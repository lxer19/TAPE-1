Reference-contexts: Component Values At the frequencies we are concerned with, the real impedance of free space is essentially infinite (capacitors block direct current), and the real impedance of the body is almost zero. Barber <ref> [BB84] </ref> gives resistivity figures on the order of 10m (Ohm-meters), plus or minus an order of magnitude: cerebrospinal fluid has a resistivity of :65m, wet bovine bone has 166m, blood has 1:5m, and a human arm has 2:4m longitudinally and 6:75m transverse.

Reference-contexts: used to relax the conductivity distribution so as to reduce the error between the actual sensor values and those predicted by the trial conductivity distribution.[KM90, DL81] A very interesting variational formulation of the inversion problem, which provides explicit estimate of the quality of the reconstruction, is developed by Berryman in <ref> [Ber89] </ref> and by Berryman and Kohn in [BK90]. They show that there is a close analogy between the electrical impedance tomography problem and the seismic travel-time inversion problem, which they solve using Fermat's principle. 1.2.4 Field Sensing Hierarchy For many human interface applications, a full image may not be desirable.

Reference-contexts: The impedance of C 1 is denoted C 1p = 1 i!C . For the TL082CP op-amp used in the Fish front end, e n is 18nV p Hz <ref> [Dev95] </ref>. This yields a voltage noise of 0:12mV rms. The current noise is 8:31 fi 10 18 V and the Johnson noise is 9:95 fi 10 7 V .

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this chapter we will outline the derivation of the circuit description from the quasi-static approximation to the Maxwell equations, following the treatment in Chapter 6 of Fano, Chu, and Adler <ref> [FCA60] </ref>. <p> Because of the linearity of all the equations involved, the total charge on i induced by all the other conductors is the sum of the separately induced 22 charges <ref> [FCA60] </ref> (note that the capacitances are not linear functions of position): Q i = j The off-diagonal terms of this capacitance matrix C ij represent the ratio between Q i and V j when all the other V s are zero.

The essence of the approach is to view imaging (or proximity detecting, or hand finding) as an inference problem. We define a model whose parameters we wish to know, and a probability distribution over those parameters.

Reference-contexts: The sensors can be used in a variety of ways, explained below, each of which modifies these capacitances differently. We measure capacitance by measuring the current arriving at the receiver, as explained in section 2.1 and 2.2.6. 23 24 2.3.1 Transmit Mode In transmit mode <ref> [GZA95] </ref>, the transmit electrode is put in contact with the user's body, which then becomes a transmitter, either because of direct electrical connection, or AC coupling through the clothes, which is shown as current path C 1 in the circuit diagram.

Reference-contexts: In fact, to determine the capacitance due to a body with a complex shape, Haus <ref> [HM89] </ref> (p. 274) recommends immersing the body in a tank filled with electrolytes and making conduction measurements, which he feels are easier experimentally. Equation 2.21 describes the general forward problem in Electrical Impedance Tomography. Technically, equation 2.20 describes the forward problem in Electric Field Tomography.

Reference-contexts: The proof of the Fourier Slice Theorem, following Kak and Slaney <ref> [KS88] </ref>, is straightforward: Consider the coordinate system (t; s), a rotated version of (x; y): " s = cos sin # " y (A:1) In this coordinate system, a projection along lines of constant t is written P = 1 Its Fourier Transform is given by S (!) = 1 Z <p> Now that we have explained the Fourier Slice Theorem, we can use it to analyse the process of collecting projections. This will lead us to the backprojection algorithm. The following explanation of backprojection is a combination of Kak <ref> [KS88] </ref>, Rosen [Ros95], and my own explanation. The Fourier Slice Theorem tells us that a series of projections in increments of 10 degrees, for example, provides a set of samples of the Fourier transform plane along a set of lines 10 degrees apart, as shown in Figure A-2.

Reference-contexts: The quadrature sum of all the three intrinsic noise figures is essentially the same as that of the voltage figure, 0:119mV . The Fish board uses the 8-bit analog to digital converter on the Motorola MC68HC11, 15 which has 1=2 least significant bit accuracy <ref> [Mot91] </ref>, so the quantization resolution is 5V =256 = :195V . Since the quantization noise is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic noise of the op-amp, we expect the readings to show the Gaussian profile typical of quantization noise.

Reference-contexts: Paradiso later applied these ideas in an accelerator alignment problem.[Par94, PM94] The Physics and Media Group of the MIT Media Lab has developed this EF sensing technology further into non-contact sensors that detect the bulk conductivity of the human body <ref> [ZSP + 95] </ref>. When part of a human body, which is typically coupled to ground, enters the field set up by a transmitter and receiver, some of the displacement current is diverted from the receiver and shunted to ground. <p> allow us to predict efficiently the sensor values resulting from a simple matter distribution. 13 Chapter 2 Physics of Electric Field Sensing In this chapter we will describe the hardware we use for Electric Field Sensing, and then discuss the physics underlying the hardware. 2.1 Hardware The Electric Field Sensors <ref> [Ger93, ZSP + 95] </ref> developed in the Physics Group of the MIT Media Laboratory provide high-precision, low-noise measurements of the bulk conductivity of a matter distribution.
