Abstract: We suggest the use of the color correlogram as a generic indexing tool to tackle various computer vision problems. Correlograms were shown to be very effective for content-based image retrieval [4]. We adapt the correlogram to handle the problems of image subregion querying, object localization, object tracking, and cut detection. Experimental results suggest that the color correlogram is much more effective than the histogram for these applications, with insignificant additional computational, storage, or processing cost. We also provide a technique to cut down the storage requirement of correlograms so that it is the same as that of histograms, with only negligible performance penalty compared to the original correlogram.

Reference-contexts: To handle such queries, the system has to find which frames contain the specified object or person, and has to locate the object in those frames. The color histogram is a general and flexible tool that can be used for the various tasks described above <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. In this study, we investigate the applicability of color correlo-grams to these tasks, and show that correlograms also constitute a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of problems. <p> Different cut detectors use different features to compute the similarity between consecutive frames, e.g. pixel difference, statistical differences, histogram comparisons, edge differences, etc <ref> [1] </ref>. Histograms are most commonly used to detect cuts because they are efficient to compute and insensitive to camera motions. They are not robust to local changes in images, however, so false positives easily occur in this method (see Figure 4). <p> Performance Measure. Recall and precision are usually used to measure the performance of cut detection algorithms, but it is difficult to compare the performance of different algorithms based on recall vs. precision curves <ref> [1] </ref>. We therefore look at recall and precision values separately. In order to avoid using optimal threshold values, we use precision vs. scope to measure false positives and recall vs. scope to measure false negatives (misses). We choose two scope values: ( ~ I) and 2 ( ~ I). <p> The color histogram has shown its efficiency and advantages as a general tool for various applications, such as content-based image retrieval [3, 7, 9], object indexing and localization [14, 6, 2], and cut detection for video segmentation <ref> [1] </ref>. As a feature vector for image retrieval, the color histogram is very easy to compute and insensitive to small changes in viewing positions. However, due to the lack of any spatial information, the histogram is liable to false positives. This problem is especially acute for large databases.

Reference-contexts: Correlogram Correction. To alleviate the problems with histogram backprojection, we incorporate local spatial correlation information by using a correlogram correction factor in Equation 3. The idea is to integrate discriminating local characteristics while avoiding local color template matching <ref> [2] </ref>. We define a local correlogram contribution based on the autocorrelogram of the subimage Ij p so that the goodness of a pixel depends on its position in addition to its color. <p> The color histogram has shown its efficiency and advantages as a general tool for various applications, such as content-based image retrieval [3, 7, 9], object indexing and localization <ref> [14, 6, 2] </ref>, and cut detection for video segmentation [1].

Reference-contexts: The general problem of content-based image retrieval has been widely studied [3, 7, 9, 8]. The color correlogram was recently proposed as an image feature vector in <ref> [4] </ref> and was shown to be very effective and efficient for content-based image retrieval. While most image retrieval systems retrieve images based on overall image comparison, users are typically interested in object searching, where the user specifies an interesting subregion (usually an interesting object) of an image as a query. <p> Since local correlations between colors are more significant than global correlations in an image, a small value of d is sufficient to capture the spatial correlation. Correlograms were shown to be both efficient and effective feature vectors for content-based image re trieval <ref> [4] </ref>. For two images I; J , jI J j h (resp. jI J j fl ) denotes the distance between the images when histograms (resp. correlograms) are used as feature vectors. Performance Measure. Let I i be the unique correct answer for Q i . <p> Note that a method is good if it has a low r-measure and a high p 1 -measure. Banded Correlogram. Though it was shown in <ref> [4] </ref> that small values of d actually suffice, it would be more advantageous if the storage requirements of correlogram were trimmed further. This leads to the definition of banded correlogram for a given b. <p> However, due to the lack of any spatial information, the histogram is liable to false positives. This problem is especially acute for large databases. Moreover, the histogram is not robust to large appearance changes. Several recently proposed schemes incorporate spatial information about colors to improve upon the histogram method <ref> [12, 13, 8, 4] </ref>. One approach [12, 13] divides images into subregions and imposes positional constraints on the image comparison (image partitioning). Another approach [8] augments histograms with local spatial properties (histogram refinement). Our approach, the color correlogram [4], makes use of spatial correlation between pairs of colors. <p> One approach [12, 13] divides images into subregions and imposes positional constraints on the image comparison (image partitioning).

Reference-contexts: Efficiency is also required in this task because huge amounts of data need to be processed. Template matching is one straightforward approach to the location problem. This method is likely to yield good results, but is computationally expensive. Attempts have been made to make template matching more efficient <ref> [5] </ref>. The histogram backprojection method is one such approach to this problem [14]. Though this method generally works well in practice, it has some serious drawbacks.
