Abstract: New technologies and the demand for extensive customisation lead to products which in many cases require diverse engineering skills and facilities an thus extensive collaboration among organisations, groups or people during product development. Motivated by the example of the development of large and complex particle detectors at the high energy physics laboratory CERN, a product model is proposed concentrating on aspects crucial for such engineering collaboration. The model abstracts from detailed data e.g. about a products geometry and topology and comprises aggregations of product data as mutual reference points during the collaborative development process. Careful consideration is given to the applicability of an engineering support system based on that model in an environment where hierarchical control is usually insufficient to support a development process highly dependent on peoples flexibility, creativity and motivation for collaboration. Instead the system is devised as a means for collaboration support and self-organisation.

Reference-contexts: Most developers of object oriented databases now pay special attention to the requirements of collaborative engineering through concepts like version/configuration management and shared workspaces etc. <ref> [Ahme91] </ref>. Besides collaboration and its support in terms of technical facilities, our approach is based on the idea of product models. Most R&D on such models is now conducted in the context of the (ISO) Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP 3 ).

Reference-contexts: Yet experience e.g with production planning systems shows that organizational means, if applied top-down, may undermine to the necessary aim of flexibility in complex environments. 6 The Oxford Dictionary defines collaboration as to "work together, esp. to create or to produce something". Bair <ref> [Bair89] </ref> defines collaboration in the context of coordination and collaboration, whereas coordination is not necessarily based on shared goals and serves the harmonization among individual activities collaboration is a team process based on common goals; results are evaluated as individual contributions cooperation is based on genuine team spirit with the sublimation

Reference-contexts: Software engineering naturally comprises a strong affinity for support through information technology. Accordingly human aspects of the work process (e.g. "chief programmer team" <ref> [Bake73] </ref>, "egoless programming" [Wein71]) as well as methodological and technical concepts (e.g. CASE, Integrated Project Support Environments) have been extensively discussed as independent as well as interdependent factors.

Reference-contexts: Working in a truly transparent mode would require the instant access to remotely located data and - in case of servicing detailed, high volume product data - transmission rates thus far not generally provided in Europe <ref> [Carp92a] </ref>. A current typical speed of 64 kbit/s would impose a delay in the range hours for not even extraordinary large object sizes. Current experiments already with gigabit testbeds in the USA indicate that the problem of transmission speed will become in most cases negligible during the next years. 6.2.

Reference-contexts: Important results of such collaboration can be seen, among others, in areas like electronics, computing, networking, signal-processing, cryogenics and super-conducting magnets [CERN88]. For instance, key contributions to the development of computer networks, which become more and more important for business and industry, have been made by the physics community <ref> [Carp92b] </ref>. In Geneva CERN is operating the worlds largest research instrument, the LEP (Large Electron Positron) collider. The accelerator machine itself is located in an underground tunnel of 27 km circumference. <p> Within the research institutes, electronic mail, electronic news, file transfer and hypertext based information retrieval systems are in daily use. Such Photo) tools are increasingly employed in the industry as well, although the acceptance within Europe is slower compared with the United States <ref> [Carp92b] </ref>. 1.2. Objectives Based on the situation as describe above, the paper identifies the requirements for collaboration support during product development in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Collaboration support can be achieved basically by using available information technology for networking and data storage.

An important re-quirement for the application of CAD systems in heterogeneous system environments is to be able to transfer CAD data into a format readable by a different system. Interfaces between different CAD systems are usually based on neutral file formats or dedicated bilateral converters.

Reference-contexts: Unmatched human qualities like flexibility, learning capability, and the ability to communicate on a conceptual level are considered again as crucial assets. E.g. the chief personnel planner of VW states that "Teamwork, cutback of hierarchies and promotion of creativity are the most important elements of the work organization today" <ref> [Haas92] </ref>. The emergence of the idea of concurrent engineering (or simultaneous engineering) can be seen as a reaction to the insufficiencies of mere technological approaches. <p> programmers time is spent in communication rather than programming."

Teamwork allows to view simultaneously and integrate the different aspects of a complex problem. Joint individual capabilities induce synergy and thus increase overall performance.

Reference-contexts: Yet the question for the potentials of Artificial Intelligence seems to remain a controversial issue for years to come. 5 Experience from software engineering underlines the importance of social activities: "In large software development projects, the preponderance of an individual programmers time is spent in communication rather than programming." <ref> [Kras87] </ref> are keys for a successful implementation of information technology mechanisms as supportive means of engineering work: Not individual excellence but the joint effort of teams is now seen as a main factor of successful product development (see e.g. [Lock92], [Schr90], [Haas92]). <p> Projects aiming to extensively exploit the potential benefits of teamwork face the risk to create a network of dependencies which makes is extremely difficult or impossible for the individual engineer to maintain a correct view of the state of development <ref> [Kras87] </ref>. We use the term transparency to denote the ideal situation where any data or information required for a certain task is immediately accessible and the meaning (e.g. with respect to validity) of this data or information is clear 7,8 . <p> To judge the adequacy of the system concept the following two arguments are to be considered: Firstly, collaboration during engineering of complex products, so not impossible, would be indeed inefficient without some form of support providing a common basis for communication <ref> [Kras87] </ref>. Computer support greatly eases the handling of large amounts of data, provides reliability with repetitive tasks and enables communication independent of time and location. Therefore the system is to be judged on its actual scope and functionality.

Reference-contexts: All of the detectors where developed by large international projects. As an example, the construction of the L3 detector involved 460 scientists and engineers from 34 laboratories representing 13 countries <ref> [L390] </ref>. Such development is typically structured through the decomposition into sub-detectors and several subprojects working on a single sub-detector. Different engineering domains (mechanical, piping/cooling, electrical, electronics etc.) have to operate in parallel and aim for integration within the same overall product.

Reference-contexts: The bottom-up approach to organization is self-organization <ref> [Mali84] </ref>. Collaboration is to be supported in such a way that an engineering team itself is able to successfully cover the organizational tasks which lay in its own scope and that organization becomes and inherent task of the collaborative product development process. 4.

Reference-contexts: These include tools like version and configuration management systems and project libraries and approaches like process modelling ([Fern89][Kras91]) and cooperation and self organization <ref> [Pasc89] </ref>.

Thus algorithmic supplants for human cognitive skills are confined to specific, well-defined sub-problems or as supportive means for human activities 4 . Engineering is to be also understood as a social activity when the overall result represents more than an individual contribution or the mere sum of individual contributions.
