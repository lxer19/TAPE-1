Title: Supporting Mobility in MosquitoNet  
Author: Mary G. Baker, Xinhua Zhao, Stuart Cheshire, Jonathan Stone 
Affiliation: Stanford University  
Abstract: The goal of the MosquitoNet project is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile hosts. Mobile hosts must be able to take advantage of the best network connectivity available in any location, whether wired or wireless. We have implemented a mobile IP system that supports seamless switching between different networks and communication devices. In contrast to previous approaches to mobile IP, we believe mobile hosts should not assume any explicit mobility support from the networks they visit, aside from basic Internet connectivity. This decision places extra responsibilities on the mobile hosts themselves. In this paper, we describe the design and implications of such a system. Measurements of our implementation show that the inherent overhead to switch networks (below 10ms) is insignificant compared to the time required to bring up a new communication device.

Reference-contexts: While it is optimized for localized mobility, it is hard to scale beyond the scope of a single organization such as a university. The IMHP (Internet Mobile Host Protocol) [13] and the Harvard system <ref> [2] </ref> are roughly the same, though they were developed independently. The strong point of the proposals is that they can provide host mobility over a wide area and converge to an optimal route efficiently.

Reference-contexts: We have written a Linux driver (STRIP) that allows us to run IP over the radios Starmode. In theory, Met-ricom radios can send 100 Kbits/second through the air, but in practice 30-40 Kbits/second is the best we achieve <ref> [3] </ref>. We use a Pentium 90 as the router to the home network of our mobile hosts. It is also usually used as the home agent for the mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our approach only requires of the host network its ability to provide a dynamically-assigned temporary IP care-of address for the mobile host itself. This IP address could be assigned by hand, but this functionality is more easily provided automatically by DHCP <ref> [4] </ref> or other link-level address negotiations such as those used by PPP and SLIP services. Without a foreign agent, networking software in the mobile host decapsulates the tunneled packets. In effect, we have collocated a simple foreign agent on the mobile host itself.

Reference-contexts: The difference in the assignment of care-of addresses between our design and designs that use foreign agents is further illustrated in Section 5.1. Below we compare some previous mobile IP systems to our work. The Columbia system <ref> [6] </ref> takes the so-called embedded network approach. The approach requires a special kind of router, called a Mobile Support Router. The Mobile Support Routers work closely together to make the partitioned physical networks (called cells) appear as a single subnet.

Reference-contexts: The goal is that our wireless devices will provide a constantly available network connection, while the wired devices will provide a faster connection where available. Our mobile hosts are Gateway 2000 Handbook486s running Linux <ref> [8] </ref>. The Handbooks are 40 Mhz subnotebooks that weigh less than three pounds and are thus very comfortable to carry around. Each Handbook has a PCMCIA card slot that we use for Ethernet connectivity with a Linksys Ethernet card.

Reference-contexts: This technique can be applied to other identifiers, such as group identifiers for multicast communications, making this a general mechanism. But this approach also has the problem of requiring many changes to existing routers. The current draft of the IETF Mobile IP Working Group <ref> [10] </ref> is similar to the IMHP and the Harvard system, but it differs from them in that it treats the support for optimal routing as an extension.

Reference-contexts: There will be a large IP address space, resulting in less resistance to handing out temporary addresses. Also, it appears there may be support for bindings in routers between static addresses and care-of addresses, further reducing the role of a foreign agent <ref> [12] </ref>. Disadvantages: Main disadvantage: The mobile host needs to acquire a temporary IP address in the foreign network.

Reference-contexts: Each Handbook has a PCMCIA card slot that we use for Ethernet connectivity with a Linksys Ethernet card. Each Handbook also has a 115.2 Kbit/second serial port that we use to connect to our wireless devices. Our wireless devices are Metricom radio modems <ref> [14] </ref>. While these devices are commonly used to emulate a Hayes modem for point-to-point connections, Metricom also provides a connectionless datagram mode, called Starmode, that enables a radio to send packets to any number of other radios individually.

Reference-contexts: Many of the components that make up the Internet exercise the option to drop packets occasionally when the cost of doing otherwise would be unreasonable. Internet protocols do not naively assume perfect delivery, but instead use end-to-end mechanisms to achieve a level of reliability appropriate to their particular needs <ref> [15] </ref>. Unless further experience with our system dictates that our potentially higher packet loss is a severe handicap, we will stick to our simple implementation. More complex mobile host: The lack of foreign agents somewhat complicates the design of the mobile host.

Reference-contexts: But to obtain optimal routing, the MHs previous FA, its CHs, and the routers along the way (called cache agents) are used to cache the location binding for the MH. The problem with this is that it requires adding this extra support to many entities in the Internet. VIP <ref> [16] </ref> places even more requirements on the existing infrastructure of the Internet. Its key point is to separate logical identifiers from physical identifiers. The network layer is divided into two sublayers: a Virtual Network Sublayer and a Physical Network Sublayer.
