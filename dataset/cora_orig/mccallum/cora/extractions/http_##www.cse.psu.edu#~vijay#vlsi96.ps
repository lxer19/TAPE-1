Abstract: The problem of finding subcircuits in a larger circuit arises in many contexts in computer-aided design. In this paper, we present an approach to model the subcircuit extraction problem using genetic representation and control and propose a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm called SUBGEN, can be applied to identify subcircuits in a large circuit graph and is independent of circuit and technology factors. Results are presented based on applying the proposed algorithm to select CMOS circuits.

Reference-contexts: We present a technology and circuit independent solution for identifying subcircuits in larger circuits using a genetic approach. A given circuit can be represented as a graph G = (V1, E1), where V1 is the set of nodes and E1 is the edges <ref> [4] </ref>. The circuit contains two types of nodes: device and terminal nodes. The network nodes can further be identified as internal nodes or external nodes based on their connectivity. A network node that is connected only between nodes internal to the subcir-cuit is called an internal node.
