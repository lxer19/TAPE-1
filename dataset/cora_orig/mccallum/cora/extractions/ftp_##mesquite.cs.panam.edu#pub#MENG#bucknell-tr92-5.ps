Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In our LSFT model <ref> [Finkel 92] </ref>, two thresholds are used, T H v , the overload threshold and T H f , the full load threshold. These two thresholds separate the values of the queue length, L into 5 different regions, i.e. <p> This position-wise relationship is unique and very important in setting up the linear equation system by program. 3 Comparison with M/M/1 Model To validate the solution method, comparisons with M/M/1 model (without load sharing) and with simulation model of LSFT were made. For the comparison with simulation results, see <ref> [Finkel 92] </ref>. The following tables show the results of comparison between the truncated Markov model without load sharing and exact M/M/1. From the comparison, we can see that the approximation model needs many more states to reach an acceptable solution, than the model with load sharing.
