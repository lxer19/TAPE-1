Abstract: Hypertext is a generalization of the conventional linear text into a non-linear text formed by adding cross-reference and structural links between different pieces of text. A hypertext can be regarded as an extension of a textual database by adding a link structure among the different text objects it stores. We present a tool for finding information in a distributed hypertext such as the World-Wide Web (WWW). Such a hypertext is a distributed textual database in which text objects residing at (the same and) different sites have links to each other. In such a database retrieval is limited to the transfer of documents with a known name. Names of documents serve as links between different documents, and finding such references names is only possible by parsing documents that have embedded links to other documents. Full-text search in such hypertexts is not feasible because of the discrepancy between the large size of the hypertext and the relatively low bandwidth of the network. We present an information retrieval algorithm for distributed hypertexts, which does an incomplete search through a part of the hypertext. Heuristics determine the selection of the documents that are to be retrieved and searched. A prototype implementation for the WWW, on top of Mosaic for X, is being used by an increasingly large user base.

Reference-contexts: The amount of disturbance generated by the cross-reference links is measured using two metrics, compactness and stratum. Compactness measures how many links one must follow (on average) to move between two arbitrary nodes. Stratum measures the amount of reading order in a hypertext. In <ref> [3] </ref> navigation efficiency (or difficulty) is measured when taking into account different navigation aids offered by hypertext systems. Getting from one node to another becomes easier when history lists and/or hotlists are available. <p> These facilities cannot simply be modeled by adding extra links to the hypertext in order to calculate their effect on the metrics or to count the number of cross-reference links they would generate. In <ref> [3] </ref> a large number of experiments (with simulated users) were conducted in order to find the influence of navigation aids on browsing. <p> Also, the order determines which links the user perceives as being structural (hierarchical) links and which links appear to be cross-reference links. In <ref> [3] </ref> different browsing strategies, ranging from breadth-first to depth-first have been evaluated. The hypertexts that were used in the experiments included those of the work of Erica de Vries [4, 5] and the book [9] by Shneiderman and Kearsley, as well as some artificially generated structures.

The hypertexts that were used in the experiments included those of the work of Erica de Vries [4, 5] and the book [9] by Shneiderman and Kearsley, as well as some artificially generated structures. The conclusion in [3], which is crucial for the algorithm we present is : For all hypertext structures, and for all kinds of navigational aids or combinations thereof, the depth-first navigation strategy is most effective in finding cross-reference links and in traversing a hypertext in as few steps as possible. <p> Depth-first search is generally better than breadth-first, except when there is very little time <ref> [3] </ref>. (This means the school moves on, rather than staying in the same neighborhood for too long and risking to die of starvation.) 5. <p> However, since we cannot retrieve all nodes in the distributed hypertext, we need a strategy that selects an order of retrieval which provides a reasonable distribution of the nodes within the hypertext. In <ref> [3] </ref> the distribution of nodes is not measured directly but the number of cross-reference links that are discovered is measured instead. Each time a cross-reference link is found a gateway is discovered that leads to another part of the hypertext. <p> Our algorithm favors links to different sites because of the penetration they provide into different parts of the hypertext, and also because successive network accesses should preferably not be concentrated on the same part of the network. The experiments in <ref> [3] </ref> show that depth-first navigation results in the discovery of the largest number of cross-reference links, regardless the structure of the hypertext or the navigation aids offered by the system. The algorithm keeps a sorted list (of URL's of nodes to retrieve).

Reference-contexts: An interesting variation in [7] presents the result of a search as a guided tour, generated by using the relevance scores and the link types. In this paper we concentrate on distributed hypertexts such as the World-Wide Web. Unlike the distributed hypermedia storage system described in <ref> [8] </ref>, the computer systems carrying the parts of the World-Wide Web are only loosely coupled, somewhat like heterogeneous multidatabase systems (but without a database scheme and without a DBMS). Each site is completely autonomous, and offers a simple interface (protocol) to the other sites.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A simple definition of hypertext (mostly taken from <ref> [9] </ref>) is a database of (textual) information fragments (nodes) that has active cross-references (links) and allows the reader to jump to other parts of the database as desired. Most hypertext systems have a limited view on the jumps the reader may desire. <p> In [3] different browsing strategies, ranging from breadth-first to depth-first have been evaluated. The hypertexts that were used in the experiments included those of the work of Erica de Vries [4, 5] and the book <ref> [9] </ref> by Shneiderman and Kearsley, as well as some artificially generated structures.
