Reference-contexts: It is an integrated environment, the system itself being defined in Smalltalk, and so there is only one paradigm: objects that receive messages. We briefly review Smalltalk using the objects defined for our application. Goldberg and Rob-son <ref> [1] </ref> should be consulted for full details on the language and the system defined classes; Gold-berg [2] describes the programming environment. Kahler and Patterson [4] also develop an application in Smalltalk and through it one learns how to use the environment.
