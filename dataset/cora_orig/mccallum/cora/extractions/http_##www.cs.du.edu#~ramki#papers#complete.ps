Reference-contexts: A graph theoretic function g is said to satisfy the edge Lipschitz condition if whenever graphs H and H 0 differ in only one edge, then jg (H) g (H 0 )j 1, see <ref> [AS 92, p. 86] </ref>. Observe that (k; G) satisfies the edge Lipschitz condition. Moreover, the optimal size of a b-matching satisfies the edge Lipschitz condition, and so do most functions related to matchings of graphs. In contrast, both 0 (k; G) and 00 (k; G) violate this condition.

Clearly, a k-connected (i.e., k-node connected or k-edge connected) graph has at least kn=2 edges, since each node has degree k. <p> The running time for the second step is O (kjEj 2 ).

The next result strengthens Theorem 3.5 for bipartite graphs. The proof is via Gupta's theorem. Another brief proof follows from Proposition 3.10. Proposition 3.8 Let B fl = (X [ Y ; E fl ) be a bipartite graph with minimum degree k. <p> Another result of Gupta, see <ref> [BM 76, Problem 6.2.8] </ref>, shows that (k 2; G)=(k; G) (k 2)=(k 1) for all graphs G of minimum degree k.

Reference-contexts: Since jE opt j kjV j=2, the minimum-size k-ECSS heuristic achieves an approximation guarantee of 1 + [2=(k + 1)] for k 1. The next lemma turns out to be quite useful. A straightforward counting argument gives the proof, see Mader [Ma 71, Lemma 1], or Cai <ref> [Ca 93, Claim 3] </ref>. <p> : : : ; A ` g, where A i V (H) and ffi (A i ) is a k-cut, for 1 i `, such that each edge e 2 F 0 is in some ffi (A i ), 1 i `.

It is convenient to define a tree T corresponding to F [ fV (H)g: there is a T -node corresponding to each set A i 2 <p> Frank [Fr 93] and by M. Cai <ref> [Ca 93] </ref>. Theorem 4.3 Let H = (V; E) be a k-edge connected, n-node graph (k 1). Let M E be an edge set such that the spanning subgraph (V; M ) has minimum degree k. <p> The number of special edges is at most kjV (H)j, since by Mader's result [Ma 72], the maximum number of critical edges in a k-edge connected graph H is at most kjV (H)j. Based on theorems of Cai <ref> [Ca 93] </ref>, we give a bound of 6jV (H)j (independent of k) on the number of special edges in H, see Proposition 4.8. <p> Each special edge of H is in some k-cut that corresponds to a T -edge. Hence, the number of special edges is at most k jE (T )j k jV (T )j. To estimate jV (T )j, we apply Theorems 5 and 6 of Cai <ref> [Ca 93] </ref>, with slight modifications. One point to note is that Theorems 5,6 of [Ca 93] are stated for minimal k-edge connected graphs, but an examination of the proofs shows that these theorems apply to all k-edge connected (undirected) graphs. <p> Hence, the number of special edges is at most k jE (T )j k jV (T )j.

Reference-contexts: For example, consider the metric TSP, i.e., the Traveling Salesman Problem with edge weights satisfying the triangle inequality. Finding a solution whose value is within a factor of two of optimum is trivial. The Christofides heuristic <ref> [Ch 76] </ref> broke the 2-approximation barrier by employing a powerful idea: matching. Given a graph, consider the problem of finding a minimum-size 2-edge connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS), or a minimum-size 2-node connected spanning subgraph (2-NCSS). Several recent papers have focused on these two problems.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, a k-connected (i.e., k-node connected or k-edge connected) graph has at least kn=2 edges, since each node has degree k. Similarly, every k-connected digraph has at least kn arcs (directed edges) since each node has outdegree k, and results of Edmonds <ref> [Ed 72] </ref> and Mader [Ma 85] imply that every minimal k-connected digraph has at most 2kn arcs.

Reference-contexts: This can be improved by implementing the second step to run in time O (k 3 jV j 2 ). We run Gabow's algorithm <ref> [Ga 95] </ref> as a preprocessing step to compute a sparse certificate e E of G for k-edge connectivity, i.e., e E E, j e Ej 2kjV j, and for all nodes v; w, (V; e E) has k arc-disjoint v!w directed paths iff G has k arc-disjoint v!w directed paths. <p> In detail, we fix a node a 2 V (G) and take e E = e E out [ e E in , where e E out ( e E in ) is the union of k arc-disjoint out-branchings (in-branchings) rooted at a. Gabow's algorithm <ref> [Ga 95] </ref> runs in time O (kjV j 2 ), and the second step runs in time O (kj e E [ M j 2 ) = O (k 3 jV j 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Given a graph, consider the problem of finding a minimum-size 2-edge connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS), or a minimum-size 2-node connected spanning subgraph (2-NCSS). Several recent papers have focused on these two problems. Khuller & Vishkin <ref> [KV 94] </ref> achieved the first significant advance by obtaining approximation guarantees of 1.5 and 1.66 for the minimum-size 2-ECSS problem and the minimum-size 2-NCSS problem. Garg et al [GSS 93] improved the approximation guarantee of the latter problem to 1:5.

Reference-contexts: A graph G is called factor-critical if for every node v 2 V , there is a perfect matching in Gnv, see <ref> [LP 86] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, a k-connected (i.e., k-node connected or k-edge connected) graph has at least kn=2 edges, since each node has degree k. Similarly, every k-connected digraph has at least kn arcs (directed edges) since each node has outdegree k, and results of Edmonds [Ed 72] and Mader <ref> [Ma 85] </ref> imply that every minimal k-connected digraph has at most 2kn arcs. <p> The running time of the heuristic is O (kjEj 2 ), and for graphs the running time improves to O (k 3 jV j 2 + jEj 1:5 (log jV j) 2 ).

In the context of augmenting the node connectivity of graphs and digraphs, the first application of Mader's theorems is due to Jordan [Jo 95, Jo 93]. <p> The analysis of the heuristic for digraphs is similar, and hinges on another theorem of Mader <ref> [Ma 85, Theorem 1] </ref>, which may be regarded as the generalization of [Ma 72, Theorem 1] to digraphs. <p> The key tool in the analysis of the approximation guarantee is another theorem of Mader, <ref> [Ma 85, Theorem 1] </ref>. <p> Recall that an arc e of a k-node connected digraph H is called critical if Hne is not k-node connected. Here is Mader's theorem on the critical arcs of a k-node connected digraph; see Figure 4 for an illustration. Theorem 3.17 (Mader <ref> [Ma 85, Theorem 1] </ref>) In a k-node connected digraph, if there is an alternating cycle C each of whose arcs is critical, then there is either a C-out node of outdegree k or a C-in node of indegree k. <p> Theorem 3.17 (Mader [Ma 85, Theorem 1]) In a k-node connected digraph, if there is an alternating cycle C each of whose arcs is critical, then there is either a C-out node of outdegree k or a C-in node of indegree k. Fact 3.18 (Mader <ref> [Ma 85, Lemma 2] </ref>) Let H be a digraph, and let B (H) be the associated bipartite graph. There is a cycle in B (H) iff there is an alternating cycle in H. <p> Fact 3.18 (Mader [Ma 85, Lemma 2]) Let H be a digraph, and let B (H) be the associated bipartite graph. There is a cycle in B (H) iff there is an alternating cycle in H. Remarks: Mader <ref> [Ma 85] </ref> states the theorem for minimal k-node connected digraphs, but in fact, his proof needs only the fact that every arc in the alternating cycle is critical. <p> Now, consider a digraph H 0 that is obtained from an arbitrary strongly connected digraph by subdividing every arc at least once (i.e., an arc is replaced by 1 new nodes and a directed path of 2 arcs). Note that H 0 contains no alternating cycle. Mader <ref> [Ma 85, p. 104] </ref> shows that there exists a minimal k-node connected digraph G such that H 0 is contained in the subgraph of G induced by arcs whose start nodes have outdegrees &gt; k and whose end nodes have indegrees &gt; k. <p> Every C-out node has outdegree &gt; k = 1, and every C-in node has indegree &gt; k = 1. None of the arcs in the alternating cycle is critical for 1-connectivity. This example is modified from an example of Mader <ref> [Ma 85] </ref>. 18 The previous lemma immediately gives an approximation guarantee of 1 + [2=k] for a minimum--size k-NCSS of a digraph, because the "degree lower bound" implies that a digraph k-NCSS has kjV j arcs.
