Note: 45 Chapter 4 Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications for AVCS Platooning  
Abstract: As seen in previous chapters, vehicle-to-vehicle radio links suffer from multipath fading and interference from other vehicles. This chapter discusses the impact of these effects on communication networks supporting, in particular, AVCS. The statistical models for this channel are used to evaluate the performance of a network involving many links. The performance of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA), and Frequency Hopping with TDMA in this environment are compared. Reliability of the radio link is investigated by specifying the radio spectrum occupation for a given required reliability of the radio link.

Reference-contexts: Highway lanes could be much narrower 47 once automated. High-precision vehicle-follower control appears possible when dynamic data obtained by ranging sensors are combined with communication between cars. <ref> [3] </ref> We consider AVCS in a platoon environment, where a platoon consists of N vehicles. As depicted in Fig. 4.1, the distance between vehicles is denoted as d h , and is on the order of 1 or 2 meters [4].

Reference-contexts: 4.1 Introduction In order to combat the effects of multipath fading and associated doppler shift as well as interference from other links multiple access schemes such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA), and Frequency Hopping with TDMA are investigated. Shladover <ref> [4] </ref> and Hitchcock [8] have shown that message delays within a platoon environment can have dire consequences. <p> Section 4.6 discusses network protocol and frequency sharing procedures. In Section 4.7 the numerical results of the issues discussed in the preceding sections are formulated. Section 4.8 summarizes these results and draws conclusions and recommendations of this study. 4.2 Platoon Model Shladover, et al., <ref> [4] </ref> have proposed a method of efficient vehicle control by grouping vehicles in platoons. It requires electronically linked cars to travel in instrumented lanes with facilities to allow the vehicles to join and exit platoons smoothly at highway speeds. <p> As depicted in Fig. 4.1, the distance between vehicles is denoted as d h , and is on the order of 1 or 2 meters <ref> [4] </ref>. The vehicle length, platoon following distance, and lane width are denoted as d v , d p , and d l respectively, while the communication link under study is denoted as d. <p> The performance of the network is quantified by finding the probability that the (n-1) th vehicle successfully transmits its report to the n th vehicle, with M 1 &lt; M 2 . In an AVCS environment the lead vehicle generates data that all vehicles in the platoon require <ref> [4] </ref>, thus we are also interested in the probability that the lead vehicle successfully transmits its report to the n th vehicle, this occurs if each hop has less than M 1 bit errors. 4.7 Numerical Results The length of each vehicle, d v, was assumed to be 5 meters; the <p> We chose T = 50 msec and call T (as other sources also refer to this) as the deadline failure probability. In our results we have assumed a maximum T=50 msec at a link distance d=10m <ref> [4] </ref>. Although CDMA C r =2, N=32 gives better PER results than TDMA, it requires much more bandwidth. Thus we can implement TDMA by requiring very frequent transmissions and though many of these transmissions would be lost, we are guaranteed a successful transmission using less bandwidth than CDMA.

Shladover [4] and Hitchcock <ref> [8] </ref> have shown that message delays within a platoon environment can have dire consequences. Thus the performance of these various multiple access schemes is quantified by Packet Erasure Rates (PER) as well as Reliability (probability of a successful message reception in a fixed time interval) for a given spectral allocation.

Reference-contexts: Thus if frequency reuse between lanes is employed, vertical polarization can be implemented in order to mitigate the effects of deep fades caused by the destructive interference between the ground reected wave and the direct line-of-sight wave. Antenna diversity can also be used to increase performance <ref> [12] </ref>. The system under study was also found to be sensitive to co-channel interference. Our analysis showed that even for CDMA transmission, performance could be largely improved if adjacent lanes use different frequencies.
