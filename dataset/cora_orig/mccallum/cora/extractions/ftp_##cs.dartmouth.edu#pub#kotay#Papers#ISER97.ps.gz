Title: Self-reconfigurable Robots for Navigation and Manipulation  
Author: Keith Kotay and Daniela Rus 
Address: Hanover, NH 03755, USA  
Affiliation: Dartmouth Robotics Laboratory Department of Computer Science Dartmouth  
Abstract: Self-reconfigurable robots consist of a set of one or more identical autonomous modules that can adapt their shape and function to tasks. We describe a module that can function as a climbing robot, a manipulator, or a leg in a multi-legged walker. This module can make autonomous transitions between these states. We present the control algorithms that enable our robot to be a versatile navigator and manipulator and report on our experimental results.

Reference-contexts: Inchworm robots are capable of a variety of manipulation and navigation modalities by themselves, or cooperating as a distributed system. Universal molecules are capable of aggregating as arbitrary three dimensional structures. In this paper we describe the Inchworm robot <ref> [KR96] </ref>, a module that can be an autonomous navigator of three-dimensional structures, a manipulator, a multi-legged walker (where each leg is an inchworm), and a snake (with several inchworms connected together in a linear structure.) More specifically, each Inchworm robot can (1) function as an autonomous navigator of three dimensional structures, <p> that implements a move from one surface to another surface when the relative orientation between the surfaces ranges from 45 to 90 degrees relative to the first surface. (Transitions to surfaces whose relative orientation is between 1 and 45 degrees are implemented as part of a step as explained in <ref> [KR96] </ref>). <p> surface when the relative orientation between the surfaces ranges from -45 to -90 degrees relative to the first surface. (Transitions to surfaces whose relative orientation is between -1 and -45 degrees are implemented as part of a step in the same way as for a concave transition as explained in <ref> [KR96] </ref>). <p> The reason for this is that the Inchworm does not have a backward facing sensor to detect the position of the object. We intend to add a sensor to overcome this limitation. Each pulling experiment included two step tasks, and this data was added to the data presented in <ref> [KR96] </ref>. The result is 200 successful steps out of 210 tries. The globally-controlled leg data consists of data for the stride component of the pulling experiment. This was done because a stride consists of the leg motion which would be used for each Inchworm in the multi-legged walker.
