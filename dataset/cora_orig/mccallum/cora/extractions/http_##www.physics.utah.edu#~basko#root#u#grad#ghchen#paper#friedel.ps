Abstract: We study the static dielectric function "(q) of 2D electron system with spin-orbit coupling in the frame of the random phase approximation. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known 2k F -Kohn anomaly, spin-orbit coupling gives rise to the novel anomaly at small q = q 0 t k F , where q 0 is the distance between two Fermi surfaces. The oscillations of the potential from a point charge originating from this anomaly are studied. The remarkable feature of these oscillations is that they are not smeared out by the temperature. The magnetic field dependence of novel oscillations resulting from the Zeeman splitting is also studied and appear to be very peculiar. PACS number(s): 73.20H, 02.20.+b
