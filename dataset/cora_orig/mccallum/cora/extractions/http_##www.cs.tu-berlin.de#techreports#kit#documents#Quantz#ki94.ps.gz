Abstract: We present a Preferential Default Description Logic (PDDL) based on weighted defaults and show that the preferential entailment relation j satisfies all properties of system P and Rational Monotonicity. The main characteristics of this PDDL is that it uses an ordering between multisets of defaults for priorization, treats defaults similar to material implications, and adheres strictly to the principle of exception minimization. We furthermore show how maximization of default applications can be consistently combined with j without violating exception minimization. Furthermore, the resulting entailment relation j F still satisfies all properties of system P. We then develop a proof theory for j based on default spaces, which shows that j is decidable if the underlying DL is. j can be syntactically characterized by strict entailment from all maximal default spaces and can thus be computed by an exponential algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The main difference is the effect on implicit objects (see [14] for details). To let defaults behave like forward-chaining trigger rules instead of like material implications, the exceptions have to be defined wrt to instanceship of epistemic concepts defined with the k-operator from <ref> [5] </ref>. We are currently investigating such a logic. When defining the preference ordering on models we have to take into account the respective relevance of an exception, which is given by the weight of the default: Definition 3. Let M be a model and a finite set of weighted defaults. <p> In this case the complexity of preferential entailment is thus polynomially reducible to DL entailment. Moreover, we are currently investigating a weaker semantics based on the k operator <ref> [5] </ref>, in which contraposition and disjunctive application of defaults are not valid, i.e. defaults behave as forward-chaining trigger rules. Though the worst-case complexity for such a semantics is still exponential, computation might become much more efficient in realistic applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we present an integration of weighted defaults into Description Logics (DL). The general framework of this integration has first been proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>, where specificity wrt strict subsumption determines a priority ordering on defaults. The weighted defaults used in this paper, however, not only order individual defaults, but also multisets of defaults. Such a fine-grained priorization is motivated by an application in Natural Language Processing, more precisely by the task of disambiguation. <p> Priorization between defaults can be realized, for example, by ordering individual defaults or by ordering multisets of defaults. 3. In addition to exception minimization, maximization of default application can be considered. 4. Defaults can behave as forward-chaining trigger rules or as material implications. The logic D j presented in <ref> [13] </ref> and j are thus two different instantiations of the general framework, differing wrt the particular choices made for the above parameters. When defining j in the following section, we will indicate how definitions have to be changed to obtain different choices for the respective parameters. <p> D is a set, called the domain, and [[]] I is an interpretation function mapping concepts into subsets of D and object names from a finite set O injectively (Unique Name Assumption) into D. DL dialects differ wrt the 3 Note that the presentation in <ref> [13] </ref> is based on Shoham's preferential-model approach [18] and does not address these formal properties. concept-forming operators they contain. <p> The exceptions to ffi in M are defined as E M (ffi) = fo 2 O : [[o]] 2 [[ffi p ]] ^ [[o]] 62 [[ffi c ]] g Instead of taking O we could also take the domain D as exception base, as has been done in <ref> [13] </ref>. The main difference is the effect on implicit objects (see [14] for details). To let defaults behave like forward-chaining trigger rules instead of like material implications, the exceptions have to be defined wrt to instanceship of epistemic concepts defined with the k-operator from [5]. <p> We will illustrate below the major difference between this ordering based on weighted defaults and the one based on specificity used in <ref> [13] </ref>. Given this ordering, we can use the standard technique to define a preferential entailment relation, e.g. [7, 9]. Definition 5. Let be a set of DL formulae and M a model. <p> In this respect j differs considerably from priorized Nonmonotonic Logics like <ref> [2, 3, 8, 13, 17] </ref>. It is this property which is essential in the NLP application described in [12, 15]. It would thus be interesting to apply the framework of weighted defaults and the numerical priorization to Reiter-style Default Logics. <p> M &lt; N or In the above example we would thus get j o :: c 2 if m &gt; n and j F Interestingly, all properties of system P also hold for j F , whereas this is not the case for the corresponding specificity-based PDDL developed in <ref> [13] </ref>. This may seem surprising since &lt; F is neither transitive nor stoppered. We can show, however, that we obtain the same preferential entailment relation for &lt; F and its transitive closure fl &lt; F . <p> We can show, however, that we obtain the same preferential entailment relation for &lt; F and its transitive closure fl &lt; F . To prove this we need the following lemma: 5 Note that the definition of fulfillment preference in <ref> [13] </ref> is not correct as pointed out to us first by Franz Baader. Lemma 16. Let M 1 , M 2 , and M 3 be models. 1.

Let O be a finite set of object names and a finite set of weighted defaults. A default space S (over ) is any set of descriptions o :: : ffi p t ffi c with o 2 O and ffi 2 .
