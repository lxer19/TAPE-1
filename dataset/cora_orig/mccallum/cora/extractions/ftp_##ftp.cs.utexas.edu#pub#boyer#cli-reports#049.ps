Reference-contexts: This type of verification requires induction, which is not found in Boolean decision procedures. To demonstrate our approach we present the verification of two selector implementations by induction. 2.2 The Boyer-Moore Logic and Theorem Prover The Boyer-Moore logic <ref> [Boyer & Moore 88] </ref> is a quantifier-free, first-order predicate calculus with equality. Logic formulas are written in a prefix-style, Lisp-like notation. Included with the logic are several built-in data types: Booleans, natural numbers, lists, literal atoms, and integers.
