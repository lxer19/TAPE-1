Abstract: Nordhausen and Langleys IDS is a system for automated integrated scientific discovery. IDS is-a hierarchy both organizes knowledge and constrains search. This search bias, however, limits what may be discovered to knowledge learnable by operators that execute local tree manipulations on the is-a hierarchy. I present an alternative approach which uses representation reduction as the driving bias. This bias already is used by scientists and is motivated by Rissanens Minimum Description Length Criterion. Additionally, the bias allows search in the space of scientific models, not just behaviors. I also present a meta-learning technique whereby the program may become more efficient at reducing representations over time. The proliferation of sensors across Earth and space combined with the ease with which large datasets are maintained have brought new challenges to science. Many scientists now have more data than can be analyzed by traditional means [Fayyad et al. 1996]. Computers have long been used to help scientists calculate. Science, however, is more than calculating. Science at least also involves hypothesis generation and testing, planning, and integrating prior knowledge with new ideas. Artificial intelligence (AI) and database (DB) technologies have grown to the point where they may be able to help scientists in more meaningful ways. This paper presents a principled approach to semi-automated knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) for integrated scientific discovery and the rationale for the approach. Nordhausen and Langley developed perhaps the first system for integrated automated scientific discovery [Nordhausen & Langley 1990]. IDS (for Integrated Discovery System) takes an initial is-a hierarchy and a sequential list of histories (qualitative states, see [Hayes 1979][Forbus 1985]) and produces a fuller, richer hierarchy of classified history abstractions with associated state and transition laws. The system can learn taxonomic, qualitative and numeric relations and can make predictions. Unfortunately, IDS history hierarchy imposes a scientifically irrelevant bias on the type of knowledge that can be discovered. Operations are limited to local tree manipulations. This constrains search by limiting the number of applicable operators, however, it also limits the resulting knowledge to that obtainable by local comparison.
