Abstract: A basic premise of case-based reasoning (CBR) is that it involves reasoning from cases, which are representations of real episodes, rather than from rules, which are facts and if then structures with no stated connection to any real episodes. In fact, most CBR systems do not reason directly from cases | rather they reason from abstractions or simplifications of cases. In this paper, we argue for "pure" case-based reasoning, i.e., reasoning from representations that are both concrete and reasonably complete. We claim that working from representations that satisfy these criteria We illustrate our argument with examples from three previous systems, chef, swale, and hypo, as well as from cookie, a CBR system being developed by the first author.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the system could utilize parts of the episodic knowledge about Janis Joplin to come up with explanations of other facts, such as why she took recreational drugs; swale's use of XPs precludes this. 4 hypo: finding the cases, building the arguments In hypo <ref> [ Ashley, 1988 ] </ref> , the user presents a fact situation involving trade secrets issues, and the system comes up with a list of similar ("on point") cases and a legal argument based on these cases. It retrieves cases by indexing using a fixed set of indices (termed "dimensions").

Reference-contexts: Specifically, this representation allows cases to be used for multiple purposes | plan generation, plan recognition, explanation, and repair. 2 chef: keeping the broccoli crisp In chef <ref> [ Hammond, 1986 ] </ref> , the user specifies a dish using goals (for style, ingredients, spiciness, texture, etc.), and the system produces a recipe by modifying a recipe in its database.

Reference-contexts: is not the kind of thing that gets written in a cookbook, but a real cook (in a real kitchen) is typically well aware of the quirks and shortcomings of his or her equipment, and is able to adjust for these. 3 swale: explaining why they die young In swale <ref> [ Kass and Leake, 1988 ] </ref> , cases are used to explain anomalous events, such as the death of a young, vigorous athlete. Cases are structured as explanation patterns (XPs), which contain an anomalous situation, a set of premises (facts), and a set of causal links and intermediate facts.
