Title: Network Working Group Category: Standards Track Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Status of this memo This
Author: R. Droms 
Date: Obsoletes: 1531 October 1993  
Affiliation: Bucknell University  
Note: Request for Comments: 1541  of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Table of Contents  
Abstract: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network. DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [7], adding the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network addresses and additional configuration options [19]. DHCP captures the behavior of BOOTP relay agents [7, 23], and DHCP participants can interoperate with BOOTP participants [9]. Due to some errors introduced into RFC 1531 in the editorial process, this memo is reissued as RFC 1541.

Reference-contexts: Other client identifier types may be defined as needed for use with DHCP. New client identifier types will be registered with the IANA [18] and will be included in new revisions of the Assigned Numbers document, as well as described in detail in future revisions of the DHCP Options <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The options field may be further extended into the 'file' and 'sname' fields. Droms [Page 9] RFC 1541 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol October 1993 A new option, called 'vendor specific information', has been added to allow for expansion of the number of options that can be supported <ref> [2] </ref>. Options encapsulated as 'vendor specific information' must be carefully defined and documented so as to allow for interoperability between clients and servers from diferent vendors. <p> The remainder of the 'options' field consists a list of tagged parameters that are called "options". All of the "vendor extensions" listed in RFC 1497 are also DHCP options. A separate document gives the complete set of options defined for use with DHCP <ref> [2] </ref>. Several options have been defined so far. One particular option - the "DHCP message type" option - must be included in every DHCP message. This option defines the "type" of the DHCP message. Additional options may be allowed, required, or not allowed, depending on the DHCP message type. <p> If the options in a DHCP message extend into the 'sname' and 'file' fields, the 'option overload' option MUST appear in the 'options' field, with value 1, 2 or 3, as specified in the DHCP options document <ref> [2] </ref>. If the 'option overload' option is present in the 'options' field, the options in the 'options' field MUST be terminated by an 'end' option, and MAY contain one or more 'pad' options to fill the options field.

Reference-contexts: Comer and Droms have proposed the use of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as a transport protocol for resource location and selection [6]. Finally, the Host Requirements RFCs <ref> [3, 4] </ref> mention specific requirements for host reconfiguration and suggest a scenario for initial configuration of diskless hosts. 1.2 Problem definition and issues DHCP is designed to supply hosts with the configuration parameters defined in the Host Requirements RFCs. <p> The options field is now variable length, with the minimum extended to 312 octets. This brings the minimum size of a DHCP message up to 576 octets, the minimum IP datagram size a host must be prepared to accept <ref> [3] </ref>. DHCP clients may negotiate the use of larger DHCP messages through the 'Maximum DHCP message size' option. The options field may be further extended into the 'file' and 'sname' fields.

Reference-contexts: Droms [Page 3] RFC 1541 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol October 1993 1.1 Related Work There are several Internet protocols and related mechanisms that address some parts of the dynamic host configuration problem. The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) [10] (through the extensions defined in the Dynamic RARP (DRARP) <ref> [5] </ref>) explicitly addresses the problem of network address discovery, and includes an automatic IP address assignment mechanism. The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) [20] provides for transport of a boot image from a boot server.

Reference-contexts: In other related work, the path minimum transmission unit (MTU) discovery algorithm can determine the MTU of an arbitrary internet path [14].

Reference-contexts: The format of DHCP messages is based on the format of BOOTP messages, to capture the BOOTP relay agent behavior described as part of the BOOTP specification <ref> [7, 23] </ref> and to allow interoperability of existing BOOTP clients with DHCP servers. Using BOOTP relaying agents eliminates the necessity of having a DHCP server on each physical network segment.

Reference-contexts: ICMP also can provide subnet mask information through the "ICMP mask request" message and other information through the (obsolete) "ICMP information request" message. Hosts can locate routers through the ICMP router discovery mechanism <ref> [8] </ref>. BOOTP is a transport mechanism for a collection of configuration information. BOOTP is also extensible, and official extensions [17] have been defined for several configuration parameters. Morgan has proposed extensions to BOOTP for dynamic IP address assignment [15].

Reference-contexts: Protocol Summary From the client's point of view, DHCP is an extension of the BOOTP mechanism. This behavior allows existing BOOTP clients to interoperate with DHCP servers without requiring any change to the clients' initialization software. A separate document details the interactions between BOOTP and DHCP clients and servers <ref> [9] </ref>. There are some new, optional transactions that optimize the interaction between DHCP clients and servers that are described in sections 3 and 4. each of the fields in the DHCP message. The numbers in parentheses indicate the size of each field in octets.

Reference-contexts: In this document, the period over which a network address is allocated to a client is referred to as a "lease" <ref> [11] </ref>. The client may extend its lease with subsequent requests. The client may issue a message to release the address back to the server when the client no longer needs the address. The client may ask for a permanent assignment by asking for an infinite lease.
