Title: Computation in Noisy Radio Networks  
Author: Eyal Kushilevitz Yishay Mansour 
Abstract: In this paper we examine noisy radio (broadcast) networks in which every bit transmitted has a certain probability to be flipped. Each processor has some initial input bit, and the goal is to compute a function of the initial inputs. In this model we show a protocol to compute any threshold function using only a linear number of transmissions.

Reference-contexts: We consider random noise as described above. To simplify things, we ignore the topology of the network and study a fully connected network; this allows us to focus on the issue of efficiently overcoming the noise.

More formally, Gallager considers the following setting: there are n processors in the network P 1 ; : : : ; P n . <p> The question is what bounds can be proved in the noisy case. By the above arguments, O (n log n) broadcast operations suffice and (n) are necessary.

Reference-contexts: The reason behind this requirement is that if the schedule depends on previous transmissions then, since due to the noise different processors get different information, we can get into chaotic situations. 4 There are two widely-studied models of broadcast/radio networks (see, e.g., <ref> [Tan81] </ref> for a discussion including a technological justification for each of the models): (a) a model that allows a processor to remain silent in its turn; and (b) a model that does not allow a processor to remain silent in its turn.
