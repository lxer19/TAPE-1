Title: Bounds on the Chromatic Polynomial and on the Number of Acyclic Orientations of a Graph
Author: Nabil Kahale Leonard J. Schulman

Abstract: An upper bound is given on the number of acyclic orientations of a graph, in terms of the spectrum of its Laplacian. It is shown that this improves upon the previously known bound, which depended on the degree sequence of the graph. Estimates on the new bound are provided. A lower bound on the number of acyclic orientations of a graph is given, with the help of the probabilistic method. This argument can take advantage of structural properties of the graph: it is shown how to obtain stronger bounds for small-degree graphs of girth at least five, than are possible for arbitrary graphs. A simpler proof of the known lower bound for arbitrary graphs is also obtained.

Reference-contexts: At each vertex v select a random variable x v independently, uniformly in <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Let y u = x u + (w;u)2E (G) x w =2. <p> This is due to the fact that the hypercube has many cycles of length 4, which implies that tr (A l ) &gt; (l) for even l greater than or equal to 4. However, since the number of spanning trees of any connected d-regular graph on n vertices <ref> [1] </ref> is at least (d o (d)) n , the same lower bound holds on the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix of any d-regular graph on n vertices.

Reference-contexts: However, for large d, the girth assumption by itself will not yield a lower bound on the number of acyclic orientations substantially better than the one in subsection 4.2 (using the outdegrees approach). Indeed, it is easy to show (see, e.g., <ref> [2, page 122] </ref>) that, if the second 13 largest eigenvalue of a d-regular graph is much smaller than d, in every acyclic orientation of the graph the outdegrees will be essentially uniformly distributed between 0 and d.

Using a different approach, it can be shown <ref> [3] </ref> that the number of acyclic orientations of a d-regular complete bipartite graph is at least (d=(e ln 2) + O (ln d)) 2d , with e ln 2 = 1:88 : : :.

Reference-contexts: More generally [19, Exercise 4.32], the number of spanning forests with j edges is the coefficient of w j in the Ehrhart polynomial i (P; w). The inequality noted above can therefore be expressed as G (w) i (P; w). Recently, Annan <ref> [4] </ref> gave a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme for calculating the number of forests in a dense graph. 4.2 Lower Bound on G We begin by showing a new, simpler proof of the lower bound of [9] for the number of acyclic orientations in a graph.

Reference-contexts: It is known that the coefficient of w nj in G (w) is equal to the number of j-edge subgraphs which contain no "broken circuits"; the latter is a condition which, in particular, implies that the subgraphs are forests <ref> [5, page 69] </ref>. Hence for nonnegative w, all the terms of det (Q+wI) and G (w) are nonnegative, and each term in det (Q + wI) is at least as large as the corresponding term in G (w). Therefore we have the following extension of Theorem 1: Theorem 5.

Reference-contexts: An upper bound on the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix can be com puted directly for some graphs. For example, the determinant of the 15 Kirchhoff matrix of the d-dimensional hypercube <ref> [12] </ref> is at most (d + 1) 2 d 2d 1 4d 2 + O (d 3 ))). This bound beats the one given in Theorem 2. <p> For a d-regular graph, the lower bound provided by Lemma 3 never ex ceeds (d=2 + 1) n . This is because the average value of the outdegrees is d=2. By choosing a particular acyclic orientation of the d-dimensional hypercube, it can be shown <ref> [12] </ref> that the number of acyclic orientations of the d-dimensional hypercube is at least (d=2 + 3=4 + O (d 1 )) 2 d .

Reference-contexts: We then study the case of arbitrary graphs. The problem of estimating the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix is related to the problem of counting the number of spanning trees of d-regular graphs.

Reference-contexts: Since K (G) = (d + 1)I A, we have det (K (G)) = (d + 1) n f (1=(d + 1)). In order to get the desired bound on the determinant of K (G), we are going to bound f (1=(d + 1)). A classical result <ref> [19, pages 242-243] </ref> shows that f 0 (z) = z l1 From the definition we see that the radius of convergence of this generating function is the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of A in absolute value, which in this case is d. <p> Let P be the convex hull in R n of the vectors h (), where ranges over the acyclic orientations of G. The number of spanning forests of G is the number of integer points in P. More generally <ref> [19, Exercise 4.32] </ref>, the number of spanning forests with j edges is the coefficient of w j in the Ehrhart polynomial i (P; w). The inequality noted above can therefore be expressed as G (w) i (P; w).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Given an undirected graph G, the number of acyclic orientations of G, ff (G), is the number of ways in which all of its arcs can be directed without introducing directed cycles. The number of acyclic orientations was first considered by Stanley <ref> [20] </ref> in 1973, who pointed out a remarkable characterization of this number as the value at 1 of the chromatic polynomial G of the graph. <p> Our proof relies upon the following: Lemma 4. For all w 0, G (w) (d v + w) Gv (w). Proof: For any edge e in G, G satisfies the contraction-deletion identity <ref> [20] </ref> G = G=e + Ge : (5) If e 1 ; :::; e d v are the edges incident to vertex v, then we can expand this identity to obtain G = G=e 1 + (Ge 1 )=e 2 + (Ge 1 e 2 )=e 3 + + (Ge 1
