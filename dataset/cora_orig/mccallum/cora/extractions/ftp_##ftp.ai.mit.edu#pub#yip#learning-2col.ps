Abstract: Humans rapidly and reliably learn many kinds of regularities and generalizations. We propose a novel model of fast learning that exploits the properties of sparse representations and the constraints imposed by a plausible hardware mechanism. To demonstrate our approach we describe a computational model of acquisition in the domain of morphophonology. We encapsulate phonological information as bidirectional boolean constraint relations operating on the classical linguistic representations of speech sounds in term of distinctive features. The performance model is described as a hardware mechanism that incrementally enforces the constraints. Phonological behavior arises from the action of this mechanism. Constraints are induced from a corpus of common English nouns and verbs. The induction algorithm compiles the corpus into increasingly sophisticated constraints. The algorithm yields one-shot learning from a few examples. Our model has been implemented as a computer program. The program exhibits phonological behavior similar to that of young children. As a bonus the constraints that are acquired can be interpreted as classical linguistic rules.

Reference-contexts: However, this time the generalizations are consistent: there are not any new exceptions or near misses. Note that after seeing only 4 positive examples, the learner is able to acquire constraints on the plural formation that closely resemble those found in linguistics texts <ref> (Akmajian, Demers, & Harnish 1990) </ref>. These rule-classifiers are now available for constraint propagation, and are subject to further refinement when new examples appear. Experimental Results The corpus consists of 250 words. 10 The words are common nouns (about 50) and verbs (about 200) that first-graders might know. <p> The two new higher-order rule-classifier enforce the constraint that the voicing bits of the ending phoneme of the stem and the affix must match: [dc.dc.[-voice].[-voice]] [dc.dc.[+voice].[+voice]] These rule-classifiers can be interpreted as the voicing assimilation rule described in linguistics texts (such as <ref> (Akmajian, Demers, & Harnish 1990) </ref>). Voicing assimilation captures cross-categorical generalizations governing the formation of not only plural nouns and past-tense verbs, but also third-person singular verbs, possessive nouns, and several other morphological categories. Linguists explain complicated phonological processes in terms of the interactions of nearly independent and widely applicable rules.

Reference-contexts: Thus learning language must be easy, but we do not have effective theories that explain the phenomenon. The mystery deepens when we notice that children learn many new words without ever hearing them. In a classic experiment by Berko <ref> (Berko 1958) </ref>, a number of English-speaking children were shown representations of a fanciful being called a "wug." When asked to say something about a situation with more than one of these beings, the children correctly pluralized the novel word to make "wugz" (not "wugs"). <p> The phoneme bits of the classifiers are as follows: 1. [dc.dc.[+voice,-strident].z] 2. [dc.dc.-y,e,I,v-.z] 3. [dc.dc.[-voice,-strident].s] 4. [dc.dc.[-voice,-coronal].s] 5. [dc.[+coronal,+strident].I.z] Notice that we can almost read off the standard English pluralization rules from these classifiers. The learner also exhibits intermediate behaviors similar to those of young children <ref> (Berko 1958) </ref>. After rule-classifier 1 and rule-classifier 3 are acquired, the performance program produces plurals like *foot [s] and *man [z]. Upon presentation of the nonce word "wug," it gives wug [z].

Reference-contexts: These claims are contrary to those made by the statistical learning theories. We do not attack the problem of how an acoustic waveform is processed. We start with an abstraction from linguistics (as developed by Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Morris Halle, and Noam Chomsky) <ref> (Chomsky & Halle 1968) </ref>: Speech sounds (phonemes) are not atomic but are encoded as combinations of more primitive structures, called distinctive features.

Reference-contexts: But there is evidence that the statistical property may not be essential to the acquisition of regular rules. For example, Marcus et. al. (Marcus et al. 1992) and Clahsen <ref> (Clahsen, Rothweiler, & Woest 1992) </ref> showed that the German -s plural behaves like a regular rule despite the fact that the rule applies to fewer than 30 common nouns. This observation raises the question of how a child can acquire regular rules from very few examples.

Reference-contexts: In another experiment <ref> (Marcus et al. 1992) </ref>, Marcus et. al. 2 See (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986; Pinker & Prince 1988; Pinker 1991; Prasada & Pinker 1992; Ling & Marinov 1993). showed that young children who first use an irregular verb properly (such as "came") would later err on the same verb (by supplementing "came" <p> The nouns are the singular and plural forms of common animals and everyday objects. (e.g., cat, cats, dog, dogs, cup, cups, nose, noses, man, men) The corpus includes most of the regular and irregular verbs used in the psycholinguistic experiments of Marcus et. al. <ref> (Marcus et al. 1992) </ref> on English tenses. Consistent with the observation that a human learner receives little explicit correction, the corpus contains only positive examples. However, the lack of external negative evidence does not rule out the possibility that the learner can generate internal negative examples when testing hypotheses. <p> But there is evidence that the statistical property may not be essential to the acquisition of regular rules. For example, Marcus et. al. <ref> (Marcus et al. 1992) </ref> and Clahsen (Clahsen, Rothweiler, & Woest 1992) showed that the German -s plural behaves like a regular rule despite the fact that the rule applies to fewer than 30 common nouns.
