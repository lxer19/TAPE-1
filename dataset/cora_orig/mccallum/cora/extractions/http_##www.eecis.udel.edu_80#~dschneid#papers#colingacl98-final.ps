Abstract: This paper reports on the recognition component of an intelligent tutoring system that is designed to help foreign language speakers learn standard English. The system models the grammar of the learner, with this instantiation of the system tailored to signers of American Sign Language (ASL). We discuss the theoretical motivations for the system, various difficulties that have been encountered in the implementation, as well as the methods we have used to overcome these problems. Our method of capturing ungrammaticalities involves using mal-rules (also called 'error productions'). However, the straightforward addition of some mal-rules causes significant performance problems with the parser. For instance, the ASL population has a strong tendency to drop pronouns and the auxiliary verb `to be'. Being able to account for these as sentences results in an explosion in the number of possible parses for each sentence. This explosion, left unchecked, greatly hampers the performance of the system. We discuss how this is handled by taking into account expectations from the specific population (some of which are captured in our unique user model). The different representations of lexical items at various points in the acquisition process are modeled by using mal-rules, which obviates the need for multiple lexicons. The grammar is evaluated on its ability to correctly diagnose agreement problems in actual sentences produced by ASL native speakers.

Reference-contexts: The essence of the acquisition model is that there are discrete stages that all learners of a particular language will go through (Krashen, 1981), (Ingram, 1989), (Dulay and Burt, 1974), <ref> (Bailey et al., 1974) </ref>. Each of these stages is characterized in our model by sets of language features (and therefore constructions) that the learner is in the process of acquiring.

Reference-contexts: These rules will be the ones the parser attempts to use when parsing the user's input. Thus we take an interlanguage view of the acquisition process <ref> (Selinker, 1972) </ref>, (Ellis, 1994), (Cook, 1993) and attempt to model how the student's grammar is likely to change over time.

Reference-contexts: In this instantiation fl This work was supported by NSF Grant #SRS9416916. of the system, we are focusing on the particular problems of American Sign Language (ASL) native signers. The system recognizes errors by using mal-rules (also called 'error-production rules') <ref> (Sleeman, 1982) </ref>, (Weischedel et al., 1978) which extend the language accepted by the grammar to include sentences containing the specified errors. The mal-rules themselves are derived from an error taxonomy which was the result of an analysis of writing samples.
