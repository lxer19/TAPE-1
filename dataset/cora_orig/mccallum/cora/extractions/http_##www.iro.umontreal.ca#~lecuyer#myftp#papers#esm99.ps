Abstract: Lattice rules are a quasi-Monte Carlo method, an alternative to the Monte Carlo method for multidimensional numerical integration. The measures of performance that we estimate by simulation can be seen as the values of integrals in large dimensions. Therefore, instead of the usual Monte Carlo method, one can use lattice rules in simulation. In this paper, we compare these rules to the Monte Carlo method to simulate the surplus process of an insurance company, in order to estimate the ruin probability. We give results using different simulation techniques and also try different parameters, in order to see how this affects the relative performance of these two methods.

Reference-contexts: Typically, (u) is very small: The ruin is a rare-event. Therefore, using the straightforward approach of simulating the claims arrival process until ruin occurs might be very inefficient. This is a situation where importance sampling (IS) should be used: <ref> [1] </ref> explains how the probability laws should be modified in the case where ffi = 0. In the particular case of exponential claims size, the optimal change of measure is known. <p> Again, LR reduces the variance compared to MC (by a factor of about 2.5). When ffi = 0, IS is known to give more precise estimators than the regenerative method <ref> [1] </ref>. However, when ffi &gt; 0, IS is more difficult to apply, whereas the regenerative method works fine for all ffi.

Reference-contexts: We can then write <ref> [2] </ref>: (u) = 1 lim D n (u) i=1 T i where D n (u) is the total time spent by X () under level u before its n th jump and T i is the time between the (i 1) th jump and the i th jump of X ().

Reference-contexts: In the particular case of exponential claims size, the optimal change of measure is known. When ffi &gt; 0, the problem is much harder, because we must locally change the distributional parameters during the simulation: see <ref> [3] </ref> for more details on this.

Reference-contexts: However, for fixed N , as s increases, MC may eventually get better than QMC. But numerical experiments that have been carried out for option valuation problems in finance seem to indicate that the advantage of QMC holds for large dimensions as well <ref> [15, 11, 4] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we explain briefly how to construct lattice rules, which is the QMC method that we use here.

Reference-contexts: One way to do this is to generate m i.i.d. vectors 1 ; : : : ; m , uniformly and randomly on [0; 1) s , and use them to shift P , modulo 1. This is the Cranley-Patterson randomization technique <ref> [5] </ref>, which we use in this paper. 3.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we compare MC and a QMC method to estimate the ruin probability for an insurance company, a well-known problem in risk theory. We investigate how the parameters of the model and the simulation techniques <ref> [9, 6] </ref> used in combination with each of these two methods affect their relative performance, which is measured by the estimated variance associated with each of these methods. MC and QMC methods are usually the most appropriate to estimate (1). <p> When the generating vector is of the form h = (1; a; : : : ; a s1 ), P is equal to the set of all successive overlapping s-tuples produced by a linear congruential generator (LCG) with modulo N and multiplier a, from all possible initial seeds <ref> [7, 13, 6, 14] </ref>. Thus, if the LCG has maximal period, the points in P may be generated quickly by just running the LCG over its full period, taking the successive s-tuples, and adding the origin.

Thus, if the LCG has maximal period, the points in P may be generated quickly by just running the LCG over its full period, taking the successive s-tuples, and adding the origin. <p> The properties of the lattice allow the derivation of a convenient formula for P ff , that can be calculated in O (Ns) time. One can also use the connection with LCGs to derive a selection criterion for P . For example, as suggested in <ref> [7] </ref>, one might think of using the spectral test, a well-known selection criterion for LCGs, that can be calculated efficiently. <p> For these reasons, we adopt this approach to choose the rank-1 rules used in the numerical experiments of this paper. The reference giving tables of such "best LCGs" is [10]. For more on selection criteria, see <ref> [8, 7] </ref> for example. The bound (2) is of little practical use to give an idea of the integration error. Therefore, one needs another way to estimate the error. For QMC methods, the usual way is to randomize the point set P , without destroying its regularity properties.

With the estimator (3), it is equal to 2l, but the effective dimension <ref> [15, 8] </ref> is in some sense smaller than that, since the interactions that contribute the most to the variance are the ones among variables related to the same cycle.
