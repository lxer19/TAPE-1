Abstract: We are given a connected, undirected graph G on n vertices. There is a mobile robot on one of the vertices; this vertex is labeled s. Each of several other vertices contains a single movable obstacle. The robot and the obstacles may only reside at vertices, although they may be moved across edges. A vertex may never contain more than one object (robot/obstacle). In one step, we may move either the robot or one of the obstacles from its current position v to a vacant vertex adjacent to v. Our goal is to move the robot to a designated vertex t using the smallest number of steps possible. The problem is a simple abstraction of a robot motion planning problem, with the geometry replaced by the adjacencies in the graph. We point out its connections to robot motion planning. We study its complexity, giving exact and approximate algorithms for several cases.

Reference-contexts: A number of related geometric motion planning problems are given in [8]. It is possible to formulate graph-theoretic analogs of all of these problems, and this is discussed in Section 4. We note that Frederickson (see <ref> [1] </ref> and references therein) has studied a different planning problem that he calls motion planning on a tree; our problem and methods are completely different from his. An obvious generalization of GMP1R is GMPkR, where we have k robots with respective destinations.

Reference-contexts: Kornhauser, Miller, and Spirakis [5] extend his result to any k n 1 and also give an upper bound of O (n 3 ) on the number of steps to solve any solvable instance. They give an example showing that this bound is the best possible. Goldreich <ref> [2] </ref> has studied the complexity of determining the shortest move sequence for the GMPkR problem and shown that this is NP-hard in the case k = n 1.

Reference-contexts: Packet routing using the deflection or hot-potato model <ref> [3] </ref> provides a related example (see Section 4). In some of these cases, a better cost metric may account for the physical lengths of edges. In others, intersections in the building/railroad may be able to hold more than one obstacle/robot at a time. <p> This version is closely related to deflection routing for packets <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, we would study plans with parallel moves allowed, and study the number of steps to deliver every robot to its destination.

Reference-contexts: This models situations in which we have intersections at which objects can move past one another (say, a railway junction). We conclude by mentioning the most interesting directions for further research: (1) Show that a simple geometric version of GMP1R is PSPACE-hard. The related warehouseman's problem is PSPACE-hard <ref> [4] </ref>; however, that reduction breaks down if all the objects have the same size. (2) Study the case of several robots, each with its own destination; this is the GMPkR problem discussed in Section 1. (3) In situations such as railway networks, several objects can move simultaneously under their own power.

Reference-contexts: Wilson [9] studies the case k = n 1, which is the "15-puzzle" played on a general graph, and gives an efficiently checkable characterization of the solvable instances of the problem. Kornhauser, Miller, and Spirakis <ref> [5] </ref> extend his result to any k n 1 and also give an upper bound of O (n 3 ) on the number of steps to solve any solvable instance. They give an example showing that this bound is the best possible.

Reference-contexts: They give an example showing that this bound is the best possible. Goldreich [2] has studied the complexity of determining the shortest move sequence for the GMPkR problem and shown that this is NP-hard in the case k = n 1. Ratner and Warmuth <ref> [7] </ref> show that this is the case even if the graph is restricted to be a n fi n grid (the case of interest in the generalized 15-puzzle).

Reference-contexts: In fact, the characterization and algorithms we give will implicitly solve in polynomial time the decision version, which asks whether at all the robot can be moved from s to t. A number of related geometric motion planning problems are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. It is possible to formulate graph-theoretic analogs of all of these problems, and this is discussed in Section 4.
