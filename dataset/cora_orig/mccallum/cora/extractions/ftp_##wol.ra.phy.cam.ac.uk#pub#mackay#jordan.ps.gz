Abstract: Several authors have made a link between hidden Markov models for time series and energy-based models (Luttrell 1989, Williams 1990, Saul and Jordan 1995). Saul and Jordan (1995) discuss a linear Boltzmann chain model with state-state transition energies A ii 0 (going from state i to state i 0 ) and symbol emission energies B ij , under which the probability of an entire state fi l ; j l g L Whilst any HMM can be written as a linear Boltzmann chain by setting exp(A ii 0 ) = a ii 0 , exp(B ij ) = b ij and exp( i ) = i , not all linear Boltzmann chains can be represented as HMMs (Saul and Jordan 1995). However, the difference between the two models is minimal. To be precise, if the final hidden state i L of a linear Boltzmann chain is constrained to be a particular end state, then the distribution over sequences is identical to that of a hidden Markov model.
