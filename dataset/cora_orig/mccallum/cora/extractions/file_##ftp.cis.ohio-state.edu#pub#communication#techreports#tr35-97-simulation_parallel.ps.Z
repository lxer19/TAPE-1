Reference-contexts: Many routing algorithms have been proposed for this. A routing algorithm provides the next link that a worm should take, given the worm header and the link on which the worm arrives at a router as input. Various routing algorithms have been proposed in the recent years <ref> (Duato et al., 1997) </ref> and WORMulSim supports a number of them (such as Dally's e-cube, Glass and Ni's turn model, Chien and Kim's planar adaptive, Duato's fully adaptive, and Autonet's up*/down* routing algorithms).

Reference-contexts: The time delays for these operations are determined by WORMulSim in a dynamic and integrated manner during execution, as described in earlier sections. The computation time of each application is estimated as follows. We first compile the source code of each application by the DLXcc compiler <ref> (Hennessy, 1996) </ref> using the optimization level equivalent to O2 of gcc. Next, we examine the generated object code instruction by instruction on each processor and instrument the program (by inserting instructions in each basic block of the code) to count the instructions executed between two successive communication operations.
