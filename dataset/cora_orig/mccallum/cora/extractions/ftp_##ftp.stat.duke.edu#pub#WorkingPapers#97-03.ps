Abstract: New approaches to prior specification and structuring in autoregressive time series models are introduced and developed. We focus on defining classes of prior distributions for parameters and latent variables related to latent components of an autoregressive model for an observed time series. These new priors naturally permit the incorporation of both qualitative and quantitative prior information about the number and relative importance of physically meaningful components that represent low frequency trends, quasi-periodic sub-processes, and high frequency residual noise components of observed series. The class of priors also naturally incorporates uncertainty about model order, and hence leads in posterior analysis to model order assessment and resulting posterior and predictive inferences that incorporate full uncertainties about model order as well as model parameters. Analysis also formally incorporates uncertainty, and leads to inferences about, unknown initial values of the time series, as it does for predictions of future values. Posterior analysis involves easily implemented iterative simulation methods, developed and described here. One motivating applied field is climatology, where the evaluation of latent structure, especially quasi-periodic structure, is of critical importance in connection with issues of global climatic variability. We explore analysis of data from the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), one of several series that has been central in recent high-profile debates in the atmospheric sciences about recent apparent trends in climatic indicators.

Reference-contexts: Hence the component reference prior is attractive from this empirical and modelling viewpoint, as well as having the theoretical reference prior justification. 4 Posterior Structure and Analysis Under the prior structure just described, posterior and predictive calculations are available via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods <ref> (e.g., Gilks et al 1996) </ref>. The structure of relevant conditional posterior distributions is briefly outlined here, with some commentary on details of our chosen MCMC methods. Further details appear in the Appendix. First some notation.

Reference-contexts: Success with vector autoregressions is testament to the utility of strategies based on this view, and the successful use of high-order models is enabled through the use of structured smoothness priors <ref> (Litterman 1986a,b) </ref>. Often, however, underlying time series structure may be adequately captured by more parsimonious models and then high-order autoregressions imply immediate over-fitting and approximations, but within such structure the underlying and physically meaningful patterns will emerge.

Reference-contexts: Appendix A.3 provides discussion and proof of this general and important result. Finally, note that the model structure and MCMC strategy outlined are such that the resulting Markov chain is trivially seen to be aperiodic and irreducible, and so standard theory <ref> (e.g., Tierney 1994) </ref> guarantees convergence of resulting MCMC sequences. Our experience with these models in ranges of applications indicates that convergence is generally clean and rapid. Note that we run the MCMC analysis on the unidentified component parameters, and that components are identified by appropriately labelling the posterior sampled values.
