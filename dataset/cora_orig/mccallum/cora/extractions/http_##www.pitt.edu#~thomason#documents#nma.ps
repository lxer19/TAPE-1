Note: Effects as infallible consequences of action With almost no exceptions, the theories of action that have been proposed by philosophers, logicians, and (most recently) by researchers in Artificial Intelligence  is fairly extensive: see, for instance, (Care Landes-man 1968; Goldman 1970; Hornsby 1980). The relation of actions to their effects is formulated most clearly in the more specialized literature on the logic of action; see (Belnap Perloff  in all the possible histories in which the action is performed. I.e., in all these histories, the agent must be home by tomorrow. The assumption of these theories, then, is that the  the conclusion that the action-effect relation is one of causal necessity will follow as soon as it is granted that  as to seem axiomatic. 1

Reference-contexts: There have been later attempts to use nonmonotonic logic to improve on Dowty's theory; see <ref> (Asher 1992) </ref>. The theory that I will develop below is close in many ways to this linguistic work. 3. The ultimate purpose of a planning formalism is to relate goals to sequences of performable actions that will achieve these goals.

Reference-contexts: giving the effects of stacking one block on another. (1) [Holds (Clear (x); s) ^ Holds (Clear (y); s)] ! Holds (On (x; y); result (stack (x; y); s)) There is no explicit operator for historical necessity in these formalisms, as there is in logics of action like that of <ref> (Belnap & Perloff 1988) </ref>. Nevertheless, the necessity of the relation between actions and their effects can be seen at the metalinguisic level. In every model in which an action occurs, its effect must also occur.

Reference-contexts: It is fairly usual, in formalizing the interpretation and generation of discourse, to think of speech acts as planning operators; the idea goes back at least as far as <ref> (Cohen & Perrault 1979) </ref>. But the goals of many typical speech acts are to some extent cooperative. This is true especially of speech acts that form half of a pair, actions like questions and proposals.

Reference-contexts: The dominance argument for not working has the same form as the preceding argument for going to the office, but it is invalid because whether I am wealthy or poor is not independent of whether I work hand. In <ref> (Thomason & Horty 1997) </ref>, a model theory is developed that provides for dominance reasoning about actions whose outcomes are uncertain. We use branching time models. At each moment of time, there is a global state. There are many agents, who can perform actions. <p> These notions can be extended to sequences of actions. The main result of <ref> (Thomason & Horty 1997) </ref> is the soundness of this notion of dominance with respect to quantitative dominance in causal decision theory, (Gibbard & Harper 1978). The result shows that the dominance reasoning characterized in the qualitative theory is in some sense correct. <p> Intuitively, it seems that common sense dominance arguments depend not only on independence considerations, but on ignoring risks that in some sense can considered to be negligable. Making the connection between actions and their normal effects defeasible provides a way to achieve this, while maintaining the qualitative spirit of <ref> (Thomason & Horty 1997) </ref>. We extend the action model by adding a preference relation over transitions; crudely, some transitions are normal and others are not. The idea, of course, is that transitions in which actions do not achieve their conventional effects are abnormal. We redefine dominance by ignoring abnormal transitions. <p> The main technical result of (Thomason 1998) extends the soundness result of <ref> (Thomason & Horty 1997) </ref> to a version of causal decision theory with nonstandard probabilities, in which abnormal transitions get infinitesimal probability.
