Abstract: Approximability and Nonapproximability Results for Abstract We consider the problem of scheduling n jobs that are released over time on a single machine in order to minimize the total flow time. This problem is well-known to be NP-complete, and the best polynomial time approximation algorithms constructed so far had (more or less trivial) worst-case performance guarantees of O(n). In this paper, we present one positive and one negative result on polynomial time approximations for the minimum total flow time problem: The positive result is the first approximation algorithm with a sublinear worst-case performance guarantee of O( n). This algorithm is based on resolving the preemptions of the corresponding optimum preemptive schedule. The performance guarantee of our approximation algorithm is not far from best possible as our second, negative, result demonstrates: Unless P = N P , no polynomial time approximation algorithm for minimum total flow time can have a worst-case performance guarantee of O(n p

Reference-contexts: 12 (2) Our lower bound argument carries over to the problem P mjr i j P F i with parallel machines, but our algorithm breaks down for this case: For m 2 machines the preemptive problem P mjpmtn; r i j P F i is NP-complete (Du, Leung and Young <ref> [9] </ref>) and so the algorithm does not have the optimum preemptive schedule as a starting point. (3) Another open problem is designing approximation algorithms for the total weighted flow time problem on a single machine.
