Abstract: A mobile ad hoc network consists of wireless hosts that may move often. Movement of hosts results in a change in routes, requiring some mechanism for determining new routes. Several routing protocols have already been proposed for ad hoc networks. This paper suggests an approach to utilize location information (for instance, obtained using the global positioning system) to improve performance of routing protocols for ad hoc networks. By using location information, the proposed Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols limit the search for a new route to a smaller request zone of the ad hoc network. This results in a significant reduction in the number of routing messages. We present two algorithms to determine the request zone, and also suggest potential optimizations to our algorithms.

In this case, our algorithm reduces to the basic flooding algorithm. In general, having more information regarding mobility of a destination node, can result in a smaller expected zone.

Reference-contexts: The existing MANET routing algorithms do not take into account the physical location of a destination node. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to reduce route discovery overhead using location information. Similar ideas have been applied to develop selective paging for cellular PCS (Personal Communication Service) networks <ref> [4] </ref>. In selective paging, the system pages a selected subset of cells close to the last reported location of a mobile host. This allows the location tracking cost to be decreased. We propose and evaluate an analogous approach for routing in MANET.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Mobile ad hoc networks consist of wireless mobile hosts that communicate with each other, in the absence of a fixed infrastructure. 1 Routes between two hosts in a Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) may consist of hops through other hosts in the network <ref> [7] </ref>. Host mobility can cause frequent unpredictable topology changes. Therefore, the task of finding and maintaining routes in MANET is nontrivial. Many protocols have been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks, with the goal of achieving efficient routing [6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 28]. <p> search space results in fewer route discovery messages. fl Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program grants 010115-248 and 009741-052-C. 1 We will use the terms host and node interchangeably. 2 Related Work Design of routing protocols is a crucial problem in mobile ad hoc networks <ref> [7, 25] </ref>, and several routing algorithms have been developed (e.g., [6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 28]). One desirable qualitative property of a routing protocol is that it should adapt to the traffic patterns [8].

We demonstrate how location information may be used by means of two Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols for route discovery. The LAR protocols use location information (which may be out of date, by the time it is used) to reduce the search space for a desired route. <p> Thus, a packet is forwarded one hop closer to its final destination by comparing the location of packet's destination with the location of the node currently holding the packet. In a survey of potential applications of GPS, Dommety and Jain <ref> [10] </ref> briefly suggest use of location information in ad hoc networks, though they do not elaborate on how the information may be used. Other researchers have also suggested that location information should be used to improve (qualitatively or quantitatively) performance of a mobile computing system [27, 29]. <p> Location information used in the LAR protocol may be provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) <ref> [2, 3, 10, 22] </ref>.
