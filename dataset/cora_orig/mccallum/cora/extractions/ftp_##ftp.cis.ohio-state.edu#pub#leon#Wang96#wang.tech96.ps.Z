Abstract: 1 Technical Report: OSU-CISRC-12/96 - TR67, 1996 Abstract One of the classical topics in neural networks is winner-take-all (WTA), which has been widely used in unsupervised (competitive) learning, cortical processing, and attentional control. Because of global connectivity, WTA networks, however, do not encode spatial relations in the input, and thus cannot support sensory and perceptual processing where spatial relations are important. We propose a new architecture that maintains spatial relations between input features. This selection network builds on LEGION (Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Networks) dynamics and slow inhibition. In an input scene with many objects (patterns), the network selects the largest object. This system can be easily adjusted to select several largest objects, which then alternate in time. We further show that a twostage selection network gains efficiency by combining selection with parallel removal of noisy regions. The network is applied to select the most salient object in real images. As a special case, the selection network without local excitation gives rise to a new form of oscillatory WTA.

Reference-contexts: The candidates in WTA competition are single neurons, corresponding to local representations. On the other hand, the perceptual environment consists of patterned stimuli, which correspond to object structures, and objects seem to be the basic units of perception. Experimental data suggest that objects act as wholes in neural competition <ref> (Desimore and Duncan 1995) </ref>. Unless one adopts the view of local representations, whereby objects are represented by individual neurons (the grandmother-cell representation), existing WTA networks are limited in addressing sensory and perceptual information processing.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Linsay and Wang calculated the times that a block spends on RB and LB in the singular limit e fi 0 <ref> (Linsay and Wang 1996) </ref>. In particular, the time on LB is t L = ln ((I T + 4)/I), where I T = I + W T W z . According to (5), z s decays to s M exp (-m t L ). <p> The scene is mapped to the network as shown in Fig. 3B. In this simulation, N (i) contains four nearest neighbors with no boundary wraparound. For a stimulated oscillator, I = 0.2; otherwise, I = -0.02. The equations (1)-(5) were solved using the singular limit method <ref> (Linsay and Wang 1996) </ref>, which is a fast numerical method for integrating relaxation oscillator networks in the singular limit e fi 0.

Reference-contexts: Although these models exhibit selection due to WTA, they do not capture object-level selection required in selective attention because WTA provides only a winning pixel (or location), not a winning object. Also, it has been argued that selection mechanisms are indispensable for complex visual computations such as image analysis <ref> (Tsotsos 1995) </ref>. Here again, selection must be at the object level in order to aid image analysis.

In the following implementation connection weights to an oscillator are assumed to be normalized according to the mechanism of dynamic normalization <ref> (Wang 1995) </ref>. Dynamic normalization ensures that the weights of all connections to any stimulated oscillator quickly settle to a constant, W T . Wang and Terman (in press) provided differential equations to realize such normalization. <p> Wang and Terman (in press) provided differential equations to realize such normalization.
