Title: Learning Correlations between Linguistic Indicators and Semantic Constraints: Reuse of Context-Dependent Descriptions of Entities

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a study on the semantic constraints imposed on lexical choice by certain contextual indicators. We show how such indicators are computed and how correlations between them and the choice of a noun phrase description of a named entity can be automatically established using supervised learning. Based on this correlation, we have developed a technique for automatic lexical choice of descriptions of entities in text generation. We discuss the underlying relationship between the pragmatics of choosing an appropriate description that serves a specific purpose in the automatically generated text and the semantics of the description itself. We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of linguistic structures that are automatically extracted from large corpora. We present a formal evaluation of our approach and we conclude with some thoughts on potential applications of our method.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the semantic constraints specify that the description has to include the country and the political position of Ung Huot, the most appropriate description is "Cambodian foreign minister". 4 Experimental Setup In our experiments, we have used two widely available tools - WordNet and Ripper. WordNet <ref> (Miller et al., 1990) </ref> is an on-line hierarchical lexical database which contains semantic information about English words (including hypernymy relations which we use in our system).

Reference-contexts: A writer is likely to select a description that puts the entity in the context of the rest of the article. It is known that the distribution of words in a document is related to its topic <ref> (Salton and McGill, 1983) </ref>. We have developed related techniques for approximating pragmatic constraints using words that appear in the immediate context of the entity. We will show that context influences the choice of a description, as do several other linguistic indicators.
