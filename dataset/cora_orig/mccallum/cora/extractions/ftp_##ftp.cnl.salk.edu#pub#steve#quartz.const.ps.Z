Reference-contexts: In recent years, Chomsky's nativist view has been championed by evolutionary psychologists <ref> (e.g., Barkow et al. 1992) </ref>. Spurred on by the view of development as an intrinsic process, they have sought a phylogenetic source for the intrinsically specified skills comprising the human cognitive repertoire.

Reference-contexts: In the context of establishing consistency results, the important element of this growth is that it occurs at a rate that reduces variance. Encouraging bounds on the rate of convergence have recently been obtained <ref> (Barron 1994) </ref>. Moving from these results to complexity-based ones, it has been demonstrated that constructivist networks possess significantly more powerful learning properties than fixed networks. Indeed, Judd's (1988) demonstration that fixed networks are NP-complete has been extended to architectures of just three nodes (Blum & Rivest 1988).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the kitten's brain at birth is only 10% of its mature weight. Depending on cortical layer, total dendritic length for cells in human primary visual cortex at birth are between 30 and 50% of adult values <ref> (Becker et al. 1984) </ref>. For these layer V pyramidal cells adult values are reached by around four months compared to 18 months for layer III cells. What is striking about human cortical development, however, is the protractedness of nonvisual cortical development.

Reference-contexts: the probability of a learner searching through a fixed hypothesis space to successfully learn a concept chosen at random is exponentially small (reviewed in Dietterich 1990) is because 29 successful learning in this paradigm demands that the hypothesis space the learner considers be an exponentially small subset of possible concepts <ref> (see Blumer et al. 1988) </ref>. Hence, the failure to learn really may just indicate that the learner has chosen the wrong hypothesis space rather than reveal anything significant about the learnability of some target concept.

Reference-contexts: If concurrent synaptogenesis does not seem to hold as a general property, then how has the claim of initial synaptic overproduction followed by selective elimination held up? A recent study by Rakic and colleagues <ref> (Bourgeois et al. 1994) </ref> on synaptic development in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys has forced a reinterpretation of this model. Specifically, with a larger sample they did not find an early synaptic overproduction followed immediately by elimination, as in their earlier studies.

Reference-contexts: This striking view of language acquisition underlying the now general view of the mind as a collection of innately specified, specialized modules (e.g., Fodor 1983; Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994), while also based on numerous empirical studies of the nature of linguistic input <ref> (e.g., Brown 1973) </ref>, would not be so compelling were it not for the widely-held assumption that it is also based on rigorous results in formal learning theory (FLT). According to FLT, development is essentially a learning problem and so is constrained by the learning-theoretic pressures that confront any learner.

Reference-contexts: This would have the effect of putting more presynaptic structure into a local region in an activity-dependent manner, thereby essentially increasing the probability of subsequent synapse formation in that region. The outgrowth of axonal projections, such as the development of horizontal connections <ref> (Callaway and Katz 1991) </ref> suggest that the elaboration of axon terminals at this fine level may proceed according to this manner 23 Computation is always done in the context of neighboring information.

Reference-contexts: For example, studies of structural plasticity following learning typically subscribe to the ``more is better" doctrine (e.g., Turner & Greenough 1985). In development, a number of studies have quantitatively examined changes in synaptic numbers, despite the technical difficulties such studies present, both in obtaining unbiased counts <ref> (rev. in Coggeshall 1992) </ref> and in the amount of labor demanded by the techniques involved, such as serial reconstruction in electron microscopy (Huttenlocher et al. 1982; O'Kusky and Collonnier 6 1982a; 1982b; Rakic et al. 1986; Huttenlocher & de Courten 1987; Bourgeois et al. 1989; Zecevic & Rakic 1991).

Reference-contexts: Although the notion of specialized circuits is sometimes viewed from within a selectionist framework (e.g. Gazzaniga 1992) the selectionist model is strictly incompatible with the claim that specialized circuits have been selected by evolutionary pressures. The primary reason for this is that according to selectionism <ref> (e.g., Edelman, 1987) </ref> selective pressures operate on epigenetic variation during the ontogeny of the individual (in ``somatic'' time), not on a phylogenetic timescale.

Reference-contexts: Hence, depending on the pattern of incorporation of a radiolabelled tracer, it is possible that the non-deprived arbor took up more tracer and, because of the relatively low resolution of autoradiography, obscured deprived arbors <ref> (see Friedlander et al. 1991, p.3285) </ref>. 2.5 Conclusions The inadequacy of synaptic numbers to accurately measure circuit complexity has shifted the emphasis to the geometrical arrangement of pre and postsynaptic elements.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that the view of human cognitive evolution as the progressive increase in specialized cortical structures reflects a basic misinterpretation of cortical evolution. In contrast, we suggest that the hallmark of cortical evolution is not the ever-increasing sophistication of dedicated or specialized cortical circuitry <ref> (Gazzaniga 1995) </ref>; rather, it is marked by an increasing representational flexibility that allows environmental factors to fundamentally shape the structure and function of the human brain.

Reference-contexts: Currently, it is popular to regard not only cognitive skills but also social and political attitudes as the expression of genetically encoded responses to phylogenetic pressures acting over the course of evolutionary history. Although the notion of specialized circuits is sometimes viewed from within a selectionist framework <ref> (e.g. Gazzaniga 1992) </ref> the selectionist model is strictly incompatible with the claim that specialized circuits have been selected by evolutionary pressures.

Reference-contexts: That is, from the perspective of the PAC model of learning, the fundamental problems of learning are not those involving statistical inference, but center around how to find appropriate representations to underlie efficient learning <ref> (reviewed in Geman et al. 1992) </ref>. It is this problem that precedes the treatment of learning as statistical inference, as the choice of representation class that a learner possesses will largely determine the success of learning as statistical inference.

Reference-contexts: Rather, it is thought to be a representation-independent result concerning the unlearnability of some class relative to any class of representations. Is this claim justified? The answer is nothe only representation-independent results concern complicated cryptographic functions, such as polyrandom functions <ref> (Goldreich et al. 1984) </ref>. Since natural systems are not thought to be confronted with the general decryption problem, these results are of little relevance to the learnability of natural functions. Hence, there is no justification for the claim that functions of interest to natural systems are representation-independent unlearnable.

That the determination of dendritic form is dependent on patterned afferent activity is supported by analogous experiments by Katz and Constantine-Paton (1988) in the vertebrate optic tectum.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, coverage area of the arbor also increased during this time, an increase which becomes significant by postnatal day 39, which is still about half the coverage area of a mature axonal arbor <ref> (Humphrey et al. 1985) </ref>. Antonini and Stryker conclude (1993, p.3572) that, ``[N] development thus appears to involve both selective elimination of widely extended branches and considerable growth and elaboration.'' It is indeed difficult to reconcile these findings with a strictly regressive model.

Reference-contexts: Such a cell thus has the property that it can perform the nonlinear discrimination that requires a hidden-layer network of connectionist neurons. More biological versions have also been proposed <ref> (Jaslove 1992) </ref>. According to this view, along with others positing nonlinear dendritic processing, the pattern of termination onto a dendritic tree is of central importance to the determination of the integrative properties of that cell.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we examine the relation between dendritic growth and activity in more detail. One model system in which this question has been addressed is the development of ocular dominance columns (introduced in section 2.3.1), in which the relation between OD columns and dendritic form may be assessed <ref> (Katz et al. 1989) </ref>. A particularly interesting question concerns what would happen to those cells near a border between two columns.

Reference-contexts: A primary reason for this is that the kinetic properties of the NMDA-receptor fit with the cooperative account of synaptic plasticity involved in both developmental findings (reviewed in Shatz 1990; Cline 1991) and in mature forms of plasticity <ref> (Kelso et al. 1986) </ref>. The view of learning and development stemming from the associative conditions of the NMDA-receptor fall under the rubric of Hebbian learning. In development, however, Hebbian learning is generally limited to governing the stabilization of existing synapses, as on the standard model.

Reference-contexts: During development, activity segregates these diffuse projections through selective stabilization and elimination into interdigitating regions. Since the standard model, and the model of OD formation in particular, has been so influential, especially for computational models <ref> (Miller et al. 1989) </ref>, it is important to review the evidence for it. As Stryker notes (1991), almost all of the evidence for this standard model comes from autoradiography by transneuronal transport of 3 H-sugars or amino acids (Hubel & Wiesel 1972; Shatz et al. 1977).

Reference-contexts: The basic idea behind this, then, is that every portion of a dendrite will have a limited temporal window in which activity-dependent processes can effect its structure. Although there are instances in which dendrites that have already undergone development can be altered <ref> (e.g., Mooney et al. 1992) </ref>, the signal that initiates this large-scale modification is itself a large-scale event, such as deafferentation, that requires a change at that scale. Another important fact is that dendrites grow much more slowly that do axons.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the tendency to view the biological basis of development as one not contributing to the learning properties of a system <ref> (e.g., Lenneberg 1967) </ref>, may have also contributed to the lack of interest in the neural basis of cognitive development. In contrast, we have suggested that cognitive and neural processes interact fundamentally throughout development.

Reference-contexts: What could then account for the differing maturation? Although these cell types are nearby one another, they receive input from distinct pathways, the magno- and parvocellular. Under various deprivation conditions that minimized differences in the activity of these pathways, these two cell types showed a more synchronous development <ref> (Lund et al. 1990b) </ref>. As we return to in detail in section 2.2.2, this suggests that differences in afferent drive, and not just intrinsic mechanisms, may play an important role in regulating cellular maturation.

Reference-contexts: principles back to the learning and representational properties of cortex. 3.3 Environmental conditions and dendritic development Unlike axonal growth, which in many cases begins during migration (Shoukimas and Hinds, 1978), dendrites typically do not begin to differentiate prior to the completion of migration and final placement within a cortical layer <ref> (Noback & Purpura 1961) </ref>. This suggests that the cellular environment may be a particularly important factor in determining dendritic form, as studies of genetically altered animals have demonstrated (Rakic & Sidman 1973; Mariani et al. 1977; Caviness & Rakic 1978; Pinto-Lord & Caviness 1979).

Reference-contexts: More specifically, a consequence of the interaction between cognitive and neural processes is that learning episodes may induce changes to the structures involved in learning, which would alter what could be learned during subsequent episodes. A system with such an ability is said to possess the principle of nonstationarity <ref> (e.g., Pinker 1979) </ref>. This principle concerns what may be termed the ``learning mechanism'' or ``acquisition device'', roughly, the set of processes and structures that transform some set of input data into the mature state representing the mature competence.

Reference-contexts: of ``rigorous" learning theories demonstrating that complex skills cannot be learned ``assume that the nature of cognitive processes can be deduced from properties of a fixed computational architecture.'' The appeal of the constructivist position lies precisely in its rejection of this assumption and hence in possessing fundamentally different learning properties <ref> (Quartz 1993) </ref>. In recent years, Chomsky's nativist view has been championed by evolutionary psychologists (e.g., Barkow et al. 1992). Spurred on by the view of development as an intrinsic process, they have sought a phylogenetic source for the intrinsically specified skills comprising the human cognitive repertoire. <p> In slightly more cognitive terms, this growth would correspond to allowing the structure of the input to determine the architecture that is to underlie the representational properties of the region <ref> (Quartz 1993) </ref>. This suggests that the question of the activity-dependence of development is as central as the issue of whether there is a net addition of structure.

Reference-contexts: between dendrites and axons that the structure of the mature system emerges, we will incorporate both these mechanisms in the constructivist schemes we explore in section 4. 3.2 Dendritic arborization The extent to which constructivist principles operate during human development are illustrated by the following classical result from human neuroanatomy <ref> (Schade and van Groenigen 1961) </ref> as illustrated in Figure 3. The basal dendrites of a typical cortical cell of layer III in frontal cortex of a newborn have a total length of just 200 microns (1/5 mm). <p> The average density of synapses on cortical pyramidal neurons is around 1 per micron. V human pyramidal cells; a, newborn; b, 3 months; c, 6 months; d, 15 months; e, 24 months; f, adult <ref> (from Schade & van Groenigen 1961) </ref>. 16 Study System Remarks Mathers, 1979 rabbit visual cortex, l a y e r V p y r a m i d a l cells postnatal expansion of dendritic arbor and length J u r a s k a a n d F i f <p> What is striking about human cortical development, however, is the protractedness of nonvisual cortical development. Cells in frontal cortex are much slower to develop and undergo the majority of their growth after two years of age <ref> (Schade and van Groenigen, 1961) </ref>. In addition, the extent of their postnatal development is dramatic-these cells grow to over thirty times their dendritic length at birth. Scheibel (1993) likewise reports an extended protractedness of dendritic development in Broca's area, in which mature morphologies emerge only after 6-8 years.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that regressive events should be viewed as the more general consequence of any theory which rejects a strong view of neural specificity <ref> (Sperry 1963) </ref>. Any such view must posit stochastic sampling mechanisms, which by their very nature introduce error into a system. A constructive view allows for these sampling mechanisms to be directed, though probabilistic in nature, and so will likewise require an error-correction process, such as structural elimination.

Reference-contexts: Representative studies demonstrate the effects of rearing and manipulations to activity on synaptic numbers. See text for details. 10 certainly false. Nonlinear dendritic conductance properties, now well established <ref> (Stuart & Sakmann 1994) </ref>, thus shift the emphasis from absolute synaptic numbers to the spatial arrangement of synapses and the branching patterns of postsynaptic structures. This suggests that axonal and dendritic arborization may be more central determinants of circuit complexity than absolute synaptic numbers.

Reference-contexts: These studies are important sources of evidence for distinguishing between competing models of development since they can distinguish between activity-dependent and independent modes of growth throughout the lifespan and, in some cases, can correlate specific structural changes that correspond to a single manipulated parameter <ref> (e.g., Tieman & Hirsch 1982) </ref>. As we describe, analogous findings in mature animals rule out the possibility that these changes reflect only increased or decreased stabilization of present structure.
