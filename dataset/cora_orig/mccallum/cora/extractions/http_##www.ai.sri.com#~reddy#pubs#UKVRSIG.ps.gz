Title: "Reducing Lags in Virtual Reality Systems using Motion-Sensitive Level of Detail"

Abstract: Most virtual reality systems suffer from a time lag which can detrimentally affect the user's performance. This paper describes the major components of this lag and details the factors which contribute towards it. The use of Level of Detail (LOD) is one possible way to reduce the lag. This technique is normally implemented on a distance-based criterion (i.e. lower levels of detail are used when an object is far away); however, I am currently investigating the use of Level of Detail in relation to the velocity of each object in a virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: Sensor Delay, 2. Processing Delay, 3. Rendering Delay <ref> (Atkin, 1993) </ref>. These are defined as follows. SystemLag = SensorDelay + P rocessingDelay + RenderingDelay: (1) 1 Sensor Delay is the lag which is induced by sampling the real environment (e.g. tracking the user's head or hand) and passing this information to the computer system.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that humans can detect head tracking lags of greater than 5 msec and that delays of longer than 30 msec can produce effects of motion sickness and hinder operator performance <ref> (Frank et al., 1988) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This idea has been suggested in the past and a couple of researchers have even developed systems based upon this concept <ref> (Funkhouser and Sequin, 1993) </ref>. However, these have normally been implemented in a rather ad hoc fashion with little consideration given to the characteristics of the human visual system and how it functions.

Reference-contexts: Therefore images composed of many areas of sharply contrasting intensity will contain mostly high spatial frequency components; whereas images with relatively smoother transitions will generally contain low spatial frequencies <ref> (Humphreys and Bruce, 1991) </ref>. This implies that a scene which has a large number of sharp, well-defined edges will be characterised by higher spatial frequencies than a scene with smooth, rounded features.

Reference-contexts: It therefore makes sense to substitute a lower LOD model when the object is beyond a certain distance in order to improve the efficiency of the system without unduly affecting the fidelity of the display. This technique has been used successfully in numerous flight and car simulators <ref> (Kemeny, 1993) </ref>. 3.2 Generating Level of Detail Attempting to produce a different LOD model by hand is a very tedious and approximate process. It is therefore desirable for the computer to generate lower LOD models automatically from an original object (i.e. reduce the polygonal complexity of an object).

Reference-contexts: This method requires two issues to be resolved: 1. the method for selecting the polygons to be reduced (e.g. area or curvature), and 2. the algorithm to perform the desired reduction. An alternative approach is to use adaptive subdivision <ref> (DeHaemer Jr. and Zyda, 1991) </ref>. This process begins with an initial approximation to a polygon mesh and then refines this approximation by recursively subdivided it at the point where it varies most from the original mesh.

Reference-contexts: The implication of this phenomenon for computer graphics is that we can remove high spatial frequency components of an object when it is in motion and the user's perception of the scene will not be affected <ref> (Nakayama, 1990) </ref>. However, there are two main problems associated with calculating the spatial frequencies of a computer-generated image. These are that it is both viewpoint dependent and field of view (FOV) dependent.
