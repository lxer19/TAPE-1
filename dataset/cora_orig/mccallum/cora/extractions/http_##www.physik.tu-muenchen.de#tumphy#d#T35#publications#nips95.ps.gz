Abstract: Binaural coincidence detection is essential for the localization of external sounds and requires auditory signal processing with high temporal precision. We present an integrate-and-fire model of spike processing in the auditory pathway of the barn owl. It is shown that a temporal precision in the microsecond range can be achieved with neuronal time constants which are at least one magnitude longer. An important feature of our model is an unsupervised Hebbian learning rule which leads to a temporal fine tuning of the neuronal connections.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Owls are able to locate acoustic signals based on extraction of interaural time difference by coincidence detection <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The spatial resolution of sound localization found in experiments corresponds to a temporal resolution of auditory signal processing well below one millisecond. It follows that both the firing of spikes and their transmission along the so-called time pathway of the auditory system must occur with high temporal precision.

Reference-contexts: Each neuron in the nucleus magnocellularis, the second processing stage in the ascending auditory pathway, responds to signals in a narrow frequency range. Its spikes are phase locked to the external signal (Fig. 1a) for frequencies up to 8 kHz <ref> [3] </ref>. Axons from the nucleus magnocellularis project to the nucleus laminaris where signals from the right and left ear converge. Owls use the interaural phase difference for azimuthal sound localization. <p> For the sake of simplicity, we set n = 1. Second, the spikes may occur slightly too early or too late compared to the mean delay . Based on experimental results, we assume a typical shift = 0:05 ms <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This poses at least two severe problems. First, the neural architecture has to be adapted to operating with high temporal precision. Considering the fact that the total delay from the ear to the nucleus magnocellularis is approximately 2-3 ms <ref> [4] </ref>, a temporal precision of some 10 s requires some fine tuning, possibly based on learning. Here we suggest that Hebbian learning is an appropriate mechanism. Second, neurons must operate with the necessary temporal precision. <p> Their axons have different diameter and length leading to a signal transmission delay k which varies between 2 and 3 ms <ref> [4] </ref>. Note that a delay as small as 0.25 ms shifts the signal by half a period. Each input signal consists of a periodic spike train subject to two types of noise.

Reference-contexts: It has been estimated from anatomical data that a fully developed magnocellular neuron receives inputs from as few as 1-4 presynaptic neurons, but each presynaptic axon shows multiple branching near the postsynaptic soma and makes up to one hundred synaptic contacts on the soma of the magnocel-lular neuron <ref> [5] </ref>. The result of our simulation study is consistent with this finding. In our model, learning leads to a final state with a few but highly effective inputs. The remaining inputs all have the same time delay modulo the period T of the stimulus.
