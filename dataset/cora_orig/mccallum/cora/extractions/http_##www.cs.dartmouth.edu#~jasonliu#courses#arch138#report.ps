Abstract: Interconnection network has become one of the most important research areas in parallel processing due to the fact that communication overhead majorly affects the performance of parallel computer systems. In this research report, we investigate major issues and techniques involved in the design and implementation of cost-effective interconnection networks for parallel processing. We first study various parallel machine models in the context of interconnection networks. Different classifications of interconnection networks are presented. The interconnection network designs presented are based on four basic types of interconnection functions: cube, wraparound mesh (Illiac), shu*e-exchange, and PM2I. The partitionability as well as the simulation of single-stage interconnection networks are discussed. Multistage interconnection networks are presented based on two classes of interconnections: generalized cube/shu*e-exchange network families and data manipulator network families. The networks discussed include generalized cube, Omega, STARAN flip, SW-banyan, Data manipulator, ADM and IADM.

Reference-contexts: However, the permutation abilities of the networks differ. The STARAN flip network. The STARAN flip network is the network implemented in the STARAN SIMD machine <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 17 shows the STARAN flip network for N = 8. At each stage i, input j can be connected either to output j or output C i (j), where 0 i &lt; m and 0 j &lt; N .

Reference-contexts: Data manipulator network. The data manipulator network <ref> [2] </ref> is shown in figure 19 for N = 8. For a parallel processing system, consisting of N input ports and N output posts (assuming that N is a power of two), there are m = log 2 N stages.

Reference-contexts: As specified by the definition, a partitionable-SIMD/MIMD machine extends the operation of multiple-SIME where each processor can follow its own instructions. Like multiple-SIMD machines, the partitionable-SIMD/MIMD system can be partitioned to form independent virtual machines. 2.4 The interconnection networks As specified by Flynn <ref> [3] </ref>, the overall topology of the interconnection network determines the effectiveness of the communication in three ways: latency, bandwidth, and cost. Nevertheless, several other issues need also be addressed in the design and implementation of the interconnection network: permutation capacity, partitionability, and reliability. <p> Many issues are left out, which include network analysis, partitioning and reconfiguration, reliability and fault-tolerance, etc. As a final remark, based on a number of recent important analyses on various network configurations, Flynn <ref> [3] </ref> pointed out that interconnection network designers prefer interconnection networks with low dimensionality and static configuration.

Reference-contexts: Such control structure limits the capabilities of the flip network in comparison to the generalized cube network with individual-box control. The SW-banyan network. The classification of different network topologies using banyan networks was discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. A banyan network is a type of directed graph and SW-banyan is a sub-class of banyan network. A SW-banyan network can be specified by spread S, fanout F and level L.

Reference-contexts: The control structure of a network defines how the states of the interchange boxes can be set. Three types of control structures used in multistage cube-type networks are individual-stage control, partial-stage control and individual-box control. The Omega network. The Omega network <ref> [6] </ref> is a multistage implementation based on the the single-stage shu*e-exchange network. Figure 15 shows the topology of an Omega network for N = 8. It is shown that the topology of the Omega network is the same as that of the generalized cube.

Reference-contexts: A banyan network is a type of directed graph and SW-banyan is a sub-class of banyan network. A SW-banyan network can be specified by spread S, fanout F and level L. The use of SW-banyan 12 with S = F = 2 and L = m is proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. Figure 18 shows an example of SW-banyan network where N = 8; m = log 2 N = 3; S = F = 2, and L = m = 3. SW-banyan refers to a class of network graphs.

Reference-contexts: In fact, they are often chosen to be relatively prime, which allows conflict-free accesses of the shared memories by as many PEs as possible. An example of processor-to-memory SIMD machine is the Burroughs Scientific Processor (BSP). The mathematical model presented here is based on <ref> [8] </ref>, which provides a common formal basis for evaluating and comparing different SIMD machines. <p> The ability of an interconnection network to simulate other interconnection networks are of important consideration in the design and implementation of interconnection networks. In this section, we present the lower and upper time bounds on SIMD machine interconnection networks. The results shown here are due to Siegel <ref> [8] </ref>. The lower bound is the proved minimum number of parallel data transfers required to perform the simulation. The upper bound is the maximum number of transfer needed, which comes from the actual algorithm that perform the simulation.

Reference-contexts: and upper bounds on the transfer time required for network i to simulate network j. m = log 2 N and n = p 9 3.3 The partitionability of single-stage networks The partitionability of an interconnection network is the ability to divide the network into independent subnetworks of different sizes <ref> [9] </ref>. The partitionability of the interconnection network is important for use by multiple-SIMD or partitionable-SIMD/MIMD systems where the system can be dynamically reconfigured into independent sub-systems. As we mentioned earlier, an interconnection function is a bijection on the set of input and output addresses.

Reference-contexts: Finally, section 5 gives our conclusions. 2 Parallel-machine models and interconnection networks This section presents differnet models of parallel computing systems in the context of interconnection networks. These parallel computer models include SIMD, MIMD, multiple-SIMD and partitionable-SIMD/MIMD machines <ref> [10] </ref>. We present a brief introduction to the parallel machine models in which large-scale parallel computer systems can be organized.

Reference-contexts: Broadcast-routing tags allow the broadcast of data to an arbitrary number of destinations. These routing tag schemes enable the network control to be distributed. The inverse augmented data manipulator (IADM) network. The inverse augmented data manipulator (IADM) network <ref> [11] </ref> is identical to the ADM network except that the stages are reversed; that is the stages are ordered from 0 to m 1. Same as the ADM network, the IADM network has individual switching element control. There are multiple paths between most source/destination pairs.

Reference-contexts: Comparing with figure 1, a multiple-SIMD machine consists of multiple control units, each of which can be connected to some subset of the PEs and configured to perform an independent task. As specified by Seigel et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, a multiple-SIMD offers several advantages over a single SIMD system: * Fault detection and fault tolerance. * Multiple simultaneous users. * Scalability makes easier program development and debugging. * Efficiency less wasted PEs. * Multi-task parallelism. A multiple-SIMD machine is preferable in many environments to an single SIMD machine.

Reference-contexts: If the network is built from stages of the PM2I interconnection functions, the network is known as data manipulator network. 4.1 Multistage cube/shu*e-exchange networks The generalized cube network <ref> [13] </ref> is based on the cube and shu*e-exchange interconnection functions. This type of network has been proposed for use in many super-scale parallel systems. Also, the generalized-cube network is used as the basis for many other networks: the Omega network, the STARAN flip network, 10 indirect binary n-cube network, etc. <p> By repositioning interchange box F and G, the result is a network identical to the generalized cube network. The Omega network has four-function interchange boxes and individual-box control using the destination-tag scheme. The indirect binary n-cube network. The indirect binary n-cube network <ref> [13] </ref> is shown for N = 8 in figure 16. The topology of the indirect binary n-cube is the same as that of the generalized cube 11 network, except that the stages are reversed. The interchange boxes are two-functional with individual-box control. <p> The augmented data manipulator (ADM) network is a data manipulator network with individual switching element control <ref> [13] </ref>. Each switching element can be set independently as straight, up or down. Any one-to-one or broadcast connection is physically possible in the ADM network. the ADM networks has only one path between a source and a destination when the source and the destination are the same.

Reference-contexts: Interconnection network plays an important role in parallel processing arena. As specified by Scherson and Youssef <ref> [14] </ref>, an over-simplification of the basic problem in interconnection networks would be: "Given a set of processor nodes, define a set of links (or connections) between them such that all nodes can communicate at minimum cost." Of course, as they mentioned, such over-simplification cannot possibly justify over 30 years of research
