This result was recently improved by Allender and Strauss <ref> [1] </ref>, who proved that, for 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1 3 , the set of all A satisfying E A " H A ff = ; has p-measure 0. The following lemma is a small, but useful, extension of this fact. Lemma 3.2. <p> Lemma 3.2. For all 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1 3 and all S 2 E, n fi fi E A " H AS o Proof.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 concerns the lowness of self-reducible languages with polynomial-size circuits. Karp and Lipton <ref> [8] </ref> used self-reducibility to show that, if the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to P 2 , then NP 6 P=Poly, i.e., NP does not have polynomial-size circuits. <p> A principal component of current understanding of this relationship is the proof by Karp and Lipton <ref> [8] </ref> that, if P 2 6= PH, then NP 6 P=Poly. That is, if the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse to P 2 , then NP does not have polynomial-size circuits. The following recent result allows a significant weakening of Karp and Lipton's hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Klapper [9] strengthed this by establishing that all of AM " co-AM is low for P 2 . More recently, Kobler, Schoning, and Toran <ref> [13] </ref> showed that AM " co-AM is, in fact, low for AM. Theorem 4.2 below notes that, under the hypothesis p ( P 2 ) 6= 0, AM " co-AM is also low for P 2 . <p> Thus, if p ( P 2 ) 6= 0 and polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse to P 2 , then NP does not have polynomial-size circuits. 2 Preliminaries The reader is referred to any of the texts <ref> [2, 4, 13, 28] </ref> for basic material on complexity classes, relativized complexity classes, the polynomial-time hierarchy, feasible reductions, self-reducibility, polynomial advice, and (Boolean) circuits. Oracle circuits are described in [34, 24]. For each k 1, QBF k is the well-known k-quantified Boolean formula problem. <p> The demonstration is easy, using Theorem 3.3 and the following known result. Theorem 4.1 (Kobler, Schoning, and Toran <ref> [13] </ref>). AM " co-AM is low for AM. The following observation is now easily established. Theorem 4.2. If p ( P 2 ) 6= 0, then AM " co-AM is low for P 2 . Proof. Assume the hypothesis. <p> Corollary 4.3. If p ( P 2 ) 6= 0, then BPP is low for P 2 . Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 4.2 and the fact that BPP AM " co-AM. fl The graph isomorphism problem is known to be in NP " co-AM <ref> [13] </ref>, which is contained in AM " co-AM. This gives the following corollaries. Corollary 4.4. If p ( P 2 ) 6= 0, then the graph isomorphism problem is low for P Corollary 4.5.

Reference-contexts: Ko and Schoning [11] refined this by showing that every language in NP that has polynomial-size circuits is low for P 2 . Very recently, Kobler and Watanabe <ref> [14] </ref> have significantly improved upon these results by showing that every self-reducible language with polynomial-size circuits in fact, every self-reducible language in (NP " co-NP)/Poly is low for ZPP (NP). Thus, if the polynomial-time 3 hierarchy does not collapse to ZPP (NP), then NP does not have polynomial--size circuits. <p> That is, if the polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse to P 2 , then NP does not have polynomial-size circuits. The following recent result allows a significant weakening of Karp and Lipton's hypothesis. Theorem 5.1 (Kobler and Watanabe <ref> [14] </ref>). 1. Every self-reducible language in (NP"co-NP)=Poly is low for ZPP (NP). 13 2. If k 1, and ZPP ( P k ) 6= PH, then P k 6 ( P k )=Poly. Corollary 5.2. If ZPP (NP) 6= PH, then NP 6 (NP " co-NP)=Poly.

Reference-contexts: Recent investigations have shown that a number of these conjectures do follow from the (apparently) stronger hypothesis that NP does not have p-measure 0.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if p ( P 2 ) 6= 0 and polynomial-time hierarchy does not collapse to P 2 , then NP does not have polynomial-size circuits. 2 Preliminaries The reader is referred to any of the texts <ref> [2, 4, 13, 28] </ref> for basic material on complexity classes, relativized complexity classes, the polynomial-time hierarchy, feasible reductions, self-reducibility, polynomial advice, and (Boolean) circuits. Oracle circuits are described in [34, 24]. For each k 1, QBF k is the well-known k-quantified Boolean formula problem.

Reference-contexts: The remaining observations of this paper, presented in sections 4 and 5, involve lowness for P 2 and follow easily from Theorem 3.3 and recent results in computational complexity. The concept of lowness originated in recursion theory and was introduced to complexity theory by Schoning <ref> [29] </ref>. A language A f0; 1g fl is low for a relativizable complexity class C if C (A) = C, i.e., if oracle access to A does not increase the computational power of C.

Reference-contexts: Kobler [12] has recently provided a useful survey of lowness results in complexity theory. Section 4 concerns the lowness of probabilistic complexity classes. Zachos and Heller [36] proved that BPP is low for P 2 . Schoning <ref> [30] </ref> improved this by showing that NP " co-AM is low for P 2 , whence the graph isomorphism problem is low for P 2 . Klapper [9] strengthed this by establishing that all of AM " co-AM is low for P 2 .

Reference-contexts: Section 3 contains the main observation of this paper, which concerns the effect of the BP-operator on the classes P k (k 2) of the polynomial time hierarchy. The BP-operator, introduced by Schoning <ref> [31] </ref> and discussed in section 2 below, assigns to each complexity class C a complexity class BP C, which can be regarded as a "feasibly randomized version" of C. <p> Two important special-case values of this operator are the bounded-error probabilistic polynomial-time class BPP = BP P and the Arthur-Merlin class AM = BP NP. Generalizing the proofs by Lautemann [15] and Sipser and Gacs [32] that BPP P 2 " P 2 , Schoning <ref> [31] </ref> showed that, for all k 1, BP P k+1 . This result, in combination with more elementary facts, established the inclusion structure depicted in Figure 1. 1 p ( P 2 The hypothesis p ( P 2 ) 6= 0 simplifies this inclusion structure. <p> Then p j=0 k=j ! The BP-operator, introduced by Schoning <ref> [31] </ref>, is defined as follows. <p> For all "reasonable" classes C including all complexity classes discussed in this note - Schoning <ref> [31] </ref> has shown that C BP C and that, in inequality (2.1), any real number fi 2 ( 1 2 ; 1) can be used in place of 2 3 without changing the resulting class BP C. 3 The classes BP P This section shows that, if P 2 does not
