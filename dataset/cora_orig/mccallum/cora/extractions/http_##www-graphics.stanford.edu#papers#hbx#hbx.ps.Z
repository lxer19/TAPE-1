Title: Higher Bandwidth X

Note: (Extended Abstract) Submitted to ACM MULTIMEDIA '94  
Abstract: Network bandwidth has always been a key issue for multimedia protocols. Many potential users of networked multimedia protocols will continue to have low bandwidth network connections for some time: copper wire ISDN, infra-red, cellular modems, etc.. Compression provides potential relief for users of slow networks by increasing effective bandwidth. HBX introduces a new technique, based on arithmetic coding and statistical modeling, for compressing structured data. Applied to the X networked graphics protocol, this technique yields 4.5:1 compression across a representative set of traces, performing twice as well as the popular LZW-based Xremote compression protocol. HBX's coding techniques are generally applicable to the graphics and imaging subset of multimedia protocols. Future work will determine whether HBX's coding techniques can be applied to audio and video streams as well.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms will continue to include compression. 3 Strategies for Managing Bandwidth Networked graphics has a relatively long history, and bandwidth has been a recurring issue. Two major techniques for managing bandwidth have emerged: * Explicit support: The best example of this technique is the Networked extensible Window System <ref> [1] </ref> (NeWS) in which applications can load postscript programs into the server.

A complete 4th order model would incorporate 2 40 frequencies, so successful implementations make provisions for blending estimates from lower order models with estimates from higher order models when higher order statistics are incomplete. HBX uses a technique called lazy exclusions [2] for blending these probabilities. 8 HBX HBX's connection <p> text most effectively at 3rd or 4th order <ref> [2] </ref>. A complete 4th order model would incorporate 2 40 frequencies, so successful implementations make provisions for blending estimates from lower order models with estimates from higher order models when higher order statistics are incomplete. HBX uses a technique called lazy exclusions [2] for blending these probabilities. 8 HBX HBX's connection level architecture was shown in Figure 2. Since the values or symbols appearing in each field in each X message type may have different distributions, HBX associates a unique predictive model with each field in each X message type. <p> X is a graphics protocol, supporting text, geometry and images. Other types of data are also important, such as window-ids, timestamps, and sequence numbers. Here are the predictive models used by HBX for each of these datatypes: Text model: 3rd order context.

Reference-contexts: This technique yields 4.5:1 compression across a representative suite of traces, while the popular LZW-based Xremote compression protocol <ref> [3] </ref> only achieves 2.3:1 compression on the same set of traces. Graphics protocols such as X present a different compression challenge from audio and video streams for several reasons: * X must be compressed losslessly. <p> The Xremote protocol is described by Cornelius <ref> [3] </ref>. Danskin and Hanrahan implemented an Xremote simulator from NCD's spec and measured its compression performance across a suite of representative traces [5]. Neither clients nor server need be aware of Xremote.

Reference-contexts: For good compression, all of these must be compressed effectively. * X packets are small and include mixed types: Most X packets are less than 100 bytes long <ref> [4] </ref>. An effective compression protocol cannot waste bits shifting gears between com pression techniques. In the rest of the paper, Section 2 discusses the outlook for software network compression. Section 3 surveys strategies for managing bandwidth in networked graphics protocols. Section 4 is a short introduction to the X protocol. <p> This means that X sessions are not repeatable in the way that standard computer benchmarks are repeatable. In order to assess the performance of X compression protocols in a way that permits fair comparisons, it is necessary to gather traces. A previous paper <ref> [4] </ref> discussed tracing techniques and the choice of traces, introduced a taxonomy of X messages, and characterized X applications and quantified their network bandwidth requirements. The set of traces used to generate the results presented here is shown in Table 1. <p> XTee and the traces are described in <ref> [4] </ref>. for the media server to send graphics primitives. <p> Default model: 0 order context. Fields effectively using this model include: window-ids, graphics-context-ids, and length fields. 10 There are many X messages. Specifying predictive models for each field in each message would be a dreary task. Fortunately, most X traffic is generated by just a few messages <ref> [4] </ref>. This means that we can reap most of the benefits of optimizing all of the messages by optimizing just a few important ones. By default, HBX assigns a 0 order context model to each field in each message.
