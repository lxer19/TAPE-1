Abstract: amining the problem with a source transmitting to a fixed set of destinations (the multicast group) which are known when communication is established. There are clearly some applications for which the set of destinations will be dynamic, with destinations joining and leaving the multicast group during the communication. Under these conditions the computation of an "optimal" spanning tree for each new multicast group may not be the best way to proceed. An alternative is to make modest alterations to an existing spanning tree to derive a new one. An extreme variation of this is to use minimal cost source to destination routing for each destination, effectively ignoring the existing multicast tree. This nave approach leads to a simple implementation but clearly produces non-optimal spanning trees. In this paper we examine just how non-optimal these trees are in random general topology networks and conclude that they are worse by only a small factor. The factor is reduced still further if a hierarchy is imposed upon the random network to give a more realistic model.

Reference-contexts: Any scheme which is chosen must also be able to cope with heterogeneous networks <ref> [1] </ref>, where some nodes provide multicast capability and others do not. This situation is likely to arise in the wide area for economic reasons but should be less of a concern in the local area.

Reference-contexts: This situation is likely to arise in the wide area for economic reasons but should be less of a concern in the local area. Another problem is that a route may only have a limited degree of replication available at an intermediate node <ref> [2] </ref>. Multicast groups may be either dynamic or static in nature. A static group, once set up, remains unmodified until it is discarded. A connection to a static group tends to be set up following a request from the source, for instance, file replication across a network.

Reference-contexts: The construction of a Steiner tree for multicast routing is one extreme form of multicast routing, as shown in Figure 1. Previous work on heuristic solutions (summarised by Winter <ref> [5] </ref>) of the MST problem has generally taken one of the two following approaches. In the first approach, likely Steiner nodes are selected and then a minimum spanning tree of these nodes, together with the nodes in S, is constructed [6].

This tree is used as a template to add the relevant shortest paths in G, possibly introducing new nodes.

Reference-contexts: The KMB MST heuristic algorithm, whilst not having a computational complexity as low as others, is relatively simple to implement and shows similar inefficiency characteristics when compared with the other more complex heuristics of both approaches <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. The mean performance of the KMB heuristic is close enough to the optimal solution to permit its use for the purposes of comparison of the simple algorithm introduced in Section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: One is to re-route the whole tree whenever the group membership changes. This may have repercussions for members who remain in the group, since there may be a disturbance in the communication, and in an ATM network <ref> [11] </ref>, such a change may allow cells to arrive out of order at the destination. Another method is to permit partial or local rearrangement of the tree when modifications to the membership occur. This has the same reordering drawback as total re-routing.

Reference-contexts: Use the minimum of the sum of these two weights to decide which existing node in the multicast con nection to route to the new node from. Other proposed costs include the distance from the centre of the tree (see <ref> [14] </ref>, pp. 213-214 for a definition of centrality) or the number of connections attached to a node. The above algorithms all fall into the category of heuristic Steiner trees with addition, as shown in Figure 1.
