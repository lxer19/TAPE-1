Reference-contexts: This paper addresses the problem of efficiently retrieving complex, structured spatial information from an archive of meteorological data. The approach is implemented in MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval, analysis, and display of historical meteorological data <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. MetVUW Workbench is intended to serve as an intelligent assistant for both weather forecasters and meteorology researchers.

Reference-contexts: Detailed examination of particular past cases can also usefully guide analysis of the current situation <ref> [3] </ref>. Meteorology researchers should also be able to benefit from MetVUW Workbench, by using the system to rapidly identify large numbers of examples of empirical phenomena of interest. In the past, large-scale empirical investigations have been impeded by the difficulty of rapidly identifying relevant data.

Reference-contexts: If more detailed analyses are required, larger amounts of data relating to a particular situation can be retrieved using slower media such as CDROM or magnetic tape. MetVUW Workbench can be thought of as a kind of case-based reasoning system <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>. Each case is a slice of time for which meteorological data is available. The available data include satellite imagery stored both in digital form and on laser disc, a document archive, and numeric fields from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).

MetVUW Workbench demonstrates that a relational database can be used to manage a large case base. This approach to the design of case-based reasoning systems should find ready application in the environmental sciences, where knowledge bases are often very large.

Reference-contexts: During the development of MetVUW Workbench, a portion of this numeric data has been employed that covers the Australasian region. This paper focuses on case retrieval in MetVUW Workbench. Case retrieval matches queries (sometimes called index probes <ref> [7] </ref>) against explicitly represented index labels. Queries identify particular features of the current situation that appear to be meteorologically significant. Index labels are representations of high-level features of the weather situation in a case, such as descriptions of high and low pressure systems.

Reference-contexts: We use an advanced relational database called Postgres <ref> [8] </ref> to implement case selection. Case selection is efficient in part because it employs a number of 5 northeast of New Zealand. sophisticated indexing strategies that Postgres provides, in particular, R-tree indexing of spatial information [9].

We will see, however, that to achieve maximum efficiency of case selection, an innovative representation for index labels is also required.

Reference-contexts: We now briefly consider each of these subtasks. Similarity assessment is described in more detail in <ref> [10] </ref>. Similarity assessment begins by computing the pairwise similarity of every region in the query and every region in the case. In assessing pairwise similarity, no distinction is made between regions internal to a cluster and the simple low or high-pressure regions at the cluster's leaves.
