Title: Modeling and Identifying Bottlenecks in EOSDIS  
Author: James Demmel Melody Y. Ivory Sharon L. Smith 
Abstract: NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) is a series of polar-orbiting and low-inclination satellites that will furnish global space-based measurements to advance scientific understanding of the entire Earth system, including hydrologic, biogeochemical, atmospheric, ecological, and geophysical processes. The EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) is a multi-million dollar hardware and software system that will enable scientists to access data generated by EOS. An EOSDIS architecture has been proposed to facilitate efficient organization and high performance retrieval of EOS data, however, the architecture needs to be examined to insure that EOSDIS will deliver adequate performance for anticipated workloads. We use performance modeling to identify bottlenecks in EOSDIS for two rep resentative user scenarios from climate change research.

Reference-contexts: For the particular scenario described here, we assume that atmospheric variables, such as wind speeds, temperatures, pressures and humidities, have been archived from observational data or from model data created by a general circulation model, such as the UCLA AGCM <ref> [1, 9, 10] </ref>. These variables are then used as forced input to an atmospheric chemical tracer model, such as the gas, aerosol, transport and radiation model (GATOR) [7, 8, 6].

Reference-contexts: In addition, NASA is supporting several research efforts to carry EOSDIS into the 21st century. Among these is a project at the University of California at Berkeley that has built a prototype database architecture called Bigsur <ref> [2] </ref> to handle the database management system activities of EOSDIS. In addition, a hardware architecture has been proposed [5] that addresses scalability issues for EOSDIS. In this paper we scrutinize the performance of the proposed tertiary storage system for EOSDIS.

Reference-contexts: The organization of multi-dimensional arrays, other than a purely linear allocation in which arrays are stored to disk in some contiguous ordering of the dimensions such as column-major or row-major order, has been the subject of several recent studies <ref> [3, 13] </ref>. Research shows that efficient array organization is imperative to minimize the time to process queries of the type that the EOSDIS DBMS will support. Consequently, we experiment with different array organizations to assess the performance tradeoffs of each.

Reference-contexts: We characterize parallelism by the parameter, n tape drives, which is equal the total number of cabinets available to the tertiary storage system. In general, there are possibly multiple drives to a cabinet allowing for parallelism within a cabinet as well as across cabinets. As shown in <ref> [4] </ref>, contention for drives severely limits the ability to access drives simultaneously within a cabinet, so we conservatively assume that only one tape per cabinet can be accessed at any given time.

Because EOSDIS will cost millions of dollars to build, we want to examine whether the system will deliver adequate performance for the anticipated workloads. <p> Scientific data in EOSDIS. NASA's EOSDIS is targeted for a scientific user community on a grand scale. The scientific community will want to access several different types of data for studying global change. Processing will be on the following types of remote-sensing and model output data <ref> [5] </ref>: 1. Raw data from instruments turned into the minimal data set that scientists can use. 2. Calibrated data, or the raw data with calibration applied and in the appropriate units. 3. Scientific products interpreted from calibrated data to provide Earth Science measurements. 4. <p> Next we expand the timing model to capture the communication costs of sending data over a network. 3.1.1. Tertiary Storage Systems We model two high-density linear tape systems representative of the Super DAAC and Peer DAAC systems described in the EOSDIS alternative architecture report <ref> [5] </ref>. An IBM NTP 3495 DLT robot represents the high speed tertiary storage system for a Super DAAC while a DEC TL820 DLT robot represents the lower cost tertiary storage system for a Peer DAAC. Table 3.1 outlines characteristics of these systems. <p> This strategy has to be supportive of the range of queries that the EOSDIS DMBS will handle. EOSDIS researchers estimate that 80% to 90% of these queries will be ad hoc <ref> [5] </ref> which means that optimal chunk strategies, such as the ones used for each scenario, may not exhibit good performance in general. This was demonstrated by using the scenario 1 archive and optimal shape to process the query for scenario 2.

Reference-contexts: Tape allocation determines how much of a tape can be used for data relevant to our archive. In this paper we assume that 25% of each tape accessed is dedicated to our archive. We discuss other tape allocation policies in <ref> [14] </ref>. Tape layout policies determine how tapes are distributed among cabinets in the tertiary storage system. We use optimal tape layout policies for both scenarios in this paper and explore other policies in [14]. <p> We discuss other tape allocation policies in <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Paradigm for climate change research. In order to evaluate the performance of EOSDIS, it is essential to understand the paradigm by which climate modelers will use EOSDIS to facilitate their research. As described in <ref> [15] </ref>, "A scientific investigation usually proceeds from a basic question to the application of an analysis technique, which in turn leads to a result." The analysis tends to raise additional questions, which then lead to a cycle of new analyses, results, and questions.
