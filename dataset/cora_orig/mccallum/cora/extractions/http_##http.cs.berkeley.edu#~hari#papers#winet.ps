Abstract: Srinivasan Seshan (ACM S 1993, IEEE S 93) is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Cali-fornia at Berkeley. His main area of research interest is computer networks especially network protocols to support mobile computing. He is also interested in other areas of communication systems, mobile computing and distributed computing. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1990 and 1993 respectively . He is a member of member of the Eta Kappa Nu and T au Beta Pi honor societies. E-mail: ss@CS.Berkeley.EDU WWW URL: http://www.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~ss Professor Randy H. Katz is a leading researcher in computer system design and implementation. His research experience has spanned numerous disciplines. He has written over 120 technical publications on CAD, database management, multiprocessor architectures, high performance storage systems, and video server architectures. He was responsible for developing the concept of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), now a $3 billion industry segment. Katzs recent research has focused on wireless communications and mobile computing applications. From January 1993 through December 1994, Katz was a program manager and deputy director of the Computing Systems Technology Office of ARPA. He was responsible for wiring the White House to the Internet, and also assisted the Clinton Administration in formulating policies related to the National Information Infrastructure and wireless technologies.
