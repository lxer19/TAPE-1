Abstract: The number and arrangement of semantic tags must be constrained, lest the size and complexity of the tagging sets (tagsets) used for semantic annotation become unwieldy both for humans and computers. The description of lexical predicates within the framework of frame semantics provides a natural method for selecting and structuring appropriate tagsets. The research presented here is to be conducted under the FrameNet research project at the University of California. 1 On this project our primary aim is to produce frame-semantic descriptions of lexical items; our concern with semantically tagged corpora is at both ends of our research. That is, we expect to use partially semantically tagged corpora in the investigation stage|perhaps nothing more than having WordNet hypernyms associated with nouns|but we will produce semantically tagged corpus lines as a by-product of our work. Most major grammatical theories now accept the general principle that some set of semantic roles ("case roles", "thematic roles", or "theta roles") is necessary for characterizing the semantic relations that a predicate can have to its arguments. This would seem to be one obvious starting-point for choosing a tag set for semantically annotating corpora, but there is no agreement as to the

Reference-contexts: This is both a practical and theoretical problem. We have shown a few clear examples in which the judicious use of the notion of inheritance, along the general lines of the ACQUILEX Project <ref> (Briscoe 1993) </ref>, should permit the concise representation of the lexical knowledge required to give a useful and relatively complete description of a word's semantic range.
