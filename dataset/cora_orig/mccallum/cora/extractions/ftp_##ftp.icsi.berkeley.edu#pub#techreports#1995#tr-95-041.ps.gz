Abstract: Recently, shruti has been proposed as a connectionist model of rapid reasoning. It demonstrates how a network of simple neuron-like elements can encode a large number of specific facts as well as systematic knowledge (rules) involving n-ary relations, quantification and concept hierarchies, and perform a class of reasoning with extreme efficiency. The model, however, does not deal with negated facts and rules involving negated antecedents and consequents. We describe an extension of shruti that can encode positive as well as negated knowledge and use such knowledge during reflexive reasoning. The extended model explains how an agent can hold inconsistent knowledge in its long-term memory without being "aware" that its beliefs are inconsistent, but detect a contradiction whenever inconsistent beliefs that are within a certain inferential distance of each other become co-active during an episode of reasoning. Thus the model is not logically omniscient, but detects contradictions whenever it tries to use inconsistent knowledge. The extended model also explains how limited attentional focus or action under time pressure can lead an agent to produce an erroneous response. A biologically significant feature of the model is that it uses only local inhibition to encode negated knowledge. Like the basic model, the extended model encodes and propagates dynamic bindings using temporal synchrony.

The idea that synchronous activity can encode feature bindings during visual processing had been suggested by von der Malsburg (1986) <ref> (also see Bienenstock & Geman 1995) </ref>, but shruti is the first detailed model that shows how synchronous activation can be harnessed to solve non-trivial problems in the representation of conceptual knowledge and reasoning. 2.2.6 Parallelism and the significance of structure The encoding of rules by the explicit encoding of the inferential

Reference-contexts: The solution to the problem of negation and the treatment of inconsistency proposed above is considerably simpler than the one suggested in <ref> (Cottrell 1993) </ref>. The latter had suggested that the entire predicate bank be duplicated for each predicate. In this scheme, each predicate P would have two separate banks of role, enabler and collector nodes: one for positive knowledge about P (+P), and another for negative knowledge about P (-P).

Reference-contexts: Observe that the proposed representation of a predicate is consistent with the notion of "convergence zones" <ref> (Damasio 1989) </ref>. Before specifying the computational behavior of the nodes in a predicate cluster, let us examine their semantic import. The significance of role nodes is as expected | each role node represents a role of the predicate. The representational significance of the enabler and collector nodes is as follows.
