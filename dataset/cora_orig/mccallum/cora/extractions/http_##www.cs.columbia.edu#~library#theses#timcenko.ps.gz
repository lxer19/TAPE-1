Reference-contexts: First, we will prove a theorem that lets us define the binary operation with a commutative group property through an appropriately chosen "generating" function. Then, we will demonstrate that defined through a particular "generating" function satisfies conditions 4.4. The following theorem is an adaptation of results in <ref> [ Aczel, 1989 ] </ref> : A.4 Chapter 4 Supplement 153 Theorem 1 Let f : R ! R be monotonic function, and let f 1 be its inverse function.

Reference-contexts: The A* algorithm is a standard search algorithm, described in most textbooks on AI. Its implementation requires maintaining two data structures (traditionally called OPEN and CLOSE lists) that support operations INSERT, DELETE, MEMBER and MIN. One of the data structures that efficiently support these operations is a 2-3 tree <ref> [ Aho et al., 1974 ] </ref> with log n complexity for INSERT, DELETE and MEMBER (n is the length of a list) and constant time for MIN. Another important part of the A* algorithm is the heuristic function. <p> The dependency parameter ` is available from the PQT for each non-leaf node. The computational complexity of the algorithm 4.8 is easily derived from the divide and conquer theorem <ref> [ Aho et al., 1974 ] </ref> and it is O (kAk log kAk). This is more complex than the trivial linear-time algorithm that looks for the maximal probability among the set of given pixels.

Reference-contexts: The tracking of the object in the xy plane is done using a local model that we present in Appendix A.5.2, while the tracking in z is done with a Cartesian displacement using the fixed gain filter described in <ref> [ Allen et al., 1992b ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The tracking system consists of two fixed cameras that can image a scene containing a moving object (figure 5.20). A PUMA-560 with a parallel jaw gripper attached is used to track and pick up the object as it moves (figure 5.21). The system operates as follows <ref> [ Allen et al., 1993b ] </ref> : * The imaging system performs a stereoscopic optic-flow calculation at each pixel in the image. <p> The model of the motion we are using separates 3-D space into an xy plane and the z axis, and addresses these two components of motion separately. In the experimental results presented in <ref> [ Allen et al., 1993b ] </ref> , this model has been used to track planar trajectories. <p> The estimation of the parameter is done on-line during tracking and is incorporated into the filtering scheme of the tracking system. Theoretical investigation of this stochastic model hasn't been done but it received strong experimental support from tracking/grasping experiments with required accuracy in the millimeter range <ref> [ Allen et al., 1993b ] </ref> . The exposition presented here demonstrates that the underlying model of the random phenomenon encountered in the visual tracking system is a SDE.

Reference-contexts: Before we elaborate on this formulation, let's make a quick comment on how mother nature deals with a similar problem. It has been recognized in the psychology literature (see for example <ref> [ Hogan, 1984; Atkeson and Hollerbach, 1985 ] </ref> ) that the time-constrained pointing movements of monkeys as well as humans follow a bell-shaped profile that is close to a solution of a minimum-jerk model.

Reference-contexts: The experiments were conducted on the Sparc II computer. It is important to note that the execution times are significantly longer then those reported in <ref> [ Barraquand and Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> , obtained on similar hardware. This increase is due to the added functionality for handling uncertainties (specifically, the computation of fail for each configuration). Experiment 2 was conducted with two different cost functions. <p> It shows that the increase in the number of nodes, as expected, quadruples in each higher level of resolution. Different ideas for parallelization of the path planning process can be found in [ Lozano-Perez, 1991 ] , <ref> [ Barraquand and Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Challou et al., 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: This so-called bitmap representation where an object is represented as a set of "colored" pixels rather then a set of algebraic constraints, exemplified by a successful implementation of a path planning for many degrees of freedom in <ref> [ Barraquand et al., 1990 ] </ref> and related work [ Faverjon and Tournassoud, 1987; Faverjon and Tournassoud, 1988 ] . The attractiveness of bitmap descriptions is twofold: firstly, raw sensor data tend to support bitmap representations more naturally and secondly, this approach encourages the applications of parallel computations.

Reference-contexts: Much more importantly, the absence of the attractive force removes the problem of local minima. If we assume that the metric tensor is positive definite (which we will always do), the nonexistence of local minima in the metric tensor method can be proved using Bellman's optimality principle <ref> [ Bellman, 1965 ] </ref> (see Appendix B for the definition).

Reference-contexts: The review of the research effort in this area here is mainly based on [ Pearl, 1988 ] , [ Kanal and Lemmer, 1986 ] and [ Dean and Wellman, 1991 ] . According to <ref> [ Bhatnager and Kanal, 1986 ] </ref> , the deficiency of information allowable to the system is considered uncertain in several different aspects. It can be incomplete, contradictory, unreliable, or imprecise.

Reference-contexts: There are several algorithms that address the problem of computing the DDM in different setups [ Rosenfeld and Pfaltz, 1968; Borgefors, 1984; Borgefors, 1986; Mullikin, 1992; Dorst and Verbeek, 1986; Boult, 1987 ] . In the following text we will present a slight generalization of algorithms presented in <ref> [ Borgefors, 1984 ] </ref> and [ Borgefors, 1986 ] . This algorithm computes a structure that we call Near-Continuous Distance Map (NCDM). <p> presented in <ref> [ Borgefors, 1984 ] </ref> and [ Borgefors, 1986 ] . This algorithm computes a structure that we call Near-Continuous Distance Map (NCDM). Also, we provide an analysis of the accuracy of approximation introduced by NCDM relative to optimal shortest path distance, which is a generalization of results from [ Borgefors, 1984 ] .

Also, we provide an analysis of the accuracy of approximation introduced by NCDM relative to optimal shortest path distance, which is a generalization of results from [ Borgefors, 1984 ] . <p> The second important point we want to make is that paths obtained by DDMs are close to the optimal paths. According to the formula 3.1 that we will derive shortly, the algorithm from <ref> [ Borgefors, 1986 ] </ref> computes the path that is longer than optimal path by at most 2:7%. For most circumstances this can be considered an acceptable tolerance.

Reference-contexts: The reaction has to be corrective in a sense that given that piece of information a priori the planner would have come up with that (reactive) plan, yet quick enough so that the overall performance doesn't deteriorate. This idea has been explored in reactive systems <ref> [ Lyons, 1990; Brooks, 1986 ] </ref> . A reactor is the system that links sensor system with motor actuation through a network that defines a reaction. The overall system structure is given in figure 2.1 (adopted from [ Lyons, 1990 ] ).

Reference-contexts: This planning strategy is referred to as a worst-case planning since the computed plans are guaranteed to succeed under assumed conditions. There has been several attempts to generalize this planning strategy to average case (see, for example, <ref> [ Brost and Christiansen, 1993 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: We foresee using the probability as a source for constructing potential functions. Certain problems in motion planning are notoriously complex. For example, it is shown in <ref> [ Canny and Reif, 1987 ] </ref> that planning the compliant motion in 3-dimensional configuration space with the presence of uncertainty is, in general, nondeterministic-exponential time hard. <p> If the uncertainty is present in the system, in the case of the manipulation robot the proposed solution is the compliant motion, originally proposed in [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] . Its complexity has been analyzed in details and it turns out that it is very hard <ref> [ Canny and Reif, 1987 ] </ref> . Recently the kinodynamic planning received considerable attention.

Reference-contexts: The Bayesian approach assumes that each information contributes to our overall degree of belief in certain statement (as it is said in <ref> [ Cheesman, 1986 ] </ref> , "otherwise the information is not informative"). Thus, the degree of belief is tightly connected to the a priori knowledge, and without it does not make sense. <p> But, as proponents of probability theory argue, vagueness is nothing but an instance from the set of possible meanings, which means that it can be modelled by a probability distribution over that set. However, there are different opinions, like the one in <ref> [ Cheesman, 1986 ] </ref> , where the author argues the the expressiveness of the probability theory is, contrary to common belief, not inferior to the other representations of uncertainty such as possibility theory based on fuzzy sets. <p> Also, it has been proven in [ Cox, 1979 ] that the mathematically consistent representation of plausibility based on quantitative mapping of propositions into real numbers has to contain axioms of probability theory. This, according to <ref> [ Cheesman, 1986 ] </ref> , implies that fuzzy logic, being non-identical to probability theory, is necessarily not consistent.

Reference-contexts: This is an interesting phenomenon: the merger of planning and control caused planning (represented by a function U ext ) to exhibit the same weaknesses as control alone did! This behavior can be explained by a difference between computational models planning and control traditionally rely upon. As stated in <ref> [ Dean and Wellman, 1991 ] </ref> , 18 Chapter 2. Reasoning with Uncertainty : : : the standard techniques employed in these two disciplines are based on manifestly distinct forms of process models, and draw on variant terminologies and seemingly divergent technical traditions. <p> The review of the research effort in this area here is mainly based on [ Pearl, 1988 ] , [ Kanal and Lemmer, 1986 ] and <ref> [ Dean and Wellman, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The planning system has to make sure that its termination predicate is "strong" enough to prevent getting to the goal without recognizing it. The classical work in robotic planning in the presence of uncertainties has been done by Lozano-Perez and colleagues <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983; Erdmann, 1986; Donald, 1987 ] </ref> . This planning strategy is referred to as a worst-case planning since the computed plans are guaranteed to succeed under assumed conditions. <p> Some further developments are [ Donald, 1990 ] and [ Pai and Leu, 1991 ] . 2.4 Overview of Uncertainty Models There are three main sources of uncertainties in robotic systems that are recognized in the literature <ref> [ Donald, 1987 ] </ref> : * sensor uncertainty, caused by imperfection of the sensory equipment * control uncertainty, caused by an imperfection of the control system * environment uncertainty, caused by the inaccuracy of the world description at the system's disposal 1 These three types of uncertainties are also recognized by <p> The work presented in [ Davis and McDermott, 1982 ] addresses the robot navigation in the partially known environment. The tool that authors use is an approximate map of the environment. An interesting idea of "many universes" is exploited in the environment uncertainty description presented in <ref> [ Donald, 1987 ] </ref> . The configuration space C is observed as a "slice" (i.e. a subspace) of a broader generalized configuration space C fi P env where P env is, in words from [ Donald, 1987 ] , "an arbitrary index set which parameterizes the model error". <p> An interesting idea of "many universes" is exploited in the environment uncertainty description presented in <ref> [ Donald, 1987 ] </ref> . The configuration space C is observed as a "slice" (i.e. a subspace) of a broader generalized configuration space C fi P env where P env is, in words from [ Donald, 1987 ] , "an arbitrary index set which parameterizes the model error". At any given time instant the robot is in one of the "slices", although it doesn't know in which. The motion across "slices" is prohibited, since that would mean changing the geometry of the environment. <p> This statement stems from a simple fact that planning in the presence of environment uncertainty is (at least conceptually) no different then planning in many deterministic cases, indexed through the (unknown) instance of uncertain parameters that describe the environment <ref> [ Donald, 1987 ] </ref> . This is however not the case for time-varying control uncertainty, described in Chapter 5. In this chapter we will constrain ourselves only to time-constant uncertainty models.

Reference-contexts: Alternative to this is a search guided by some appropriately chosen heuristics, implemented with the well-known A* algorithm. The implementation of the A* algorithm is detailed in Section 3.6. In the deterministic setting, similar work has been reported in <ref> [ Dorst and Trovato, 1988 ] </ref> . Now that we are equipped with an efficient and accurate path planner we need to extend it so that it can handle the case of a semi-static environment, and produce paths and their time parameterizations that have certain desirable properties.

Reference-contexts: Another possible scenario is the floor of a warehouse with the objects in it having static but not completely known positions.

The lighting and coloring of obstacles is assumed to allow for unique distinction between objects and the background. <p> Detailed analysis can be found for example in [ Hager, 1991 ] . 3.2 Near-Shortest Path Planning Based on Near-Continuous Distance Maps Digital distance maps (DDMs) <ref> [ Elfes, 1987; Moravec, 1988 ] </ref> offer an attractive approach to near-real-time planning since near-optimal paths can be found efficiently from the distance map computed off-line. The first algorithm for computing DDM was proposed more than 30 years ago [ Lee, 1961 ] .

Reference-contexts: Reasoning with Uncertainty : : : the standard techniques employed in these two disciplines are based on manifestly distinct forms of process models, and draw on variant terminologies and seemingly divergent technical traditions. What are those "divergent technical traditions"? An insightful answer to this question we find in <ref> [ Hager, 1991 ] </ref> : The major difference between planning and control is their level of representation: control typically relies on a continuous state space representation, uses detailed kinematic and dynamic models developed using differential techniques, and usually develops solutions using analytic techniques. <p> caused by imperfection of the sensory equipment * control uncertainty, caused by an imperfection of the control system * environment uncertainty, caused by the inaccuracy of the world description at the system's disposal 1 These three types of uncertainties are also recognized by researchers in the area of sensor fusion <ref> [ Hager, 1991; McKendall and Mintz, 1990 ] </ref> . Sensor fusion represents a set of methodologies for information retrieval, combination, verification and decision-making. <p> Furthermore, a sensor system has to be able to cope with uncertainties present in raw sensor measurements, as well as with the "holes" in its knowledge about the environment. The sources of errors are usually categorized into the following groups (based on <ref> [ Hager, 1991 ] </ref> ): * statistical errors, due to the random noise in the measurement process. * calibration errors, due to the inaccurate values of the system's static parameters. * model errors, due to the insufficient or inaccurate environment models These sources of errors can be related to the previously <p> There is numerous literature that addresses this problem. The first question in "sensory integration" is, according to <ref> [ Hager, 1991 ] </ref> , to identify what is being observed and how accurate those observations are. <p> Characterizing the actual sensor error is a difficult and important problem that is the subject of ongoing research (see <ref> [ McKendall and Mintz, 1990; Hager, 1991; Krotkov, 1989 ] </ref> ). 2.4.2 Control Uncertainty The effects of control uncertainty will be analyzed separately from the effects of sensor uncertainty. That means that in this paragraph we will assume that there is no sensor uncertainty. <p> The exact treatment of the relation between calibration and observation errors is, in general, a difficult problem that has much literature devoted to it. Detailed analysis can be found for example in <ref> [ Hager, 1991 ] </ref> . 3.2 Near-Shortest Path Planning Based on Near-Continuous Distance Maps Digital distance maps (DDMs) [ Elfes, 1987; Moravec, 1988 ] offer an attractive approach to near-real-time planning since near-optimal paths can be found efficiently from the distance map computed off-line.

Reference-contexts: While the dimensionality of the translation group is obviously N , all we have concluded so far about the dimensionality of the rotation group is that it is less or equal then N 2 . Whitney embedding theorem <ref> [ Hirsch, 1976 ] </ref> claims that a smooth N -dimensional manifold M can be immersed 1 into R 2N . That means that SO (N ) can be immersed into R 2M , where M is the dimensionality of the manifold SO (N ). <p> Thus, SO (N ) can be immersed into R N (N+1) . A.2.2 Potential Field Planning Topological subtleties are mainly taken from <ref> [ Hirsch, 1976 ] </ref> . 1 There is a slight difference between embedding and immersion. Immersion is an injective mapping of M onto its image, while embedding is an immersion which is in addition homeomorphic.

Reference-contexts: The examples of this planning framework in applications of optimal control theory are numerous. In robotics, there have been several attempts to encompass motion planning into this framework. An example is the minimum-jerk velocity profile described in <ref> [ Hogan, 1984 ] </ref> . 1 It can be briefly summarized as follows: Find the velocity profile _ q (t) that minimizes the criterion Z T dt 3 dt (1.1) if the system moves from a given point q A to the given point q B in time T . <p> Before we elaborate on this formulation, let's make a quick comment on how mother nature deals with a similar problem. It has been recognized in the psychology literature (see for example <ref> [ Hogan, 1984; Atkeson and Hollerbach, 1985 ] </ref> ) that the time-constrained pointing movements of monkeys as well as humans follow a bell-shaped profile that is close to a solution of a minimum-jerk model.

Reference-contexts: The number of coordinates necessary to describe any point is equal to the number of DOFs. The elegant and powerful technique widely used in robot motion planning is a concept of a configuration space [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] . As stated in <ref> [ Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> , the configuration-space approach is not itself a method, but rather a representational technique that allows one to consider the entire robot as a single point in certain high-dimensional space | the configuration space. <p> An important point to mention is that most of the known planning methodologies can be expressed using the concept of a configuration space. In <ref> [ Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> we find the following insightful comment on common misunderstanding of the configuration space approach: Planning methods that have been viewed as alternatives to the "configuration space approach", such as the "potential field" methods, can be consistently and usefully described using this tool. <p> The simple (Euclidean) structure of C is the consequence of the assumption that there are no rotations of A in W. If we allow for rotations, C becomes significantly more complex. Its structure is examined in the Appendix A.2, based on the exposition in <ref> [ Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> . The topological properties of the configuration space are important for the analysis of relations between obstacles and a robot in the configuration space when their representations are given algebraically as a set of constraints. <p> The introduction of obstacles into the configuration space leads to the definition of several new concepts: free, contact and valid space, denoted C f , C c and C v respectively <ref> [ Latombe, 1991 ] </ref> . The motion in free space is called free motion and the motion in the contact space is called contact or (as we will call it henceforth) compliant motion. The compliant motion is tightly related to forces in the configuration space.

Reference-contexts: There is numerous literature that addresses this problem. The first question in "sensory integration" is, according to [ Hager, 1991 ] , to identify what is being observed and how accurate those observations are. The model of sensor uncertainty, as given in <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] </ref> , is the ball S (q 0 0 ) in the configuration space C, centered in the actual position q 0 0 and with radius " q 0 0 . <p> That means that in this paragraph we will assume that there is no sensor uncertainty. The usual model of the control uncertainty is the "uncertainty cone" <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984; Erdmann, 1986 ] </ref> . It is assumed that the effective commanded velocity v m lies inside the ball with the radius " v c centered in the desired commanded velocity v c . <p> If the uncertainty is present in the system, in the case of the manipulation robot the proposed solution is the compliant motion, originally proposed in <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] </ref> .

The elegant and powerful technique widely used in robot motion planning is a concept of a configuration space <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] </ref> . As stated in [ Latombe, 1991 ] , the configuration-space approach is not itself a method, but rather a representational technique that allows one to consider the entire robot as a single point in certain high-dimensional space | the configuration space. <p> Under certain assumptions (no rotational degrees of freedom) this is, more or less, what happens. Nonetheless, in the general case the configuration space exhibits rich and surprisingly complex structure. The configuration space has been introduced in <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] </ref> and further developed in a series of related papers. As a matter of fact, the configuration space concept formalized and put on solid theoretical ground the common assumption in path-planning literature that the robot is a free-moving point in a certain, possibly high-dimensional, space. <p> The planning system has to make sure that its termination predicate is "strong" enough to prevent getting to the goal without recognizing it. The classical work in robotic planning in the presence of uncertainties has been done by Lozano-Perez and colleagues <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983; Erdmann, 1986; Donald, 1987 ] </ref> . This planning strategy is referred to as a worst-case planning since the computed plans are guaranteed to succeed under assumed conditions. <p> A possible extension of the methods presented in the previous chapter would be as follows. We take a series of images of the environment. For each image and for a given robot we compute a discrete C space (the standard reference for the computation of the configuration space is <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] </ref> ). This discrete C space is a 3D mesh of robot's positions and orientations, sampled appropriately.

Reference-contexts: The reaction has to be corrective in a sense that given that piece of information a priori the planner would have come up with that (reactive) plan, yet quick enough so that the overall performance doesn't deteriorate. This idea has been explored in reactive systems <ref> [ Lyons, 1990; Brooks, 1986 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: importance of examining the mapping of forces from W into C is twofold: firstly, the potential field method, described in the next section, uses artificial potentials in the configuration space for navigating the robot among obstacles, and secondly, and more importantly, the special kind of motion control | compliant motion <ref> [ Mason, 1981 ] </ref> | is commonly used in uncertain environments for guiding the robot towards the goal. Originally the control problem in robotics was to maintain the prescribed trajectory in the configuration space.

Sensor fusion represents a set of methodologies for information retrieval, combination, verification and decision-making. <p> Characterizing the actual sensor error is a difficult and important problem that is the subject of ongoing research (see <ref> [ McKendall and Mintz, 1990; Hager, 1991; Krotkov, 1989 ] </ref> ). 2.4.2 Control Uncertainty The effects of control uncertainty will be analyzed separately from the effects of sensor uncertainty. That means that in this paragraph we will assume that there is no sensor uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Another possible scenario is the floor of a warehouse with the objects in it having static but not completely known positions. The model of a semi-static environment will be the widely used concept of an occupancy grid <ref> [ Elfes, 1987; Moravec, 1988 ] </ref> , obtained by averaging a series of images of the 2D workspace from an overhead camera. The lighting and coloring of obstacles is assumed to allow for unique distinction between objects and the background. <p> Detailed analysis can be found for example in [ Hager, 1991 ] . 3.2 Near-Shortest Path Planning Based on Near-Continuous Distance Maps Digital distance maps (DDMs) <ref> [ Elfes, 1987; Moravec, 1988 ] </ref> offer an attractive approach to near-real-time planning since near-optimal paths can be found efficiently from the distance map computed off-line. The first algorithm for computing DDM was proposed more than 30 years ago [ Lee, 1961 ] .

Reference-contexts: 5.1 in the form dq m = v c dt + dq (5.2) The velocity noise v can be thought of as a time derivative of a position noise v = dq=dt, under certain measurability assumptions from the theory of SDEs that assure that this derivation is well defined. (see <ref> [ Oksendal, 1989 ] </ref> for details). It is the noise q that we want to model using a SDE. The most general form of a SDE that models q, written in the differential form, is [ Oksendal, 1989 ] : dq = A (t; q)dt + (t; q)dW (5.3) where W <p> assumptions from the theory of SDEs that assure that this derivation is well defined. (see <ref> [ Oksendal, 1989 ] </ref> for details). It is the noise q that we want to model using a SDE. The most general form of a SDE that models q, written in the differential form, is [ Oksendal, 1989 ] : dq = A (t; q)dt + (t; q)dW (5.3) where W is a random Wiener process, A is certain vector-valued function and is certain matrix-valued function. These two functions, in general, depend on the time t and the noise q. <p> I 0 is the modified Bessel function of zeroth order. A graph of s (s) is given in figure 5.22. Here s 0 is fixed to 1 and varies from 0.4 to 1.0. It is shown in <ref> [ Oksendal, 1989 ] </ref> that the random process whose solution is a random variable with the density s can be modeled by a SDE of the form sds = 2 " 0 W y d W x # where W x and W y are two independent Wiener processes. <p> This process is called 2-dimensional Bessel process since the related Kolmogorov equation contains the Bessel differential operator in s. The detail analysis of this process can be found in <ref> [ Oksendal, 1989 ] </ref> . However, we need to comment on the form of this SDE. It is non-linear and thus not in the form 5.5. The estimation of the parameter is done on-line during tracking and is incorporated into the filtering scheme of the tracking system.

Reference-contexts: The examples are Dempster-Shafer theory, truth-maintenance systems and incidence calculus. The common idea in those methodologies is computing probabilities of provabilities of propositions rather then probabilities of truth. For the introduction to these methodologies, as well as further references, see <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . 2.2.1 Probabilistic Modeling in Artificial Intelligence There is an impressive body of work done in AI that deals with the representation and manipulation of uncertain knowledge. The review of the research effort in this area here is mainly based on [ Pearl, 1988 ] , [ <p> well as further references, see <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . 2.2.1 Probabilistic Modeling in Artificial Intelligence There is an impressive body of work done in AI that deals with the representation and manipulation of uncertain knowledge. The review of the research effort in this area here is mainly based on [ Pearl, 1988 ] , [ Kanal and Lemmer, 1986 ] and [ Dean and Wellman, 1991 ] . According to [ Bhatnager and Kanal, 1986 ] , the deficiency of information allowable to the system is considered uncertain in several different aspects. <p> Classical logic as a powerful apparatus for calculating ("inferring" as it is usually said in AI) new knowledge from the existing one unfortunately falls apart when it comes to dealing with uncertainty <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . Due to the breakdown of modularity of inference, the truth value of "A implies B" cannot be deduced only from the truth values of "A" and "B". There is a need for more elaborate techniques for truth value manipulations, such as probability theory. <p> In general, there are two strategies for dealing with the uncertainty. They are commonly referred to as the "extensional" and the "intentional" strategy. In the extensional systems, as they are defined in <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> , : : : the certainty of the formula is defined to be a unique function of the certainties of its subformulas. (: : : ) For example, the certainty of the conjunction 2.3 Planning Methodologies 21 A^B is given by some function (e.g., the minimum or

Reference-contexts: Theoretically, for an appropriately chosen metric tensor g ij this would be a solution of the problem since we know boundary conditions 3.7 and 3.8. The problem is that numerical methods for solving two point boundary value problems, such as a "shooting" method <ref> [ Press et al., 1988 ] </ref> , are numerically unstable. <p> In addition, there is a theoretical investigation that indicates that this problem is computationally intractable (see [ Fraichard and Laugier, 1993 ] ). Another method for solving two point boundary value problems, the relaxation method <ref> [ Keller, 1976; Press et al., 1988 ] </ref> , is based on the idea of throwing a grid over the space in which the equation in question is being integrated, and substituting the differential equation with related finite difference equation. <p> Now the integral 6.1 can be written as m succ = 1 Z succ (q + Kq 0 )dq 0 (A.57) Now, the Gauss-Hermite method can be directly applied (see <ref> [ Press et al., 1988 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: In order to determine the parameter ` we will equip the map of an environment with the structure of a quad tree <ref> [ Samet, 1984 ] </ref> . A quad tree is a member of a family of structures called 2 m -trees for m = 2. These structures are used for tessellation of an m-dimensional space into m-dimensional cubes 7 . <p> Since we are interested in a 2D space we will henceforth concentrate on quad trees only. A quad tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows an efficient representation of a 2D space in a form of a tree data structure. In its original definition, as given in <ref> [ Samet, 1984 ] </ref> , each node in a tree is a leaf or a non-leaf, each non-leaf has exactly four sons, named NW, NE, SW, SE (for north-west, etc.), and each leaf is said to be either BLACK, if corresponding set of pixels entirely belongs to an object in an

The mathematical representation of this "history" is the time integration operator.

Reference-contexts: Although the rationale behind the potential field approach is "physical", its very nature is nonetheless a search heuristic. The planning methodologies such as Voronoi diagrams [ O'Dunlaing and Yap, 1982; O'Dunlaing et al., 1983 ] and cell decomposition <ref> [ Schwartz et al., 1987 ] </ref> , often referred to as "global", are based on graph searches. The steepest descent method employed in the potential field approach is essentially nothing but a powerful search heuristics that chooses a "preferred" direction to search for the solution. <p> Here, the motion planning is categorized based on the presence of the uncertainty, as well as based on the type of constraints imposed on the planner (kinematic and dynamic). The first in this hierarchy, the piano movers problem, is very well understood <ref> [ Schwartz et al., 1987 ] </ref> , both in terms of the completeness and the complexity of proposed algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The combination of a motion plan with guidance based on sensory readings is usually referred to as a motion strategy that generates fine motions.

Namely, due to the sensing inaccuracies, the robot may not be able to recognize that the goal has been attained.

Knowing the robot's uncertainty allows us to wisely utilize the available resources and to understand what and how well the robot can perform. On the philosophical side, this quotation from <ref> [ Smithson, 1988 ] </ref> puts uncertainty in a very different perspective, giving it the importance that we may otherwise overlook: The claim that complete knowledge of the universe entails determinism, thereby robbing people of freedom of action, is perhaps the highest valuation of ignorance (: : : ) Freedom, after all,

Reference-contexts: As a part of this research we have also examined the control uncertainty in manipulation robots during the compliant motion tasks. However, the results that we have obtained assured us that the control uncertainty that is present in this type of systems is very little (see <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1992 ] </ref> and [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] ) and that other types of uncertainties, predominantly the environment uncertainty, have much bigger effects to the system. <p> The application of ideas presented here to manipulaton tasks can be found in <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1992 ] </ref> , [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] and [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993b ] .

Reference-contexts: Another new avenue that we want to explore in this chapter is a possibility of computing the orientation of a robot in a given point in space, instead of searching through a (discretized) space of possible orientations. This is a new idea, outlined for the first time in <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] </ref> . Its main impact is that the search space has lower dimensionality (2 instead of 3 as in traditional position fi orientation search space). Experiments shown here demonstrate applicability of this method to motion planning in 2D. <p> This optimal orientation can be found through various search techniques. An alternative approach is to take advantage of the fact that succ is periodic in and to look for the maximum of the first harmonic of its Fourier series expansion. This idea has been presented in <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] </ref> for the peg insertion problem. For the sake of simplicity we will assume that the period of succ is 2, i.e. that the robot does not have any axes of symmetry. The extension for symmetrical robots is straightforward and can be easily derived. <p> However, the results that we have obtained assured us that the control uncertainty that is present in this type of systems is very little (see [ Timcenko and Allen, 1992 ] and <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] </ref> ) and that other types of uncertainties, predominantly the environment uncertainty, have much bigger effects to the system. <p> The application of ideas presented here to manipulaton tasks can be found in [ Timcenko and Allen, 1992 ] , <ref> [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993a ] </ref> and [ Timcenko and Allen, 1993b ] .
