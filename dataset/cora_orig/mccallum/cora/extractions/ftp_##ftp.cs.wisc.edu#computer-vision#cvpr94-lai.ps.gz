Abstract: This paper considers the problem of modeling and extracting arbitrary deformable contours from noisy images. We propose a global contour model based on a stable and regenerative shape matrix, which is invariant and unique under rigid motions. Combined with Markov random field to model local deformations, this yields prior distribution that exerts influence over a global model while allowing for deformations. We then cast the problem of extraction into posterior estimation and show its equivalence to energy minimization of a generalized active contour model. We discuss pertinent issues in shape training, minimax regularization and initialization by generalized Hough transform. Finally, we present experimental results and compare its performance to rigid template matching.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Without a contour model, contour extraction from noisy image is an ill-posed problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore, it is crucial for an extraction method to allow the incorporation of global contour models in its formulation. For generality, the model should be capable of representing any arbitrary shape. A well known example is the generalized Hough transform [2] which combines modeling and extraction for rigid contours. <p> Solving for MAP estimation and ignoring constants, we have fU map ; g map g U;g i=1 E int (u i ) i E ext (u i ; g) = arg min n X 1 i where i = + 2 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (19) are the local regularization parameters which control the amount of local template deformation. The formulation in (19) is analogous to the active contour models (snakes) [3]. However, the original E int only constrains the solution to the class of controlled continuity splines. <p> The experiment uses synthesized images containing deformed rectangles as shown in Figure 6 (a). We deform the boundary on each of the 4 sides independently using a randomly generated cosine function. Let b (s) represents an undeformed boundary indexed by s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The deformed boundary d (s) is given by: d (s) = b (s) + cos (s + ) (25) where - : N (0; 2 -) is a normally distributed boundary deformation process and is a random phase shift uniformly distributed in [0; 2).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is crucial for an extraction method to allow the incorporation of global contour models in its formulation. For generality, the model should be capable of representing any arbitrary shape. A well known example is the generalized Hough transform <ref> [2] </ref> which combines modeling and extraction for rigid contours. Because GHT works by accumulating large number of votes, it is relatively insensitive to small vote fluctuation caused by noise and occlusion. <p> In the same token, contours that may be determin istically deformed have the following ML estimates: f g; Tg = arg max max n X h T where the estimated contour U = TU. The correlation can be efficiently implemented using generalized Hough transforms <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that the computation cost required in (15) depends greatly on the range and resolution of T. For example, if one expects the contours to be scaled and rotated, then the range of T should span the two operations.
