Abstract: We describe our experience with a new algorithm for the reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized sample points in IR 3 . The algorithm is the first for this problem with provable guarantees. Given a good sample from a smooth surface, the output is guaranteed to be topologically correct and convergent to the original surface as the sampling density increases. The definition of a good sample is itself interesting: the required sampling density varies locally, rigorously capturing the intuitive notion that featureless areas can be reconstructed from fewer samples. The output mesh interpolates, rather than approximates, the input points. Our algorithm is based on the three-dimensional Voronoi diagram. Given a good program for this fundamental subroutine, the algorithm is quite easy to implement.

Reference-contexts: In two dimensions, there are a number of recent theoretical results on various Delaunay-based approaches to reconstructing smooth curves. Attali [3], Bernar-dini and Bajaj [5], Figueiredo and Miranda Gomes [11] and ourselves <ref> [1] </ref> have all given guarantees for different algorithms. A fundamentally different approach to reconstruction is to use the input points to define a signed distance function on IR 3 , and then polygonalize its zero-set to create the output mesh. Such zero-set algorithms produce approximating, rather than interpolating, meshes. <p> We discuss a heuristic approach to resolving sharp edges in Section 6, and propose a stronger theoretical approach in Section 7. 4 The crust algorithm 4.1 Two Dimensions We begin with a two-dimensional version of the algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. In this case, the crust will be a graph on the set of sample points S. <p> We define the crust as follows: an edge e belongs to the crust if e has a circumcircle empty not only of all other sample points but also of all Voronoi vertices of S. The crust obeys the following theorem <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 1. The crust of an r-sample from a smooth curve F , for r :25, connects only adjacent sample points on F . The medial axis provides the intuition behind this theorem.

Reference-contexts: The problem formulation above is incomplete, since presumably we should require some relationship between the input and the output. In this and a companion paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we describe a simple, combinatorial algorithm for which we can prove such a relationship. <p> All vertices of crust triangles are sample points; in fact, all crust triangles appear in the Delaunay triangulation of the sample points. The companion paper <ref> [2] </ref> presents our theoretical results. In that paper, we prove that given a good sample from a smooth surface, the output of our reconstruction algorithm is topologically equivalent to the surface, and that as the sampling density increases, the output converges to the surface, both pointwise and in surface normal. <p> The constant of proportionality r is generally less than one. In the companion paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we prove our theorems for small values of r such as r :06, but the bounds are not tight. Hence the theoretical results apply only when the sampling is very dense. We observe that in practice r = :5 generally suffices. <p> Near the medial axis, other samples on F become closer than s, and V s is cut off. This guarantees that some vertices of V s lie near the medial axis. We give a precise and quantitative version of this rough argument in <ref> [2] </ref>. This leads to the following algorithm. Instead of using all of the Voronoi vertices in the Voronoi filtering step, for each sample s we use only the two vertices of V s farthest from s, one on either side of the surface F . <p> The output of this algorithm, the three-dimensional crust, is a set of triangles that resembles the input surface geometrically. More precisely, we prove the following theorem <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 2. Let S be an r-sample from a smooth surface F , for r :06. <p> In fact, whatever the sampling density, the algorithm above may output some very thin crust triangles nearly perpendicular to the surface. We have an important lemma <ref> [2] </ref>, however, which states that the vectors n + + from a sample point to its poles are guaranteed to be nearly orthogonal to the surface at s. The angular error is linear in r. <p> We can use these vectors in an additional normal filtering step, throwing out any triangles whose normals differ too much from n + . When normal filtering is used, the normals of the output triangles approach the surface normals as the sampling density increases. We prove in <ref> [2] </ref> that the remaining set of triangles still contains a subset forming a piecewise-linear surface homeomorphic to F . normal filtering step is needed to separate the two connected components (right), which are undersampled at their closest point.

Hull uses an incremental algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>, so the running time is sensitive to the input order of the vertices. The triangulation algorithm builds a search structure concurrently with the triangulation itself; the process is analogous to sorting by incrementally building a binary search tree.

Reference-contexts: Such zero-set algorithms produce approximating, rather than interpolating, meshes. This approach was taken by Hoppe et al. [14, 13] and more recently by Curless and Levoy <ref> [8] </ref>. Hoppe et al. determine an approximate tangent plane at each sample point using least squares on k nearest neighbors, and then take the signed distance to the nearest point's tangent plane as the distance function on IR 3 . <p> The Voronoi-based estimate has the advantage that it is not sensitive to the distribution; whereas, for instance, on medical image data, all k nearest neighbors might lie in the same slice, and so would the estimated tangent plane. In the algorithm of Curless and Levoy <ref> [8] </ref>, the Voronoi-based estimate could be checked against the bounds on normal direction derived from the laser-range scanner. 4.4 Manifold Extraction After the normal filtering step, all the remaining triangles are roughly parallel to the surface.

Reference-contexts: We focus on the first step, and in particular on an abstract problem defined by Hoppe, DeRose, Duchamp, McDonald, and Stuet-zle <ref> [14] </ref>. In this formulation, the input is a set of points in IR 3 , without any additional structure or organization, and the desired output is a polygonal mesh, possibly with boundary. <p> A fundamentally different approach to reconstruction is to use the input points to define a signed distance function on IR 3 , and then polygonalize its zero-set to create the output mesh. Such zero-set algorithms produce approximating, rather than interpolating, meshes. This approach was taken by Hoppe et al. <ref> [14, 13] </ref> and more recently by Curless and Levoy [8]. Hoppe et al. determine an approximate tangent plane at each sample point using least squares on k nearest neighbors, and then take the signed distance to the nearest point's tangent plane as the distance function on IR 3 . <p> We note that n + , our Voronoi-based estimates of normal direction, could be useful in the zero-set reconstruction methods, which depend on accurate estimation of the tangent planes. For the algorithm of Hoppe et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, a Voronoi-based estimate could replace the estimate based on the k-nearest neighbors.

Reference-contexts: We believe, however, that there is a Voronoi-based algorithm, perhaps combining aspects of crusts and ff-shapes, that reconstructs noisy data into a thickened surface containing all the input points, some of them possibly in the interior. See Melkemi <ref> [15] </ref> for some suggestive experimental work in IR 2 7.2 Sharp Edges and Boundaries We would like to modify the crust algorithm to handle surfaces with sharp edges and to provide theoretical guarantees for the reconstruction of both sharp edges and boundaries.

Reference-contexts: These differences might be encoded efficiently using some geometrically defined measure of likelihood on Delaunay triangles. The vertices themselves could then be ordered so as to optimize properties such as compressibility or progressive reconstruction by an incremental algorithm. With the current best geometry compression method <ref> [16] </ref>, most of the bits are already used to encode the vertex positions, rather than connectivity, but the connectivity is encoded in the ordering of the vertices. Allowing arbitrary vertex orderings could improve compression; we are experimenting with an octree encoding.
