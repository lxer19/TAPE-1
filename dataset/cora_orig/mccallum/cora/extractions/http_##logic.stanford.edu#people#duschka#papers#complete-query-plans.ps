Title: Generating Complete Query Plans Given Approximate Descriptions of Content Providers

Abstract: Information brokers can use information available from content providers to answer complex user queries. To accomplish this task they need descriptions of the domains of content providers. Domains can often be described only approximately by giving lower and upper bounds on the data available, because exact descriptions might be too complex and inefficient to deal with. This paper presents an algorithm to generate query plans for an information broker given only approximate descriptions. The algorithm guarantees completeness, meaning that all information available from content providers and requested by the user will be retrieved. Furthermore, the algorithm selects the minimum number of content providers which guarantees completeness given only approximate descriptions.

Reference-contexts: It is straightforward to generalize this to the situation where one content provider charges more than another. Several architectures implement information brokers, e.g. the "Information Manifold" [KLSS95], the "TSIMMIS" project [CGH + 94], the information mediator "SIMS" <ref> [ACH + 94] </ref>, and the virtual information system "Infomaster" [GGKS95]. The latter applies the techniques presented in this paper. 1.1 Horizontal & vertical fragmenta tion In this paper, information brokers are assumed to present a single relation to the user. The relation can be considered a universal relation.

Reference-contexts: CP 1 is queried, and then determines a maximal query plan of the remaining information, i.e. CP 2 and CP 3 are queried. Since querying CP 2 and CP 3 alone would guarantee completeness, this algorithm does not query a minimal number of content providers. Several approaches ([LMSS95], [RSU95], <ref> [CKPS95] </ref>) suggest describing content providers by views, and rewriting queries using those views. Views, however, cannot express approximate descriptions. Moreover, in order to handle verti cal fragmentation, lossless reconstructions must be stated explicitly, which leads to an exponential increase in the number of descriptions.

(ii) GenQueryPlan queries the minimum number of content providers guaranteeing com pleteness given only approximate descriptions. 5 Related work In the Information Manifold <ref> [KLSS95] </ref> query plans are generated using optimistic descriptions of content providers. To reduce the number of content providers queried without losing complete ness, it can be expressed that content providers CP i 1 ; . . . ; CP i k together store all available information in some domain d. <p> Our approach includes this as a special case, since the same fact follows from the observation that d is included in d i 1 _ . . ._ d i k . Moreover, the algorithm presented in <ref> [KLSS95] </ref> doesn't guarantee minimality, as can be seen from the following example: Assume content providers CP 1 , CP 2 and CP 3 can answer queries on relation R with attributes A 1 and A 2 .

Reference-contexts: Every algorithm that is able to decide whether a decomposition is lossless may be used here. Liu and Demers <ref> [LD80] </ref> provide an algorithm for testing losslessness of decompositions that has cubic time complexity. This algorithm is more general than is required here, since arbitrary functional dependencies can be given instead of just keys.

Reference-contexts: The relation can be considered a universal relation. This has the advantage that users don't have to know which attributes are grouped with which in a relation scheme. See <ref> [U89] </ref> for motivation for using universal relations as a user interface. A different viewpoint is to consider this relation as the atomic case of arbitrary queries.

Reference-contexts: R 2 = fhb; ci; hb; eig. Joining R 1 and R 2 yields fha; b; ci; ha; b; ei; hd; b; ci; hd; b; eig which is a proper superset of R. Spurious tuples can be avoided, as noticed in <ref> [YL87] </ref>, by requiring that every back-join is over a key of R. Let K be the set of keys of R.
