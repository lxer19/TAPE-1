Abstract: Both in Kripke's Theory of Truth ktt [8] and Russell's Ramified Type Theory rtt [16, 9] we are confronted with some hierarchy. In rtt, we have a double hierarchy of orders and types. That is, the class of propositions is divided into different orders where a propositional function can only depend on objects of lower orders and types. Kripke on the other hand, has a ladder of languages where the truth of a proposition in language L n can only be made in L m where m &gt; n. Kripke finds a fixed point for his hierarchy (something Russell does not attempt to do). We investigate in this paper the similarities of both hierarchies: At level n of ktt the truth or falsehood of all order-n-propositions of rtt can be established. Moreover, there are order-n-propositions that get a truth value at an earlier stage in ktt. Furthermore, we show that rtt is more restrictive than ktt, as some type restrictions are not needed in ktt and more formulas can be expressed in the latter. Looking back at the double hierarchy of Russell, Ramsey [11], and Hilbert and Ackermann [7] considered the orders to cause the restrictiveness, and therefore removed them. This removal resulted in Church's Simple Type Theory stt [1]. We show however that orders in rtt correspond to levels of truth in ktt. Hence, ktt can be regarded as the dual of stt where types have been removed and orders are maintained. As rtt is more restrictive than ktt, we can conclude that it is the combination of types and orders that was the restrictive factor in rtt.

Reference-contexts: NaDSet 1 is a theory of generalized abstraction which makes n-ary predication a primitive of the system, with the unary truth predicate being trivially definable upon this basis. For a useful connection between ktt and NaDSet 1, see <ref> [4] </ref>. Remark 4.6 The extensions suggested above are of a mere technical character. Therefore, we think that we can still speak of an embedding of rtt within ktt.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The role of Type Theory in Logic and Mathematics has always been a restrictive one. The need for restrictions was realised at the beginning of this century, when Bertrand Russell showed that Frege's "Begriffschrift" <ref> [5] </ref>, a formalisation of logic, was inconsistent 1 . Russell considered self-application to be the cause of the contradictions, and hence excluded all possibilities of self-application in his Theory of Types [13, 16].

Reference-contexts: That is, Lemma 4.8 helps us in showing that ktt can be regarded as a system based on rtt of which the types and not the orders have been removed. 1 An English translation of Russell's letter to Frege in which this inconsistency is described can be found in <ref> [6] </ref> 2 2a Propositional Functions In this section we shall describe the set of propositions and propositional functions which Whitehead and Russell use in "Principia". We give a modernised, formal definition which corresponds to the description in "Principia".

Reference-contexts: In 1925, Ramsey [11] shows that, by making distinction between language and meta-language, the orders can be removed from the system without re-introducing any known paradox. Hilbert and Ackermann <ref> [7] </ref> present a similar idea. With this remark the type-theoretic fundaments for the Simple Theory of Types stt, introduced by Church [1] in 1940, were laid, and orders have remained out of the important modern type systems up till now. <p> We conclude, as so often has been concluded in Logic, in Mathematics and in Natural Language, that Russell's Theory of Types is too restrictive. However, the usual objections against rtt in Logic and Mathematics is the use of orders. After Ramsey [11] and Hilbert and Ackerman <ref> [7] </ref> had given motivations for leaving out these orders, they have hardly been used anywhere in logic or mathematics (though Weyl [15] has tried to give a build-up of mathematics within rtt). Here the situation is completely different.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, he distinguishes between (object-) language and meta-language and allows the truth predicate only at the meta-level. Now, to talk about the truth of sentences in the meta-language, one needs a meta-meta-language and so on. Kripke <ref> [8] </ref>, however, considers Russell's Theory of Types and the Theory of Truth by Tarski to be too restrictive for a proper formalisation of Natural Language and presents a type-free theory where the truth predicate belongs to the language, in which nevertheless the known paradoxes do not occur. <p> This is faithful to Russell, for whom the Tarskian notion of an uninterpreted formal language was quite alien. 3 Kripke's Theory of Truth ktt In this section, we shortly describe Kripke's Theory of Truth ktt (see <ref> [8] </ref>). Kripke expresses higher-order formulas within a first-order language, using the fact that many interesting languages are rich enough to express their own syntax (for instance, via a Godel Numbering).

Reference-contexts: We start this paper by presenting an overview of both Russell's system (in Section 2, using a formalisation presented in <ref> [9] </ref>) and Kripke's (in Section 3). In Section 4 we carefully compare both theories. As Russell's system is said to be more restrictive than Kripke's, this comparison is carried out by coding Russell's expressions in Kripke's theory. <p> An extended philosophical motivation for this theory can be found in "Principia Mathematica" [16], pages 38-55. We will not go into the full details of the formalisation of Russell's theory (these details can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>, the presentation by Russell himself in "Principia" is informal). In Subsection 2a we introduce propositional functions, the logical formulas of the "naive" system of logic. In Subsection 2b we present a rule to assign a type to some of these propositional functions. <p> Nevertheless, it is hard and elaborate to give a proper definition of substitution. We present a short overview of this definition in Subsection 2c; for a motivation of this definition and its relation to fi-reduction in the -calculus the reader should consult <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 We use ; to range over contexts and t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : to range over types. We now present a set of typing rules for rtt. These rules are derived from and equivalent to the rules in [9], which are as close as possible <p> the -calculus the reader should consult <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 We use ; to range over contexts and t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : to range over types. We now present a set of typing rules for rtt. These rules are derived from and equivalent to the rules in [9], which are as close as possible to Russell's original ideas. We change our notation for propositional functions slightly: Instead of 8x [f ] we write 8x:t [f ], where t is some ramified type. <p> As is a context, we have u j u 0 , hence u j (u) a1 , which is impossible. An important result is the following (a proof can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>): Theorem 2.8 (Unicity of Types) If ` f : t and ` f : u then t j u. 2 2c Substitution in rtt Substitution in rtt is not simply a syntactic operation of replacing a variable by an object, as is usual in first-order logic. <p> Below, we give a formal definition of substitution in rtt (needed in the proof of the Substitution Lemma 4.8). For examples and an extended motivation of the definition the reader may consult <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> Notice, however, that k p (h 0 1 ; : : : ; h 0 not a propositional function (see the explanation in Subsection 2a). More on the relation between substitution in rtt and fi-reduction in -calculus can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. We give some examples of rtt-style substitutions in order to make the reader more familiar with this notion. Example 2.10 * R (x 1 ; x 2 )[x 1 :=a 1 ] = R (a 1 ; x 2 ). <p> Similarly, this new substitution first leads to (R (x 1 ))(a)[z 2 :=R (x 1 )] and then to R (x 1 )[x 1 :=a]. 6 We will need the following results about substitutions. They are proved in <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As paradoxical sentences in Natural Language play a role similar to that of the paradoxes in Logic and Mathematics, Type Theory eliminated the paradoxical sentences (see for instance <ref> [10] </ref>). Paradoxes moreover have been classified in two categories (see [11]): the logical and the semantical. The famous Russell's paradox is logical whereas the famous liar's paradox is semantical. The semantical paradoxes usually involve the truth predicate T which gives the truth value of a proposition.
