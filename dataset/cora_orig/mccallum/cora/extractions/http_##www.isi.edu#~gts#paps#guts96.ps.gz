Abstract: Increasingly large numbers of people communicate today via electronic means such as email or news forums. One of the basic properties of the current electronic communication means is the identification of the end-points. However, at times it is desirable or even critical to hide the identity and/or whereabouts of the end-points (e.g., human users) involved. This paper discusses the goals and desired properties of anonymous email in general and introduces the design and salient features of Babel anonymous remailer. Babel allows email users to converse electronically while remaining anonymous with respect to each other and to other even hostile - parties. A range of attacks and corresponding countermeasures is considered. An attempt is made to formalize and quantify certain dimensions of anonymity and untraceable communication.

Reference-contexts: Section 7 presents an attempt to quantify some measures of anonymity. Finally, Section 8 de scribes the salient implementation issues. 2 Motivation It is no surprise that untraceable communication is a highly-charged and, at times, even controversial, topic <ref> [1, 18, 22, 23] </ref>. Anonymous email is an anathema to some people. This reputation is due largely to the possible abuses of anonymity for the purposes of spreading libelous accusations, hate-filled propaganda, pornography and other unpleasant content. At the same time, anonymous mail has its legitimate and benign uses.

Reference-contexts: In brief, our approach is based on a special entity called a "mix". The concept of a mix was first introduced by Chaum <ref> [2] </ref> in the early eighties. A mix can be viewed as a logical component (e.g., application layer software) that forwards email messages and in the process obfuscates the relationship between incoming and outgoing message traffic. The paper is organized as follows. <p> Drawing a boundary between use and abuse of technology is a complicated philosophical matter; it is not treated in this paper. 2.1 Previous work The first and the most authoritative paper to-date dealing with anonymous communication was published by D. Chaum in 1981 <ref> [2] </ref>. The Babel remailer described in this report owes much to his ideas. Chaum also invented the DC-network [4] which provides unconditional untraceability commensurate with high bandwidth overhead. <p> Eve is also able to generate spurious messages. A mix functions according to the following principle <ref> [2] </ref>. Suppose Alice wishes to send message M to Bob anonymously. She submits a specially composed message I to the mix. I includes M and Bob's network address. It is intelligible only to the mix. A transformed version of I, called O, is forwarded by the mix to Bob. <p> This is discussed in the following sections. 3.1.2 Time correlation Obviously, there is a strong causal relationship between the incoming and outgoing messages. This relationship can be exploited by Eve. One simple solution is to output messages in batches, as outlined in <ref> [2] </ref>. In this scheme, at least N input messages are accumulated before being forwarded in random order. N is called the minimum batch size. We refer to this scheme as normal or regular batching. <p> As an incoming message I results in the same output O when replayed, associating the two is trivial. Because of its simplicity, message replay is an extremely serious threat. It is possible to prevent replay by keeping track of incoming messages and discarding replays <ref> [2] </ref>. Replay detection is a well-studied topic [8, 9]. Basic techniques consist of using sequence numbers, random numbers (nonces) or data and time stamps. Techniques involving sequence numbers or nonces imply at least some synchronization. However, there is an inherent contradiction between the terms synchronization and anonymity. <p> As mentioned earlier, if only a single mix is used, that mix is trusted to withhold critical information. Instead of trusting a single mix, Alice may decide to use a series of mixes to forward her message to Bob <ref> [2] </ref>, see Figure 2. The system thus becomes more secure. Eve's task becomes significantly more difficult. In fact, in order to link the message sent by Alice to the message received by Bob, Eve has to subvert/defeat the mixes on the path. <p> Most of the material (with few exceptions) presented in this section is due to Chaum <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>. For the sake of clarity, we assume (for the time being) that cryptographic operations (encryption/decryption) have no impact on message size. <p> Successive decryptions of Y r with these keys yield M'. We note that in Chaum's model <ref> [2] </ref>, Alice has to remember the keys K 1 ; K 2 ; : : : ; K r , in order to process the reply. <p> However, if the mixes on the deviated path further detoured messages, endless detour loops would occur. To avoid this problem, detoured messages would have to be tagged accordingly. An important benefit that can be derived from detouring forward-bound messages is that, unlike Chaum's mixes <ref> [2] </ref>, we can guarantee that even the originator of an anonymous message can not recognize its own message as it leaves a mix. <p> In a similar fashion, the last hop can deduce that it is the last. However, all others, i.e. intermediate hops, should not know the number of preceding hops nor the number of following ones. Chaum <ref> [2] </ref> presents a general solution where data is divided into a fixed number of fixed-size blocks. This is the solution implemented in the Mixmaster package [7]. Here we present another approach that is simpler and more storage-efficient.

Reference-contexts: A remarkably simple and efficient conversion method is radix-64 ar-moring. It is defined in [16]. 8.3 Remailer deployment A Babel mix is designed to act as a filter installed in the .forward file. Refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for further information on email filters. Any user can transform his computer account into an anonymous remailer in a matter of minutes, without having any administrator privileges. Personal email is treated as usual, but anonymous mail is filtered and processed without ever cluttering the user's mailbox 20 .

Reference-contexts: Although they share the same code base, each differs in minor ways; some allow posting to newsgroups while others do not, some do not accept pgp encrypted messages; some even use different formats. Their lack of a unified modus operandi complicates their use and hinders their acceptance. The Mixmas-ter <ref> [7] </ref> remailer written by L. Cottrell is a significant step forward as it constitutes the first true mix. 2.2 Overview of desired properties We begin the technical discussion by enumerating the desired properties of anonymous mail. 1. Anyone able to send email should be able to do so anonymously. 2. <p> However, all others, i.e. intermediate hops, should not know the number of preceding hops nor the number of following ones. Chaum [2] presents a general solution where data is divided into a fixed number of fixed-size blocks. This is the solution implemented in the Mixmaster package <ref> [7] </ref>. Here we present another approach that is simpler and more storage-efficient. The basic idea is to ensure that some padding (encrypted or not) always follows information-carrying data. An example should make the point clear.

Reference-contexts: Alice scans this newsgroup for replies matching that number tag. This method is roughly analogous to the broadcast solution as described in <ref> [10] </ref>. 6 Keeping Message Sizes Constant In principle, a cryptosystem where encrypted messages are of the same length as the corresponding cleartext can be devised, e.g. CFB mode of DES with a pre-distributed initialization vector. In practice, however, ciphertext is usually somewhat longer than cleartext.

Reference-contexts: First, most of today's Internet email is not very secure. Sender authentication, non-repudiation, data integrity and privacy are some of the basic ingredients of secure email. While basic email security is addressed to some extent by recent offerings such as pgp [35] and PEM <ref> [16] </ref>, their acceptance is far from universal. Another important feature missing in current email is support for anonymity and untrace-ability of users. In the Internet milieu, it is quite unrealistic to expect any security features of the underlying network; eavesdroppers can easily record email messages and gather addressing information. <p> A remarkably simple and efficient conversion method is radix-64 ar-moring.
