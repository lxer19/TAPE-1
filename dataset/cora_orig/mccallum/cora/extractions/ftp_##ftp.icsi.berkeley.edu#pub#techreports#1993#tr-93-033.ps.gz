Abstract: The paper describes a case study that explores the idea of building a planner with a neat semantics of the plans it produces, by choosing some action formalism that is "ideal" for the planning application and building the planner accordingly. In general|and particularly so for the action formalism used in this study, which is quite expressive|this strategy is unlikely to yield fast and efficient planners if the formalism is used navely. Therefore, we adopt the idea that the planner approximates the theoretically ideal plans, where the approximation gets closer, the more run time the planner is allowed. As the particular formalism underlying our study allows a significant degree of uncertainty to be modeled and copes with the ramification problem, we end up in a planner that is functionally comparable to modern anytime uncertainty planners, yet is based on a neat formal semantics. fl An earlier version of this paper has appeared as IRISA Technical Report No. 738, 1993.

However, it is not applicable here because the independence property is not true for L c .

Reference-contexts: Among them, we select the p with maximal entropy, because this distribution assumes minimal additional information beyond K and P . The probability distribution p for the cup domain is shown in Figure 5 and can be computed following the lines given in <ref> [ Cheeseman, 1983 ] </ref> . Lacking further knowledge, it constitutes the robot's belief about the current situation of the world. It is straightforward to revise this probability distribution in order to reflect additional information about the current world situation. <p> Given the possible L-worlds, computing an approximation of p is easy and relatively efficient following the lines of <ref> [ Cheeseman, 1983 ] </ref> . Concerning the computation of the possible L-worlds resulting from the performance of an action, [ Chou and Winslett, 1991 ] describes an algorithm to do that relatively efficiently, which is, however, not used in pascale2.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, we interpret sets of worlds as disjunctions of worlds. Consider as an example the cup domain, which is inspired by <ref> [ Chrisman and Simmons, 1991 ] </ref> ; Figure 2 is meant to vivify the imagination. The task of a robot is to manipulate a cup from some position, using several actions to be detailed later. The cup can be either on the floor (onfloor) or on a table (ontable).

Reference-contexts: In fact, we will see below that considering uncertainty of this sort matches very well the anytime behavior <ref> [ Dean and Boddy, 1988 ] </ref> that emerges naturally from the requirement of correctness in the limit. The particular formalism we use is inspired by Ginsberg and Smith's [ 1988 ] , or rather by the correction of their formalism in [ Winslett, 1988 ] . <p> In fact, this is the direct analog to the now-famous anytime planners as first discussed in <ref> [ Dean and Boddy, 1988 ] </ref> ; if time is considered to be discrete, then the any-step property generalizes the anytime property. <p> To repeat pointers to related work from above, there is related work 38 A APPENDIX: MARKOV CHAIN BASICS * about anytime generation of plans <ref> [ Dean and Boddy, 1988 ] </ref> |but it does not ground the plan quality in the firm semantics provided by an action formalism; * about giving plans a formal semantics [ Lifschitz, 1987 ] |but it is ex post, hence does not help the planner designers, and does not deal with

Reference-contexts: There are in fact two ways to provide a planner with a neat formalization, or semantics. The first is the ex post way: The planner comes first, and the attempt to formalize it, later; Lifschitz's [ 1987 ] semantics of strips <ref> [ Fikes and Nilsson, 1971 ] </ref> is the most prominent example, and it also demonstrates that the planner implementors may have used implementation tricks that require a matching formalization to be more intricate than expected.

Reference-contexts: If s 2 L describes this situation, our belief that a possible L-world corresponds to the actual situation is revised using Bayesian conditioning, which can be viewed as the probabilistic counterpart of belief revision in the sense of <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988 ] </ref> . The revised probability distribution p s on L-worlds is such that p s (v) = p (vjs), where p (vjs) denotes the conditional probability of v given s.

Reference-contexts: For example, few interesting modern planners will describe actions just by preconditions and postconditions, but there will be time, a difference between preconditions and subgoals, plots, protection intervals, and others, see <ref> [ Hendler et al., 1990 ] </ref> for an overview. There are two answers to this question.

Reference-contexts: This information is then used for handling possible worlds by applying results of Nilsson's probabilistic logic <ref> [ Nilsson, 1986 ] </ref> . We describe this in Section 4.2.2. In Section 4.2.3, we transfer this probability information to plans; this is done using basic techniques from Markov chain theory and utility theory. 5 In Section 4.2.4, we finally define the particular rating functions on possible worlds plans.

Reference-contexts: Second, from the viewpoint of formalism, different features of an operator description language may well be mapped onto the same formalism feature. For example, it makes perfect sense to pragmatically differentiate between goals and preconditions in an operator in sipe <ref> [ Wilkins, 1988 ] </ref> ; however, when mapping the planner to the theory, they may both be mapped onto preconditions. The heuristic search behavior of the planner takes advantage of the difference, but this behavior is not to be mapped back onto the formalism.
