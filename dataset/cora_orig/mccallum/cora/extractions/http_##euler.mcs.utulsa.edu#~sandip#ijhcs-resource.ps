Abstract: The performance of individual agents in a group depends critically on the quality of information available to them about local and global goals and resources. In general it is assumed that the more accurate and comprehensive the available information, the better is the expected performance of the individual and the group. This conclusion can be challenged in a number of scenarios. We investigate the use of limited information by agents in choosing between one of several different options, and conclude that if agents are kept ignorant about, or they deliberately ignore, any number of options, the group can converge faster to a stable and optimal configuration. We present a probabilistic analysis that sheds light on the observed phenomenon of quicker system convergence with less global information. This analysis suggests a desirable adaptive behavior on the part of individual agents. Experiments with agents following these adaptive behavior exhibits faster convergence. We also demonstrate how a couple of coalition formation schemes can improve the rate of convergence. A variable coalition formation mechanism is found to be more effective than a static one.

Reference-contexts: Researchers have observed social trends in human societies where the populace tend to look for opportunities and search for better openings within a closed environment <ref> (Bartos, 1967) </ref>. For instance, it is obvious and practical under rational thinking to shift for greener pastures, move for better jobs with less competition, to search for resources with less utilization, etc. The self-interested nature of an individual leads to choices that are perceived to improve rewards from the environment.

Reference-contexts: In Section 7 we discuss the effectiveness of two coalition formation schemes that can further improve system performance. A discussion on the salient features of the model and possible extensions are presented in Section 8. 2 Related Work Durfee <ref> (Durfee, 1995) </ref> has argued for the use of sufficient but not complete information about its environment. But, in general, little work has been done to investigate the benefits of limiting information access by agents.

Reference-contexts: But, in general, little work has been done to investigate the benefits of limiting information access by agents. Hogg and Huberman <ref> (Hogg and Huberman, 1991) </ref> have analyzed a resource utilization problem similar to the one used here to study the effects of local decisions on group behavior (Hogg and Huberman, 1991; Kephart et al., 1989). <p> They also provide an analysis of how agents that monitor system behavior and accordingly adjust their performance can bring the system closer to a stable behavior. Hogg and Huberman <ref> (Hogg and Huberman, 1991) </ref> present a robust procedure for suppressing system oscillations using a reward mechanism based on performance. We share their motivation of achieving stability in a multiagent system when individual agents are making decisions based on self-interest.

Reference-contexts: This assumption of relying only on the current state and ignoring the effects of past history on decision making is also used in Markovian analysis <ref> (Howard, 1971) </ref>. This study attempts to verify the following conjecture: limited knowledge of the environment can be beneficial for an agent in comparison to complete global knowledge.

Reference-contexts: We believe that reducing the amount of information available to such rational decision makers can be an effective mechanism for achieving system stability <ref> (Sen et al., 1996) </ref>. The research question that we are asking is the following: Can limited local knowledge be a boon rather than a bane in a multiagent system? To investigate this issue, we use a resource utilization problem where a number of agents are distributed between several identical resources.
