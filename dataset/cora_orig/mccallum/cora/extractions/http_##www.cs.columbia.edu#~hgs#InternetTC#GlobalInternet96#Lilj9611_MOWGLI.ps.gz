Abstract: Today the World-Wide Web is the most widely used distributed application. By utilising the data services of cellular telephone systems such as the digital GSM, WWW can be brought to nomadic users. However, the characteristics of cellular telephone links differ greatly from wire-line links. The narrow bandwidth, highly variable transmission delays, and sudden disconnections create problems for many Internet applications. WWW uses the HTTP and TCP/IP protocols, which exhibit a number of usability and performance problems in wide-area mobile networks. Mowgli WWW, a WWW middleware implementation, exploits several new techniques to solve these problems. Although Mowgli WWW was initially designed for a wireless WAN environment, the techniques are also profitable in fixed networks when slow or high-latency communication links are involved.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in the data service provided by the pan-European GSM network the observed round-trip times approach one second while the effective bandwidth is only around 900 bytes per second <ref> [1] </ref>. The smaller TCP segment sizes typical in low-bandwidth environments aggravate the problem since even small requests and responses bring out the full effect of the TCP slow-start algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly true when multiple connections over a constrained link interfere with each other [6]. Although the W3 Consortium is already working on a faster HTTP protocol <ref> [2] </ref>, an efficient protocol alone will not make WWW a practical application in low-bandwidth environments. Most WWW documents are fairly small but some are extremely large. In particular, many current documents contain pictures and other attachments, the value of which is often low aside from aesthetic import.

Reference-contexts: In Mowgli WWW the user is given the opportunity to specify a maximum size for retrieved text documents and embedded images. This is a very useful feature in a low-bandwidth environment since the size distribution of WWW documents is heavy-tailed <ref> [3] </ref>. Most of the WWW document objects are fairly small in size but a small fraction of objects is quite huge.

Reference-contexts: In a separate study we found that the Internet connections between Helsinki and Toronto at these times were (on average) least crowded and busiest, respectively. Based on HTML and image size distributions reported in <ref> [4, 8] </ref>, we chose two typical test pages as the workload for our measurements (see Table 1).

Reference-contexts: The Mowgli WWW Proxy compresses document objects while sending them over the wireless link. The Mowgli WWW Agent then decompresses them as necessary before forwarding them to the WWW browser. As the generic compression algorithm we use the splay-prefix algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, which is fast and simple and can compress a stream of data on a byte-by-byte basis. Different content-type specific compression algorithms can easily be added to Mowgli WWW. Currently, we support a content-type specific GIF to JPEG image conversion.

Reference-contexts: The separation is fruitful whenever the communication path consists of both narrowband and broadband segments. In particular, we take into account the specific characteristics of the low-bandwidth wireless links by replacing the TCP/IP core protocols with a special transport service called Mowgli Data Channel Service <ref> [6] </ref>. Information retrieval is predicted to be one of the most important applications for future mobile workstations. The World-Wide Web (WWW) suffers from a number of performance problems that become especially severe coupled with those in the wireless WAN environment. <p> The performance is further degraded because the retransmission and flow-control algorithms used in the TCP protocol itself perform quite badly in wireless environments. This is particularly true when multiple connections over a constrained link interfere with each other <ref> [6] </ref>. Although the W3 Consortium is already working on a faster HTTP protocol [2], an efficient protocol alone will not make WWW a practical application in low-bandwidth environments. Most WWW documents are fairly small but some are extremely large. <p> Existing TCP/IP protocols are used between the MCH and fixed hosts. Thus the protocol software in the fixed net remains unmodified. Reliable communication between the MCH and the mobile node is provided by an efficient specialised transport service, the Mowgli Data Channel Service (MDCS) <ref> [6] </ref>. Applications on the MN and MCH access the MDCS through the Mowgli socket interface which is downwards compatible with the traditional BSD sockets. Mowgli sockets can be configured to insert specialised mediators, called agents and proxies, into the communication. <p> This ensures reasonable response times to interactive applications even if there are bandwidth-intensive activities, e.g. file transfers, going on simultaneously. Another advantage of the MDCS is improved fault-tolerance. The MDCS recovers efficiently from the sudden temporary disconnections not uncommon in cellular environments. For details, see <ref> [6] </ref>. 4. Essential Features in Mowgli WWW As depicted in Figure 1 the Mowgli WWW Agent and Proxy reside at the ends of the wireless link. They cooperate in order to fetch hypermedia documents requested by the WWW browser on the mobile node from WWW servers within the fixed network.

Reference-contexts: However, cellular telephone links have a low and variable throughput. They are also prone to sudden disconnections and are often expensive to use. These characteristics create problems for most of existing applications. In <ref> [7] </ref> we introduced the Mowgli 1 communication architecture designed to alleviate such problems. The key idea is to split the end-to-end connection into two separate parts: one over the fixed network, the other over the wireless network. <p> In addition, wireless links suffer from sudden disconnections and are often expensive to use. Thus, new fault-tolerance features, improved control over the link usage, and support for disconnected-mode operation is needed. 3. Mowgli Communication Architecture The Mowgli communication architecture introduced in <ref> [7] </ref> is designed to increase the usability, reliability, and efficiency of client-server communication between Mobile Nodes (MN) and fixed hosts.

Reference-contexts: Information retrieval is predicted to be one of the most important applications for future mobile workstations. The World-Wide Web (WWW) suffers from a number of performance problems that become especially severe coupled with those in the wireless WAN environment. In <ref> [9] </ref> we introduced several ideas to improve the performance and usability of WWW browsing in wireless WAN environment. In this paper we describe Mowgli WWW, our current implementation of the ideas, and give performance results in various communication environments. The rest of paper is organised as follows. <p> In Section 5 we present the results of our performance measurements. 2. Problems with WWW in Wireless WAN Environments The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the WorldWide Web suffers from severe performance problems in high-latency environments such as wide-area networks <ref> [9, 11] </ref>. The problems arise because the HTTP protocol requires an excessive number of round-trips between client and server: Each retrieved hypertext document involves the creation and deletion of several TCP-connections, one for each embedded document object.

Measured Performance of Mowgli WWW In performance studies we examined three different software solutions for WWW browsing over a GSM data link. The difference in software solutions is in the mediator (s) between the Web browser and server.
