Abstract: We examine the question of when a polynomial f over a commutative ring has a nontrivial functional decomposition f = g ffi h. Previous algorithms [2, 3, 1] are exponential-time in the worst case, require polynomial factorization, and only work over fields of characteristic 0. We present an O(n 2 )-time algorithm. We also show that the problem is in NC . The algorithm does not use polynomial factorization, and works over any commutative ring containing a multiplicative inverse of r. Finally, we give a new structure theorem that leads to necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for decomposibility over any field. We apply this theorem to obtain an NC algorithm for decomposing irreducible polynomials over finite fields, and a subexponential algorithm for decomposing irreducible polynomials over any field admitting efficient polynomial factorization.

Reference-contexts: Hence we will ignore this case and assume that f is separable. In Landau and Miller <ref> [11] </ref>, it was shown how to determine minimal blocks of the roots of f in polynomial time. A similar procedure can be used to determine all blocks. <p> We first use the algorithm of <ref> [11] </ref> to compute all minimal blocks and test this condition. For each block A which satisfies this condition, the coefficients of h are obtained immediately from the c s i (A), and the coefficients of g are obtained by solving the triangular linear system (1). <p> The algorithm halts when the only block left to examine is or when g is indecomposable. If there is a polynomial-time algorithm for factoring over the base field K, then the algorithm of <ref> [11] </ref> for finding a block is polynomial in the size of f . The difficulty is that there are potentially n log n blocks, and we must search through all of them to find a decomposition.
