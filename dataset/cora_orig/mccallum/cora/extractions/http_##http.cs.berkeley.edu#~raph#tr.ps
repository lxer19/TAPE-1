Abstract: This paper investigates the role of trust metrics in attack-resistant public key certification. We present an analytical framework for understanding the effectiveness of trust metrics in resisting attacks, including a characterization of the space of possible attacks. Within this framework, we establish the theoretical best case for a trust metric. Finally, we present a practical trust metric based on network flow that meets this theoretical bound.

Reference-contexts: To make the analysis tractable, this paper makes two assumptions. First, we assume that most good name/key bindings are accepted. This assumption is not always validfor high-security applications, it may be desirable to have a very restricted guest list. However, for applications such as key distribution for IP security <ref> [Atk95] </ref> and widespread secure e-mail, it is a valid assumption. In such applications, if the trust metric often rejects good name/key bindings, then either connections often fail, or else they must be established insecurely.

Reference-contexts: Almost all, however, suffer from a worrisome problem: a compromise of a single key leads to a successful attack on the entire system. For example, an attacker who gains the root key of a certification hierarchy such as PEM <ref> [Ken93] </ref> can cause anyone in the entire system to accept an arbitrary forgery (defined to be an incorrect name/key binding, inserted into the system maliciously). Recent interest in authentication systems centers on systems requiring a certain number of keys (more than one) to be compromised before a forgery is accepted.

Reference-contexts: Such a metric protects against almost any attack on fewer than d keys (Section 6). * Of previously published trust metrics, the Reiter & Stubblebine [RS97a] trust metric is close to optimal, while the Maurer trust met ric <ref> [Mau96] </ref> is easily attacked (Section 7). Another contribution of the paper is to distinguish between two different types of attacks on certification systems. The most general form of attack assumes that the attacker is capable of generating arbitrary certificates. <p> Here, shortest path is the trust metric that simply measures the length of the shortest chain from client to target. Maurer is a simplified version of the trust metric proposed by Maurer <ref> [Mau96] </ref>. Reiter & Stubblebine is the bounded vertex disjoint path metric as described in [RS97a]. Maxflow is the maximum network flow metric optimized for node attacks (Section 6). Maxflow-edge is the maximum network flow metric optimized for edge attacks (Section 6.2). <p> It is important to stress that this analysis depends on the assumption that the metric accepts most good keys. For metrics that accept only a fraction of the good keys, length bounds in metrics may be useful. An intriguing metric proposed by <ref> [Mau96] </ref> assigns probabilities to each edge and performs a randomized experiment on whether the target is reachable from the source. Maurer's paper used a different certificate format and mapping than assumed here.

Reference-contexts: For certificate graphs with large constant indegree, such an attack cannot be very successful, but for certificate graphs in which a substantial fraction of the nodes have indegree 1 (as is the case with the certificate graph stored on the PGP keyservers <ref> [McB96] </ref>), the attack can have some success. The attack only works if the attacked node has a successor v with indegree 1. The attack itself is analogous to those above. <p> To a first approximation, good trust metrics measure the indegree of the target node. Using a trust metric, then, is only effective if every accepted target has a high indegree. Thus, a trust metric is not particularly helpful on existing certificate graphs such as the PGP key database <ref> [McB96] </ref>, in which about 35% of the keys in the strongly connected subgraph have one predecessor. Each source key has the choice between rejecting a large fraction of the graph or being highly vulnerable to single key forgeries.

Reference-contexts: This model corresponds fairly closely to the PGP certificate model <ref> [PGP95] </ref> extended with introducer certificates, not present in any current implementation of PGP but proposed as a future extension. It also resembles an X.509 certification system [X509] with opaque names (as opposed to distiguished names) and cross-certification. This model is somewhat simplistic compared to real-world certification schemes.

A different trust metric based on maximum network flow was proposed in [RS97b]. To our knowledge, the idea of increasing the node capacities near the source and target of the query is new. <p> Increasing the capacities near both the source and target has a small effect on node attacks (because the metric is already close to the bound), but does greatly improve resistance to edge attacksfrom d to ffd 2 . Reiter and Stubblebine <ref> [RS97a] </ref> propose a trust metric based on counting bounded vertex-disjoint paths. In the absence of a path length bound, this trust metric is equivalent to maximum network flow with unit capacities.
