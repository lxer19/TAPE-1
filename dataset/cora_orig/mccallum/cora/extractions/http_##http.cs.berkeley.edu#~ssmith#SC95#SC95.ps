Abstract: As part of a NASA HPCC Grand Challenge project, we are designing and implementing a parallel atmospheric chemical tracer model that will be suitable for use in global simulations. To accomplish this goal, our starting point has been an atmospheric pollution model that was originally used to study pollution in the Los Angeles Basin. The model includes gas-phase and aqueous-phase chemistry, radiation, aerosol physics, advection, convection, deposition, visibility and emissions. The potential bottlenecks in the model for parallel implementation are the compute-intensive ODE solving phase with load balancing problems, and the communication-intensive advection phase. We describe the implementation and performance results on a variety of platforms, with emphasis on a detailed performance model we developed to predict performance, identify bottlenecks, guide our implementation, assess scalability, and evaluate architectures. An atmospheric chemical tracer model such as the one we describe in this paper will be one component of a larger Earth Systems Model (ESM), being developed under the direction of C. R. Mechoso of UCLA, incorporating atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, ocean dynamics, and a database and visualization system.

Reference-contexts: This involved developing a detailed performance model to predict the number of wall-clock seconds needed to simulate one day of climate as a function of GATOR/ACTM parameters, architecture parameters, data layout and algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. During the design phase of the parallel implementation, this performance model proved to be an invaluable tool in identifying potential bottlenecks, eliminating design alternatives, and giving feedback to earth scientists as to what simulations they could expect to run. <p> the ODEs in each grid cell dictates the amount of time required by the ODE solver routine for each cell. 4 3 Parallelization of GATOR/ACTM During the design of the parallel implementation of GATOR/ACTM, we evaluated several static partitioning strategies and their performance behavior for several different parallel transport frameworks <ref> [3] </ref>. This section describes the design choices we made, based on those that held the most promise for meeting the goals of an efficient and portable parallel code. One of the first decisions to be made in any parallel implementation is the type of data layout to use.

Reference-contexts: As the bulk of data movement occurs in the vertical domain, we have chosen to partition the grid cells by vertical columns, so that the vertical transport of data can occur within a processor. We implement a block-cyclic static layout, such as that described in HP Fortran <ref> [4] </ref>. This layout encompasses both block and cyclic layout alternatives, and provides a reasonable means for static load balancing.

Reference-contexts: The parallel algorithm that we have developed provides a framework for the efficient solution of the nearly tridiagonal equations, by overlapping communication and computation as much as possible. The ODE solver, which is based on an implicit Gear code <ref> [6] </ref>, solves the chemical kinetic equations. It is the most expensive routine in the system and can take up to 98% of the time on a single processor Cray C-90.

As the bulk of data movement occurs in the vertical domain, we have chosen to partition the grid cells by vertical columns, so that the vertical transport of data can occur within a processor.
