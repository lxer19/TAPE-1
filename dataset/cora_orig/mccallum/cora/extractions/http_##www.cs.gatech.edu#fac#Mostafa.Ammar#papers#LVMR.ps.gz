Abstract: Layered Video Multicast with Retransmissions (LVMR) is a system for distributing video using layered coding over the Internet. The two key contributions of the system are: (1) improving the quality of reception within each layer by retransmitting lost packets given an upper bound on recovery time and applying an adaptive playback point scheme to help achieve more successful retransmission, and (2) adapting to network congestion and heterogeneity using hierarchical rate control mechanism. This paper concentrates on the rate control aspects of LVMR. In contrast to the existing sender-based and receiver-based rate control in which the entire information about network congestion is either available at the sender (in sender-based approach) or replicated at the receivers (in receiver-based approach), the hierarchical rate control mechanism distributes the information between the sender, receivers, and some agents in the network in such a way that each entity maintains only the information relevant to itself. In addition to that, the hierarchical approach enables intelligent decisions to be made in terms of conducting concurrent experiments and choosing one of several possible experiments at any instant of time based on minimal state information at the agents in the network. Protocol details are presented in the paper together with experimental and simulation results to back our claims.

Reference-contexts: The network mechanism used for video distribution is IP-multicast, which, by virtue of using the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [D89], and a multicast routing protocol, such as, Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [D88] [DC90], Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [DEF+94] or Core-Based Tree (CBT) <ref> [BFC93] </ref>, sets up a multicast tree spanning all receivers. The multicast tree is defined by the IP-address of the sender and a Class-D IP-address of the group. Receivers can dynamically join and leave a multicast group, thereby leading to the dynamic reconfiguration of the multicast tree.

Layered Video Multicast with Retransmissions (LVMR) <ref> [LPPA97] </ref> addresses the network congestion and heterogeneity problem using layered video coding techniques by allowing each receiver to subscribe to a subset of the video layers according to its processing power and network bandwidth availability. LVMR also deploys an error recovery scheme using smart retransmission and adaptive playback point. <p> LVMR also deploys an error recovery scheme using smart retransmission and adaptive playback point.

There have been two principal approaches to address the rate control problem in video multicast: sender-initiated control [BTW94] and receiver-initiated control [MJV96]. <p> The application-control layer also includes Playback Synchronizer that adapts playback point for error recovery <ref> [LPPA97] </ref> and Hierarchical Rate Controller, which is the focus of this paper. The basic idea from the networks point of view is illustrated in Figure 1 (a). <p> We assume that SL (1) (2) (3) (4) max = 3. Note that the number of multicast flows in each subnet is indicated by the number of solid lines. 4.1 The State Transition A simplified discussion of the state transition diagram for the basic protocol can be found in <ref> [LPPA97] </ref>. Each transition in Figure 4 is associated with (1) a condition clause, (2) a send operation, (3) a receive operation, and (4) an action clause. <p> In Table 3, we have used three "conditions:" (1) Congestion-condition, (2) Load-condition and (3) Unload-condition to assist state transitions. As stated in <ref> [LPPA97] </ref>, congestion can be detected by various factors, such as, packet loss rate exceeding a certain threshold, or percentage of video frames missing deadlines exceeding a threshold. <p> The system is presented in more details in an earlier paper <ref> [LPPA97] </ref>, which also addresses the retransmission-based error recovery schemes and the basic rate control. Currently, the major features of the hierarchical rate control protocols are implemented in the system. <p> LVMR has two novel features: 1) the use of retransmissions in 24 a layered environment and 2) the use of hierarchical control to manage the adding and dropping of video layers by receivers. Our previous work <ref> [LPPA97] </ref> has considered the first aspect while this paper focusses on the second. We describe the insight behind the mechanisms we propose for our protocol and then describe in some detail the operation of the basic protocol and some proposed extensions.

In RLM [MJV96], a fully distributed approach is advocated in which a receiver, by itself, makes decisions to add or drop an enhancement layer. This decision is enhanced by a "shared learning" process in which information from experiments conducted by other receivers is used to improve performance. <p> In LVMR, we take a hierarchical approach in the receivers' dynamic rate control schemes, so as to allow receivers to maintain minimal state information and decrease control traffic on the multicast session. It also provides more functionality compared to the simple receiver-driven schemes, as in RLM <ref> [MJV96] </ref>. In particular, it allows multiple experiments to be conducted simultaneously, and also helps drop the correct layer (s) during congestion in most cases, which are not possible in RLM because of its completely distributed approach. <p> However, if these decisions are made independent of the results of join/leave experiments done by others, the results can be disastrous. Thus it is fundamental for each receiver to know about the experiments and their results. This is called shared learning <ref> [MJV96] </ref>, because receivers share knowledge of what is going on in the network. The mechanism used in the RLM protocol [MJV96] to achieve this goal is multicasting the beginning of experiments and the results of experiments to every member of the group. <p> Thus it is fundamental for each receiver to know about the experiments and their results.

The mechanism used in the RLM protocol [MJV96] to achieve this goal is multicasting the beginning of experiments and the results of experiments to every member of the group. We believe this is neither scalable nor efficient, because of the following reasons: 1. Every receiver need not know about every experiment and/or its result.
