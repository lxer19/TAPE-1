It has most of the basics. I elaborate here only the representation of the power series. The gradient objects corresponding to f is the n-th derivative of f with respect to x divided by n factorial.

Reference-contexts: Changing case is beyond the scope of the C preprocessor but is possible in m4, hence the choice. Many sections of this document are written in the literate programming system noweb <ref> [2] </ref> based on Donald Knuth's original WEB. It is designed to blend the program code with an intelligible explanation of what occurs.
