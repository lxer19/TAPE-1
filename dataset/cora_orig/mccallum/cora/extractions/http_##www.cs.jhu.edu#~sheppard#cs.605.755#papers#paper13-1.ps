Abstract: We report on work done to develop a benchmark problem for genetic programming, both as a difficult problem to test GP abilities and as a platform for tuning GP parameters. This benchmark, the royal tree, is a function that accounts for tree shape as part of its evaluation function, thus it controls for a parameter not often found in the GP literature. It also is a progressive function, allowing the user to set the difficulty of the problem attempted. We not only describe the function, but also report on results of using island parallelism for solving GP problems. The results obtained are somewhat surprising, as it appears that a single large population outperforms a group of smaller populations under all the conditions tested. Given the multiplicity of GP programs that could produce the correct solution for a particular problem, it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of various architectural changes or parameter settings on the performance of a GP system. We encountered these problems directly in the design of our genetic programming tool lilgp. When lilgp was completed, we wanted to test how well it solved a set of standard GP problems. In fact, for a new GP system it is difficult to judge whether it is performing as intended or not, since the programs it generates are not necessarily identical to those generated by other GP systems. This raised two questions: what constitutes a "standard" problem in GP, and how do we rate the performance of a system on such a problem. One of the goals of this research was to create a benchmark problem to test how well a particular GP configuration would perform as compared to other configurations. Such benchmarks have existed for some time in the GA field, in particular the royal road problems of Holland [Jones 1994]. In creating the royal road, Holland addressed three issues. First, the royal road provides a proof-of-principle for the kind of difficult problems, exhibiting deception, that a genetic algorithm is capable of solving. Second, it serves as a benchmark of performance for tuning GA parameters. For example, at ICGA93, Holland claimed a specialized, properly tuned GA
