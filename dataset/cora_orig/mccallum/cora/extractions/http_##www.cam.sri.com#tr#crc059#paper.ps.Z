Abstract: The paper describes the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) system, a prototype automatic speech translator. SLT is currently capable of translating spoken English queries in the domain of air travel planning into either Swedish or French, using a vocabulary of about 1200 words. We present an overview of the system's architecture, concentrating on how rationally constructed balanced corpora are used to allow rapid development of high-quality limited-domain translation systems.

Reference-contexts: The problems involved here are mainly of two types: extension of the lexicon with suitable domain-specific entries, and training of the preference mechanisms that distinguish plausible from implausible grammatical analyses. These issues are discussed at length elsewhere (cf. in particular Chapters 5 and 7 of <ref> (Agnas et al., 1994) </ref>). In the present paper, we will assume that the work needed to achieve a high level of source-language coverage has already been carried out, and concentrate on the problems that arise in the translation step. <p> Firstly, source-language analysis can of course fail to produce a valid result. This is an important problem, but one which is outside the scope of the current paper: it is discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 7 of <ref> (Agnas et al., 1994) </ref>. For instance, sentence 11 in Table 1 is an error of this type: the root cause of the bad translation is that "Wednesday afternoon from Charlotte to Los Angeles" has incorrectly been parsed as a noun-phrase.

Reference-contexts: Table 3 show some sample lines from the English ATIS syntactic representative corpus. We are currently implementing tools to produce collocational representative corpora. The basic idea is simple: the items represented will be "semantic triples" <ref> (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) </ref> consisting of two head-words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs or determiners) together with a grammatical relation linking them.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes a project centered around one such advanced prototype, the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) system. SLT can translate spoken English utterances from the domain of air travel planning (ATIS; <ref> (Hemphill et al., 1990) </ref>) into spoken Swedish or French, using a vocabulary of about 1200 stem entries. Table 1 shows some examples of typical sentences from this domain, together with French translations produced by the system.

Reference-contexts: The SLT system consists of a set of individual processing modules, linked together in a pipelined fashion as shown in Figure 2. Speech enters the system at the top left of the diagram and is processed by the SRI DECIPHER (TM) recognizer <ref> (Murveit et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is a typical example of a simple collocational problem. Dividing translation problems into these three types is good from the point of view of modularity (the point is argued at much greater length in <ref> (Rayner and Bouillon, 1995) </ref>). When performing routine testing of the system, however, we run into an obvious problem: nearly every corpus sentence exhibits all three types of problem, so it is difficult to get quick feedback on what is going wrong when an error occurs. <p> Sentence 13 in Table 1 is an example of a collocational error; the implicit bare plural determiner of "meals" has been translated as "les" (the default), instead of "des", which is the correct choice in this context. We have made fair progress towards dealing with collocational problems <ref> (Rayner and Bouillon, 1995) </ref>, but still need to do more work.

Reference-contexts: When the "best" target-language QLF has been selected, unpacked, and subjected to the post-transfer operations, it is passed to a second copy of the CLE, loaded with a target-language grammar and lexicon; this generates a surface string using the Semantic Head-Driven algorithm <ref> (Shieber et al., 1990) </ref>. Finally, the target-language string is passed to a speech synthesizer and converted into output speech.
