Abstract: Reliability is a major concern in the design of large disk arrays. Hellerstein et al. pioneered the study of erasure-resilient codes that allow one to reconstruct the original data even in the presence of disk failures. In this paper, we take a set systems view of the problem of constructing erasure-resilient codes. This leads to interesting extremal problems in finite set theory. Solutions to some of these problems are characterized by well-known combinatorial designs. In other instances, combinatorial designs are shown to give asymptotically exact solutions to these problems. As a result, we improve, extend and generalize previous results of Hellerstein et al.

Reference-contexts: Earlier, Rabin [26] had investigated erasure-resilient codes for information dispersal, but his codes are not particularly suited for disk array applications. Very recently, Alon et al. <ref> [2] </ref> have also studied erasure-resilient codes to combat bursty losses in packet-switched networks. The parameters of interest there are also different from those for disk arrays. In this paper, we address the problem of designing erasure-resilient codes for large disk arrays along the theme of [17].

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon has transformed many computationally-bound applications to being I/O-bound. Indeed, Am-dahl <ref> [3] </ref> already predicted about three decades ago that unless accompanied by corresponding increases in secondary storage performance, big increases in microprocessor performance can only bring about marginal improvements in overall system performance. This disparity has led to the consideration of parallelism as a means to speed up secondary storage systems. <p> The only 3-uniform configurations (Y; B), 2 jBj 4, for which j B2B Bj 4 t, are those shown in Figure 2. By Lemma 4.2, these configurations must be avoided by the set system of any (3; 4)-ERC. Forbidding P 1 from the set system (X; A) of an <ref> [n; c; 3; 4] </ref>-ERC is equivalent to saying that (X; A) is a 2-(c; 3; 1) packing. The configuration P 2 is known in the design theory literature under various names: quadrilateral, Pasch configuration, fragment, or arrow (see [10]). <p> Theorem 6.6 (Brouwer [5]) There exists an anti-Pasch STS (v) for all v 3 (mod 6). The results for anti-Pasch STS (v), v 1 (mod 6) are more fragmented; see [10] for a survey, and [8] for recent results. So by observing the equivalence between <ref> [n; c; 3; 4] </ref>-ERC with optimal check disk overhead and optimal anti-Pasch 2-(c; 3; 1) packings, we can improve Lemma 6.2 as follows. <p> It follows that every point must appear in 28 precisely ff blocks of A i . Consequently, A i is an ff-resolution class. The sup-ports of the remaining columns of C constitute a partial ff-resolution class. fl Hellerstein et al. [17] construct <ref> [3 m (3 m 1)=6; 3 m ; 3; 4] </ref>-ERCs with a 1-balanced ordering. In fact, the set system of their (3; 4)-ERC is the affine geometry AG 1 (m; 3) (see, for example, [4]), whose 1-resolvability is a classical result in design theory. <p> An STS (v) that is 1-resolvable is known as a Kirkman triple system of order v, or KTS (v). Our discussion shows that the problem of constructing <ref> [n; c; 3; 4] </ref>-ERC, c 3 (mod 6), with optimal check disk overhead, having a 1-balanced ordering is equivalent to the following problem. Problem 8.7 Determine those v for which there exists an anti-Pasch KTS (v).

[17] posed the open problem of determining F (c; 4). 7.1 Finite Field Construction for l 2 f4; 5g Lemma 4.2 implies that for (X; A) to be the set system of an <ref> [n; c; 4] </ref>-ERC, it is necessary and sufficient to avoid the five configurations in Figure 3. Avoiding Q 1 means that (X; A) is a 3-(c; 4; 1) packing. Therefore, F (c; 4) D (c; 4; 3). <p> Here, we address the more difficult problem of constructing (4; 5)-ERC, and in the process, obtain asymptotically exact bounds on both F (c; 4) and F (c; 4; 5).

Theorem 7.7 Let q be an odd prime power, and let be an integer such that 1 (q 1)=2. Then there exists an <ref> [n; c; 4; 5] </ref>-ERC, where c = 3q 1 + and n = q (q 1). Proof. <p> Corollary 7.8 F (c; 4) = fi (c 3 ) and F (c; 4; 5) = fi (c 3 ). Proof. Let q be the largest odd prime power at most (2c + 3)=7. Taking = (q 1)=2 in Theorem 7.7 gives a <ref> [q (q 1) 2 =2; (7q 3)=2; 4; 5] </ref>-ERC. Hence, F (c; 4; 5) F ((7q 3)=2; 4; 5) q (q 1) 2 (1 o (1)) 343 The last inequality follows from bounds on the gap between consecutive primes (see, for example, [23]). <p> By Lemma 7.10, this is the set system of a (4; 5)-ERC: Lemma 7.11 Let q be an odd prime power. Then there exists a <ref> [q (q 1) 2 =2; 4q 2; 4; 5] </ref>-ERC, where the group sizes are q 2 =2 and q (q 1)=2. 7.2 Transversal Design Construction for l 2 f6; 7g Let (X; A) be the set system of a (4; 6)-ERC. <p> Removing a group in a TD (k; n) gives a TD (k 1; n). Consider the standard construction of a transversal design TD (4; q), where q is a prime power (see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>).

The result is an STS (2vn + 1) <ref> [4] </ref>, which we prove is anti-Pasch. Suppose to the contrary that a Pasch configuration is present. If it contains 1, it contains two horizontal and two vertical triples, since the STS (2n + 1) used is anti-Pasch. <p> To see that the TD (3; h) induced by any three groups is anti-Pasch, the presence of a Pasch configuration implies that the desarguesian projective plane of order p contains a projective subplane of order two, which it does not when p is odd <ref> [4] </ref>. fl In order to apply Rees's technique, we begin with an anti-Pasch GDD which admits a certain resolution.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Schonheim [32] has shown that for v 1, 3, or 5 (mod 6), every 2 (v; 3; 1) packing with D (v; 3; 2) blocks contains a 2-(v 1; 3; 1) packing with D (v 1; 3; 2) blocks. fl Already twenty years ago, Erdos <ref> [11] </ref> made the conjecture that there exists an anti-Pasch STS (v) for all v 1 or 3 (mod 6) whenever v is sufficiently large. The unique STS (7) and the two nonisomorphic STS (13) contain Pasch configurations. Brouwer [5] refined Erdos' conjecture as follows.

Then there exists an anti-Pasch KTS (3v). 31 Proof: This construction is a simple modification of one in <ref> [13] </ref>. Let V 0 = V fi f0; 1; 2g. <p> We construct the following set of blocks.

Reference-contexts: Failures in disk arrays are often assumed to satisfy the memoryless property, that is, the life expectancy of a disk is dependent only upon the condition that the disk is working now. Under this assumption, the reliability of a disk array is modeled by the exponential distribution <ref> [14] </ref>. As a consequence, for low disk failure rates, the failure rate of a disk array is directly proportional to the number of disks it contains. Many applications, notably database and transaction processing systems, require both high throughput and high data availability of their storage systems.

Reference-contexts: Error-correcting codes can be used to tolerate erasures. However, components in disk arrays allow us to determine exactly where erasures have occurred. It is possible to take advantage of this additional information to derive codes that are better than those based on error-correcting codes. 3 Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref> pioneered the study of erasure-resilient codes for large disk arrays. Earlier, Rabin [26] had investigated erasure-resilient codes for information dispersal, but his codes are not particularly suited for disk array applications. Very recently, Alon et al. [2] have also studied erasure-resilient codes to combat bursty losses in packet-switched networks. <p> The parameters of interest there are also different from those for disk arrays. In this paper, we address the problem of designing erasure-resilient codes for large disk arrays along the theme of <ref> [17] </ref>. By interpreting the coding problem in the context of extremal set theory, we obtain new classes of optimal and asymptotically optimal erasure-resilient codes. These codes improve and extend previous results in the literature. <p> The definition of an [n; c; k]-ERC ensures that we can reconstruct the original data in the presence of up to k erasures. 4 For performance reasons, the erasure-resilient codes we study throughout this paper are assumed to satisfy the following two conditions, as in <ref> [17] </ref>. (i) We restrict ourselves to systematic codes. An [n; c; k]-ERC is systematic if E i (S) = S i , for 1 i n, where S = (S 1 ; : : : ; S n ). <p> The failure of the corresponding disks makes reconstruction of data impossible. In fact, this is the only situation in which disk failures are irrecoverable. Lemma 3.1 (Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref>) A set of disk failures is recoverable if and only if the corresponding set of columns in its parity-check matrix is linearly independent. <p> This equivalence between k-ERC and k-error-detecting codes means that results on error-detecting codes can be brought to bear. However, the study of codes for error detection has not focused on the metrics discussed in the previous section. Indeed, as observed in <ref> [17] </ref>, many of these codes are not suitable for disk array applications because they have large update penalties. 6 Corollary 3.3 H = [C j I] is the parity-check matrix of a k-ERC if and only if for every t k columns, c 1 ; : : : ; c t <p> A (k + 1)-erasure is irrecoverable if it corresponds to the failure of an information disk and its k associated check disks. We call such (k + 1)- erasures bad. With update penalty k, one can nonetheless hope to tolerate all (k + 1)-erasures, except for bad ones <ref> [17] </ref>. In fact, it can happen that all t-erasures for some t &gt; k are recoverable except for those that contain bad (k + 1)-erasures. <p> For general k, the only previously known lower bound on F (c; k; l) is due to Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref> and applies when l = k.

For k l 2k 8 (hence k 8), the (k; l)-ERC we built from expanders are at least as reliable and have asymptotically better check disk overheads than those provided by Theorem 5.7. <p> In Sections 6 and 7, we give exact and asymptotically exact bounds for several cases when k is small. 13 (a) P 1 (b) P 2 6 Optimal (3; l)-ERC and Anti-Pasch Steiner Triple Systems An extensive treatment of (3; l)-ERC was given by Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref> for l = 3 and 4.

It is an order of magnitude better than the bound on F (c; 4) obtained in [17]. One drawback of the (4; 5)-ERC constructed in Theorem 7.7 is that the group sizes are large and nonuniform. <p> 4; 5) F (c; 4) D (c; 4; 3) 24 gives the required result. fl The bound on F (c; 4; 5) in Corollary 7.8 improves upon the results of Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref>. It is an order of magnitude better than the bound on F (c; 4) obtained in [17]. One drawback of the (4; 5)-ERC constructed in Theorem 7.7 is that the group sizes are large and nonuniform. Among the 3q 1 + points, 2q have replication number (q 1), q 1 have replication number q, and 21 the remaining have replication number q (q 1). <p> We now discuss this problem more formally. The terminology we use here generalizes that in <ref> [17] </ref>. Definition 8.1 Let ff be a positive integer. <p> Another use of balanced orderings observed by Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref> is in the design of extendible disk array systems. If we have chosen a code whose parity-check matrix have more columns than we need, then as more disks are added to the system, the extra columns are put to use. <p> The existence of an ff-balanced ordering for the original parity-check matrix ensures that we have ff-balanced group size at all times if disks are associated with columns according to this ordering. The case ff = 1 was considered in <ref> [17] </ref>. 27 Definition 8.3 Let ff be a positive integer and (X; A) a set system. Let B A. <p> It follows that every point must appear in 28 precisely ff blocks of A i . Consequently, A i is an ff-resolution class. The sup-ports of the remaining columns of C constitute a partial ff-resolution class. fl Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref> construct [3 m (3 m 1)=6; 3 m ; 3; 4]-ERCs with a 1-balanced ordering. In fact, the set system of their (3; 4)-ERC is the affine geometry AG 1 (m; 3) (see, for example, [4]), whose 1-resolvability is a classical result in design theory. <p> One of the major problems faced by critical applications is the reliability of disk arrays. In this paper, we have provided constructions for erasure-resilient codes that can tolerate failures in disk arrays. Our results improve, extend, and generalize previous results of Hellerstein et al. <ref> [17] </ref>. One surprise in this work is the role of combinatorial designs. For example, it is shown that (3; 4)-ERC are equivalent to anti-Pasch Steiner triple systems, which have been studied actively for the past decade by mathematicians without having any particular applications in mind.

Reference-contexts: This is a well-known result in the theory of error-correcting codes <ref> [18] </ref>. The matrix H is called the parity-check matrix of the code. <p> It follows that H is the parity-check matrix of a k-ERC if and only if every set of k columns of H contains no nonempty set of linearly dependent columns. Precisely the same condition determines when H is the parity-check matrix of a k-error-detecting code <ref> [18] </ref>. Corollary 3.2 A k-ERC is equivalent to a k-error-detecting code. This equivalence between k-ERC and k-error-detecting codes means that results on error-detecting codes can be brought to bear. However, the study of codes for error detection has not focused on the metrics discussed in the previous section.

The proof of this theorem is lengthy and similar to the proof in <ref> [28] </ref>, so we do not include it here. Briefly, we inflate the GDD so that for every block of size k, we put the TD (k; h) that corresponds to the groups of the k points.

Reference-contexts: The disk array architecture organizes many independent small disks into one large logical disk, as illustrated in Figure 1. Small disks are preferable to large ones because they have a lower cost and consume less power. For 2 improved performance, disk arrays employ the concept of data striping <ref> [31] </ref>, which spreads data to multiple disks. This allows both single and multiple I/O requests to be processed in parallel by separate disks, thus improving effective transfer rates. A further advantage of disk striping is uniform load balance.

Lemma 8.8 There exists an anti-Pasch KTS (33). Proof: Consider the following KTS (33) from <ref> [33] </ref>. Let V = Z 33 . f1; 3; 6g, f17; 19; 32g, f9; 11; 24g, f22; 25; 13g, f5; 8; 29g, f27; 30; 18g, 30 f3; 10; 20g, f1; 2; 6g, f2; 3; 7g, f3; 4; 8g, f1; 12; 23g. Let (x) = x + 3.

Reference-contexts: This gives a 3-resolvable QFGDD of type 9 n . Fill in the holes with anti-Pasch KTS (9)s. fl 8.3 Zhu, Du and Zhang's Construction We use a technique introduced by Zhu, Du and Zhang <ref> [34] </ref> and later extended by Rees and Stinson [29]. A design D is s-block-colorable if its blocks can be colored with s colors in such a way that any two blocks of the same color do not intersect. Such an assignment of s colors is said to be an s-coloring. <p> Such an assignment of s colors is said to be an s-coloring. If D is s-block-colorable but not (s 1)-block-colorable, we say that the chromatic index of D is s. Theorem 8.23 <ref> [34] </ref> Suppose there exists an resolvable BIBD (u; k; 1), a BIBD (v; k; 1) which is s-block-colorable, and a resolvable TD (k; v). If s r u + r v where r x = x1 k1 , then there exists an resolvable BIBD (uv; k; 1).
