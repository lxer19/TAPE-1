Title: OVERVIEW OF THE EXPRESS-X LANGUAGE

Abstract: The requirement for a formal EXPRESS mapping language in STEP has long been recognized. A number of mapping languages have been developed which allow users to specify how EXPRESS defined data will be transferred between one application and another. This paper presents an overview of one of these languages, named EXPRESS-X. EXPRESS-X is expected to evolve into an official EXPRESS mapping language, and an SC4 stage 0 project has begun to develop a first draft language reference manual for it. This paper provides a broad overview of EXPRESS-X, covering its features and its use of conformance classes to specialize the language for certain mapping tasks. The paper also discusses the requirements for EXPRESS mapping languages.

Reference-contexts: In order for there to be a mapping, these systems must contain semantically similar data, but that data may be defined differently. The following requirements are those highlighted by EXPRESS Users from an informal survey done by the authors, and those already established by previous mapping projects <ref> [Bai96] </ref>. General Requirements Human and Computer Interpretable The language should be understandable to humans (who will have to write and debug code). It should also be a formal computer language which can be used by compilers / interpreters to produce software interfaces.

Reference-contexts: Each International Standard in the ISO 10303 series is published as a separate Part. Parts are grouped into one of the following classes: description methods, integrated resources, application protocols, implementation forms, and conformance testing. The classes are described in ISO 10303-Part 1. This paper describes the EXPRESS-X language <ref> [EXPX96] </ref>, an evolving language that can be used to define mappings between entities from one EXPRESS schema to entities in another schema that represents an abstract view of the first.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION ISO 10303 (STEP) is a series of International Standards for the computersensible representation and exchange of product data <ref> [ISO94a] </ref>. The objective is to provide a mechanism capable of describing product data throughout the life cycle of a product, independent from any particular system.

Reference-contexts: As a result, there is a need to be able to easily create views of product models that are tailored to individual application systems. This will in general improve the usability of the STEP standards in many situations. In STEP, a product model is defined using EXPRESS <ref> [ISO94b, Sch94] </ref>. This means that a view of a product model must be based on the EXPRESS definition of that product model. Thus, for STEP, a language is needed that facilitates definitions of views of EXPRESS information models. This is the purpose of EXPRESS-X.
