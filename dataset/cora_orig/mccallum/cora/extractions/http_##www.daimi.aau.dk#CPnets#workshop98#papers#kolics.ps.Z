Abstract: A request-level timed stochastic CPN model of a leaf Internet object cache is proposed in this paper. The leaf cache is modelled as a discrete time discrete event dynamic system together with its adjustable input-, measurable output, disturbance and state variables. The CPN model has been verified and validated against real measured data. The developed model will be used form model-based optimal selection of the most influental tuning parameters modelled as input variables on the performance of the cache.

Reference-contexts: It must be stressed that these measured data contain per request based measurements since the profiling data are measured by the caching software for every request. Details on the measurements and measured data have been reported elsewhere <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The effect of the hierarchy related tuning parameters is not investigated therefore random variables are used to describe the average behaviour of the hierarchy towards the cache. With the assumptions above a hierarchical stochastic timed CPN model <ref> [6] </ref> is developed which is described in a top-down manner. The model has been implemented and tested using the Design/CPN package [7] containing a CPN editor, a macro-language for declarations and procedures and a CPN simulator. The model is described using the syntax of the Design/CPN package.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the model parameters above have also been determined from measurements either directly or in an indirect way. 5.1 Measurements The caching software used at the modelled cache was Squid-1.1.17. <ref> [8] </ref> This software generates two log files which are useful for analysing the cache activity. We applied a patch made available by Alex Rousskov [9] which enhances the log file records by some time profiling data.
