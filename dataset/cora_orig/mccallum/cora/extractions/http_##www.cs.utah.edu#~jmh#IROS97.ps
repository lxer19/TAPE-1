Abstract: Applying positive joint torque feedback in direct drive motor systems reduces the effect of external load torques. This is most beneficial when accurate position tracking is required in the presence of large disturbances or for complex loads as found in robotic manipulators. We formulate the problem of torque feedback in the presence of actuator dynamics. The problem of finding the optimal torque feedback which minimizes the maximum disturbance sensitivity is equivalent to the model-matching problem. The effect of the load on the rotor dynamics appears as a perturbation minimized by the proposed torque feedback. To synthesize the torque filter, only the actuator dynamics and a very rough knowledge about the mechanical load is required.

Reference-contexts: The mechanical rotor dynamics is fairly simple and can be determined accurately [2]. In addition, in previous work we showed that we can compensate the nonlinearities of the motor using optimal commutation [3] based on online identification <ref> [1] </ref> of the motor parameters without any knowledge of the mechanical load. However, the problem which stands in the way of compensating the load torques exactly is the actuator dynamics which has a finite bandwidth and may not respond fast enough to the load torque.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are using this measure to design a robot controller. Robot manipulators can have very complicated dynamics since they are multibody systems driven by actuator-transmission systems which are difficult to model as well. This complexity makes it hard to implement model-based control <ref> [4] </ref>. Direct drive actuation eliminates the transmissions and permits more accurate dynamic models for control provided all the model parameters can be identified or are known [4, 5]. <p> This complexity makes it hard to implement model-based control [4].

Reference-contexts: Now the problem is to find a stable and realizable filter Q (s) 2 RH 1 such that the maximum weighted sensitivity of the system kW (s)X (s)k is minimized, inf This is a model-matching problem, and algorithms to compute the optimal Q (s) are available <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. It should be noted that the maximum gain of W (s) plays no role in finding the optimal Q because it can be always factorized in (2). Hence for convenience we normalize W (s) such that kW (s)k 1 = 1. <p> For a minimum phase system the solution is trivial and the disturbances can be attenuated at will. But when H (s) has a single zero in the right half-plane s 0 , Re s 0 &gt; 0, according to the maximum modulus theorem <ref> [6] </ref> we can say fl opt jW (s 0 )j and Q (s) has a unique solution (j j indicates the magnitude of a complex variable).

Reference-contexts: The non-parametric modeling of the system was performed by spectral analysis. Then, several parametric models were examined, and it turned out that a fourth order system can match the behavior of the system adequately <ref> [10] </ref>. Fig. 4 demonstrates graphically the validation of the parametric system model. The loci of the poles and parametric and parametric models, respectively. zeros of the system are plotted in Fig. 5 which clearly indicates that the system is non-minimum phase.
