Abstract: Terry Winograd, famous for his contributions to, and later rejection of, traditional approaches to Artificial Intelligence, maintains many philosophical views that have not yet been widely accepted in what Winograd would call the `rationalistic' community. One of the most controversial of these is his Heideggerian rejection of `realism', the ontological doctrine that objects of perception and cognition exist objectively outside the mind. In the ongoing debate on this issue among the Symbolic Systems faculty at Stanford, there has been much opposition to Winograd, partly resulting from some basic misunderstandings about the exact nature of his rejection of realism, including its motivations and implications. In this paper, I will carefully explain

Reference-contexts: Brooks argues that "the symbol system hypothesis upon which classical AI is based is fundamentally flawed," (emphasis in original) and proposes "an alternative view... based on the physical grounding hypothesis." <ref> [1] </ref> The traditional "symbol system hypothesis" says cognition can be defined in terms of the processing of symbols, with traditional realist meanings and referents in the world. The "physical grounding hypothesis" bases cognition on interaction with the physical world.

Reference-contexts: I find it very interesting that Fred Dretske, die-hard realist, finds that traditional theories of meaning have difficulty making the objective facticity of a meaning in the world play a causal role in explaining behavior (discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>), and that his solution to this is to say that where the facticity, the world, plays a causal role in the efficacy of meanings, is exactly just in the learning, the evolution, which gives the meaning a correspondence with the thing in the world it represents. <p> An interesting experiment might be to try to translate the picture of the role of learning presented in <ref> [2] </ref> into a form whose only difference from the original is that it does not presume the objective existence of some "facts" in the world corresponding to meanings. 8 5 Non-Realism and AI Most researchers in AI are still pursuing a very traditional approach that takes some formalized domain as the

Reference-contexts: Fred Dretske, for instance, says that Winograd is "just doing epistemology," <ref> [3] </ref> i.e., just considering what we can know, and not what's really out there. <p> So to the extent that he says I'm therefore giving up doing ontology, I'm giving up a certain sense of what it would be to do ontology. [4] However, Dretske also suggests that Winograd is "confusing epistemology with ontology," <ref> [3] </ref> but that I think is inaccurate. <p> I may not have any way of telling what's in distant stars in outer space, I wouldn't conclude from that that there are no distant stars, or that they're hollow." <ref> [3] </ref> However, that's not what Winograd is saying at all. The world is real; he simply questions the ability of our logical notions of discrete "things" to capture the true nature of that reality. <p> Dretske: "If you take people away it [the world] doesn't become a kind of homogeneous bowl of jelly with no carving, no joints, as it were, 3 what it is out there is it has exactly the joints we, given our conceptual scheme, take it to have." <ref> [3] </ref> To these people, if you claim the world has no objective boundary lines, then you seem to be claiming that the world is smooth, homogeneous, structureless. But that does not necessarily follow, and Winograd does not believe it.

This has been a point of confusion for many people upon first hearing Winograd's views, including myself. <p> Although Winograd does not believe that philosophers' complex ontologies reflect objective truths, he does not discard them as useless for all purposes. Winograd says that "ontology as an enterprise is very useful." <ref> [4] </ref> It's something that philosophers and scientists in our culture do that helps us organize and understand the world. Even everyday people do a loose form of ontology, wondering about the existence of God, or whether life is all a dream. <p> They certainly exist in the discourse by which we understand our world, no question about that; and to say, well, they don't exist, but photons do, is making this assumption that there's this sort of external notion of existence which is separate from that, which is not ultimately doable. <ref> [4] </ref> So for Winograd, even if the world were to have a formalizable structure, we could never approach that structure, either as the cognitive beings that are being studied or as the philosophers who are doing the studying.

Reference-contexts: As an interesting illustration of this, we usually think 5 of physics as having determined the objective truth of the reality of, say, subatomic particles. But Stephen Hawking, in <ref> [5] </ref>, suggests an interesting alternative ontology, a re-articulation: We now know that Laplace's hopes of determinism cannot be realized, at least in the terms he had in mind.

Reference-contexts: any such explanation will be based on a provisional ontology, suitable for the scientific discourse at hand, but will never be an "objectively correct" breakdown of the interaction between mind and world.) Winograd's answer draws upon the writings of the biologist Maturana, and is discussed extensively in chapter 4 of <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> I think Winograd may be right when he claims in <ref> [7] </ref> that Heideggerian philosophy seems to tap into deeper intuitions, in its basis in everyday experience, than the abstract, removed philosophies of the "rationalistic tradition." Of course, this is just my personal impression.
