Abstract: A major issue in case-basedsystems is retrieving the appropriate cases from memory to solve a given problem. This implies that a case should be indexed appropriately when stored in memory. A case-based system, being dynamic in that it stores cases for reuse, needs to learn indices for the new knowledge as the system designers cannot envision that knowledge. Irrespective of the type of indexing (structural or functional), a hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models help in learning structural indices to design cases in the domain of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design provides both the vocabulary for structural indexing of design cases and the inductive biases for index generalization. We further discuss how model-based learning can be integrated with similarity-based learning (that uses prior design cases) for learning the level of index generalization.

Reference-contexts: The model-based approach to index learning is also related to explanation-based approaches such as explanation-based generalization (EBG) (Mitchell, Keller & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986), explanation-based learning (EBL) (DeJong & Mooney, 1986), and explanation-based indexing (EBI) <ref> (Barletta & Mark, 1988) </ref>. Since the SBF models provide an explanation of the functioning of a device, like EBG, EBL and EBI, our approach also uses explanations for learning.

Reference-contexts: Other types of indices to design cases of physical devices can be functions of the devices and causal principles in the domain. In our previous work, we have shown how functional indices can be automatically learned using models <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1992) </ref>. But in this paper, we focus on the task of learning structural indices and analyze the task in the context of case-based design of physical devices. 1.1 Issues in Index Learning Generalization-Specialization hierarchies provide a very general model for organizing the case memory (Kolodner, 1980). <p> In other experiments, we have shown how SBF models constrain learning of functional indices <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1992) </ref>. That the same models can be used to learn both structural and functional indices shows that the representations and the model-based method may be general enough to learn multiple types of indices.

Reference-contexts: Here we describe the content and representation of SBF models. IDEAL's models of specific devices are represented in the form of SBF models. These models are based on a component-substance ontology <ref> (Bylander & Chandrasekaran, 1985) </ref>. In this ontology, the structure of a device is viewed as constituted of components and substances. Components form the structural topology of the device. Substances are what flow between components with a corresponding rate. Substances have locations in reference to the components in the device.

Reference-contexts: In our previous work we showed how device models can help answer many of the issues that arise in case-based design. For example, <ref> (Goel, 1991a, 1991b) </ref> showed how model-based reasoning can be used for adapting past designs. Another major issue in case-based reasoning is retrieving the appropriate cases from memory to solve a given problem. This problem involves issues such as indexing, indexing vocabulary, and index learning. <p> Finally, we evaluated the learned indices by using IDEAL's retrieval as a performance task. 2 Case-Based Design IDEAL is an autonomous design system that evolved from an earlier system called KRITIK that integrates case-based reasoning and model-based reasoning <ref> (Goel, 1991a, 1991b) </ref>. <p> This ontology thus gives rise to a behavioral representation language (BRL) <ref> (Goel, 1991a) </ref> for describing the SBF model of a design that is a generalization on functional representation scheme (Sembugamoorthy & Chandrasekaran, 1986; Chandrasekaran, Goel & Iwasaki, 1993). The constituents of the SBF model are described below with an example. <p> In the absence of the SBF model of the design case however, IDEAL uses all the structural features specified as indices to the case and generalizes along them using similarity-based learning. 6 Related Research Our work on IDEAL evolves from earlier work on KRITIK such as <ref> (Goel, 1991a, 1991b) </ref>. IDEAL's component-substance ontology, structure-behavior-function models, and behavioral representation language all are borrowed from KRITIK. The problem-solving component of IDEAL currently evolves from KRITIK2 (Stroulia et al., 1992; Stroulia & Goel, 1992a).

Reference-contexts: The SBF model of a new design is generated by revising the model of the retrieved design during problem solving <ref> (Goel, 1991b) </ref>. Thus it depends on the problem-solving component to generate the model.

Reference-contexts: It used primarily the discriminability and the previous predictive power of features to select a subset of features as indices. However, it could only A-9 choose indices from the predetermined context-dependent feature lists and could not learn the indexing vocabulary itself. CHEF <ref> (Hammond, 1989) </ref> uses explanation-based techniques to learn indices to plans from planning failures; in particular, it learns features in the domain that are predictive of negative interactions between plan steps. By learning predictive features, it can select plans that avoid problems.

Reference-contexts: Other studies indicate that under different conditions remindings can occur based on only surface similarity or only deep similarity, or both <ref> (Holyoak & Koh, 1987) </ref>. From the computational perspective, the retrieval and indexing are especially hard in supporting real-world tasks such as designing physical devices because they generally require a large memory.

Reference-contexts: But in this paper, we focus on the task of learning structural indices and analyze the task in the context of case-based design of physical devices. 1.1 Issues in Index Learning Generalization-Specialization hierarchies provide a very general model for organizing the case memory <ref> (Kolodner, 1980) </ref>. Since cases can be discriminated along multiple dimensions, the case memory in general may contain multiple generalization-specialization hierarchies. <p> Although the issue of indexing has been for long central to AI theories that emphasize the role of memory in reasoning (e.g., Kolodner, 1980; Lebowitz, 1980; Schank, 1982), there are relatively very few models that address the issue of automatic acquisition of indices to learned pieces of knowledge. CYRUS <ref> (Kolodner, 1980) </ref> was one of the earliest systems that addressed the selection of indices to a new episode. It used primarily the discriminability and the previous predictive power of features to select a subset of features as indices.

Reference-contexts: By learning predictive features, it can select plans that avoid problems. It also indexes plans by the goals that the plans satisfy. AQUA <ref> (Ram, 1989, 1993) </ref> uses a content-based approach to index learning and uses explanation-based methods within this approach. AQUA learns particular kinds of knowledge that make good indices to explanatory cases by selecting the indices from the predetermined classes of stereotypical concept descriptions that constitute good indices in its domain.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, IDEAL learns multiple types of indices. Winston's (1980) work addressed the task of learning causal principles from experience. Dietterich's (1992) work focuses on learning specialized models from general domain models. The task in ASIS <ref> (Roverso, Edwards & Sleeman, 1992) </ref> is learning of abstract models from experiences. The learning strategy and the knowledge used in model-based learning are different from that in explanation-based approaches in several ways. <p> Specifically, it uses the model-based approach to learn the indexing features, and SBL to generalize over the learned features. IDEAL's models are case-specific models, very similar to the explanations (i.e., causal structure in experiences) used by Winston (1980). In contrast, Dietterich's (1992) models are case-independent. ASIS's <ref> (Roverso, Edwards & Sleeman, 1992) </ref> models are structural models and they are different from functional and causal models of devices.

Reference-contexts: ASIS's (Roverso, Edwards & Sleeman, 1992) models are structural models and they are different from functional and causal models of devices. In an associated project called Autognostic we are also exploring how SBF-like models of reasoning tasks help in reorganizing a reasoner's world model <ref> (Stroulia & Goel, 1992b) </ref>. 7 Conclusions Our experiments with the use of models similar to Winston's (1980) explanations for index learning lead us to three main conclusions: First, in an integrated system like IDEAL, there is close interaction between problem solving, comprehension, memory, and learning, and each of them imposes constraints
