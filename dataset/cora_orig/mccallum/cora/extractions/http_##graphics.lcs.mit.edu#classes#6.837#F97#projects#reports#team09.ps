Title: FREEDOM FROM DAMNATION Massive Gothic Effect Team  
Author: Angela Ge Ray Louie Richard Perng Dave Shue 
Abstract: Our project is to weave a story that manifests the tastefully horrific effect of the "gothic" theme. Mood is the fabric of the gothic genre. The ambience arises from the interweaving of various cinematic and graphical yarns will. Camera angles, camera pans and camera motion set the stage for fear and suspense. Lighting effects: dark shadows, pervasive fog, and flickering torch light, take viewer deep into the heart of the dark realm. Modelling realism in both look and behavior anchor the scene in believability. Background music and sounds complete the tapestry, bringing raw fear and intensity to the moment. By taking these threads and intertwining them within a storyline, we hope to create a tightly woven, rich gothic animation.
