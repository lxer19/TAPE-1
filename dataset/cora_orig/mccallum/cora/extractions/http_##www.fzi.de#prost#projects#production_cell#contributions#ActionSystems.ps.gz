Reference-contexts: The toy model and the simulator were developed at Forschungszentrum Informatik in Karlsruhe, and these have served as source for several formal specification case studies. A description of the model and a collection of earlier specifications of the production cell are given in <ref> [1] </ref>. We added one feature to the original task description, namely a robot called Frank that introduces blanks in the system at the feedbelt. This was seen as a way of starting off the system, and it should not be too inconsistent with the original plant either. <p> This kind of relations is described with RelyOn and Guarantee schemas. Originally the Z specification of the Robot Press subsystem of a production cell was developed for the case when 2 blanks were processed simultaneously, as pointed out in Task Description <ref> [1] </ref>. Then the authors realised that with such a specification they practically exclude the possibility of processing one blank. Moreover system's start and stop cases were not considered. Therefore several SkipPositions schemas for the Robot were created.

Reference-contexts: It should also be possible to simply replace the crane with some other "blank-removing" device at the end of the deposit belt in order to meet the demands of a non-circular production cell. The specification language Z <ref> [2] </ref> is used as a basis, and the specified operations are collected as guarded actions in different action systems [3]. By using the action system notation we introduce possibility of parallel execution. <p> ! State := State 0 :Op 1 [] ::: [] (pre Op N ) ! State := State 0 :Op N od where X := X 0 : &lt; predicate &gt; is nondeterministic assignment and pre Op i is the precondition of opera tion schema Op i as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. To model the production cell operation using the action systems describing separate units we employ a parallel composition operation presented in [3], which is defined as follows.

Reference-contexts: The specification language Z [2] is used as a basis, and the specified operations are collected as guarded actions in different action systems <ref> [3] </ref>. By using the action system notation we introduce possibility of parallel execution. This specification was done as a project work in a course in system specification held by Michael Butler and Kaisa Sere at the department of computer science at the Abo Akademi university. <p> The notion of an action system was introduced by Back and Kurki-Suonio. For a detailed description of an action system approach we refer to <ref> [3] </ref>. Action systems can be used to model parallel and reactive systems. Essentially an action system is a block, with some local variables and with a single iteration that can be executed in a parallel fashion. <p> To model the production cell operation using the action systems describing separate units we employ a parallel composition operation presented in <ref> [3] </ref>, which is defined as follows.
