Reference-contexts: By generating these views in real-time, it is possible to conduct a "virtual flyby" of the planetary surface where scientists can interactively examine false color terrains from a variety of positions and orientations, supporting rapid exploration of large data sets. A parallel ray-identification algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> distributes terrain data among processing nodes, decomposing via the natural data parallelism, and exploiting positional derivatives to vary rendering resolution. Together these techniques achieve several frames per second on gigabyte data sets, approaching the ten frames per second needed for real-time animation.
