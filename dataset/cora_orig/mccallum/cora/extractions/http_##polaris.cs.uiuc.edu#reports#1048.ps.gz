Title: BEWARE OF UNPERTURBED MODIFIED INCOMPLETE FACTORIZATIONS  
Author: VICTOR EIJKHOUT 
Abstract: A short note describes the possible dangers of combining (unperturbed) modified incomplete factorizations with certain ordering strategies of the matrix. Sufficient conditions are given for orderings that lead to zero or vanishing pivots, and numerical tests are given illustrating the latter phenomemon. In that case introducing perturbations of O(h 2 ) seems to alleviate the problem.

Whether this theoretical device is necessary in practice is not entirely clear, see <ref> [6] </ref> and [18]. The theory for perturbed modified factorizations usually incorporates some further conditions on the matrix ([18]) or its graph ([7]) to ensure the order reduction. In the part of this paper that is concerned with the existence of unperturbed modified factorizations such conditions need not be satisfied.

Zero pivots also surface in practical circumstances, for instance in the recent article of Duff and Meurant <ref> [13] </ref>, where divergent methods resulted from using a modified factorization in combination with ordering strategies for increased parallelism. In this article I will show that there exist classes of ordering strategies for which pivots are obtained that are either zero, or tend to zero as the mesh is refined. <p> It may be advantageous to reorder the matrix to increase the parallelism of the factorization, because this is in most cases the bottleneck of the iterative method. A number of ordering strategies were tested numerically by Duff and Meurant <ref> [13] </ref>, and a partial analysis of their tests can be found (for the case of unmodified factorizations) in [11] and [15]. However, certain ordering strategies may be dangerous in combination with modified incomplete factorizations. I will give two examples of this, as a preliminary to the general analysis. <p> A similar ordering for four processors (see figure 3, this corresponds to the `vdv1' and `vdv2' orderings in <ref> [13] </ref>) does not display the stated behaviour of the pivots, nor is this behaviour observed for an ordering with a vertical separator line instead of a diagonal one. <p> This finishes the proof of the lemma. Using this lemma one can predict that zero pivots will for instance occur in nodes 87 and 94 in the minimum degree ordering of figure 2.5 in <ref> [13] </ref>. The influence range of these nodes includes no boundary nodes, so any node in it has zero rowsum. Zero pivots could have been avoided here by the introduction of small perturbations, as follows from the above lemma, or any of the existence criteria mentioned in the introduction.

There it was recommended that quantities to be moved to the diagonal be multiplied by a factor ff, with a suggested value of ff = :95. One should note that even though perturbations are of order h 2 , the resulting change in the limit pivot is O (h).
