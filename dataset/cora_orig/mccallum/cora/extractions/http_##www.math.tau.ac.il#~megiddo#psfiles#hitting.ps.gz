Title: APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR HITTING OBJECTS WITH STRAIGHT LINES  
Author: Refael Hassin and Nimrod Megiddo 
Date: Revised June 1989  
Abstract: In the hitting set problem one is given m subsets of a finite set N and one has to find an X N of minimum cardinality that "hits" (intersects) all of them. The problem is NP-hard. It is not known whether there exists a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the hitting set problem with a finite performance ratio. Special cases of the hitting set problem are described for which finite performance ratios are guaranteed. These problems arise in a geometric setting. We consider special cases of the following problem: Given n compact subsets of R d , find a set of straight lines of minimum cardinality so that each of the given subsets is hit by at least one line. The algorithms are based on several techniques of representing objects by points, not necessarily points on the objects, and solving (in some cases, only approximately) the problem of hitting the representative points. Finite performance ratios are obtained when the dimension, the number of types of sets to be hit and the number of directions of the hitting lines are bounded.

Reference-contexts: Problem 2.1 is NP-hard even when all the line segments are horizontal with length 1 and their endpoints have integral coordinates (see Proposition 6.2 below). Thus, we are interested here in approximation algorithms. The following proposition follows immediately from the famous Konig-Egervary theorem <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> and the fact the max-flow problem can be solved in polynomial-time: 3 Proposition 2.2. The problem of hitting points in the plane with a minimum number of lines parallel to the axes can be solved in polynomial time. <p> Obviously, G is bipartite. It is easy to see that Problem 2.1 is equivalent to finding a minimum vertex cover in G. It is well known (see <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> ) that the latter can be solved in polynomial time as a maximum flow problem. It is interesting to note that the same problem in R 3 is NP-hard (see Proposition 6.4 below). We start with the case of line segments of equal lengths. <p> For simplicity, let a line segment [(a; b); (a+1; b)] be denoted [a; b].
