Title: Qualitative Reasoning about Imprecise Spatial Information

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of reasoning about imprecise spatial information. As a representation scheme we assume haze-points that are points surrounded by an area, the haze, denoting the imprecision that is associated with them. Haze-points are related by haze and precedence relations. Using these notions we can build higher dimension objects and relations [Top94a]. This paper focuses on reasoning about spatial imprecision which is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem over networks of constraints expressed in the language of haze-orders. The main contributions of this paper are (a) a set of preprocessing transformations that decrease the ambiguity which is introduced from unconditional transitivity over the haze relation, and (b) a graph-based data structure which is suitable for efficient inferencing of order relations.

Reference-contexts: Computing transitivities of spatial relations is generally impractical [Ran92].

Our solution to the problem of reasoning about "approximate" spatial relations is a combination of the previous two.

The rank of a node i is a value that each node is assigned depending on the order relations available in the haze-order graph.

This problem is challenging because of the ambiguity and uncertainty that is associated to the ends and distances of loci (genetic intervals). Haze orders and order graphs offer the right type of model and data structure for dealing with this problem.

Reference-contexts: Incorporating this ability into knowledge representation and reasoning models is a major issue for artificial intelligence research. In this paper we investigate this problem focusing on spatial knowledge. The haze-space ontology introduced in <ref> [Top94a] </ref> sets the formal framework for this work. In the haze-space ontology, space is viewed as a totality of spatial objects connected in terms of spatial relations. There are two types of objects: points and regions. <p> The discreteness assumption implies that g, the measure of the haze size, takes integer values. The orthogonality assumption implies that points and rectangles are interpreted over the cartesian plane. In <ref> [Top94a] </ref> we presented a set of spatial relations on points and regions that are defined in the haze-space ontology and admit approximate semantics. <p> An extensive discussion on the properties of the first order theory based on L A can be found in <ref> [Top94a] </ref>. Note that L A is a strictly qualitative formalism with a built-in parameter for imprecision. In the following we define a mapping from L A to the language of underlying space, L E . L E is used for defining the semantics of L A . <p> In our case, the additional parameter of grain clearly adds more complexity to the spatial relations transitivity. Our solution to the problem of reasoning about "approximate" spatial relations is a combination of the previous two. As we have shown in <ref> [Top94a] </ref>, the defined spatial relations in our model, are decomposed into a set of order and haze relations over two one dimensional coordinate spaces. Rea- soning with haze orders in one dimension was discussed in the earlier sections.

Reference-contexts: Although the discussion was centered in the one-dimensional case, we presented an abstract algorithm that addresses this problem in the context of two-dimensional spatial relations. Detailed discussion on the latter is presented in <ref> [Top94b] </ref>. The major contribution of this work is the definition of the preprocessing transformations that disambiguate haze relations by using the connectivity of the haze-order graph. These transformations always guarantee tighter and less ambiguous constraints between the graph nodes.
