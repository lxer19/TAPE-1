Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present two complementary patterns to build multi-expert systems, that is systems that need to integrate large, heterogeneous specialized modules, and implement complex, non deterministic control strategies. The first pattern summarizes the blackboard pattern presented in [1]. The second pattern builds on the model of dynamic control where a blackboard system has a repertoire of independent domain and control knowledge sources, a control plan expressing the system's desirable behavior, and a meta-controller that chooses at each point in time the currently enabled knowledge source that best matches the control plan. A system implementing this architectural pattern is able to dynamically change its control strategies as a response to unpredictable events.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The blackboard architectural pattern provides a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems that need to integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, non deterministic control strategies. This pattern, described in <ref> [1] </ref>, defines several components, of which the control component is the most important. Several models have been proposed to support the definition of this component that is key for the system's global properties. The purpose of this paper is to present two complementary patterns. <p> Several models have been proposed to support the definition of this component that is key for the system's global properties. The purpose of this paper is to present two complementary patterns. The first pattern summarizes the blackboard pattern presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. The second pattern is concerned with the blackboard pattern's control component. <p> Credits The blackboard model has been defined by the members of the HEARSAY-II project [2], and first applied on speech recognition. Comprehensive presentation of the blackboard paradigm and existing systems can be found in [5] [6]. The first pattern description of the blackboard model has been presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 3 Blackboard based control pattern Name Blackboard-based control Example Consider the autonomous robot running in an office environment introduced in the example section of the blackboard pattern. <p> Known Uses 7 This pattern for control has been used for ten years in numerous domains, including autonomous robots [7], systems for monitoring medical patients [8], and pilot's associate systems. Consequences This pattern presents the usual properties of blackboard systems as given in <ref> [1] </ref>. In particular, it provides a framework in which appropriate sets of knowledge sources can be selected and configured at both design time and run time. The integration of knowledge sources is actually very simple since knowledge sources are considered independently and are only characterized by their own properties.

Reference-contexts: Tuning heuristics is a very time-consuming activity. It is however a crucial setting that determines the system's suitability. Known Uses Blackboard-based systems have been used in numerous domains, including: * Speech recognition <ref> [2] </ref> * Vehicle identification and tracking [3] * Identification of the structure of protein molecules [4] * Sonar signals interpretation [5] Consequences The blackboard model provides effective solution to the design and implementation of complex systems where heterogeneous modules have to be dynamically combined to solve a problem. <p> The blackboard architectural pattern has also some weaknesses. The main one is certainly the difficulty of defining a good control strategy. Control is based on heuristics tuning that can only be obtained through experiments.

Reference-contexts: Such specializations can be done by plugging the adequate domain knowledge sources and control strategies in control knowledge sources. See Also The PRS system (Procedural Reasoning System) <ref> [9] </ref> implements a view of dynamic control very close to the one presented in this paper. PRS is a generic architecture that can both react rapidly to unanticipated changes in the environment and perform goal-directed reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Control plan corresponds to the goal under consideration at each control cycle of PRS. PRS has been applied in many fields, including telecommunication applications. Credits 8 The blackboard-based control model has been designed and developed at Stanford University by Barbara Hayes--Roth <ref> [10] </ref>. Over the years, several experiments on real-world applications have been conducted in order to validate the model and to show the wide variety of domains that can be tackled with this approach. 4 Conclusion This paper presents a very first step towards a pattern language to define multi-expert systems.
