Abstract: An effective network-based learning environment provides synchronous and asynchronous education to learners who are physically remote from or opt to telecommute to the base location of instruction. The environment provides content creation, user registration, course material storage, multiple delivery means, and end-user viewing tools. An intriguing aspect of the environment is how to model a lecture in terms of pre-, in-, and post-class information. We regard a lecture model collectively as an activity consisting of three elements: lecture materials, lecture presentation, and lecture interaction. These elements have their semantic meanings and relationships. The lecture model deserves a formal specification to describe its behavior and a structural representation in the hypermedia repository to organize the presentation information so that it can be truthfully reproduce in an asynchronous learning environment. We derive the synchronization specification for the media objects and define Strong-Weak Networked Hyperlink (SWNH) to represent the lecture structure and inter/intra media object reference in the distributed network environment. The specification and representation exhibit an object-oriented modular design, which is simple, but powerful enough, to aid on policy decisions such as prefetching, caching, and versioning control. The presentation of the lecture embody both the event-driven and timeline-based presentation synchronization where the browsing and authoring tools developed earlier fit right into the learning environment, e.g. FLIPS and HQT by the authors, or are immediately available through other providers, e.g. Web browsers.

Reference-contexts: The system built for the learning enviroment delivers education materials to users with a variety of technological combinations, ranging from traditional paper forms to video-based hypermedia <ref> [1] </ref>. The focus in this work is to discuss the key issues in the Education-on-Demand system organization and propose a lecture model along with formal specification and structural representation to provide quality network-based learning environment. <p> Along with the system organization and lecture model, enhancement to existing educational toolset and creating an integrated learning package in an asynchronous or synchronous environment are our immediate goals to achieve <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. As opposed to the first generation Web system, we are looking into the emerging next generation Web service as part of the Education-on-Demand service infrastructure. <p> &lt;slide-set&gt; &lt;container&gt; ::= &lt;subject&gt; &lt;container&gt; | NULL &lt;subject&gt; ::= &lt;Materials&gt; &lt;Presentation&gt; ::= - [&lt;media_list&gt;], &lt;sync&gt; - &lt;media_list&gt; ::= &lt;media&gt; | &lt;media&gt;, &lt;media_list&gt; &lt;media&gt; ::= SLIDE | VIDEO | AUDIO | IMAGE | APPLET &lt;sync&gt; ::= FLIPS_SYNC | TIMELINE_SYNC &lt;Interaction&gt; ::= Q&A | E-MAIL | DISCUSSION 10 model, e.g., HQT model <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition, we use the exmaple shown in Figure 3 to outline the mechanism of how to integrate both the lecture materials and the lecture presentation into a coherent unit. This exmaple uses a HQT timeline representation to model the lecture presentation. <p> In particular, several features are considered on the server such as video delivery, lecture database and certification authority system. We have developed two presentation and authoring tools for the learning environment: FLIPS [8] and Hyper QuickTime <ref> [1] </ref>. They use different synchronization approaches between medias where FLIPS is event-driven and Hyper QuickTime is timeline-based. The instructors can choose a suitable one according to their needs. By plugging in the two synchronization schemes, our lecture model provides flexibility to different presentation requirements.

Reference-contexts: Internal Revenue Services (IRS), Library of Congress, CNN, etc., are going on-line. Their presence effectively serves the people and customers through the Web and conserves the earth through paper reduction. Electronic commerce and information exchange in a paperless environment have thus begun. CNN NEWSROOM <ref> [2] </ref> is an encouraging example which distributes a 15 minute-per-day commercial free video program through the Web. Primary and secondary schools use the system as a teaching aid where improvements have been noted. However, it is not the primary means for classroom education.

Reference-contexts: Education in the information age involves people with variety of needs and objectives: those who need up-to-date knowledge and skill; those who are lifelong learners; and those who may be limited in their ability to access the traditional classroom means of education by physical restrictions <ref> [3] </ref>. Moreover, access to the educational media and resource in the learning environment requires state-of-the-art service infrastructure and commodity receiving-end means for the users. Desktop computing has transformed from text-based environment to graphics-based multimedia add-on environment. Human beings perceive picture, graphics, animation, audio, and video better than plain text.

Reference-contexts: The learners could easily get lost if the pages are not well designed and organized. Also, how to synchronize education medias, e.g. video and Web page, in the Web-based environment is an intriguing issue. Extensive survey on multimedia synchronization can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. In order to overcome the technical barriers, there are a number of rudimentary issues yet to be resolved that involve the creation, reuse, store, and delivery of the lecture information and lecture interaction.
