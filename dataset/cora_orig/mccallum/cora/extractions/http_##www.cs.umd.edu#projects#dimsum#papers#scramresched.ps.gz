Abstract: Distributed databases operating over wide-area networks such as the Internet, must deal with the unpredictable nature of the performance of communication. The response times of accessing remote sources can vary widely due to network congestion, link failure, and other problems. In such an unpredictable environment, the traditional iterator-based query execution model performs poorly. We have developed a class of methods, called query scrambling, for dealing explicitly with the problem of unpredictable response times. Query scrambling dynamically modifies query execution plans on-the-fly in reaction to unexpected delays in data access. In this paper we focus on the dynamic scheduling of query operators in the context of query scrambling. We explore various choices for dynamic scheduling and examine, through a detailed simulation, the effects of these choices. Our experimental environment considers pipelined and non-pipelined join processing in a client with multiple remote data sources and delayed or possibly bursty arrivals of data. Our performance results show that scrambling rescheduling is effective in hiding the impact of delays on query response time for a number of different delay scenarios.

Reference-contexts: A Reactive Approach Query scrambling shares some common goals with other approaches to dynamic query processing. In general, methods that attack poor run-time performance for queries fall into two broad categories: proactive and reactive. Proactive methods (e.g., <ref> [1, 10, 19] </ref>) attempt at compile-time to predict the behavior of query execution and plan ahead for possible contingencies. These approaches use a form of late binding in order to postpone making certain execution choices until the state of the system can be assessed at run-time. <p> The Volcano [10, 13] system compiles choose-plan operators into the query tree at optimization time. These operators are bound to a particular query execution plan before the query is executed. HERMES <ref> [1] </ref> records a history of the costs of remote accesses, and uses the history to better estimate the costs of future accesses. Mariposa [19] builds query plans after having negotiated a price-performance trade-off with data providers.

Reference-contexts: That is, a query can execute in the presence of certain delays with little or no response time penalty observable to the user. 1.1. Coping With Bursty Arrival In a previous paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we identified three types of delay that can arise when requesting data from remote sources: Initial Delay There is an unexpected delay in the arrival of the first tuple from a particular remote source. <p> Bursty Arrival Data is arriving at an unpredictable rate, typically with bursts of data followed by long periods of no arrivals. This problem can arise from fluctuating resource demands and the lack of a global scheduling mechanism in the wide-area environment. The algorithm presented in <ref> [2] </ref> focused on the problem of Initial Delay. As such, it was assumed that once data started to arrive from a remote source, the remaining data from that source would arrive in an uninterrupted fashion. <p> In general, scrambling involves rescheduling the execution order of operators, changing the actual operators themselves, and modifying the shape of the query tree to cope with delays <ref> [2, 23] </ref>. In this paper, our focus is on the first aspect of scrambling, namely, rescheduling. That is, we examine various policies for changing the scheduling of operators in a particular query execution tree, without creating new operators or modifying the shape of the tree. 10 Table 1. <p> The scheduler's objective is to maximize the overall system throughput. As stated in Section 1, the work described here builds on our initial definition of Query Scrambling <ref> [2] </ref>. Additional experimental results are also available in [3]. 30 8. Conclusions Query scrambling is a reactive technique for coping with unpredictable delays for wide-area remote data access.

Conclusions Query scrambling is a reactive technique for coping with unpredictable delays for wide-area remote data access. Query scrambling, in its most general sense, monitors query execution and reacts to delays by on-the-fly rescheduling query operators and possibly synthesizing new operators to run.

Reference-contexts: These approaches use a form of late binding in order to postpone making certain execution choices until the state of the system can be assessed at run-time. Typically the binding is done immediately prior to executing the compiled plan, and remains fixed for the entire execution. Reactive methods (e.g., <ref> [20, 4, 16] </ref>) monitor the behavior of the run-time system during query execution. When a significant event is detected, the run-time system reacts to the event. Query scrambling is a reactive approach | the query execution is changed on-the-fly in response to run-time events. <p> A similar approach is used in Rdb/VMS <ref> [4] </ref>. Both InterViso [20] and MOOD [16] are heterogeneous distributed databases that perform query optimization while the query is executing. Heterogeneous distributed databases divide a query into a collection of subqueries and a composition query.

In general, if n remote sources are subject to significant, independent delays, then by accessing those sources in parallel, scrambling has the potential to improve performance (over not scrambling) by as much as n times. 4.

In this article, we focus on query processing using a data-shipping or hybrid-shipping approach [12], where data is ultimately collected from remote sources and integrated at the query source. <p> Query Scrambling for Iterator-Based Execution Engines Rather than relying on the operating system, most database systems provide their own execution engine, which performs scheduling and memory management for the operators of compiled query plans. The iterator model is one way to structure such an execution engine <ref> [13] </ref>. In this model, each node of the query tree is an iterator. Iterators support three different calls: open () to prepare an operator for producing data; next () to produce a single tuple, and close () to perform final housekeeping. <p> Proactive techniques attempt to predict the possible states of the system that may arise at query run-time, and construct alternatives that can be used based on the actual observed state at the time a query is scheduled to execute. The Volcano <ref> [10, 13] </ref> system compiles choose-plan operators into the query tree at optimization time. These operators are bound to a particular query execution plan before the query is executed.

The experiments use a simplification of query Q2 of the TPC-D benchmark <ref> [22] </ref>. We chose this query because it is relatively simple, yet processes a five-way join.
