Abstract: A full tactile sensing suite for the finger segments and palm of the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand is presented. The rubber-based sensors employ capacitance sensing and floating electrodes in the top layer, and contain local electronics for excitation, filtering, analog-to-digital conversion, and serial communication. Experimental results on static, dynamic, and spatial properties are presented. Use of the tactile sensor in contact force control is demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the use of a tactile sensor in contact force control is demonstrated. 2 System Description The sensor technology is comprised of capacitance sensing and arrays, defined in rubber layers. The development is similar to that proposed by <ref> [1] </ref>, in that floating electrodes (Figure 2) are employed in the top layer rather than conductive strips as in [3, 11, 10]. The reason is for greater robustness, because of the possibility of contact breakage with conductive strips. The drawback is a smaller signal.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Tactile sensor development remains an enigma for robotics. While many laboratory prototypes have been proposed <ref> [2, 4, 5, 9] </ref>, and occasionally some commercial product appears, the perception nevertheless is that there are not good off-the-shelf sensors to be found. Consequently multi-fingered robot hands or other grippers mostly do without tactile sensors, while those that do incorporate them are not entirely satisfactory.

Reference-contexts: Due to the high freqency disturbances caused by the compliance of the sensor and the manipulator itself, the force controller is usually unstable. One of the simplest and most commmonly used methods employs a dominant pole to the system plus lowpass filtering to the force feedback signal <ref> [12] </ref>. The disadvantage of this method is sacrificing the bandwidth of the controller. Using a tactile sensor as the force feedback device has two advantages which can result in a much more stable force controller.
