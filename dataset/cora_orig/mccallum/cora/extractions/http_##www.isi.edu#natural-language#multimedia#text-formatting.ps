Abstract: Automatic Generation of Formatted Text Very few texts longer than a paragraph are written without appropriate formatting. To ensure readability, automated text generation programs must not only plan and generate their texts but be able to format them appropriately as well. We describe how work on the automated planning of multisentence text and on the display of information in a multimedia system led to the insight that text formatting devices such as footnotes, italicized regions, enumerations, etc., can be planned automatically by a text structure planning process. This is achieved by recognizing that each formatting device fulfills a specific communicative function in a text, and that such functions can be defined in terms of the text structure relations used as plans in a text planning system. An example is presented in which a text is planned from a semantic representation to a final form that includes English sentences and L T E X formatting commands, intermingled as A more interesting question is: How? That is, how do writers know what device to use at each point? How is device selection integrated with the text production process in general? Can the two processes be automated | can a text production system be made to plan not only the content and structure of the text but also the appropriate textual formatting for it? The answer is yes, and this paper describes an experiment that demonstrates this ability. Though manuals of style (such as [CMS 82, APA 83, Van Leunen 79]) may seem relevant, they contain little more than precise descriptions of the preferred forms of textual devices in fact. Their recommendations of use, when provided, are not detailed enough to help in the selection process itself. Instead, our approach to this problem builds upon ideas and techniques proven useful for multisentence text generation (specifically, text planning) and multimedia communication planning (specifically, the problem of best integrating different media, such as language, diagrams, tables, maps, etc., into a single coherent display). In research on these two questions, we came to realize that the problem of text formatting forms a natural point midway between pure text planning on the one hand and pure multimedia display planning on the other: though text formatting devices have features that make them resemble different media (two-dimensional offset in some cases, highlighting in others, etc.), they remain essentially textual. This similarity enabled us to extend some of the previous work on text planning done at USC/ISI (see [Hovy 88a, Moore & Paris 89]) over the past several years to perform not only standard text structure planning but also text formatting. The next section describes our characterization of text formatting devices. The section that follows it describes how we extended our text planner to handle the requirements of text layout, including an example of the generation, from a semantic representation, of a formatted segment of an Air Traffic Control manual | the type of document which would be difficult to comprehend without appropriate textual devices. The appropriate.
