Title: NIFDY: A Low Overhead, High Throughput Network Interface  
Author: Timothy Callahan and Seth Copen Goldstein 
Address: California-Berkeley  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of  
Abstract: In this paper we present NIFDY, a network interface that uses admission control to reduce congestion and ensures that packets are received by a processor in the order in which they were sent, even if the underlying network delivers the packets out of order. The basic idea behind NIFDY is that each processor is allowed to have at most one outstanding packet to any other processor unless the destination processor has granted the sender the right to send multiple unacknowledged packets. Further, there is a low upper limit on the number of outstanding packets to all processors. We present results from simulations of a variety of networks (meshes, tori, butterflies, and fat trees) and traffic patterns to verify NIFDY's efficacy. Our simulations show that NIFDY increases throughput and decreases overhead. The utility of NIFDY increases as a network's bisection bandwidth decreases. When combined with the increased payload allowed by in-order delivery NIFDY increases total bandwidth delivered for all networks. The resources needed to implement NIFDY are small and constant with respect to network size.

Reference-contexts: Interconnection networks deliver maximum performance when the offered load is limited to a fraction of the maximum bandwidth. We call this the operating range of the network. Many people have observed that when the offered load exceeds the operating range, throughput falls off dramatically <ref> [Jac88, Jai90, SS89, RJ90, KS91, Aga91, BK94] </ref>. Researchers have investigated this problem for both WAN and MPP networks. The WAN solutions are based on deep networks with long messages and generally use software protocols at the end points [Jac88, RJ90, KMCL93, SBB + 91].

Packet size is eight words including header. * The cyclic-shift all-to-all communication pattern described in <ref> [BK94] </ref>. <p> In these cases the per-node bandwidth would have to decrease as the machine size grows in order to avoid congestion at the bisection, making smaller values of O and B more desirable. 4.3 Cyclic Shift In this subsection we consider a specific traffic pattern, the cyclic shift (C-shift) studied in <ref> [BK94] </ref>, which provides all-to-all communication. We implemented this traffic pattern using the real traffic interface to our simulator and the CM-5-style network in order to make comparisons with [BK94]. The C-shift communication pattern consists of P 1 phases. <p> and B more desirable. 4.3 Cyclic Shift In this subsection we consider a specific traffic pattern, the cyclic shift (C-shift) studied in <ref> [BK94] </ref>, which provides all-to-all communication. We implemented this traffic pattern using the real traffic interface to our simulator and the CM-5-style network in order to make comparisons with [BK94]. The C-shift communication pattern consists of P 1 phases. In the first phase, processor i sends to processor (i + 1) mod P ; in phase p, processor i sends to processor (i + p) mod P ; until p = P 1. <p> As long as the phases remain separate, each receiver is matched with exactly one sender. However, as observed in <ref> [BK94] </ref>, some nodes may finish the current phase early and move to the next phase, resulting in one node receiving from two senders. This slows the progress of both senders, allowing other senders to catch up and aggravating the condition. <p> This slows the progress of both senders, allowing other senders to catch up and aggravating the condition. Figure 5 shows the number of packets in the network for each receiver as the pattern progresses, clearly indicating the accumulation of packets outside certain receivers. One solution used in Strata <ref> [BK94] </ref> is to insert global barriers between phases. Results are summarized in Figure 6. Using NIFDY's congestion control alone results in better performance than optimized barriers. When NIFDY's in-order delivery is exploited, the benefit is even greater. These results can be explained by looking at Figure 5. <p> However, CR, unlike NIFDY, can be used with networks that are not deadlock-free. Finally, there are many software techniques that can be used to reduce network congestion <ref> [BK94] </ref>. These techniques, such as structuring communication as series of permutations allowing one-on-one transfers, are beneficial even with NIFDY. However, NIFDY will add robustness to the system and be especially effective with traffic patterns that are difficult for software to manage, in particular those with no global structure.

Reference-contexts: The Synoptics ATM Switch routes packets adaptively within the switch and then reorders them before they leave the switch. This link-by-link reordering increases the latency of the switch by a factor of five <ref> [BT89] </ref>. From these observations we conclude that reordering should be performed only once, at the destination, and that if possible the reordering should be performed in hardware. 1.2 NIFDY in a Nutshell NIFDY is a network interface that uses admission control to perform both in-order delivery and end-to-end flow control.

Once the library takes advantage of the in-order delivery provided by NIFDY, it outperforms the buffers-only configuration in all cases. 4.5 Radix Sort Finally, we ran simulations of a radix sort based on <ref> [Dus94] </ref>. Each iteration of radix sort consists of two communication phases: scan and coalesce. In the scan phase, a scan addition is performed across all processors for each bucket; this involves nearest-neighbor communication.

Reference-contexts: While METRO requires nontrivial intelligence at the transfer endpoints, its key characteristics arise from its router design. NIFDY, in contrast, can be used with a variety of networks. Compressionless Routing (CR) <ref> [KLC94] </ref> also provides in-order delivery. CR, which relies on wormhole routing, pads packets with enough space to ensure that pushing the entire packet onto the network implies that the head of the packet has already entered the destination, at which point the packet is guaranteed to be completely consumed.

Reference-contexts: For instance, 51% of the request messages in the Split-C library include the source processor ID in the message. The generic active message specification requires that all request messages include the source ID <ref> [Mar] </ref>. In all these cases, the source ID required in the packet header by NIFDY could be put to good use. Thus, NIFDY's requirement of including the source ID in every packet does not actually increase overhead.
