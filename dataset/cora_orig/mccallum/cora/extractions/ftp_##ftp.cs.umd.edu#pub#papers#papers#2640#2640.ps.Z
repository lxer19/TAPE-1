Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the SVD is difficult to update and all known SVD updating schemes require O (N 3 ) operations for a mfiN matrix <ref> [1] </ref>. Because of this difficulty, rank revealing QR decompositions [2] have received renewed interest. However, the QR decomposition does not provide an explicit basis for the orthogonal sub-space. Recently, a new rank revealing decomposition, the URV decomposition (URVD) [3], has been developed.

Reference-contexts: Because of this difficulty, rank revealing QR decompositions [2] have received renewed interest. However, the QR decomposition does not provide an explicit basis for the orthogonal sub-space. Recently, a new rank revealing decomposition, the URV decomposition (URVD) <ref> [3] </ref>, has been developed. It can be updated in O (N 2 ) time, and provides 1 2 DOA Estimation a basis for orthogonal subspace. In this paper the URVD will be described along with some simulation results for the DOA estimation problem. <p> Since the URVD has applications beyond DOA estimation, we will adopt a neutral notation and work with an n fi p matrix A. Owing to space limitations, we can give only a sketch of the decomposition and the updating algorithm. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for details. 1 Throughout this paper k k will denote the Frobenius norm defined by kAk 2 = i;j The smallest singular value of a matrix will be written as inf (A). 2. The URV Decomposition Suppose that A has rank K. <p> Note that because fi &lt; 1, the triangular factor of the URVD remains bounded as long as the signals remain bounded. Thus a tolerance can be chosen based on the size of the noise (for one such choice see <ref> [3] </ref>). The MUSIC algorithm was chosen here to illustrate a high resolution DOA estimator based on the URVD.

Reference-contexts: An algorithm to compute a rank revealing URVD of a K fi K upper triangular matrix R is given next. The first step is to determine if R is defective in rank. This problem can be solved by means of a condition estimator <ref> [4] </ref>, which produce in O (K 2 ) time a vector w of norm one such that kRwk ~ = inf (R): The next step uses plane rotations [5] to reduce all but the last component of w to zero.

Specifically, we determine a sequence V H 1 ; V H K1 , of rotations that eliminate the first K 1 component of w, so that w is zero except for one in its last component.

Reference-contexts: In the interest of space the reader is referred to [7] for additional details on the signal model and signal covariance matrix. As mentioned, we may obtain the estimate of the orthogonal subspace required for DOA estimation from the covariance matrix <ref> [6] </ref> or from the data matrix.
