Abstract: An axi-symmetric and swirling vortex sheet is investigated as the simplest flow in which there is non-trivial vortex stretching and as a possible setting for studying vortex cancellation and singularity formation. Rayleigh's criterion indicates linear stability of a single sheet but instability for other configurations of sheets. Due to the simplicity of vortex sheet problems, the linear modes and growth rates (or frequencies) can be explicitly expressed. Subsequent nonlinear evolution is numerically simulated using a vortex method. The numerical results

For similar reasons, there have been a number of recent computational studies of smooth axi-symmetric flow with swirl <ref> [3, 11, 16, 22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More importantly, the "ffi-smoothing" removes the unboundedness of the growth rates at large k. In the case of 2-d planar sheets it has also been shown that an analogous regularization gives global analyticity of the sheet motion <ref> [6] </ref>. While smoother data, or the inclusion of viscosity, are more natural regularizations, it has been seen that "ffi-smoothing" captures the qualitative features of smoother flows [13].

Reference-contexts: The generalization of (1.1)-(1.3) to configurations of more than 1 sheet is straightforward. For the case of an axi-symmetric vortex sheet without swirl, these equations were derived earlier by de Bernardinis and Moore [9] and used in <ref> [8, 19, 20, 21] </ref>. The steady flow solution (z; r; ) = (ff; R; t=(4R 2 )) for (1.1)-(1.3) is linearly stable to axi-symmetric disturbances, but flows with multiple vortex sheets can be linearly unstable, as described in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for this steady flow is then in the x y plane, and so it is not excited by perturbations that are axi-symmetric. In this section a linearized stability analysis is presented for axi-symmetric perturbations of cylindrical sheets in several configurations. Rayleigh's criterion <ref> [10] </ref> provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for linear stability of a steady swirling flow to axi-symmetric perturbations; namely the flow is stable if and only if the square of the circulation is a nondecreasing function of the radius.
