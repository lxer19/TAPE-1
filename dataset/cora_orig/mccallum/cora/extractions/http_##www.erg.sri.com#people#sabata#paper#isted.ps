Abstract: We present a transport protocol that uses IP multicasting to provide reliable multicast transport services for multimedia applications. The Transport Protocol for Reliable Multicast (TRM), like IP multicasting and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), has a receiver-oriented style of defining group membership and the lack of group information at the source. The distributed nature of the group membership information within TRM ensures scalability, which we believe is an important requirement. TRM uses a many-to-many communication model in which any of the participants can become a source of data. TRM guarantees the statistical reliability of message delivery without any guarantee of the reliability of the group membership. Group management and group membership functions are handled by the session layer and the application. TRM delegates the responsibility of ensuring reliable message delivery to the receivers, which use a negative acknowledgment (NACK)based scheme with message damping to request retransmissions of missing data. The sources send heartbeats periodically (to the multicast group) to let every member of the group know about its own state when there is no data to transmit. TRM also supports late joins, early leaves, and source-specific joins.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper presents a transport protocol that uses IP multicasting to provide reliable multicast transport services for multimedia applications. IP multicasting provides the routing required for multidestination delivery to multiple destinations. In general, multimedia applications such as audio-video conferencing do not need reliable transport services <ref> [1] </ref>. However, collaborative applications using white boards and shared editors require reliability. The driving application for our protocol design effort has been the shared white board application [2; 3].

A fundamental design decision for the Transport Protocol for Reliable Multicast (TRM) was to adopt a negative acknowledgement (NACK)based scheme for message reliability.

Reference-contexts: The receiver sends this request in the form of a NACK. The NACK is sent over the IP multicast group, in such a way (by a damping technique) that other hosts can see the request and refrain from transmitting the same request <ref> [4] </ref>. To reduce the likelihood of implosion, each receiver refrains from sending a NACK as soon as it detects missing data. Instead, it listens for NACKs from other receivers. The receiver finally sends a NACK only if no other host sends one within the waiting period.
