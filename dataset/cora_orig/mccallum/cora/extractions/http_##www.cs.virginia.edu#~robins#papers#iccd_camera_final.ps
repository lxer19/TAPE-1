Abstract: We address the efficient construction of interconnection trees with near-optimal delays. We study the accuracy and fidelity of easily-computed delay models with respect to detailed simulation (e.g., SPICE-computed delays). We show that Elmore delay minimization is a high-fidelity interconnect objective for IC interconnect technologies, and propose a greedy low delay tree (LDT) heuristic which for any monotone delay function can efficiently minimize maximum delay. For comparison, we also generate optimal routing trees (ORTs) with respect to Elmore delay, using branch-and-bound search. Experimental results show that the LDT heuristic approximates ORTs very accurately: for nets with up to 7 pins, LDT trees have a maximum sink delay within 2:3% of optimum on average. Moreover, compared with minimum spanning tree constructions, the LDT achieves average reductions in delay of up to 35% depending on the net size.

Table 5 compares delays in Elmore-based LDTs with those of the MST and AHHK <ref> [1] </ref> constructions for nets of up to 17 pins using the same IC parameters. All delays in the table are calculated using the Two-Pole simulator. <p> In addition, LDT achieves reductions in delay of up to 35% (depending on the net size) over the MST routing, as measured by the Two-Pole simulator. Significant reductions are also achieved compared to AHHK- <ref> [1] </ref> and SPT-based routings. LDT is formulated to construct a spanning tree, but can easily be extended to yield a Steiner Low Delay Tree (SLDT) algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Note that despite BBORT's pruning of the solution space, its worst-case time complexity is still exponential. To avoid the exponential running time of BBORT, we propose the following greedy heuristic to approximate ORTs. Our method is analogous to Prim's minimum spanning tree construction <ref> [14] </ref>: starting with a trivial tree containing only the source, we iteratively find a pin n i in the tree and a sink n j outside the tree so that adding edge e ij yields a tree with minimum delay.
