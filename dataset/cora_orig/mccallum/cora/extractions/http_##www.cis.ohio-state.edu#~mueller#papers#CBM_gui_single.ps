Abstract: A medical workstation has been developed for the efficient display and analysis of large sets of digital cineradiographic images. Various features aid the clinician in quickly identifying and extracting the image information relevant for diagnosis: animated viewing of image frames, a digital magnifying glass for local image enlargement and enhancement, a special review queue for critical image frames, and task-oriented image processing. Double frame buffering and direct memory addressing ensure fast, artifact-free image display and transfer. Much freedom is provided for adapting the system to ones own preferences. A statistical analysis of extensive tests conducted by eight clinical expert reviewers is given.

Reference-contexts: In OOD, a software system is decomposed into a hierarchy of self-contained objects that possess certain functionality. The OOD paradigm is increasingly used in software design in an effort to make software reusable and easily expandable into a common framework. The MedStation PACS <ref> [9] </ref> (from the University of Tbingen, Germany) is another example for such a system. By using OOD, new modules, e.g. for image processing or image file transfers, can be easily incorporated.

Reference-contexts: This study was motivated by a number of occurrences of, so-called, Single Leg Separation (SLS) in these heart valves <ref> [10] </ref>. The SLS condition describes a valve where one of the two legs of the outlet strut, which, along with the inlet strut, holds the disc in place, breaks away from the ange. The second leg remains intact, and the valve continues to function normally.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 depicts a sketch of a BSCC valve (without the disc) illustrating the locations of a possible SLS. In Fig. 3, an X-ray image of a BSCC valve acquired in a direct en-face viewing angle (also called tunnel view <ref> [11] </ref>) is shown. Due to the high incidence of patient morbidity and mortality associated with reoperative valve replacement, prophylactic valve replacement was generally not recommended [12]. Instead, it was deemed more advisable to routinely monitor the patients by acoustic [13] or radiographic [14] procedures.

Reference-contexts: This rather small width of the SLS 5 necessitates the use of high resolution imaging techniques. The first study (subject to a future publication, see <ref> [18] </ref>) utilizing the medical workstation compared two different imaging modalities using either a modified X-ray cineangiographic system (based on the Siemens DIMA Hicor) or a newly developed prototype of a high magnification Xray system (manufactured by Feinfocus, Germany). <p> In this paper, we will solely focus on results related to the third item on this list, while the first two topics will be subject of a future publication <ref> [18] </ref>. The outcome of the study dealing with the clinicians interaction with the software was then to be utilized to define the final implementation of the clinical workstation.

Reference-contexts: An automated procedure <ref> [19] </ref> can be applied to identify the exact location of the strut-ange interface, which then is used as the ROIs center point around which the filtered and magnified subimages were computed.

Reference-contexts: As clinical workstations are in many cases applied in a high volume routine setting, it may often be worth the effort to develop methods similar to the ones we have used. The many advances made in todays medical knowledge-based systems (see e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>) will undoubtedly facilitate this task. This pre-processing step, which also included the computation of the spatially compressed preview images, required less than 1 hour per image set and was usually done as a batch process over night.

Reference-contexts: All images are stored in an array of X Window pixmap resources. In X Windows (see e.g <ref> [21] </ref>), pixmaps are treated like invisible windows that are resident on the display workstation. Their contents can be rapidly copied to the screen. By storing a series of images in pixmaps one is able to animate even large images at a very high rate.

Reference-contexts: The new image is only unveiled to the user after writing to the back frame buffer is completed. As standard X Windows (X11, Release 6) does not provide true double frame buffering, we have implemented double frame buffering with OpenGL <ref> [24] </ref> on the SGI version of our software. OpenGL is the portable version of the graphics library GL that was originally developed by SGI. This standard has recently been adopted by a variety of other workstation manufacturers implementing OpenGL either in software or with add-on hardware.

Reference-contexts: The Xray images in our study contained a considerable amount of quantum noise. Our system provides Fig. 3. The graphical user interface in Single View Mode. 9 an adaptive trimmed mean filter <ref> [26] </ref> that is particularly designed to preserve edges while removing background noise. The filter is locally applied in the same fashion as the magnification feature described earlier, but triggered by the center mouse button.

Reference-contexts: While this filter works best for our application, other filters are under consideration, such as a Laplacian edge detector, a median low-pass filter, an adaptive contrast enhancement, or a thresholding operator (see, e.g., <ref> [27] </ref>). The system also provides a magnified version of the processed area by depressing the right mouse button. Fig. 4.
