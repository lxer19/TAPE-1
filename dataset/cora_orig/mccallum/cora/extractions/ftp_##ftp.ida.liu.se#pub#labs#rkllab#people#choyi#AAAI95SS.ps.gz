Title: Towards the Assessment of Logics for Concurrent Actions  
Author: Choong-Ho Yi 
Address: 581 83 Linkoping, Sweden  
Affiliation: Department of Computer and Information Science Linkoping University  
Abstract: We have introduced concurrency into the framework of Sandewall. The resulting formalism is capable of reasoning about interdependent as well as independent concurrent actions. Following Sandewall's systematical method, we have then applied the entailment criterion PCM to selecting intended models of common sense theories where concurrent actions are allowed, and proved that the criterion leads to only intended models for a subset of such theories.

Reference-contexts: C is a set of tuples hs; Ei where s is start time and s n, i.e. a set of actions which have been started but not terminated yet at time n. 1 The presentation in this section is mainly based on <ref> (Sandewall 1993) </ref>. The tuple hB; M; R; A; Ci works as a "game board" in the game; the ego and the world alternate and extend it such that, roughly, the world executes the actions which are evoked by the ego.

Reference-contexts: hM; Ri be an interpretation, then the breakset of I at time t is defined as a set of features which change value from time t 1 to t; formally breakset (I; t) = ff i j R (f i ; t 1) 6= R (f i ; t)g: Definition <ref> (Sandewall 1994) </ref> Let I = hM; Ri and I 0 = hM 0 ; R 0 i be interpretations, then I is said to be PCM-preferred over I 0 , written as I t pcm I 0 , iff M = M 0 and there is some time point t such <p> For the detailed discussion and the full proofs, please refer to <ref> (Sandewall 1994) </ref>. Concurrency in the Trajectory Semantics In Sandewall (1994) the trajectory semantics was defined with the restriction that only sequential actions are allowed, i.e. at most one action is considered at a time. However, in dealing with concurrent actions new problems arise which were not there for sequential actions.

Reference-contexts: By this time, however, there has not been reported any systematic result in that direction. Actually, in contrast to the case for sequential actions where several entailment criteria, e.g. chronologically maximal ignorance <ref> (Shoham 1988) </ref>, have been proposed for selecting intended models, no such method has been tested for dealing with concurrent actions. The work presented in this paper is an approach "in that direction" which has been done based directly on Sandewall.

Reference-contexts: It offers a clear and simple underlying semantics, and reduces the technical complexity. Following Sandewall, trajectory semantics world and ego are defined as follows. Formal definitions are given in <ref> (Yi 1995) </ref>. Trajectory Semantics World in a Single-timestep Ego-World Game As mentioned previously, the ego-world game is performed in terms of a finite development hB; M; R; A; Ci. <p> By generalizing Sandewall's proof of the correctness of PCM for KpIsAn, we have proven that PCM still obtains only intended models for the scenarios within the new class. For want of space, the full proofs and details are reserved in <ref> (Yi 1995) </ref>. Conclusion This work gives a base for analyzing the range of applicability of logics for concurrency.
