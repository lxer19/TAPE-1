Abstract: The Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network provides communication services with different requirements, including real-time services such as voice and video. Real-time services are affected by the probabilistic behavior of such a network. In particular, when the network becomes congested, the end-to-end packet delay may exceed the maximum allowed. Fortunately, many real-time services are willing to trade service quality for information timeliness. The imprecise-computation technique, in combination with layered coding schemes, makes this tradeoff possible.

Reference-contexts: Traffic peaks can temporarily saturate a switching node, causing network congestion. A consequence of network congestion is the potential failure to meeting timing requirements. This paper presents a congestion-control scheme based on the imprecise-computation technique <ref> [1] </ref> and shows that the scheme is effective in relieving network congestion due to fluctuations in real-time traffic. Section 2 discusses the applicability of the imprecise-computation technique to congestion control and the network architecture based on this technique. Section 3 presents the scheduling policy. <p> To assess the effectiveness of our congestion-control scheme, we present simulation results in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our work and outlines future work. 2 Congestion-Control Scheme A message containing related information, such as video frames, consists of a number of fixed-size packets. To apply the imprecise-computation technique <ref> [1] </ref> to control congestion, we divide the packets in each message into two types: mandatory and optional. The mandatory packets carry the basic-quality portion of the message.

Reference-contexts: The optional packets carry the extra-quality portion, the additional information needed to achieve full-service quality. Such a partition of packets can be achieved by using layered coding schemes <ref> [2] </ref>. Optional packets may be discarded, if necessary, so that the message and other messages can meet their deadlines. Our congestion-control scheme uses a two-level scheduling discipline | basic quality versus extra quality. This scheme provides different qualities of service to different traffic classes based on a priority-based scheduling policy.

Reference-contexts: The scheduling policy for the output system is a non-preemptive one (since packet transmission should 2 not be interrupted) based on a combination of the earliest-deadline-first algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>, a periodic-server scheme [8], and the imprecise-computation technique. Whenever the scheduler chooses to send real-time packets, the packet with the nearest absolute deadline among all packets in the real-time subbuffers is transmitted. Conflicts are resolved on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis.

To reduce the delay of these packets, a periodic server <ref> [8] </ref> is used. A periodic server is defined by its period and the percentage of bandwidth that it reserves for non-real-time packets.

Reference-contexts: We also recorded data on link utilization, subbuffer occupancy levels, packet delay through the output system, and packet-delay jitter. Due to space limitations, none of the results on buffer-occupancy levels and packet-delay jitters are presented here. They can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. For all the results presented here, the 90% confidence intervals are negligibly small. 4.1 Base Experiment Based on the work of [11, 12], we set the parameters for our base experiment (BE) to those listed in Table 2. <p> Due to space limitations, none of the results on buffer-occupancy levels and packet-delay jitters are presented here. They can be found in [11]. For all the results presented here, the 90% confidence intervals are negligibly small. 4.1 Base Experiment Based on the work of <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, we set the parameters for our base experiment (BE) to those listed in Table 2. When T h = 1, no packet is discarded, and hence the imprecision mechanism is not activated. <p> It exhibits the same behavior as the mean delay for video packets as the number of connections increases <ref> [11] </ref>. our base experiment with a video-predominant traffic load. For Th = 1, the miss ratio grows linearly with the number of connections. For finite values of Th, the shape of the curves depends strongly on the value of Th. <p> By using a smaller congestion threshold, both the packet delay and the number of invalid packets can be kept small <ref> [11] </ref>. We repeated the base experiment using a voice-predominant traffic load (BE;VoP). Unlike video predominance, we found that the effect of the imprecision mechanism is small. The reason for this difference between video predominance and voice predominance lies in the structure of the traffic. <p> When it does, the imprecision mechanism cannot stabilize the system as it did when the video-predominant traffic load was used. Consequently, all performance measures show only the first stable and the first unstable region <ref> [11] </ref>. 4.2 Experiments on System Parameters In a series of experiments, we changed each of the system parameters in turn while keeping the other parameters the same as in the base experiment. We first changed the imprecision ratio of the traffic sources to IR = 1=3. <p> However, the packet delay for video and voice packets are noticeably different from those found in the base experiment. The mean delay of video packets is slightly longer for the shorter relative deadlines while for voice packets the opposite is true <ref> [11] </ref>. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: The values of the relative deadlines affect the way that real-time packets are scheduled since the earliest-deadline-first algorithm is used. Suppose that a video packet and a voice packet have just arrived in empty buffers.
