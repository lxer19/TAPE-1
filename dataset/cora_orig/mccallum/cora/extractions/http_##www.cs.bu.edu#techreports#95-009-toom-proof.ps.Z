Title: A NEW VERSION OF TOOM'S PROOF  
Author: PETER G ACS 
Affiliation: BOSTON UNIVERSITY  
Abstract: There are several proofs now for the stability of Toom's example of a two-dimensional stable cellular automaton and its application to fault-tolerant computation. Simon and Berman simplified and strengthened Toom's original proof: the present report is simplified exposition of their proof.
