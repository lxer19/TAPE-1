Abstract: Recent developments in analyzing molecular structures and representing solid models using simplicial complexes have further enhanced the need for computing structural information about simplicial complexes in R 3 . This paper develops basic techniques required to manipulate and analyze structures of complexes in R 3 . A new approach to analyze simplicial complexes in Euclidean 3-space R 3 is described. First, methods from topology are used to analyze triangulated 3-manifolds in R 3 . Then it is shown that these methods can, in fact, be applied to arbitrary simplicial complexes in R 3 after (simulating) the process of thickening a complex to a 3-manifold homotopic to it. As a consequence considerable structural information about the complex can be determined and certain discrete problems solved as well. For example, it is shown how to determine the homology groups, as well as concrete representations of their generators, for a given complex in R 3 .

A knot is a subspace of R 3 that is homeomorphic to S 1 . A homotopy F : X fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> !

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the reduction of a matrix to its Smith normal form has a worst-case upper bound that is computationally prohibitive [10]. For recent improvements along this approach see [9]. Delfinado and Edelsbrunner <ref> [2] </ref> describe an algorithm, avoiding the computational bottleneck of reduction to Smith normal form, that computes the Betti numbers of a simplicial complex in R 3 . They assemble the complex incrementally simplex by simplex, and at each step update the Betti numbers of the current complex. <p> We describe algorithms to: 1. Determine the ranks of homology groups (Betti numbers) of a complex K in R 3 optimally in time and space linear in the size n of K. Although this algorithm is of the same complexity as that of <ref> [2] </ref> our new insight into the generators of the homology groups allows a somewhat simpler non-incremental algorithm that is different from [2]. 2. <p> Although this algorithm is of the same complexity as that of <ref> [2] </ref> our new insight into the generators of the homology groups allows a somewhat simpler non-incremental algorithm that is different from [2]. 2. <p> This eliminates the 1-cycle detection step from the algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref>. To find the generators for H 1 (K), as is evident from theorem 3.7, there are two major computational questions that we must first answer: 1. Given an embedding of K, how do we decide which of the bounding surfaces is the enclosing surface S r ? 2. <p> It may be intuitively clear that a hive can be thickened to a 3-manifold M homotopic to it. We shall see that the process of thickening may, in fact, be "simulated" without computing an explicit triangulation of M . This procedure is similar to the one described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Consider a triangle t of H and choose a vector ~n normal to t (ie., a choice of a side of t), such that t is not the face of a tetrahedron on that side. <p> Adjacencies of vertices in G are defined as above (the method in <ref> [2] </ref> considers a similar graph as well). Thus, if T is a triangulation of M , we have then an explicit triangulation @T of the boundary bd (M ) of M , except for the cases where these simulated surfaces meet at isolated vertices.
