Abstract: As the system clock speed increases, crosstalk becomes one of the major sources of noise which can limit the performance of high-speed digital systems in addition to delay and ringing. The congruence transformation can be used to decouple a coupled transmission-line system. In this paper, we extended the scattering parameter based macromodel to include the congruence transformation to analyze the crosstalk in the coupled transmission-line systems. After decouple the n coupled transmission lines using the congruence transformation, the computation of scattering matrix of the coupled transmission lines then becomes those of the scattering matrix of the congruence transformers and those of the n decoupled single transmission lines. A very simple scattering parameter description of the congruence transformer for coupled lossless transmission lines is derived. It has been extended to handle the coupled lossy transmission lines. Unlike some of the previous methods[14][16] which only consider the coupling between immediate adjacent lines, our method takes into account the coupling among all lines. We also present the results obtained from our simulator as well as those obtained from the SPICE-like simulators (for example: SPICE3e2 and ASTAP) and state- of-the-art moment-matching simulators (for example: SWEC and Coffee).

Previous research works which uses scattering parameter for the analysis of coupled transmission lines include those of the full-wave analysis by Cooke et al <ref> [6] </ref> and time domain simulation by Schutt-Aine et al [16].

An adoption of the scattering parameter based macromodel and Pade/EDPF approximation do provide a trade off between speed and accuracy. The difficulty in high-performance system design comes from the coupled noise among the transmission lines which are placed closely together in today's dense process technology. <p> For all the waveform plots, our method obtains results that match SPICE3e2 simulation results better than Schutt-Aine's. The total running time for this example is 4:4 seconds. 4.4 Example 4 The circuit and geometry parameters of Example 4 as shown in Figure 4.4 are taken from Cooke's paper <ref> [6] </ref>. The driving signal is 100-MHz 50% duty-cycle pulse with 0:1ns rise/fall time. The estimated harmonic bandwidth of this driving signal is well over 3:5-GHz. The geometry parameters are listed in the circuit schematic where all six transmission lines are uniform. <p> Two zoom in portion of the simulation waveforms are shown in Figure 4.5 (e) and (f). The ASTAP and Cooke's simulation waveforms are digitized from the results published in Cooke's paper <ref> [6] </ref> while the SWEC results are obtained from MCMC-94 benchmarks. The SWEC uses analytic method to find the derivatives of the admittance in order to compute the moments; because of the complexity, it only find lower order moments [13].
