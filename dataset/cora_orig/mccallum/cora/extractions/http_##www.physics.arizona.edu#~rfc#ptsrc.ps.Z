Reference-contexts: In addition, our _ M is more than 10 times larger than that permitted by the "mono-energetic" electron model of Sgr A* <ref> (Beckert, et al. 1996) </ref>. It appears that additional work is needed to reconcile disk models with the fact that the observed multiple wind sources result in a large mass accretion rate onto the central engine, if its mass is ~ 10 6 M fi .

Reference-contexts: Many of Sgr A*'s radiative characteristics may be due to its accretion of the IRS 16 wind. In the classical Bondi-Hoyle (BH) scenario <ref> (Bondi & Hoyle 1944) </ref>, the mass accretion rate for a uniform hypersonic flow is _ M BH = R A 2 m H n w v w , in terms of the accretion radius R A 2GM=v w 2 .

Reference-contexts: 1997) suggest that either (1) the circularized flow does not form an ff-disk, but rather advects most of its dissipated energy through the event horizon (e.g., Narayan, Yi, & Mahadevan 1995), (2) the Bondi-Hoyle flow merges into a massive, fossilized disk, storing most of the deposited matter at large radii <ref> (Falcke & Melia 1997) </ref>, or (3) Sgr A* is not a point-like object (Haller, et al. 1995). Added to this is the fact that in reality the flow past Sgr A* is not likely to be uniform.

Reference-contexts: More realistically, the inflow itself carries angular momentum, so that the formation of a disk-like structure at small radii (i.e., r 10 23 r g ) may be difficult to avoid <ref> (Melia 1994) </ref>. However, the observations do not appear to favor the presence of a standard ff-disk at small radii (Melia 1996). <p> The Calculational Algorithm and Physical Setup Although we here attempt to model the wind source more realistically than in previous work, we shall still focus on the hydrodynamical aspects of the flow and thus we do not include heating or cooling <ref> (see, e.g., Melia 1994) </ref>. Nor do we include any relativistic effects. Instead, we assume the medium to be an unmagnetized, polytropic gas with pressure P = (fl 1)e where , and e are the mass and internal energy densities, respectively, and fl = 4=3 is the adiabatic index. <p> The calculations are carried out within a cubical domain of solution with 112 3 active zones geometrically scaled so that the central zones are 1/32 times the size of the outermost zones, closely mimicking the "multiply nested grids" arrangement used by other researchers <ref> (e.g., Ruffert & Melia 1994) </ref>. This allows - 6 - for maximal resolution of the accretor within the computer memory limits available while sufficiently resolving the wind sources and minimizing zone-to-zone boundary effects. <p> determined in the present simulations is an order of magnitude too small to support the fossil disk scenario (since then the energy liberated as the wind impacts the fossil disk should be visible; Falcke & Melia 1997), it is still large enough that any standard ff-disk would be easily detectable <ref> (Melia 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recent observations <ref> (Najarro, et al. 1994) </ref> suggest that the IRS 16 wind is somewhat colder than the temperature assumed here, with a Mach number of ~ 30, and that it may originate from more than 15 sources of varying strength rather than 10 sources of equal strength.

Reference-contexts: Some earlier work (e.g., Petrich, et al. 1989) found that varying fl affects the flow pattern significantly, particularly at radii much smaller than R A , while others <ref> (e.g., Ruffert 1996) </ref> found that it does not, particularly at the larger radii considered here.

Reference-contexts: As we shall see below, the accretion rate depends not only on the distance of the mass-losing star cluster from the accretor but also on the relative spatial distribution of the sources. As suggested by related work involving linear gradients <ref> (Ruffert & Anzer 1995) </ref>, the average value of is also larger than that of the uniform case, exhibiting large temporal fluctuations, but still not as large as one might expect.
