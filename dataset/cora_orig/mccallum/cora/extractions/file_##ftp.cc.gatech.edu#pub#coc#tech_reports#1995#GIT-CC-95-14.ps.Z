Abstract: Past and current campus data networks generally utilize connection-less network layer protocols like IP. Future networks are expected to use ATM which provides a connection-oriented service. New ATM switches are coming to market with baseline parameters such as the number of concurrent SVC's supported and the number of call setups possible per second. These parameters will determine the usefulness of this equipment in large campus networks for current applications and topologies. We present an analysis of the effect of these parameters on the ability of a circuit-based network to support the networking requirements of a college campus. We performed this analysis using IP traffic logs from three distinct networks within our campus. We consider four different ATM deployment scenarios and two circuit replacement algorithms. From our analysis we derive expected requirements for SVC setup rates and hold times necessary to support the measured traffic.

Reference-contexts: According to our analysis these parameters should be sufficient for our current network requirements. On the Fore ASX 100 switch, SVCs are removed at the same time the ARP entry is removed for a destination. This occurs after 15 minutes of idle time <ref> [1] </ref>. We have observed that a hold time of just 90 seconds would probably be sufficient for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: The third subnet we analyzed is a departmental subnet with approximately 250 hosts. These include office workstations and file-servers. We collected network traffic information from these three subnets using the NNStat <ref> [2] </ref> program running on a Sparcstation 1+ from Sun Microsystems. The traffic was monitored during the months of November and December, 1994.

Reference-contexts: On the backbone there is a large percentage of Other traffic, even more than for UDP. On the backbone, this traffic is mostly due to the use of tunneled IP multicast traffic 9 between MBONE routers <ref> [3] </ref>. While this is significant traffic, it is primarily between only three hosts and requires only two VC's. On the other hand, the rather small ICMP packet counts account for a fairly large number of VC's.

Reference-contexts: Special steps must be taken to ensure that ATM switches are designed to meet the requirements of the traditional data networking community. Two popular approaches to deploying ATM in the data network environment are Local Area Network (LAN) emulation and Internet Protocol (IP) over ATM <ref> [4] </ref>. In LAN emulation, the ATM switch provides a Media Access Control (MAC) level emulation of the services in an IEEE 802 LAN [6]. This involves the use of a MAC sub-layer that builds a best-effort, datagram service on top of the the connection oriented ATM service.

Reference-contexts: The IP over ATM approach is a mechanism for transmitting IP traffic directly over ATM switches without the emulation of a MAC layer <ref> [5] </ref>. In this approach, an ATM virtual circuit is used to directly connect two IP members of a logical subnetwork. Communication to hosts outside of the logical subnetwork requires the use of an intermediate IP router.

Reference-contexts: Previous research in the determination of virtual circuit requirements for data networking has not considered these different configuration options. Saran and Keshav performed a cost-based analysis of circuit holding time policies for IP traffic in ATM networks and found that Least Recently Used (LRU) performs well <ref> [7] </ref>. They present evidence that LRU can be effective in the presence of either a paging cost model (no hold time cost) or a holding cost model. Schmidt and Campbell analyzed TCP and UDP traffic separately over LAN and WAN segments to determine connection setup rates [8].

Schmidt and Campbell analyzed TCP and UDP traffic separately over LAN and WAN segments to determine connection setup rates <ref> [8] </ref>. Both of these previous studies have focused on measuring host-to-host connections in the network and do not consider the different deployment scenarios we evaluated. In this paper we have identified several requirements for ATM switches that will be deployed in current LAN environments.
