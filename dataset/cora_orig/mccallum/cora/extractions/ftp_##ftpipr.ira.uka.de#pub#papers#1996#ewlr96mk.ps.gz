Abstract: flflfl British Aerospace PLC, Sowerby Research Centre, UK. Abstract. Within this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the skillfulness of robot behaviour and the progress made by robots when learning new and adapting existing skills. The principle measure that we use is the amount of instruction (e.g., by means of examples) that the robot needs to execute some task with a certain level of performance. Since we require only a simple indication of performance and a mean to check syntactic equivalence, this measure is independent on the level of abstraction, the kind of tasks, and the learning technique in use.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, even in impressing applications such as sheep shearing (Trevelyan, 1992), meat cutting (Mirinz, 1993), playing snooker or ping-pong (Schwietzer, 1989), the handling of flexible material using multi arm robots <ref> (Buckingham, 1992) </ref>, and the shaping of dough (Shacklock, 1994), there are no skilled robots. Today, only few real robots exist that learn such strategies (Nuttin and Brussel, 1995; Reignier et al., 1995; Pomerleau, 1991; Kaiser et al., 1995a), i.e., that acquire skills.

Reference-contexts: In Cognitive Science, a step of compilation or proceduralization is postulated that makes this knowledge operational (Fitts, 1964; Anderson, 1982). These approaches are related to automatic programming techniques <ref> (Dufay and Latombe, 1984) </ref>. While bottom-up skill learning is basically an inductive process, the top-down approach has a strong deductive component. A learning step is required to find an operational description of the already available knowledge.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Along with "intelligence" and "expert behaviour," the term skill has become accepted for describing abilities that are comparable to those of humans. Various definitions of skill exist like those of Suss-man (Sussman, 1975), Hollnagel (Hollnagel, 1992), Gregory <ref> (Gregory, 1987) </ref>, and ourselves (Khodaban-dehloo, 1993; Kaiser et al., 1995b; Kaiser and Dill-mann, 1996). Most often, skill is associated to a physical activity of a system that has some influence on the system's environment. In English language, however, "skill" denotes the learned power of doing a thing competently.

Reference-contexts: The two basic criteria that must be met are the following <ref> (Kaiser and Dillmann, 1996) </ref>: 1. The representation must allow for incremen tal learning. 2. The representation must be operational w.r.t. the target system. Choosing a suitable representation is a task that's done automatically in human skill acquisition. <p> Consider the case of an elementary skill such as the peg-into-hole insertion (Fig. 3). Such a skill can be built from human demonstrations <ref> (Kaiser and Dillmann, 1996) </ref>, and, for example, represented by a radial-basis function network. example of an elementary skill. From the demonstration, samples (x (t); u (t)) with x (t) being a vector of force/torque measurements and u (t) being a vector of translational/rotational offsets occur.

Reference-contexts: Especially in the light of the difficulty to evaluate the usefulness of learning modules that are integrated in complex systems such as robots <ref> (Kaiser et al., 1995a) </ref>, the work presented in this paper therefore marks an important step towards comparability of results. Our current work is concerned with applying the proposed measure to analyze the development of robot skills in applications including force-controlled manipulation and navigation tasks.
