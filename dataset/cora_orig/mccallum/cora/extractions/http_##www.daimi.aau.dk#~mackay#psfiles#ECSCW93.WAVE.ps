Abstract: This paper describes an experiment to test the media space concepts developed at Rank Xerox EuroPARC in a real world setting, that is a distributed product development organization within a large multinational corporation. We installed two types of media space connections: a focused dial up video-phone for engineering problem solving between designers in England and the shop floor of a factory in the Netherlands; an unfocused office share to support administrative tasks. The results of user observation are that the video links did prove to be effective for problem solving on the shop floor, enhancing cooperation, mutual trust and confidence, and for supporting new forms of communication in the virtual shared office. We observed that users integrated very quickly the new video links into their existing media space made up of telephone, beepers, satellite video conference, fax, email, answering machines, etc. Users learnt very easily how to shift from one medium to another. This suggests that real world media spaces should be designed to allow a user - driven smooth transition from one medium to another according to the task at hand and the bandwidth available: from live video to stored video; from moving video to still frames; from multimedia spaces to shared computing spaces for synchronous sketching and asynchronous message posting; from two user conversation to multi-user conference call.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The RAVE project at Rank Xerox EuroPARC has been exploring ways to support cooperative work using a media space infrastructure offering ubiquitous video and audio interconnectivity within a building <ref> (Buxton and Moran, 1990) </ref>. RAVE did not focus on replacing faceto-face communication, but rather it explored ways to support work and social relations throughout their spectrum, from informal casual encounters to focused, formal and planned cooperative tasks (Gaver et al., 1992).

Reference-contexts: RAVE did not focus on replacing faceto-face communication, but rather it explored ways to support work and social relations throughout their spectrum, from informal casual encounters to focused, formal and planned cooperative tasks <ref> (Gaver et al., 1992) </ref>. <p> To support the cooperation between the two planner analysts we installed an office share link, that is a continuous video connection active throughout the day <ref> (Gaver et al. , 1992) </ref>. The idea of an office share is that a constant video connection in a small screen or window provides an unobtrusive medium to feel the presence of the remote person without demanding a focused social engagement.

Reference-contexts: The results of the office share experiment seem to be very elusive. We need a model of communication to capture and evaluate the meaning and weight of nice-to-have. An office share can be seen as a medium which specifically supports the phatic function of communication <ref> (Jakobson, 1960) </ref>. The phatic function is to keep the communication open, to maintain the social relationship between the two partners, to reinforce the physical (or virtually page 11 physical) and psychological connections that must exist to allow cooperation and mutual trust.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the system should be improved with an asynchronous multimedia annotation tool for editing stored video; this can be done with a general purpose tool to edit time-based media called EVA, under development at Rank Xerox EuroPARC <ref> (Mackay, 1989) </ref>. page 13 Shared virtual pin-board. The users of the office share link often put up notices or pictures in front of the camera.

Reference-contexts: It was clear that we were using vfctool for something it had not been designed for, however it allowed us to get started. In order to achieve higher refresh rates we installed IVS, a software package to support video and audio conferences over the Internet <ref> (Turletti, 1993) </ref>. IVS grabs video frames from a Videopix board and compresses them in software on the workstation according to the H.261 standard. IVS transmits the compressed data stream over an IP network using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and takes about 20 to 30 kbps of bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Another way to look at an office share is as a medium to support the communication that takes place by behaving. As the Palo Alto School pointed out, our entire behaviour constitutes a message and since one cannot not behave, one cannot not communicate <ref> (Watzlawick et al., 1967) </ref>.
