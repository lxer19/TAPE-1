Abstract: Classifying accounts is a critical part of efficiently servicing credit cards. A problem we call the Rule Coverage Problem (RCP) arrises when using rules for specifying a classification strategy, and we develop and compare three approaches for solving this problem.

Reference-contexts: An effective collection strategy maximizes payments less expenses over the long term while maximizing customer good will. A collection strategy is created either by intuition and experience or more recently by optimization programs such as PAYMENT <ref> [Makuch90] </ref>. Marketing active accounts consists of creating and implementing a marketing strategy that augment billing statements with promotional messages and inserts.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this aw we can represent the sum in a canonical form such as all prime implicants, which can be computed by the consensus procedure of Quine <ref> [Schneeweiss89] </ref>. Another aw of this summing procedure is that we restricted it to boolean variables. We overcome this aw by extending Quines consensus procedure for use with multi-variables. 3.2 Multi-variable consensus procedure The consensus procedure of Quine can be extended for use with multi-variables to form a multi-variable consensus procedure.

Reference-contexts: 10 then class BB x 40= y 4= if x &lt; 500 then class AA if x &lt; 400 then class BB if 1 = 1 then goto label AA x = 400 AA: continue 3 instances of RCP to instances of Co-SAT, which can be solved by many methods <ref> [Hooker88] </ref>. We solved them using two methods: integer programming and resolution. Since RCP is Co-NP-complete and some practical classification strategies have over 1000 rules, for our third approach we define a class of subproblems of RCP and develop efficient algorithms for some of them.

Reference-contexts: An intelligent rule editor should point out each rule covered and the rules covering it. Informally, the Rule Coverage Problem (RCP) is determining if any rules are covered by higher-priority rules. It can be shown that RCP is Co-NP-complete (see <ref> [Garey79] </ref> for an introduction to NP-complete problems). 1.2 Solving RCP We look for potential algorithms for solving RCP by reducing RCP to a better known problems and examining the algorithms developed for them.
