Abstract: An examination of the images contained in the SRI JISCT stereo database revealed that the constant image brightness assumption is indeed often false. Moreover, the simple additive/multiplicative models of the form I L = fiI R + ff do not adequately represent the observed deviations. A comprehensive physical model of the observed deviations is difficult to develop. However, many potential sources of deviations can be represented by a nonlinear monotonically increasing relationship between intensities. Under these conditions, we believe that an expansion/contraction matching of the intensity histograms represents the best method to both measure the degree of validity of the CIB assumption and correct for it. Dynamic histogram warping (DHW) is closely related to histogram specification. However, it is shown that histogram specification introduces artifacts that do not occur with dynamic histogram warping. Experimental results show that image histograms are closely matched after DHW, especially when both histograms are modified simultaneously. DHW is also capable of removing simple constant additive and multiplicative biases without derivative operations, thereby avoiding amplification of high frequency noise. It is demonstrated that DHW can improve the estimates from stereo and optical flow estimators.

Reference-contexts: The left and right histograms are respectively grey and black. The corrected histograms are almost identical (error of 24). The utility of this is clearly demonstrated by applying a stereo algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> that assumes CIB to the image pair (1) with no correction, (2) with correction by histogram specification and (3) correction by DHW. The corresponding disparity maps are shown in Figures (6). Very poor disparity estimates are obtained with no correction. Histogram specification provides substantial improvement but significant errors remain.

Reference-contexts: Image histogram matching is typically performed by the process of histogram specification <ref> [3] </ref>. However, while histogram specification produces good matches, the local comparison of histograms introduces artifacts (spikes in the matched histograms) because matching errors propagate and accumulate and must periodically be corrected.

DYNAMIC HISTOGRAM WARPING Dynamic histogram warping is strongly related to work in sequence comparison and especially to dynamic time warping <ref> [5] </ref>. For dynamic histogram warping, two intensity histograms are compressed and/or expanded to best match one another. Histogram samples can be matched one-to-one, one-to-many (expansion) or many-to-one (contraction), as illustrated in Figure (2a). However, the many-to-many mappings of Figure (2b) are considered illegal.
