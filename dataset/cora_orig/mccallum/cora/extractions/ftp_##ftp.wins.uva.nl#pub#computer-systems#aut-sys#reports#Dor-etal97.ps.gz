Abstract: An ADS (Automatic Debiting System) is a toll-collecting system on a freeway, which interacts with a transponder in each car, and subtracts a fee from a credit card. Non-payers are to be photographed and fined. In requirements on such systems in The Netherlands, privacy laws demand separation between the financial transaction and the registration; the system should not be usable for tracking citizens. There are also very strict demands on performance, with error rates of the order of 10 5 to minimize the number of incorrect enforcements. Both demands combined require complex ADS systems. This paper describes a simulation of the proposed ADS's of bidders, to be used for their quantitative evaluation. It is highly important to chose the proper level for the abstraction of the simulated system, both to keep the simulation within reasonable cost and time, and also to establish that the simulated system indeeds represents the actual proposal. In this paper, we show how a consistent application of the concept of virtual sensors can be applied to clarify the choice of the proper level of abstraction for the ADS proposals, and its implementation. It leads to a simulation that is faster, but no less specific in its quantitative results than a full implementation of the ADS.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation of the systems is to be done on a time-scale permitting the Dutch government to plan the introduction, which in some cases is before the first prototype can have been built. (Similar systems have been built and tested <ref> [1] </ref>; however, the present system requirements are sufficiently different that new designs have been made.) There are so many scenarios, the system's internal structure is so complicated, and the demands so severe, that an evaluation in an actual test setup is not practicable, even if prototypes were available.

Reference-contexts: The ultimate goal is to use these systems to influence road usage. There are very strict demands on performance, with error rates of the order of 10 5 to minimize the number of incorrect decisions, since those would make the systems socially unacceptable. Specifications have been sent out <ref> [2] </ref>, and several consortia are bidding with systems of various designs. The proposals of users bidding for the placement of such systems have to be evaluated before they are considered, in their performance under the (unfortunately) rich set of Dutch weather conditions, traffic flows, and vehicle types.

Reference-contexts: One expects errors in sensor interpretation, in the capability of the sensors to separate the different vehicles under various traffic and weather conditions, and in keeping track of the correspondence between these various aspects. 1.2 The simulator ADS-SIM A sketch of the components of our simulator ADS-SIM <ref> [4] </ref>, based on the components of the actual systems is given in Figure 1. This figure shows that ADS-SIM provides a framework mostly containing a traffic simulator and statistical data processing; and that into this framework modules are to be defined which model the actual ADS.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show how the concept of virtual sensors, designed for goal-directed sensing in (robotic) autonomous systems [3] is used in the simulation design. We also show how this forces the choice for a discrete event simulation <ref> [6] </ref>, which in turn affects the implementation of the virtual sensor concept. 1.1 A typical ADS A typical ADS system satisfying the specifications of the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works & Water Management consists the following functional components: * communication with OBU, and localization of OBU: The vehicle has an
