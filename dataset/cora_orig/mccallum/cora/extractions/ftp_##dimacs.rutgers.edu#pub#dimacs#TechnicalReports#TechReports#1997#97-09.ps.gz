Reference-contexts: This model was first considered by Runnels and Lebowitz <ref> [7] </ref> who proved that when the number of components M is larger than some minimum M 0 then the transition from the gas phase at small values of z to the demixed phase at large values of z does not take place directly. <p> A natural question now arises, just how big does M 0 have to be to see this ordered phase for M M 0 . It was shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that on the square lattice M 0 &lt; 27 6 ; a ridiculously large upper bound.

Reference-contexts: It was shown in [7] that on the square lattice M 0 &lt; 27 6 ; a ridiculously large upper bound. On the other hand a direct computation on the Bethe lattice <ref> [8, 9] </ref> with q-neighbors gives M 0 = [q=(q 2)] 2 , which would suggest M 0 ~ 4 for the square lattice, M 0 ~ 3 for the cubic and M 0 ~ 2 for the bcc lattice. <p> Now it can be shown, using FKG inequalities, that M 0 3 on any bipartite lattice [10], but beyond that we have no simple or convincing argument for finding M 0 . We therefore turned to Monte Carlo simulations. This gave on the square lattice M 0 = 7 <ref> [8, 9] </ref> which is only about twice as large as the Bethe lattice prediction. This wetted our appetite to try the bcc lattice where q = 8. To our surprise we find here, using Monte Carlo simulations, that M 0 does indeed equal 3, on the bcc lattice. <p> Near z c we expect U L 0 U L for L 0 6= L. This method for locating the transition fugacities was used in our previous studies <ref> [8, 9] </ref> on the square lattice as well.

While we have no clue of how to find rigorously the actual value of M 0 or of z c (M ), it was argued in <ref> [9] </ref> that for a given z and M large enough, the typical occupancy pattern on the lattice (ignoring the label I of the particles) should be like that of a one component lattice gas with nearest neighbor hard core exclusion. <p> This provides solid evidence for the existence of a reentry phase transition in the temperature- magnetic field plane phase diagram of an Ising spin system with nearest-neighbor anti-ferromagnetic interactions on the bcc lattice [13] . We also find, as in <ref> [9] </ref>, that for large M, z d (M ) for the crystal-demixed transition can be computed via Pirogov-Sinai theory [14] yielding, M = z d + 2 2=3z 2 which matches up smoothly with our MC results, see Fig. 3. <p> We next present results of our simulations and refer the reader to <ref> [9] </ref> for a more detailed description of the model and additional references. 2 Results Our MC simulations were carried out on a bcc lattice of size 2 fi S 3 = 2 fi 22 3 with periodic boundary conditions. <p> Near z c we expect U L 0 U L for L 0 6= L. This method for locating the transition fugacities was used in our previous studies <ref> [8, 9] </ref> on the square lattice as well. <p> In cases of a larger hysteresis region we located the transition fugacity z d by finding the relative stability of one of the two phases during a simulation starting from configurations with both phases present in parallel slices extending over the length of the simulation box, as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The resulting phase transition values of z d are shown in Fig. 1. We note that with increasing number of components, the transition fugacities approach the exact asymptotic line M = z + 2 2=3z 2 + .
