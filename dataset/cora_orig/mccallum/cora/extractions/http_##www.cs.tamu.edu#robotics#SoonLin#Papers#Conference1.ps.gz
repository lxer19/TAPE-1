Abstract: A dynamic model of a dexterous manipulation system can be used for predicting the feasibility of a manipulation plan generated under the quasistatic assumption but executed under dynamic conditions. Contact forces between the object and manipulator are calculated to determine whether contacts can be maintained for the planned motion. Compressive contact forces indicate that contacts can be maintained for the specified manipulation plan and this implies that actual dynamic manipulation succeeds. Results of the solution of dynamic equations are given for selected objects and video images of successful plans are shown.

Reference-contexts: Dexterous manipulation differs from other types of robotic manipulation in that the object being grasped can also be repositioned and reoriented within the end-effector while the end-effector itself is undergoing translation and rotation. Most research has focused on the kinematics and dynamics of fingertip-only dexterous manipulation <ref> [2, 5, 12, 1] </ref>. As for whole-arm manipulation (which aims to use all surfaces of the hand ) the quasistatic assumption has often been applied. Early work by Trin-kle [7, 9] described lifting a polygon using an enveloping grasp with sliding contacts.

Reference-contexts: This is done by solving a set of simultaneous nonlinear equations, each of which is a C-function equated to zero. C-functions, which are widely used in robot motion planning <ref> [4] </ref>, describe the position and orientation of a robot rel ative to an object or obstacle. A similar reasoning applies to P A II .

Reference-contexts: More specifically, they consist of sliding the object to the left and then trying to flip it rightwards over a vertex that is touching the palm. The sequence of finger and object motions for the irregular heptagon is the same as the quasistatic plan described in <ref> [10] </ref>. This is shown in Fig. 2. We are especially interested in showing that this plan works also in a dynamic environment given the torque trajectories that we applied. <p> The type of object motion encountered during manipulation consists only of sliding. To achieve sliding motion to the left, an anti-clockwise torque is applied to finger 1 (right finger). From <ref> [10] </ref>, we have a good idea of the amount of torque required to bring about this motion. If applying this torque does not make the object slide to the left, the torque is increased by 10%. This process is continued until the object begins to slide. <p> Using the above guidelines, we were able to obtain torque trajectories for joints 1 and 2 ( Fig. 6 ) to manipulate the irregular heptagon with compressive contact forces. The results from dynamic simulation thus show that a quasistatic plan <ref> [10] </ref> corresponding to Fig. 2 can also work in a dynamic environment. With only slight modifications to the quasistatic torque trajectories for the irregular heptagon, we were able to obtain torque trajectories for the hexagon. This gives rise to the plan shown in Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: W n and W t are the normal and tangential wrench matrices respectively defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> When the contacts are all sliding, the tangential wrench intensity can be expressed in terms of the normal wrench intensity as: c t = Uffic n ; (3) where ffi and U are as defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. U is a matrix whose diagonal elements are the coefficients of friction between the object and the manipulator and all off-diagonal elements are zero. ffi is also a diagonal matrix; the diagonal elements are either +1 or 1 and indicate the direction of sliding. <p> Let us consider the case of 4 sliding contacts. In this case, W n is a 3x4 matrix. The Jacobian matrix, J n , is 4x2 corresponding to 4 contacts and 2 joints. Both of these quantities are defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. When the Jacobian matrix is partitioned into 2 columns, we can write J n as: J n = j 1n j 2n : (5) 2.1 Velocities and accelerations derived from the kinematic constraint For velocities, we specify _ 1 and solve for . <p> To do this, we partition the matrix fi T fl into h W n j 2n fi j 1n : Following the notation in <ref> [11] </ref>, let us make the follow ing definitions: P A I = W n j 2n and P A II = j 1n ; (6) where P A I is nonsingular. <p> The number of contact constraints will then be 2R+S where R is the number of rolling contacts and S is the number of sliding contacts. This also determines the dimension of the P A I matrix. Detailed consideration of this analysis can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. 2.2 Derivation of the differential equation of motion At this time, recall equation (2) and the dynamic equation for finger 2 as given by equation (1) which we shall rewrite as follows: M q g obj W n c n W t c t = 0 ; (10) J 2
