Abstract: We consider the problem of realizing several common communication structures in the all-optical Partitioned Optical Passive Stars (POPS) topology. We show that, often, the obvious or "natural" method of implementing a communication pattern in the POPS does not efficiently utilize the communication capabilities of the POPS. We present techniques which distribute the communication load uniformly in the POPS for four of the most common communication patterns (all-to-all personalized, global reduction operations, ring, and torus). We prove that these techniques provide optimal performance in the sense that they minimize the time required to deliver the messages from each node to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: Theoretically, WDM has remarkable potential, yet substantial progress is needed to achieve acceptable tuning speeds (nanoseconds) over necessary ranges (hundreds of nanometers). More progress is also needed on solutions to power budget problems in large WDM systems. The Partitioned Optical Passive Stars (POPS) topology <ref> [1, 5] </ref> is a topological approach to providing multiple physical data channels. It is an interconnection architecture that uses multiple non-hierarchical stars to implement single-hop networks [2, 3].

Reference-contexts: New all-optical networking designs are needed that present multiple data channels which are physically concurrent [6]. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is one method for achieving these concurrent multiple channels. A large amount of research has been accomplished on WDM-based systems <ref> [4, 13] </ref>. The majority of this has been to develop multiple-access multiple-channel protocols on star architectures using tunable transmitters and receivers [7]. Theoretically, WDM has remarkable potential, yet substantial progress is needed to achieve acceptable tuning speeds (nanoseconds) over necessary ranges (hundreds of nanometers).

The Partitioned Optical Passive Stars (POPS) topology <ref> [1, 5] </ref> is a topological approach to providing multiple physical data channels. It is an interconnection architecture that uses multiple non-hierarchical stars to implement single-hop networks [2, 3]. <p> The number of such channels is not absolutely limited, and is a key engineering tradeoff. This design flexibility provides for a customized optimization between lower total system complexity versus the combination of higher system throughput, lower power budgets, and lower network control overheads. An analysis in <ref> [5] </ref> confirms that, independent of the 1 number of channels configured, POPS network data channels can be efficiently utilized for random permutation-based communication patterns. Beyond random communication patterns, multi-processor applications frequently exhibit regular communication patterns. Topologies that are appropriate for interconnection networks must efficiently accommodate these communication structures. <p> In this case, s represents the minimum degree of multiplexing which allows all the connections in M to be established in the POPS. Finally, if WDM is to be used, then s would be the minimum number of wavelengths needed to simultaneously establish the connections in M . In <ref> [5] </ref>, POPS networks delivering random message sets that are permutations or subsets of permutations were shown to be highly efficient. The following sections of this paper examine some regular communication structures. <p> p d = 2bn, b &gt; 1 log n + 2 (b 1) log b Natural Unidirectional Ring d 1 Natural Bidirectional Ring 2d 2 Optimal Unidirectional Ring d 2 =n Optimal Bidirectional Ring 2d 2 =n Optimal Unidirectional Torus d 2 p Optimal Bidirectional Torus d 2 p In <ref> [5] </ref>, it has been shown that an n-node POPS handles random communication patterns efficiently, especially when the coupler degree, d, is proportional to p n. Hence, choosing d = 2 n for POPS efficiently supports random traffic, and optimally supports the regular communication patterns discussed in this paper.
