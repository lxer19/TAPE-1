Abstract: Chapman's paper, ``Planning for Conjunctive Goals,'' has been widely acknowledged for its contribution toward understanding the nature of nonlinear (partial-order) planning, and it has been one of the bases of later work by others---but it is not free of problems. This paper addresses some problems involving modal truth and the Modal Truth Criterion (MTC). Our results are as follows:

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Chapman's paper, ``Planning for Conjunctive Goals,'' <ref> [2] </ref> has been widely acknowledged as an important step towards formalizing partial-order planning, and it has been one of the bases of later work by others (for example, [5, 7, 9, 12, 14]). <p> Section 4 presents results about 1 Although Chapman does not explicitly state that his usage is consistent with modal logics, it seems clear to us that this is what he had in mind. In particular, Chapman explicitly appeals to modal duality in his proof of the MTC <ref> [2, p. 368] </ref>. 2 If modal duality held, then both necessary truth and possible would be at similar levels of complexity: either both would be polynomial, or one would be NP-hard and the other co-NP-hard. <p> We defined truth and conditional truth only for complete plans, because for incomplete plans, what is true or conditionally true will vary depending on which completion we choose. In incomplete plans, we instead need to talk about modal truth, which Chapman defines as follows <ref> [2, p. 336] </ref>: I will say ``necessarily p'' if p is true of all completions of an incomplete plan, and ``possibly p'' if p is true of some completion. <p> Above, Chapman apparently means p to be nearly any statement about a plan: examples in his paper include not only statements about specific literals and situations in the plan, but also statements about the entire plan (e.g., the statement <ref> [2, p. 341] </ref> that a plan ``necessarily solves the problem''). However, unless we place some restrictions on the nature of p, this has some dubious results---for example, if P is an incomplete plan, then all completions of P are complete, and therefore P itself is necessarily complete. <p> In Section 5.2, we discuss some planning situations where this occurs. 5 Comparison with Other Work 5.1 The Modal Truth Criterion Chapman states the MTC as follows <ref> [2, p. 340] </ref>: logic, which has been used to provide semantics for programs and plans, provides a clean way to separate executability/termination conditions from goal satisfaction conditions. <p> If we take these words literally, then the definition of modal truth tells us that the plan must be modally executable. This is consistent with Chapman's definition of a situation <ref> [2] </ref>, from which it follows that a step's output situation (and hence what is true in that situation) is only defined if the step can be executed. <p> look at Chapman's proof of necessity and sufficiency of his MTC reveals that his proof deals with necessary conditional truth rather than necessary truth. 8 In proving that any literal with an establisher and no clobberer must be necessarily true, Chapman's proof refers to white-knight steps for every potential clobberer, <ref> [2, p. 370] </ref>, without checking that the white knights are in fact executable. 9 For the ``necessary truth'' version of the MTC, this does not affect the validity of Chapman's proof, since executability occurs naturally as a consequence of applying necessary conditional truth recursively to prerequisites of all preceding steps. <p> This alternative interpretation is not as far-fetched as it might sound. To see this, note that Chapman defines the notion of truth of a literal in a situation as follows <ref> [2, p. 338] </ref>: A [literal] is true in a situation if it codesignates with a [literal] that is a member of the situation. <p> Here, there is no explicit requirement that the step be exe-cutable. This suggests that the MTC does not require that P be modally executable, and thus suggests that Chapman was talking about modal conditional truth. This interpretation is also consistent with his ``nondeterministic achievement procedure'' <ref> [2, Fig. 7] </ref>, where to make a literal necessarily true in a situation, he only ensures establishment and declobbering without explicitly stating that the establisher needs to be executable. (As explained above, for the case of necessary truth, executability follows from making every prerequisite of every action necessarily conditionally true.) The <p> In Dean and Boddy's formulation, a partially ordered set of events A is projectible even when a rule's preconditions don't hold (in which case the rule simply has no effect). Hence in their formalism, determining possible truth and necessary truth are duals, and both are NP-hard. Chapman <ref> [2, p. 371] </ref> uses universally executable actions (he calls them conditional steps) in proving his intractability theorem for actions containing conditional effects. A plan composed entirely of such steps will always be executable, leading to the same results as in Dean and Boddy's formalism. <p> In this case, as the following theorem shows, checking necessary truth will be co-NP-hard, even with unconditional steps. Theorem 4 If the language L contains only finitely many constant symbols, then necessary truth is co-NP-hard. Notice that this result is related to Chapman's observation <ref> [2, p. 356] </ref> that restricting the range of a variable to a finite set will defeat the MTC, and make constraint computations NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: Thus, unlike necessary conditional truth and possible conditional truth, necessary truth and possible truth do not obey the modal duality that is obeyed by all classical modal logics <ref> [3, p. 62] </ref>, and thus do not define a well-formed modal logic. It is easy to understand why this is so. The semantics of modal logics are based on Kripke structures (a.k.a. possible worlds). <p> As discussed below, this approach has been used in different forms by several different researchers. 10 While seemingly unintuitive, this relaxation is in fact very much consistent with the original formalization of actions in situational calculus <ref> [3] </ref>. In this formalism, actions are modeled as situation-transformers, with the transformation given by the Result function, which takes an action and a situation as the arguments. Having universally executable steps corresponds to having the Result be a total rather than a partial function.

Reference-contexts: Rosenchein restricts the use of conditionals in PDL to guarantee that the plan terminates irrespective of which branch of the conditional it takes. A very similar idea is used in Dean and Boddy's work on temporal projection <ref> [4] </ref>. In Dean and Boddy's formulation, a partially ordered set of events A is projectible even when a rule's preconditions don't hold (in which case the rule simply has no effect). Hence in their formalism, determining possible truth and necessary truth are duals, and both are NP-hard. <p> While our investigation is initially motivated by the apparent lack of modal duality in Chap-man's MTC, Nebel and Backstrom's work is motivated by the apparent asymmetry in the complexity of plan validation through modal truth criterion, and temporal projection (c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>). <p> Finally, while we concentrated on clarifying the nature of modal truth criterion, there have also been several misimpressions regarding its role in plan generation. In the extended version of this paper [8], we also address these confusions. 11 Checking possible truth has several applications in plan projection <ref> [4] </ref> as well as plan generalization [9].

Reference-contexts: Thus, necessary truth and possible truth have different levels of complexity. If modal duality held, then this would not be so, for each would be reducible to the other's complement via an equivalence of the form 3M (p; fin) :2:M (p; fin). Thus it would follow <ref> [6, p. 29] </ref> that either possible truth would be polynomial like necessary truth, or else necessary truth would be co-NP-hard.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 contains concluding remarks. Proofs of all the theorms stated in this paper can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 Basics The planning language L is any function-free first-order language. Since L is function-free, every term is either a variable symbol or a constant symbol, and thus every ground term is a constant symbol. <p> We hope readers will find this paper useful for that purpose.
