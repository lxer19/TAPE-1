Reference-contexts: The size of a composite object is larger than the sum of the sizes of its components. For example, (COUNT (CONS X Y)) = 1+(COUNT X)+(COUNT Y). A precise description of our theory is given by the combination of Chapter III of <ref> [1] </ref> and Section 3 of [2]. We now briefly discuss our notational conventions. 0 is an abbreviation of (ZERO); the positive decimal integer n is an abbreviation of the nest of n ADD1's around a 0.

Reference-contexts: Thus, 'ABC is an abbreviation of (PACK (CONS 65 (CONS 66 <ref> (CONS 67 0) </ref>))). 'NIL is further abbreviated NIL. (LIST x 1 x 2 ... x n ) is an abbreviation for (CONS x 1 (LIST x 2 ... x n )). (LIST) is an abbreviation of NIL. Finally, we provide a convention for abbreviating certain LISTP constants.
