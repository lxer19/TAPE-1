Abstract: Localization addresses the problem of determining the position of a mobile robot from sensor data. This paper presents an algorithm, called BaLL, which enables a mobile robot to learn a set of landmarks used in localizationand to learn how to recognize them using artificial neural networks. BaLL is based on a statistical localization approach. It is applicable to a large variety of sensors and environments. Experiments with a mobile robot equipped with sonar sensors and a camera illustrate that BaLL identifies highly useful landmarks.

Reference-contexts: After learning, our approach enables a robot to estimate is position from sensor data. 2.1 Markov Localization BaLL is based on Markov localization. Markov localization has recently been employed successfully in various state-of-the-art mobile robot systems (e.g., <ref> [3, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21] </ref>). localization is to compute a probability density over all positions, denoted by Bel (~). Bel (~) expresses the robot's subjective belief (uncertainty) that its current position is ~, where ~ denotes an arbitrary position.

Reference-contexts: The dashed line indicates the error when doors are used as landmarks, and the solid line corresponds to the error obtained when using BaLL. 3.3 Global Localization Results In global localization, the robot does not know initially where it is; thus, its initial uncertainty is uniformly distributed <ref> [6] </ref>. As the robot moves, the internal belief is refined based on sensor readings. In our environment, a single sensor snapshot is usually insufficient to determine the position of the robot uniquely. Thus, multiple sensor readings must be integrated over time.

Reference-contexts: In each experiment, approximately half the data was used for training, and the other half for testing. To collect the data efficiently, we repeatedly had our robot navigate in a 89 meter long segment of our building, using its built-in obstacle avoidance and wandering routines <ref> [8] </ref>. In each run, the robot was started at the same initial position and sent down the same corridor in the same direction. <p> We em ployed layered networks with six hidden units and a single output unit. In all experiments, the robot moved primarily along the center of the corridor. This is a result of the navigation routines employed <ref> [8, 23] </ref>, which keep the robot centered in the middle of the corridor unless a human blocks its path (which happened frequently). Using such a navigation system greatly reduced the number of examples required to estimate the density P (sj~). Locations were represented in three dimensions.

This paper presents an algorithm called BaLL (short for Bayesian Landmark Learning). BaLL enables a robot to learn its landmarks by itself, and to learn routines for their recognition (see also <ref> [9, 22] </ref>).

In our implementation, P (sj~) is represented by a piecewise constant function that is estimated from data <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> Put differently, by comparing the error E post for different landmarks, the robot can decide which one yields more accurate localization. The error E post cannot be computed directly. BaLL approximates E post using the data, as described in <ref> [22] </ref>. 2.3 Neural Network Training BaLL recognize landmarks with artificial neural networks, which map sensor scans (e.g., camera images, sonar scans) to values between 0 and 1. Thus, every feature of the environment which can be recognized by a neural network can potentially be a landmark. <p> BaLL trains these networks by minimizing the average a posterior error E post . The learning approach utilizes the fact that E post is differentiable in the weights of the neural networks (see <ref> [22] </ref> for an exact derivation of the derivatives of E post ). <p> After 30m of robot travel, the average error of the door-based approach is 7.46m. In comparison, BaLL attains the same accuracy after 4m, making it approximately 7.5 times as data-efficient. Further results, which include a description of the particular landmarks learned by BaLL, can be found in <ref> [22] </ref>. 4 Conclusion We have presented BaLL, a localization method that enables a mobile robot to find its own landmarks, and to learn artificial neural network for their recognition.
