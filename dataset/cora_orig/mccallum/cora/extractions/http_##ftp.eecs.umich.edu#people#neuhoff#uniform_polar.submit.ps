Reference-contexts: Conventional polar quantization (CPQ) uses a uniform scalar quantizer for the phase and an arbitrary scalar quantizer for the magnitude. Gallagher [3] and Pearlman [6] numerically optimized CPQ, by solving for the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. Bucklew and Gallagher <ref> [1] </ref> and Pearlman [7] analytically derived the asymptotically optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. It was shown that the difference between the phase and magnitude rates is asymptotically a constant and that the minimum mean squared error (MSE) of CPQ is less than that of scalar quantization. <p> This shows that both the magnitude and phase rates tend to infinity with R. Furthermore, the difference R fl fi R fl M tend to infinity so that the phase quantizer receives increasingly more rate as rate increases. Compare this with CPQ <ref> [1] </ref>, where the difference between phase and magnitude rates is a constant asymptotically. 5 Minimum MSE Evaluating the MSE expression (3) at the optimal rates R fl M and R fl fi yield the minimum MSE of uniform polar quantization, D fl (R) = c fi e 2 4R 2 [

Reference-contexts: Then the rates R fl M and R fl fi which minimize (3) subject to the constraint (4) are given by R fl log 2 e 4 R fl log 2 e + 4 where W () is the non-principal real-valued branch of the Lambert W function (c.f. <ref> [2] </ref>). Remarks: 1. The Lambert W function is the inverse function of y 7! y e y . For x real and e 1 x &lt; 0, W (x) takes on two possible real values. <p> By the non-principal real-valued branch of W, we refer to the branch satisfying W (x) 1. Under this assumption, W (x) ! 1 as x ! 0. In <ref> [2] </ref>, this branch is denoted by W 1 (), but we will drop the "1" here for convenience. 4 2. Note that both MSE and rate are normalized per dimension. <p> For this reason, we consider an asymptotic expression for W (x) when x &lt; 0 and x ! 0. It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that W (x) = O (ln (x) ln ( ln (x))) (5) as x ! 0.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In polar quantization, a vector (X 1 ; X 2 ) is quantized in terms of its magnitude and phase. Conventional polar quantization (CPQ) uses a uniform scalar quantizer for the phase and an arbitrary scalar quantizer for the magnitude. Gallagher <ref> [3] </ref> and Pearlman [6] numerically optimized CPQ, by solving for the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. Bucklew and Gallagher [1] and Pearlman [7] analytically derived the asymptotically optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. <p> In uniform polar quantization (UPQ), both the phase and magnitude are quantized using uniform scalar quantizers. UPQ was numerically optimized in <ref> [3] </ref> and [6], but has not been analytically optimized to date. In this paper, we present analytical results on the optimal rate allocation in UPQ and the resulting minimum MSE. Using recent results from Hui and Neuhoff [4], we derive the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers.

In this paper, we present analytical results on the optimal rate allocation in UPQ and the resulting minimum MSE. Using recent results from Hui and Neuhoff <ref> [4] </ref>, we derive the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. It is shown that the resulting minimum MSE of UPQ is greater than that of CPQ at high rates, but is significantly less than the MSE of uniform scalar quantization. <p> Now we use the results recently derived in <ref> [4] </ref> for the optimal support length of uniform scalar quantization.

Reference-contexts: The phase quantizer is uniformly distributed, so a uniform scalar quantizer is optimal. We assume that N fi is large enough so that the Panter-Dite formula <ref> [5] </ref> holds; that is, Z 2 ( b ) 2 p fi () d = 12N 2 Therefore if N M and N fi are large, and the support length of the magnitude quantizer is L fl M , then the MSE of UPQ as a function of N M and

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In polar quantization, a vector (X 1 ; X 2 ) is quantized in terms of its magnitude and phase. Conventional polar quantization (CPQ) uses a uniform scalar quantizer for the phase and an arbitrary scalar quantizer for the magnitude. Gallagher [3] and Pearlman <ref> [6] </ref> numerically optimized CPQ, by solving for the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. Bucklew and Gallagher [1] and Pearlman [7] analytically derived the asymptotically optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. <p> In uniform polar quantization (UPQ), both the phase and magnitude are quantized using uniform scalar quantizers. UPQ was numerically optimized in [3] and <ref> [6] </ref>, but has not been analytically optimized to date. In this paper, we present analytical results on the optimal rate allocation in UPQ and the resulting minimum MSE. Using recent results from Hui and Neuhoff [4], we derive the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. <p> On the other hand, comparing UPQ to USQ shows the effect of performing the transformation into polar co-ordinates. Clearly, there is a significant advantage to using this transformation. 6 Comparison to Empirical Results Here we compare our analytical results with the empirical results of Pearlman <ref> [6] </ref>, who numerically optimized UPQ for many different rates. Pearlman reported the optimal rate allocation, optimal step size, and minimum MSE for a number of UPQ rates up to rate 5. In this paper we consider only a few representative rates.
