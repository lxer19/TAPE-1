Abstract: We consider an asymptotically good tower (Y m ) m1 of curves over a finite field F q , where q is a square. The Weierstrass semigroup H m of a rational point P (m) 1 of Y m is determined. For n 2 H m and m = 1; 2 and 3 we will give rational functions on Y m that have pole order n at P (m)

Reference-contexts: The proof is by induction on m and by considering the whole pyramid of curves Y i;j . See <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Missing functions in a pyramid of curves The function j Y (x r1 j+1 in T m has a pole of order r m r mj + er mj1 at P (m) 1 and has no poles out side P (m) 1 , for all 0 e &lt; r. <p> Definition 3.5 Let e (0; j) = j. Let e (i; j) be the integer in the interval <ref> [1; r 1] </ref> that is congruent to 2i + j modulo r 1, if i &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 3.3 Let fi 2 . Then there exists exactly one point Q fifl on Y 3 above Q fi such that z x has a zero in Q fifl and v Q fifl (y fi) = r for all fl 2 (fi). We refer for the proof to <ref> [2] </ref>. A consequence of this proposition is that fQ fifl j fl 2 (fi)g is the set of points of Y 3 lying above Q fi .
