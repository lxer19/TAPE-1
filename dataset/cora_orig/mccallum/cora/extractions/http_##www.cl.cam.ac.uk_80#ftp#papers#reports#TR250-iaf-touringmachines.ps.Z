Abstract: It is becoming widely accepted that neither purely reactive nor purely deliberative control techniques are capable of producing the range of be-haviours required of intelligent robotic agents in dynamic, unpredictable, multi-agent worlds. We present a new architecture for controlling autonomous, mobile agents building on previous work addressing reactive and deliberative control methods. The proposed multi-layered control architecture allows a resource-bounded, goal-directed agent to react promptly to unexpected changes in its environment; at the same time it enables the agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing and projecting theories which hypothesise other agents' goals and intentions. The line of research adopted is very much a pragmatic one. A single, common architecture has been implemented which, being extensively parametrized, allows an experimenter to study functionally- and behaviourally-diverse agent configurations. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining an agent's behaviour under varying environmental conditions. To this end, we have constructed an experimental testbed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviours have been investigated. Some experience with the new control architecture is described. fl This paper expands on the author's article "TouringMachines: Autonomous Agents with Attitudes" which appears in IEEE Computer, 25(5), May, 1992. y Contact address as from September 1992: Bell-Northern Research Ltd.

Reference-contexts: Breaking with the traditionally held belief that "complex" architectures are required to produce intelligent agent behaviours, a number of non-deliberative (e.g. reactive [Fir87], situated <ref> [AC87, Mae90] </ref>, and behaviour-based [Bro86, Kae87]) architectures have recently been proposed. These architectures are characterised by a more direct coupling of perception to action, increased de-centralisation of control, and relative simplicity of design. <p> A surprisingly small number of previous architectures have addressed, and more importantly, investigated, 7 issues pertaining to coordination in multi-agent environments. Where these issues have been considered, the agents involved were either given relatively simple goals <ref> [AC87, SH88] </ref> or operated with little autonomy under the control of a supervisory agent [CGHH89].

Nevertheless, since the agent is very likely to encounter other entities unexpectedly, complete, detailed plans are undesirable if replanning is to be kept to a minimum.

Our approach to multi-agent coordination also differs from that of Durfee and Montgomery by placing more emphasis on the autonomous modelling capabilities required by complex agents, rather than on the mechanisms and protocols needed by agents to communicate and exchange information about their goals [DM90]. <p> This concords with most other simulated agent environments <ref> [CGHH89, DM90, PR90, SH88, VB90, Woo90] </ref>.
