Abstract: Mobile computers and wireless networks are emerging technologies which will soon make ubiquitous computing a reality. In the wireless environment, mobile clients may often be disconnected from stationary server machines or may have only a low-bandwidth channel for sending messages to servers. This environment raises new challenges for the support of database applications for three reasons: 1) the limited storage capacities of mobile machines, 2) the inability to accurately predict the future data needs of many data-intensive applications, and 3) the need to provide clients with new or updated data values in order to ensure consistent data access. One way (perhaps the only way) to address these challenges is to provide the stationary server machines with a relatively high-bandwidth channel over which to broadcast portions of the database. Wireless networks are but one compelling example of the more general class of asymmetric communication environments, which also includes CATV networks and information distribution services. We have proposed a mechanism called Broadcast Disks to provide database access in asymmetric communication environments. By appropriate organization of the broadcast program, an arbitrarily fine-grained memory hierarchy can be created. Such a hierarchy raises fundamental new issues for pre-fetching and client cache management. In this short paper we present a brief overview of asymmetric environments, our novel approach to organizing broadcast disks and some initial simulation results.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the technique is flexible, allowing the creation of any number of disks whose relative speeds can vary in any proportion. The details of this technique are beyond the scope of this short paper, but can be found in <ref> [AAF94] </ref>. Several other issues must be addressed in the design of the broadcast disk approach. Because unlike traditional client-server systems, data is disseminated rather than requested, data items in the broadcast must be self-identifying so that clients can determine which items are arriving on the broadcast. <p> We briefly discuss the dynamic aspects of broadcast organization in Section 5. 2.2 Example Performance Results We have performed a detailed simulation study of the properties multi-layered disks. Descriptions of these results for different client and server configurations are beyond the scope of this paper and are available in <ref> [AAF94] </ref>. Here, we present a single graph from that study in order to give a flavor of the tradeoffs involved in a broadcast environment. Due to space constraints, we provide only limited information about the simulation model. <p> A detailed analysis and description of these algorithms is presented in <ref> [AAF94] </ref>. Finally, it should be noted that the introduction of client caching also impacts the generation of broadcast programs at the server. The server must adapt its broadcast to account for the fact that a client caches a portion of its access range.

Reference-contexts: The need for cost-based caching and page replacement has been recognized in other domains in which there is a wide variation in the cost of obtaining data from different levels of the storage hierarchy. For example, tertiary mass storage [AnH93], magnetic disks <ref> [AkS92] </ref> and even in client-server storage systems [FCL92] have used cost-based replacement in some form or other. 7 Conclusions Many new applications have the property that the communication channel between the client and the server is asymmetrical.

Reference-contexts: This change may be of interest to other clients, including disconnected clients, if they have previously cached this value. The broadcast disk can be used as a medium for communicating the change in the form of a new value or an invalidation of the old value <ref> [BaI94] </ref>. Furthermore, the actual content of the broadcast disk might change. Suppose that we are broadcasting stock prices. A given stock price that is not in the BD may become interesting when it's price changes.

Reference-contexts: This broadcast disk controller will monitor the broadcast for interesting events.

Our work differs however, in that we have generalized the notion of "broadcast disks" to include an arbitrary number of "disks" of varying sizes and speeds, that can be superimposed on the broadcast medium. <p> The Datacycle project at Bellcore ([HGL87], <ref> [BGH92] </ref>) investigated using a very high bandwidth optical network as a repetitive broadcast medium for performing associative searches and continuous queries on the broadcast data. Datacycle broadcast data using a flat disk approach and so did not address the multi-level disk issues or the caching or prefetch issues.

Reference-contexts: However, this work did not investigate the notion of replicating the actual data to support non-uniform access patterns and did not investigate the impact of caching. Very recently, scheduling for satellite-based broadcast-based file systems has been proposed in <ref> [Chi94] </ref>. The need for cost-based caching and page replacement has been recognized in other domains in which there is a wide variation in the cost of obtaining data from different levels of the storage hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, the allocation of data items to the various disks would therefore involve tradeoffs analogous to those found in the construction of more traditional memory hierarchies, such as "The Five Minute Rule" <ref> [GrP87] </ref>. Thus, the items in highest demand (hot items) would be placed on the fastest spinning disks; the colder items would be placed on the bigger, slower disks.

Reference-contexts: One of the anticipated problems in a wireless environment is that of elective disconnection ([SKM93], <ref> [ImB94] </ref>). Mobile users may be disconnected from the server due to the large (monetary) cost or the unavailability of an uplink connection. In the absence of data broadcast, disconnected 1 users must rely solely on the data cached locally (pos-sibly including data stored on removable memory devices).
