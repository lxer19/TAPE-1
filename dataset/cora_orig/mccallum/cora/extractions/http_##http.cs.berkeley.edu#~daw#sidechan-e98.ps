Abstract: Building on the work of Kocher [Koc96], we introduce the notion of em side-channel cryptanalysis: cryptanalysis using implementation data. We discuss the notion of side-channel attacks and the vulnerabilities they introduce, demonstrate side-channel attacks against three product ciphers|timing attack against IDEA, processor-flag attack against RC5, and Hamming weight attack against DES|and then generalize our research to other cryptosystems.

Reference-contexts: And other product ciphers are vulnerable to similar attacks. We believe attacks based on cache hit ratio in large S-box ciphers like Blowfish [Sch94], CAST <ref> [Ada97] </ref>, and Khufu [Mer91] are possible. Stream ciphers with irregular clocking features can be especially vulnerable to side-channel attacks.

Reference-contexts: Our research attempts to show how little side channel information is required to break product ciphers. 1.1 Side Channels and Product Ciphers Symmetric encryption is most often done with product block ciphers, such as DES <ref> [DES81] </ref>, IDEA [LMM91], and Blowfish [Sch94]. To understand why side channels so often provide devastating attacks against product ciphers, it is necessary to digress a bit into the theory of block cipher design.

Reference-contexts: These attacks don't necessarily generalize|a fault-analysis attack just isn't possible against an implementation that doesn't permit an attacker to create the required faults|but can be much more powerful. Differential fault analysis of DES requires between 50 and 200 ciphertext blocks (no plaintext) to recover a key <ref> [BS97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Public-key algorithms are also vulnerable. Kocher showed how to mount at timing attack against several public-key algorithms [Koc96]. These results can be generalized to any primitive that uses multiplication modulo large numbers for 12 security, e.g. stream ciphers like Blum-Blum-Shub <ref> [BBS86] </ref> and hash functions like IBC Hash. The open questions lead in two different directions: how to obtain more detailed side-channel information, and how little side-channel information is required to break a cryptographic primitive. With regards to the former, we leave that to the electronic engineers.

Reference-contexts: Ciphers have not been designed with side channels in mind; hence, they are often very vulnerable to analysis using them. It is our belief that most operational cryptanalysis makes use of side-channel information. Sound as a side-channel|listening to the rotation of electromechanical rotor machines|was alluded to in Kahn <ref> [Kah67] </ref>. van Eck radiation| another side channel|has been demonstrated as a way to get plaintext [vEc85]. And Peter Wright discussed data leaking onto a transmission line as a side channel to break a French cryptographic device [Wri87].

Reference-contexts: In the last few years, new kinds of cryptanalytic attack have begun to appear in the literature: attacks that target specific implementation details. Both timing attacks <ref> [Koc96] </ref> and differential fault analysis [BDL97,BS97] make assumptions about the implementation, and use additional information garnered from attacking certain implementations. Failure analysis [HGS97,Bel96] assumes a one-bit feedback from the implementation|was the message successfully decrypted|in order to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. <p> Implementations of RC4 [Sch96] that have different side channel characteristics when i = j are also vulnerable. Public-key algorithms are also vulnerable. Kocher showed how to mount at timing attack against several public-key algorithms <ref> [Koc96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, the timing may be different depending on the number of bits rotated. This information can be used to recover the RC5 key <ref> [Koc98] </ref>.

Except for some special "weak-key" conditions, the full 8-round IDEA is apparently very strong against the standard differential, linear, and related- and chosen-key attacks.

Reference-contexts: Nearly all attacks on product ciphers work by learning some way to distinguish the output of all but the last rounds from a random permutation. In a linear attack <ref> [Mat93] </ref>, a subset of bits in the input to the cipher and to the last round don't quite have a balanced parity; in a differential attack [BS91,BS93], the relationship between a pair of inputs to the last round isn't quite random.
