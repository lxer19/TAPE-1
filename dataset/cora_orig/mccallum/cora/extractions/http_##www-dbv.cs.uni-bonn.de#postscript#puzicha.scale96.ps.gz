Title: Unsupervised Texture Segmentation on the Basis of Scale Space Features  
Author: Jan Puzicha, Thomas Hofmann and Joachim M. Buhmann 
Address: Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat Bonn, Germany  
Affiliation: Rheinische  
Abstract: A novel approach to unsupervised texture segmentation is presented, which is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem known as sparse pairwise data clustering. Pairwise dissimilarities between texture blocks are measured by scale space features, i.e., multi-resolution edges. These scale space features are computed by a Gabor filter bank tuned to spatial frequencies. To solve the data clustering problem a deterministic annealing technique is applied. This approach is examined from the viewpoint of scale space theory. Based on a meanfield approximation an efficient algorithm is derived. We present an application of the proposed algorithm to Brodatz like microtexture collages.

Reference-contexts: To minimize the cost function H, a global optimization technique discussed in the literature as meanfield annealing is derived. Meanfield annealing has already been successfully applied to pairwise data clustering problems with completely known dissimilarity matrices <ref> [2] </ref>. The basic idea of annealing methods is to treat the unknown boolean variables of the combinatorial optimization problem as random variables, to introduce a thermal noise parameter T , called the computational temperature, and to calculate the expectations, e.g., of assignments M i. <p> equiva lently, minimizes the generalized free energy F T (P ) = hHi P T S (P ) = M2M X P (M) log P (M): (9) The Gibbs distribution is maximally noncommittal with respect to missing information and maxi mally stable with respect to changes of the temperature T <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that for large T Eq. (9) is convex and that for T ! 0 the minimum converges to the uniform distribution on the set of states minimizing the original cost function.

Reference-contexts: Gabor filters are optimally localized in the sense that they reach the lower bound for simultaneous localization in spatial and Fourier domain <ref> [3] </ref>. By convolution with the Gabor kernels a 3-dimensional feature space is assigned to each image point, which can be used together with a vector valued diffusion for texture segmentation [12, Kap. 4.7], but this approach suffers from the computational complexity of the continuous Gabor transform.

Reference-contexts: Thus a band-pass structure for feature extraction seems to be appropriate. Although the Gaussian filter family completely characterizes the local image structure [12, Chap. 1], a natural access to explicit frequency-band information is tuning the filter to a particular spatial frequency <ref> [4] </ref>. As will be briefly shown, this procedure yields the Gabor-filter family [12, Chap. 2]. The good discrimination properties of Gabor features for textured images are well-known [1, 9, 10] and are in good agreement with psychophysical experiments [5]. <p> The tuning operation of a filter can be formalized <ref> [4] </ref> and yields the family of Gabor filters [12, Chap. 2] in the case of frequency tuning: B (x; ; k) = p e x t x=2 2 This is essentially a sine and a cosine function modulated by a Gaussian.

Reference-contexts: Texture dissimilarity is measured as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance of the empirical distributions for each of the Gabor features. This strategy for texture discrimination has been first proposed by Geman et al. <ref> [6] </ref> using features based on image intensities. We have significantly extended this approach by three major modifications. First the intensity based texture features used in [6] are replaced by a collection of scale space features as described. <p> This strategy for texture discrimination has been first proposed by Geman et al. <ref> [6] </ref> using features based on image intensities.

The approach of <ref> [6] </ref> was thereby significantly extended. A normalized cost function has been proposed motivated by theoretical and empirical evidence. Third, deterministic annealing optimization techniques were examined from the viewpoint of scale space theory.

The technical details of the presented deterministic annealing algorithm can be found in [8]. Results We performed a large number of experiments on a representative set of mixtures of Brodatz-like microtextures.

Reference-contexts: To guarantee computational efficiency the evaluation of dissimilarity values for block B i is restricted to a significantly reduced neighborhood N i , jN i j t N without loosing the discriminating properties <ref> [8] </ref>. The neighborhood consists of to appear as Technical Report, University of Kopenhagen 4 nearest neighbors given by the image topology and a larger number of random neighbors. In our experiments the four nearest and between 20 and 30 random neighbors were used. <p> More details about the application of meanfield approximations to optimization problems and extensions to unknown number of labels K can be found in [7] and the references in there.

The test database consisted of 100 mixtures of five textures each (as depicted in Fig. 1a), which were constructed randomly out of a representative set of 40 Brodatz-like micropat-terns.

The unnormalized cost function in contrast often misses full texture classes as is illustrated in Fig. 1e. The second question concerns the quality of the meanfield optimization algorithm as opposed to stochastic procedures.
