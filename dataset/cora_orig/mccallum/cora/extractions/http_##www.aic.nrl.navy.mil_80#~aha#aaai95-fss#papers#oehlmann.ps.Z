Abstract: Recent research in case-based reasoning suggests the use of metacognitive approaches to control the reasoning process. Whereas most of this research focuses on issues related to retrieval and representation, we describe a metacognitive approach to case adaptation based on the generation of questions and answers. The answer generation utilizes particular planning knowledge in the form of introspection plans and adaptation plans. An example of our implementation, IU-LIAN, will illustrate this process. Recent results in case-based reasoning have addressed the control of the reasoning process using ideas from metacognition. The term metacognition describes the "active monitoring and consequent regulation" of the agent's own cognitive processes (Flavell 1976). As a result, we can regard the term metacognition as describing two distinct but related issues: the issue of knowledge about cognition and the issue of regulating cognition. The first term includes awareness of the agent's resources with respect to the demands of the agent's thinking; for example, the availability of analogous knowledge during an analogical mapping task. The second issue involves self-regulating mechanisms such as planning, monitoring, and self-questioning (Brown 1987; Flavell & Wellman 1977; Nelson & Narens 1994; Ram 1991; Wong 1985). Such metacognitive skills should be improved with growing experience. Reasoners should be able to adapt and reuse such experience. The concept of reuse of previous experience has been exploited in the paradigm of case-based reasoning where previous experience is usually represented by cases (see Kolodner 1993 for an overview). Important components of the case-based reasoning approach are the retrieval of a previous case and the adaptation of this case to obtain a solution for the current problem (Hammond 1989; Hinrichs 1992; Jones 1992; Kass 1990; Ram 1992). If this approach is applied to plans, we refer to it as case-based planning (Hammond 1989). However, these earlier examples of adaptation planning do not use metacognitive strategies such as selection and monitoring. Therefore we have developed an approach to plan adaptation which represents the regulation of the adaptation process in the form of adaptation plans and introspection plans. Adaptation plans are used to perform the actual adaptation process, whereas introspection plans are used to monitor and to guide the adaptation process. The retrieval of these plans is supported by questions and answers which are also generated by case-based planning. Representing reasoning stages in the form of plans has the advantage that intentional content and context of the reasoning process can be accessed by metacognitive processes and can be learned. Within the framework of metacognitve adaptation, we investigated the central hypothesis: In particular, we will address the following issues: * Interleaving the adaptation process and the moni toring process to improve the adaptation result. In the remainder of the paper, we will describe our approach by means of an example involving the domains of electric circuits and systems of water pipes. We will then explain our approach of metacognitive adaptation and compare it with the adaptation mechanisms in the CHEF system (Hammond 1989). Finally, we will discuss the approach with respect to the general adaptation problem.
