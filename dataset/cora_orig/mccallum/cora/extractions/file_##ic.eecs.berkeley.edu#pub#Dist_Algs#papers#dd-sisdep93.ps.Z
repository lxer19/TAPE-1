Abstract: Three-dimensional concentration dependent diffusions and simultaneous chemical reactions in chemically-amplified photoresists are simulated. Fickian, a linearly increasing diffusivity and an exponentially increasing diffusivity due to free volume increase with T-BOC are considered. Two different grid to processor mappings are proposed in implementing the simulator on massively parallel processors using the Scharfetter and Gummel discretization method. Experimental and simulation results which support an exponential diffusion coefficient are illustrated.

Reference-contexts: A bidirectional link to the SAMPLE-3D lithography simulator is established for facilitating studies of 3D effects. 2. Computational Models A general model for two interacting and one dif fusing species summarized by the equations below is used <ref> [1] </ref>. , , , where C 1 is the concentration of activated sites, C 2 is the concentration of acid, k 1 is the reaction rate coefficient, and k 2 is the rate coefficient for the acid loss reaction.

Reference-contexts: To attain a more stable discretization, we adopt a technique proposed by Scharfetter and Gummel <ref> [4] </ref> which is now widely used for the discretization of the semiconductor device equations. The same approach is used for the discretization of the linear diffusion coefficient. Taking the limits of the linear dif fusion coefficient discretiza-tion, the discretization for the constant diffusion coefficient is obtained.

Reference-contexts: The nonlinear equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method and the second order trapezoidal method is used for numerical integration. The Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS) iterative algorithm is used to solve the unsymmetric sparse matrix. Incomplete LU decomposition with the partitioned natural ordering <ref> [5] </ref> is used as a preconditioner for the linear solver. At each time point, a nonlinear system of equations is solved using the New-ton-Raphson method. For each Newton-Raphson iteration, a linear system of equations is solved.

Reference-contexts: Hence, an 8k CM-2 with 256k bits of memory for each processor would allow a user to simulate a 512k mesh structure. The CM-5 mesh structure is divided into rectangular blocks each called a subdomain <ref> [6] </ref>. Each subdomain is mapped to a processor and the dimensions of the subdomains are equal in order to form cube partitions. This minimizes the total surface area which in turn minimizes the data length of communications between processors.

Reference-contexts: This minimizes the total surface area which in turn minimizes the data length of communications between processors. A simple row ordering is used to map the subdomains to the CM-5 processors since the fat tree connections allow minimal penalty for communications between arbitrary processors <ref> [7] </ref>. 5. Experimental and Simulation Results Preliminary experimental data illustrated in Figure 1 show evidence of diffusion effects in I.B.M. APEX-E resist profiles.

Reference-contexts: APEX-E resist profiles. A Fisher F-test shows that a linewidth loss linear in time best describes Figure 1 since a linear model provides smaller sums of residuals compared to a quadratic model <ref> [8] </ref>. Also, the resist tends to have very vertical sidewalls regardless of exposure or bake time which would suggest a vertical front is propagating laterally through the resist. <p> This high average forms a foot and top-lip on the resist prof ile which are usually not seen in experimental results. Only the exponential diffusion coefficient has sufficient vertical acid movement to nearly eliminate foot and top-lip formations. More experimental results are presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. b b l l
