The main difference is that instance hiding deals with databases of exponential size.

Reference-contexts: Private information retrieval [7] considers the case when the size of the database is feasible quantity and the number of databases is small (constant or logarithmic). Communication complexity. Several researchers have studied related problems in multiparty communication complexity. Pudlak, Rodl, Sgall [10, 11] and Ambainis <ref> [3] </ref> have considered the problem of computing x (i+j)modn where x is a string of n bits and i; j are integers in the following situation: Player 1 knows x; i, Player 2 knows x; j. Each of them sends one message to Player 3. <p> Another communication complexity problem was studied by Babai, Kim-mel and Lokam [4]. It also can be applied to private information retrieval. However, all these protocols are less efficient than the protocols for private information retrieval designed in [7]. Still, the ideas from <ref> [3, 4, 10, 11] </ref> (not explicit protocols) can be useful in the study of private information retrieval. Private information storage. Ostrovsky and Shoup [9] have extended the results of [7] and designed schemes for private information storage.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we can obtain nontrivial protocols for private information retrieval with o (n) communication.

Reference-contexts: In some scenarios, the opposite problem can appear: a user wishes to retrieve some infomation from a database without revealing to the database what information he needs. For example <ref> [7] </ref>, an investor wishes to receive information about certain stock but he does not wishe others (even the database) to know in which particular stock he is interesed. However, there is only one way to reach complete privacy: the user should ask for the copy of entire database. <p> Otherwise, the database will get some information what the user wishes to know. This is not a good solution because it requires much time and much communiction from the database to the user. 1 If there are several identical copies of the database, another scenario is possible <ref> [7] </ref>: The user asks a query to each database and combines the results of the queries, obtaining the desired information. Each query alone gives no information what user is interested in. Chor, Coldreich, Kushilevitz, Sudan [7] introduced this model and constructed several schemes for the private retrieval of one bit from <p> user. 1 If there are several identical copies of the database, another scenario is possible <ref> [7] </ref>: The user asks a query to each database and combines the results of the queries, obtaining the desired information. Each query alone gives no information what user is interested in. Chor, Coldreich, Kushilevitz, Sudan [7] introduced this model and constructed several schemes for the private retrieval of one bit from a database: 1. A scheme for 2 databases with O (n 1=3 ) communication. (n is the size of the database) 2. A scheme for k databases with O (n 1=k ) communication. 3. <p> In [1, 5, 6] the instance hiding problem has been studied.

Ostrovsky and Shoup [9] have extended the results of [7] and designed schemes for private information storage. Using their schemes, the user can both read and write to the database without revealing which bit is accessed. <p> There exists a protocol for private information retrieval with k databases and O (n 2k1 ) bits of communication. 4 Proof. By induction. The protocol for 2 databases was constructed by Chor, Goldreich, Kushile-vitz and Sudan <ref> [7] </ref>. The protocol for k databases is obtained as the combina tion of the protocols for 2 databases and (k 1) databases. First, we describe the 2 database protocol that we use to obtain a k database protocol from a (k 1) database protocol. 1.

This scheme has (k + 1) databases (k &gt; 2) and O (n 1=(2k1) log n) communication.
