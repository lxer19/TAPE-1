Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Growing size of VLSI circuits, along with the high transistor density, is making minimization of power dissipation an important issue in VLSI design. Power dissipation issues are addressed at various stages of circuit design. For example, circuits are synthesized so that average switching activity is reduced <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>, technology mapping can be targeted for low power dissipation [4, 5], and physical design can be targeted for low power dissipation [6]. Power dissipation issues during test application must also be addressed. The motivation for this is discussed in section 2. <p> The total power dissipation P total is given by :- P total = P st + P d + P sc . As in <ref> [1] </ref> P st and P sc are neglected. P d is power required to charge and discharge the output capacitive load of every gate.

Reference-contexts: In [7] scheduling tests to minimize power dissipation in circuits containing BIST hardware is discussed. In this paper we address this problem for two different scan test structures viz. Full Isolated Scan, Full Integrated Scan <ref> [8] </ref>. These test structures are discussed in Section 4 wherein we also discuss how to account for all the power that is dissipated during test application when tests are applied using these test structures. Before that, in section 3, we discuss models for accounting for power dissipation. <p> Thus, by traversing a given combinational network in a topological order, the number of transitions can be computed using the above tables and the value of M min and M max in linear time. 4. Scan Structures Block diagram of Full Isolated Scan is shown in Figure 2 (a) <ref> [8] </ref>. R 0 is the system register and R s is the test register where the tests are scanned in serially. A test vector is loaded into R s in N clock cycles where N is the number of F/Fs in the scan chain. <p> In cycle N + 3 the contents of R 0 are transferred to R s . During the next N cycles the output response is scanned out while the next input vector is scanned in. This scan technique is different from Full Integrated Scan <ref> [8] </ref> where, as shown in Figure 2 (b), R s ; R 0 are merged to form one register R s . <p> In Full 4 Isolated Scan, unlike Full Integrated Scan, as a new vector is scanned into R s the state of R 0 , i.e. the inputs to the combinational circuit C, is not changed <ref> [8] </ref> . To account for power dissipation in Full Isolated Scan assume the response to T 1 is in R s , T 2 is to be scanned in and the response of T 1 to be scanned out.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we restrict ourselves to the heuristic for the first problem. Preliminary experimental results of these algorithms are provided in section 7. They are quite encouraging. 2. Motivation To understand the reason for this we briefly discuss the stages a die passes through during its life span <ref> [9] </ref>. Broadly speaking they are: (a) The dies are etched on the wafer; (b) The dies are tested and cut out from the wafer; (c) The defective dies are removed and the good ones are packaged.

Reference-contexts: Thus, whether we are interested in improving die-yield, chip-yield, IC cost or system reliability we ought be concerned with the power requirements during testing and attempt to reduce it. 3. Power Dissipation Model The two components of power dissipated in a CMOS circuit <ref> [10] </ref> are: Static dissipation due to leakage current or other current drawn continuously from the power supply (P st ) and dynamic dissipation due to (i) switching transient current (P sc ) and (ii) charging and discharging of load capacitances (P d ).
