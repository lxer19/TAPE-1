Abstract: This paper uses ideas from artificial intelligence to show how default notions can be defined over Scott domains. We combine these ideas with ideas arising in domain theory to shed some light on the properties of nonmonotonicity in a general model-theoretic setting. We consider in particular a notion of default nonmonotonic entailment between prime open sets in the Scott topology of a domain. We investigate in what ways this notion obeys the so-called laws of cautious monotony and cautious cut, proposed by Gabbay, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor. Our notion of nonmonotonic entailment does not necessarily satisfy cautious monotony, but does satisfy cautious cut. In fact, we show that any reasonable notion of nonmonotonic entailment on prime opens over a Scott domain, satisfying in particular the law of cautious cut, can be concretely represented using our notion of default entailment. We also give a variety of sufficient conditions for defaults to induce cumulative entailments, those satisfying cautious monotony. In particular, we show that defaults with unique extensions are a representation of cumulative nonmonotonic entailment. Furthermore, a simple characterization is given for those default sets which determine unique extensions in coherent domains. Finally, a characterization is given for Scott domains in which default entailment must be cumulative. This is the class of daisy domains; it is shown to be cartesian closed, a purely domain-theoretic result.

Reference-contexts: This means that defaults are indeed a very general way of capturing a notion of nonmonotonic entailment. Entailments, in general, should work at the level of logical statements. In the domain logic paradigm <ref> [1, 18] </ref>, the correspondence goes from domains to types, open sets to properties, and points to computations. So, strictly speaking, entailments should be at the level of Scott open sets.

Reference-contexts: However, the following properties are often considered undesirable: * There can be multiple extensions. * Extensions may not exist. 2 * Even when they do exist, it can be too costly or impossible to find them. * Default logic does not support the familiar principle of reasoning by cases <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. * Standard entailment in default logic fails to have the so-called cumulativity property [4]. A possible reason why the current approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning may be that the approaches presume the syntax and the total model theory used in classical first order logic 1 .

Reference-contexts: A basic property of this entailment is monotonicity: if entails and 0 , then 0 entails . In the nonmonotonic case, what kind of entailment is appropriate? A considerable amount of work has been devoted to this basic question since the work of Gabbay <ref> [3] </ref>. Because there is no widely accepted model theory for nonmonotonic entailment, most other work does not follow the tradition in standard Tarskian logic: postulates about properties of nonmonotonic entailment come first, models next. <p> Cautious monotony is a nice property to have because it makes the nonmonotonic entailment cumulative: if from a one expects many things, and if nothing unexpected happens, then none of the expected things need to be withdrawn. 15 Since Gabbay <ref> [3] </ref>, a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the study of cumulativity. As mentioned earlier, our work here differs from other work in the following fundamental way: the other work assumes cautious monotony, and then searches for models having this property.

A possible reason why the current approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning may be that the approaches presume the syntax and the total model theory used in classical first order logic 1 . <p> As the name suggests, monotonicity, which states that if a ; b and a 0 w a, then a 0 ; b, does not hold in general for a nonmonotonic entailment. Note that Reflexivity and Right Weakening implies what Gardenfors and Makinson <ref> [4] </ref> call the axiom of Supraclassicality: a v b ) b ; a: Supraclassicality means that nonmonotonic entailment includes all classical entailment as special instances. The first four axioms for nonmonotonic entailment are self-explanatory. We explain the axiom of Cautious cut in more detail.

Reference-contexts: The usual interpretation of X ; a (where ; stands for the nonmonotonic entailment relation) is that from the information X we can jump to the conclusion a. Many authors, in particular Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor <ref> [5] </ref>, have considered Gabbay's axiom of cautious monotony: X ; a & X ; b ) X; a ; b: Reasoning with the assumption of this law, together with some other routine axioms, is sometimes called cumulative reasoning.

Reference-contexts: A more precise notion of only knowing should also deal with the notion of `independence', the idea that two pieces of information are not related. This has been discussed in the probabilistic literature (e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>), but not extensively in the logical literature. All of this may be better treated in a version of first order logic. The present paper, however, takes the simple minded view of `only knowing'.

One can easily construct examples where cautious monotony fails when q is not disjunction-free, as we have seen earlier. In <ref> [14] </ref>, we proved that cautious monotony holds for precondition-free defaults, again assuming that q is disjunction-free. Cautious Cut. As before, let m be a minimal element of p, and e the extension of m. <p> In fact, cautious cut follows from either the property of unique extension or the property of disjointness of stable neighborhoods individually. The above verification did not use disjointness of stable neighborhoods. A proof that cautious cut follows from disjointness of stable neighborhoods can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Finally, note that Right Or only holds when extensions are unique. 2

Reference-contexts: Finally, nonmonotonic entailment is extended to general Scott open sets, and several results for this case are provided. 2 Defaults in domain theory Originally, default model theory was based on default information structures, augmenting a concrete representation of Scott domains called information systems <ref> [15] </ref>. In accordance with the cpo-theoretic tradition of domain theory, we present a version of default model theory based directly on Scott domains (note that the use of Scott domains is purely for simplicity; we expect many results presented here to generalize to other classes of domains).

Reference-contexts: There is growing awareness in AI of the importance of the idea: see, for example, the book on the topic <ref> [16] </ref>. Our contribution in this respect is merely a new technical tool. In particular, though, it focuses on the concept of observability as the kind of property from which we can jump to new conclusions. Domain theory has provided quite a lot of insight into structures of partial information.

In the rest of this section we present a characterization result for this purpose. In <ref> [17] </ref> an effective, sufficient condition is given for unique extensions. However, that condition is not necessary. We now give a very simple condition which is both sufficient and necessary for unique extensions on coherent Scott domains (an effective characterization of unique extensions on general Scott domains remains unsolved).
