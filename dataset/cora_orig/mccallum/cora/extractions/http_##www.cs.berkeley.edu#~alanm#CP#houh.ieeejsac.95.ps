Abstract: This architecture presents several advantages over the traditional workstation-centric models including the ability to easily share network-based devices, to access non-local devices, and to relieve the workstation of a portion of the I/O work. This paper describes the philosophy, implementation choices, advantages, and limitations of the VuNet ATM network implementation, as well as performance and current status.

Reference-contexts: The focus of the VuNet is desk-area in scope, so network bridges will be used to connect to local-area and wide-area ATM networks. This section describes the current suite of devices which constitute the VuNet. Further details on these devices are given in <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. 4.1 Host Interfaces Many host interfaces in other systems provide support for packet reassembly [8, 14] and streaming [8, 20]. In many of these host interfaces which support packet reassembly, the interface provides buffering on a per-VCI basis and only interrupts the processor when full packets are received. <p> The Vidboard is the limiting factor in the case of the color streams, since the color dithering algorithm is computationally intensive. The frame rates presented here represent an improvement over those mentioned in our previous results <ref> [1] </ref>. This improvement is due to two factors: an improved host interface with DMA capabilities and a daughterboard for the Vidboard that performs dithering in hardware. One of the benefits of our software-intensive approach is the ability to display multiple windows at various frame rates.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving this cell, the Vid-board captures and transmits a single video frame. For sending video data from the Vidboard to a workstation, a transport protocol similar to that specified by the ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) standard <ref> [2] </ref> has been adopted. In this protocol, cells are grouped into larger packets called transmission frames (t-frames) as shown in Figure 11 5 . The LF parameter in the command cell specifies the number of video scan lines that are to be packed into one t-frame.

Aurora is a SONET-based ATM testbed connecting MIT, Bellcore, UPenn, and IBM (Figure 8). The Aurora-VuNet link (AVlink) allows the VuNet to in-teroperate with the Aurora wide area facilities (Figure 7).

This is comparable to the Bellcore Osiris interface <ref> [8] </ref>, which can achieve a maximum input throughput of 463 Mbps. VuNet host interfaces exist for the DEC Tur-boChannel, S-Bus, and NuBus; however, only the DEC 5000s and Alphas, which are based on the Tur-boChannel, have been fully integrated into the network using the DMA interface.

Reference-contexts: The Pandora approach fits into the dedicated hardware style of media delivery. Very specialized hardware is built which allows decent performance, but prevents taking advantage of gains in performance elsewhere in the system. More recently, a few projects have attacked multimedia systems from the network perspective. The Atomic approach <ref> [9] </ref> uses a networking chip designed for multiprocessing. The network chips are used to interconnect the various subsystems such as a display, camera, DSP, and monitor. The Atomic approach uses specialized network hardware as a multimedia workstation's internal network.

Reference-contexts: In designing the VudBoard, we carefully selected the point of attachment between the host and the VuNet. Alternative approaches include a coprocessor style interface and direct connection to the cache or memory systems. We chose our attachment point from our experience with coprocessor style network interfaces <ref> [10] </ref> and our desire not to interfere in the cache/memory hierarchy. We rely on the host's memory system to augment the switch's burst absorption capacity. 6 4.1.1 Operating Systems Issues The kernel interface to the VuNet is through the Berkeley UNIX sockets framework.

Reference-contexts: Between each if these levels, buffer queues provide for transfer of data. 4.1.3 Input Polling Instead of device interrupts, we used periodic timer callouts to poll the VudBoard. This scheme is similar to clocked interrupts discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. When a timer callout executes, the status of the VudBoard is polled. If any cells have been received, the device driver suspends input DMA, swaps the filled input buffers with empty buffers, and restarts input DMA. It then queues for reassembly the input buffers that contain the cells.

Reference-contexts: They routing. can also cause the link to emit a cell containing table entries, so link tables can be read back. 3.3.2 VCI and Connection Management Cells in the VuNet are relayed hop-by-hop as they pass through the links. This is in contrast to other systems <ref> [18] </ref> which include this function in the switch. An advantage of our approach is that it teases the ATM level cell processing out of the switch ports and associates it with the individual end systems and links.
