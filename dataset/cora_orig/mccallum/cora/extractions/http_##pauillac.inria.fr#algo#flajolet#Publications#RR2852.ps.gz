Reference-contexts: For dominant asymptotics, we can freely restrict attention to polynomial products and gcd's whose costs can be taken under the standard form product: t 1 n 2 ; gcd: t 2 n 2 : 2. Summary of results It is well-known <ref> [1, 16] </ref> that a random polynomial of degree n is irreducible with probability tending to 0 and has close to log n factors on average and with a high probability [4, 10]. Thus, the factorization of a random polynomial over a finite field is almost surely nontrivial. <p> Basic methodology This paper relies heavily on a symbolic use of generating functions (GF's). These are used to express enumerative properties of random polynomials and also to derive direct asymptotic results from singularities. General references are Chapter 3 of Berlekamp's book <ref> [1] </ref>, the exercise section 4.6.2 of Knuth's book [16], and the paper by Flajolet and Odlyzko [9] for asymptotic methods. 3.1. Generating functions. We specialize our discussion to polynomials over a finite field F q . Let I be the collection of monic irreducible polynomials. <p> Since P n has value q n , we have P (z) = (1 qz) 1 , and the second relation of (2) implicitly determines I n by a well-known process based on Moebius 4 Flajolet, Gourdon, and Panario inversion <ref> [1] </ref> I n = n kjn (k)q n=k ; so that I n = q n + O q n=2 I (z) = k=1 k 1 Thus a fraction extremely close to 1=n of all polynomials of degree n are irreducible.

Reference-contexts: We have elected here to consider a classical factorization chain over finite fields that is at the same time simple, fairly efficient, and complete. It is close to what is used internally in the Maple computer algebra system <ref> [12] </ref> and to what is likely to be required of a general purpose computer algebra system that mostly deals with polynomials of intermediate "size". Our factorization chain may not be the fastest at the moment, compare for instance with Shoup's technique [24]. <p> All average-case analyses are expressed as asymptotic forms in n, the degree of the polynomial to be factored. We fix a finite field F q with q = p m (p prime) and consider the polynomial ring F q [x], see <ref> [12, 16, 19] </ref>. For simplicity of exposition, we assume here that the characteristic p is odd, but the algorithms and their analyses can be easily adapted to the otherwise important cases of F 2 and F 2 m . <p> In characteristic 0, this is achieved by the gcd of f and its derivative f 0 . In finite characteristics, additional control is needed in order to deal with pth powers whose derivatives are 0, see <ref> [12, 16] </ref>. <p> In finite characteristics, additional control is needed in order to deal with pth powers whose derivatives are 0, see [12, 16]. The auxiliary computation of pth roots, g 1=p , is performed in the classical way described in <ref> [12, p. 344] </ref> for example. procedure ERF (f : polynomial); g := gcd (f,f'); h := f/g; k := gcd (g,h); while k&lt;&gt;1 do g := g/k; k := gcd (g,h) od; if g &lt;&gt; 1 then h := h*ERF (g^(1/p)) fi; return (h); end; Theorem 1. (i) A random polynomial <p> First, the overall cost of the recursive calls (Step 4 in the top-level procedure) remains O (1) on average. Next, alternative strategies giving the full squarefree factorization <ref> [12, p.345] </ref> have asymptotically equivalent costs. Finally, the ERF phase has a cost dominated by its first gcd.

This gives rise to a useful heuristic for large field cardinalities. An instance is mentioned in <ref> [13] </ref> in connection with the probability that a random polynomial admits factors of distinct degrees which, for large q and large n is found to approach e fl . Our Theorem 6 illustrates an instance of this situation. 4.

Reference-contexts: Our reference chain uses the classical Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm [3].

Reference-contexts: For each nontrivial factor b k , it involves a recursive refinement process again based on properties of finite fields. The analysis is close to that of digital trees known as "tries" <ref> [15] </ref> but under a biased probability model. Precise statements are given in the next few pages with an explicit dependency on the field cardinality q, and some of them involve number-theoretic functions that can be both evaluated and estimated easily. <p> Our reference chain uses the classical Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm [3].
