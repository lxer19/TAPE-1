Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Design optimization in aerodynamics and propulsion has always been of high interest, and therefore received strong attention very early <ref> [1] </ref>. The direct result of improvement in the computer technology is a growing interest in automated design techniques aimed at achieving better designs in a shorter period of time than classical methods (i.e., by hand or extensive analysis).

Reference-contexts: The first category is gradient-based algorithms which use local information to search part of the design space and find the local minimum 1 . These methods are able to solve non-linear problems together with inequality and equality constraints. Many local methods are available <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], e.g. adjoint, single or multi-grid preconditioners, alternating 1 An optimization problem can be recast as a minimization problem with no loss of generality. For example, maximizing a function f is equivalent to minimizing -f. 2 direction implicit methods, control theory [4], etc.

Reference-contexts: Many local methods are available [2], [3], e.g. adjoint, single or multi-grid preconditioners, alternating 1 An optimization problem can be recast as a minimization problem with no loss of generality. For example, maximizing a function f is equivalent to minimizing -f. 2 direction implicit methods, control theory <ref> [4] </ref>, etc. These methods are fast and accurate; however, they are typically unable to find the global optimum of the entire design space and are inefficient in discrete design spaces. The second category is stochastic algorithms which attempt to take into consideration the whole search space.

Reference-contexts: This category includes genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, pseudo-time methods, random search, etc. These global methods are more likely to converge towards a global optimum rather than a local one. Furthermore, they are able to deal with discontinuous design spaces <ref> [5] </ref>. However, these kinds of optimization techniques are more expensive in computational time than the first category, since they typically require substantially more design evaluations. Among the global methods, the most successful and popular to date are Genetic Algorithms [6,7]. <p> Genetic Algorithms are search algorithms that mimic the behavior of natural selection to solve given problems <ref> [5] </ref>. These algorithms first generate a random collection (population) of potential solutions (individuals or candidates). Using mutations and recombinations (crossover) operations, they evolve the population towards better solutions, as individuals become adapted to the problem faced.

Reference-contexts: Among the global methods, the most successful and popular to date are Genetic Algorithms [6,7]. They are based upon evolutionary principles and will be described in further detail in section 2. Other optimization techniques are available and do not enter into the previously defined categories. Examples are one-shot methods <ref> [8] </ref> or inverse methods [9,10]. Optimization techniques have been applied to a wide range of design problems, from conceptual design to Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO). Within the aerospace industry, optimization techniques have made a significant contribution to the design of highly complicated systems involving many design parameters and constraints.

Typically, the objective is to achieve a low-drag and high-lift wing together with structural or geometric constraints.

Reference-contexts: In the propulsion 3 domain some previous works have been carried out with gradient-based optimizers which were successfully used for designing or re-designing of hypersonic and supersonic intakes and nozzles [23]-[29]. Missile shapes have also been considered through optimization <ref> [30] </ref>. The actual trend is to use several analysis tools and broaden the design optimization so that the optimization becomes multidisciplinary [31,32]. Furthermore, engineers are looking forward to including more artificial intelligence into the optimization methods with a view to achieve faster convergence toward the global optimum [33].

Reference-contexts: GADO 3 is the name of this special GA. A preliminary version of GADO has been used in this research, and did not include all the modules described in the thesis <ref> [36] </ref>. Classical GAs make the formal population evolve generation after generation, losing track of the history information along the search. <p> That is to say that the penalty function is equal to zero. GADO includes several specific implementations and modules that have been incorporated with a view to accelererate the convergence of the search process towards the global optimum. This GA has demonstrated its effectiveness in several engineering optimization problems <ref> [36] </ref>. Moreover, it has proved to be quicker and more likely to converge towards the global optimum 3 GADO is an acronym for Genetic Algorithm for Design Optimization 7 than classical GAs, gradient-based methods or random probe processes.

It is a 2-D or 3-D Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes solver which employs high resolution upwind schemes for the invicid fluxes and the central differencing for the viscous fluxes. An implicit two-factor AF scheme is used in the spanwise plane and relaxation sweeping is used in the streamwise direction.
