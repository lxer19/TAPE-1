Interestingly, Hamilton <ref> [13] </ref>, made use of determinants in deriving Halley's function. In fact Hamilton does make use of the determinant of the matrix L (1) m (x), to arrive at high order methods, but he does not obtain B m (x) for any m 4. <p> For instance he obtains a forth-order method which is different than B 4 (x) (see page 521, <ref> [13] </ref>). The algebraic characterization and the existence of the Basic Family was proved in [16]. The present paper gives further characterizations, closed formula for its members, their corresponding asymptotic constant, and thus offers a deeper understanding of each of its individual members, including Newton's and Halley's functions.

Reference-contexts: Gerlach however offers no closed formula for G m (x). Moreover, the domain of G m 's is very restrictive. Indeed the computation of G m (x) is too cumbersome and Gerlach only obtains G 4 (x) for p (x) = x 3 ff. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the closed formula for B m (x) corresponding to this cubic polynomial as well as to p (x) = x 2 ff was obtained. Indeed for general functions, B 4 (x) had been obtained previously and through different schemes by Snyder [21], Traub [23](page 91), and others. <p> In particular, the closed form of the Basic Family suggests parallel implementations (see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref> for a theoretical analysis of parallel implementation of the Basic Family as applied to square-root computation). Another theoretical and practical problem of interest is the study of global convergence of the Basic Family. Acknowledgments.

Definition 1.1. <p> We will give two formulas for generating new members of S (m; M ) with higher orders. Both formulas make use of the following relationship which is a consequence of Taylor's Theorem, but can also be derived using purely algebraic means (see <ref> [16] </ref>) 0 = i=0 i! From (1:11) we have p (x) = i=1 i! Writing x = ( x); (1:13) and adding corresponding sides to (1.12) we get B 1 (x) x p (x) = + (p 0 (x) 1)( x) + i=2 i! From (1.11) we also immediately get Newton's <p> Another theoretical and practical problem of interest is the study of global convergence of the Basic Family. Acknowledgments. We would like to thank Professor Steve Smale, [20], for suggesting the examination of existence of possible links between the Basic Family (whose algebraic existence was proved in <ref> [16] </ref>) and the Euler-Schroder family.

As an application of the above consider the replacement of f in Newton's method with f (x)=f 0 (x) which results in a new iteration function g (x) credited to Schroder (e.g. see Scavo and Thoo <ref> [18] </ref>). Then, from the corollary g 00 ()=2 can easily be computed in terms of f and its higher derivatives. Remark 5.1. The assumption f 2 C 2m1 in the above corollary can be relaxed for B m (x). It suffice to have f 2 C m .
