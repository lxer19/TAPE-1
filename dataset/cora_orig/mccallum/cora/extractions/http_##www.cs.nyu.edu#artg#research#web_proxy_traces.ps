Abstract: This paper studies the caching characteristics of HTTP requests and responses that pass through production Web proxies. We evaluate caching opportunities and problems. Traces with 5.9 million entries from a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) and 2.0 million entries from an Intranet firewall are studied. We find maximum cache hit rate opportunities of about 40% for an ISP and 70% for an Intranet. Cache size needs and document residence times are also examined.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Caching proxies [LUOT94] play an important role in IP networks, enhancing security, conserving bandwidth and potentially improving performance by reducing response time (e.g. <ref> [ABRA95] </ref> and [HAMI98]). Designing and deploying proxies is challenging work because proxies are subject to complex inputs which can be summarized as a request stream and associated responses.

Reference-contexts: The large gap between HR (-RFC) and HR (-ACTUAL) partly occurs because Squid 1.21 never caches documents with cookies although the HTTP/1.1 specification ([FIEL97], Section 13) lets the origin server to specify whether such documents are cacheable. Our analysis program [PEVZ98] follows RFC 2068. According to <ref> [CACE98] </ref>, the analysis of an ISP traces showed that over 30% of all responses contained cookies. <p> Each cacheable entry was classified as refreshed if it was marked accordingly in the log. About 66% of all entries Other factors may also have a significant impact. In <ref> [CACE98] </ref>, for example, it was determined that bandwidth savings can largely depend on the way proxy handles client interrupts, especially if client-to-proxy bandwidth is significantly smaller than proxy-to-originserver bandwidth. were marked as cacheable, and 1% were marked as refreshed.

We examined traces collected between June 8 and 13, 1998. <p> This log has very few entries for Tuesday, June 9, suggesting that the proxy server was down or being maintained on that day. The log consisted of 5.9 million entries or about 983300 entries per day. The traces were in Netscape Extended-2 log format <ref> [NETS97] </ref> with a record for each request-response pair containing the following fields, among others: max-uncheck is the maximum time allowed between consecutive up-to-date checks. 2 lm-factor is used to estimate the duration for which the document will remain unchanged, which is know as the expiration time. <p> For the Prodigy traces, where the HTTP headers were not available, the cache status trace field <ref> [NETS97] </ref> were used to determine cacheability. For UBS, the HTTP/1.1 Specification was used to determine cacheability. See the implementation at [PEVZ98].
