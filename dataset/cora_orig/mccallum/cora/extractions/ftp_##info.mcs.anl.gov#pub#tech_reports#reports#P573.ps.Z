Abstract: In this paper we describe an interactive virtual environment developed to model an emission reduction system for commercial boilers. The interactive environment is used to optimize the performance of the reduction system through the spatial adjustment and spray reconfiguration of reagent injectors. We describe the three principal components of the system: a computational model for the particle dynamics, a three-dimensional display device and graphics environment, and the communication layer that allows the interaction of the user in the visualization environment with the computational model. Timing results for each component are given for three hardware configurations that demonstrate the real-time performance of this tool.

Reference-contexts: Hence, these components must be able to communicate with each other in an effective, low-cost manner. In addition, this communication layer must be portable so that the numerical calculations can be performed on a variety of architectures ranging from SGI workstations to the IBM SP. The CAVEcomm library <ref> (Disz, Papka, and Stevens 1995) </ref> developed at Argonne National Laboratory provides the performance aspects needed, and we use this as our message-passing interface.

Reference-contexts: Both the simulation code and the graphics code use the MPI clock MPI Wtime () <ref> (Gropp, Lusk and Skjellum 1994) </ref> to record elapsed wall clock time for the components of interest. All communication using CAVEcomm is performed asynchronously, and we estimate the data transmission times using the effective rates given by ttcp.

Reference-contexts: Succeeding configurations are determined on the basis of numerical experiments in which injector location and specific spray configuration are adjusted to optimize performance. Promising injector configurations are tested further by fully coupling the CFD model to the spray simulation and calculating the chemical reactions and kinetic interactions <ref> (Patankar 1980) </ref>. The result of this calculation is critical to the modeling effort, because it predicts the effectiveness and life cycle cost of the pollution control system. The previous two steps are performed iteratively until the injection system has obtained optimal performance.
