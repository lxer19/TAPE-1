Abstract: Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deteriorating performance when tested on long strings. This deteriorating performance can be attributed to the instability of the internal representation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidal discriminant function together with the recurrent structure contribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparse interconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function such that the internal DFA state representations are stable, i.e. the constructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length. The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into the neural network. We derive a relationship between the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robust string classification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols, the constructive algorithm generates a "programmed" neural network with O(n) neurons and O(mn) weights. We compare our algorithm to other methods proposed in the literature.

Reference-contexts: This is important when we use a network for domain theory revision [20, 28, 31], where the prior knowledge is not only incomplete, but may also be incorrect [13, 23]. Methods for constructing DFAs in recurrent networks where neurons have hard-limiting discriminant functions have been proposed <ref> [1, 19, 22] </ref>. This paper is concerned with neural network implementations of DFAs where continuous sigmoidal discriminant functions are used. <p> conjecture holds true: Conjecture 5.10.1 If any one of the conditions is violated, then the languages accepted by the constructed network and the given DFA are not identical for an arbitrary distribution of the randomly initialized weights in the interval [W; W ]. 5.11 Comparison with other Methods Different methods <ref> [1, 5, 6, 19, 22] </ref> for encoding DFAs with n states and m input symbols in recurrent networks are summarized in table 1. <p> The methods differ in the choice of the discriminant function (hard-limiting, sigmoidal, radial basis function), the size of the constructed network and the restrictions that are imposed on the weight alphabet, the neuron fan-in and fan-out. The results in [19] improve the upper and lower bounds reported in <ref> [1] </ref> for DFAs with only two input symbols. Those bounds can be generalized to DFAs with m input symbols [18]. <p> Among the methods which use continuous discriminant functions, our algorithm uses no more neurons than the best of all methods, and consistently uses fewer weights and smaller fan-out size than all methods. 5.12 Open Problems One of the theoretical results in <ref> [1] </ref> gives a lower bound of ( p nlogn) on the number of hard-limiting neurons needed to implement a DFA with n states when the weight alphabet and the neuron fan-in are limited.

Reference-contexts: This deteriorating performance can be explained by observing that the internal DFAstate representation becomes unstable with increasing string length due to the network's dynamical nature and the sigmoidal discriminant function. This phenomenon has also been observed by others <ref> [3, 30, 33] </ref>. We encoded a randomly generated, minimized 100-state DFA with alphabet = f0; 1g into a recurrent network with 101 state neurons.

Reference-contexts: Continuous sigmoids offer other advantages besides their use in gradient-based training algorithms; they also permit analog VLSI implementation, the foundations necessary for the universal approximation theories of neural networks, the interpretation of neural network outputs as a posteriori probability estimates, etc. For more details see <ref> [14] </ref>. Stability of an internal DFA state representation implies that the output of the sigmoidal state neurons assigned to DFA states saturate at high gain; a constructed discrete-time network thus has stable periodic 2 orbits.

Reference-contexts: For more details see [14]. Stability of an internal DFA state representation implies that the output of the sigmoidal state neurons assigned to DFA states saturate at high gain; a constructed discrete-time network thus has stable periodic 2 orbits. A saturation result has previously been proven for continuous-time networks <ref> [15] </ref>; for sufficiently high gain, the output along a stable limit cycle is saturated almost all the time. There is no known analog of this for stable periodic orbits of discrete-time networks.

Reference-contexts: There is no known analog of this for stable periodic orbits of discrete-time networks. The only known stability result asserts that for a broad class of discrete-time networks where all output neurons are either self-inhibiting or self-exciting, outputs at stable fixed points saturate at high gain <ref> [16] </ref>. Our proof of stability of an internal DFA state representation establishes such a result for a special case of discrete-time recurrent networks. Our method is an alternative to an algorithm for constructing DFAs in recurrent networks with first-order weights proposed by Frasconi et al. [7, 5].

Reference-contexts: For enhanced performance, some of these neural network algorithms are mapped directly into VLSI designs [21, 29]. The performance of neural networks can be enhanced by encoding a priori knowledge about the problem directly into the networks <ref> [8, 28] </ref>. This work discusses how known finite state automata rules can be encoded into a recurrent neural network with sigmoid activation neurons in such a way that arbitrary long string sequences are always correctly recognized a stable encoding of rules. <p> When partial symbolic knowledge is encoded into a network in order to improve training, programming as few weights as possible is desirable because it leaves the network with many unbiased adaptable weights. This is important when we use a network for domain theory revision <ref> [20, 28, 31] </ref>, where the prior knowledge is not only incomplete, but may also be incorrect [13, 23]. Methods for constructing DFAs in recurrent networks where neurons have hard-limiting discriminant functions have been proposed [1, 19, 22].

Reference-contexts: This deteriorating performance can be explained by observing that the internal DFAstate representation becomes unstable with increasing string length due to the network's dynamical nature and the sigmoidal discriminant function. This phenomenon has also been observed by others <ref> [3, 30, 33] </ref>. We encoded a randomly generated, minimized 100-state DFA with alphabet = f0; 1g into a recurrent network with 101 state neurons.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this encoding methodology permits rules to be mapped into neural network VLSI chips, offering the potential of greatly increasing the versatility of neural network implementations. 1.2 Background Recurrent neural networks can be trained to behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) <ref> [4, 7, 9, 11, 26, 27, 32] </ref>. The dynamical nature of recurrent networks can cause the internal representation of learned DFA states to deteriorate for long strings [33]; therefore, it can be difficult to make predictions about the generalization performance of trained recurrent networks.
