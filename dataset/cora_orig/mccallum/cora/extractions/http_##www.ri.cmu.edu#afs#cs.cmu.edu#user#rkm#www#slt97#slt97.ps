Abstract: Some Results on Search Complexity vs Accuracy ABSTRACT This paper presents three different techniques applied in or developed during the 1996 Hub-4 broadcast news transcription task. First, an efficient shortest path graph search algorithm is applied to the word lattice created by Viterbi search, producing a globally optimum result. This reduces the word error rate by about 3-10% (relative), depending on the test set. The execution time is at or close to real time for most utterances. Second, a segmented N-best list generation algorithm is described for producing compact N-best lists for very long utterances. Finally, a temporal smoothing technique is compared to deleted interpolation. On one test set, temporal smoothing reduces the error rate by 3% for an 8% increase in search cost, while the latter improves by 6% for a 50% increase in search cost.

Reference-contexts: The shortest path graph search enables us to find the globally optimum word sequence in the word lattice. This hypothesis is also injected into the N-best list. The final recognition results after rescoring the N-best list are presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this section we evaluate the shortest path search algorithm. <p> In creating the DAG, additional links must be created to bypass noise word nodes, increasing the size of the DAG significantly. Our implementation aborts a DAG search if pre-specified computational or memory limits are exceeded. 2.2. Experimental Results As described in <ref> [1] </ref>, the CMU evaluation run consisted of two phases. In phase-1, the test set was decoded using conventional Viterbi beam search, followed by the best path DAG search algorithm. The result of the latter was used for unsupervised MLLR adaptation. In phase-2, the adapted acoustic models were used for decoding.
