Reference-contexts: Today there are two common approaches to structural alignment. First, one may associate a secondary structure type (ff-helix, fi-sheet or random coil) with each residue and then impose the additional constraint that only residues associated with the same type of secondary structure may be aligned (for example, <ref> [1, 29] </ref>). This type of structural alignment is often done manually. Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see [38, 39], for an example). Structural and functional information has been used to validate multiple sequence alignments.

Reference-contexts: A variant on tree alignment is star alignment (SA), in which it is assumed that the underlying tree is a star. Restricting the topology makes this approach much more tractable, and it has been used as an underlying structure in many algorithms and analyses (e.g., <ref> [2, 15] </ref>). Altschul and Lipman [2] pointed out that SP, TA and SA costs for the same column can be very different, as shown in Figure 1. <p> Restricting the topology makes this approach much more tractable, and it has been used as an underlying structure in many algorithms and analyses (e.g., [2, 15]).

Reference-contexts: Residues that maximize d ( ^ P 1 [j]; : : : ; ^ P k [j]) should belong together. Three cost functions commonly used to evaluate each column are sum-of-pairs (SP), tree alignment (TA) and star alignment (SA). The sum-of-pairs cost <ref> [24, 3] </ref> of a column ^ P 1 [j]; : : : ; ^ P k [j] is the sum of the costs of all unordered pairs in the column d SP ( ^ P 1 [j]; : : : ; ^ P k [j]) = p&lt;q for some binary cost

Reference-contexts: Barton and Sternberg <ref> [5] </ref> have also used structural alignments to validate sequence-based alignments. The use of structural information to guide or validate alignments is only possible for data sets where structural information is available.

Reference-contexts: Residues with different evolutionary histories within a single gene can also occur due to horizontal gene transfer, the transfer of genetic material between species. For example, sequences similar to the Fn3 module in fibronectin have been found in bacterial proteins <ref> [6] </ref>. Fibronectin is a protein found in animals. Since Fn3 is found in both bacterial and animal proteins, one would expect to find Fn3 modules throughout the tree of life. However, Fn3 sequences have not been found in simpler eukaryotes, plants or fungi [6], suggesting a direct transfer of genetic material <p> fibronectin have been found in bacterial proteins <ref> [6] </ref>.

For conctretness, we define an algorithm to be consistent with respect to some parameter k of data size (e.g., number of species for MSA or sequence length for phylogeny) if it converges to the true solution as k goes to infinity.

Reference-contexts: The LDL receptor gene was shown to share exons with genes for epidermal growth factor, blood clotting factor IX and complementation factor C9. Since then, many such "mosaic" genes have been discovered (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a survey). In aligning mosaic genes, a different tree may be needed for each exon. If the exon boundaries are known, each exon could be aligned separately. However for many sequences, the splice sites have not been determined.

Reference-contexts: We say f is strongly consistent if f is *-consistent for every constant *. In our example above, function g is * consistent, for any * &lt; 1=2, while function h is strongly consistent. For phylogeny, a strongly consistent cost function was proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>. It was possible to do so in the case of phylogeny because the stochastic process relating phylogenies to DNA is well understood.

Reference-contexts: One situation where this occurs is exon shu*ing. Most vertebrate genes consist of coding regions (exons) separated by DNA segments that are not translated into proteins (introns). The discovery of this intron/exon structure lead to the theory of exon shu*ing, first proposed by Gilbert in 1978 <ref> [14] </ref>. This theory posits that exons represent functionally and/or structurally important subunits of proteins, that introns occur at the boundaries of these modules and that proteins share and reuse the modules that exons encode.

Reference-contexts: As a result, lysozymes in cows and colobine monkeys exhibit amino acid substitutions not found in other species, suggesting, wrongly, that the two species are closely related. This would result in the wrong tree for those residues. Tetraloops in rRNA provide another example of convergent evolution <ref> [16, 41] </ref>. Tetraloops are strings of six bases that form loops at the end of helices in rRNA structures. The two end bases bond, allowing the internal four bases to form a loop. Although there are 256 possible inner loop sequences, only a small number actually occur in nature.

Reference-contexts: Approximation algorithms for both SP and tree alignment include those in [4, 15, 25, 26]. Notably, a polynomial time approximation scheme, yielding a (1+*)-approximation for arbitrarily small *; has been presented by Jiang, Lawler and Wang <ref> [18] </ref> for tree alignment on a fixed topology. - 5 - 3 Evaluating Tree Alignment as a Model for MSA There is an unstated assumption that tree alignment is the gold standard, the ideal cost function, for multiple sequence alignment because the residues in each column are thought to be related

Reference-contexts: More recently, evidence has emerged that suggests that selective pressure can vary within each class, even within a single gene or intron <ref> [19, 32] </ref> 4 Approximations and Convergence Since any reasonable cost function for MSA will probably be NP-hard to optimize [36, 40], it is natural for researchers to look for approximation algorithms which find near optimal solutions to the MSA problem.

Reference-contexts: However, structural information has also been used guide the computation of MSA's and to validate them. Some of the earliest work in structure-based alignments was presented by Lesk and Chothia <ref> [20] </ref>, who used superposition of secondary structures to align globin sequences. Today there are two common approaches to structural alignment.

Reference-contexts: This fact has been recognized and exploited by researchers who developed structure-specific substitution matrices for recognizing specific secondary structures and motifs <ref> [21, 23] </ref>. Additional variations in selective pressure occur at the DNA level. In protein coding regions, substitutions can be non-synonymous (resulting in an amino acid substitution in the protein coded for) or synonymous (resulting in a different codon for the same amino acid).

Reference-contexts: This is another example of the observation, also made by McClure, Vasi and Fitch [22],that MSA's are very sensitive to sequence choice. Phe 223 is thought to play an indirect role in enzyme activity, interacting with His 34 , within the active site <ref> [27] </ref>. The residue that plays this stabilizing role may have changed over time: a residue in a different position may provide this stabilizing effect in certain taxa (e.g. kinetoplastid parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma) [28].

Reference-contexts: The residue that plays this stabilizing role may have changed over time: a residue in a different position may provide this stabilizing effect in certain taxa (e.g. kinetoplastid parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma) <ref> [28] </ref>. In this scenario, a random mutation allows a previously inactive residue to take on the functional role played by Phe 223 .

Realignment using sequences from the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii indicated that Phe 223 is more likely homologous to a portion of the fi-sheet which comprises the enzyme backbone <ref> [29] </ref>. The T. gondii sequence thus provided additional information that suggested an alternative alignment. Other protozoan sequences in the - 6 - alignment have substantial, and different, nucleotide biases 4 . The T. gondii gene, which has relatively equal nucleotide distribution links the other protozoan sequences, facilitating alignment. <p> Consistency Biological wisdom holds that MSA computation should get easier as more sequences are introduced, and harder as the sequences get longer.

Reference-contexts: The first evidence that the same exons appear in more than one gene was found in the human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene <ref> [35, 34] </ref>. The LDL receptor gene was shown to share exons with genes for epidermal growth factor, blood clotting factor IX and complementation factor C9. Since then, many such "mosaic" genes have been discovered (see [11] for a survey).

Reference-contexts: This type of structural alignment is often done manually. Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see <ref> [38, 39] </ref>, for an example). Structural and functional information has been used to validate multiple sequence alignments.

Reference-contexts: As a result, lysozymes in cows and colobine monkeys exhibit amino acid substitutions not found in other species, suggesting, wrongly, that the two species are closely related. This would result in the wrong tree for those residues. Tetraloops in rRNA provide another example of convergent evolution <ref> [16, 41] </ref>. Tetraloops are strings of six bases that form loops at the end of helices in rRNA structures. The two end bases bond, allowing the internal four bases to form a loop. Although there are 256 possible inner loop sequences, only a small number actually occur in nature.
