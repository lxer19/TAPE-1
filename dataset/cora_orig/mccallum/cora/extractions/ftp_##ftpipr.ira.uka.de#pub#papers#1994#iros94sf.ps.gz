Abstract: In this paper, we present a new control system for the intelligent force control of multifingered robot grips. The multilevel system architecture combines both fuzzy-based adaptation level and a neural-based one with a conventional PID-controller that allows autonomous performing fine manipulations of an object. Two various kinds of fuzzy controllers will be presented. They use a decision making logic which expresses the a-priory knowledge about the grasp force behaviour inside the friction cones and the necessary reactions regarding the criterion for grip stability. A neural controller, based on a Hooke-Jeeves optimisation approach, has been developed as well. The neural control algorithm is implemented by a three-layered backpropagation neural network. The neural and fuzzy controllers can be used separately or parallel. In the last case the neural controller can be online trained using the input-output information from the fuzzy one. A computer based simulation system for the peg-in-hole insertion task is developed to analyse and to compare the capabilities of both control algorithms. The demands of flexibility and real-time control of the implementation of the control system are suited by a tailorable parallel computer concept. The two basic ideas of the concept are to set up each processing element individually for its application and connect these elements with different communica-tional methods accordingly to the applicational demands. As this happens before runtime the concept is called static flexibility and is implemented using a new mechanical computer structure.
