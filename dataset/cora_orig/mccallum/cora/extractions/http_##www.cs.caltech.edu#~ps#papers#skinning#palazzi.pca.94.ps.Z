Abstract: Discretized representations of deformable objects, based upon simple dynamic point-mass systems, rely upon the propagation of forces between neighbouring elements to produce a global change in the shape of the surface. Attempting to make such a surface rigid produces stiff equations that are costly to evaluate with any numerical stability. This paper introduces a new multilevel approach for controlling the response of a deformable object to external forces. The user specifies the amount of flexibility or stiffness of the surface by controlling how the applied forces propagate through the levels of a multi-resolution representation of the object. A wide range of surface be-haviour is possible, and rigid motion is attained without resort to special numerical methods. This technique is applied to the displacement constraints method of Gas-cuel and Gascuel [5] to provide explicit graduated control of the response of a deformable object to imposed forces.

Reference-contexts: In 1988, Platt and Barr [11] use mathematical constraint methods based on physical constraints and optimization theory to model and animate constrained flexible solids. The reaction constraints guide a flexible solid along a path and prevent these solids from penetrating other polygonal objects. Baraff and Witkin <ref> [1] </ref> present a dynamic model for flexible bodies where deformations take the form of global deformations of an object's rest shape. Objects are deformed by parametric "space warps" applied to all the points on the object.

Here, the constraint forces are incorporated into the dynamic equations of motion, resulting in a system of coupled differential equations. Another similar approach was presented by van Overveld [18]. As in <ref> [2] </ref>, and also with displacement constraints, rigid objects are connected together by geometric constraints to form a more complex object. This work differs from [2] in that it makes the assumption that the constraint forces and the external forces may be uncoupled. <p> Another similar approach was presented by van Overveld [18].

Reference-contexts: To distinguish our method from the multigrid method, we will refer to ours as a multilevel method. In the basic multigrid method <ref> [3] </ref>, an initial value problem over a rectilinear mesh is solved by decomposing the mesh into several levels of decreasing resolution. This process is called restriction and is shown in Figure 3. <p> The positions and orientations for the segments in level k, are obtained directly from the next finer level k+1 level to enforce rigidity using the injection method <ref> [3] </ref>. The endpoints of a segment in level k are assigned the values of the corresponding mesh points of level k + 1 and these two endpoints define the segment's orientation. <p> However, this is not the case if linear interpolation, one of the standard prolongation operators in multigrid formulations <ref> [3] </ref>, is used. The difficulty arises when a mesh point in level k+1 lies between two mesh points in level k. Figure 7 illustrates this problem. Point p1 in level k + 1 lies between points p2 and p3 in the lower resolution surface at level k.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate this situation we employ the reference plus offset form developed in <ref> [4] </ref> to represent the surface at each level. In this formulation the position of p1 is coded as an offset vector, h, from the midpoint of segment p2p3 (note that this will not always be a right angle).

Reference-contexts: The goal of our work is to develop a system specifically targeted for animators where speed and control are the essential elements of any dynamic model of deformation, and not physical validity. For the local model of surface deformation we will use a technique introduced by Gascuel and Gascuel <ref> [5] </ref> called "displacement constraints". This approach uncouples the constraints connecting components of the surface (in this case line segments) from the effects of any external forces. First, the dynamic behaviour of each component is determined based upon the physical properties of the component and the laws of rigid body dynamics. <p> Displacement constraints also makes this assumption, but the manner in which the constraints are satisfied is quite different. 3 Displacement Constraints Displacement constraints (DC) is a technique introduced by Gascuel and Gascuel <ref> [5] </ref> to provide deformables surfaces for use in the animation of articulated figures. DC uses a simplified dynamic modeling technique that, although using a very simplified model of physics, attempts to preserve first order linear momentum.
