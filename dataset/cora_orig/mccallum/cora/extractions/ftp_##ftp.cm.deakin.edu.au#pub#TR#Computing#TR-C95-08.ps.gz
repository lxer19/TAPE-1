Title: Automatic Identification of Parallel Units and Synchronisation Points in Programs

Abstract: In this report we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically identify units of programs written in procedural languages and to execute these units in parallel on a distributed system. The target programs are the general programming problems that arise rather than being restricted to a specific domain. This is achieved by automatically identifying units of parallelism based upon the basic block at the assembly language level. The parallel units are then organised into sequences that are either independent of the ow of the program or dependent upon other sequences. Synchronisation points for the parallel units are identified based on the dependent sequences. The implementation of this methodology by using the compiler and the interactions at the compiler/operating system interface is discussed. The report concludes by summarising the major issues in implementing such a method including the responsibilities for actions in a distributed environment followed by proposed future development. An appendix with examples of program transformations under the proposed methodology is included.
