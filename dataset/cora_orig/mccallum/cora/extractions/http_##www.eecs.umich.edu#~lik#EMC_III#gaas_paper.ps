Abstract: Nondestructive optical techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry or reflectometry provide information about a material's thickness and optical properties. These methods do not interfere with most semiconductor processes, and are currently being used as in situ monitors in many growth, deposition, and etch chambers. With appropriate feedback algorithms, they can also be used for real-time control of semiconductor processing. To be used effectively in these applications, appropriate models must be created for the complex dielectric function versus wavelength and material properties. One property often overlooked in the modeling of a semiconductor's dielectric function is the dependence on temperature of the sample. For ex situ measurements, from which most models are constructed, this is not usually considered to be an issue. For in situ growth applications, it is crucial that models correctly account for the temperature in order to obtain accurate thickness and composition information. In this work, we discuss a temperature-dependent model for the complex dielectric function for GaAs valid for the temperature range 31 ffi C T 634 ffi C. We describe our model, which is an extension of the critical point parabolic band method. This is a phenomenological method which is
