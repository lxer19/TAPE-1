Title: Moving Right Along: A Computational Model of Metaphoric Reasoning about Events  
Author: Srini Narayanan 
Address: 1947 Center Street Suite 600, Berkeley CA 94704 USA  
Affiliation: International Computer Science Institute and University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract: This paper describes the results of an implemented computational model that cashes out the belief that metaphor interpretation is grounded in embodied primitives. The specific task addressed is the interpretation of simple causal narratives in the domains of Politics and Economics. The stories are taken from newspaper articles in these domains. When presented with a pre-parsed version of these narratives as input, the system described is able to generate commonsense inferences consistent with the input.

Reference-contexts: However, in our experiments, we found that embodied motion and manipulation terms may in fact be compactly coding for these features as well. Note that this assertion is quite different from <ref> (Carbonell 1982) </ref> who hypothesized that entire strategies and plans (proof trees) ware invariantly transferred. In our theory, it is the key-event such as the thwarting of a goal, or the absence or production of a needed resource, etc. that is asserted using embodied terms.

Reference-contexts: Our model of the target domain consists of multiple copies (up to 4 ) of a temporally extended Belief net <ref> (Dean & Wellman 1991) </ref>, representing different time slices. The structure of the target domain for three temporal slices of the Belief network is shown in Figure 3. Within a single temporal slice, the nodes of the network correspond to economic variables which can take on different values.

Reference-contexts: Third, while most approaches require extra resources to process novel expressions, our approach explains why some novel expressions can be processed with no additional resources (consistent with psychological observations <ref> (Gibbs 1994) </ref>). Fourth, our approach is quite unique in being able to exploit implicit evaluative information and speaker intent which we believe is often the reason to choose embodied expressions in the first place.

Reference-contexts: Fourth, our approach is quite unique in being able to exploit implicit evaluative information and speaker intent which we believe is often the reason to choose embodied expressions in the first place. Finally, evidence from a recent study by Joe Grady <ref> (Grady 1997) </ref>, suggests that complex metaphoric maps are composed from simple experiential correlations, consistent with the work reported here. Conclusion This paper outlined an implemented computational model for interpreting simple narratives such as newspaper story fragments and headlines involving political or economic causation.

Reference-contexts: These values are default values and are often overridden by specific assertions as we will soon see in detail in the next section. From such local conditional probability tables, Belief Update algorithms <ref> (Jensen 1996) </ref> compute the global posterior probabilities for the entire network propagating influences backward and forward in time. Metaphor maps In our model, metaphor maps connect the x-schema based representations to the belief network representing knowledge about international economics.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 shows the projection of "stumbling" onto the target domain. We will return to this example in the next section. Our model currently includes three different types of embodied maps. One type of map corresponds to ontological maps <ref> (Lakoff & Johnson 1980) </ref> which map entities and objects between embodied and abstract domains. Such maps are called omaps. In general, one central function of omaps is to map the fillers of various case-roles of an event phrase across domains.

Reference-contexts: Our model is based on results in sensory-motor control (Pearson 1993; Bernstein, 1967) and linguistic research in Cognitive Semantics. Formally, the computational model is an extension to Stochastic Petri Nets <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. A Petri net is a bipartite graph containing places (drawn as circles) and transitions (rectangles). Places hold tokens and represent predicates about the world state or internal state. Transitions are the active component.
