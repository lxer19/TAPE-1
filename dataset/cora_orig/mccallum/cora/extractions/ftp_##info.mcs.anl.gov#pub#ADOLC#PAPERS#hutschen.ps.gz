Title: Chapter 29 A New Method for Bevel Gear Tooth Flank Computation  
Author: Ulf Hutschenreiter 
Keyword: Spiral bevel gears, hypoid gears, tooth flank computation, undercutting, edge of regression, envelope condition, derivative tensors, higher order differentiation, cusp singularities.  
Abstract: The use of automatic differentiation for an exact computation of geometric properties of bevel gear tooth flanks is discussed. Known models of the kinematics of the machine tools generating bevel gear tooth flanks have been improved. Using that result, we compute curvature properties of the generated envelope surfaces directly. From an analytical point of view, the envelope condition used in differential geometry can be interpreted as a singularity of a vector function in 3-space. By an analytical characterization of this singularity we obtain a two-dimensional parameterization of the generated flank for any machine parameter set. The necessary partial derivatives of the vector function are computed with the help of automatic differentiation. For the first time it is possible to compute the curvature properties and the resulting undercut geometry between tooth and fillet surface of the tooth flanks of any spiral bevel or hypoid gear without any approximation.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the resulting tooth flank is equivalent to the envelope of the family of these surfaces. From differential geometry, we know that this envelope has to satisfy the envelope condition i j where (:; :; :) describes the scalar triple product of three vectors. Traditionally, analytical methods <ref> [Baer1972a] </ref> have been used to get an explicit equation r = r (u; v) of the envelope. Cases are preferred where all surfaces of the family have the same shape, and a congruent displacement can be found mapping one surface to another [Litvin1995a]. <p> computed even if no explicit solution t (u; v) is available, we can get a two-dimensional parameterization of the envelope of the surface family (7) in the form r (u; v) := F (u; v; t (u; v)):(11) 6 Hutschenreiter 2.4 Determination of the Curvature Properties Based on results in <ref> [Baer1972a] </ref>, we can give the formulas for the computation of the curvature properties of an envelope r. Use of these formulas not only assumes the computability of the function t = t (u; v) but also assumes the computability of the partial derivative of that function.

Reference-contexts: This method is applicable for any settings of the machine tool but requires a large effort for computing every point on the tooth flank. The second method is based on an explicit solution of the law of gearing [Wildgrube1984a] or the envelope condition <ref> [Baer1991a] </ref>, [Dutschk1994a], [Litvin1969a], [Litvin1994a] for special machine tool settings.

Reference-contexts: Both characterizations result in implicit equations describing the tooth flanks, which can be analyzed by two main approaches. The first method, mainly represented by [Weck1987a], solves the meshing equations by numerical iteration. As many points as possible are computed on the tooth flank <ref> [Baxter1973a] </ref>, [Guzman1978a], [Schriefer1983a], [Stadtfeld1993a]. This method is applicable for any settings of the machine tool but requires a large effort for computing every point on the tooth flank.

Reference-contexts: Thus, both the principal curvature values 1 and 2 and the principal curvature directions can be obtained. Using Euler's theorem on curvature in surface theory and Meusnier's theorem <ref> [Blaschke1924a] </ref>, we can compute the normal curvature of any spatial curve lying on the envelope at any point of the envelope surface.

The second method is based on an explicit solution of the law of gearing [Wildgrube1984a] or the envelope condition [Baer1991a], <ref> [Dutschk1994a] </ref>, [Litvin1969a], [Litvin1994a] for special machine tool settings. <p> Instead, they need to be converted into grids with parameters stemming from the gear wheel geometry. Because the effort for computing single points on such grids is high, different approximation methods have been used, for example, straight lines [Guzman1978a], splines [Schriefer1983a], [Stadtfeld1993a], or Bezier surfaces <ref> [Dutschk1994a] </ref>. All further investigations (contact properties, transmission errors, curvature properties, tooth strength analysis, etc.) are then based on these approximations. The method proposed here is also based on a general model of a bevel gear-generating machine tool. <p> When we used spherical blades in our experiments, as in Figure 2, we found (in agreement with other authors, e.g., <ref> [Dutschk1994a] </ref>) that whenever undercut occurred, a pair of singularities could be observed. One singularity was on that part of the envelope generated by the blade segment itself, and the other on the part of the envelope generated by the point separating the two curve segments. <p> That means d attaches only the singularity set, and thus generates another new singularity on the image of the singularity set, which occurs on the envelope originally studied for singularities. The results obtained with this approach are in accordance with the necessary undercut condition proposed in <ref> [Dutschk1994a] </ref>. The method for determining undercut, as proposed in [Dutschk1994a], is not very satisfactory, especially for an effective implementation, but an exact proof of the correctness of the new approach (28) still is 12 Hutschenreiter Fig. 4. <p> The results obtained with this approach are in accordance with the necessary undercut condition proposed in <ref> [Dutschk1994a] </ref>.

First, one can theoretically obtain directional derivatives of arbitrarily high order.

Reference-contexts: 0:(28) This approach is motivated by the fact that if Equation (28) is satisfied, the vector d of the domain of arguments that satisfies the equation (19) (and thus is a zero vector of F 0 whenever g vanishes) is orthogonal to the gradient g 0 of the singularity set <ref> [Schuster1996a] </ref>. That means d attaches only the singularity set, and thus generates another new singularity on the image of the singularity set, which occurs on the envelope originally studied for singularities. The results obtained with this approach are in accordance with the necessary undercut condition proposed in [Dutschk1994a].
