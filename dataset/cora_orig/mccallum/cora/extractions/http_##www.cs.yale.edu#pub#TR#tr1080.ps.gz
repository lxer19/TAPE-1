Reference-contexts: A relativized converse is hinted at by several oracle constructions involving counting classes (e.g., <ref> [1, 3, 2] </ref>) that hinge on the nonexistence of such polynomials. However, an exact characterization of the univariate functions that are relativizable closure properties of #P was unknown until Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner [6] proved that they are exactly the positive linear combinations of binomial coefficients. <p> We note that this characterization is not surprising because many oracle constructions for counting classes hinge on the nonexistence of polynomials of this type (for example, <ref> [1, 3, 2] </ref>). Theorem 4 ([6]). Let f be a function from N to N.
