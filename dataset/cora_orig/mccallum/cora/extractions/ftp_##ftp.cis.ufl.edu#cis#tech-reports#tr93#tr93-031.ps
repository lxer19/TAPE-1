Abstract: Shape modeling is an important constituent of computer vision as well as computer graphics research. Shape models aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. This paper presents a new approach to shape modeling which retains the most attractive features of existing methods, and overcomes their prominent limitations. Our technique can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made. A single instance of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. This method is based on the ideas developed by Osher & Sethian to model propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. It is moved by solving a "Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed term synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of the object boundaries. The resulting equation of motion is solved by employing entropy-satisfying upwind finite difference schemes. We also introduce a new algorithm for rapid advancement of the front using what we call a narrow-band updation scheme. This leads to significant improvement in the time complexity of the shape recovery procedure. An added advantage of our modeling scheme is that it can easily be extended to any number of space dimensions. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on low contrast medical images.

Reference-contexts: Since the narrow-band update strategy involves only a fraction of the total number of points, a significant saving in time is realized, making our method a very attractive alternative to other shape recovery schemes. A complete discussion of the narrow-band techniques for interface propagation may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. In summary, we present a novel scheme for shape modeling which can be used in both computer vision and computer graphics applications. Given the reconstructed shape, our approach can also be extended to decipher the constituent part structure for high-level processing.

Reference-contexts: The characters "A" and "B" in the figure (14) are examples of shapes with holes. Recovery of hand-written character shapes finds application in the area of character recognition.

Reference-contexts: In the problem area of automatic segmentation of noisy images, snakes perform poorly unless they are placed close to the preferred shapes. In a move to make the final result relatively insensitive to the initial conditions, Cohen <ref> [6] </ref> defines an inflation force on the active contour. This force makes the model behave like an inflating balloon. <p> The term F A , referred to as the advection term, is independent of the moving front's geometry. The front uniformly expands or contracts with speed F A depending on its sign and is analogous to the inflation force defined in <ref> [6] </ref>. The second term F G , is the part which depends on the geometry of the front, such as its local curvature. <p> In this experiment we compare the performance of our scheme with the active contour model to bring the limitations of the later into focus. We first attempt to reconstruct the complex arterial structure using a snake model with inflation forces <ref> [6] </ref>. In figures 10 (a) through 10 (i), we show a sequence of pictures depicting the snake configuration in the image.

However, the aforementioned schemes for shape modeling have two serious limitations the dependence of the final surface shape on the initial guess made to start the numerical reconstruction procedure, and an assumption that the object is of a known topology.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if F G 6= 0, the level sets will violate the property that they are a constant distance away from each other. However, they will never collide and cross each other if the speed function F = F A + F G is continuous (see <ref> [8] </ref>).

However, the aforementioned schemes for shape modeling have two serious limitations the dependence of the final surface shape on the initial guess made to start the numerical reconstruction procedure, and an assumption that the object is of a known topology. <p> Our method can also recover shapes whose topology changes over time, e.g., the cell boundary in cell division. The framework of energy minimization has also been used successfully in the past for extracting salient image contours edges and lines. Kass et al. <ref> [10] </ref> used energy-minimizing "snakes" that exhibit an affinity toward image features such as edge points and edge segments, while maintaining piecewise smoothness. The weights of the smoothness and image terms in the energy functional can be adjusted for different kinds of behavior. <p> This (diffusion) term smooths out the high curvature regions of the front and has the same regularizing effect on the front as the internal deformation energy term in thin-plate-membrane splines <ref> [10] </ref> (see the figure (9)). We rewrite equation (6) by splitting the influence of F as t + F A j r j +F G j r j= 0: (7) First consider the case when the front moves with a constant speed, i.e. F = F A . <p> Clearly, with every increment in the value of ", the level set f = 0g attains a configuration that is relatively smoother. This is analogous to the controlled-continuity provided by thin-plate-membrane splines <ref> [26, 10] </ref>. In our third experiment we recover the complicated structure of an arterial tree. The real image has been obtained by clipping a portion of a digital subtraction angiogram. This is an example of a shape with extended branches or significant protrusions.

This leads to a hierarchical description of a shape which is suitable for its recognition.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we propose a dynamic shape modeling method that will start with a single instance of the model and will automatically "sprout" branches during the evolutionary process. Once the shape has been segmented from the image, its constituent part structure may be inferred using the algorithm described in <ref> [12] </ref>. Most existing surface modeling techniques require that the topology of the object be known before the shape recovery can commence. However, it is not always possible to specify the topology of an object prior to its recovery. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in [19, 23, 24], has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. This leads to a hierarchical description of a shape which is suitable for its recognition. <p> In other words, they show that by evolving a known shape boundary, explicit clues can be derived towards the goal of developing a hierarchical shape description. In contrast, we start with an arbitrary function and recover complex shapes by propagating it along its gradient field. Shape characterization, as in <ref> [12] </ref>, can be achieved once the object shape is extracted. An important contribution of this paper over our previous work in [17] is the design and implementation of a faster numerical technique for solving the governing equation.

Reference-contexts: This method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher & Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref> to model propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds. Two such examples are flame propagation and crystal growth, in which the speed of the moving interface normal to itself depends on transport terms modified by the local curvature. <p> Sethian [23] has shown that direct parameterization of the moving front may be unstable since it relies on local properties of the solution. In contrast, a method which preserves the global properties of the motion is sought. Osher and Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref> achieve this by viewing the propagating surface as a specific level set of a higher-dimensional function. The equation of motion for this function is reminiscent of an initial valued Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a parabolic right-hand side and is closely related to a viscous hyperbolic conservation law. <p> Following the above level set approach, this hypersurface is then made to flow along its gradient field with a speed F (K), where K is the curvature of the hypersurface. As in <ref> [19] </ref>, we adopt a global approach and view the (N 1) dimensional moving surface as a level set of a time-dependent function of N space dimensions. The equations of motion written for this higher dimensional function are then amenable to stable entropy-satisfying numerical schemes designed to approximate hyperbolic conservation laws. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in <ref> [19, 23, 24] </ref>, has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. [11, 12], who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. <p> We close with a discussion of advantages of our approach and direction of future research in section 6. 2 Front propagation problem In this section we present the level set technique due to Osher and Sethian <ref> [19] </ref>. For details and an expository review, see Sethian [24]. <p> Third, topological changes are difficult to manage as the evolving interface breaks and merges. And fourth, significant bookkeeping problems occur in the extension of this technique to three dimensions. As an alternative, the central idea in the level set approach of Osher and Sethian <ref> [19] </ref> is to represent the front fl (t) as the level set f = 0g of a function . To motivate this approach, we consider the example of an expanding circle. Suppose the initial front fl at t = 0 is a circle in the xy-plane (figure 2 (a)). <p> The gradient r (x; t) is normal to the (N 1) dimensional level set passing through x. Now, we derive the equation of motion for function . 8 Consider the motion of some level set f = Cg. Following the derivation in <ref> [19] </ref>, let x (t) be the trajectory of a particle located on this level set, so (x (t); t) = C: (1) The particle speed @x=@t in the direction n normal to fl (t) is given by the speed function F . <p> 2 R 2 , the curvature is given by K = x 2 x y xy + xx 2 ( 2 y ) 3=2 : (5) This approach can also be easily extended to higher dimensions and appropriate expressions can be obtained for the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature <ref> [19] </ref>. By substituting F (K) = 1 "K as a typical speed function in equation (4), the equation of motion becomes t + j r j= "K j r j : (6) Equation (6) resembles a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with viscosity, where "viscosity" refers to the second-order parabolic right-hand side. <p> This equation can be solved using the stable, entropy-satisfying finite difference schemes, borrowed from the literature on hyperbolic conservation laws (see <ref> [19] </ref>). 3 Shape recovery with front propagation In this section, we describe how the level set formulation for the front propagation problem discussed in the previous section can be used for shape recovery. There is a fundamental difference between the problems of front propagation and shape recovery. <p> For complete details of the following scheme, we refer the reader to Osher & Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref>. 13 The equation (6) poses an initial valued problem. It is rewritten here as t + ( 2 y ) 1=2 = "r r with (x; y; t = 0) = distance from (x; y) to fl (0). <p> Thus, approximations to the spatial derivative are sought that do not artificially smooth sharp corners and which pick out the correct entropy solution when singularities develop. The schemes given in <ref> [19, 24] </ref> are motivated by the fact that the entropy condition for propagating fronts is identical to the one for hyperbolic conservation laws, where stable, consistent, entropy-satisfying algorithms have a rich history. First, consider the one-dimensional version of the level set equation, with constant normal velocity F A = 1. <p> In the special case where H (u) may be written as a function of u 2 , i.e., H (u) = f (u 2 ) for some function f , one can use the Hamilton-Jacobi flux function given in <ref> [19] </ref>: g (u i1=2 ; u i+1=2 ) = g (D x i ) x ; 0)) 2 + (min (D + This conservative monotone scheme is upwind method in that it differences in the direction of propagating characteristics. <p> The above discussion can be extended to problems in more than one space dimension (see Osher & Sethian <ref> [19] </ref>). Recall that the original intent was to solve equations (9) and (11). <p> Our approach while retaining the desirable features of existing methods for shape modeling, overcomes most of their deficiencies. We adopt the level set techniques first introduced in Osher & Sethian <ref> [19] </ref> to the problem of shape recovery. With this approach, complex shapes can be recovered from images. Unlike the variational formulations for shape recovery which rely on energy minimization, the final result 27 in our method is completely independent of the initial state.

In the context of static problems, more recently, particle systems have been used to model surfaces of arbitrary topology [25]. Smoothness and continuity constraints are imposed by subjecting the particle system to interaction potentials which locally prefer planar or spherical arrangement.

Reference-contexts: The challenge in these problems is to devise numerical schemes for the equations of the propagating front which will accurately approximate these highly unstable physical phenomena. Sethian <ref> [23] </ref> has shown that direct parameterization of the moving front may be unstable since it relies on local properties of the solution. In contrast, a method which preserves the global properties of the motion is sought. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in <ref> [19, 23, 24] </ref>, has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. [11, 12], who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. <p> These discrete markers are updated in time by approximating the spatial derivatives in the equations of motion, and advancing their positions. However, there are several problems with this approach, as discussed in Sethian <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> It is rewritten here as t + ( 2 y ) 1=2 = "r r with (x; y; t = 0) = distance from (x; y) to fl (0). As shown in Sethian <ref> [23] </ref>, for " &gt; 0, the parabolic right-hand side diffuses sharp gradients and forces to stay smooth at all values of t. For " = 0, the boundary moves with unit speed, and a corner must develop from smooth initial data. <p> Of all such weak solutions, one is interested in the one that is the limit of smooth solutions as " ! 0. This particular weak solution can be selected with the help of a so-called "entropy condition", see <ref> [23] </ref>: If the front is viewed as a burning flame, then once a particle is burnt it stays burnt. Thus, approximations to the spatial derivative are sought that do not artificially smooth sharp corners and which pick out the correct entropy solution when singularities develop.

Reference-contexts: This method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher & Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref> to model propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds. Two such examples are flame propagation and crystal growth, in which the speed of the moving interface normal to itself depends on transport terms modified by the local curvature. <p> Sethian [23] has shown that direct parameterization of the moving front may be unstable since it relies on local properties of the solution. In contrast, a method which preserves the global properties of the motion is sought. Osher and Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref> achieve this by viewing the propagating surface as a specific level set of a higher-dimensional function. The equation of motion for this function is reminiscent of an initial valued Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a parabolic right-hand side and is closely related to a viscous hyperbolic conservation law. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in <ref> [19, 23, 24] </ref>, has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. [11, 12], who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. <p> We close with a discussion of advantages of our approach and direction of future research in section 6. 2 Front propagation problem In this section we present the level set technique due to Osher and Sethian [19]. For details and an expository review, see Sethian <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> Moreover, the equations of motion can be solved on a uniform mesh and the level sets can be moved without their explicit construction. 4 Numerical solution In this section, almost without a change, we present the arguments discussed in Sethian <ref> [24] </ref>. For complete details of the following scheme, we refer the reader to Osher & Sethian [19, 24]. 13 The equation (6) poses an initial valued problem. <p> For complete details of the following scheme, we refer the reader to Osher & Sethian <ref> [19, 24] </ref>. 13 The equation (6) poses an initial valued problem. It is rewritten here as t + ( 2 y ) 1=2 = "r r with (x; y; t = 0) = distance from (x; y) to fl (0). <p> Thus, approximations to the spatial derivative are sought that do not artificially smooth sharp corners and which pick out the correct entropy solution when singularities develop. The schemes given in <ref> [19, 24] </ref> are motivated by the fact that the entropy condition for propagating fronts is identical to the one for hyperbolic conservation laws, where stable, consistent, entropy-satisfying algorithms have a rich history. First, consider the one-dimensional version of the level set equation, with constant normal velocity F A = 1.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic criterion for splitting and merging of curves in 2D which is based on monitoring deformation energies of points on the elastic 4 curve has been discussed in [20]. In the context of static problems, more recently, particle systems have been used to model surfaces of arbitrary topology <ref> [25] </ref>. Smoothness and continuity constraints are imposed by subjecting the particle system to interaction potentials which locally prefer planar or spherical arrangement. Particles can be added and deleted dynamically to enlarge and trim the surface respectively, while the system dynamics strive continually to organize the particles into smooth shapes.

Reference-contexts: To this end, several variational shape reconstruction methods have been proposed and there is abundant literature on the same [2, 22, 28, 3, 29, 14]. Generalized spline models with continuity constraints are well suited for fulfilling the goals of shape recovery (see <ref> [3, 4, 26] </ref>). Generalized splines are the key ingredient of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm introduced by Terzopoulos et al., [27]. Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling enables the creation of realistic animation in computer graphics applications and for tracking moving objects in computer vision. <p> Clearly, with every increment in the value of ", the level set f = 0g attains a configuration that is relatively smoother. This is analogous to the controlled-continuity provided by thin-plate-membrane splines <ref> [26, 10] </ref>. In our third experiment we recover the complicated structure of an arterial tree. The real image has been obtained by clipping a portion of a digital subtraction angiogram. This is an example of a shape with extended branches or significant protrusions.

Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling enables the creation of realistic animation in computer graphics applications and for tracking moving objects in computer vision. <p> The weights of the smoothness and image terms in the energy functional can be adjusted for different kinds of behavior. Snakes, also referred to as active contour models, are restricted examples of the more general techniques of matching deformable surface models to image data by means of energy minimization <ref> [27] </ref>. In this modeling scheme, one seeks to design energy functionals whose local minima comprise the set of alternative solutions available to high-level processes. In the absence of a well-developed high-level mechanism to make a choice among these solutions, an interactive approach is used to explore the alternatives. <p> The merits of such an approach are suspect since it is not always possible to derive criteria upon which to base the adaptation algorithm. So the problem is one of accurately modeling bifurcations and protrusions in complex structures. In <ref> [27] </ref> it has been shown that multiple instances of deformable models are required to handle shapes with several distinct parts. This can be very cumbersome, for it involves excessive user interaction and presumes that the shape has already been segmented into its constituent parts.
