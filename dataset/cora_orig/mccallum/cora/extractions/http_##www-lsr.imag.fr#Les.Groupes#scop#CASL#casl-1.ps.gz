Note: Summary Version 1.0 DRAFT CoFI Document: CASL/Summary-v1.0-DRAFT Version: 1.0 DRAFT  E-mail address for comments: cofi-language@brics.dk CoFI: The Common Framework Initiative  This document is available on WWW and by FTP The formatted body 1 and appendices 2 of this document are also available separately. [CHANGED:] The various changes from version 0.99 of the Casl design have been proposed and discussed on the CoFI Language Design mailing list (see the archives 3 All significant changes from version 0.99 of the Summary 4 are marked 5 in the same way as these paragraphs, and listed starting on page xi. Any complaints about changes that have (or have not) been made in this draft should be sent to the mailing list as soon as possible, by 15 October 1998 at the latest! http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/Summary-v1.0-DRAFT/ ftp://ftp.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/Summary-v1.0-DRAFT/ 1 ftp://ftp.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/SemanticsSummary-v1.0 DRAFT/ 2 ftp://ftp.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/SyntaxSummary-v1.0 DRAFT/ 3 http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/MailingLists/cofi-language/98/maillist.html 4 http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI/Documents/CASL/Summary-v0.99 5 These marks are of course temporary, and to be removed in the final version of this document.

Reference-contexts: CoFI Note S-6 [CoF97f] provided a completed draft semantics for this version. Version 0.97 was reviewed by IFIP WG1.3 [IFI97], resulting in tentative approval of the design. Version 0.98 showed just which bits of Casl were subject to reconsideration, in view of the referees' comments <ref> [CoF97a] </ref> and the recommendations made by the CoFI Semantics Task Group [CoF97f]. [CHANGED:] Version 0.99 summarized what was almost the final Casl Design, now also incorporating concrete syntax (the syntax of views and architectural specifications was, however, still somewhat tentative). <p> It also incorporates a significant revision of the treatment of views, following discussions on the mailing list. [] The preliminary response by the Language Design task group to the IFIP WG1.3 referees <ref> [CoF97a] </ref> is now to be expanded to clarify the extent to which the referees' recommendations have been followed.

Reference-contexts: It is intended for readers who are already familiar with the main concepts of algebraic specification. In general, it does not attempt to motivate the design choices that have been taken; a rationale for the design is provided separately <ref> [CoF97b] </ref>. Structure [DELETED] Part I (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4) deals with basic specifications|first many-sorted, then subsorted. Part II (Chapters 5, 6) provides structured specifications, together with specification definitions, instantiations, and views.
