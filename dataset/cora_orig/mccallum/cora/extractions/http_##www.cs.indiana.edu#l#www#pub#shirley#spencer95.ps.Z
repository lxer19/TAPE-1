Abstract: The physical mechanisms and physiological causes of glare in human vision are reviewed. These mechanisms are scattering in the cornea, lens, and retina, and diffraction in the coherent cell structures on the outer radial areas of the lens. This scattering and diffraction are responsible for the "bloom" and "flare lines" seen around very bright objects. The diffraction effects cause the "lenticular halo". The quantitative models of these glare effects are reviewed, and an algorithm for using these models to add glare effects to digital images is presented. The resulting digital point-spread function is thus psychophysically based and can substantially increase the "perceived" dynamic range of computer simulations containing light sources. Finally, a perceptual test is presented that indicates these added glare effects increase the apparent brightness of light sources in digital images.

Reference-contexts: A camera lens filter that mimics the underlying mechanisms of glare in human vision has recently been developed, and had better results than conventional glare filters for some effects <ref> [1] </ref>. Glare effects can be subdivided into two major components: flare and bloom. Flare is composed of a lenticular halo and a ciliary corona (Figure 2), and is primarily caused by the lens [29]. <p> We need to add these flare lines without disturbing the macroscopic structure suggested by Equations 5, 8, and 9. We add flare detail to our digital filter by drawing random an-tialiased radial lines of random intensity in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on a digital image the same size as our filter. We draw a number of lines to visually match Simpson's observations (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: In fact, current knowledge about the cell structure in the eye comes from inversion of observed scattering behavior <ref> [2, 15] </ref>. For this reason, we use psychophysical and phenomenological results in addition to physical modeling. If the eye is focused on a "point source", then ideally a small discrete area of non-zero irradiance would fall on the retina.

Reference-contexts: Investigations by Stiles [31], Cornsweet and Teller [9], Blackwell and Blackwell <ref> [3] </ref>, Hemenger [15] and others all corroborate that the masking effect of glare is caused primarily by stray light. Direct evidence has also been obtained by observing the interior of the eye, revealing that the light scattering comes primarily from the cornea, crystalline lens, and retina (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: This is not the case, and has been the cause of some debate in the glare literature. The perceived fraction of light scattered in Equation 2 (i.e. R roughly 10% for normal viewers. However, physical experiments suggest that as much as 40% of the light is actually scattered <ref> [26, 4] </ref>. Researchers have investigated this apparent contradiction. The most common explanation is that angular dependence of the sensitivity of the cones in the retina (the Crawford-Stiles effect [36]) effectively absorbs some of the stray light, particularly for more than a few degrees.

Reference-contexts: These cellular structures, many microns in diameter, scatter light independent of wavelength, much like a rough reflecting surface. For the cornea and the lens, the light is scattered in a narrow forward cone with approximately a Gaussian distribution <ref> [5] </ref>. The corneal scattering can be differentiated from the lenticular scattering since it casts a shadow of the iris on the retina. <p> These functions are shown in Figure 7. The function f 0 represents the unscattered component of the light, It shows the typical Gaussian shape expected for an real-world imaging system. This term should vary slightly with pupil size <ref> [5] </ref> but for our purposes could be replaced by a delta function because the angular size of the Gaussian will be much smaller than a pixel width.

Reference-contexts: There is also an age-related color shift toward the yellow in the light transmitted by the lens. This, as well as increased fluorescence of the lens, can cause an additional reduction in visibility for elderly viewers in some viewing conditions such as twilight <ref> [6] </ref> and scotopic conditions [21]. The yellowing of the lens also causes metamerism to vary with age [8].

Reference-contexts: The biconvex lens with the circular optical grating is actually a simplified model of the crystalline lens of the human eye (Figure 5 (b)). This is composed of fibers which are relatively large strips of transparent material having a cross-section of roughly hexagonal shape <ref> [10] </ref>. Although the central part of the lens is optically homogeneous, the exterior portions act as an optical grating with a spacing of e, the width of the fibers.

Reference-contexts: Rays of the ciliary corona appear as radial streaks emanating from the center of the source. Similar ray patterns associated with other coronas have been studied by physicists and are caused by random fluctuations in refractive index of the ocular media <ref> [15] </ref>. The lenticular halo is observed as a set of colored, concentric rings, surrounding the light source and distal to the ciliary corona. The somewhat irregular rings are composed of radial segments, where the color of each segment of the ray varies with its distance from the source. <p> The apparent size of the halo is constant and independent of the distance between the observer and the source. This phenomenon is caused by the radial fibers of the crystalline structure of the lens <ref> [29, 15] </ref>. Bloom, frequently referred to as "veiling luminance" is the "glow" around bright objects. Bloom causes a reduction in contrast that interferes with the visibility of nearby objects, such as the night-time view of the grill between two car headlamps. <p> We conclude the pa-per showing several vivid examples and recommendations for future work. 2 Physiology and Physical Effects The physical mechanisms behind glare have been studied since the late 19th century [29] and have been a matter of debate until quite recently <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section we present the physical origins of glare, drawing mainly on Simpson's work on lenticular haloes [29], and Vos [33] and Hemenger's [15] work on scattering in the eye. 2.1 Lenticular Halo When one observes a point source of light in a dark surround, there appears to be <p> Effects The physical mechanisms behind glare have been studied since the late 19th century [29] and have been a matter of debate until quite recently <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section we present the physical origins of glare, drawing mainly on Simpson's work on lenticular haloes [29], and Vos [33] and Hemenger's [15] work on scattering in the eye. 2.1 Lenticular Halo When one observes a point source of light in a dark surround, there appears to be a series of concentric colored rings around the source. This is known as the lenticular halo (Figure 2). <p> These radial rays may extend beyond the lenticular halo, and are brighter and more pronounced as the angle subtended by the source decreases (Figure 4). The ciliary corona is caused by semi-random density fluctuation in the nucleus of the lens which causes forward scattering that is independent of wavelength <ref> [15] </ref>. As the size of the source increases, it appears that the ciliary corona blurs and contributes to the bloom effect. This is because superimposing the fine flare lines coming from each part of an areal source eliminates the crisp pattern of any given set of radial flare lines. <p> Veiling luminance has been the subject of investigations for almost two centuries, and there is still some controversy surrounding some of the details of the mechanisms for glare. It is evident that the stray or scattered light plays a dominant role <ref> [15] </ref>, but neural inhibitory effects may also be present at very small angles of incidence [33]. <p> Investigations by Stiles [31], Cornsweet and Teller [9], Blackwell and Blackwell [3], Hemenger <ref> [15] </ref> and others all corroborate that the masking effect of glare is caused primarily by stray light. Direct evidence has also been obtained by observing the interior of the eye, revealing that the light scattering comes primarily from the cornea, crystalline lens, and retina (Figure 2). <p> In fact, current knowledge about the cell structure in the eye comes from inversion of observed scattering behavior <ref> [2, 15] </ref>. For this reason, we use psychophysical and phenomenological results in addition to physical modeling. If the eye is focused on a "point source", then ideally a small discrete area of non-zero irradiance would fall on the retina. <p> Recently, Vos has attempted to unify the large number of PSF models for the eye [33]. In this section we review Vos' work, and add two effects studied by Hemenger <ref> [15] </ref> not accounted for in Vos' model. <p> It was observed by Mallero and Palmer [18] that light at 568nm caused a lenticular halo of approximately 3 ffi radius with an angular width of 0:35 ffi . Based on this observation, Hemenger <ref> [15] </ref> used the following empirical formula to model the lenticular halo with these properties produced by light at 568nm: 19:75 ( 0 ) 2 where B is a constant and 0 = 3 ffi .

Reference-contexts: We should expect no lenticular halo in daylight conditions, a mild lenticular halo in dimly lit rooms, and prominent lenticular haloes for dark scenes.

Reference-contexts: To construct the colors in the lenticular halo, f 3 (; ), we process Equation 7 for 50 wavelengths from 400nm to 700nm and then convert to a trichromatic transform as described by Meyer <ref> [19] </ref>. This halo is not a classic "pure" spectrum because each wavelength bleeds into its neighbors, so it is not on the boundary of the visible part of the CIE diagram and is thus easier to display on a monitor gamut.

Reference-contexts: Although these techniques are not psychophysically accurate, each produces the desired impression by exaggerating the luminance of the sources. The idea of adding glare effects to a digital image is not new. Nakamae et al. <ref> [20] </ref> pointed out that the limited dynamic range of CRTs prevents the display of luminaires at their actual luminance values, and that adding streaking and blooming around the luminaires helps give the appearance of glare. <p> This basic strategy has been used by Nakamae et al. <ref> [20] </ref> and Chiu et al. [7]. Unlike these previous approaches, we use different flare filters based on the adaptation state of the viewer. To develop a filter for a particular image, we first construct digital versions of f 0 (), f 1 (), f 2 (), and f 3 ().

Reference-contexts: Bloom is caused by stray light attributed to scatter from three portions of the eye: the cornea, the crystalline lens, and the retina, all with approximately equal contributions <ref> [33] </ref>. The physiology of the eye and the resultant physical effects are explained in greater detail in the following section. <p> In this section we present the physical origins of glare, drawing mainly on Simpson's work on lenticular haloes [29], and Vos <ref> [33] </ref> and Hemenger's [15] work on scattering in the eye. 2.1 Lenticular Halo When one observes a point source of light in a dark surround, there appears to be a series of concentric colored rings around the source. This is known as the lenticular halo (Figure 2). <p> It is evident that the stray or scattered light plays a dominant role [15], but neural inhibitory effects may also be present at very small angles of incidence <ref> [33] </ref>. <p> This same effect causes light transmitted by the outer edge of a fully dilated pupil to be 5-10 times less effective than light through the center of the pupil <ref> [33] </ref>. This implies that we should trust the ten percent figure for our purposes because it is the perceptual quality of the light that we need to account for. Thus, we should realize that Equation 2 represents a normalized perceptual PSF and does not measure the spread of retinal illuminance. <p> Thus, we should realize that Equation 2 represents a normalized perceptual PSF and does not measure the spread of retinal illuminance. Recently, Vos has attempted to unify the large number of PSF models for the eye <ref> [33] </ref>. In this section we review Vos' work, and add two effects studied by Hemenger [15] not accounted for in Vos' model. <p> This means that any weighted average of functions that each satisfy Equation 4 is also a candidate. Vos <ref> [33] </ref> has reviewed the various models for glare and noted that there are three different empirical components in the PSF for an eye. The first is a narrow Gaussian that represents the unscattered component. <p> If there are no cataracts, Vos <ref> [33] </ref> has established a rough age relation: P p () = (0:384 6:9 fi 10 9 A 4 )f 0 () + (0:138 + 6:9 fi 10 9 A 4 )f 2 (); (10) where A is the age of the viewer in years.

Reference-contexts: Since each of these filters must have unit volume, we can calculate each filter proportional to a given function, and then renormalize the filter so that all pixels sum to one. These filters and the images they are applied to are stored in Ward's floating point file format <ref> [35] </ref>, so that the small values in the off-center filter pixels are not lost. We compute the filter for an N fi N image, where N = 2n + 1 so there is guaranteed to be a single central pixel.

Reference-contexts: R roughly 10% for normal viewers. However, physical experiments suggest that as much as 40% of the light is actually scattered [26, 4]. Researchers have investigated this apparent contradiction. The most common explanation is that angular dependence of the sensitivity of the cones in the retina (the Crawford-Stiles effect <ref> [36] </ref>) effectively absorbs some of the stray light, particularly for more than a few degrees. This same effect causes light transmitted by the outer edge of a fully dilated pupil to be 5-10 times less effective than light through the center of the pupil [33]. <p> The pupil diameter is influenced by many factors such as age, mood, and the spectral distribution of incoming light, but it is primarily related to the field luminance of the scene. Moon and Spencer (1944) <ref> [36] </ref> relate average pupil diameter D (in mm) to field luminance L (in cd=m 2 ): D = 4:9 3 tanh (0:4 (log 10 L + 1)) : This yields a pupil diameter of about 3mm for L = 10cd=m 2 , which is the field luminance of a dimly lit <p> The staircase method refers to a method of decreasing the adjustment to a stimulus to converge on a threshold while virtually eliminating predictive bias <ref> [36] </ref>.
