Abstract: Our experience in compiling the Frequently Asked Questions for sci.space represents an example of voluntary cooperation in this new kind of community. A large number of authors contributed to this document; in a sense it represents the accumulated experience of the people who make up the forum. As a social device, the FAQs should help raise the new user to a higher level of sophistication, more able to comprehend and discuss the material covered by the newsgroup. They also prevent repetition of material already familiar to most seasoned users, thereby reducing traffic volume and increasing "signal-to-noise Conceived and created outside the traditional framework of classrooms and teachers, the FAQ list represents a unique educational resource. It offers not merely specific answers, but references to wider information which the motivated person can seek out. It also helps unlock other space-related resources of the network world to neophyte users. We look forward to improving the information in the FAQ files, and to welcoming many new participants as they join our electronic village. We acknowledge Eugene Miya for his efforts in preparing and maintaining early versions of the FAQ list, and for inspiring us and others to undertake the present effort. We thank the co-authors of the list for their invaluable contributions, and for the spirit of generous cooperation which all have exhibited.
