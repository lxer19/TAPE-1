Abstract: After a brief review of the main missions of neutrino telescopes | astronomy and astrophysics, dark matter searches and particle physics | we describe the AMANDA South Pole neutrino detector. With an effective telescope area of order 10 4 m 2 and a threshold of ~50 GeV, it represents the first of a new generation of high energy neutrino detectors, envisaged over 25 years ago. We describe its performance, and map AMANDA's expansion to a detector of kilometer dimension.

Reference-contexts: 1 A New Astronomy High energy neutrino telescopes are multi-purpose instruments; their science mission covers particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics, cosmology and cosmic ray physics. Their deployment creates new opportunities for glaciology and oceanography, possibly geology of the Earth's core <ref> [1] </ref>. I will first introduce high energy neutrino detectors as astronomical telescopes using Fig. 1. The figure shows the diffuse flux of photons as a function of their energy and wavelength, from radio waves to the high energy gamma rays detected with satellite-borne detectors [2].

Reference-contexts: I will first introduce high energy neutrino detectors as astronomical telescopes using Fig. 1. The figure shows the diffuse flux of photons as a function of their energy and wavelength, from radio waves to the high energy gamma rays detected with satellite-borne detectors <ref> [2] </ref>. The data span 19 decades in energy. Major discoveries have been historically associated with the introduction of techniques for exploring new wavelengths. All of the discoveries were surprises; see Table 1.

Reference-contexts: The primary motivation for commissioning neutrino telescopes is to cover the uncharted territory in Fig. 1: wavelengths smaller than 10 14 cm, or energies in excess of 10 GeV. This exploration has already been launched by truly pioneering observations using air Cherenkov telescopes <ref> [3] </ref>. Larger space-based detectors and cosmic ray facilities with sensitivity above 10 7 TeV, an energy where charged protons point back at their sources with minimal deflection by the galactic magnetic field, will be pursuing similar goals.

Reference-contexts: Could the high energy skies in Fig. 1 be empty? No, cosmic rays with energies exceeding 10 8 TeV have been recorded <ref> [4] </ref>. Fig. 1. Flux of gamma rays as a function of wavelength and photon energy. In the TeV-EeV energy range the anticipated fluxes are dwarfed by the cosmic ray flux which is also shown in the figure. Astronomy with neutrinos does, however, have definite advantages. <p> Astronomy with neutrinos does, however, have definite advantages. They can reach us, essentially without attenuation in flux, from the largest red-shifts. The sky is, in contrast, partially opaque to high energy photons and protons because of energy-loss suffered in interactions with infrared and CMBR photons <ref> [4] </ref>. They do not reach us from distances much larger than tens of megaparsecs once their energy exceeds thresholds of 10 TeV for photons and 5 fi 10 7 TeV for protons.

Reference-contexts: The drawback is that neutrinos are difficult to detect: the small interaction cross sections that enable them to travel without attenuation over a Hubble radius, are also the reason why kilometer-scale detectors are required in order to capture them in sufficient numbers to do astronomy <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The leptonic decays of the heavy quark and weak boson annihilation products turn the sun into a source of high-energy neutrinos with energies in the GeV to TeV range. The potential of neutrino telescopes as dark matter detectors has been documented in detail <ref> [6] </ref>. With a sensitivity which increases with the WIMP mass, they are complementary to direct, cryogenic detectors. They can detect WIMPS beyond the kinematic limits of the LHC: about 500 GeV for neutralinos. <p> Confirmation of the so-called "atmospheric anomaly" in a higher energy regime would undoubtedly be valuable. If the stable, lightest supersymmetric particle impersonates the cold dark matter, neutrino telescopes of kilometer scale cover most of the parameter space of supersymmetric models <ref> [6] </ref>. We know that the cold dark matter particles have masses in excess of tens of GeV, otherwise they would have been detected at existing accelerators.

Reference-contexts: With a sensitivity which increases with the WIMP mass, they are complementary to direct, cryogenic detectors. They can detect WIMPS beyond the kinematic limits of the LHC: about 500 GeV for neutralinos. A striking way to illustrate their potential is to use the possible detection <ref> [7] </ref> in the DAMA NaI detector in the Gran Sasso tunnel as an example.

Reference-contexts: Beam dumps produce electron- and muon-neutrinos. Therefore the appearance of tau neutrinos in the detector is evidence for oscillations <ref> [8] </ref>. Above 5 fi 10 8 TeV the travel path of a secondary tau exceeds the range of a muon.

Reference-contexts: In GRB observations one can clock the arrival time of neutrinos relative to photons over millisecond times and 1000 Mpc distance. Precision of 10 4 eV may be possible <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such oscillation will trace a single sinusoidal flux in a kilometer-deep detector with a threshold of tens of GeV <ref> [10] </ref>; see Fig. 2. Confirmation of the so-called "atmospheric anomaly" in a higher energy regime would undoubtedly be valuable. If the stable, lightest supersymmetric particle impersonates the cold dark matter, neutrino telescopes of kilometer scale cover most of the parameter space of supersymmetric models [6].

Reference-contexts: The ultimate particle physics within reach of neutrino telescopes covers topological defects. These structures represent an intrinsic feature of grand unified gauge theory which cannot be probed in accelerator experiments. Neutrinos constitute the dominant flux, by roughly two orders of magnitude, emitted by oscillating strings or annihilating monopoles <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: Up-going muons are to be identified in a background of down-going, cosmic ray muons which are more than 10 5 times more frequent for a depth of 1~2 kilometers. The method is sketched in Fig. 3. Construction of the first-generation AMANDA detector <ref> [12] </ref> was completed in the austral summer 96-97. It consists of 300 optical modules deployed at a depth of 1500-2000 m; see Fig. 4. An optical module (OM) consists of an 8 inch photomultiplier tube and nothing else.

Reference-contexts: The optical properties of the ice are quantified by studying the propagation in the ice of pulses of laser light of nanosecond duration. The arrival times of the photons after 20 m and 40 m are shown in Fig. 6 for the shallow and deep ice <ref> [13] </ref>. The distributions have been normalized to equal areas; in reality, the probability that a photon travels 70 m in the deep ice is ~10 7 times larger. <p> The measured arrival directions of background cosmic ray muon tracks, reconstructed with 5 or more unscattered photons, are confronted with their known angular distribution in Fig. 7. The agreement with Monte Carlo simulation is adequate. Less than one in 10 5 tracks is misreconstructed as originating below the detector <ref> [13] </ref>. Visual inspection reveals that the remaining misreconstructed tracks are mostly showers, radiated by muons or initiated by electron neutrinos, misreconstructed as up-going tracks of muon neutrino origin.

Reference-contexts: The diagram shows the diffusion of the track by bubbles above 1 km depth. Early and late hits, not associated with the track, are photomultiplier noise. The reality is that: the absorption length is 100 m or more, depending on depth <ref> [14] </ref>, the scattering length is 25~30 m (preliminary), because of the large absorption length OM spacings are similar, actually larger, than that those of proposed water detectors. Also, a typical event triggers 20 OMs, not 6. Of these more than 5 photons are not scattered.

Reference-contexts: Also, a typical event triggers 20 OMs, not 6. Of these more than 5 photons are not scattered. In the end, reconstruction is therefore as before, although additional information can be extracted from scattered photons by minimizing a likelihood function which matches measured and expected delays <ref> [15] </ref>. 8 Fig. 5b. Cosmic ray muon track triggered by both shallow and deep AMANDA OMs. Trigger times are shown separately for each string in the deep detector. In this event the muon mostly triggers OMs on strings 1 and 4 which are separated by 79.5 m. <p> Monte Carlo simulation, based on this exercise, confirms that AMANDA-300 is a 10 4 m 2 detector with 2.5 degrees mean angular resolution <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Monte Carlo simulation, based on this exercise, confirms that AMANDA-300 is a 10 4 m 2 detector with 2.5 degrees mean angular resolution [15]. We have verified the angular resolution of AMANDA-80 by reconstructing muon tracks registered in coincidence with a surface air shower array <ref> [16] </ref>. 6 Towards ICE CUBE (D) A strawman detector with effective area in excess of 1 km 2 consists of 4800 OMs: 80 strings spaced by ~ 100 m, each instrumented with 60 OMs spaced by 15 m.

Reference-contexts: The price tag of the default technology used in AMANDA-300 is $6000 per OM, including cables and DAQ electronics. We have also tested a new technology with very promising results. The charge of the photomultiplier is transformed into a light pulse by a LED <ref> [17] </ref>. This signal can be transmitted to the surface by fiber optic cable without loss of 12 information.

Reference-contexts: This signal can be transmitted to the surface by fiber optic cable without loss of 12 information. Given the scientific range and promise of such an instrument, a kilometer-scale neutrino detector must be one of the best motivated scientific endeavors ever. 7 About Water <ref> [18] </ref> and Ice The optical requirements of the detector medium can be readily evaluated, at least to first order, by noting that string spacings determine the cost of the detector.

Reference-contexts: These advantages remain, even though we know now that water and ice are competitive as a detector medium. They are, in fact, complementary. Water and ice seem to have similar attenuation length, with the role of scattering and absorption reversed. As demonstrated with the shallow AMANDA strings <ref> [19] </ref>, scattering can be exploited to range out the light and perform calorimetry of showers produced by electron-neutrinos and showering muons. Long scattering lengths in water may result in superior angular resolution, especially for the smaller, first-generation detectors.
