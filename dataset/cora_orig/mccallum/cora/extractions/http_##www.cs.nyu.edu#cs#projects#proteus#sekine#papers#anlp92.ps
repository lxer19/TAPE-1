Abstract: The real difficulty in development of practical NLP systems comes from the fact that we do not have effective means for gathering "knowledge". In this paper, we propose an algorithm which acquires automatically knowledge of semantic collocations among "words" from sample corpora. The algorithm proposed in this paper tries to discover semantic collocations which will be useful for disambiguating structurally ambiguous sentences, by a statistical approach. The algorithm requires a corpus and minimum linguistic knowledge (parts-of-speech of words, simple inflection rules, and a small number of general syntactic rules). We conducted two experiments of applying the algorithm to different corpora to extract different types of semantic collocations. Though there are some unsolved problems, the results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algo rithm.

Reference-contexts: However, the real difficulty in developing practical NLP systems is due to the fact that we do not have effective means for gathering the "knowledge", whether lin fl SEKINE is now a visitor at C.C.L., U.M.I.S.T. sekine@ccl.umist.ac.uk guistic or extra-linguistic. In particular, it has been reported <ref> [ Ananiadou, 1990 ] </ref> that not only extra-linguistic, domain knowledge but also linguistic knowledge required for application systems varies, depending on text-type (technical reports, scientific papers, manuals, etc.), subject domain, type of application (MT, automatic abstraction, etc.) etc.

Reference-contexts: There are the problems related with context, discourse, situation etc.. We want to weave these problems into our algorithm. It also has to be noted that rather local, structural preferential clues may help disam biguations. <ref> [ Wilks, 1985 ] </ref> (d) Word distance Though we currently assume that the semantic distances of words are given in the form of single numbers, our research group is now planning to extend to cover multi-dimensional aspects of word meanings.

Reference-contexts: The two chicken and egg problems in the above are treated differently in the algorithm. We focus on the first problem in this paper, while readers who are interested in the second problem can refer to <ref> [ Sekine et al., 1992 ] </ref> In the following, we call the tuples generated from sample texts by a parser "instance-tuples" and the tuples to which plausibility value are assigned "hypothesis-tuples". Instance-tuples and hypothesis-tuples are indicated by [A, R, B] and (A, R, B), respectively. <p> We expect this should resolve the second type of chicken and egg problems.
