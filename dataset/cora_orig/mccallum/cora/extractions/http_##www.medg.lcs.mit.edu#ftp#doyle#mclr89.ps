Abstract: One attractive route to developing a theory of limited rationality is through the notion of rational control of reasoning. Rational control is sometimes viewed in terms of rational allocation of limited computational resources in drawing conclusions, with ideal rationality just the infinite-resource case of resource-bounded inference. But some important sorts of limitations on rationality due to rational control of reasoning subsist independently of any limitations on resources. One of these is the notion of the agent's constitution, a set of restrictions placed on the permissible states of the agent by the agent or by its designer. While the theory of ideal rationality permits agents to have any consistent and complete set of beliefs and preferences (probabilities and utilities), agents limited by constitutions may forbid some of those sets. We motivate and formalize some elements of a theory of mental constitutions.

Reference-contexts: of consistency and closure (i.e., weaker logics) are the rule, such as the closure and consistency enforced on concept descriptions by automatic taxonomic classifiers in languages like NIKL [ Vilain, 1985 ] , or the closure under resolution and consistency with respect to explicitly noted contradictions enforced by an ATMS <ref> [ de Kleer, 1986 ] </ref> . If we view the state space as a data structure, then logics of attitudes provide "upper bounds" on the state space (to be restricted further by laws of thought), or alternatively, provide lower bounds on the internal structure required of individual states.

The primary way is that constitutions restrict the range of possible choices available to the agent.

Finally, we say that a set X D is satisfying just in case it satisfies each of the constitutive intentions it contains, that is, if X 2 i ((x)) for every x 2 I ? (X).

Reference-contexts: In some cases nonlogical restrictions might be naturally made part of the fixed constitution, as global conditions on states which refine the constitutive logic. One example might be the rationality of the set of constructive attitudes contained in a state with respect to the state's manifest attitudes <ref> [ Doyle, 1989 ] </ref> . But many sorts of nonlogical restrictions, such as individual defaults or reason maintenance justifications, are naturally viewed as locally applicable laws of thought or constitutive intentions.

Reference-contexts: A classic example is that of Ulysses, who had himself bound to his ship's mast so that he could hear the Sirens in safety (see <ref> [ Elster, 1979 ] </ref> ). He knew that to hear them was to be drawn irresistably to them, regardless of the ultimately fatal consequences, but that bondage would rule out the possibility of acting to reach them. Computational examples are also common in artificial intelligence.
