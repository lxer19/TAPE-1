Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on iterated, noncooperative N-person games with limited interaction are considered. Each player in the game has a payoff function and a set of actions. While each player acts to maximise his payoff, we are interested in the global behavior of the team of players, measured by the average payoff received by the team. To evolve a global behavior in the system, we propose two coevolutionary schemes with evaluation only local fitness functions. The first scheme we call loosely coupled genetic algorithms, and the second one loosely coupled classifier systems. We present simulation results which indicate that the global behavior in both systems evolves, and is achieved only by a local cooperation between players acting without global information about the system. The models of coevolutionary multi-agent systems are applied to develop parallel and distributed algorithms of dynamic mapping and scheduling tasks in parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: A game-theoretic model which has received much attention of late is the prisoner's dilemma (Rapoport 1966, Axelrod 1987, Lomborg 1992, Fogel 1993). This two-player, non cooperative game has been explored to yield insight into the conditions of cooperating and defecting between players. Evolutionary computation methods using genetic algorithms <ref> (Axelrod 1987) </ref> or finite state machines (Fogel 1991) have been successfully used to discover TIT FOR TAT strategy or better strategies of behavior. One of the distinctive features of the prisoner's dilemma is a focus on a player's individual goal. <p> The last section contains our conclusions. 2 N-Person Games with Limited Interaction 2.1 Prisoner's Dilemma Background The typical two person prisoner's dilemma is described by a matrix shown in Table 1 <ref> (Axelrod 1987, Fogel 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The need of an extension of the traditional GAs into the direction of coevolutionary systems has been lately recognized. While a cooperative coevolutionary approach to function optimization has been proposed (Potter & De Yong 1994), loosely coupled GAs (LCGAs) have been proposed <ref> (Seredynski 1994b) </ref> to support the above described game-theoretic model of computation, suitable for distributed decision-making. 6 3.1 Loosely Coupled GA-based Systems The idea of LCGAs implementing the game on a ring from Figure 1a is shown in Figure 3.
