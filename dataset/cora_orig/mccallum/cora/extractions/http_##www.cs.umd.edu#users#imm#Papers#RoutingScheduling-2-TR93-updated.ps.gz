Abstract: The Internet is expected to support various services, including best-effort services and guaranteed services. For best-effort services, we propose a new approach to achieving type-of-service (TOS) with adaptive next-hop routing. We consider two traffic classes, namely delay-sensitive and throughput-sensitive. In routing protocols such as OSPF and integrated IS-IS, each node has a different next-hop for each destination and TOS. Traditionally, each node has a single FCFS queue for each outgoing link, and the next-hops are computed using link measurements. In our approach, we attempt to isolate the two traffic classes by using two FCFS queues for each outgoing link, one for each TOS; the link is shared cyclicly between the two TOS queues. The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that traffic. The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to overall link utilizations. We compare our approach with the traditional approach using discrete-event simulation and Liapunov analysis (for stability of routes). The proposed approach offers lower end-to-end delay to the delay-sensitive traffic. A related property is that the routes for the delay-sensitive traffic are more stable, i.e. less oscillations. An unexpected property is that the overall end-to-end delay is lower; this is because the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away to under-utilized routes, thus isolating the two traffic classes and yielding a better overall network performance. fl This work is supported in part by ARPA and Philips Labs under contract DASG60-92-0055 to Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

We represented isolation by a stable state where all delay-sensitive traffic stays on the first path, and all throughput-sensitive traffic stays on the second path. We applied the Liapunov function method, and derived stability theorems ignoring propagation delays. <p> The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [3, 22] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

Reference-contexts: At any instant, we describe the state of the network by the tuple (x; y), where x is the number of delay-sensitive connections on path 1, and y is the number of throughput-sensitive connections on path 1. To model routing updates, we use a discrete-time flow approach as in <ref> [4] </ref>. We assume that (some or all) connections periodically update their routes to D every 4 time units, where 4 is long enough for the network to reach steady-state after a routing update.

Reference-contexts: TOS1 with respect to delays; TOS1 reaches saturation sooner. (See Figure 2.) Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [21, 17, 5] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources.

Our approach We consider a simple two-queue link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as type-of-service queueing. We consider two TOS: low delay and high throughput. <p> With type-of-service queueing, each node maintains two FCFS queues for each outgoing link, one for each type of service. The link bandwidth is allocated equally between the two queues in a round-robin fashion. (Type-of-service queueing is similar to the recently proposed fair-queueing discipline <ref> [11] </ref>, except that in fair-queueing, the link bandwidth is divided equally amongst the connections using the link, rather than the types of service.) For any link, the link cost for delay-sensitive traffic is obtained by exponentially averaging the measured delay that is experienced by delay-sensitive packets only. <p> This leads to oscillatory behavior, 6 which in turn degrades performance [21]. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline. In TOS2, because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under type-of-service queueing <ref> [11] </ref>, the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes [21].

Reference-contexts: To keep these views up-to-date, each node regularly broadcasts the link costs of its outgoing links to all other nodes using flooding 3 . As a node receives this information, it updates its view of the network topology and applies Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> to choose its next-hop for each destination and TOS. The method used to compute link costs for each TOS depends on the link scheduling discipline. In all cases, each node's outgoing link costs are updated regularly.

Reference-contexts: It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 5 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes <ref> [13] </ref>. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class.

Reference-contexts: Such simultaneous traffic shifts result in a bad performance, i.e. higher delay and network under-utilization. This effect increases as ff k increases. (In practice, ff k depend on several factors, and can be quite high <ref> [15] </ref>.) Consider the simple case where ff k = 1, for all k. It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 5 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes [13]. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned here with achieving TOS using next-hop (datagram) routing as it proved to be a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing of best-effort traffic <ref> [28, 21] </ref>. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows. Each node maintains for each destination node and TOS, a neighboring node id, referred to as the next-hop. Every data packet header contains its destination id and the TOS requested by the application. <p> TOS1 with respect to delays; TOS1 reaches saturation sooner. (See Figure 2.) Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [21, 17, 5] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. <p> This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. Consequently, at the next routing update the link reports a very low cost and becomes attractive again. This leads to oscillatory behavior, 6 which in turn degrades performance <ref> [21] </ref>. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline. In TOS2, because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under type-of-service queueing [11], the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. <p> Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes <ref> [21] </ref>. This improves the performance of delay-based routing of delay-sensitive packets and results in more stable routes for that traffic class. Meanwhile, the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away from the delay-sensitive traffic, taking the under-utilized routes. <p> Ignoring low values of U (T ), UTIL also provides lower delays than TOS1. However, UTIL performs worse than TOS2 over the whole range of U (T ). This is expected, since the utilization-based metric does not necessarily result in minimum delay routes (especially at light load) <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 Stability Analysis In this section, we consider a simple network model to gain more insight into the complicated behavior we observed in our simulation experiments. We derive stability conditions for the routes of the two traffic classes under both TOS schemes (TOS1, TOS2).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, non-convergence 9 indicates that the system oscillates between different routing patterns (or has chaotic behavior). Note that I is not a continuous mapping, and well-known theorems for convergence requiring this property cannot be directly applied <ref> [22] </ref>. We represent isolation by a stable state where every delay-sensitive connection stays on path 1, and every throughput-sensitive connection stays on path 2. This is equivalent to say that our iterative method converges to the fixed point (N; 0). <p> The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [3, 22] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

In particular, our monte-carlo simulations <ref> [27, 26] </ref> show that starting at any point in D 2 satisfying 1 0:5C 1 N+x + P 1 1 (C 2 +0:5x)x + P 2 , the iteration indeed leads to the origin. <p> In this region, the necessary conditions for isolation, defined in (10) and (13), for both TOS1 and TOS2 are satisfied. This region thus defines sufficient conditions to reach isolation for low enough ff k for both TOS1 and TOS2. This is in agreement with our monte-carlo simulations obtained in <ref> [27, 26] </ref> which also show that in this region, TOS2 gives much better transient performance, i.e. less oscillations and much faster convergence to isolation, than TOS1 (we have not yet been able to obtain transient measures analytically). <p> Theorem 3.4 (i) For TOS1, the conditions N + M C 1 1 ( 1 C 2 N C 1 (regions B and C in 6 These conditions were obtained in <ref> [27, 26] </ref> (in a different way) using a worst-case analysis. 16 (ii) For TOS2, the corresponding conditions are N 0:5C 1 1 ( 1 C 2 N C 1 (regions A and C in Figure 6). The proof of Theorem 3.4 is given in Appendix II.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned here with achieving TOS using next-hop (datagram) routing as it proved to be a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing of best-effort traffic <ref> [28, 21] </ref>. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows. Each node maintains for each destination node and TOS, a neighboring node id, referred to as the next-hop. Every data packet header contains its destination id and the TOS requested by the application. <p> TOS2 uses type-of-service queueing. In all schemes, routing packets have priority over data packets; i.e. data packets can be scheduled for transmission only if there are no routing packets present. Regarding routing, we consider a link-state algorithm like the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm used in the ARPANET <ref> [28] </ref> and OSPF (Open SPF) used in the Internet [30]. Each node maintains a time-varying cost (explained below) for each outgoing link and TOS. Each node also maintains a view of the network topology, with a cost for each TOS and link in the network.

Reference-contexts: Among them are the minimum delay service required for example by interactive traffic or real-time traffic (e.g. audio), and the maximum throughput service required for example by bulk transfers such as network mail or FTP. Routing protocols such as the Internet OSPF <ref> [30] </ref> and the OSI IS-IS [8] provide separate next-hops for each TOS. However, the TOS mechanism has been so far of little use, and little is known on how well it would work in practice. <p> Regarding routing, we consider a link-state algorithm like the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm used in the ARPANET [28] and OSPF (Open SPF) used in the Internet <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The sequence of points (x 1 ; y 1 ); (x 2 ; y 2 ); : : : is called the trajectory of the system <ref> [24, 31] </ref>. The trajectory may or may not converge to a fixed point (x fl ; y fl ), i.e. (x fl ; y fl ) = I (x fl ; y fl ). The convergence to a fixed point indicates that the system stabilizes into a particular routing pattern. <p> starting state. (In a real network, the starting state would be the result of arrivals of new connections, departures of old connections, failure/recovery of links, etc.) We then obtain less refined sufficient conditions for isolation, independent of the starting state. 3.2 Liapunov Function Method We use the Liapunov function method <ref> [31] </ref> to obtain sufficient conditions for stability and convergence to a fixed point without actually solving the system equations. <p> Consequently, starting at any point in D 1 , the trajectory stays inside D 1 approaching the origin (as shown in Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class. This concept of isolating traffic classes using structured queueing disciplines has been used recently in flow control studies, e.g. <ref> [11, 20, 6, 32, 14] </ref>. In this paper, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider a simple two-queue link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as type-of-service queueing. We consider two TOS: low delay and high throughput.

The focus of this paper is the provision of different types of best-effort services. To meet various requirements in terms of type of service (TOS), e.g. low delay or high throughput, a network's routing protocol should be able to determine appropriate routes for each TOS. <p> In this study, we assumed a datagram (best-effort) service model of the sort currently used in the Internet. Extensive effort is currently underway to extend this Internet service model to support other services, including guaranteed service <ref> [7, 9, 33] </ref>. In such an extended service environment, our findings would still apply to traffic classes requiring best-effort service. In addition to simulation studies, we examined the behavior of the TOS schemes analytically. We obtained stability conditions using the Liapunov function method.

Reference-contexts: Future work is also needed to explore the interaction between all components of the congestion control problem, namely scheduling, flow control, and routing, on arbitrary network topologies. We are also investigating other approaches to adaptive next-hop TOS routing. One approach <ref> [40] </ref> is to maintain for delay-sensitive traffic two minimum propagation delay routes and use the secondary route when the primary route becomes congested. This approach attempts to avoid the bad effect that queueing delay may have when it dominates measured link delay in delay-based routing.
