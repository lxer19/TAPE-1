Title: Applications of the Matroid Parity Problem to Approximating Steiner Trees  
Author: Piotr Berman Martin Furer Alexander Zelikovsky 
Note: 4 3 80 1:2875, in the second  
Abstract: The Steiner tree problem in graphs requires to find a minimum size connected subgraph containing a given subset of nodes (given points). In this paper we consider this problem in three classes of graphs: where the maximum path distance is 2, where given points form a dominating set and where the given points form a vertex cover. As all these problems are MAX-SNP hard, the issue is what approximation can be obtained in polynomial time. In the first case we obtain an approximation ratio (of the achieved size over the minimal one) 5 case we achieve 4/3, and in the last case we achieve 8=7 1=160. 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: In the first problem we restrict ourselves to graphs where every two nodes have a distance 1 or 2. Bern and Plassman <ref> [1] </ref> have already investigated this problem from an approximation point of view. They have shown that Rayward-Smith's heuristic [6] has a performance ratio 4/3 for such graphs. We generalize Rayward-Smith's heuristic and combine it with the exact algorithm for the matroid parity problem. <p> This problem was first considered by Bern and Plassmann in <ref> [1] </ref> where they proved the MAX SNP hardness of this particular case of the Steiner tree problem and, therefore, the MAX SNP hardness of the general problem. They also suggest the 4/3-approximation algorithm which we improve in this section. Let P (#P = n) be the set of given points. <p> Note that Rayward-Smith's heuristic from <ref> [1] </ref> consists of the quick stage for i = :::6; 5; 4; 3 and the final stage. First, we consider the quick stage when i 5. Each contraction of an i-star decrements the lengths of the both: the approximate and optimal solutions.

Reference-contexts: Known examples are finding a minimum feedback vertex set in a cubic graphs, equivalently, a maximum size acyclic induced subgraph and finding a maximum planar subgraph <ref> [2] </ref>. Another is finding a Steiner minimum tree in a graph where the given points form an independent set and a vertex cover and the non-given points are adjacent to at most three given points each. However, until now, very few such applications were found.

Reference-contexts: This problem was solved by Lovasz [4], and much more efficient algorithms were later found by Orlin and Vande Vate [5] and Gabow and Stallmann <ref> [3] </ref> for graphic matroids. Numerous graph problems can be expressed in the language of linear matroids, therefore one should expect that a number of them would be solved using an algorithm for matroid parity.

Reference-contexts: Briefly stated, we have a collection of 2 fi n matrices, and our goal is to find a maximum size sub-collection such that they can be stacked into a single matrix of maximum rank. This problem was solved by Lovasz <ref> [4] </ref>, and much more efficient algorithms were later found by Orlin and Vande Vate [5] and Gabow and Stallmann [3] for graphic matroids.
