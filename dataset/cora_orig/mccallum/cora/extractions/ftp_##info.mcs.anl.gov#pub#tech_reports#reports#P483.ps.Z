Abstract: We describe a parallel implementation of the nonhydrostatic version of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model, MM5, that includes nesting capabilities. This version of the model can run on many different massively parallel computers (including a cluster of workstations). The model has been implemented and run on the IBM SP and Intel multiprocessors using a columnwise decomposition that supports irregularly shaped allocations of the problem to processors. This stategy will facilitate dynamic load balancing for improved parallel efficiency and promotes a modular design that simplifies the nesting problem. All data communication for finite differencing, inter-domain exchange of data, and I/O is encapsulated within a parallel library, RSL. Hence, there are no sends or receives in the parallel model itself. The library is generalizable to other, similar finite difference approximation codes. The code is validated by comparing the rate of growth in error between the sequential and parallel models with the error growth rate when the sequential model input is perturbed to simulate floating point rounding error. Series of runs on increasing numbers of parallel processors demonstrate that the parallel implementation is efficient and scalable to large numbers of processors.

Reference-contexts: For this implementation, atmospheric dynamics is nonhydrostatic and uses finite-difference approximation. Physics includes the Blackadar high-resolution planetary boundary layer scheme, the Grell cumulus scheme, explicit moisture with treatment of mixed-phase processes (ice), shallow convection, dry convective adjustment, and the Dudhia long-and short-wave radiation scheme <ref> [1] </ref>. fl This work was supported by the Applied Mathematical Sciences subprogram of the Office of Scientific Computing, U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38.

Reference-contexts: It also provides for small units of work (single columns) and allows for irregularly shaped allocations of work to processors, thereby facilitating load balancing. Additional information on RSL can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 Parallel MM5 code has been converted so that the model may be called separately for each column of the grid.

Reference-contexts: All gross structure of the function within the original model is reproduced in the parallel code. A more rigorous verification of correctness with respect to the original model is being conducted using the error-growth analysis technique of Rosin-ski and Williamson <ref> [4] </ref>. The technique involves measuring the growth in error in selected output fields between two runs of the sequential model, in which the second run has been initialized with data that has been perturbed by flipping the lowest-order bit in each floating-point value, thereby simulating the effect of rounding error.
