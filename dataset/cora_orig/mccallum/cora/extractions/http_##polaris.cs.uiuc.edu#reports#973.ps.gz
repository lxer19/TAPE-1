Reference-contexts: Its descriptions power in the morphological axis, however, is very limited, allowing the description of topological features, but not geometrical ones. The basic structural elements of a system described in LIDEX are the two type of carriers: registers (memory carriers) and busses (memoryless carriers) <ref> [1] </ref>. These basic elements are used for building up modules, and modules in turn can be used to build more complex modules, until we have the complete system. Besides its structure, each module also has an algorithmic description of its behavior.

Reference-contexts: The description of a digital systems spans over three different design axis: the structural, the behavioral, and the morphological. Some languages do allow description in all three axis, but most hardware description languages emphasize one or two of the axis <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. LIDEX is particularly strong at the behavioral axis, and very good at the structural axis. Its descriptions power in the morphological axis, however, is very limited, allowing the description of topological features, but not geometrical ones.

Reference-contexts: We will the proceed in a top-down approach, describing simultaneously both the syntax and the semantics of the language. 2 2 Basics We will describe the syntax of LIDEX using the notation of YACC <ref> [4] </ref>. This is more than reasonable, since the simulator for LIDEX was written with YACC, and the definitions presented here are the actual inputs to YACC, so there is no danger of disagreement between the language definition and the implementation.

Reference-contexts: In the end of the reference manual there is an alphabetic index of the language constructs, with the page numbers where the definition for each one is found. For examples of utilization of LIDEX the reader is recommended to read the document "LIDEX Tutorial" <ref> [7] </ref>. 4 definition: system syntax: system : "system" identifier ";" systemconstclause unitmodulelist "end" ; unitmodulelist : unitmodule | unitmodulelist unitmodule ; unitmodule : unit | module ; semantics: A digital system is built up of modules.
