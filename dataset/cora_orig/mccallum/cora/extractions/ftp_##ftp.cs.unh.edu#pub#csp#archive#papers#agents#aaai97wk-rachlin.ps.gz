Abstract: Cooperative schedulin g is concerned with integrating multiple problemsolving perspectives or objectives when generating solutions to a scheduling problem. Cooperation may involve interactions between humans, between scheduling agents, or between humans and agents. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the later two types of cooperation in which a team of software-based asynchronous agents play a major role in identifying candidate scheduling alternatives. This socalled A-Team architecture is at the heart of a set of decisionsupport tools that employ cooperative scheduling techniques for scheduling the operations of real-world paper manufacturing facilities. The IBM Paper Mill Scheduling System was developed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center over the past couple of years and is currently being sold worldwide.

Reference-contexts: A performance analysis of parallel implementations of asynchronous team algorithms can be found in <ref> (Barn, Kaszkurewicz, & Bhaya, 1996) </ref>. In an ATeam, cooperation between agents is possible because one agent can work on the output of another. In general, agents may take as input any number of existing solutions as input and produce as output any number of solutions.

Reference-contexts: However, almost all paper manufacturing processes share several major elements, or subprocesses. In this section we will briefly describe a generic paper manufacturing process as background information to motivate the AI solution that is the subject of this paper. Further details can be found in <ref> (Biermann 1993) </ref>. A paper company may have hundreds of different customers each with their own specific requirements.

Reference-contexts: It is still necessary for a human scheduler to intervene by modifying existing solutions, and in so doing, interject into the solutions knowledge not necessarily captured by individual agents or evaluation criteria. This approach is not entirely new. For example, <ref> (Bertolotti 1992) </ref> describes a scheduling system, AERPLAN, which, like the IBM paper mill scheduling system, relies on the interaction of a user to address special case scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Reels are then processed through a winder that unrolls the reel, and uses slitters (knives) to cut the deckle into narrower lengths of paper. These narrower strips are rewound to form rolls. This subprocess is called trimming and exemplifies the classic cuttingstock problem <ref> (Gilmore & Gomory 1961) </ref>, where the goal here is to maximize utilization of the deckle while satisfying the requirements of each order to within specified tolerances. 7UXFNVflDQGfl7UDLQV ff/RDGSODQQLQJfi 5DZfl0DWHULDOV 3XOS*fl.UDIW*flHWF 3DSHUfl0DFKLQHV ff5XQfl)RUPDWLRQflDQGfl 6HTXHQFLQJfi 5HHOV flfl :LQGHUV ff7ULPPLQJfi 6KHHWHUV ff)LQLVKLQJfi &XVWRPHUV :DUHKRXVHV 3RUWV 5ROOV 3DOOHWV As each set of rolls is completed,

Reference-contexts: ATeams also have certain characteristics of a genetic algorithm in that a population of solutions evolves over time. However the mechanisms for altering individual solutions may be highly directed by taking into account domain specific knowledge, rather than depending upon random mutation or crossover. <ref> (Horn, Nafpliotis, & Goldberg 1994) </ref> presents a method for finding the Pareto frontier using a genetic algorithm, and also describes related work on multi-objective optimization using GAs.

Reference-contexts: No single agent is critical. <ref> (Huberman, Lukose, & Hogg 1997) </ref> demonstrates how combining multiple algorithms together produces solutions which are preferable to the solutions generated by individual algorithms operating alone, and offers a measure for the degree of cooperation involved based on statistical correlations of performance.

Reference-contexts: While this paper focuses on the application of ATeams to paper manufacturing scheduling, ATeam based scheduling systems have also been developed for the steel industry <ref> (Lee et al. 1996) </ref>. An ATeam architecture consists of a population of solutions and three types of agents which create and modify this population. The different agent types are: 1. Constructors that create initial solutions. 2.

Reference-contexts: In short the special relationships between the mill, its customers, and its distributors may dictate policies that cannot be encompassed by a single weighting factor. Our agent-based scheduling system addresses many of the limitations of existing jobshop scheduling systems identified by <ref> (McKay Safayeni & Buzacott, 1988) </ref> by providing a decisionsupport framework for scheduling that naturally accounts for conflicting and changing goals.
