Reference-contexts: A different and very simple sufficiency proof of the same result was given in 1978 by Fisk [4]. This proof was used by Avis and Toussaint to implement an algorithm running in O (n log n) time, to assign positions to the guards <ref> [1] </ref>. If the art gallery is allowed to have obstructions (e.g. pillars) in its interior, the corresponding floor plan is a simple polygon with other simple, disjoint polygons called holes inside. In such a polygon, bn=3c guards are no longer sufficient.

Reference-contexts: Shermer's results can be found in [8]. In 1991, two independent and dramatically different proofs were generated for the fact that b (n + h)=3c point guards are also sufficient: one by us <ref> [2] </ref> and one by Hoffmann, Kaufmann and Kriegel [7]. Neither paper gave details of algorithms for placing the guards, but the algorithm derived from the Hoffmann et al. proof has complexity O (n 3 log n) [6].

Reference-contexts: The original art gallery problem, posed in 1973 by Klee [5], asks for the number of guards required to survey any art gallery with n walls and no interior obstructions. The problem was soon solved by Chvatal <ref> [3] </ref>, who showed that bn=3c vertex guards are both necessary and sufficient. A different and very simple sufficiency proof of the same result was given in 1978 by Fisk [4].

Reference-contexts: We are concerned with the visibility between the guards and the remaining points in the polygon. A guard x sees a point y if the line segment xy does not intersect the exterior of the polygon.

Reference-contexts: Neither paper gave details of algorithms for placing the guards, but the algorithm derived from the Hoffmann et al. proof has complexity O (n 3 log n) <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper we present an O (n 2 ) algorithm to place the guards. Since the algorithm derives from the constructive nature of our proof, we start by giving the proof.

Reference-contexts: Shermer had already established in 1982 that b (n + h)=3c guards are necessary for a polygon with n vertices and h holes. Shermer's results can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. In 1991, two independent and dramatically different proofs were generated for the fact that b (n + h)=3c point guards are also sufficient: one by us [2] and one by Hoffmann, Kaufmann and Kriegel [7]. <p> of finding a tight bound on the number of vertex guards required to guard a polygon with h holes and a total of n vertices remains open. b (n + h)=3c vertex guards are certainly necessary but the best known upper bound is b (n + 2h)=3c established by O'Rourke <ref> [8] </ref> in 1982. 6 Acknowledgements We thank Joe O'Rourke for the many helpful comments and suggestions to improve the presentation of this paper. 42
