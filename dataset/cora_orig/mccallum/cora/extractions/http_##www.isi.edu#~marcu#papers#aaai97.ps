Abstract: We present a new, data-driven approach to text planning, which can be used not only to map full knowledge pools into natural language texts, but also to generate texts that satisfy multiple, high-level communicative goals. The approach explains how global coherence can be achieved by exploiting the local coherence constraints of rhetorical relations. The local constraints were derived from a corpus analysis. All current flexible approaches to text planning that assume that the abstract structure of text is a tree-like structure are, esentially, top-down approaches. Some of them define plan operators and exploit hierarchical planning techniques (Hovy 1993; Moore and Paris 1993; Moore and Swartout 1991; Cawsey 1991; Maybury 1992) and partial-order planning techniques (Young and Moore 1994). Others assume that plans are hierarchically organized sets of frames that can be derived through a top-down expansion process (Nirenburg et al. 1989; Meteer 1992). And the recursive application of schemata (McKeown 1985) can be thought of as a top-down expansion process as well. One of the major strengths of all these approaches is that, given a high-level communicative goal, they can interleave the task of text planning and content selection, and produce different texts for different knowledge bases and users (McKeown 1985; Paris 1991; McCoy and Cheng 1991; Moore and Swartout 1991). Unfortunately, this strength is also a major weakness, because top-down and schema-based approaches are inadequate when the high-level communicative goal boils down to tell everything that is in this knowledge base or everything that is in this chosen subset. The reason for this inadequacy is that these approaches cannot ensure that all the knowledge that makes up a knowledge pool will be eventually mapped into the leaves of the resulting text plan: after building a partial text plan, which encodes a certain amount of the information found in the initial knowledge pool, it is highly possible that the information that is still unrealized will satisfy none of the active communicative goals. In fact, because the plan construction is plan-operator- or schema-step-driven,
