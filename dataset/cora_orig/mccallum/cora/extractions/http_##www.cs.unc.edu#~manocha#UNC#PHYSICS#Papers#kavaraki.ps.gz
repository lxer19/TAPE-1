Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to path planning for robots with many degrees of freedom (dof) operating in known static environments. The approach consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. Preprocessing, which is done only once for a given environment, generates a network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). Planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. Experiments show that after paying the preprocessing cost (on the order of hundreds of seconds), planning is extremely fast (on the order of a fraction of a second for many difficult examples involving a 10-dof robot). The approach is particularly attractive for many-dof robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment.

The length of the random walk can be chosen uniformly in the interval <ref> [1; max length] </ref>, where max length is a constant. The above step can be repeated a few times if necessary. The same procedure is followed for y. Let A and B be the nodes with which x and y get connected.

Reference-contexts: Two rev-olute joints are located at J 3 . The description can be generalized easily to any articulated linkage <ref> [11] </ref>. 1. Generation of random configurations. To create a random configuration of the robot we draw each dof uniformly from its allowed range. Then we check the resulting configuration for collision with the obstacles and self collision. <p> For this case, after a preprocessing of only 150 seconds we can connect all the configurations of Fig. 3 to the network in less than 0.1 sec. Here, a single component is produced at the end of the enhancement step. Other examples can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. 7 Conclusion We have described a new method for planning paths for robots with many dof. In this paper we analyze its performance on a difficult example. We have experimented with many 6 to 10 dof robots with very good results.

Reference-contexts: This technique is practical only for 2D workspaces, since 3D workspaces would require the generation of six-dimensional bitmaps. We use it in our planner (we discretize each dof to 128 values) and in particular we compute the C-space bitmaps with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform <ref> [12] </ref>. For self-collision, each link of the robot is tested against the others. 6 Experimental Results The planner is implemented in C and we used a DEC Alpha workstation (Model Flamingo) running under DEC OSF/1 for our experiments. This machine is rated at 121.5 SPECmark89.
