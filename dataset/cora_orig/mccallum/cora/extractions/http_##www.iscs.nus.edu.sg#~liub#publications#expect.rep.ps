Reference-contexts: M (X) gives a meaning to each term. For example, ~ M (slow) may be defined as follows: M (slow) =-(u, m slow (u)) | u <ref> [1, 140] </ref>- where m slow u u u ( ) ( , ] = - + 1 2 30 60 m slow (u) denotes the degree of membership of u in term slow. <p> Instead, their primary concern is to discover all the patterns in the given databases [4, 11, 15]. To date, some studies have been performed on the interestingness problem <ref> [1, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15] </ref>. A number of interestingness measures have also been proposed. These measures can be classified into two classes: objective measures and subjective measures. Objective measures typically involve analyzing the discovered patterns structures, their predictive performances, and their statistical significance [4, 8, 12].

Reference-contexts: To prevent the user from being overwhelmed by the large number of patterns, techniques are needed to rank them according to their interestingness. So far, a number of papers have discussed the interestingness issue <ref> [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14] </ref>. The main factors that contribute to the interestingness of a discovered pattern have also been proposed. They include: coverage, confidence, strength, statistical significance, simplicity, unexpectedness, actionability [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12]. The first five factors are called objective measures [15]. <p> So far, a number of papers have discussed the interestingness issue [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14].

The first five factors are called objective measures [15]. They can be handled with techniques requiring no application and domain knowledge. They have been studied extensively in the literature [e.g., 12, 8]. <p> The last two 3 factors are called the subjective measures [11, 15], which measure the subjective interestingness of a pattern to the user. They are defined as follows: 1. Unexpectedness: Patterns are interesting if they are unexpected or previously unknown to the user <ref> [4] </ref>. 2. Actionability: Patterns are interesting if the user can do something with them to his/her advantage [4,11]. It has been noted in [13, 11] that although objective measures are useful in many respects, they are insufficient in determining the interestingness of the discovered patterns. Subjective measures are needed. <p> In order to identify and/or to rank the discovered patterns, it is obvious that the system must have a great deal of knowledge about the database, the application domain and the users interests at a particular time. To date a number of studies <ref> [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12, 156] </ref> have been conducted on the subjective interestingness issues and some systems have also been built [8, 11] with interestingness filtering components to help users focus on the useful patterns. However, these systems mostly handle the subjective interestingness in application/domain-specific fashions [15]. <p> The Proposed Technique This section describes the proposed method. Slightly different procedures are used for finding unexpected patterns and for finding actionable patterns. 3.1 Finding unexpected patterns and confirming users knowledge Patterns are unexpected if they are previously unknown to the user <ref> [4] </ref>. Unexpected patterns are, by definition, interesting because they provide new information to the user [4, 15]. Apart from finding unexpected patterns, sometimes the user also wishes to know whether his/her existing knowledge about the database is correct. <p> Slightly different procedures are used for finding unexpected patterns and for finding actionable patterns. 3.1 Finding unexpected patterns and confirming users knowledge Patterns are unexpected if they are previously unknown to the user [4]. Unexpected patterns are, by definition, interesting because they provide new information to the user <ref> [4, 15] </ref>. Apart from finding unexpected patterns, sometimes the user also wishes to know whether his/her existing knowledge about the database is correct. For these two purposes, the proposed method has the following two steps: 1. <p> Due to the interactive nature of the technique, he/she may try something simple at the beginning and slowly build up the set of expected patterns. 3.2 Finding actionable patterns Patterns are actionable if the user can do something with them to his/her advantage <ref> [4, 11] </ref>. The key here is the usefulness to the user. It has been recognized that many unexpected patterns are also actionable. Hence, the method presented above, in some sense, is also able to find some actionable patterns. <p> Then, without considering the final ranking which is basically a sorting process, the worst-case time complexity of the technique is O (|E||B|N 2 ). 17 7. Related Work Although the interestingness has long been identified as an important issue in data mining <ref> [4] </ref>, most of the data mining techniques and tools do not deal with this problem. Instead, their primary concern is to discover all the patterns in the given databases [4, 11, 15]. To date, some studies have been performed on the interestingness problem [1, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15]. <p> Related Work Although the interestingness has long been identified as an important issue in data mining [4], most of the data mining techniques and tools do not deal with this problem.

So far, a number of papers have discussed the interestingness issue <ref> [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14] </ref>. The main factors that contribute to the interestingness of a discovered pattern have also been proposed. They include: coverage, confidence, strength, statistical significance, simplicity, unexpectedness, actionability [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12]. The first five factors are called objective measures [15]. <p> C is the consequent, which has the same format as P i . However, its attr does not have to be an attribute name in the database. For example, in the C4.5 system <ref> [14] </ref>, Class is used for the consequent. The above representation is very common for classification patterns (rules) and association patterns. We now present the computational formulas used in the methods discussed in Section 3.1 and 3.2. 4.1.

They include: coverage, confidence, strength, statistical significance, simplicity, unexpectedness, actionability [e.g., 4, 8, 11, 12]. The first five factors are called objective measures <ref> [15] </ref>. They can be handled with techniques requiring no application and domain knowledge. They have been studied extensively in the literature [e.g., 12, 8]. The last two 3 factors are called the subjective measures [11, 15], which measure the subjective interestingness of a pattern to the user. <p> The first five factors are called objective measures [15].

The last two 3 factors are called the subjective measures <ref> [11, 15] </ref>, which measure the subjective interestingness of a pattern to the user. They are defined as follows: 1. Unexpectedness: Patterns are interesting if they are unexpected or previously unknown to the user [4]. 2. <p> However, these systems mostly handle the subjective interestingness in application/domain-specific fashions <ref> [15] </ref>. In this paper, we propose a general approach to determine the subjective interestingness (unexpectedness and actionability) of a discovered pattern. The technique is characterized by asking the user to specify a set of patterns according to his/her previous knowledge or intuitive feelings. <p> Slightly different procedures are used for finding unexpected patterns and for finding actionable patterns. 3.1 Finding unexpected patterns and confirming users knowledge Patterns are unexpected if they are previously unknown to the user [4]. Unexpected patterns are, by definition, interesting because they provide new information to the user <ref> [4, 15] </ref>. Apart from finding unexpected patterns, sometimes the user also wishes to know whether his/her existing knowledge about the database is correct. For these two purposes, the proposed method has the following two steps: 1. <p> Related Work Although the interestingness has long been identified as an important issue in data mining [4], most of the data mining techniques and tools do not deal with this problem. Instead, their primary concern is to discover all the patterns in the given databases <ref> [4, 11, 15] </ref>. To date, some studies have been performed on the interestingness problem [1, 4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15]. A number of interestingness measures have also been proposed. These measures can be classified into two classes: objective measures and subjective measures. <p> Instead, their primary concern is to discover all the patterns in the given databases [4, 11, 15].

Objective measures typically involve analyzing the discovered patterns structures, their predictive performances, and their statistical significance [4, 8, 12]. <p> Though domainspecific systems such as KEFIR are still the most effective method for ranking patterns and actions, the cost of building such a system is very high. <ref> [15] </ref> proposed to use probabilistic beliefs and belief revision as the framework for describing subjective interestingness. Specifically, a belief system is used for defining unexpectedness. A belief is represented as an arbitrary predicate formula. Associated with each belief is a confidence measure. <p> If a pattern contradicts the hard beliefs of the user, then this pattern is unexpected and interesting. The unexpectedness of a pattern is also defined with respect to a soft belief. However, <ref> [15] </ref> is just a proposal. No system has been implemented that utilizes this approach. For an actual implementation, a great deal of details have to be studied. [15] also does not handle pattern actionability.

Conclusion In this paper, we study the subjective interestingness issue in data mining from a domain independent perspective. A general method for ranking the discovered patterns according to their interestingness is proposed. An particular implementation has also been done.
