Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept that faults in telecommunications networks often manifest themselves as reductions in service quality, which can be addressed by using the notion of Quality of Service (QoS). In wireless ATM networks, the ability to provide QoS guarantees for high priority traffic in the presence of noise or faults is of utmost importance. Moreover, there is a need for renegotiating existing QoS on an established connection, since the characteristics of a wireless link may well change during the lifetime of a connection due to mobile hosts' movements or external interference. In this paper we describe a general QoS strategy as a fault tolerance mechanism, and address the problems associated with providing QoS over a wireless link. We present a QoS scheme with renegotiation capability, define an API (application programming interface) for the access to this scheme and describe our implementation for this QoS API on the SWAN system, a wireless ATM network, and summarize its performance using measurements obtained from a series of experiments based on different fault scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Fourth, for each VC, the application provides a callback routine which is used by the QoS manager to provide feedback as part of renegotiation. The QoS scheme described above is successfully implemented in a wireless ATM network: SWAN <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 The SWAN Environment Fig. 1: SWAN system architecture The SWAN (Seamless Wireless ATM Network) system, shown in Fig. 1, is a testbed for wireless networked computing. SWAN consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network [4].

Reference-contexts: Techniques involve replacing the faulty element, either using a hot standby or a warm standby or even accepting some downtime and repairing the unit off line. Existing traffic may also be rerouted via another redundant path from the source to its destination by routing algorithms <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. In telecommunications networks, fault tolerance has progressed to considering the recovery of failures such as reductions in the speed or capacity of a service. For instance, a telecom switch might reduce the maximum number of calls that can be handled if a processor failure is encountered.

Reference-contexts: Thus faults, rather than manifesting themselves as complete service failures, often manifest themselves as reductions in service quality such as reduced bandwidth or increased latency, e.g., due to rerouting. These problems can be addressed in the context of communications networks by using the notion of Quality of Service (QoS) <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: SWAN consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network <ref> [4] </ref>. Both the base stations and laptops are equipped with a radio interface known as the FAWN (Flexible Adapter for Wireless Networking) [13] card that allows them to communicate with each other wirelessly.

Reference-contexts: Wireless networks pose a more demanding set of challenges than in wired networks. Due to movement of mobiles, a fault-tolerant protocol for maintaining location directories in mobile networks is needed <ref> [9] </ref>. Furthermore, low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio makes wireless link er rors a norm rather than an exception in the system. The data rate does not drop immediately to zero; instead, it slowly reduces as noise increases.
