Abstract: A mathematical correctness analysis is given for a simple controlled vehicle acceleration maneuver in which the vehicle's response to controller inputs is subject to some uncertainty. The maneuver is modelled using hybrid (continuous/discrete) input/output automata. The analysis uses invariant assertion and levels of abstraction techniques. Levels of abstraction are used (a) to express the relationship between a derivative-based description of a system and an explicit description, and (b) to express the relationship between a system in which corrections are made at discrete sampling points and a system in which corrections are made continuously.
