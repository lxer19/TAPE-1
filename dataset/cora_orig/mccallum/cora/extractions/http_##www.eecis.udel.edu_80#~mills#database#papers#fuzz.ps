Abstract: The Fuzzball is an operating system and applications library designed for the PDP11 family of computers. It was intended as a development platform and research pipewrench for the DARPA/NSF Internet, but has occasionally escaped to earn revenue in commercial service. It was designed, implemented and evolved over a seventeen-year era spanning the development of the ARPANET and TCP/IP protocol suites and can today be found at Internet outposts from Hawaii to Italy standing watch for adventurous applications and enduring experiments. This paper describes the Fuzzball and its applications, including a description of its novel congestion avoidance/control and timekeeping mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: The resulting accuracy at the application interface is usually less than a millisecond in phase and less than a part per million in frequency. A timesynchronization function is built into the DCN routing protocol [12], which uses a variant of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. One or more DCN hosts synchronize to an external reference source, such as a radio clock or time daemon, and the routing protocol constructs a minimum-delay spanning tree rooted on these hosts. The clock offsets along the tree are then computed using timestamps included in routing-update messages.

Reference-contexts: All Backbone nodes include crystalstabilized clock interfaces, while one node (NCAR) is equipped with a WWVB radio time-code receiver providing a network time reference accurate to the order of a millisecond. The Backbone nodes function as Internet gateways <ref> [2] </ref> and include all the switching, monitoring, control and error-recovery functions necessary to forward packets from one regional Ethernet to another. Other gateways connect the Ethernets to regional and consortium networks, which in some cases span large regions of the country.

Reference-contexts: These gateways, acting as primary time servers, use NTP between them to cross-check the clocks and mitigate errors due to equipment or propagation failures. While multiple primary servers may exist, there is no requirement for an election protocol, such as used in some Unix systems <ref> [5] </ref>. In order to reduce the protocol overhead, some number of local-net hosts or gateways, acting as secondary time servers, can run NTP with one or more primary servers, then redistribute time to the remaining local-net hosts using NTP, DCN or some other protocol such as described in [9] and [5]. <p> <ref> [5] </ref>.

In the interest of reliability, selected local-net hosts can be equipped with less accurate but less expensive backup clocks and used in case of failure of the primary and/or secondary servers or communication paths between them.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Fuzzball is a software package consisting of a fast, compact operating system, support for the DARPA/NSF Internet architecture <ref> [8] </ref> and an array of application programs for network protocol development, testing and evaluation. It usually runs on a LSI-11 personal workstation, to which it also lends its name, and functions as a multipurpose packet switch, gateway and service host.

Reference-contexts: By 1977 the DCN system was dismantled and rebuilt in a leaner, zippier design and software was developed for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The DCN routing protocol, now called Hellospeak <ref> [12] </ref>, was completely redesigned to link DCN hosts and gateways together and to other networks, including ARPANET, SATNET and various LANs. <p> A particularly troublesome issue was the determination of retransmission timeout under conditions of moderate segment loss and path delays varying over several orders of magnitude. An extensive survey <ref> [12] </ref>, conducted with the aid of Fuzzballs used as network sounders, revealed the Internet had path delays and delay dispersions much larger than imagined. <p> The resulting accuracy at the application interface is usually less than a millisecond in phase and less than a part per million in frequency. A timesynchronization function is built into the DCN routing protocol <ref> [12] </ref>, which uses a variant of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm [1]. One or more DCN hosts synchronize to an external reference source, such as a radio clock or time daemon, and the routing protocol constructs a minimum-delay spanning tree rooted on these hosts.

Reference-contexts: This resulted in improved switching rates in the order of 200 packets/second. Meanwhile, the Fuzzballs were being used as experimental development platforms for the Gateway-Gateway Protocol (GGP) used in the BBN system, and later for the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) <ref> [13] </ref>. The goal of the experimental effort was to explore data-management techniques, protocol interoperability, routing algorithms and congestion control mechanisms. As the result of this exploration, the maximum switching rate of the Fuzzball (with LSI-11/73 processor) was improved to over 400 packets per second.

Reference-contexts: NSFNET consists of a large number of industry and academic campus and experimental networks, many of which are interconnected by a smaller number of regional and consortium networks. The NSFNET Backbone Network <ref> [15] </ref>, which is the primary means of interconnection between the regional networks, includes switching nodes located at six supercomputer sites and three regional interties. Additional nodes are used for program development and testing, bringing the total to about thirteen. <p> Furthermore, fairness in the form of equal access to system resources should be observed in order to avoid capture of excessive network resources by reckless hosts <ref> [15] </ref>. In an experiment designed to evaluate various realizations based on the above policies, the Fuzzball implementation was modified to incorporate comprehensive quench, preemption and service disciplines based on the specifications explicit and implicit in every IP datagram header. <p> The weight and threshold are chosen to begin triggering quenches when the mean queue size exceeds about one-half and reach maximum frequency (once quench per interval) when the mean queue size approaches two. As reported previously <ref> [15] </ref> there is no doubt the selective preemption scheme is highly effective in reducing the impact of bursts due to misengineered host implementations or profound speed mismatch at the entry points to the NSFNET Backbone.

Reference-contexts: interface presented by the emulator is a subset of that presented by the resident monitor of the RT-11 system and includes all of the programmed requests necessary to run standard RT-11 system compo nents and user programs. 2 A highly evolved logical clock is an intrinsic feature of the Fuzzball <ref> [16] </ref>. The logical clock increments at 1000 Hz and is equipped with frequency and phase control mechanisms useful for synchronizing time to other systems with either the Hellospeak routing protocol or Network Time Protocol mentioned later in this paper. <p> These algorithms were evolved under typical operating conditions over the last two years. A comprehensive description of the NTP architecture, protocol and algorithms is given in <ref> [16] </ref>. Timekeeping accuracies achieved with the Fuzzball implementation on typical Internet paths are in the range of a few tens of milliseconds. <p> There are presently six Fuzzball primary time servers located on the east coast, west coast and midcontinent, each of which serves 20-40 Fuzzball and Unix secondary time servers in the US and Europe. A survey reported in <ref> [16] </ref> suggests there may be well over 2000 potential clients in the ARPANET/MILNET community, plus probably several thousand more in the NSFNET community. 6.

Reference-contexts: It was used mostly to explore the features of the architecture, develop fast encoding and storage algorithms and verify interoperability of all implementations. One of the most interesting experiments using the Fuz-zballs involved the Domain Name System <ref> [17] </ref>, which is now in widespread use as a host name/address directory service. The system is based on a distributed, hierarchical data base and a set of structured lookup procedures that can be used in connection-oriented or connectionless modes.

Reference-contexts: This suggests an effective congestion policy should fairly distribute resources such as buffer space on the basis of originating host address. Congestion causes large queues, large delays, large delay dispersions and invites further abuse by undisciplined host retransmissions, even if heroic buffer space is available <ref> [18] </ref>. These observations suggest an effective congestion avoidance policy should be based on mean queue size and attempt to fairly equalize the sizes if more than one queue is present.
