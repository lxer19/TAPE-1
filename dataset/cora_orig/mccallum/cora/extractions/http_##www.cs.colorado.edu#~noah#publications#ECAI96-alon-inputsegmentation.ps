Title: Input Segmentation of Spontaneous Speech in JANUS: a Speech-to-speech Translation System  
Author: Alon Lavie Donna Gates, Noah Coccaro and Lori Levin 
Keyword: Speech Translation, Segmentation, Dialogue Units, Spontaneous Speech.  
Abstract: JANUS is a multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation system designed to facilitate communication between two parties engaged in a spontaneous conversation in a limited domain. In this paper we describe how multi-level segmentation of single utterance turns improves translation quality and facilitates accurate translation in our system. We define the basic dialogue units that are handled by our system, and discuss the cues and methods employed by the system in segmenting the input utterance into such units. Utterance segmentation in our system is performed in a multi-level incremental fashion, partly prior and partly during analysis by the parser. The segmentation relies on a combination of acoustic, lexical, semantic and statistical knowledge sources, which are described in detail in the paper. We also discuss how our system is designed to disambiguate among alternative possible input segmentations.

Reference-contexts: The source language input string is first analyzed by the GLR* parser [2][3]. Lexical analysis is provided by a morphological analyzer [4] based on Left Associative Morphology <ref> [1] </ref>. The parser uses a set of grammar rules in a unification-based formalism to produce a language-independent interlingua content representation in the form of a feature structure.

Reference-contexts: For speech synthesis, we use a commercially available speech synthesizer. At the core of the system are two separate translation modules which operate independently. The first is the Generalized LR (GLR) module, designed to be more accurate. The second is the Phoenix module <ref> [5] </ref>, designed to be more robust. Both modules follow an interlingua based approach. In this paper, we focus on the GLR translation module. The results that will be reported in this paper will be based on the performance of the GLR module except where otherwise noted.

Reference-contexts: The parser is designed to be robust over spontaneous speech in that it skips parts of the utterance that it cannot incorporate into a well-formed interlingua. After parsing, the inter-lingua is augmented and completed by the discourse processor <ref> [6] </ref> where it is also assigned a speech-act, and then passed to a generation component [7], which produces an output string in the target language. 3 Semantic Dialogue Units for Speech Translation Speech Translation in the JANUS system is guided by the general principle that spoken utterances can be analyzed and

Reference-contexts: The JANUS system is composed of three main components: a speech recognizer, a machine translation (MT) module and a speech synthesis module. The speech recognition component of the system is described elsewhere <ref> [8] </ref>. For speech synthesis, we use a commercially available speech synthesizer. At the core of the system are two separate translation modules which operate independently. The first is the Generalized LR (GLR) module, designed to be more accurate. The second is the Phoenix module [5], designed to be more robust.
