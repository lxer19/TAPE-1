Title: Causal diagrams for empirical research (with appendix on structural equations and counterfactuals)

Abstract: The primary aim of this paper is to show how graphical models can be used as a mathematical language for integrating statistical and subject-matter information. In particular, the paper develops a principled, nonparametric framework for causal inference, in which diagrams are queried to determine if the assumptions available are sufficient for identifying causal effects from nonexperimental data. If so the diagrams can be queried to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be queried to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be obtained. Key words: Causal inference, graph models, structural equations, treatment effect.

Reference-contexts: While the added arc Z ! X permits us to calculate bounds on P (yj^x) (Robins, 1989, Sec. 1g; Man-ski, 1990) and the upper and lower bounds may even coincide for certain types of distributions P (x; y; z) <ref> (Balke & Pearl, 1994) </ref>, there is no way of computing P (yj^x) for every positive distribution P (x; y; z), as required by Definition 4. In general, the addition of arcs to a causal diagram can impede, but never assist, the identification of causal effects in nonparametric models.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we seek to estimate P (x j j^x i ) from a sample estimate of P (V 0 ). The variables in V 0 nfX i ; X j g, are commonly known as concomitants <ref> (Cox, 1958, p. 48) </ref>. In observational studies, concomitants are used to reduce confounding bias due to spurious correlations between treatment and response. <p> The graphical criterion also enables the analyst to search for an optimal set of concomitants, namely, a set Z that minimizes measurement cost or sampling variability. 3.2 The front-door criteria Condition (i) of Definition 3 reflects the prevailing practice that "the concomitant observations should be quite unaffected by the treatment" <ref> (Cox, 1958, p. 48) </ref>. This 10 subsection demonstrates how concomitants that are affected by the treatment can be used to facilitate causal inference.

Reference-contexts: X from Y , in G, denoted (X k Y jZ) G , iff Z blocks every path from a node in X to a node in Y . 2 It can be shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of conditional independencies, X k Y jZ <ref> (Dawid, 1979) </ref>, implied by the recursive decomposition of Eq. (2) and the set of triples (X; Z; Y ) that satisfy the d-separation criterion in G (Geiger et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: The basic definition of causal effects in term of "wiping out" equations from the model (Definition 2) still carries over to nonrecursive systems (Strotz & Wold, 1960; Sobel, 1990), but then two issues must be addressed. First, the analysis of identification must ensure the stability of the remaining submodels <ref> (Fisher, 1970) </ref>. Second, the d-separation criterion for DAGs must be extended to cover cyclic graphs as well.

Reference-contexts: As a result, even such basic notions as "structural coefficients" or "missing links" become the object of serious controversy <ref> (Freedman, 1987) </ref> and conflicting interpretations (Wermuth, 1992; Whittaker, 1990, p. 302; Cox & Wermuth, 1993). To a large extent, this history of controversy and miscommunication stems from the absence of an adequate mathematical notation for defining basic notions of causal modeling.

Reference-contexts: a DAG G represents a deterministic function X i = f i (pa i ; * i ); i = 1; :::; n (3) where pa i are the parents of variable X i in G, and * i ; 1 i n, are mutually independent, arbitrarily distributed random disturbances <ref> (Pearl & Verma, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is commonly believed that if a concomitant Z is affected by the treatment, then it must be excluded from the analysis of the total effect of the treatment <ref> (Pratt & Schlaifer, 1988) </ref>. The reason given for the exclusion is that the calculation of total effects amounts to integrating out Z, which is functionally equivalent to omitting Z to begin with.

Reference-contexts: of variables Z satisfies the back-door criterion relative to (X; Y ), then the causal effect of X on Y is identifiable and is given by the formula P (yj^x) = z 2 Eq. (9) represents the directly standardized adjustment for concomitants Z when X is conditionally ignorable given Z <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>. Reducing ignor-ability conditions to the graphical criterion of Definition 3 replaces judgments about counterfactual dependencies with systematic procedures that can be applied to causal diagrams of any size and shape. <p> Diagrams (a) and (b) in Figure 7 contain no back-door paths between X and Y , and thus represent experimental designs in which there is no confounding bias between the treatment (X) and the response (Y ) (i.e., X is strongly ignorable relative to Y <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>; hence, P (yj^x) = P (yjx). Likewise, diagrams (c) and (d) in Figure 7 represent designs in which observed covariates, Z, block every back-door path between X and Y (i.e., X is conditionally ignorable given Z (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983); hence, P (yj^x) is obtained by standard <p> (Y ) (i.e., X is strongly ignorable relative to Y <ref> (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) </ref>; hence, P (yj^x) = P (yjx).

(9)): P (yj^x) = z 22 5.

Reference-contexts: d-separation has been established for nonrecursive linear models and extended, using an augmented graph, to any arbitrary set of stable equations 6 The testable implications of the model of Figure 6 (b) can be expressed in a simple inequality (Pearl, 1994c): max x y max z P (y; xjz) 1. <ref> (Spirtes, 1994) </ref>. However, the computation of causal effect estimands will be harder in cyclic networks, because symbolic reduction of P (yj^x) to hat-free expressions may require the solution of nonlinear equations. Finally, a few comments regarding the notation introduced in this paper.

According to many, the tobacco industry has managed to stay anti-smoking legislation by arguing that the observed correlation between smoking and lung cancer could be explained by some sort of carcinogenic genotype (U ) which involves inborn craving for nicotine.
