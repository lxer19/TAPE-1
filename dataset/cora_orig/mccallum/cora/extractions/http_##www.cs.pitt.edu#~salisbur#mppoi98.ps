Title: Multicast Control in Optical Circuit-Switched Banyan Networks  
Author: C. Salisbury and R. Melhem 
Address: Pittsburgh  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: Circuit-switching can be particularly useful in optical multiprocessor interconnection networks, where it may be desirable to provide all-optical connections. Circuit-switched Banyan networks can be built from simple switching elements that do not have logical processing or buffering capabilities. Distributed, dynamic control can be provided to establish circuits in the network in response to the changing needs of a parallel application. These control techniques interleave control and data in the same network, thus avoiding the need for a separate control network. When the switching elements provide broadcast connections, the control techniques can provide multicasting communication capabilities. Time division multiplexing (TDM) or wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) can be used to increase the number of data circuits provided and thus reduce the frequency of control operations.

Reference-contexts: If the switches can provide broadcast connections, the unicast techniques can be extended to provide multicast communications. In this paper we present the extended algorithm. Packet switched architectures handle multicast using techniques such as recirculation <ref> [1] </ref> or copy networks [5]. In contrast, a circuit switched network 1 may allow all branches of a multicast tree to be established simultaneously through the routing network, and the message to be transmitted to multiple destinations by exploiting the optical fan-out capabilities.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Several approaches have been suggested for constructing circuit-switched optical Banyan interconnection networks. Since logical operations and buffering are currently hard to perform in optics, some approaches place electronic logic in network switches which are interconnected optically [14]. Other approaches provide all-optical connections through either free space <ref> [3, 6] </ref> or optical fibers [15]. These approaches may use switches made of materials such as Lithium Niobate. Such switches are capable of changing state in a few nanoseconds in response to an external control signal.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a circuit switched network 1 may allow all branches of a multicast tree to be established simultaneously through the routing network, and the message to be transmitted to multiple destinations by exploiting the optical fan-out capabilities. There are two ways to handle the establishment of mul-ticast circuits <ref> [4] </ref>. In full multicast, all connections must be established or the multicast request fails completely. With partial multicast, if connections can be established to any subset of the intended destinations the request is considered to be at least partially successful.

Reference-contexts: To allow the control communication pattern to be implemented without blocking the network must be parti-tionable into contention-free and channel-balanced disjoint k-ary cubes, as described in <ref> [8] </ref>. The processors that must communicate in each step of the distributed procedure form a k-ary 1-cube. From [8], a cube banyan network (and by symmetry, the reverse cube network of Figure 1) has the required property. <p> To allow the control communication pattern to be implemented without blocking the network must be parti-tionable into contention-free and channel-balanced disjoint k-ary cubes, as described in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The source and destination nodes are labeled with n radix-k digits. The distributed algorithm for creating network states exploits the self-routing properties of a commonly used banyan structure called a Bi-Delta network <ref> [9] </ref>. The structure of a Bi-Delta network allows an efficient control communication pattern to be used to determine the required state of each switch. In addition, certain Bi-Delta architectures provide an efficient implementation of this pattern. <p> Delta networks are a class of banyan network having the property that the path descriptor for a destination node is a permutation of the n radix-k digits of the node address <ref> [9, 13] </ref>. Since the path descriptor is based entirely on the address of the destination node, the routing decision at each switch is independent of the port on which the message arrived, and hence independent of the address of the originating node. This property is known as self-routing.
