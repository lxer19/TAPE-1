Title: The Discrete 2-Center Problem  
Author: Pankaj K. Agarwal Micha Sharir Emo Welzl 
Date: July 18, 1997  
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing the discrete 2-center of a set P of n points in the plane; that is, computing two congruent disks of smallest possible radius, centered at two points of P , whose union covers P . Our algorithm runs in time O(n 4=3 log 5 n).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3.1 (n; m) = O (m 2=3 n 2=3 log 1=3 n + n log n). Discrete 2-Center July 18, 1997 11 The proof of the theorem is based on the random-sampling technique, and proceeds along the same lines as the proof by Clarkson et al. <ref> [4] </ref> for the bound on the complexity of many faces in an arrangement of lines in the plane. <p> We choose a random subset R D of size r, where each subset of size r is chosen with equal probability, Discrete 2-Center July 18, 1997 13 and consider the vertical decomposition A fl (R) of the arrangement A (R) <ref> [2, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Putting everything together, we obtain (D; P ) 2A fl (R) X n log n + O (r 2 ) X (m n + n log n) + O (r 2 ): Since R is a random subset of D, the random-sampling technique of Clarkson and Shor <ref> [5] </ref> implies that there exists R for which X n = O (nr); 2A fl (R) p r r : Substituting these values and choosing r = & n 1=3 log 2=3 n , we obtain K (n; m) = O (m 2=3 n 2=3 log 1=3 n + n log

Reference-contexts: This is a restricted version of the standard 2-center problem, where the centers of the two covering disks can be any pair of points in the plane.

Reference-contexts: Let J p be the set of indices of these canonical subsets (i.e., D p = S i2J p D (i) ).

Reference-contexts: However, this implies that D (q) (p) v intersect at least three times, contradicting the assumption that D is a set of pseudo-disks. This completes the proof. 2 The following corollary is an immediate consequence of the results of <ref> [10] </ref>: Corollary 2.7 In the setting of Theorem 2.6, if P has m points, then the boundary of S p2P K p consists of O (m) connected portions of the boundaries of the individual K p 's.

Reference-contexts: Given a point p, compute the leftmost and the rightmost points of K p . This requires computing the leftmost and the rightmost points of T j2J p I (j) . Reichling <ref> [13] </ref> has shown that the leftmost (or rightmost) point of the intersection of k convex polygons with a total of n vertices can be computed in time O (k log 2 n). In fact, his algorithm can also be applied to a family of intersections of congruent disks.
