Title: Complexity of Some Elementary Operations on Continued Fractions  
Author: Marek Teichmann 
Abstract: We consider the simple continued fractions representations of real numbers. Continued fractions are assumed to be streams of integers that represent the partial quotients. We analyze some unary and binary operations including homography, addition and multiplication, implemented as `filters'. These take as input one or two streams and produce a stream of partial quotients of the continued fraction of the result. We prove some bounds on the number of terms that are necessary to input to provide one term of output for the homography operation.

Reference-contexts: Here we assume that we are given the continued fractions as streams of numbers. Knuth [K81] describes an algorithm to compute the continued fraction of a homography in terms of an input continued fraction. Gosper <ref> [G72] </ref> generalizes this to include two inputs and allows the computation of the sum, difference, product and ratio of two continued fractions. Filter type algorithms can be viewed in the following general framework.

Reference-contexts: Gosper [G72] generalizes this to include two inputs and allows the computation of the sum, difference, product and ratio of two continued fractions. Filter type algorithms can be viewed in the following general framework. A similar one is described by Vuillemin <ref> [V90] </ref>: 1 They take as input terms of the input contined fraction, and output terms of the output contined fraction. We start out with no output and the continued fraction of x as input.
