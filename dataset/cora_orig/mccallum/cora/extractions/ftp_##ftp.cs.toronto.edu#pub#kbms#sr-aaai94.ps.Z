Abstract: In this paper we present a language for expressing "approximate" spatial relations on points and regions in space. Space is assumed to be two dimensional, orthogonal and discrete. Initially, we present a first-order theory of one-dimensional approximate space. We axiomatize the theory of space in terms of points and the haze and precedence relations. We then study the models of this theory and we show that in the one dimensional case the theory has a unique model up to isomorphism. This result allows us to affirm that our theory is complete and decidable. Secondly, we propose a conservative two-dimensional extension of the theory which retains its completeness property. In the two-dimensional case, we define a complete set of topological and directional relations that are useful for practical reasoning about space. The derived relations are related to existent formalisms for spatial relations such as Egen-hofer's 3-intersection model, for which they provide an alternative semantical account. The developed formalism is strictly qualitative with a built-in concept for imprecision. An axiomatization of varying the degree of detail is briefly discribed and discussed as a conclusion of the present work.

Reference-contexts: We know that both (Q; &lt;) and (Z; &lt;) theories are complete [vB91]. By Vaught's test for completeness, we also know that any countable categorical theory is complete; and by Robinson's test for completeness for non-countable models <ref> [Bri77] </ref>, the completeness condition requires the models to be elementary equivalent.

Reference-contexts: The ability to conceptualize the world at different granularities is fundamental in human intelligence. It is important to incorporate the same ability in the representations of space as well. Earlier representation models for approximate spatial knowledge such as [MD84], <ref> [Dav86] </ref> represented imprecision using interval values on measurements. [Dut91] defines a framework for approximate spatio-temporal knowledge using fuzzy set-theory semantics. Finally, qualitative representations provide a promising response to this problem [Her92], [Ran92], [Ege91]. * The most successful computational paradigms base their success on their mathematical clarity.

Reference-contexts: The approaches found in the literature are charecterized by a wide diversity. AI reseachers debate whether a Euclidean fl To appear in the AAAI-94 Workshop on Spatial and Temporal Reasoning, Seattle, Washington or non-Euclidean ontology would suit the needs of spatial reasoning problems encountered in commonsense reasoning <ref> [Dav90] </ref>. Database and GIS researchers develop point-based on point-set based spatial data models, and spatial relations pertaining to logical, algebraic or fuzzy seman tics [GB90]. * Spatial knowledge is approximate in its nature. Spatial relations are perceived in relation to the degree of detail that the world is viewed.
