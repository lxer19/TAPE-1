Abstract: Multicast distribution in mobile wireless networks is a topic that has recently begun to be explored. For multicasting, conventional protocols define a multicast group as a collection of hosts which register to a multicast group address. However, in this paper, we define a location-based multicast group which is based on a specific region ("Multicast Region") in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Hosts within the multicast region at a given time form the multicast group at that time. We present two algorithms for delivering packets to such a multicast group, and present simulation results.

Reference-contexts: Location information used in our protocol may be provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) [2, 3, 11, 20]. Current GPS provides accurate three-dimensional position (latitude, longitude, and altitude), velocity, and precise time traceable to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) <ref> [1] </ref>.

In selective paging, the system pages a selected subset of cells close to the last reported location of a mobile host.

Reference-contexts: Such a multicast group may be used for sending a message that is likely to be of interest to everyone at a given location (or in a specified area). Most existing multicast protocols which have been developed for wired networks <ref> [7, 10] </ref> cannot be directly applied to the environment of MANET. For instance, source-oriented protocols such as DVMRP [10] would be inefficient because source nodes also can move in mobile ad hoc networks.

Reference-contexts: When an application must send the same information to more than one destination, multicasting is often used. Multicasting has played an important role in supporting multimedia applications, such as audio/video broadcasting. Multicasting is much more advantageous than multiple unicasts as it reduces the communication costs <ref> [8] </ref>. Cost considerations are all the more important for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consisting of mobile hosts that communicate with each other over wireless links, in the absence of a fixed infrastructure 1 [15, 21].

Reference-contexts: In addition, an easily reconfigurable multicast tree topology is required since it can be dynamically changed by movement of group members. However, unfortunately, channel overhead caused by tree reconfiguration updates tends to increase very rapidly with mobility <ref> [9] </ref>. Sometimes, multicast flooding may be a better solution in MANET. In this paper, we propose two Location-based Multicast schemes to decrease delivery overhead of multicast packets, as compared to multicast flooding. The schemes in this paper attempt to reduce the forwarding space for multicast packets.
