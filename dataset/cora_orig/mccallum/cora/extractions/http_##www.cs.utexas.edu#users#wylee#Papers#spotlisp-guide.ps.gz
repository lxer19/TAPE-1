Reference-contexts: Introduction The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin has acquired two mobile robots for research purposes, specifically for research in mobile robot exploration, mapping and navigation using the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy representation of spatial knowledge [Kuipers and Levitt, 1988] <ref> [Kuipers and Byun, 1988] </ref> [Lee, 1994]. One of the mobile robot is developed locally which we named Rover, while the other is a commercial mobile robot from Real World Interface TM (RWI) which we named Spot.
