Abstract: Robotics is one of the most challenging applications of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It is characterized by direct interaction with a real world, sensory feedback and an enormous complexity of the control system. In recent years several approaches to apply ML to specific robotics tasks have been published. Nevertheless we are still far from a complete autonomous robot control system with learning components. This paper aims at pointing out the problems and possible applications for integrating learning capabilities into a robot control system and then describes a new integrated system architecture which shows up a set of components necessary for (partially) autonomous systems with learning facilities.

Reference-contexts: First, try to transform the result of a planning task according to new needs <ref> [5] </ref>. Second, build up a set of action rules which determine an appropriate action with respect to the current context. Though the first way should later guide the planning phase by leading to some skeletal goals, our approach now is mainly based on the second method.

Reference-contexts: These visual descriptions will be enhanced later by results of experimentation (e.g. mass, center of gravity, face normals). Several descriptions of one view of a type of objects are then combined into a generic description by using an algorithm based on ideas of the conceptual clustering algorithm CLASSIT <ref> [11] </ref>. We extended the algorithm so that it is able to handle relational attributes in the matching step.

Reference-contexts: For early experiments we developed a ML-Library containing several standard inductive learning algorithms (AQR, CN2, ID3, ID5R, COBWEB, CLASSIT). Results of a comparison of these algorithms on a common problem set were published in <ref> [14] </ref>. We apply our concept to the acquisition of object knowledge and then the grasping and manipulation of these objects from own experiments and by user guidance.
