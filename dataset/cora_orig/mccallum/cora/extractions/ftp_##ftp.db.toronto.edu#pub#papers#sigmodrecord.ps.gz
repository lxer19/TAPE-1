Abstract: In this paper, we present visualizations of parts of the network of documents comprising the World Wide Web. We describe how we are using the Hy + visualization system to visualize the portion of the World Wide Web explored during a browsing session. As the user browses, the web browser communicates the URL and title of each document fetched as well as all the anchors contained in the document. Hy + displays graphically the history of the navigation and multiple views of the structure of that portion of the web.

Reference-contexts: WebViz [PK94] is a system for server access log analysis through visualization, developed at the Graphics Visualization & Usability Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It provides graphical information about document accesses and possible paths taken by users through a set of documents.

Reference-contexts: We maintain a database with connectivity and other information about portions of the web and we use standard database functionality <ref> [CEH + 94] </ref> and standard visualization techniques [DETT94, Noi96] to produce the overview diagrams. <p> of the web browser with Hy + , Section 3 presents some typical overview diagrams created by our system, and Section 4 discusses related work. 2 Interfacing Hy + to a Web Browser The Hy + visualization system supports the visual presentation of structured data in the form of hygraphs <ref> [CEH + 94] </ref>. It provides a number of browsers and graphical editors to display and create the graphical presentations, and incorporates a layout engine that implements several different layout algorithms [Noi96]. Most important, Hy + supports a visual query language, called GraphLog [CM90], which allows visual query specification.

Most important, Hy + supports a visual query language, called GraphLog <ref> [CM90] </ref>, which allows visual query specification. GraphLog queries allow systematic filtering of data to reduce visual complexity, and support specification of new relationships among the data in much the same way as database views. We have interfaced the Hy + visualization system with the Mosaic 2.0 web browser [HMV95].
