Abstract: This chapter presents a technique to determine the identity of objects in a scene using multidimensional histograms of the responses of a vector of local linear neighborhood operators (receptive fields). This technique can be used to determine the most probable objects in a scene, independent of the object's position, image-plane orientation and scale. The first part of the chapter summarizes the mathematical foundations of multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms [1] and gives a recognition example on a database of 103 objects. The second part of the chapter describes experiments to evaluate the robustness of multidimensional receptive field histograms to view point changes, using the Columbia image database [2]. In this experiment we examine the performance of different filter combinations, histogram matching functions and design parameter of the multidimensional histograms.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In <ref> [1] </ref> we generalized the color histogram approach of Swain and Ballard [3] to the use of Multiple Receptive Field Histograms. The main idea of the approach is to calculate a multi-dimensional histogram of the response of a vector of receptive fields. <p> An object in an image can be identified by matching the multi-dimensional histogram from a region of the image with a histogram of the sample of the object. In <ref> [1] </ref> we have shown that the technique can be used to identify objects in the presence of image plane rotation and scale. <p> However, its reliance on object color and (to a lesser degree) light source intensity make it inappropriate for many recognition problems. The focus of our work has been to develop a similar technique using local descriptions of an object's shape provided by a vector of linear receptive fields <ref> [1] </ref>. For the Swain and Ballard algorithm, it can be seen that robustness to scale and rotation are provided by the use of color. Robustness to changes in viewing angle and to partial occlusion are due to the use of histogram matching. <p> Thus it is natural to exploit the power of histogram matching to perform recognition based on histograms of local shape properties. The most general method to measure such properties is the use of a vector of linear local neighborhood operations, or receptive fields. In <ref> [1] </ref> we have compared sensitivity and recognition reliability for a variety of local neighborhood operations. Throughout the chapter we will use only the most successful functions. <p> A further advantage of the use of the histogram of receptive field vectors for recognition is that neither segmentation, nor an explicit geometric model of an object is needed. An object class is described by the histogram of its local characteristics. The experiments presented below and in <ref> [1] </ref> demonstrate that this technique can be used to discriminate arbitrary objects at different scales and orientations. This chapter has three parts: The first part presents our generalization of the color histogram method (section 2., see also [1]). <p> The experiments presented below and in <ref> [1] </ref> demonstrate that this technique can be used to discriminate arbitrary objects at different scales and orientations. This chapter has three parts: The first part presents our generalization of the color histogram method (section 2., see also [1]). In the second part (section 6.) we give the results of an recognition experiment on a database of 103 objects. In the third part of the chapter we examine the robustness of the approach under view point changes. <p> The experiments also show that we can use low resolution for each axis of a receptive field histogram and still obtain high recognition rates. Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms 3 2. Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms In <ref> [1] </ref> we did identify three main parameters of the multidimensional receptive field histogram approach: * The choice of local property measurements or the receptive field functions. <p> In section 3. we will describe several local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives, which we use throughout the chapter. * Measurement for the comparison of the histograms. In <ref> [1] </ref> we summarized that 2 and "intersection" are the most suitable comparison measurements. Section 4. defines them. * Design parameter of the histograms: number of dimensions of the histogram (each axis corresponds to one local property) and resolution of each axis (number of bins per axis). <p> Equivariant means that they vary in a uniform manner which is represented by a translation in a parameter space. We also describe two rotation invariant characteristics, namely the magnitude of the first Gaussian derivative and the Laplace operator. As we saw in the experiments in <ref> [1] </ref>, the comparison measurement determines the separability between histograms. The two best measures (of the experiments in [1]) for the histogram comparison are introduced in section 4.. In the experiments (see section 7.) we will examine the robustness of these comparison measurements under view point changes. <p> We also describe two rotation invariant characteristics, namely the magnitude of the first Gaussian derivative and the Laplace operator. As we saw in the experiments in <ref> [1] </ref>, the comparison measurement determines the separability between histograms. The two best measures (of the experiments in [1]) for the histogram comparison are introduced in section 4.. In the experiments (see section 7.) we will examine the robustness of these comparison measurements under view point changes. The experiments described in this chapter examine the dependency of the robustness to 3D-rotation and the design parameter of the histograms. <p> As normalization function we are using the Energie normalization function, which is described in section 3.2.. This normalization has been shown to be the most robust in the presence of additive Gaussian noise <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1. Local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives As stated in [1], it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this chapter we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. <p> As normalization function we are using the Energie normalization function, which is described in section 3.2.. This normalization has been shown to be the most robust in the presence of additive Gaussian noise <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1. Local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives As stated in [1], it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this chapter we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. As described above the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [1] for further receptive field functions as i.e. <p> Local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives As stated in <ref> [1] </ref>, it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this chapter we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. As described above the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [1] for further receptive field functions as i.e. Gabor filter). By using the Gaussian derivatives one can explicitly select the scale. This is achieved by adapting the variance of the derivative. <p> Normalization should be considered from at least two points of view. The first point concerns how well the normalized convolution behaves in the presence of additive noise (see experiments in <ref> [1] </ref>). The second point concerns how the normalized convolution responds to variations in signal intensity due to differences in ambient light intensity, aperture setting or digitizer gain. <p> We have compared the robustness of no normalization to three forms of normalization: Normalization by MaxMin, Normalization by Energie and Normalization by Variance (see <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> Histogram Comparison Measurements For object recognition using receptive field histograms we compare a histogram T from a database to a newly observed histogram H. Possible similarity measures can be drawn from signal processing as well as from statistics. In <ref> [1] </ref> we concluded that the best measurements to compare histograms are the "intersection"-measurement of Swain and Ballard and the 2 distance, which we will introduce in the following. 4.1. 2 test The proper method proposed by mathematical statistics for the comparison of two histograms is the 2 -test. 2 is used <p> Although we do not know the theoretical distribution in the general case, we have found that 2 T works well in practice: 2 (H (i; j) T (i; j)) 2 (11) The second calculation 2 T H compares two real histograms. As we know from the results of <ref> [1] </ref> the following 2 T H gives more reliable results: 2 (H (i; j) T (i; j)) 2 (12) 6 schiele and crowley 4.2. <p> Therefore we will have only one image for one object and will generalize from this image to all considered scales and 2D rotations (see experiments in <ref> [1] </ref>). In this chapter we do consider view point changes (3D-rotation). The experiments described below examines the robustness of the approach to these rotations. The histograms themselves are invariant with respect to translation of the image or the object, since position information is completely removed. <p> Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms 7 To test robustness in relation to noise we completed a series of experiments with artificial and real images, where we added Gaussian noise. The impact on the histograms (measured with an appropriate distance measure) are shown in <ref> [1] </ref>. 5.2. Application for Object Recognition This section describes an illustration of the use of multidimensional receptive field histograms for object recognition. The system we describe is only an initial experiment to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for object recognition. <p> In these figures 5 through 8 we can observe a graceful degradation of the recognition rate, which indicates the desired robustness of the approach to view point changes. 12 schiele and crowley between recognition rate and ff (see text). between recognition rate and ff (see text). 8. Conclusion In <ref> [1] </ref> we have shown how the color histogram matching technique of Swain and Ballard can be generalized to use vectors of local image properties measured by normalized convolution with local receptive fields.

Intersection Swain and Ballard <ref> [3] </ref> used the following intersection value to compare two color-histograms: "(H; T ) = i;j min (H (i; j); T (i; j)) (13) The advantage of this measurement is, that background pixels are explicitly neglected when they don't occur in the Model histogram T (i; j). <p> The histograms themselves are invariant with respect to translation of the image or the object, since position information is completely removed. Furthermore the histogram matching is relatively immune to minor occlusions. This was demonstrated by Swain and Ballard in the original work on color histograms <ref> [3] </ref>. Signal intensity variations are accommodated by the use of energy normalized convolution with robust filters such as Gabor filters and Gaussian derivatives.
