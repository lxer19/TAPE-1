Title: Linux Device Driver Emulation in Mach  
Author: Shantanu Goel and Dan Duchamp 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Columbia University  
Abstract: We describe the design and performance of code added to the Mach microkernel (Mach 4.0, version UK02p21) that permits one to build a Mach kernel that includes unmodified Linux device drivers. We have written emulation code to support all Linux 1.3.35 network and SCSI drivers for the ISA and PCI I/O buses. Emulation increases latency, but very little. The degree depends on both device and operation, and varies from 2 microseconds for receiving small (60 byte) network packets up to 197 microseconds for writing 16KB to an ISA SCSI device.

Reference-contexts: Of course within the last few years there has been a good deal of work in the UNIX community on emulating the system calls of the far more popular DOS and Windows interfaces; examples include Mach's DOS server <ref> [2] </ref>, Linux "DOSemu" and "Wine" projects, and a number of commercial efforts such as "DOSMerge" and "WABI." The difference between those efforts and ours is that we include another system's source code into our kernel, so we are emulating intra-kernel variables and interfaces rather than the more standardized and carefully considered
