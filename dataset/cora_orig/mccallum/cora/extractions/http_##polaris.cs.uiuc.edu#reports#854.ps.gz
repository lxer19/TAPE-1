Abstract: We propose new parallel algorithms for the solution of linear parabolic problems. The first of these methods is based on using polynomial approximation to the exponential. It does not require solving any linear systems and is highly paral-lelizable. The two other methods proposed are based on Pade and Chebyshev approximations to the matrix exponential. The parallelization of these methods is achieved by using partial fraction decomposition techniques to solve the resulting systems and thus offers the potential for increased time parallelism in time dependent problems. We also present experimental results from the Alliant FX/8 and the Cray Y-MP/832 vector multiprocessors.

Reference-contexts: This can lead 10 to a fairly involved procedure, requiring the use of a Remez type algorithm. We preferred instead to use directly the very accurate values from <ref> [1] </ref>, where the polynomial coefficients are provided for up to the degree 30. Once these coefficients are input, we proceed as before, calling a polynomial rootfinder and evaluating the partial fraction coefficients. <p> is Hermitian, a relation of the form kw (t) w m;r k 2 fl m;r kw 0 A 1 rk 2 8t 0 holds, where w m;r is the solution computed with an (m; r) order Chebyshev approximation, and fl m;r are constants converging to zero geometrically (see [3] and <ref> [1] </ref> for a list of fl r;r 's). Although such a technique will have its limitations for time-varying coefficients and boundary conditions, it can often produce excellent results as is demonstrated in our experiments. <p> The program asks for the type (Pade or Chebyshev) and order of the diagonal rational approximation. In the Pade case, the coefficients of the numerator and denominator polynomials in the rational function are numerically evaluated from (4.8). In the Chebyshev case the coefficients are taken directly from <ref> [1] </ref>. Subsequently, the IMSL routine zrpoly (based on the Jenkins-Traub algorithm) is used to compute the roots and poles of the rational approximation. The partial fraction coefficients are then computed from (4.7). The new solution is found by solving the independent complex tridiagonal systems in parallel and combining the results. <p> The dimension n was chosen to be 98. Diagonal approximation was used throughout (m = r). When m = 1 real arithmetic was used. The objective was to integrate from 0 to T 2 <ref> [1; 1 + t] </ref> so that the maximum error (kerrork 1 ) at T is less than * = 10 9 . The optimal t op is the maximum t which achieves error tolerance * at T .

Reference-contexts: when A is Hermitian, a relation of the form kw (t) w m;r k 2 fl m;r kw 0 A 1 rk 2 8t 0 holds, where w m;r is the solution computed with an (m; r) order Chebyshev approximation, and fl m;r are constants converging to zero geometrically (see <ref> [3] </ref> and [1] for a list of fl r;r 's).

Reference-contexts: The final result is the desired solution. One then needs to multiply the result by p m (A). In fact, several modifications to the aforementioned scheme have been proposed in the literature to avoid this last extra step <ref> [4] </ref>. Incidentally, we should mention that partial fraction expansion formulations can be used to explain many of these efficient implementations of time stepping procedures. This is discussed in the note [6]. Clearly, a significant difficulty with the use of (4.5) is that it is a sequential process.

Numerical experiments. In this section we will describe a few tests to illustrate the behavior of the schemes described in this paper. In particular we do not compare here the polynomial approach with the rational approximation approach. Further experiments will be presented in a forthcoming report.

System number i must be solved before system i + 1 since its solution will be the right hand side of the next system. An alternative approach used in <ref> [7] </ref> in a different context is to resort to the partial fraction expansion of (4.2), namely, R m;r (z) = r r X ff i (4.6) where ff i = q 0 (4.7) and m and r are the leading coefficients of the polynomials p m and q r respectively.

Reference-contexts: Previous work. The previous discussion underscores the direct connection that exists between the topic of this paper and that of of parallel solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As argued in <ref> [8] </ref>, the most important situation when considering parallel methods for solving systems of ODE's is when the problem is very large, as is the case for systems resulting from a method of lines semi-discretization of a partial differential equation such as (1.1).

Reference-contexts: Each quadratic factor corresponds to a product of the form (x i )(x i ) for all roots of the denominator having non-zero imaginary parts. This is just a case of incomplete partial fraction decomposition (see <ref> [9, Section 7.1] </ref>). Some drawbacks to this technique are the need to form A 2 , the extra computations due to the first order expansion coefficients and the need to store the quadratic factors.

Compute x = m r v + i=1 ff i x i : Note that for the usual approach, schemes with repeated poles (e.g. the restricted schemes <ref> [14] </ref>) have often been preferred because they involve fewer factorizations with the standard techniques when direct methods are used. These factorizations are very expensive for 2-D and 3-D problems. These schemes cannot be used with our approach since we need to have distinct poles.

Reference-contexts: We note that the idea of exploiting the Lanczos algorithm to evaluate terms of the exponential of Hamiltonian operators has been extensively used in Chemistry ([25]).

Reference-contexts: f (z) = (1 e z )=z we can rewrite the solution (1.2) as follows: w (t) = e tA w 0 + f (tA)tr This removes the term A 1 r from the expression (1.2), at the expense of dealing with the function f (z) instead of e z <ref> [22] </ref>. The above expression also shows more clearly the dependence of the solution with respect to the initial condition w 0 and the forcing function r. Assume now that instead of attempting to compute the solution at time t in one single step, we use a time-stepping procedure. <p> This approximation is local, i.e., it is very accurate near the origin but may be inaccurate far away. For this reason schemes based on more global approximation have been devised <ref> [22, 2] </ref>. <p> More precisely, the coefficients j ; j = 0; :::; m of the polynomial p m and j ; j = 0; :::; r of the polynomial q r are explicitly given by <ref> [22] </ref>: j = (1) j (r + m j)!m! ; j = 0; : : :m (m + r j)!r! ; j = 0; : : :r:(4.8) Then we need to compute the roots of the denominator. This we do by some standard polynomial rootfinder.

Reference-contexts: An example of the better behavior of Pade for small steps can be seen in Figure 4, where t = 0:0005 to 0:01. We note that there exist techniques to avoid this error behavior of Chebyshev approximation <ref> [23] </ref>. To test the performance of rational approximation method we used the 1-dimensional problem but with u (0; x j ) taken to be the j th component sin j n+1 of the eigenvector of A corresponding to the eigenvalue of smallest modulus.

Reference-contexts: These complex shifts come in conjugate pairs and correspond to complex poles of the rational function under consideration, that is the roots of the (real) denominator. Similar problems occur elsewhere in linear algebra, e.g. in the course of the QR algorithm <ref> [24, Section 41] </ref>. Since the coefficients of the corresponding principal parts in the partial fraction expansion also have conjugate coefficients, complex arithmetic can be avoided completely by writing the rational function as a sum of fractions whose denominators can contain quadratic factors.
