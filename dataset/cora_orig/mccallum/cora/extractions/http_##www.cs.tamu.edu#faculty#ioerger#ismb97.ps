Title: The Context-Dependence of Amino Acid Properties

Abstract: One of the current limitations of using sequence alignments to identify proteins with similar structures is that some proteins with similar structures do not have significant sequence similarity by identity. One way to address this "hidden-homology" problem is to match amino acids based on their chemical and physical properties. However, the amino acid properties overlap, creating orthogonal dimensions of similarity, the relative strengths of which are ambiguous. It has been observed that the role an amino acid plays (and hence the property that is important) at a site in a protein depends on its secondary and tertiary environment. To approximate and take advantage of this dependence on context for improving the sensitivity of alignments of proteins whose structures are unknown, we propose a surrogate definition of context based on the pattern of hydropathy in a small window of contiguous neighbors surrounding each amino acid. We present the results of an experiment in which a search-based program iteratively tests and selects various properties in independent contexts, and incrementally increases the ability of sequence alignments to detect relationships among distantly-related proteins. The method is shown to perform better than using the MDM78 substitution table for partial match scores.

Reference-contexts: A match is indicated when the alignment produces a score significantly higher than for random alignments (Doolittle 1981), and the alignment can then be used as a basis for constructing a model of the new protein <ref> (Blundell et al. 1987) </ref>. However, sometimes proteins with similar structures do not have significantly high sequence identity (e.g. the wide variety of distinct beta-barrels; Chothia 1988).

Reference-contexts: Of course, this secondary and tertiary context information may not be available if the structures of neither protein in the alignment are known. Although approaches such as 3D-1D profiling <ref> (Bowie, Luthy, & Eisenberg 1991) </ref> can use known protein structures to greatly enhance alignments, there are still many cases in which alignments must be done without the aid of structure information. <p> Clearly, knowledge of at least one of the protein structures involved would greatly facilitate making decisions about the appropriateness of amino acid matches, as in methods like 3D-1D profiling <ref> (Bowie, Luthy, & Eisenberg 1991) </ref>. There are many ways to extend the experiment described in this paper. First, our definition of context was both limited and static. The size of the window of neighbors could be extended, and other properties besides the hydophobicity of these residues could be considered.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge-based approach contrasts with other methods, such as using Bayesian techniques to calculate prior weights for mixtures of similarity scales that best explain a set of amino acids observed at a site <ref> (Brown et al. 1993) </ref>. In our experiments, we used biochemical knowledge to choose a particular definition of context that we believed would be useful in separating sites with distinct substitution patterns, and to choose a particular set of properties that we expected might be relevant.

Reference-contexts: Comparison to MDM78 To assess the importance of this improvement in sensitivity, we also computed the average Z-score for alignments constructed using the MDM78 substitution table, which is one of the most widely used methods for improving sequence alignment algorithms <ref> (Dayhoff, Schwartz, & Orcutt 1978) </ref>. The average Z-scores on the test sets for each run of cross-validation are also shown in Table 2. 3 The MDM78 method produced an average Z-score of 5.597 over all 10 runs, an increase of +0.382 (shown by the upper horizontal line in Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: Typically, related proteins are identified by aligning a new protein with the amino acid sequences of proteins in a protein database. A match is indicated when the alignment produces a score significantly higher than for random alignments <ref> (Doolittle 1981) </ref>, and the alignment can then be used as a basis for constructing a model of the new protein (Blundell et al. 1987). However, sometimes proteins with similar structures do not have significantly high sequence identity (e.g. the wide variety of distinct beta-barrels; Chothia 1988).

Reference-contexts: Data In these experiments, we used a set of 199 proteins, representing a range of ff, fi, ff + fi, and ff=fi structures (see <ref> (Ioerger 1996) </ref> for a list of the proteins, including their chain identifiers and sequence limits). The amino acid sequences were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB; Bernstein et al. 1977). They ranged in length from 39 residues (4gcr) to 478 residues (2taa).

Reference-contexts: The apparent conservation of these properties during evolution suggests that they play an important role in protein structure. Many other properties of the amino acids have been proposed and studied <ref> (see the extensive listing in Nakai, Kidera, & Kanehisa 1988) </ref>. Reasonable groupings of amino acids that are slight variants of Day-hoff's exchange groups have been investigated (Sander & Schulz 1979; Taylor 1986).

Reference-contexts: The amino acid sequences were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB; Bernstein et al. 1977). They ranged in length from 39 residues (4gcr) to 478 residues (2taa). These proteins have been assigned to 37 distinct fold classes by visual inspection <ref> (Pascarella & Argos 1992) </ref>, with at least two proteins per fold. Many proteins in the same fold class had low homology: over 50% of such pairs had less than 25% sequence identity.

Reference-contexts: For example, in fi-sheets, neighbors i 2 contact the central residue, and in ff-helices, neighbors i 3 and i 4 in the previous loop and i + 3, and i + 4 in the subsequent loop often make contact with the central amino acid at position i <ref> (Schulz & Schirmer 1979) </ref>. Residues that contact the side-chain of the central residue at a site participate in its tertiary environment, and because of their sequential locality, they usually participate in the same secondary structure as well.

Reference-contexts: These contextual factors have a significant influence on the rates of substitution between the amino acids. The acceptability of various amino acids at a site has been observed to correlate with the polarity of contacting chemical groups, as well as conserving hydrogen-bonding patterns <ref> (Warme & Mor-gan 1978) </ref>. Ponnuswamy et al. (1980) found that the average level of hydrophobicity among surrounding residues (in 3D space) has a strong effect on the distribution of amino acids at a given site.
