Reference-contexts: A characteristic description would include also properties such as have four legs, have no back, have four corners, etc. Discriminant descriptions are typically much shorter than characteristic descriptions. 3. Discovering Attribute Dependence An application of our methodology is done on two distinct databases, the wind bracing <ref> (Arciszewski, et al, 1992) </ref> and the accident data (Arciszewski, et al, 1992). Four different strategies were done on each set of data to show the effect of each strategy on the performance of the discovery. All the strategies are based on the inductive learning system AQ15 (Michalski, et al., 1986). <p> Discriminant descriptions are typically much shorter than characteristic descriptions. 3.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm can work with just a few examples or with very many examples. The learned descriptions are represented in the form of a set of decision rules (a ruleset) expressed in an attributional logic calculus, called variable-valued logic (VL1) <ref> (Michalski, 1973) </ref>. A distinctive feature of this representation is that it employs, in addition to standard logic operators, the internal disjunction operator (a disjunction of values of the same attribute), which can significantly simplify rules involving multivalued attributes.

Reference-contexts: The method uses the AQ algorithm, which is an implementation of the STAR methodology <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref>. The algorithm starts with a seed example of a given decision class, and generates a set of the most general conjunctive descriptions of the seed (decision rules). Such a set is called a star of this seed. <p> A discriminant description states only the properties that discriminate a given concept from a fixed set of other concepts. The most desirable is a rule with the shortest condition part <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref>. For example, to distinguish a given set of tables from a set of chairs, one may only need to indicate that tables have large flat top. A characteristic description would include also properties such as have four legs, have no back, have four corners, etc.

Reference-contexts: This paper addresses the problem of integrating statistical and conceptual methods. It presents a new strategy for determining irrelevant attributes (for any given users goal) in a large database. The method uses an inductive learning technique AQ15 <ref> (Michalski et. al, 1986) </ref> for generating conceptual descriptions and calculating the "importance score" for each input attribute. It also uses the Chisquare test to compute correlation among the input and output attributes. <p> The program determines decision rules characterizing the dependence between the reduced set of input attributes and the output attribute. 2. A Brief Description of the AQ15 Rule Learning Program In order to make the paper self-contained, we briefly describe the system, AQ15 <ref> (Michalski et al., 1986) </ref> that learns decision rules for a given set of decision classes from examples. The method uses the AQ algorithm, which is an implementation of the STAR methodology (Michalski, 1983). <p> Four different strategies were done on each set of data to show the effect of each strategy on the performance of the discovery. All the strategies are based on the inductive learning system AQ15 <ref> (Michalski, et al., 1986) </ref>. The wind bracing data contains a decision attribute representing the structural worth of the buildings with four values (i.e. four decision classes) high (c1), medium (c2), low (c3) and infeasible (c4).
