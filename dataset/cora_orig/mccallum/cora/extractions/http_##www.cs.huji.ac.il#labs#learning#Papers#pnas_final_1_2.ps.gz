The model produced can also be used to impose temporal segmentation on the data. In the present context the observations are the recorded neural spike-trains, whereas it is claimed that the emerging states correspond to some underlying organization of the local cortical activity. <p> METHODS OF ANALYSIS The vector of parallel recorded spike trains was regarded as the output of an HMM. Given the number of hidden states, the parameters of the model are the Markov state transition probabilities and the joint distribution of the spike trains at each hidden state <ref> [8, 10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a well known technique of stochastic modeling used so far mostly for speech and handwriting recognition <ref> [9] </ref>. Within this model, the observations are considered as stochastic functions of a Markov process whose states are "hidden", i.e. not directly observable. <p> This was done for both the GO and the NO-GO modes. Each trial, in its turn, was excluded from the training data and then its likelihood under the 4 models was evaluated <ref> [9] </ref>. When the obtained likelihood was highest for the model trained in the appropriate category, we considered the classification successful. The data included only four seconds of activity which followed the visual cue, and preceded the monkeys' response.

Reference-contexts: Our results show that not only is such treatment possible, but that it yields states which are specific to the external events and to their behavioral significance, and exhibit distinct interaction patterns between the neurons.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Firing times of neurons were obtained in experiments on localization and short term memory for space. In these experiments monkeys were trained to localize a source of light blink and then, after a delay, to touch the target from which the light blink was presented. <p> METHODS OF ANALYSIS The vector of parallel recorded spike trains was regarded as the output of an HMM.

This algorithm also provided the most likely segmentation of the data into states <ref> [10] </ref>. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this section we describe the results of several different methods of analysis carried out in this work: * Segmentation of the cortical activity. This was performed both in the local, fine-resolution, supervised method, and the global, coarse time resolution, unsupervised method.

Reference-contexts: Typically 70 repetitions of the same stimulus were submitted to analysis. In this analysis we utilized a fine time resolution of one ms. The activity of each neuron (firing or quiescent) at each ms was considered as the output of the process. The Baum-Welch algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> was used to estimate the state transition probabilities and the expected spike rates of each neuron in each state. The modulations of firing rates of each neuron, following each of the four stimuli, were evaluated by means of Post-Stimulus-Time Histogram (PSTH) with variable bin sizes.

Reference-contexts: The modulations of firing rates of each neuron, following each of the four stimuli, were evaluated by means of Post-Stimulus-Time Histogram (PSTH) with variable bin sizes. The 6 PSTH is an estimator of the time-variable firing rate of a neuron <ref> [15] </ref>. The bin size of the PSTH was not fixed, as is customary, but varied so as to contain 100 spikes per bin. This yields a constant accuracy of estimation of the rates, at the price of losing time resolution when the firing rates are low.

Reference-contexts: The assumption that the network has different sets of organized activity was tested by studying the cross-correlations between pairs of neurons in the different states <ref> [16] </ref>. The data was subjected to the coarse time resolution HMM analysis. Intervals in which the activity stayed in the same state for more than 1 sec were pulled together and the cross-correlations between 14 all the pairs of neurons were computed.
