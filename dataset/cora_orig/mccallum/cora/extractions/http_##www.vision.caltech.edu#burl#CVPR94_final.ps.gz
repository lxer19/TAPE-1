Abstract: Our long-term goal is to develop a trainable tool for locating patterns of interest in large image databases. Toward this goal we have developed a prototype system, based on classical filtering and statistical pattern recognition techniques, for automatically locating volcanoes in the Magellan SAR database of Venus. Training for the specific volcano-detection task is obtained by synthesizing feature templates (via normalization and principal components analysis) from a small number of examples provided by experts. Candidate regions identified by a focus of attention (FOA) algorithm are classified based on correlations with the feature templates. Preliminary tests show performance comparable to trained human observers.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, preliminary global surveys of the Magellan data show there are approximately 1400 volcanic features larger than 20km in diameter [3], and scientists estimate the number of small volcanoes (diameter &lt; 15km) on the planet to be ~ 10 6 <ref> [1] </ref>. Generating a comprehensive catalog including the size, location, and other relevant information about each volcano is clearly a prerequisite for more advanced studies such as cluster analysis of the volcano locations.

Reference-contexts: Previous observations from Soviet Venera 15/16, U.S. Pioneer Venus, and ground-based radar have revealed that volcanism is a dominant geologic process on Venus.

Reference-contexts: This strategy is equivalent to projecting the n-dimensional pixel space onto a q-dimensional subspace (feature space). Projecting onto a subspace is a classical problem in pattern recognition, from which two basic paradigms have emerged <ref> [4] </ref>: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal components analysis (PCA). LDA attempts to maximize the separation of classes in the projected space, while PCA attempts to best represent the original data. For the volcano problem, the class v, consisting of all ROIs that are not volcanoes, is extremely broad. <p> using counter-examples for training. (The FOA filter and PCA features were determined solely based on volcanoes.) The classifier could also be designed this way, but Fukunaga shows that such an algorithm is subject to considerable error even in relatively low dimensions because the location of the other distribution is unknown <ref> [4] </ref>. To overcome this problem, nents, (c) singular value decay we have experimented with various supervised two-class methods including quadratic classifiers, decision trees, and kernel density estimation. Good results were obtained with all these methods, but we currently favor the quadratic classifier due to its simplicity.

Reference-contexts: Category 4: p 0:5. Only a pit is visible; could be a volcano, but more evidence is needed. Some typical volcanoes from each category are shown in The confidence labels may be incorporated into training as described in [8] (see also <ref> [5, 7] </ref>). However, we have not found a significant improvement in performance by doing so.

Reference-contexts: The mapping was performed using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) because of its ability to penetrate the dense cloud cover surrounding Venus. A complete description of the Magellan SAR imaging system is given in <ref> [6] </ref>, so here only the most important characteristics are summarized: * Wavelength: 12.6cm * Frequency: 2.385 GHz - S band * Incidence Angle: 15 ffi - 45 ffi (nominal) * Range resolution: 120m - 360m * Azimuth resolution: 120m * Pixel-spacing: 75m (full resolution) * Number of looks: 5 - 16

Reference-contexts: Applying the matched filter to an image involves computing the normalized cross-correlation of f with each k fik image patch. The cross-correlation can be computed efficiently using separable kernel methods to approximate the 2-D kernel f as a sum of 1-D outer products <ref> [9] </ref>. High response values indicate that there is strong correlation between the filter and the image patch. Candidate volcano locations are placed where the matched filter response exceeds a threshold that is determined from training images.

Reference-contexts: The method of principal components has been used extensively in statistics, signal processing (Karhunen-Loeve transform), and pattern recognition (Turk and Pent-land <ref> [10] </ref>). The basic problem formulation is to find a q-dimensional subspace such that the projected data is closest in L 2 norm to the original data. The subspace we seek is spanned by the highest-eigenvalue eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: At maximum aggressiveness, every candidate from the FOA is declared to be a volcano; hence, the classifier performance curve is constrained to start from the FOA operating point. Observe that the combination of FOA and classification yields better performance than using only a matched filter (as proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>). As a basis for comparison, we evaluated the individual labeling performance of three planetary scientists who are all familiar with the Magellan data and with the appearance of volcanoes in the data (see Section 3.2). Each scientist's performance is plotted as an asterisk in Figure 7.
