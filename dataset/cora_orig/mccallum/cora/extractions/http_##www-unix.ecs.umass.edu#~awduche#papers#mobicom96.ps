Abstract: Future distributed systems are expected to support mobile computing through wireless extensions. In such environments, the spatial location of system resources, such as servers, can change dynamically as a result of host mobility. Consequently, a search or discovery cost is incurred whenever a client requests use of a mobile resource whose location is unknown. In addition, because of the acute dependence of radio link performance on the characteristics of indoor operating environments, the Quality of Service experienced by a client that utilizes a mobile resource can depend on the resource's specific location. The work reported in this paper proposes and evaluates a statistical framework for resource discovery in distributed computing environments with mobile hosts. Specifically, taking the peculiar attributes of wireless segments of the distributed system into account, we investigate the interplay between the cost of search for potentially mobile resources and the utility or benefit accrued to clients that require such resources. This interplay has important ramifications for resource allocation in distributed mobile computing environments.

Reference-contexts: Of particular importance are issues pertaining to resource management. In conventional wired systems, the location of most resources are fixed over prolonged time intervals. As a result, much of the work on resource management have been premised on the implicit assumption of stationary resources (see e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>). In a distributed computing environment with wireless extensions, the system's topological configuration changes dynamically as a result of host mobility; thereby mandating enhancements to classical abstractions for resource management [8, 7, 12, 15].

Reference-contexts: Finally, Section 5 contains our concluding remarks. 2 System Model We consider a distributed system, with a wired backbone network, that supports ubiquitous computing through a wireless local area network (WLAN) extension. Here, we suppose the WLAN is structured according to the proposed IEEE 802.11 draft specifications <ref> [14] </ref>; that is, the WLAN consists of a set of Basic Service Areas (BSAs) interconnected by a distribution system. An Access Point (AP) provides timing and control functions for each BSA, and serves as an interface between the BSA and the distribution system.
