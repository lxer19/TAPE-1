Title: Scalable Parallel Numerical Methods and Software Tools for Material Design  
Author: Eric J. Bylaska Scott R. Kohn Scott B. Baden Alan Edelman Ryoichi Kawai M. Elizabeth G. Ong k John H. Weare flfl 
Abstract: A new method of solution to the local spin density approximation to the electronic Schrodinger equation is presented. The method is based on an efficient, parallel, adaptive multigrid eigenvalue solver. It is shown that adaptivity is both necessary and sufficient to accurately solve the eigenvalue problem near the singularities at the atomic centers. While preliminary, these results suggest that direct real space methods may provide a much needed method for efficiently computing the forces in complex materials.

Reference-contexts: In this problem, there is only one electron. However, there are two centers with singularities. The Hamiltonian is: H = 2m 1 ~ R a j~r 2 j ; where ~ R a is the atomic separation.(4) This problem can also be solved analytically <ref> [1] </ref>. Again, it is two stiff for practical solution by FFT.

Reference-contexts: We note that the AMG solution and the exact solution (not plotted) are identical on the scale of the graph. The cusp at the origin is a result of the singular nature of the potential at this point. This behavior is usually difficult to resolve with a numerical method <ref> [5] </ref>. As the singularity strengthens with increasing charge, the lowest energy scales as Z 2 . to obtain the correct scaling, it is necessary to go to higher levels of adaptivity. However, because of increased localization, the total number of points remains roughly the same.

Reference-contexts: We locally refine the grid hierarchy according to an error estimate calculated at run-time. In general, the location and extent of refinement areas must be computed by the application, as they cannot be predicted a priori . We implemented our solver using the LPARX <ref> [6] </ref> parallel programming system, which provides efficient run-time support for scientific calculations with dynamic, block structured data. The use of LPARX was essential in facilitating code development; managing the complicated data structures of a composite grid hierarchy would have been a daunting task without LPARX, especially on parallel architectures.

Reference-contexts: For systems of typical size, the most reliable and efficient first principles approach is based on the local density approximation (LDA) of Kohn and Sham <ref> [8] </ref> to the full many-electron Schrodinger equation. However, current methods of solution scale as O (N 3 ), where N is the number of atoms. For systems of the size commonly encountered in materials science, such calculations are too large to be practical.

Reference-contexts: Such calculations are extremely CPU intensive. The eigenvalue equation for a real system is complicated by details which obscure the essential difficulties of its solution <ref> [9] </ref>. To develop test problems (see Section 4) which retain the essential singular behavior while removing nonessential details, we replace V H , V ext , and Scalable Numerical Methods for Material Design 3 V ex by simple potentials located at the atomic sites.
