Abstract: We investigate high bandwidth delay-sensitive multicast routing as an optimization problem. A solution would be especially useful for multi-user multimedia applications that have high performance requirements. Typically, such an application consists of a source that sends a large amount of data to a subset of nodes of the network. We desire that the least amount of bandwidth be used, while ensuring that the end-to-end delay from the source to any destination node be bounded by a specified delay tolerance. The problem is NP-complete. We present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm using a tree forwarding technique. Empirical results on random graphs show the solution to be near optimal. Keywords: multicast, tree forwarding, Steiner tree, multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: has been recognized to be a useful communication paradigm for several reasons: * Inter-process communication among a group of cooperating processes. * Data transfer to all parties involved in a conference. * Locating any one resource belonging to a class of resources all addressable by a common group network address <ref> [2] </ref>. Multicasting has been used in several networks and distributed systems, such as the V kernel [6], the Andrew file system [19], group activities, e.g., conferencing, shared editing, etc. [9,18].

Reference-contexts: All these applications transmit high-bandwidth data and expect the delay to be low enough to enable the user to experience aural and visual continuity. To appreciate the magnitude of the problem of continuous media communication <ref> [3] </ref>, consider the following figures. For continuous 2 motion video, the screen is refreshed 30 times per second. A 640x480 screen requires 7 megabytes of frame buffer memory. Thus, uncompressed motion video requires data rates of 220 megabits/sec.

Reference-contexts: We are also examining modifications to the algorithm to provide low-cost tree updates when multicast groups change. Some work has been done in this area <ref> [4] </ref>. We are also working on a distributed version of the algorithm that will reduce the effort needed to construct the least cost paths, and also take into account status changes in the network. 7 Appendix A Statement: The multicast tree problem is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: Thus, even with high-speed networks like B-ISDN or FDDI, bandwidth is still a scarce resource in the context of multimedia applications. Delay tolerance, on the other hand, is a very subjective measure. Delay tolerance limits range from about 40 to 600 milliseconds <ref> [5] </ref>. The propagation delay alone can play an important role in determining the quality of communication. For example, propagation delay across the United States is about 20 milliseconds. Satellites delays are even larger and magnify the problem of global communication.

Reference-contexts: A 640x480 screen requires 7 megabytes of frame buffer memory. Thus, uncompressed motion video requires data rates of 220 megabits/sec. Telephone quality sound with a spectrum of 4 KHz requires data rates of about 64 kilobits/sec (although 16 kilobits/sec has been reported to be sufficient <ref> [7] </ref>), while CD quality sound requires about 1.4 megabits/sec. With compression techniques, the bandwidth requirements for both audio and video traffic reduce by about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: The weight of the tree could correspond to the bandwidth that the multicast uses. * Constructing a multicast tree with shortest paths from the source to each destination <ref> [8] </ref>. 1 In tree forwarding multicasting, the data from the source is forwarded along the edges of a tree that spans all the nodes in the multicast group. 3 This could correspond to minimizing the delay on the path from source to each destination. <p> The network is a point-to-point network, with each node representing the main gateway of an institution to the outside world. Within a node, there may be a number of local area networks. Multicasting to these will be a local problem, following Deering's concept of hierarchical multicasting <ref> [8] </ref>. The links out of a node represent the physical connections that it has to other 4 nodes. We will look at how to multicast between the nodes of the point-to-point network.

Reference-contexts: For example, the flow could be the minimum bandwidth needed to maintain reasonable quality communication. There is an inclination to believe such parameters may be necessary to ensure that the network knows what minimum quality of service it must provide the application <ref> [10] </ref>. The delay tolerance D defines the sensitivity of the application to delay. The application has perfect behavior if the data reaches the destination within the delay constraint, and fails if the data reaches too late.

Reference-contexts: A good discussion of multicasting techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. We believe that a multicast routing algorithm that optimizes on bandwidth utilization will be essential for multimedia networking. However, in addition to minimizing the utilized bandwidth, the routing algorithm must also determine routes that bound the delay from source to destination.

Reference-contexts: These figures show that unless low delay routes are found, interactive multimedia communication may not be possible. Earlier work done on multicasting has emphasized network management details, e.g., modifications to existing network protocols to support multicasting [1,8,20], operating systems support for multicasting [15], and protocols for reliable multicasting <ref> [12] </ref>. Some work has been done in constructing optimal or near optimal trees for multicasting using tree forwarding techniques 1 . These include: * Constructing a near optimal Steiner tree, i.e., a tree that spans a given subset of nodes in the network, and has minimum total cost [21].

Reference-contexts: The application has perfect behavior if the data reaches the destination within the delay constraint, and fails if the data reaches too late. This is a reasonable condition because human perception of delay is not significant when the delay is low. For example, experiments <ref> [14] </ref> have shown that as long as the delay is small, clipping (when words are cut off because the data does not reach in time to fill the audio chip's buffer) is not perceptible. However, for larger delays, clipping is sufficiently noticeable as to be distracting.

Reference-contexts: The routing algorithm makes use of a very useful graph theoretic solution known as the Kou-Markowsky-Berman (KMB) algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>. The KMB algorithm generates an approximate Steiner tree, i.e., a tree that spans a subset S of nodes in the graph, and has minimum cost. The Steiner tree problem has been shown to be NP-complete, even if the edge weights are all equal to 1 [13,16].
