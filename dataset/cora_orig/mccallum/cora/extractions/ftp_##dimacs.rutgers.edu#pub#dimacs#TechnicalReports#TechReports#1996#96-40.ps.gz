Reference-contexts: Therefore, steps 2-4 of the algorithm can be implemented in NC 2 , and the overall complexity of the resulting algorithm is RNC 2 . 2.3 Derandomizing the construction The above construction can be derandomized by using the following small bias sample space of <ref> [AGHP92] </ref> instead of a random sample of n-bit vectors. Consider the Galois field GF (2 h ) of size 2 h .

Reference-contexts: This relation is interesting, because it provides fine classifications of P=poly: According to the power of the access, the reducibility closures of the sparse sets form proper hierarchies within P=poly (for such results, see <ref> [BK88, Ko89, AHOW92] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The result has set a lower bound on the strength of the collapse one could obtain assuming the existence of sparse hard sets. On the other hand, for the p m -case, Berman <ref> [Ber78] </ref> showed in 1978 that tally NP-hard sets would collapse NP to P, where tally sets are languages over one letter alphabets. A year later, Fortune [For79] improved this and showed that sparse coNP-hard sets would collapse NP to P.

Reference-contexts: Also, this huge list of NP-complete problems gives rise to the question what intrinsic properties NP-complete sets possess: Are there any structural properties other than being complete, that NP-complete sets have in common? In 1976, Berman and Hartmanis suggested such a property <ref> [BH77] </ref>. The two researchers examined all NP-complete sets known at the time and showed that they are p-isomorphic, i.e., isomorphic with respect to polynomial time computable, polynomial time invertible bijections.

Reference-contexts: First, matrix-vector multiplication over GF (2) is in NC 1 and solving full-rank systems of linear equations over GF (2) can be done in NC 2 <ref> [BvzGH82] </ref>. So, for any fixed fl 2 2 f0; 1g t , we can compute fl 1 in NC 2 . Second, the consistency test for a fixed assignment to fl 2 can be done by a uniform O (log n) depth circuit.

Reference-contexts: We will discuss the proof in more detail in the next section. The proof technique by Cai and Sivakumar not only resolved the long standing open question for P, but also paved the way to settle the other conjecture by Hartmanis. First, Cai, Naik, and Sivakumar <ref> [CNS96] </ref> proved that sparse log m -hard sets for NL collapse NL to randomized logspace. The collapse is then improved by Cai and Sivakumar [CS95b] to L. Now that the conjectures are resolved, the Ogihara-Watanabe result motivates researchers to study whether the resolutions can be strengthened to bounded truth-table reductions. <p> The collapse is then improved by Cai and Sivakumar [CS95b] to L. Now that the conjectures are resolved, the Ogihara-Watanabe result motivates researchers to study whether the resolutions can be strengthened to bounded truth-table reductions. In this regard, Cai, Naik, and Sivakumar <ref> [CNS96] </ref> showed that P = NC 2 holds if sparse log hard sets exist for P. The collapse has been improved by Van Melkebeek [vM96] to P = L, so, the bounded truth-table case is completely solved.

Reference-contexts: These two breakthrough results started a "gold rush" in the study of sparse hard sets for classes above P and many interesting theorems were proven (for a survey, see <ref> [HOW92, You92, CO96] </ref>). 1.3 The Sparseness Conjecture for P and NL The question whether there are sparse hard sets applies to other classes than NP as well, with appropriate choices of reducibilities.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 The Birth of the Area The most important discovery in computational complexity theory is no doubt NP-completeness. Since Cook <ref> [Coo71] </ref> and Levin [Lev73] independently established the notion, thousands of natural NP-complete problems have been identified in various scientific fields (for a list of NP-complete problems, see e.g., [GJ79]). NP-complete problems are a "core" of NP in the sense that any of them belonging to NP implies P=NP.

Reference-contexts: The one and only related observation in this regard is a result by Hemaspaandra, Ogihara, and Toda [HOT94] that polylog dense log m -hard sets would collapse P (and NL) to Steve's class SC (= TimeSpace [poly; polylog]) <ref> [Coo85] </ref>. The study has been stymied by the fact that the proof techniques for classes above P cannot be applied due to the lack of memory in logarithmic space.

Reference-contexts: the whole process is O (log 2 n), and thus, P having sparse log m -hard sets implies P Space [log 2 n]. - 4 - Building upon this construction, Cai and Sivakumar obtained a resolution: P has sparse log m -hard sets if and only if P = L <ref> [CS95a] </ref>. The proof, which consists of three steps, is highly algebraic and full of clever ideas. The first step introduces randomness in Ogihara's reduction procedure. The randomization provides the collapse P RNC 2 , which is incomparable with P Space [log 2 n].

Reference-contexts: This simple, plausible statement has attracted many brilliant scientists over the past two decades and has become a central research area in complexity theory. (The reader may refer to <ref> [KMR90, You90, FFK92] </ref> for the current status of the isomorphism conjecture.) What does this conjecture suggest? First of all, P 6= NP, because finite sets are in P NP but not isomorphic to SAT. Second, more amusingly, sparse sets are not NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, for the p m -case, Berman [Ber78] showed in 1978 that tally NP-hard sets would collapse NP to P, where tally sets are languages over one letter alphabets. A year later, Fortune <ref> [For79] </ref> improved this and showed that sparse coNP-hard sets would collapse NP to P. Both Berman and Fortune develop a polynomial time decision procedure for SAT under the assumption that SAT c is p m -reducible to some low density set.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 The Birth of the Area The most important discovery in computational complexity theory is no doubt NP-completeness. Since Cook [Coo71] and Levin [Lev73] independently established the notion, thousands of natural NP-complete problems have been identified in various scientific fields (for a list of NP-complete problems, see e.g., <ref> [GJ79] </ref>). NP-complete problems are a "core" of NP in the sense that any of them belonging to NP implies P=NP. Together with the fact that none of them are known to be in P, these numerous NP-complete problems seem to amount to evidence that P 6= NP.

Reference-contexts: In 1978, Hartmanis studied the existence of sparse log m -hard sets for various complexity classes and showed that PSPACE, EXPTIME = S c&gt;0 Time (2 n c ), and EXPSPACE = S c&gt;0 Space (2 n c ) all lack such sparse complete sets <ref> [Har78] </ref>. Then he insightfully conjectured that there are no sparse complete sets for P or NL under log m -reductions. Conjecture 2 The Sparseness Conjecture for P and NL No sparse set is complete for P or NL.

Reference-contexts: However, until very recently, there has been little progress on the sparseness conjecture for P and NL. The one and only related observation in this regard is a result by Hemaspaandra, Ogihara, and Toda <ref> [HOT94] </ref> that polylog dense log m -hard sets would collapse P (and NL) to Steve's class SC (= TimeSpace [poly; polylog]) [Coo85].

Reference-contexts: Berman and Hartmanis, in their conjecture paper, observed that the - 2 - T reducibility closure of the sparse sets is identical to "nonuniform P" (the class of sets recognized by polynomial size circuits), denoted by P=poly <ref> [KL80] </ref>. The property of a class C being reducible to sparse sets then can be viewed as that of possessing small nonuniform complexity. <p> In 1980, Karp and Lipton <ref> [KL80] </ref> showed that NP, PSPACE, EXPTIME = S , and, in general, classes C with self-reducible complete sets, lack sparse p T -hard sets unless PH = p 2 , PSPACE = p 2 , EXPTIME = p NP C = coNP C , respectively.

Reference-contexts: This relation is interesting, because it provides fine classifications of P=poly: According to the power of the access, the reducibility closures of the sparse sets form proper hierarchies within P=poly (for such results, see <ref> [BK88, Ko89, AHOW92] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, logspace machines cannot do this. In [Ogi95], for the first time in two decades, Ogihara demonstrated that one could overcome this difficulty. The key idea is the use of a language called Parity-CVP, a variation of the circuit-value problem CVP, a typical P-complete problem <ref> [Lad75] </ref>. While CVP tests whether a given circuit C outputs 1 on a given input x, this auxiliary language tests, given an additional list of gates of C and an additional bit b, whether the output of the gates in the list adds up to b modulo 2. <p> Section 4 discusses some future research topics. 2 Sparse Many-one Hard Sets for P: From Ogihara to Cai-Sivakumar A standard P-complete problem is the circuit value problem CVP <ref> [Lad75] </ref>, which asks whether a given circuit outputs 1 on a given input. In his breakthrough paper, Ogihara introduced a variation of CVP, called Parity-CVP.

Reference-contexts: We require h to be of the form 2 3 l , because an easy explicit expression for an irreducible polynomial of degree 2 3 l over GF (2) is known (namely, X 23 l + X 3 l + 1) <ref> [vL91] </ref>, which allows us to perform all arithmetic involved efficiently.

Reference-contexts: The final piece of the puzzle was placed by Mahaney in 1980 <ref> [Mah82] </ref>, who showed that sparse p m -hard sets for NP exist if and only if P = NP. The key idea in Mahaney's proof is the introduction of the "pseudo-complement" of sparse complete sets.

Reference-contexts: In this regard, Cai, Naik, and Sivakumar [CNS96] showed that P = NC 2 holds if sparse log hard sets exist for P. The collapse has been improved by Van Melkebeek <ref> [vM96] </ref> to P = L, so, the bounded truth-table case is completely solved. The technique by Van Melkebeek can be applied to all complexity classes with simple unique membership proofs. He showed that sparse log btt -hard sets for NL collapses NL to L.

Reference-contexts: Construct matrix A 1 from A by eliminating the i-th column if and only if A i and A i1 have the same rank. Put the remaining columns in A 2 . Mulmuley <ref> [Mul87] </ref> constructed an NC 2 algorithm to compute the rank of a matrix. All calls to the reduction f are made in parallel in step 2, and can be executed in NC 2 , since f is logspace computable.

Reference-contexts: The procedure needs to maintain a polynomial number of nodes in the self-reduction tree of SAT. Clearly, logspace machines cannot do this.
