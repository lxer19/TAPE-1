Abstract: The Functionally-Accurate, Cooperative (FA/C) paradigm provides a model for task decomposition and agent interaction in a distributed problemsolving system. In this model, agents need not have all the necessary information locally to solve their subproblems, and agents interact through the asynchronous, co-routine exchange of partial results. This model leads to the possibility that agents may behave in an uncoordinated manner. This paper traces the development of a series of increasingly sophisticated cooperative control mechanisms for coordinating agents. They include integrating data and goal-directed control, using static metalevel information specified by an organizational structure, and using dynamic metalevel information developed in partial global planning. The framework of distributed search motivates these developments. Major themes of this work are the importance of sophisticated local control, the interplay between local control and cooperative control, and the use of satisficing cooperative control. Ongoing and new directions for research in FA/C systems are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Functionally-Accurate/Cooperative (FA/C) model for distributed problem solving was presented in a paper that appeared in the 1981 special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics on Distributed AI <ref> [1] </ref>. The purpose of this retrospective is two-fold: first, to elaborate more fully this model based on insights acquired over the last ten years, and second, to provide a coherent perspective on its development and extension since its original description [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Early Experimental Results The major experimental validations of the FA/C model have all involved applications in the area of distributed interpretation <ref> [2, 19] </ref>. These applications have used a blackboard 1 0 architecture for local problem solving because of the flexibility and modularity of its control regime and the incremental, opportunistic and asynchronous nature of its processing.

Its interface to local control is through the establishment of high level policies that the local control implements <ref> [3, 7] </ref>. In this case, the local control is clearly distinguishable from the cooperative control, has a certain amount of latitude in its decisions based on local information and may have no direct knowledge of the state of other agents problem solving. <p> An alternative approach based on a satisficing approach to cooperative control, which does not require constant reevaluation of all cooperative control decisions and is thus less computationally expensive, is to realize cooperative control decisions through a two-level decision process <ref> [3, 30] </ref>. One level, called the organizational design level, refers to strategic decisions that do not need to be constantly reevaluated in order to get reasonable overall performance. The other level, called the agent level, refers to tactical decisions that are constantly reevaluated. <p> We ran a number of experiments using different organizational structures to see whether these structures led to more coherent behavior. One set of experiments compared a hierarchical problemsolving organization with a lateral organization. The experimental results did not indicate clearly which organization was preferable <ref> [3, 4, 30] </ref>. Before experimentation it was thought that the hierarchical problemsolving organization would perform better. One explanation for the lack of clear-cut experimental results was that the agents problem solving was not sufficiently sophisticated to take advantage of the more comprehensive information produced by a hierarchical organization.

In summary, using static metalevel information to guide and constrain agent level control decisions only partially achieved coherent behavior among agents in the DVMT. In some situations, the agents lacked the appropriate sophistication necessary to fully exploit a more informed view. <p> These questions are beginning to be addressed [25, 26]. Another related issue concerns whether the computational and communication costs of sophisticated cooperative control are always justified. Situations can arise that, based on the characteristics of the data, indicate this cost is not always warranted <ref> [4] </ref>. One such situation occurs when the goal structures of local agents are not strongly connectedthere is neither a significant amount of goal redundancy nor strong constraint interactions among goals in different agents.

Instead, such systems use a hierarchical metalevel organization in which top-level agents compute partial 3 5 global plans for lower level agents.

Reference-contexts: Once again, communication with agent B helps to confirm most of this data (times 5 through 7 in the overlapping region) as ghost data and can provide a source (T 1 ) for the G 1 ghost track (see <ref> [17] </ref> for more details). 7 Implications for Local Problem Solving The computation and reasoning needed in this example indicates some of the requirements that the FA/C paradigm imposes on local problem solving: operate in what could be called an asynchronous mode in which it cannot be assumed that all the information <p> In the last case, the belief in the correctness of the partial result rating should be lowered. 6 The ease with which these decisions are made is directly related to the explicitness of the evidential representation scheme in the agent <ref> [17] </ref>. In this way, the amount of redundant computation among agents could be decreased. In summary, this first stage in the evolution of strategies for cooperative control showed that more coherence in agent activities could be achieved if agents dynamically constructed a partial representation of their problemsolving goal structure. <p> Agents may also want to engage in multi-step communication protocols and, depending upon the results, temporarily abandon the solution of certain goals. We have seen these more complex protocols arise when agents have more sophisticated evidential reasoning capabilities <ref> [17] </ref>. How does this increase in opportunism in local problem solving affect the suitability of partial global planning? Further, there may be more complex relationships among goals such as the favor relation [23]. <p> This includes understanding what parts of the goal structure have been explored, where solution uncertainty is present in these goals and what its character is, and whether all the systemwide constraints have been developed that could significantly affect confidence in a solution <ref> [17] </ref>. The agents in the network use this information to control further cooperative problem solving in order to reach an acceptable solution. How can this information be abstracted so that it can be transferred among agents? Continuous problemsolving systems also present issues. <p> This architecture also provides the necessary inferencing capabilities that were lacking in the DVMT to exploit the more comprehensive view provided in a hierarchical organization. The DRESUN architecture <ref> [17] </ref> is an extension of RESUN for distributed problem solving. The key to achieving the necessary complex and dynamic interactions among RESUN agents is to make the solution convergence process explicit.

Reference-contexts: Satisficing Problem Solving An important aspect of the FA/C model that was alluded to but never developed in the original paper is the concept of satisficing problem solving. This concept was developed by March and Simon <ref> [18] </ref> to explain how complex organizations function when there is significant environmental uncertainty. For many applications, even though there exist strict criteria for acceptable answers, answers meeting less stringent criteria are often still useful.

Early Experimental Results The major experimental validations of the FA/C model have all involved applications in the area of distributed interpretation <ref> [2, 19] </ref>. These applications have used a blackboard 1 0 architecture for local problem solving because of the flexibility and modularity of its control regime and the incremental, opportunistic and asynchronous nature of its processing. This application area has provided a rich source of intuitions about the FA/C paradigm. <p> The objective of this application was to identify, locate, and track patterns of vehicles moving through a two-dimensional space using signals detected by distributed acoustic sensors. A system, called the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) <ref> [19] </ref>, was developed. It simulated a network of problemsolving agents performing this distributed interpretation application. Each agent was a blackboard problemsolving system with knowledge sources and levels of abstraction appropriate for this application. <p> The partial global planning task negotiation algorithm <ref> [19] </ref> uses a simplified form of this replanning activity. Another example of more complex relationships occurs when there are real-time constraints among goals.

Reference-contexts: This construction can involve a top-down elaboration process based on the higher level goals, a bottom-up process driven by the data, or a process combining both the top-down and bottom-up creation of goals (see <ref> [24] </ref> for a model of how goal structures are dynamically created in a distributed problemsolving system). Additionally, the criteria for problemsolving success may not be just the generation of a solution but one that is optimal along some dimension (such as cost or credibility).

Reference-contexts: Instead, we developed a new testbed based on a vehicle monitoring application similar to the application described in section 2. This interpretation application was based loosely on the distributed sensor network task that Smith used in his work on contract-nets <ref> [27] </ref>. The objective of this application was to identify, locate, and track patterns of vehicles moving through a two-dimensional space using signals detected by distributed acoustic sensors. A system, called the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) [19], was developed. <p> A third example, which is reminiscent of the focused addressing mode in the contract net protocol <ref> [27] </ref>, is where the organization design level policy indicates that there are three possible agents that can satisfy a goal of a particular type. The local agent negotiates with just these three agents instead of all agents to see which one is currently most appropriate for generating the requested result.

Reference-contexts: In order to eliminate the derivation of any intermediate result that could eventually produce an existing high-level result, a separate mechanism, called inhibiting goals, was later developed <ref> [29] </ref>. This new mechanism had to be integrated with KS execution, KSs that satisfied multiple goals, including an inhibiting goal, could still be executed but were not allowed to generate results that were subsumed by the inhibiting goal specification.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach based on a satisficing approach to cooperative control, which does not require constant reevaluation of all cooperative control decisions and is thus less computationally expensive, is to realize cooperative control decisions through a two-level decision process <ref> [3, 30] </ref>. One level, called the organizational design level, refers to strategic decisions that do not need to be constantly reevaluated in order to get reasonable overall performance. The other level, called the agent level, refers to tactical decisions that are constantly reevaluated. <p> We ran a number of experiments using different organizational structures to see whether these structures led to more coherent behavior. One set of experiments compared a hierarchical problemsolving organization with a lateral organization. The experimental results did not indicate clearly which organization was preferable <ref> [3, 4, 30] </ref>. Before experimentation it was thought that the hierarchical problemsolving organization would perform better. One explanation for the lack of clear-cut experimental results was that the agents problem solving was not sufficiently sophisticated to take advantage of the more comprehensive information produced by a hierarchical organization.

Reference-contexts: The less predictability, the more communication and processing is required by cooperative control to achieve coherent behavior <ref> [32] </ref>. The agents exchange this partial and augmented view of the expected local goal structure. By combining interacting fragments of different agents goal structures, an agent constructs partial global goals and plans. An agent uses this information to understand how its activities relate to those of other agents. <p> The partial global plans need not be updated when the estimated time for completion of goals changes slightly. This strategy trades off nonoptimal coordination caused by out-of-date information or built-in overestimations of goal completion times against reductions in both frequency of communicating goal structures and recomputing partial global plans <ref> [32] </ref>. Creating partial global plans is also not synchronized among agents. For limited times, agents can work on partial global plans that are inconsistent since some agents views of other agents is out-of-date.

Reference-contexts: This information is also used to implement a sophisticated form of contract-net type task allocation in which agents that are overloaded can transfer tasks to underutilized agents <ref> [33] </ref>, to make communication decisions about when partial results should be transmitted, and to decide where to aggregate partial results into solutions of more encompassing goals. We also incorporate static organizational knowledge. <p> An agents current near-term view can indicate it is underutilized and therefore a candidate for tasks to be transferred to it. However, the agent making the transfer decision may be able to predict that the apparently underutilized agent will soon have a significant processing load <ref> [33] </ref>. 3 2 In summary, using partial global planning in the DVMT leads to much more coherent activity among agents. It provides an elegant and integrated solution to many of the problems that arise when a search is distributed among agents.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the use of satisficing control has an overall positive effect on systemwide performance. Implementing partial global planning in the DVMT required extensive changes to the agent architecture <ref> [34] </ref>. At the heart of these changes is a new data structure that represents the goals the agent is likely to pursue based on the available data. The agent computes the new data structure by using a simplified form of the knowledge used in normal knowledge-source processing.

Reference-contexts: Both areas are concerned with distributed resource allocation. The first, the Multi-Fireboss Phoenix application, requires cooperative planning among agents to arrive at an acceptable plan to fight the outstanding fires <ref> [35] </ref>. Agent interaction focuses on loaning bulldozers by one agent to another agent that has insufficient local resources to effectively fight the fires in its region. The second, and more developed application, involves restoring transmission paths for dedicated circuits in a long-haul communications network [36].

The communications network is controlled by a group of agents, each of which are responsible for allocating circuits to specific regions of the network. Multiple circuit restoral goals, located in different agents in the network, may be currently active.

Reference-contexts: Another example of more complex relationships occurs when there are real-time constraints among goals. Agents may have alternative methods for solving a goal that trade off the precision, completeness, or certainty of a solution against the time to generate a solution <ref> [37, 38] </ref>. Also, in this situation, agents may need to interact in ways not currently possible 3 6 in the partial global planning framework in order to appropriately reorganize their goal structure and dynamically change the criterion for acceptable answers.
