Abstract: In this paper we introduce Challenger, a multi-agent system that performs completely distributed resource allocation. Challenger consists of agents which individually manage local resources; these agents communicate with one another to share their resources (in this particular instance, CPU time) in an attempt to more efficiently utilize them. By endowing the agents with relatively simple behaviors which rely on only locally available information, desirable global system objectives can be obtained, such minimization of mean job flow time. Challenger is similar to other market-based control systems in that the agents act as buyers and sellers in a marketplace, always trying to maximize their own utility. The results of several simulations of Challenger performing CPU load balancing in a network of computers are presented. The main contribution of this research is the addition of learning to the agents, which allows Challenger to perform better under a wider range of conditions than other existing systems, such as Mal-one's Enterprise [Mal88].

Reference-contexts: One such technique is market-based control. In the words of one of its proponents, "market-based control is a paradigm for controlling complex systems that would otherwise be very difficult to control, maintain, or expand" <ref> [Cle96a] </ref>. As its name suggests, market-based control works by the same principles that real economic markets do: through the interaction of local agents, coherent global behavior is achieved. <p> The agents trade with one another using a relatively simple mechanism, yet desirable global objectives can often be achieved, such as stable prices or efficient resource allocation <ref> [Cle96a] </ref>. The fundamental appeal of the market as a model for managing complex systems is its ability to yield desirable global behavior on the basis of agents acting on only local information.
