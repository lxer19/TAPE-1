Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The crossing number of a graph G is usually defined as "the minimum number of edge crossings in any drawing of G in the plane" <ref> [BL84] </ref>. However, one has to be careful with this definition, because it can be interpreted in several ways. Sometimes it is assumed that in a proper drawing no two edges cross more than once, and if two edges share an endpoint, they cannot have another point in common ([WB78], [B91]).

Reference-contexts: However, one has to be careful with this definition, because it can be interpreted in several ways. Sometimes it is assumed that in a proper drawing no two edges cross more than once, and if two edges share an endpoint, they cannot have another point in common ([WB78], <ref> [B91] </ref>). Many authors do not make this assumption ([T70], [GJ83], [SSSV97]). If two edges are allowed to cross several times, we may count their intersections with multiplicity or without. <p> No matter what definition we use, the determination of the crossing number of a graph appears to be an extremely difficult task ([GJ83], <ref> [B91] </ref>). In fact, we do not even know the asymptotic value of any of the above quantities for the complete graph K n with n vertices and for the complete bipartite graph K n;n with 2n vertices, as n tends to infinity [RT97].

Reference-contexts: If two edges are allowed to cross several times, we may count their intersections with multiplicity or without. We may also wish to impose some further restrictions on the drawings (e.g., the edges must be straight-line segments [J71], or polygonal paths of length at most k <ref> [BD93] </ref>). No matter what definition we use, the determination of the crossing number of a graph appears to be an extremely difficult task ([GJ83], [B91]). <p> Clearly, we have odd-cr (G) pair-cr (G) cr (G) lin-cr (G); - 2 - It was shown by Bienstock and Dean <ref> [BD93] </ref> that there are graphs with crossing number 4, whose rectilinear crossing numbers are arbitrarily large. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that odd-cr (G) = pair-cr (G) = cr (G) for every graph G.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4. Given a graph G and an integer K, it is an NP-complete problem to decide whether (i) pair-cr (G) K, or (ii) odd-cr (G) K. 2 Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 First we establish Theorem 1. The proof somewhat resembles a proof of Kuratowski's theorem (see <ref> [BM76] </ref>). Suppose Theorem 1 is false. <p> The endpoints of these edges in C are called the endpoints of bridge B. (See also <ref> [BM76] </ref>.) P (x; y) will always denote a path in G between two vertices, x and y. Claim 2. G contains an E 0 -cycle which has at least two bridges. Proof.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that odd-cr (G) = pair-cr (G) = cr (G) for every graph G. The only result in this direction is the following remarkable theorem of Hanani and Tutte (see also [LPS97]). Theorem A. <ref> [Ch34] </ref>, [T70] If a graph G can be drawn in the plane so that any two edges which do not share an endpoint cross an even number of times, then G is planar.

Reference-contexts: It follows from Theorem A that if all edges of G are even, i.e., if odd-cr (G) = 0, then cr (G) = 0: (In this case, by Fary's theorem <ref> [F48] </ref>, we also have lin-cr (G) = 0:) In the next section, we establish the following generalization of this statement. Theorem 1. For a fixed drawing of a graph G, let G 0 G denote the subgraph formed by all even edges.

We may also wish to impose some further restrictions on the drawings (e.g., the edges must be straight-line segments [J71], or polygonal paths of length at most k [BD93]). <p> Theorem 3. Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E (G) such that jE (G)j 4jV (G)j. Then we have odd-cr (G) 64 jV (G)j 2 : - 3 - It was shown by Garey and Johnson <ref> [GJ83] </ref> that, given a graph G and an integer K, it is an NP-complete problem to decide whether cr (G) K. In the last section we show that the same is true for the other variants of the crossing number studied in this paper. Theorem 4. <p> This result is somewhat stronger than Theorem 3, because here we do not count any odd crossing between two edges that share an endpoint. 4 Proof of Theorem 4 Garey and Johnson <ref> [GJ83] </ref> proved that the Crossing Number Problem, cr (G) K, is NP-complete. By a slight modification of their argument, one can prove part (i) of Theorem 4. The details of this proof are left to the reader. The aim of this section is to establish part (ii) of Theorem 4.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we have X (j (u) (v)j 1)jEj 2 odd-cr (G 0 which implies that X uv2E as desired. 2 With Lemma 4.2, the proof of Theorem 4 (ii) is complete, because the Linear Ar rangement Problem is known to be NP-complete <ref> [GJS76] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, we prove Theorem 2. The crossing number of any graph G satisfies cr (G) 2 (odd-cr (G)) : It was discovered by Leighton <ref> [L84] </ref> that the crossing number can be used to obtain a lower bound on the chip area required for the VLSI circuit layout of a graph. For this purpose, he proved the following general lower bound for cr (G), which was discovered independently by Ajtai, Chvatal, Newborn, and Szemeredi. <p> For this purpose, he proved the following general lower bound for cr (G), which was discovered independently by Ajtai, Chvatal, Newborn, and Szemeredi.
