Abstract: Social comparison, the process in which individuals compare their behavior and beliefs to those of other agents, is an important process in human societies. Our aim is to utilize theories of this process for synthetic agents, for the purposes of enabling social skills, team-coordination, and greater individual agent performance. Our current focus is on individual failure detection and recovery in multi-agent settings. We present a novel approach, SOCFAD, inspired by Social Comparison Theory from social psychology. SOCFAD includes the following key novel concepts: (a) utilizing other agents in the environment as information sources for failure detection, and (b) a detection and recovery method for previously undetectable failures using abductive inference based on other agents beliefs 1 .

Reference-contexts: Our current focus is to utilize this process for an individual agents behavior monitoring. Agent behavio r monitoring is a well known and difficult problem, especially in dynamic environments <ref> (e.g., Doyle et al. 1986, Reece and Tate 1994) </ref>. The unpredictability of such dynamic environments causes an explosion of state space complexity, which inhibits the ability of any designer (human or machine) to enumerate in advance the correct responses for all possible states.

Reference-contexts: When the monitoring agent has access not only to its own original beliefs, goals, plans, etc., but also to those of its group members, the process of comparison can take place. Our agents design is based on reactive plans (operators) <ref> (Firby 1987, Newell 1990, Rao et al. 1993) </ref>, which form hierarchies that control each agent. The design implements the Joint Intention Framework (Levesque et al. 1990). Following this framework, operators may be team operators (shared by the team) or individual (specific to one agent).

Reference-contexts: Following this framework, operators may be team operators (shared by the team) or individual (specific to one agent). Team operators achieve and maintain joint goals, and require coordination with the other members of the team as part of their application <ref> (Tambe 1996, Tambe 1997) </ref>. Different capabilities and performance result by changing the information being compared (e.g., internal beliefs and goals vs. observable behavior). It is useful to use information that captures the control processes of the agents. Operator hierarchies are therefore natural objects for modeling and comparison.
