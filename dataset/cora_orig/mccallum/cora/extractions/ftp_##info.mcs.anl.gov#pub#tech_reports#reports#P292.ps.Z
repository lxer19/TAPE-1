Abstract: It is well known that orderings based on graph colorings can slow the convergence of many iterative methods. However, orderings based on graph colorings can be used to build scalable, parallel iterative methods. For example, SOR with consistent orderings, SSOR, and incomplete Cholesky can all be implemented in a scalable manner using graph colorings. It has been observed experimentally that if, for a fixed problem, the number of colors used is increased, then the SSOR PCG method will converge faster. In this paper we prove that for a model problem the multilevel SOR algorithm with consistent orderings will converge more quickly as the number of colors used is increased. We also give a formula for computing the optimal relaxation parameter and rate of convergence as a function of the number of colors. We prove a similar, but limited, result for ICCG. These results are useful because they allow the algorithm designer to trade off parallel efficiency for fewer iterations. For example, the nine-point Laplacian can be colored using a minimum of four colors. However, a matrix ordering based on four-colorings may result in poor convergence. If eight rather than four colors are used, the convergence rate will be increased without, perhaps, unduly affecting the parallel efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Further discussion of this algorithm is given in x3. We note that for the specific case of four-coloring the nine-point Laplacian, an alternative to the multilevel SOR algorithm is a nonconsistently ordered SOR algorithm for which the optimal relaxation parameter can be determined by solving a quartic equation <ref> [1] </ref>. The multilevel SOR algorithm has advantages over the traditional approach of obtaining a consistent ordering by breadth-first search (BFS) and then using red/black SOR. In the BFS approach, subproblems associated with narrow strips of grid points must be solved.

Reference-contexts: However, for most of these iterative methods, the convergence rate after reordering is slower than that of the "natural" ordering. For example, for the standard five-point difference operator the incomplete Cholesky preconditioner has a condition number of 2 p 2) 2 h 2 with the natural ordering <ref> [2] </ref> and a condition number of 1 2 h 2 with a red/black ordering [8]. Harrar [5] has observed experimentally for the SSOR PCG method that the convergence rate improves if more colors are used to color the graph of the matrix.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the right plot in Figure 1 we show the predicted times associated with these multicolorings when we use a variant of the parallel execution model given by Elman and Agron <ref> [3] </ref> for solving the same 128 fi 128 grid problem with 16 processors. For the model, we chose the parameters o = 10, c = 10, and s = 1; the same parameters suggested by Elman and Agron in x6 of their paper.

Reference-contexts: By using a multilevel 1 approach, a consistent ordering can be obtained for any number of colors. The optimal relaxation factor can be cheaply computed for any consistently ordered, symmetric positive definite matrix <ref> [4] </ref>. Consider the four-color example given in split into two groups to form a 2 fi 2 block matrix. This 2 fi 2 matrix is trivially consistently ordered, and an optimal relaxation parameter can be computed.

In Table 3 our approximations to the eigenvalues are compared to the calculated eigenvalues for several mesh sizes. We observe that the computed values converge to predicted values with increasing mesh size.

In this section we briefly discuss the multilevel SOR algorithm when used with the block colorings described in the second part of x2. Following Kuo and Levy <ref> [9] </ref>, we consider solving the inner subproblems iteratively; we may perform only a few iterations for each subproblem. We are now concerned with the convergence of the multilevel SOR algorithm when the inner subproblems are not solved to full accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Following Kuo and Levy [9], we consider solving the inner subproblems iteratively; we may perform only a few iterations for each subproblem. We are now concerned with the convergence of the multilevel SOR algorithm when the inner subproblems are not solved to full accuracy. From Lanzkron et al. <ref> [10] </ref> we know that the multilevel SOR algorithm can be characterized as an inner/outer iteration method. To guarantee convergence for a two-level inner/outer iteration method, the outer iteration must be a regular splitting and the inner iteration must be weak regular.
