Reference-contexts: The system has the following distinct features: 1. It incorporates several interesting data mining techniques, including attribute-oriented induction (Han, Cai, & Cercone 1993; Han & Fu 1996), statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining multiple-level rules (Han & Fu 1995; 1996), and meta-rule guided knowledge mining <ref> (Fu & Han 1995) </ref>. <p> Since the nested tuples (or values) can be viewed as data items in the same transaction, the methods for mining association rules in transaction databases, such as <ref> (Han & Fu 1995) </ref>, can be applied to such transformed relations in relational databases. Multi-dimensional data cube structure facilitates efficient mining of multi-level flat association rules. <p> In principle, a meta-rule can be used to guide the mining of many kinds of rules. Since the association rules are in the form similar to logic rules, we have first studied meta-rule guided mining of association rules in relational databases <ref> (Fu & Han 1995) </ref>. Different from the study by (Shen et al. 1996) where a meta-predicate may match any relation predicates, deductive predicates, attributes, etc., we confine the search to those predicates corresponding to the attributes in one relation. One such example is illustrated as follows. Example 3.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, they can be adjusted dynamically based on the distribution of the set of data relevant to the data mining task. Also, hierarchies for numerical attributes can be constructed automatically based on data distribution analysis <ref> (Han & Fu 1994) </ref>. DMQL and Interactive Data Mining DBMiner offers both an SQL-like data mining query language, DMQL, and a graphical user interface for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge. Example 1.

Reference-contexts: There have been many data classification methods studied, including decision-tree methods, such as ID-3 and C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), statistical methods, neural networks, rough sets, etc. Recently, some database-oriented classification methods have also been investigated <ref> (Mehta, Agrawal, & Rissanen 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such constraints can be specified in a meta-rule (or meta-pattern) form <ref> (Shen et al. 1996) </ref>, which confines the search to specific forms of rules. For example, a meta-rule "P (x; y) ! Q (x; y; z)", where P and Q are predicate variables matching different properties in a database, can be used as a rule-form constraint in the search. <p> Since the association rules are in the form similar to logic rules, we have first studied meta-rule guided mining of association rules in relational databases (Fu & Han 1995).
