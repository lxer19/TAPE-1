Abstract: It is well-known by now that large parts of (non-constructive) mathematical reasoning can be carried out in systems T which are conservative over primitive recursive arithmetic PRA (and even much weaker systems). On the other hand there are principles S of elementary analysis (like the Bolzano-Weierstra principle, the existence of a limit superior for bounded sequences etc.) which are known to be equivalent to arithmetical comprehension (relative to T ) and therefore go far beyond the strength of PRA (when added to T ). In this paper we determine precisely the arithmetical and computational strength (in terms of optimal conservation results and subrecursive characterizations of provably recursive functions) of weaker function parameter-free schematic versions S of S, thereby exhibiting different levels of strength between these principles as well as a sharp borderline between fragments of analysis which are still conservative over PRA and extensions which just go beyond the strength of PRA.

Reference-contexts: In section 5 below we will show that already PRA 2 +Limsup contains PRA+ 0 10 Definition 3.6 By T n we denote the fragment of Godel's calculus T of primitive recursive functionals in all finite types where one only has recursor constants R ae with deg (ae) n (see <ref> [19] </ref> for details).

Reference-contexts: We call the resulting system PRA 2 . On easily shows that PRA 2 is a definitorial extension of PRA 2 + (It). EA 2 is the restriction of PRA 2 to elementary recursive function (al)s only (see <ref> [20] </ref> for a definition of `elementary recursive functional'). 2 So we could have used also variables and quantifiers for n-ary functions instead and treat sequences of functions as f n := m:f (n; m).

Reference-contexts: theoretic functions). 2 We have the axioms and rules of many-sorted classical predicate logic as well as symbols and defining equations for all primitive recursive functionals of type level 2 in the sense of Kleene [7] (i.e. ordinary primitive recursion uniformly in function parameters, for details see e.g. [6](II.1) or <ref> [21] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1.7 Every ff (&lt; ! (! ! ) )-recursive (i.e. T 1 -definable) function (including the Ack ermann function) is provably recursive in PRA 2 + PCM . Together with the fact that PRA 2 +AC 0;0 -qf+WKL is 0 2 -conservative over PRA (see <ref> [22] </ref> and for more general results [8]) this yields Corollary 1.8 PRA 2 +AC 0;0 -qf+WKL `= PCM (this holds a fortiori for BW , A-A and Limsup instead of PCM ). Theorem 1.9 Let P be PCM , BW or A-A .

Reference-contexts: Remark 5.7 Proposition 5.5 in particular yields that relatively to EA 2 the principle PCM:j 8f PCM (f ) implies CA ar . For RCA 0 instead of EA 2 this implication is stated in [4]. A proof (which is different from our proof ) can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. Proposition 4.2 and proposition 5.5 together yield (using the fact that finitely many instances of 0 can be coded into a single function and number parameter-free instance) Theorem 5.8 Let A 2 0 3 -theorem of PRA + 0 2 -IA.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is well-known by now, mainly from work done on the program of so-called reverse mathematics (although not using the reverse direction explicitly), that substantial parts of mathematics (and in particular analysis) can be carried out in systems T which are conservative over primitive recursive arithmetic PRA (see <ref> [25] </ref> for a systematic account).

Reference-contexts: In fact in a series of papers we have shown that in many cases even a polynomial bound is guaranteed (see [9],[11],[14] among others). 2) One can argue that PRA formalizes what has been called finitistic reasoning (see e.g. <ref> [26] </ref>). If the conservation of T over PRA has been established finitistically (which is possible for mathematically strong systems T (see [22],[8]), then all the mathematics which can be carried out in T has a finitistic justification (see [24],[25] for a discussion of this).

Reference-contexts: The schema of quantifier-free choice for numbers is given by AC 0;0 -qf : 8x 0 9y 0 A 0 (x; y) ! 9f 8xA 0 (x; f x); where A 0 is a quantifier-free formula. 4 We also consider the binary Konig's lemma as formulated in <ref> [27] </ref>: WKL :j 8f 1 (T (f ) ^ 8x 0 9n 0 (lth (n) = 0 x ^ f (n) = 0 0) ! 9b 1 18x 0 (f (bx) = 0 0)); where b 1 1 :j 8n (bn 1) and T (f ) :j 8n 0 ; m
