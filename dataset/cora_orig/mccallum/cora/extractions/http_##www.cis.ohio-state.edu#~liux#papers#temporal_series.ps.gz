Title: Flexible Object Reconstruction from Temporal Image Series  
Author: Jeremy Loomis Zhaohua Ding Xiuwen Liu Kikuo Fujimura Hideo Ishikawa 
Affiliation: The Ohio State University  
Abstract: The problem considered is flexible object reconstruction from a temporal series of orthogonal silhouette image pairs. The subject of study is a growing plant. Three approaches are examined, namely, (i) a bottom-up method, (ii) a spatial model-based method, and (iii) a spatiotemporal model-based method and their experimental results are presented. For all the three approaches, the plant is encoded by free-form splines, but each uses different construction methods. Merits of the approaches are examined in terms of robustness and accuracy. keywords: Shape representation and recovery, image sequence analysis, nonrigid motion, model-based vision

Reference-contexts: Kumar and Gold-gof [5] use hyperquadrics to estimate nonrigid motion from mammogram images. Deformable superquadrat-ics have also been used for object reconstruction [7]. As for flexible object tracking, much work has been done on energy minimization approaches <ref> [4, 1] </ref>. The approaches are used to identify and track 2D and 3D object boundaries based on 2D images and 3D voxel images. Recently, model-based posture recognition has been actively studied in term of human posture tracking [8, 2, 6].

In [6], a model-based approach is proposed to estimate hand posture. <p> However, this method requires a number of reliable shape parameters to be provided as input in the beginning. Using temporal information to identify shapes in a model-based approach has also been suggested before; e.g., in <ref> [2] </ref>, where future prediction of shapes is used to initiate search. In our problem, where the entire set of images is available for off-line processing, we were able to make more use of temporal information in object recognition.
