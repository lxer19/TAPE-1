Title: Communication Costs in Digital Library Databases  
Author: Bharat Bhargava and Melliyal Annamalai 
Abstract: Digital libraries involve various types of data like text, audio, images and video. The data objects are typically very large and of the order of hundreds and thousands of kilobytes. In a digital library, these data objects are distributed in a wide area network. Retrieving large data objects in a wide area network has a high response time. We have conducted experiments to measure the communication overhead in the response time. We have studied the correlation between communication and size of image, between communication and time of day and the communication delay to various sites in a local and wide area network. Images are amenable to losing data without losing semantics of the image. Lossy compression techniques reduce the quality of the image and reduce the size leading to a lower communication delay. We compared the communication delay between compressed and uncompressed images and studied the overhead due to compression and decompression. This enabled us to study the tradeoff between communication time and quality of the image.

Reference-contexts: The library of Congress has thousands and thousands of books and journals. Number of Sites: The number of locations of information repositories available is increasing everyday. This can be observed by the 300% increase in World Wide Web servers in the past year <ref> [1] </ref>. A digital library database requires access to many more sites containing data than a traditional database where only specialized users access data. A site could be where a user is lo cated or database is stored. <p> The number of new Internet users will increase with home computers. Communication depends on many factors bandwidth, number of hops, traffic, reliability of links and hosts, and protocols. We have performed experiments to study the impact of communication in providing distributed digital library services <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. <p> To measure response time we have conducted experiments to measure compression and decompression time <ref> [1] </ref>. We briefly present the results here. We used JPEG as our compression scheme and GIF files to represent uncompressed files. We observed that there is no clear correlation between the file size and the time taken to compress and decompress the file.

Reference-contexts: The number of new Internet users will increase with home computers. Communication depends on many factors bandwidth, number of hops, traffic, reliability of links and hosts, and protocols. We have performed experiments to study the impact of communication in providing distributed digital library services <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. <p> Query processing will be an iterative process with the Fig. 7. Transmission of 10% JPEG files is viable for large network distances user refining his query at each step based on system output. Such a process can be communication intensive <ref> [2] </ref>. When communication is free, this has no effect on response time. This gives the users more flexibility while searching. Indexing and Searching: Now the time spent for indexing and searching is a small percentage of the response time in a distributed system because of the dominance of communication cost.

Reference-contexts: Such an infrastructure will have a major impact in all walks of life students, businessmen, researchers, engineers, government, and the general public. Communication services are critical in digital libraries since the global information infrastructure is inherently distributed <ref> [3] </ref>. First, the users are distributed, and the data needs to be shared by many users. Second, data is distributed since the data is generated at different sources and the size of data makes it difficult to store it at one site. <p> We are also working on request on demand techniques to reduce communication delay for video data. Due to space limitations, the results are not discussed here but will be presented in the formal talk. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Communication Costs for Image Data Image data can be stored, viewed, and manipulated in multiple resolutions. Careful manipulation of the image will result in an image which has reduced size but no visible loss of information. <p> Variation of Transmission Time with File Quality with Time of Day namically changing these parameters to adapt to current network bandwidth availability. We are also working on request on demand techniques where video frames are displayed as they are retrieved. We have achieved a 10% increase in performance <ref> [3] </ref> by incorporating the request on demand technique in Berkeley's MPEG PLAY. 4 Impact on Digital Libraries if Communication is Free Our experiments have shown that communication costs dominate the response time in a wide area network.

Reference-contexts: Third, information processing is distributed, and particularly, the user's queries can be so complicated that the process of information retrieval requires multiple rounds of interactions between users and the various servers of the information system. Communication has been a bottleneck in the success of distributed applications <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. In a wide area network environment, the anamolies (failures, load on the network, message traffic) can affect its effectiveness and utilization. Computer networks for digital library data have the additional problem that each media has its own communication requirements.

Reference-contexts: In the case of text, users can read only one screenful at a time and text data objects can be segmented to be transmitted page by page. Several researchers are working on text compression and retrieval from a document database <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper we present our results for image data objects. We are also working on request on demand techniques to reduce communication delay for video data. Due to space limitations, the results are not discussed here but will be presented in the formal talk.

Reference-contexts: Parallel Processing: When communication is free, all parallel processing algorithms can be applied to a distributed environment. Several complex fractal coding algorithms can be executed using a parallel algorithm in a distributed environment making the use fractal coding viable for indexing images <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Conclusions We have seen that communication cost is a dominant factor and a major bottleneck in the realization of digital libraries. For images, we have explored the option of reducing the size of the data without losing the semantic content.

Reference-contexts: We observed that since TCP implementations avoid sending small messages (so that network capacity is not wasted) the small 53 byte ATM cells are delayed and thus there is no significant performance improvement.

In a wide area network environment, the anamolies (failures, load on the network, message traffic) can affect its effectiveness and utilization. Computer networks for digital library data have the additional problem that each media has its own communication requirements. <p> Our communication experiments have been divided into two parts: LAN and WAN. We have made measurements at different times of day to also measure the communication delay due to network traffic. Experimental Procedure It is difficult to have computer accounts in more than one administrative domain <ref> [8] </ref>. We need to conduct experiments across the Internet. Since we do not have an account on the remote computer, we designed a TCPecho program which uses a TCP client to echo a file using port 7 on the specified remote machine.
