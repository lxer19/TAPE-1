Abstract: This class is an introductory class for CS6104: Algorithmic Number Theory. The syllabus and motivations for the class are covered. Following the introductory material, we begin a review of number theory.

Reference-contexts: Prerequisites for the class include a course in algorithm analysis and a course in probability. A course in abstract algebra covering groups, rings, and fields is also helpful. The textbook for the course is Algorithmic Number Theory, Vol. 1: Efficient Algorithms by Bach and Shallit <ref> [1] </ref> 1 . As the title of the textbook suggests, the main focus of the course is algorithms for problems that can be efficiently solved. Towards the end of the class, other topics not in the text may also be covered. See the syllabus for more details.

Reference-contexts: Homework submissions must be given in L A T E X. 2 Motivations The theory of numbers is an interesting topic. It provides fun problems such as those given in Beiler <ref> [2] </ref>. Also, it is the source of classic problems such as Fermat's "Last Theorem", which was proved recently by A. Wiles and R. Taylor. The statement of Fermat's Theorem is simple, but its proof eluded mathematicians for hundreds of years. Theorem 2.1 (Fermat's Last Theorem).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.1 (Fermat's Last Theorem). There exists no nontrivial integer solutions to x n + y n = z n for n &gt; 2. More recently, number theory plays an important role in cryptography. The RSA <ref> [3] </ref> public key encryption scheme relies on the assumption that factoring large numbers is a difficult task, even for powerful computers.
