Abstract: Various aspects of the theory of random walks on graphs are surveyed. In particular, estimates on the important parameters of access time, commute time, cover time and mixing time are discussed. Connections with the eigenvalues of graphs and with electrical networks, and the use of these connections in the study of random walks is described. We also sketch recent algorithmic applications of random walks, in particular to the problem of sampling.

Reference-contexts: It is conjectured that the graph with smallest cover time is the complete graph (whose cover time is n log n, as we have seen, and this is of course independent of the starting distribution). Aldous <ref> [1] </ref> proved that this is true up to a constant factor if the starting point is drawn at random, from the stationary distribution. The asymptotically best possible upper and lower bounds on the cover time given in (b) are recent results of Feige [31,32].

Reference-contexts: For example, is the conductance of a "matroid basis graph" polynomially bounded from below? (A matroid basis graph has all bases of a matroid (E; M) as nodes, two being connected iff their symmetric difference has cardinality 2.) This is proved for graphic matroids (Aldous <ref> [2] </ref>, Broder [15], cf. the proof of Theorem 6.6), and for a larger class of matroids called balanced (Mihail and Feder [30]). It is interesting to note that the property of graphic matroids that allows this proof to go through is inequality (4.1) for the number of spanning trees. <p> As another result leading up the question of "exact stopping rules", let us describe a method due to Aldous <ref> [2] </ref> and Broder [15], generating a random spanning tree in a graph, so that each spanning tree is returned with exactly the same probability. Theorem 6.6.

Applications of the cover time and commute time bounds Perhaps the first application of random walk techniques in computer science was the following (Aleliunas, Karp, Lipton, Lovasz and Rackoff <ref> [4] </ref>). Let G = (V; E) be a connected d-regular graph, v 0 2 V (G), and assume that at each node, the ends of the edges incident with the node are labelled 1; 2; : : :; d.

Reference-contexts: Sinclair and Jerrum [62] established a connection between the spectral gap and the conductance of the graph. A similar result for the related, but somewhat different parameter called expansion rate was proved by Alon <ref> [5] </ref> and, independently, by Dodziuk and Kendall [24]; cf. also Diaconis and Stroock [21].

As another example, consider the fundamental problem of finding the volume of a convex body.

Here is the general idea. <p> This property of the Metropolis filter is fundamental in some of its applications. Unfortunately, techniques to estimate the mixing time (or the conductance) of a Metropolis-filtered walk are not general enough, and not too many succesful examples are known. One notable exception is the work of Applegate and Kannan <ref> [8] </ref>, who proved that random walks on the lattice points in a convex body, filtered by a smooth log-concave function, mix essentially as fast as the corresponding unfiltered walk. They applied this technique to volume computation.

Reference-contexts: Stopping rules exist for quite general Markov chains. Asmussen, Glynn and Thorisson <ref> [9] </ref> describe a randomized algorithm that generates an element from the stationary distribution of a finite irreducible Markov chain, which needs only the number of states and a "black box" that accepts a state as an input and then simulates a step from this state. <p> Random Walks on Graphs: A Survey 41 To indicate the flavor of the result, let us describe the case when the Markov chain has two states. The general case follows by a (not quite trivial) recursive construction (similarly as in the work of Asmussen, Glynn and Thorisson <ref> [9] </ref>). So let be an irreducible aperiodic Markov chain on states fu; vg. Irreducible means that the transition probabilities p uv , p vu are positive; aperiodocity means that at least one of p uu and p vv is also positive.

Let V be the set of elements we want to enumerate. The size of V is typically exponentially large in terms of the natural "size" k of the problem.

Lovasz The results of Coppersmith, Tetali and Winkler <ref> [19] </ref> discussed above served to solve the following problem: let us start two random walks on a graph simultaneously; how long does it take before they collide? There are variations depending on whether the two random walks step simultaneously, alternatingly, or in one of several other possible ways. <p> How long does this take? Let M (u; v) denote the expected number of steps before two random walks, starting from nodes u and v, collide. It is clear that M (u; v) H (u; v) (v may never wake up to move). Coppersmith, Tetali and Winkler <ref> [19] </ref> prove the nice inequality M (u; v) H (u; v) + H (v; w) H (w; u) for some vertex w. Thus it follows that the collision time is O (n 3 ). 3.

Other results by Elekes [29] and Barany and Furedi [12] show that for general convex bodies (given by, say, a separation oracle; see (Grotschel, Lovasz and Schrijver <ref> [35] </ref>) for background information on the complexity of geometric algorithms) even to compute an estimate with bounded relative error takes exponential time, and the relative error of any polynomial time computable estimate grows exponentially with the dimension.

Reference-contexts: This proof method has many applications (Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [36] </ref>, Diaconis and Stroock [21], Fill [34]). But what are its limitations, i.e., how close can we get to the true conductance? An important theorem of Leighton and Rao [47] shows that we never lose more than a factor of O (log n). Theorem 5.9. <p> This method for generating a random element from a combinatorial structure was initiated by Broder [14] for the problem of approximating the number of perfect matchings in a graph. A proof of the polynomiality of the method was given by Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [36] </ref> for the case of graphs 34 L. Lovasz with minimum degree at least n=2. Whether the method can be modified to handle the case of sparse graph is an open problem. Let us sketch this important result.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, if we replace the circuit with the complete graph, we get a similar result. Answering a question of Graham, it was proved by Lovasz and Winkler <ref> [53] </ref> that no other graph has such a property. This follows from the next result, which verifies in a sense the intuition that the last node visited is more likely to be "far" than "near".

Reference-contexts: Lovasz and Winkler <ref> [54] </ref> have found a randomized stopping rule that generates an element from the stationary distribution of any irreducible Markov chain, and only needs to know the number of states. This rule can be made deterministic under the assumption that the chain is aperiodic.

Reference-contexts: Lovasz and Winkler <ref> [55] </ref> have shown that there is a function t that gives a threshold rule that is optimal among all stopping rules in a very strong sense: it minimizes the expected number of steps among all randomized stopping rules (for a fixed starting node).

Reference-contexts: Access time and cover time The access times and commute times of a random walk have many nice properties and are relatively easy to handle. The cover time is more elusive.

Reference-contexts: So can be viewed as a certain measure of how independent consecutive nodes of the random walk are. Sinclair and Jerrum <ref> [62] </ref> established a connection between the spectral gap and the conductance of the graph.

Reference-contexts: There is also a way to express access times in terms of commute times, due to Tetali <ref> [63] </ref>: H (i; j) = 2 (i; j) + u ! This formula can be proved using either eigenvalues or the electrical resistance formulas (sections 3 and 4). (b) The cover time (starting from a given distribution) is the expected number of steps to reach every node. <p> Then the force 22 L. Lovasz pulling the nails is 1 = (s; t) The energy of the system is 1 = (s; t) Note that equation (2.1) can be used to express access times in terms of resistances or spring forces (Tetali <ref> [63] </ref>). Proof. By construction (b), st (v) is the voltage of v if we put a current through G from s to t, where the voltage of s is 0 and the voltage of t is 1.
