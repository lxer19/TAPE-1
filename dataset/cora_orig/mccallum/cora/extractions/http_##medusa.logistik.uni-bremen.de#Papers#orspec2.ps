Title: A Generalized Permutation Approach to Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Algorithms  
Author: Christian Bierwirth

Affiliation: Department of Economics, University of Bremen,  
Abstract: In order to sequence the tasks of a job shop problem (JSP) on a number of machines related to the technological machine order of jobs, a new representation technique mathematically known as "permutation with repetition" is presented. The main advantage of this single chromosome representation is in analogy to the permutation scheme of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that it cannot produce illegal sets of operation sequences (infeasible symbolic solutions). As a consequence of the representation scheme a new crossover operator preserving the initial scheme structure of permutations with repetition will be sketched. Its behavior is similar to the well known Order-Crossover for simple permutation schemes. Actually the GOX operator for permutations with repetition arises from a Generalisation of OX. Computational experiments show, that GOX passes the information from a couple of parent solutions efficiently to offspring solutions. Together, the new representation and GOX support the cooperative aspect of the genetic search for scheduling problems strongly.

Reference-contexts: The recombination strategy works as follows: Crossover via GOX is only performed if the integer valued fitness of mating individuals differs, otherwise a position-based mutation takes place. The derived Generalized-Permutation GA (GP-GA) was tested on a suite of 12 well-known benchmark problems provided by Applegate and Cook <ref> [1] </ref>. In all runs the population size was set to 100. Selection is done by the ranking scheme "40%, 30%, 20%, 10%" in a 4-element neighborhood. The accepted worsening of offspring was set to 1%.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2. Distribution of 100 solutions of the Muth-Thompson benchmarks. 5 Computational Results The described representation and GOX were embedded into a distributed genetic optimization environment called Parnet. The distribution model of Par-net bases on "isolation-by-distance" within a structured population (for details see Bierwirth/Kopfer/Mattfeld/Utecht <ref> [2] </ref>). In this population model individuals reside on a ring. Mate-selection is done by neighborhood ranking and offspring-acceptance is done locally. The recombination strategy works as follows: Crossover via GOX is only performed if the integer valued fitness of mating individuals differs, otherwise a position-based mutation takes place.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since the publication of Davis paper in 1985 <ref> [3] </ref> a lot of research in the field of production scheduling with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) has been done. The main difficulty in this subject arises from the question of how to represent the problem in the algorithm, which is known to be most important for genetic search.

That is why semiac-tive scheduling allows to generate optimal solution from the new representation for a wide range of performance-measures. Computational experiments showed, that genetic optimization of the minimum-makespan-JSP improves by the use of a more powerful schedule-builder, in particular an active scheduler.

Reference-contexts: Computational experiments showed, that genetic optimization of the minimum-makespan-JSP improves by the use of a more powerful schedule-builder, in particular an active scheduler. This observation is in common with Dorn-dorf/Pesch and Nakano/Yamada, who used the Gi*er-Thompson algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> as an active scheduling-procedure. An active schedule-builder performs a kind of local-search, which can be used to introduce heuristic-improvement into genetic search. This strategy, first used by Nakano/Yamada, is called forcing. Forcing allows the schedule-builder to modify a chromosome if a permissible left shift of a task is detected.

Reference-contexts: For la27 and la38 new best solutions were recently found by a GA. This algorithm uses the Generalized-Permutation approach presented in this paper. But in contrast to GP-GA it is hybridized by more powerful local-search techniques <ref> [7] </ref>. Table 2 shows the best-of-all and the average makespan generated by GP-GA. The average solutions of all problems are within 0.7% to 7.2% of the best-known values whereas the best-found solutions differ by only 0% to 4.5%.

Reference-contexts: The binary representations of this problem led to difficulties which could be avoided by the use of a simple permutation representation. As a consequence many permutation-crossover operators were developed; for a comparison see Oliver/Smith/Holland <ref> [9] </ref>. This section presents a new genetic representation of the JSP, which follows the third alternative. The representation is "complete" in the way, that it covers all feasible solutions of a JSP but no infeasible one. <p> As an additional desirable feature the crossover operator should enable inheritance of counting-indices of genes within subsequences whenever possible. For the first reason the new operator was modeled on the Order-Crossover (OX) for simple permutation schemes <ref> [9] </ref>. OX is known to transmit the relative node positions of two permutations quite well to offspring. A straight-forward Generalisation of OX to permutations with repetition allows the integration of a technique, which includes the inheritance-feature into the operator GOX. To illustrate GOX the chromosome of figure 1 is used.

Computational results appear in table 2. The column "Known" refers to the best-known or optimal solutions of the ten problems. Seven values are taken from a recent paper of Pesch <ref> [10] </ref>. Meanwhile la29 was solved by Tabu-Search with a makespan of 1180. This result was achieved by Taillard and is as far as we know still unpublished. For la27 and la38 new best solutions were recently found by a GA. This algorithm uses the Generalized-Permutation approach presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulty in this subject arises from the question of how to represent the problem in the algorithm, which is known to be most important for genetic search. Some researchers approached the JSP from a TSP's point of view, e. g. Whitley/Starkweather <ref> [13] </ref>. Beside a fundamental obstacle that will be discussed and removed by this paper two important advantages arise from the connectivity of both problem areas.
