Title: Clique Detection as a Royal Road Function  
Author: Thomas Haynes 
Address: Wichita, KS 67260  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Wichita State University  
Abstract: Royal Road functions manipulate the fitness landscape to provide controlled experiments into genetic algorithm (GA) theory [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] . Variations of clique detection in a graph, e.g., finding both the max clique [ Soule et al., 1996 ] and the clique cover [ Haynes, 1996 ] , have been proposed as naturally occurring Royal Road functions. Soule and Foster have tried to positively correlate different graph families to various measures of GA hardness [ Soule and Foster, 1997 ] . We present a systematic approach to determining the relevant characteristics. We investigate graphs for which simple search algorithms, e.g., random search, hill climbing, and simulated annealing, should easily determine both the max clique and the clique cover.

Reference-contexts: There can also be a duplication of building blocks in a GP chromosome, whereas there may not be any such duplication in a GA chromosome. Altenberg applies Price's Theorem to account for the multiple appearance of a subtree within a chromosome <ref> [ Altenberg, 1994 ] </ref> . He believes that the schema theorem can not account for the proliferation of copies of subtrees and introduces a "constructional fitness" to account for such proliferation.

Reference-contexts: If we vary the representation used in the chromosome, then the clique domain does satisfy the necessary criteria to be a Royal Road function for a grouping GA <ref> [ Falkenauer, 1995 ] </ref> . Royal Roads are a tool GA researchers can use to both investigate the formation of building blocks and test GAs against other paradigms [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] . <p> They are integral to the schema theorem, which defines how the implicit parallel search of a GA "builds" better solutions over time [ Holland, 1975, Goldberg, 1989 ] . The grouping GA <ref> [ Falkenauer, 1995 ] </ref> behaves more like a GP than a binary or order based GA. The canonical GP chromosome representation is a parse tree (S-expression). The difference between GA and GP is more than the fixed versus variable genotype representation. <p> The GA encoding of Bui and Eppley could not maintain several candidate cliques in a single chromosome. Soule and Foster utilize a grouping GA <ref> [ Falkenauer, 1995 ] </ref> to maintain multiple candidate cliques in the chromosome. They fix the number of initial groups in a chromosome to be initially 30 and slowly reduce it to 4.

Reference-contexts: Reproduction by itself introduces no new solutions to the population of solutions. The basic GA algorithm employs two other operators, crossover and mutation, to change the solutions which have been selected via reproduction <ref> [ Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> . Instead of directly creating a population of k chromosomes, selection first creates a pool of k parents. Two parents are then selected, without replacement, from this pool to exchange genetic material to form two children. <p> The average fitness of the chromosomes per generation is likely to increase and over time the system converges to a "good" solution, i.e., close to optimal. The repetitive application of evaluation and selection has been shown to efficiently solve a variety of problems in many different domains <ref> [ Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> . The canonical GA chromosome, or string, representation utilizes a binary alphabet: f0; 1g. If a don't care symbol, i.e. either 0 or 1 can appear is utilized, we have the schemata alphabet f0; 1; flg. <p> They are integral to the schema theorem, which defines how the implicit parallel search of a GA "builds" better solutions over time <ref> [ Holland, 1975, Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> . The grouping GA [ Falkenauer, 1995 ] behaves more like a GP than a binary or order based GA. The canonical GP chromosome representation is a parse tree (S-expression). <p> We used linear scaling, with the maximum expected offspring being 2.0 <ref> [ Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> . The other algorithms had a probability of 0.01 per bit for mutation. This was set higher than the probability of mutation for the GA to offset the effects of both maintaining a population of solutions and crossover.

Reference-contexts: The properties which make the clique domain ideally suited as a Royal Road function for genetic programming (GP) have been independently reported in <ref> [ Haynes, 1996 ] </ref> and [ Soule et al., 1996 ] . However, it has been shown that the clique domain does not serve as a Royal Road function for binary encoded GAs [ Soule et al., 1996 ] . <p> We have also used a GP approach to find all cliques in a graph <ref> [ Haynes, 1996 ] </ref> . As our goal was clique cover, we designed the encoding to represent multiple candidate cliques in the chromosome. Instead of a single Union operator, we employed one (IntCon) to join vertices into a subgraph and one (ExtCon) to connect subgraphs together into a list. <p> They were unable to associate any of these measures with the difficulty of the GA to solve a particular graph. 4.2 A GA Encoding We have adapted our GP encoding <ref> [ Haynes, 1996 ] </ref> to a GA encoding. We fix a maximum number of positions, have a vertex encoding, and utilize a grouping GA to allow for a variable number of candidate cliques in a chromosome. <p> While increasing the chromosome length will boost the search, there exists a limit to the chromosome length for even moderately sized graphs. We have found duplication of coding segments <ref> [ Haynes, 1996 ] </ref> , collective memory [ Haynes, 1997b ] and local search [ Haynes, 1997a ] to extend the processing of a genetic programming based search engine and we expect the same results would hold with each of the search heuristics we have utilized in these experiments.

Clique detection is difficult for all of these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: With a good test-bed, researchers will be able to not only compare two distinct algorithms, but also investigate characteristics of a particular approach. Within the genetic algorithm (GA) community, a class of such problems, called the Royal Road functions, have been identified <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . In this paper, in the spirit of Mitchell, Forrest, and Holland, we will investigate such a domain, that of finding cliques in a graph [ Bron and Kerbosch, 1973 ] . <p> Royal Roads are a tool GA researchers can use to both investigate the formation of building blocks and test GAs against other paradigms <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . The GA researcher can utilize a Royal Road function to carefully craft a fitness landscape, which will allow for controlled experiments to test properties of the GA and other search heuristics. <p> An irony of Royal Road functions is while they are designed to facilitate the hierarchical solving of problems via building blocks, in practice they hinder the integration of building blocks, e.g., hitchhiking <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . <p> The distinction is subtle, but critical for understanding the characteristics of building blocks in GP chromosomes. Royal Road functions represent fitness landscapes which facilitate the testing and understanding of how the GA works <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . By explicitly designing the fitness function to encourage building blocks, the performance of the GA can be tested. Consider the 1s problem, i.e., with a fixed binary string, the global optimum is having a 1 in each bit. <p> For example, if crossover causes s 1 and s 2 to be joined, then we also have s 9 . The desired effect is to force the application of the Schemata Theorem. The actual results indicated that the building blocks were not being exploited <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1992 ] </ref> . 4 Clique Cover A collection of cliques in a graph can be represented as a list of a list of vertices which, in turn, can be represented by a tree structure.

Reference-contexts: They point out that the arguments provided by O'Reilly and Op-pacher against a GP Schema Theorem fail for this domain <ref> [ O'Reilly and Oppacher, 1995 ] </ref> : subtrees do not interact adversely and subtrees represent hyperplanes of the fitness landscape. We have also used a GP approach to find all cliques in a graph [ Haynes, 1996 ] .

The GA encoding of Bui and Eppley could not maintain several candidate cliques in a single chromosome.
