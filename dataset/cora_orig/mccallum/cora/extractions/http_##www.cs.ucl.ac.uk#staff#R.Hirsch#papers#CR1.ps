Reference-contexts: Next, it can be shown that !-saturation is sufficient to imply that 9 has a winning strategy for G ! (N; B). Finally, use <ref> [Chang and Keisler1973] </ref> theorem 6.1.1 which says that B is ! 1 -saturated.] Instead we prove the result directly. In G ! (N; B) let 8 play (e; a; b), so e is an edge of N and a; b are atoms of B such that a; b N (e). <p> Let B j+1 be a countable, elementary subalgebra containing S in B (follows from downward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski theorem, or see <ref> [Chang and Keisler1973] </ref> theorem 3.1.6). By construction, if 8 plays only atoms from B j , then 9 can win the play while only choosing atomic B j+1 -networks. Now let A 0 be the union of the chain A 0 = S j B j . <p> Now let A 0 be the union of the chain A 0 = S j B j . Then A 0 is an elementary extension of each B j (elementary chain theorem, <ref> [Chang and Keisler1973] </ref> theorem 3.1.13) hence elementary equivalent to B and A. Furthermore, 9 has a winning strategy for the game G ! (;; A 0 ).

Reference-contexts: The proof uses an ultrapower construction. The results are presented in a game-theoretic framework and this is for a number of reasons. Firstly, the game-theoretic method has been used effectively to simplify and clarify quite difficult problems in the field <ref> [Hirsch and HodkinsonSubmitted] </ref>. This is largely because the goal of the second player is to build a representation or, in effect, to prove the theorem. This makes the proof natural. Secondly, we believe that techniques in game-theory should become standard scientific methods, just like proof by induction.

Reference-contexts: A relation algebra is simple if every non-zero element r satisfies 1; r; 1 = 1 Every relation algebra can be decomposed as a direct sum of simple relation algebras <ref> [Jonsson and Tarski1948] </ref>. An integral relation algebra satisfies a; b = 0 ) (a = 0) _ (b = 0). A relation algebra is integral if and only if the identity is an atom.

Reference-contexts: Complete representations have the additional property that they preserve arbitrary unions (hence intersections too), wherever these unions are defined. Historically, there has been a certain confusion here with complete and arbitrary representations at times being mistaken for each other (e.g. <ref> [Lyndon1950] </ref>). Representation classes - i.e. a class of all structures of the appropriate type possessing a representation form varieties in almost every case in algebraic logic. <p> 1 ; : : : ; N i1 ; m; n; r; s). oe is a winning strategy for 9 if in any play of G ! (N; A) where 9 always uses oe she is guaranteed to win the play. [It can be shown that the ith-level Lyndon conditions <ref> [Lyndon1950] </ref> are equivalent to saying that 9 has a winning strategy for G i (;; A).

Reference-contexts: To use the terminology of <ref> [Maddux1978] </ref>, this is equivalent to saying that A has an i-dimensional basis.] Definition Let N be an atomic network and h : A ! P (X fi X) a representation of A.

Reference-contexts: THEOREM 4 Let h be a representation of a relation algebra. h is a complete representation if and only if it is an atomic representation. But corollary 3 does not carry over to relation algebras: there are atomic (in fact finite) relation algebras with no representation at all (e.g. <ref> [McKenzie1970] </ref> page 286), the so-called point algebra with three atoms &lt;; &gt;; = has only infinite representations [Villain and Kautz1986] and there are atomic, representable relation algebra possessing no complete representations ([Maddux1978] pages 154 - 173, or see theorem 10 herein).
