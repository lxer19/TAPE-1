Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Texas at  
Abstract: We prove an (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for the depth of sorting networks based on the shu*e permutation. This settles an open question posed by Knuth, up to a fi(lg lg n) factor. The proof technique employed in the lower bound argument may be of separate interest.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A variety of different classes of sorting networks have been described in the literature. Of particular interest here are the so-called AKS network <ref> [1] </ref> discovered by Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi, and the sorting network proposed by Batcher [2]. The AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth. <p> The AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth. However, the topology of the network is highly irregular, and the multiplicative constant hidden by the O-notation is impractically large <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. On the other hand, the network proposed by Batcher has a relatively simple interconnection structure and a small constant. This makes it the network of choice in many practical applications, although the network has depth fi (lg 2 n) and is thus asymptotically worse than AKS.

Reference-contexts: Another class of particular interest are small-depth sorting networks based on hypercubic networks (e.g., the hypercube, butterfly, cube-connected cycles, and shu*e-exchange). In this context, Cypher <ref> [4] </ref> has shown that the AKS network cannot be emulated on the cube-connected-cycles in o (lg 2 n) time. This paper focuses on sorting networks based on the shu*e permutation, a notion that is formalized below.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show an (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for the class of networks based on the shu*e permutation, thereby answering a question posed (as an open problem) by Knuth in Exercise 5.3.4.47 of <ref> [5] </ref>, up to a fi (lg lg n) factor. The best previously known lower bound for this class was the trivial (lg n) bound, while the best known upper bound continues to be given by Batcher's fi (lg 2 n)-depth sorting network.

Reference-contexts: In fact, our lower bound holds for a slighly more general class, the so-called delta networks (see, for example, <ref> [6] </ref>). Interestingly, the result cannot be extended to the case where both the shu*e permutation and the unshu*e operation 1 are allowed in the network.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, the result cannot be extended to the case where both the shu*e permutation and the unshu*e operation 1 are allowed in the network. For that case, the "randomized" construction of Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref> has been shown to imply the existence of sorting networks (in the usual sense) with nearly logarithmic depth [9]. <p> Hence, the validity of the argument is not affected by allowing the construction of the network to be adaptive. Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref> have designed a shu*e-unshu*e comparator network (i.e., a comparator network in which the permutation between successive levels can be either shu*e or unshu*e) of depth O (lg n) that sorts all but a superpolynomially small fraction of the inputs. <p> A similar argument can be used to show that we cannot hope to extend the lower bound to the "randomized" complexity of shu*e-based sorting networks. In order to construct a randomized shu*e-unshu*e network that sorts all inputs with high probability, Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref> use an additional "randomizing" circuit element that interchanges the input values with probability 1=2, and leaves them unchanged otherwise. This new element can be used to construct a shu*e-based randomized sorter of depth O (lg n lg lg n). <p> Since this would contradict our lower bound, we can conclude that there does not exist a representative set of polynomial size. This argument can be strengthened somewhat. The technique of Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref> can also be used to construct a o (lg 2 n= lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based sorting network that sorts all but an * = 2 2 o (lg n= lg lg n) fraction of the inputs.

Reference-contexts: For that case, the "randomized" construction of Leighton and Plaxton [7] has been shown to imply the existence of sorting networks (in the usual sense) with nearly logarithmic depth <ref> [9] </ref>. Thus, one way of viewing the lower bound of this paper is that it establishes a non-trivial separation between the power of "ascend-descend" machines (e.g., the shu*e-exchange when both shu*ing and unshu*ing are permitted) and strict "ascend" machines (e.g., shu*e only). <p> Assuming the existence of a representative set of polynomial size, and using Corollary 4.2.1 of <ref> [9] </ref>, the existence of an O (lg n lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based network for sorting all but a polynomially small fraction of the inputs implies the existence of a o (lg 2 n= lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based sorting network.

Reference-contexts: It should be pointed out that this allows an arbitrary fixed permutation between any two consecutive delta networks, due to the definition of serial composition. It has been shown that any permutation can be routed by two consecutive forward butterfly networks <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus, eliminating the permutations between the delta networks would only increase the depth of the circuit by at most a constant factor. A comparator network fl was defined as a map ping from the set of inputs to the set of outputs.
