Abstract: We propose a new condition to test for the impossibility of jamming in three-dimensional, quasistatic multi-rigid-body systems. Our condition can be written as a feasibility problem for a system of linear inequalities and therefore can be checked using linear programming techniques. To demonstrate the use of our jamming test, we apply it to a simple dexterous manipulation task and to the well-known peg-in-hole insertion problem.

Reference-contexts: However, progress has been slow for general systems. Several authors have studied the jamming of (nominally) rigid parts, but this has been done mostly for special geometries, such as a peg and a hole (see <ref> [1, 8, 12] </ref>). Donald and Pai [3], and later Dupont [4] developed jamming analyses for systems with more general geometries. Donald and Pai's work grew out of the development of a simulator designed to test plans for assembling compliant parts. <p> Our explanation for this result is that previous form closure results do not take the kinematic structure of the grasping mechanism into account, but we do here. 4.2 Jamming Example: Peg-in-Hole The peg-in-hole insertion problem (see Figure 3) has been studied in great depth (so to speak) by <ref> [12, 8, 1] </ref>. It was found by Whitney, that the peg is most likely to jam when there are two points of contact and the insertion depth is small.

However, we reserve the use of the term "force closure" for situations originally identified by Reuleaux [7]. different at the two contacts). When the coefficients of friction were zero, so were the elements of the jamming matrix.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we used Omata's idea to replace the two friction cones on the palm by a single "equivalent" friction cone <ref> [6] </ref>). This cone has its apex 2 distance units below the center of the bottom of the block and its edges are colinear with the outer edges of the two individual friction cones. This cone and the cone on the finger do not "see each other" until x &gt; 1:0.

Reference-contexts: Further, we will assume that the conditions of first-order stability with friction <ref> [9] </ref> are met by the manipulation plan. <p> These matrices are partitions of the Jacobian of the positional kinematic constraints associated with the con tacts constraints. At each sliding contact, the direction of the friction force is known and proportional to the normal reaction. Thus we can write the equilibrium equations as <ref> [9] </ref>: W A T t g man : (2) where the unknown c A is referred to as the applicable wrench intensity vector. This vector contains three wrench intensities for each rolling contact, and one wrench intensity for each sliding contact. <p> Jamming cannot be sustained if eq. (3) cannot be satisfied with c iz &gt; 0. Since the trajectory under consideration is first order stable, the matrix in the equilibrium equations can be partitioned to yield (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details): Q II y iII z iII c A c iz = g I t II g manII (4) where Q 1 I exists (the structure of g I will be revealed in the next equation). <p> The above development is summarized by the following theorem and corollary. Theorem 1 An active, three-dimensional, multi--rigid-body system with Coulomb friction acting at the contacts cannot jam if the system of inequalities (9) and (10) is infeasible. Proof: See <ref> [9] </ref> for a proof. Corollary 1 An active, two-dimensional, multi-rigid-body system with Coulomb friction acting at the contacts cannot jam if any row of the matrix, XE J (Z II Q II Q 1 I Z I ), has all nonpositive ele ments.

Reference-contexts: Let _ q 2 R 6 and _ 2 R n , be the generalized velocity vectors of the workpiece and manipulator, respectively, where R n denotes n-dimensional Eu-clidean space. Then the kinematic velocity constraint implied by the planned contact mode is <ref> [11] </ref>: W T where the matrices W T T A have three rows for each rolling contact and one row for each sliding contact (i.e., 3n R + n S , where n R and n S are the numbers of rolling and sliding contacts respectively). <p> In this particularly simple example, the system must jam when x reaches 3=4 (assuming that it begins with x &lt; 3=4). One can show that no other contact mode is possible <ref> [11] </ref>. This result is intuitively appealing, since the torque goes to infinity at x = 3=4. It is interesting to compare the results of the block/hand example with results on frictional form closure.
