Abstract: Monte Carlo simulation using a cluster algorithm is used to compute the scaling part of the free energy for a three dimensional O(4) spin model. The results are relevant for analysis of lattice studies of high temperature QCD.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The high temperature phase transition for QCD with two flavors of light quarks is expected to be driven by chiral symmetry restoration, with an order parameter having O (4) symmetry in the continuum limit <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Thus, near the transition we expect the scaling properties of a three dimensional O (4) spin model. For quark mass or temperature not too close to the transition, the system would be expected to behave like mean field theory.
