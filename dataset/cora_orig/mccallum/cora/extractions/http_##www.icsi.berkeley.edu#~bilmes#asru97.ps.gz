Abstract: In maximum-likelihood based speech recognition systems, it is important to accurately estimate the joint distribution of feature vectors given a particular acoustic model. In this work, we propose that by modeling the joint distribution of time-localized feature vectors and statistics relating those time-localized feature vectors to the relevant acoustic context, we can estimate information contained in the feature-vector joint distribution without the accompanying theoretical or computational difficulties. We introduce the modcrossgram (MCG), a computational way of estimating short-time spectro-temporal correlation-based statistics that are informative about the feature-vector joint distribution. Using the standard hybrid ANN/HMM architecture, we compare a MCG-based speech recognition system with a more traditional one on an isolated word speech database. We show that, in the presence of noise, the MCG-based system achieves a significant reduction in word error rate over the standard system.

An efficient encoding requires information about a joint distribution signals believed likely according to this distribution are encoded more efficiently (i.e., with fewer bits).

Reference-contexts: Speech, like other naturally occurring signals (including noise), has unique statistics <ref> [2] </ref>. Directly modeling the distribution of speech statistics, such as correlations, might therefore lead to a system less sensitive to noise whose statistics are not speech-like.

Reference-contexts: The MCG system, however, shows a significant word error decrease over jrasta alone (p &lt; 0:002 using a difference of proportions significance test) in the noisy test condition. This value, 8.35%, is insignificantly different then the overall best error rate our group has achieved for this condition <ref> [4] </ref> which requires more training parameters and a more complicated recognition process.

Reference-contexts: If the statistics are nearly sufficient, then they are nearly as informative about X t as is any parameter (such as Q t ) governing X t 's distribution <ref> [5] </ref> - this, therefore, could reduce the burden normally placed on the variable Q t to contain all the crucial information about X t . While not stated in the same way, others have shown that such an approach can reduce word error in speech recognition systems.

Reference-contexts: While not stated in the same way, others have shown that such an approach can reduce word error in speech recognition systems. For example, one statistic that has shown success in many systems is delta features <ref> [8] </ref>. In this case, X t are typically cepstral features, S (X t ) d dt X t , and we model an approximation of the joint distribution of base features and their temporal derivatives, or P (X t ; d dt X t jQ t ).

Reference-contexts: While we tested a variety of lengths for the correlation and context window, it is interesting to note that the resulting best values, 50ms and 212.5ms respectively, are close to the 40ms time quanta and 200ms integration period that may be crucial time-constants in the mammalian auditory system <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 These jrasta-only results are slightly better than those reported in previous papers as the experiments were re-run and re-tuned to a new recognition system. 4 Visual Example In this section, through visual display, we offer an explanation as to how MCG based features could help recognition in the presence

Reference-contexts: One underlying goal in these systems, therefore, is to estimate P (X t jQ t ), 1 the conditional distribution of the features at time-frame t given the current hidden Markov state variable. Unfortunately, as has been observed <ref> [16, 14] </ref>, such a measure can lead to an inaccurate estimate of the actual distribution of X t because there is no explicit dependenceon the germane acoustic and linguistic context. <p> Alternatively, one can model the distribution of X t (or perhaps some segment surrounding X t ) conditioned on additional variables along with the distribution of those additional variables (see <ref> [14] </ref>, and the references contained therein), but this approach adds both theoretical and computational complexity.
