Abstract: Human vision systems integrate information nonlocally, across long spatial ranges. For example, a moving stimulus appears smeared when viewed briefly (30 ms), yet sharp when viewed for a longer exposure (100 ms) (Burr, 1980). This suggests that visual systems combine information along a trajectory that matches the motion of the stimulus. Our self-organizing neural network model shows how developmental exposure to moving stimuli can direct the formation of horizontal trajectory-specific motion integration pathways that unsmear representations of moving stimuli. These results account for Burr's data and can potentially also model other phenomena, such as visual inertia.

Reference-contexts: Examples include: attentional modulation of receptive field shape; modulation of neural response by stimuli beyond the classical receptive field; and neural response to large-field background motion. In this paper we present a model of the development of nonlocal neural mechanisms for visual motion processing. Our model <ref> (Marshall, 1990a, 1991) </ref> is based on the long-range excitatory horizontal intrinsic connections (LEHICs) that have been identified in the visual cortex of a variety of animal species (Blasdel, Lund, & Fitzpatrick, 1985; Callaway & Katz, 1990; Gabbott, Martin, & Whitteridge, 1987; Gilbert & Wiesel, 1989; Luhmann, Martnez Millan, & Singer, 1986; <p> Some characteristics of our modeled LEHICs are also consistent with those of the horizontal connections described by Hirsch & Gilbert (1991). For instance, we predicted <ref> (Marshall, 1990a) </ref> that horizontal excitatory input alone should not cause suprathreshold activation, but horizontal excitatory input should amplify activation when local bottom-up excitation is present. Hirsch & Gilbert (1991) directly observed these characteristics in area 17 pyramidal neurons in the cat. <p> These neurons would be connected through a trajectory-specific chain of time-delayed LEHICs. Lateral inhibition between chains would be organized selectively to allow representations of multiple stimuli to be simultaneously active <ref> (Marshall, 1990a) </ref>, thereby letting most trajectory representations operate independently. Our simulation consists of a 1-D subnetwork of the full 2-D network, with 32 neurons sensitive to a single velocity and direction of motion (Figure 2a). <p> The inaccurate trajectory predictions of such a network would impair its ability to develop or maintain circuits for combining motion measurements <ref> (Marshall, 1990ab) </ref>. We conclude that motion perception systems need to represent explicitly both initial smear and subsequent unsmearing. it will move is uncertain. As the object continues to move, its successor positions become increasingly predictable, in general.

Reference-contexts: Our simulated networks may correspond to structures in such higher areas.
