Abstract: Curves in space are difficult to perceive and analyze, especially when they form dense sets as in typical 3D flow and volume deformation applications. We propose a technique that exposes essential properties of space curves by attaching an appropriate moving coordinate frame to each point, reexpressing that moving frame as a unit quaternion, and supporting interaction with the resulting quaternion field. The original curves in 3-space are associated with piecewise continuous 4-vector quaternion fields, which map into new curves lying in the unit 3-sphere in 4-space. Since 4-space clusters of curves with similar moving frames occur independently of the curves' original proximity in 3-space, a powerful analysis tool results. We treat two separate moving-frame formalisms, the Frenet frame and the parallel-transport frame, and compare their properties. We describe several flexible approaches for interacting with and exploiting the properties of the four-dimensional quaternion fields.

Reference-contexts: Systematic approaches for representing clusters of orientations in 3D spaces of angles have been suggested, for example, by Alpern et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Among previous approaches to visualizing the geometry of space curves, we note the work of Gray [7, 10], which exploits the curvature and torsion scalar fields on a curve for visualization purposes; this method extends naturally to higher-dimensional manifolds with well-defined local curvature. <p> Our fundamental approach singles out space curves, although variations could be used to treat individual point frames (see <ref> [1] </ref>), stream surfaces (see [20]), and orientation differences (which are themselves orientation fields) as well. Thus we begin with the properties of a curve ~ x (t) in 3D space parameterized by the unnormalized arc length t. <p> Some approaches to representing these degrees of freedom in a three-dimensional space were suggested by Alpern et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. We propose instead to systematically exploit the representation of 3D orientation frames in four-dimensions using equivalent unit quaternions that correspond, in turn, to points on the three-sphere (see, e.g., [25]). <p> Displays based on 3D angular coordinates are potentially useful, but lack metric uniformity <ref> [1] </ref>. The 4-vector quaternion frame is potentially a more informative and flexible basis for frame visualizations; below, we discuss several alterna 9 fig6a.eps fig6b.eps fig6c.eps fig6d.eps displayed along knot.

Reference-contexts: All such frames can be recast into quaternion frame coordinates. Orientation spaces and their relationship to quaternions are described in Altmann <ref> [2] </ref>; an interesting approach to the visualization of the properties of quaternions was recently given by Hart, Francis, and Kauffman [19]. Systematic approaches for representing clusters of orientations in 3D spaces of angles have been suggested, for example, by Alpern et al. [1].

Reference-contexts: One is the classic Frenet frame, also called the Frenet-Serret frame (see, e.g., [9, 10]), which is defined locally by the tangent, normal and binormal at each point of each curve; the other is the parallel-transport frame (see, e.g., Bishop <ref> [4] </ref>), which retains the tangent vector, but uses a nonlocal approach borrowed from the parallel-transport methods of differential geometry to compute the frame components in the plane perpendicular to the curve. All such frames can be recast into quaternion frame coordinates. <p> x 000 (t) If we are given a non-vanishing curvature and a torsion as smooth functions of t, we can theoretically integrate the system of equations to find the unique numerical values of the corresponding space curve ~ x (t) (up to a rigid motion). 2.2 Parallel Transport Frames Bishop <ref> [4] </ref> noted that, while the Frenet frame has the advantage of consistent local computability at all points on a curve except those with vanishing second derivative, there is another natural frame, the parallel transport frame, that is well-defined everywhere; the distinguishing feature of the parallel transport frame is that it is <p> One can show that <ref> [4] </ref> (t) = (k 1 ) 2 + (k 2 ) 2 (t) = arctan k 1 t (t) = dt so that k 1 and k 2 effectively correspond to a Cartesian coordinate system for the polar coor dinates ; with = R t (t) dt. <p> It is also worthwhile noting that (k 1 (t); k 2 (t)) form a two-dimensional Cartesian vector field at fig3.eps the curve of Fig. 2 <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by NSF grant IRI-91-06389.

Reference-contexts: Operational methods of defining such frames have been previously noted (see, e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>) but the underlying mathematical basis was not elaborated. Geometrically, the parallel transport frame derives its name from the fact that it corresponds to the notion of moving a vector around a curved manifold in such a way that it remains as parallel to itself as possible. <p> The parallel transport techniques introduced in this paper are in fact extremely relevant to this task, and may be applied to the tubing problem as well (see, e.g., <ref> [5, 18] </ref>). 7.3 3D Rotations of Quaternion Displays Using the 3D rolling ball interface, we can generate quaternion representations of 3D rotations of the form q = (cos 2 ; ^ n sin 2 ) and transform the entire quaternion display by quaternion multiplication, i.e., by changing each point to p
