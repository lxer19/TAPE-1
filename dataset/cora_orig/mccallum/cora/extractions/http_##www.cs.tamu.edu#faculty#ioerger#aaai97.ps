Title: Integrating a Spatial Reasoner with a Resolution Theorem-Prover

Abstract: Some spatial reasoning systems use images to solve problems, rather than making formal logical inferences. However, an open question is how to use these systems in contexts where some nonspatial information is also involved. We present a hybrid reasoning method in which we extend the capabilities of a spatial reasoner by integrating it with a resolution theorem-prover. We prove that the hybrid system is refutation-complete, in the sense that, if a domain theory is unsatisfiable, perhaps only because all of its models entail unrealizable images, then our algorithm will halt. We discuss how our approach differs from other hybrid reasoning algorithms in the way it manages the interaction between sub-systems.

Reference-contexts: Inference with a domain theory in the hybrid language may be conducted by resolution <ref> (Chang & Lee 1973) </ref>. First the theory is converted into clausal form by a sequence of well-known truth-preserving operations (DeMorgan's Laws, skolemization, etc.). Then new clauses are derived by the resolution rule from combinations of existing clauses. <p> If the objects in the spatial domain are known to be fBook,Table,Chairg, then the following clause should be added to the theory: f (Sk1=Book)_ (Sk1=T able)_ (Sk1=Chair)g. An extension of resolution such as paramodulation could be used to handle reasoning with equality in an appropriate manner <ref> (Chang & Lee 1973) </ref>. Covered List A central data structure of the hybrid reasoning algorithm is the Covered List (Cov). The Covered List is a disjunctive-normal form (DNF) expression over the language of spatial literals L S .

While image-based systems have been shown to be useful for solving a variety of spatial problems, an open question is how to use them for reasoning in a context where there is also some non-spatial information.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in spatial or diagrammatic reasoning <ref> (Glasgow, Narayanan, & Chandrasekaran 1995) </ref>. Among the various spatial reasoning systems that have been proposed, there are two basic types of approaches: axiomatic and image-based.

Reference-contexts: Although many strategies have been proposed for choosing the order in which clauses are resolved to help control the complexity in certain situations, resolution in general is known to be NP-complete <ref> (Haken 1985) </ref>. Hybrid Reasoning Algorithm Suppose we are given a domain theory in the hybrid language and a query whose entailment we are to prove.

Reference-contexts: This approach can be used to extend such systems with the ability to reason to outside their domains of expertise. Reasoning Sub-Systems Spatial Component The spatial reasoner we use in this hybrid reasoning system is described in <ref> (Ioerger 1994) </ref>. We begin by defining the formal nature of the images used in the system. Images are essentially array data-structures in which the elements may contain sets of symbols. <p> This hill-climbing approach relies on graded interpretations of the spatial relationships, and the tradeoff between its efficiency and its completeness (probability of finding an appropriate image if it exists) can be adjusted by choosing larger or more restricted sets of manipulations <ref> (Ioerger 1994) </ref>. When a query is made, the system inspects images to determine whether the queried literal is true or false. However, it is possible that the answer might not be exactly as depicted in the current working image. <p> Then the answer to QUERY (Left (A,C)) would appear to be YES but should really be UNSPECIFIED. This is an instance of the Indeterminacy Problem <ref> (Ioerger 1994) </ref>, which stems from the use of complete and specific images to represent incomplete spatial information. <p> The approach that Myers and Konolige (1995) take is to encode some structural uncertainty in images, which can be used to depict a degree of ambiguity in certain details. The spatial reasoner in this paper, based on the one described in <ref> (Ioerger 1994) </ref>, uses dynamic manipulation of images to handle indeterminacy, essentially generating consistent alternatives as needed. Given an initial set of constraints, a representative image is constructed that best satisfies the constraints, effectively extending an incomplete description into a concrete instantiation.

Reference-contexts: A second class of hybrid reason-ers includes those that take a model-based approach, in which a set of facts about a specific situation is incrementally built-up and used to check the consistency of other sentences during theorem-proving. Constraint-logic programming <ref> (Jaffar & Lassez 1987) </ref> is a well-known example of this approach. Myers and Kono-lige's (1995) hybrid system, with its accumulation of facts about an image via the reflection process, instantiates this model-based approach for spatial reasoning. In contrast, our hybrid reasoning method is more like an intelligent case-based analysis.

Reference-contexts: However, we would like to retain the use of the spatial reasoning system, since it saves us the effort of writing down a whole set of axioms about spatial relationships. Also, spatial reasoners are often more efficient than generic theorem-proving methods for solving spatial problems <ref> (Lindsay 1988) </ref>. So we would like to treat them as specialized problem-solvers and take advantage of them at appropriate times within a larger reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: While this requirement facilitates concrete reasoning with images, and is easily satisfied in many domains, there may be applications where solving hybrid-spatial problems involves uncertainty about the existence of objects themselves in the image. In such cases, a more flexible approach to domain enumeration, such as in <ref> (Myers & Konolige 1995) </ref> may be needed. A second limitation is that domain enumeration can potentially cause a great increase in the number of clauses.

Reference-contexts: One class of hybrid reasoners treats the problem-solver as a kind of specialized inference step that can be used to combine sentences that would not otherwise be allowed. An example of this approach is theory resolution <ref> (Stickel 1985) </ref>, which extends unification in domain-specific ways. Sorted logics (Walther 1988) and terminological reasoners (Brach-man, Gilbert, & Levesque 1985) can also be looked at in this perspective, since they allow certain new inferences based on external information, such as about types.
