Title: A Uniform Framework For Integrating Knowledge In Heterogeneous Knowledge Systems  
Author: Sibel Adal Ross Emery 
Keyword: Incomplete Imprecise or Uncertain Information, Heterogeneous Systems and Interoperability

Abstract: Integrating knowledge from multiple sources is an important aspect of automated reasoning systems. Wiederhold and his colleagues [5, 6] have proposed the concept of a mediator a device that will express how such an integration is to be achieved. In [1, 2, 11], Subrahmanian et al. presented a uniform declarative and operational framework for mediators for amalgamating multiple knowledge bases and data structures (e.g. relational, object-oriented, spatial, and temporal structures) when these knowledge bases (possibly) contain inconsistencies, uncertainties, and non-monotonic modes of negation. In this paper, we specify the programming environment for this framework and show that it can be used to extract and integrate information obtained from different sources of data and resolve conflicts. We will also show that it can be extended easily to integrate new knowledge bases.

However, the theory developed in <ref> [8] </ref> to integrate information from arbitrary knowledge bases does not specify how extensibility is achieved. In this paper, we develop a new syntax for the general case. The tasks performed by the mediator developer can be divided into two mutually exclusive subtasks. <p> It was shown in <ref> [8, 11] </ref> that the mediatory knowledge base framework can be easily extended to any complete truth value lattice. 2.1.2 Integration of Multiple Knowledge Bases Since the mediatory language is an extension of the GAP framework, it consists of prolog-like clauses with only one atom in the head.

Annotated logic is an extension of logic programming where atoms are marked explicitly with values which may be viewed as confidence factors, degrees of belief or truth values. We will refer to these values as simply truth values.
