Abstract: The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is recommended as a candidate for many hard real-time local-area communication systems. The Timed-Token Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol of FDDI is capable of guaranteeing real-time traffic on the FDDI network with the synchronous transmission mode. This report addresses the issues in implementing real-time communications on an FDDI network using synchronous mode transmission, and guaranteeing the application-to-application deadlines of multiple message streams. Extensive research has been done on using FDDI for real-time communication. Most previous research was based on a simplified model and had two main limitations: (1) delays and deadlines were only considered at the MAC level; and (2) in order to simplify the analysis, only one message stream per node was allowed. These limitations restrict the applicability of the past research to practical FDDI-based communication systems, since in these systems, multiple communication applications may have to run on the same node to send out messages, and the processing delays of higher layers than MAC layer may have great impact on the total delay. Our work removes these limitations and shows a systematic way for managing end-to-end message delays at the application level on an FDDI network. We consider the integrated system which include host subsystems (sender and receiver hosts) and the network. A synchronous server is proposed to eliminate the restriction of one message stream per node. The subsequent problems, faced in bandwidth allocation and network access when multiple streams are allowed on one node, are addressed. The design and implementation of the synchronous server are discussed, and a methodology is proposed for estimating end-to-end message delays and guaranteeing deadlines when using such a server. Experimental results are provided to support our claims.

Reference-contexts: There has been extensive research on using FDDI networks for real-time communication. Johnson and Sevcik [9, 15] proved that when the network operates normally, the time elapsed between two consecutive visits of the token at a node is bounded by 2 T T RT . In <ref> [1] </ref>, this result was generalized to state that the time elapsed between any m consecutive visits is bounded by m T T RT , and it is also proved that the worst case achievable utilization is 33% using the Normalized Proportional Allocation scheme. <p> All of these conditions can be summarized in the following constraints. We now extend the theory established in <ref> [1, 13, 10] </ref>. The previous work was limited to single message streams per node, and consider only MAC-to-MAC delays. These limitations are removed here. The previous work is extended to the case where multiple message streams may be present on a node.

Reference-contexts: So we have to activate it before it can be used. In order to do this, the source code for the FDDI device driver for the Solaris 2.x platform, and that for SMT ver. 6.2 was previously modified to support synchronous mode tranmission. See <ref> [12] </ref> for implementation details. <p> This is shown in Figure 3. The NIF board contains a 256KB buffer memory which consists of one synchronous queue (SYNC), three asynchronous queues (ASYNC0, ASYNC1 and ASYNC2), one receive queue, and a special frames area. <ref> [12] </ref> gives some details. In SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x), most device drivers are implemented using the STREAMS mechanism.
