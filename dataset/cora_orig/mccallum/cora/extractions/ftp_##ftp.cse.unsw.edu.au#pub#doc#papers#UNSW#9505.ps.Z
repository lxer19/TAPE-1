Reference-contexts: This design has demonstrated an independently-confirmed efficiency of 24.0 % <ref> [1] </ref>, the highest ever recorded for a silicon solar cell under unconcentrated terrestrial illu mination (so-called air mass 1.5 global, AM1.5G, spectrum, normalized to P l = 100 mW=cm 2 ). <p> This constitutes a convincing success-story for simulation, as finding the right balance between shading and resistive losses would otherwise have required a tedious, expensive and time-consuming series of experiments. This reduction contributed significantly to the latest world record for 1-sun silicon solar cell efficiency <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 14 shows the improved voltage profile of cell zt11E, produced in the same batch as the record cells.

Reference-contexts: These 3D effects are rather mild, and not relevant in most cases: an optimisation study of the rear contact spacing [16], which was based on 2D simulation, produced similar results of the optimal spacing as subsequent 3D studies <ref> [9, 17] </ref>. However, for the determination and characterisation of R s , the resistive effect of the crowding of the hole current around the rear contacts needs to be accurately modelled.

Reference-contexts: V oc is strongly degraded by electron-hole pairs lost to recombination. The fill factor is only slightly influenced by recombination, but is very sensitive to resistive losses, which reduce V mpp . For more details on solar cell operation, see <ref> [11, 12] </ref>. 2 Note that, in general, logarithmic plots of diode characteristics are more infor- mative than linear ones, as the former are straight lines for ideal diodes.

Reference-contexts: The J-V curve of a solar cell under illumination can be similarly represented if it is first shifted into the first quadrant by adding J sc <ref> [13] </ref> (which, for all practical purposes, is the same as J l ). 1 All illuminated J-V curves shown in the remainder of this paper are shifted by J sc . 2.2 Characteristics of high-efficiency silicon solar cells A typical representative of high-efficiency silicon solar cells is the passivated emit ter, <p> However, even such an open perimeter degrades cell performance. Carriers diffuse across the boundary of the illuminated cell area where they are eventually lost by recombination. Estimates based on simple analytical models predict a degradation of V oc of about 6 mV in 2fi2 cm 2 cells <ref> [13] </ref>. The active perimeter region is quite large. <p> For the device simulations we used mostly measured parameters <ref> [13, 16] </ref>. The bulk lifetimes cannot be measured experimentally in a manufactured cell. We therefore used them as a fitting parameter to match the experimentally observed V oc value. The resulting curve fit is shown in Furthermore, the finger and busbar resistivities can only be measured with significant inaccuracy.

Reference-contexts: Internal reflection at the front and rear surfaces are treated by wavelength-independent reflectivities, and light remaining after two full passes through the cell is assumed to be absorbed homogeneously throughout the cell, as in <ref> [14] </ref>. We then adjust the intensity of the incoming light to fit the measured J sc value. This approach will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication [15].

While, with these simplifications, the emitter region of a PERL cell is 2D, the rear contact pattern, and hence the current distribution in the base, is truly 3D.

However, for the determination and characterisation of R s , the resistive effect of the crowding of the hole current around the rear contacts needs to be accurately modelled. <p> The measured J-V characteristics were corrected by the measured (total) resistance, while the simulated characteristics were corrected by the simulated (internal) resistance. Although this procedure has been used successfully in the analysis of the non-ideal J-V characteristics of PERL cells <ref> [16] </ref>, it is not appropriate for R s optimisation studies. The main reason for this is that the so-called non-generation loss, which contributes to R s , cannot be determined without knowledge of the actual voltage profile along the front metal grid of a cell. <p> For the device simulations we used mostly measured parameters <ref> [13, 16] </ref>. The bulk lifetimes cannot be measured experimentally in a manufactured cell. We therefore used them as a fitting parameter to match the experimentally observed V oc value.

Reference-contexts: At the rear surface a 10 nm spacing of mesh lines is required to resolve an inversion layer resulting from oxide charges and the Si-Al work function difference <ref> [18] </ref>. The mesh shown consists of approximately 60,000 vertices. 3D domains much larger than the standard domain are obviously unfeasible.

Reference-contexts: One of the curves is shifted, by J sc = J (a) (0) J (b) (0), so that the short-circuit currents agree. The series resistance is then given as <ref> [20] </ref>: R s (V ) = J sc where V is the distance between the curves in V direction at voltage V . All device and circuit simulations were performed using the mixed-mode de vice and circuit simulator DESSIS [21]. <p> Figure 14 shows the improved voltage profile of cell zt11E, produced in the same batch as the record cells. The simulations show that for these later cells the grid is very close to optimal <ref> [20] </ref>. 5 Conclusions We have presented numerical simulations of a large, 2fi2 cm 2 device with submi-cron feature sizes.
