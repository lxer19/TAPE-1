Reference-contexts: The cycle amplitude f ( t ) of the standard waveform, expressed as a measure of the antenna current, conforms to the equation <ref> [CG81] </ref> f ( t ) = A ( t - t ) 2 exp -2 ( t - t) where A is a normalizing constant, t is the time in m s, t is the envelope-to-cycle difference (ECD) in m s and PC is the phase code parameter in radians.

Reference-contexts: LORAN-C System Operation The LORAN-C Timing Receiver is designed to operate using transmissions of the LORAN-C radionavigation system operated by the U.S. Coast Guard <ref> [FRA83] </ref>. All LORAN-C stations transmit using a biphase-modulated, pulsed carrier at a radio frequency of 100 kHz. The signal consists of a group of eight or nine pulses transmitted at intervals of 1 ms. <p> Thus, for an error rate of 10 -3 or better, the SNR at the receiver demodulator should be -8.3 dB or greater, which is similar to figures quoted for other receivers <ref> [FRA83] </ref>. In practice the noise is much more likely to be atmospheric noise bursts or cross-rate interference, which has a character distinctly non-Gaussian; however, this model is useful in comparing performance between different designs. <p> The conventional approach to this problem is to develop a synthetic signal constructed as the sum of the envelope amplitude less some fraction of its first derivative. Properly constructed, this synthetic signal, called the derived envelope <ref> [FRA83] </ref>, has a positive-going zero crossing at the third carrier cycle. The 21 control program can then selectively extract the phase signal at the first zero crossing following that as the control signal for the PLL. Attempts to utilize this approach in the LORAN-C Timing Receiver have not been encouraging.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the prototype receiver does not have the software necessary to align the 1 pulse-per-second output precisely to UTC time. It is intended that this capability be provided using the Network Time Protocol and other time servers on the Internet <ref> [MIL90] </ref>. Also, since the control program is not interrupt driven and monopolizes the resources of the machine in which it runs.

Reference-contexts: The primary objective was to supplant and eventually replace a cesium clock and LORAN-C timing receiver on loan from the U.S. Coast Guard. The ultimate goal was to produce an easily duplicatable, low cost primary clock suitable for computer networks using the Network Time Protocol <ref> [MIL91] </ref>. A prototype timing receiver has been completed, tested and evaluated. The results of this project, including the hardware and software design and test results, are summarized in this report. <p> However, in the intended application the controlling computer is connected to a network supporting the Network Time Protocol (NTP) <ref> [MIL91] </ref>, which ordinarily provides timing from redundant sources to an accuracy of a few milliseconds. Thus, NTP can be used to resolve the interval ambiguity.

Reference-contexts: SmallSignal Analysis In this application the PLL is designed as a type-I, second-order system, which is characterized by the (closed loop) transfer function <ref> [SMI86] </ref> q o = s 2 2 z + 1 -1 where q o is the output phase from the VCO, q r is the reference phase from the LORAN-C signal and w n and z are related to the loop gain K v and loop-filter corner frequency w L :
