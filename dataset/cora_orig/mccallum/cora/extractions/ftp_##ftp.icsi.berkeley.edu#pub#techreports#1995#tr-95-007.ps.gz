Abstract: ATM networks will carry a wide variety of data over the same packet switching network. A majority of this traffic is expected to be real-time video generated by video on demand, video conferencing systems, etc. We study the characteristics of video data compressed using standard coding algorithms namely, JPEG, MPEG and also popular ones such as the video conferencing software NV. A wide range of video sources from movies to a class lecture were analyzed. Most of the traces were longer than an hour. The bit rate of the traces has been characterized using the leaky bucket model. We also show a method of choosing appropriate leaky bucket parameters. Burstiness function is used to characterize the burstiness of the video traffic at different time scales. Our studies indicate that JPEG compressed has very little short term burstiness. MPEG and NV traffic shows high burstiness over small time scales. JPEG and MPEG video exhibit burstiness over long time scales, whereas NV shows no burstiness over long time scales. It is found that for constant quality JPEG and MPEG compressed video, the leaky bucket parameters depend upon the contents of the video. For JPEG video, the service rate is mainly determined by the peak rate and for MPEG the service rate is given by the peak rate of the smoothed MPEG stream. However, the traffic generated by NV can be characterized independent of the actual video. The target sending rate of the software NV determines the service rate for its traffic.

Reference-contexts: The video consists of a series of independently compressed JPEG pictures which makes the algorithm an intra-frame compression algorithm. MPEG is a compression standard designed for storage and transmission of video [10] <ref> [1] </ref>. It is an inter-frame coding algorithm which exploits spatial and temporal redundancy of the video to achieve the compression. It also uses a DCT based coding as in JPEG algorithm. The frames are classified into 3 types - I-frames, P-frames and B-frames.

Reference-contexts: The real-time traffic would need some kind of quality of service (QOS) guarantees from the network. Call admission control enables the network to provide the QOS guarantees. Various types of scheduling disciplines, QOS parameters and associated admission control methods have been proposed in [6], [21], [13], [12], [5] and <ref> [3] </ref>. Most of these schemes need a traffic descriptor (like peak bit rate, mean bit rate etc.) which characterizes the traffic. These descriptors are used in the connection setup phase to determine whether the network has enough resources to satisfy the QOS requirements of the traffic.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth and buffer assignment for leaky bucket model has been studied in great detail. Therefore leaky bucket is an appropriate descriptor to characterize the traffic. We characterize burstiness of the traffic at various time scale using the burstiness function as defined by Cruz <ref> [4] </ref>. The traces used for this paper are from a variety of sequences and encoding algorithms. The sequences were choosen to represent a range of sequences present in real life (Broadcast TV, Class Lecture, full length movie). <p> In the extreme case when the output of the regulator is a smooth traffic having very small bucket size, the maximum smoothing delays incurred by the traffic would be 1 and the buffer space required to do this smoothing would be 1 . Cruz in <ref> [4] </ref> has presented a generalized model to characterize the burstiness of the traffic by bounding its worst case behavior. The burstiness function of a traffic stream is defined as : b (I) = Maximum amount of data sent in any interval of length I.

Reference-contexts: B frames which are smallest in size carry changes in the current frame with respect to last or future I-frame or P-frame.

The NV software tries to limit the bit rate while sending video. This bound or target sending rate can be selected by the user and is generally set to 128 K-bits per second for sending data over the Internet.

Reference-contexts: It could be hard to deal with the congestion as all the clients can potentially send their data at peak rate. Multiplexing behaviour of constant quality video needs to be studied in more detail. Adapting the sending rate depending upon feedback from the network has also been proposed <ref> [14] </ref>. Network signals congestion to the application and based on this congestion signal the application sending video adapts to a different rate by having a different compression ratio.
