Abstract: We address the following question: how do we know a proposed design for an Automated Vehicle/Highway System (AVHS), such as [4], is safe? In particular, can we prove that there can be no high relative velocity collision on the AVHS? We show that if the controllers in the vehicles satisfy a set of constraints, then the AVHS of [4] is safe. The problem of checking whether the controllers satisfy the constraints is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Automation of driving functions is central to proposals for the design of an Automated Vehicle/Highway System (AVHS). In the control architecture in <ref> [4] </ref>, it is proposed that vehicles travel in platoons. Three maneuvers are needed: in merge, two platoons join together; in split, one platoon separates into two; and in change lane, a single vehicle changes lane. <p> Control laws for the merge and split maneuver are proposed in [1]. A design for the coordination layer is proposed in [3]. This consists of protocols modeled with finite state machines. In this paper we consider the following problem. Consider an AVHS, for example the system proposed in <ref> [4, 2, 1, 3] </ref>. How do we know that such a system is safe? Of course we have to define what safety means. We say a system is unsafe if there is a possibility of a high relative velocity collision on the AVHS. <p> We consider a proposed design for an AVHS and show that if the physical controllers in the vehicles satisfy a set of constraints then the AVHS is safe. In Section 2, we describe relevant part of the AVHS design proposed by <ref> [4, 2, 1, 3] </ref>. In Section 3, we show that a single lane AVHS is safe when the controllers satisfy a set of constraints. In Section 4, we extend the design to include the change lane maneuver, and prove that the new design is also safe.
