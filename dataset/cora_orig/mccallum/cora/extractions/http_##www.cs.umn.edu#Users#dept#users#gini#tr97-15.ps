Abstract: We present a generalized market architecture that provides support for a variety of types of transactions, from simple buying and selling of goods and services to complex multi-agent contract negotiations. This architecture is organized around three basic components: the exchange, the market, and the session. We also present a negotiation protocol for planning by contracting that takes advantage of the services of the market. We show how the existence of an appropriate market infrastructure can add value to a multi-agent contracting protocol by controlling fraud and discouraging counterspeculation.

Reference-contexts: A Market Architecture for Multi-Agent Contracting April 18, 1997 3 Support for complex multi-agent negotiation Protocols that require agents to do complex marginal cost computations [15, 16], or plan generation and composition <ref> [1, 12] </ref>, may require extended periods of time to complete, during which a context must be maintained. The time during which the negotiated transaction extends can also span significant periods of time, at least in the range of weeks to months. <p> We are concerned with two general types of counterspeculation. Value-based counterspeculation [12, 15, 20] occurs when agents use their own estimates of each others valuations to set bid prices. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we identified two classes of time-based counterspeculation opportunities in a contracting domain that can be controlled by the settings of certain timing parameters. <p> The system should also have the ability to control the timing of negotiation events, such as ensuring that customers do not see bids until after the bid deadline has passed, in order to discourage suppliers from speculating about the customers processing capabilities <ref> [1] </ref>.

This eliminates the possi bility of temporal counterspeculation as identified in <ref> [1] </ref>. If the customer desires or the market requires, the session can act as a trusted auctioneer in a Vickrey auction. 3.3 Example We conclude this discussion with an example. A startup company, Acme Software and Screen Doors, Inc., is releasing version 1.0 of its new killer application.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of these rules is to allow the agents to make constructive agreements. Their analysis assumes that the negotiating agents have similar capabilities. The protocol we present in this paper does not require that assumption. Mechanisms to reduce counterspeculation, such as the Clarke tax mechanism <ref> [2] </ref> or the Vickrey auction [19] have been proposed for automated negotiation of self-interested agents.

Reference-contexts: In a commodity-oriented domain, it would include terms for the products or services within the domain, as well as terminology for quality, quantity, features, terms and conditions of business, etc. In a planning-oriented domain, specifications of services would be in a form that supports planning, such as Strips-type operators <ref> [3] </ref>.
