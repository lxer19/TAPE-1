Abstract: Packing for Layout Reuse Technical Report : UCSC-CRL-97-23 Abstract As the increasing complexity of IC design, layout reuse becomes more important. The design for renewed fabrication processes usually maintains the layout technology but using different design rules. First we extract devices and group them as a set of macro device blocks. After shrinking the macro device blocks, we would like to pack the rectilinear shaped blocks together while maintaining the original topological relationship. Such problem is referred to as topology constrained rectilinear block packing problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient data representation for a special class of rectilinear polygons, called ordered convex rectilinear polygons, using Bounded Slicing Grid (BSG) structure. Based on both Sequence Pair (SP) and BSG structure, we propose an algorithm, which independently compacts x and y dimension under the topology constraints given the blocks are ordered convex shapes. By augument-ing or further partitioning the arbitrary rectilinear polygons into the ordered convex shapes, this method can be extended to handle the general rectilinear shaped blocks.

Intuitively L-shaped polygon was sliced into two sub-rectangles and assigned into adjacent BSG rooms. After the BSG packing, the coordinates of the sub-rectangles are aligned to recover the L-shape as shown in Fig. 7. <p> In addition, we ignore the dummy blocks or empty groups attached at the end of the sequences. The grouped SP is as follows : 20 (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; [0] [1] [8 4] [7] [ ] [5] [ ] [3] [6 2] <ref> [9] </ref>): Blocks a 1 , a 2 , a 8 and a 9 are q-marked, in which the first condition of Lemma 4 has already been satisfied for blocks a 1 and a 9 , so the pq-adjustment is carried out only for a 2 and a 8 : (1 fl

Rather than enumerating all possible relations as done by <ref> [10] </ref>, we can simply but accurately describe such relation using the binary relations of the corresponding sub-rectangles.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, given a BSG assignment as shown in Fig. 4 (d), the optimal compaction can be achieved by independently compacting x and y dimension as shown in Fig. 4 (e). It has been proved by <ref> [11] </ref> that there exists an assignment of n rectangular blocks in BSG domain of n rows by n columns, such that the corresponding packing is optimal. 2.2 Sequence Pair (SP) A sequence pair for a set of n blocks is a pair of sequences of n symbols which represent blocks.
