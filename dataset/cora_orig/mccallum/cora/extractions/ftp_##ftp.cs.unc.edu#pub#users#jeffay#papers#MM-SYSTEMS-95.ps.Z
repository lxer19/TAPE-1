Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of several policies for managing the effect of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for which the other policies exhibit poor performance.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach used in computer-based conferencing systems based on networks that provide isochronous services (such as ATM). Another approach is to minimize delay jitter by reserving resources in the network so as to provide guaranteed bounds on delay and delay jitter. For example, Ferrari <ref> [1] </ref> presents a scheme in which clients requiring real-time communication services specify their traffic characteristics and performance requirements. In response, the system reserves sufficient resources at each node on the network (e.g., processor capacity, buffer space) to guarantee the performance requirements of the client.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear however that our primary goal should be playout with no gaps. Display latency is only one important factor in determining the perceived quality of the playout <ref> [2] </ref>. It is likely that in many conferencing applications, as long as gaps occur infrequently, playout with low latency and some gaps will be preferable to playout with high latency and no gaps.

Reference-contexts: Two policies, the I-policy and the E-policy, are taken from the literature; the third, queue monitoring, is a new policy that we have developed. The performance of these policies is evaluated with an empirical study based on an experimental computer-based video conferencing system (described in <ref> [3] </ref>). In the study, traces of the end-to-end delays experienced by frames are recorded during the execution of the conferencing system under a variety of (real) network loads.

Reference-contexts: Fourth, the emphasis in this work has been on managing delay jitter. Another aspect of our work is a forward error correction (FEC) strategy for minimizing frame loss <ref> [4] </ref>. By decreasing loss, FEC will support the assumptions underlying queue monitoring, namely that display queue length only decreases as a result of late arrivals. However, frames that are recovered through FEC will incur longer end-to-end delays, thus increasing delay jitter.

Reference-contexts: A policy for decreasing display latency based on observing queue lengths has been used to govern the behavior of the audio display queue in the Pandora system <ref> [5] </ref>. Whenever frames are added to the display queue (called the clawback buffer), the length of the queue is checked against a target value. In the Pandora system, the target is 2 frames (which corresponds to 4 ms. of audio data). <p> Among the possibilities are the geometric decrease in threshold values we used in this study, and a linear decrease in threshold values suggested by Jones and Hopper <ref> [5] </ref>. 20

Reference-contexts: There are two choices: either the frame can be discarded or it can be displayed. These choices define two delay jitter management policies which Naylor and Kleinrock call the I-Policy and the E-Policy <ref> [6] </ref>. Under the I-policy, frames are displayed with a single fixed display latency which is a parameter of the policy, and each frame that arrives with an end-to-end delay greater than this latency is discarded. Under the E-policy, late frames are displayed at the next opportunity.

Reference-contexts: For their particular model of audio quality, they stated a rule of thumb for choosing m and k (m &gt; 40 and k = .07*m) which usually resulted in good quality audio. More recent work on practical solutions for the Internet (as exemplified by Nevot <ref> [7] </ref>), has also used a scheme by which a display latency is chosen at the beginning of each talkspurt on the basis of observed delay jitter.
