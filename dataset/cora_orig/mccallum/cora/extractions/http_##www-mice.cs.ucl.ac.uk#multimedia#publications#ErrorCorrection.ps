Abstract: We survey a number of packet-loss recovery techniques for streaming audio applications operating using IP multicast. We begin with a discussion of the loss and delay characteristics of an IP multicast channel and from this show the need for packet loss recovery. Recovery techniques may be divided into two classes: sender-and receiver-based. We compare and contrast several sender-based recovery schemes: forward error correction (both media specific and media independent) interleaving and retransmission. In addition a number of error concealment schemes are discussed. We conclude with a series of recommendations for repair schemes to be used, based on application requirements and network conditions.

Reference-contexts: The transmitted codeword is determined by evaluating the polynomial for all non-zero values of x over the number base. Whilst this may sound complicated, the encoding procedure is relatively straightforward and optimised decoding procedures such as the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [1, 21] </ref> are available. In the absence of packet losses decoding carries the same computational cost as encoding, but when losses occur it is significantly more expensive. There are several advantages to forward error correction schemes.

Reference-contexts: This problem is more acute for interactive applications: if interactivity is unimportant a large playout delay may be inserted to allow for these delayed packets. This problem and algorithms for playout buffer adaption are studied further in <ref> [2, 25, 32] </ref>. Unlike other communications media, IP multicast allows for the trade-off between quality and interactivity to be made independently for each receiver in a session, since this is a local choice only and is not communicated to the source of the data.

Reference-contexts: Although some parts of the Mbone operate over dedicated links, the distinguishing feature is the presence of multicast routing support: multicast traffic typically shares links with other traffic. A number of attempts have been made to characterise the loss patterns seen on the Mbone <ref> [3, 4, 14, 47] </ref>. Although these results vary somewhat, the broad conclusion is clear: in a large conference it is inevitable that some receivers will experience packet loss. <p> If a packet is lost then another packet containing the same unit will be able to cover the loss. The principle is illustrated in figure 5. This approach has been advocated by Hardman et al. [15] and Bolot et al. <ref> [3] </ref> for use on the Mbone and extensively simulated by Podolsky et al. [31]. The first transmitted copy of the audio data is referred to as the primary encoding and subsequent transmissions as secondary encodings. <p> The advantage of this scheme is that is uses compu-tationally cheap measures and can be coded compactly. However, it can only cover short periods of loss due to the crude nature of the measures. Hardman et al. [15] and Bolot et al. <ref> [3] </ref> advocate the use of low bit-rate analysis-by-synthesis codecs, such as LPC (2.4-5.6kbps) and GSM (13.2kbps), which although computationally more demanding can tolerably cover the loss periods experienced on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The major advantage of interleaving is that it does not increase the bandwidth requirements of a stream. 3.3 Retransmission Interactive audio applications have tight latency bounds and end-to-end delays need to be less than 250ms <ref> [5] </ref>. For this reason such applications do not typically employ retransmission based recovery for lost packets. If larger end-to-end delays can be tolerated the use of retransmission to recover from loss becomes a possibility.

Reference-contexts: A number of surveys have previously been published in the area of reliable multicast and IP-based audio/video transport. The work by Obraczka [28] and Levine and Garcia-Luna-Aceves [20] is limited to the study of fully-reliable transport and does not consider real-time delivery. The survey by Carle and Biersack <ref> [6] </ref> discusses real-time IP-based audio/video applications and techniques for error recovery in this environment. However, that work neglects receiver-based error concealment techniques and focuses on sender-driven mechanisms for error correction. Sender-driven and receiver-based repair are complementary techniques, and applications should use both methods to achieve the best possible performance.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to previous work, we limit the focus of our paper to streaming audio applications and discuss both sender driven repair and receiver-based error concealment techniques. 2 Multicast Channel Characteristics The concept of IP multicast was proposed by Deering <ref> [8] </ref> to provide a scalable and efficient means by which datagrams may be distributed to a group of receivers.

Reference-contexts: Erdol et al. <ref> [9] </ref> consider using short term energy and zero crossing measurements as their secondary scheme. When loss occurs the receiver then interpolates an audio signal about the crossings using the short-term energy measurements. The advantage of this scheme is that is uses compu-tationally cheap measures and can be coded compactly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The development of IP multicast and the Internet multicast backbone has led to be emergence of a new class of scalable audio/video conferencing applications. These are based on the lightweight sessions model <ref> [11, 17] </ref> and provide efficient multi-way communication which scales from two to several thousand participants. The network model underlying these applications differs significantly from the tightly coupled approach in use for traditional conferencing systems. <p> If larger end-to-end delays can be tolerated the use of retransmission to recover from loss becomes a possibility. A widely deployed reliable multicast scheme based on the retransmission of lost packets is Scalable Reliable Multicast <ref> [11] </ref>. When a member of an SRM session detects loss, it will wait a random amount of time, determined by its distance from the original source of the lost data and then multicast a repair request.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of interpolation based schemes over insertion based techniques is that they account for the changing characteristics of a signal. 4.2.1 Waveform Substitution Waveform substitution uses audio before, and optionally after, the loss to find a suitable signal to cover the loss. Goodman et al. <ref> [12] </ref> studied the use of waveform substitution in packet voice systems. They examined both one- and two-sided techniques that use templates to locate suitable pitch patterns either side of the loss. In the one sided scheme the pattern is repeated across the gap but with the two-sided schemes interpolation occurs.

Reference-contexts: This technique has been evaluated by Gruber and Strawczynski <ref> [13] </ref> and shown to perform poorly. Low loss rates and short clipping lengths (4-16ms) faired best, but the results were intolerable for losses above 3%.

This is most clearly illustrated by the work of Handley <ref> [14] </ref> which tracks RTP reception report statistics for a large multicast session over several days. A typical portion of this trace is illustrated in figure 1. It can be seen that most receivers experience loss in the range of 2-5%, with some smaller number seeing significantly higher loss rates. <p> The overwhelming cause of loss is due to congestion at routers. It is therefore not surprising that there is a correlation between the bandwidth used and the amount of loss experienced <ref> [14, 16] </ref> and the underlying loss rate varies during the day. A multicast channel will typically have relatively high latency and the variation in end-to-end delay may be large. <p> As loss rates increase, the overhead due to retransmission request packets increases. Eventually a cross-over point is reached, beyond which the use of FEC becomes more effective. It has been observed in large Mbone sessions that most packets are lost by at least one receiver <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is only effective with short packet lengths (. 4ms) and low loss rates (. 2%) <ref> [18] </ref>, making it suitable for interleaved audio over low loss paths. The performance of silence substitution degrades rapidly as packet sizes increase and quality is unacceptably bad for the 40ms packet size in common use in network audio conferencing tools.

Reference-contexts: This makes it suitable for interactive applications, where large end-to-end delays cannot be tolerated.

At the time of writing, media specific FEC is supported by a number of Mbone audio conferencing tools.

A large number of reliable multicast protocols have been defined (see <ref> [20] </ref> for a survey) which are similarly unsuitable for streaming media and hence are not studied here. For similar reasons, TCP is not appropriate for unicast streaming audio. That is not to say that retransmission based schemes cannot be used for streaming media, in some circumstances.

Reference-contexts: This is illustrated in figure 4.

Reed-Solomon codes <ref> [22, 34] </ref> are renowned for their excellent error correcting properties. Encoding is based upon the properties of polynomials over particular number bases. Essentially RS encoders take a set of codewords and use these as coefficients of a polynomial, f (x).

Reference-contexts: At the time of writing, there is no standard solution to this problem. There have been a number of contributions which show the likely form the solution will take <ref> [23, 35, 42] </ref>. These typically use some form of layered encoding of data sent at different rates over multiple multicast groups, with receivers joining and leaving groups in response to long-term congestion and with FEC being employed to overcome short-term transient congestion.

Reference-contexts: Loss of a single packet will therefore have a large effect on the intelligibility of speech. If the loss is spread out so that small parts of several phonemes are lost, it becomes easier for people to mentally patch-over this loss <ref> [24] </ref> resulting in improved perceived quality for a given loss rate. In a somewhat similar manner, error concealment techniques perform significantly better with small gaps, since the amount of change in the signal's characteristics is likely to be smaller. <p> In addition, when compared to silence, the use of white noise has been shown to give both subjectively better quality <ref> [24] </ref> and improved intelligibility [44]. It is, therefore, recommended as a replacement for silence substitution. As an extension for this, a proposed future revision of the RTP profile for audio/video conferences [39] allows for the transmission of comfort noise indicator packets.

Reference-contexts: The use of media specific FEC incurs an overhead in terms of packet size. For example the use of 8kHz PCM -law (64kbps) as the primary compression scheme and GSM <ref> [26] </ref> (13kbps) as the secondary results in a 20% increase in the size of the data portion of each packet. Like media independent FEC schemes, the overhead of media specific FEC is variable.

Reference-contexts: In cases such as this, it is clear that the use of retransmission is probably only appropriate as a secondary technique to repair losses which are not repaired by FEC. An alternative combination of FEC and retransmission has been studied by Nonnenmacher et al. <ref> [27] </ref>. This work takes the approach of using parity FEC packets to repair multiple losses with a single retransmission, achieving substantial bandwidth savings relative to pure retransmission.

Reference-contexts: It should be considered for all streaming media. 3.2 Interleaving When the unit size is smaller than the packet size and end-to-end delay is unimportant, interleaving is a useful technique for reducing the effects of loss <ref> [33] </ref>. Units are resequenced before transmission, so that originally adjacent units are separated by a guaranteed distance in the transmitted stream and returned to their original order at the receiver. Interleaving disperses the effect of packet losses.

In parity coding, the exclusive-or (XOR) operation is applied across groups of packets to generate corresponding parity packets. An example of this has been implemented by Rosenberg <ref> [36] </ref>. In this scheme, 1 parity packet is transmitted after every n 1 data packets. Provided there is just one loss in every n packets, then that loss is recoverable. This is illustrated in figure 4.

Reference-contexts: A large number of block coding schemes exists and we discuss only two cases, parity coding and Reed-Solomon coding, as these are currently proposed as an RTP payload <ref> [37] </ref>. These block coding schemes were originally designed for the detection and correction of errors within a stream of transmitted bits and so the check bits were generated from a stream of data bits. <p> This is illustrated in figure 4. Many different parity codes may be derived by XOR'ing different combinations of packets, a number of these were proposed by Budge et al. and summarised by Rosenberg & Schulzrinne <ref> [37] </ref>. Reed-Solomon codes [22, 34] are renowned for their excellent error correcting properties. Encoding is based upon the properties of polynomials over particular number bases. Essentially RS encoders take a set of codewords and use these as coefficients of a polynomial, f (x).

Reference-contexts: The technique, known as pitch waveform replication, was found to work marginally better than waveform substitution. 4.2.3 Time Scale Modification Time scale modification allows the audio either side of the loss to be stretched across the loss. Sanneck et al. <ref> [38] </ref> present a scheme that finds overlapping vectors of pitch cycles either side of the loss, offsets them to cover the loss and averages them where they overlap.

Reference-contexts: It is, therefore, recommended as a replacement for silence substitution. As an extension for this, a proposed future revision of the RTP profile for audio/video conferences <ref> [39] </ref> allows for the transmission of comfort noise indicator packets. This allows the communication of the loudness level of the background noise to be played, allowing for better fill-in information to be generated. 4.1.4 Repetition Repetition replaces lost units with copies of the unit that arrived immediately before the loss.

Reference-contexts: Internet conferencing applications, based on IP multicast, typically employ an application-level protocol to provide approximate information as to the set of receivers and reception quality statistics. This protocol is the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP <ref> [40] </ref>. The portion of the Internet which supports IP multicast is known as the multicast backbone (Mbone). Although some parts of the Mbone operate over dedicated links, the distinguishing feature is the presence of multicast routing support: multicast traffic typically shares links with other traffic.

Reference-contexts: If the primary encoding consumes considerable processing power, but has sufficient quality and low bandwidth, then the secondary encodings may be the same as the primary. An example of this is the ITU G.723.1 <ref> [41] </ref> codec which consumes a considerable fraction of today's desktop processing power, but has a low bandwidth (5.3/6.3kbps). The use of media specific FEC incurs an overhead in terms of packet size. <p> Typically, they are also somewhat computationally intensive. 4.3.1 Interpolation of Transmitted State For codecs based on transform coding or linear prediction, it is possible that the decoder can interpolate between states. For example, the ITU G.723.1 speech coder <ref> [41] </ref> interpolates the state of the linear predictor coefficients either side of short losses and uses either a periodic excitation the same as the previous frame, or gain matched random number generator, depending on whether the signal was voiced or unvoiced. For longer losses, the reproduced signal is gradually faded.

Reference-contexts: At the time of writing, there is no standard solution to this problem. There have been a number of contributions which show the likely form the solution will take <ref> [23, 35, 42] </ref>. These typically use some form of layered encoding of data sent at different rates over multiple multicast groups, with receivers joining and leaving groups in response to long-term congestion and with FEC being employed to overcome short-term transient congestion.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the overhead, approximate repair is used, which is acceptable for audio applications. It should be noted that it may often not be necessary to transmit media specific FEC for every packet. Speech signals have transient stationary states that can cover 80ms. Viswanathan et al. <ref> [43] </ref> describe LPC codecs where units of speech are only transmitted if the parameters of the codec are deemed to have changed sufficiently and achieve a 30% saving bandwidth for the same quality.

Reference-contexts: A number of studies of the human perception of interrupted speech have been conducted, for example that by Warren <ref> [44] </ref>. These have shown that phonemic restoration, the ability of the human brain to subconsciously repair the missing segment of speech with the correct sound, occurs for speech repair using noise substitution but not for silence substitution. <p> In addition, when compared to silence, the use of white noise has been shown to give both subjectively better quality [24] and improved intelligibility <ref> [44] </ref>. It is, therefore, recommended as a replacement for silence substitution. As an extension for this, a proposed future revision of the RTP profile for audio/video conferences [39] allows for the transmission of comfort noise indicator packets.

Reference-contexts: In the one sided scheme the pattern is repeated across the gap but with the two-sided schemes interpolation occurs. The two-sided schemes generally performed better than one sided schemes and both work better than silence substitution and packet repetition. 9 4.2.2 Pitch Waveform Replication Wasem et al. <ref> [45] </ref> present a refinement on waveform substitution by using a pitch detection algorithm either side of the loss. Losses during unvoiced speech segments are repaired using packet repetition and voiced losses repeat a waveform of appropriate pitch length.

Reference-contexts: Eventually a cross-over point is reached, beyond which the use of FEC becomes more effective. It has been observed in large Mbone sessions that most packets are lost by at least one receiver [14]. Indeed, in their implementation of an SRM-like protocol for streaming audio <ref> [46] </ref>, Xu et al. note that "In the worst case, for every multicast packet, at least one receiver does not receive the packet, which means that every packet needs to be transmitted to the whole group at least twice".

Reference-contexts: Although some parts of the Mbone operate over dedicated links, the distinguishing feature is the presence of multicast routing support: multicast traffic typically shares links with other traffic. A number of attempts have been made to characterise the loss patterns seen on the Mbone <ref> [3, 4, 14, 47] </ref>. Although these results vary somewhat, the broad conclusion is clear: in a large conference it is inevitable that some receivers will experience packet loss.
