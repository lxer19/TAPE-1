Abstract: This paper studies some basic problems in a multiple-object auction model using methodologies from theoretical computer science. We are especially concerned with situations where an adversary bidder knows the bidding algorithms of all the other bidders. In the two-bidder case, we derive an optimal randomized bidding algorithm, by which the disadvantaged bidder can procure at least half of the auction objects despite the adversary's a priori knowledge of his algorithm. In the general k-bidder case, if the number of objects is a multiple of k, an optimal randomized bidding algorithm is found. If the k 1 disadvantaged bidders employ that same algorithm, each of them can obtain at least 1=k of the objects regardless of the bidding algorithm the adversary uses. These two algorithms are based on closed-form solutions to certain multivariate probability distributions. In situations where a closed-form solution cannot be obtained, we study a restricted class of bidding algorithms as an approximation to desired optimal algorithms. 1. Introduction. This paper investigates some basic problems in auction theory.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. This paper investigates some basic problems in auction theory. Broadly speaking, an auction is a market mechanism with explicit or implicit rules for allocating resources and determining prices on the basis of bids from market participants <ref> [4, 11, 13, 19] </ref>. Auctions are frequently used to price various types of assets. For instance, the U.S. Treasury raises funds by auctioning T-bonds and T-notes, while the Department of the Interior sells mineral rights on federally owned properties via auction. <p> Very little work in computer science has been conducted on problems related to auctions. Neither auction mechanisms nor bidding algorithms have been formally studied. Nevertheless, computer scientists have realized the importance of auctions as an efficient method of resource allocation <ref> [4] </ref>. Gagliano et al. applied auction techniques to the allocation of decentralized network resources [10]. Yang et al. proposed an auction-based scheme in which task and resource allocations are determined through negotiations among system entities [20].

Reference-contexts: Our work investigates some basic issues of automated negotiation mechanisms which are emerging in electronic commerce and other applications of software agents for resource allocation. For the purpose of maximizing transaction volume and speed <ref> [6] </ref>, we focus on the simultaneous auction of several objects and propose a multiple-object auction model. This model further differs from the IPV and CV models in two significant aspects. In this model, each bidder faces a binding budget constraint which is identical to all the bidders.
