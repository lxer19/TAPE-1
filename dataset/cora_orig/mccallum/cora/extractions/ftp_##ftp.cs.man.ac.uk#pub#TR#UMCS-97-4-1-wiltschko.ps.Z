Report number UMCS-97-4-1. http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/csonly/cstechrep/title97.html The Navigational System of Birds Abstract The avian navigational system is based on an external reference, giving the home direction as a compass course. When young, inexperienced birds begin to fly, their only available orientation mechanism is a magnetic compass provided by their ability to perceive the geomagnetic field. They navigate by using this compass to record the direction of the outward journey and, by reversing this direction, obtain the home course. At the same time, the magnetic compass provides a directional reference system for learning processes establishing the sun compass and the complex navigational mechanisms of experienced birds: a 'mosaic map' and a navigational 'map'. These 'maps' are formed by combining information on the route travelled with sitespecific information, leading to directionally oriented mental representations of the distribution of landmarks and of environmental gradients, respectively, in the home region of birds. These 'maps' enable birds to derive they homeward course from local sitespecific information; once established, they are preferentially used as they allow correction of errors. Pigeons are famous for their ability to return home after displacement over hundreds of kilometers. The question how they navigate, how they determine their home direction at distant, totally unfamiliar sites has always fascinated man, and so it is not surprising that it has for a long time been a topic of intense scientific research. Today, essential aspects of avian navigation are fairly well understood, even if many questions are still open. In the present paper, we want to describe the avian navigational system as it is indicated by experimental evidence, focusing on the structure of the system and how the relevant information is represented and processed.

Reference-contexts: During their first few months of life, young pigeons show a much greater readiness to undertake extended flights than later in life. These spontaneous trips may be exploratory and thus form the basis for establishing the navigational system <ref> (see also Baker 1982 for discussion) </ref>. The respective learning processes may be similar to those establishing human speech, where young children at a certain age are eager to learn to speak and will pick up any language they hear.

Reference-contexts: This applies, for instance, to inertial navigation, i.e. dead-reckoning based exclusively on internal representations of the route, as suggested by Barlow (1964) and demonstrated for small mammals moving within the limited area of an arena <ref> (Etienne et al. 1985) </ref>. Likewise, a response to clockshifting excludes 'piloting' in the sense of orientation based solely on familiar landmarks, as proposed by Griffin (1955) and recently reconsidered as a strategy at familiar sites (e.g. Papi 1986). The available data clearly argue against such an exclusive use of landmarks.

Reference-contexts: This is demonstrated by a series of experiments with experienced pigeons more than one or two years old at distant sites 120 - 200 km from the loft. The results document a continuous improvement of orientation with increasing familiarity <ref> (Grter and Wiltschko 1990) </ref>. Pigeons familiar with the distant sites from a previous release were much better oriented than birds that had the same flying experience in a different region (Fig. 6). <p> This suggests that knowing the true distribution of navigational factors in the region halfway to the distant release site allowed the birds to extrapolate the local factors at the distant site more accurately than birds that did not have this knowledge <ref> (Grter and Wiltschko 1990) </ref>. Fig. 6: Behavior at sites more than 100 km from the loft of adult pigeons with varying experience in the region of the test site. The continuous improvement of orientation with increasing familiarity indicates that old pigeons continue to incorporate new experiences into their map. <p> The continuous improvement of orientation with increasing familiarity indicates that old pigeons continue to incorporate new experiences into their map. Symbols as in Fig. 3 <ref> (data from Grter and Wiltschko 1990) </ref>. Thus even pigeons several years old extended their 'map' and included new information when they found themselves in a region where they had never been before.

Reference-contexts: Wiltschko 1980 for details). Both mechanisms provide birds with essentially the same type of information. The sun compass, a learned mechanism, is preferentially used as long as the sun is visible, but can be replaced by the magnetic compass without apparent loss under overcast skies <ref> (e.g. Keeton 1969) </ref>. 2. The 'Map and Compass'-Model G. Kramer, a pioneer of orientation research, was the first to realize that birds might base navigation on an external reference provided by a compass.

Reference-contexts: The deviations are indeed typical for each site: At some sites, the deviations are almost all to the right, at others to the left (e.g. Wallraff 1959; Schmidt-Koenig 1963; Keeton 1973, R. Wiltschko 1993). The phenomenon is therefore referred to as 'release site bias' <ref> (Keeton 1973) </ref>. Release site biases are not restricted to pigeons, but are observed in other species of birds as well (Keeton 1973, 1974). This points out that the factors causing these deviations act on the various bird species in a similar way. <p> Wallraff 1959; Schmidt-Koenig 1963; Keeton 1973, R. Wiltschko 1993). The phenomenon is therefore referred to as 'release site bias' (Keeton 1973). Release site biases are not restricted to pigeons, but are observed in other species of birds as well <ref> (Keeton 1973, 1974) </ref>. This points out that the factors causing these deviations act on the various bird species in a similar way. Apparently, at many locations, the navigational factors do not indicate the true home direction, but a direction deviating from it.

Reference-contexts: The model described so far refers to the type of factors and the way they are represented. The specific nature of the factors involved is still largely open. Theoretical considerations (Wallraff 1974) indicate that celestial cues, once favored <ref> (e.g. Matthews 1953) </ref>, are not suitable as components of the navigational 'map', because they would require highly complex compensation mechanisms due to the rotation of the earth and the movements of the earth around the sun.

Reference-contexts: Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1982). Another phenomenon is the pigeons' ability to head immediately, i.e. in less than 20 seconds <ref> (e.g. Pratt and Thouless 1955) </ref> into the direction in which they will finally depart. This means that the navigational process does not require extended searching flights, and thus excludes the possibility that pigeons need to scan local gradients to learn gradient directions.

Reference-contexts: This gives birds direct experience with the true distribution of the navigational factors within a more extended area of their home region, and, as a consequence, leads to generally improved orientation at distant sites <ref> (R. Wiltschko 1991) </ref>. The development of the navigational 'map' must be assumed to be a continuous process that is never completed. The experience during the first months of life seems to set up a general set of rules for the 'grid map', specifying how navigational factors are to be extrapolated. <p> W. Wiltschko et al. 1987) and different behavior of pigeons from different lofts at certain sites (e.g. Walcott and Brown 1989) have been documented. These differences can be attributed to differences in experience and thus may reflect differences in the way the 'map' developed <ref> (see W. Wiltschko et al. 1991 for a detailed discussion) </ref>. In all navigational mechanisms, compass orientation plays a fundamental role, as the 'maps' are directionally oriented representations of the environment, indicating directions as compass courses. Compass orientation thus forms the backbone of the birds' representation of space.

Reference-contexts: Starting out with the ability to distinguish directions, pigeons develop a highly efficient navigational system that allows them to navigate within the range of several hundred kilometers. Some seabirds can navigate even within a range of more than thousand kilometers <ref> (see R. Wiltschko 1992 for summary) </ref>. The navigation system makes use of a variety of factors whose existence is reliable, but whose specific manifestation cannot be anticipated.

Reference-contexts: Birds treated this way were no longer oriented and departed in all directions (Fig. 3). The observation that the same magnetic treatment had no effect after arrival at the release site clearly shows that the treatment itself did not affect orientation, but only its application during displacement <ref> (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1978) </ref>. This indicates a crucial role of routespecific information from the magnetic field. Young pigeons seem to obtain their homeward course by reversing the net direction of the outward journey. This strategy has been characterized as route reversal (Schmidt-Koenig 1975; W. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1982). <p> The arrows represent the mean vectors of groups of 10 to 12 pigeons with respect to home, H; the symbols at the periphery mark the respective mean directions, solid symbol: significant directional preference; open symbol: no significant preference <ref> (data from R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1978) </ref>. 3.2.

Reference-contexts: The effect shown in Fig. 3 is restricted to very young, untrained pigeons, however. Untrained pigeons older than about 12 weeks were found to be no longer affected by depriving them of magnetic outward journey information, and neither are trained pigeons <ref> (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1985) </ref>. Other manipulations that interfered with the pigeons' access to navigational information during the outward journey likewise failed to affect adult pigeons (e.g. Walcott and Schmidt-Koenig 1973; Keeton 1974). <p> The learning processes begin as soon as young birds fly well enough to venture away from their loft, and are promoted by experience obtained on these flights. The decreasing effect of transportation in a distorted magnetic field <ref> (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1985) </ref> indicates that pigeons if left to gather their own experience, are ready to use the navigational 'map' when they are about 12 weeks old. These experiments, however, indicated considerable variability, which must be attributed to differences in how fast the 'map' develops.

Reference-contexts: Two types of factors possess the required characteristics: the geomagnetic field and celestial cues. Homing pigeons make use of both, thus having two compass mechanisms at their disposal, a magnetic compass <ref> (see R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995 for details) </ref> and a sun compass that compensates the changes in sun azimuth with the help of an internal clock (see Schmidt-Koenig 1958, R. Wiltschko 1980 for details). Both mechanisms provide birds with essentially the same type of information.
