Abstract: A compact 64-tap programmable FIR filter, suitable for TV ghost cancellation, has been designed, fabricated and tested. The design uses carry-save add-shift (CSAS) multipliers, to achieve area efficiency, and an internally generated self-timed clock, to achieve timing efficiency. The prototype chip is implemented in a die area of 12.6 mm 2 using a 0.8-m CMOS process and can operate at up to 18 MHz with a 5-V supply.

In general, a longer filter is necessary for terrestrial broadcasts than for cable systems. In all cases, a compact implementation is highly desirable to reduce the cost of this consumer-oriented system.

Reference-contexts: A fully bit-serial multiplier, while compact in size, cannot meet the 14.32 MHz data-rate requirement since an 8 fi 10-bit Booth-encoded multiplication would require a serial clock frequency in excess of 500 MHz. We therefore chose a half bit-sequential carry-save add-shift (CSAS) multiplier structure <ref> [5] </ref>, as shown in Fig. 2, for its throughput and its compactness. For an n fi m-bit CSAS structure, the n-bit multiplicand is fed in parallel and the m-bit multiplier is fed in serially (LSB first).

Reference-contexts: The serial clock needs to be generated from the input video clock on-chip. While a phase-locked loop (PLL) is commonly used to scale up the clock frequency <ref> [6] </ref>, its use here would be complicated by the fact that we need two different clock frequencies (requiring two PLLs) that are multiplexed to form a single serial clock in a perfectly synchronized manner. <p> It can be seen that our implementation is the most compact in terms of the (normalized, with respect to the technology and the number of taps) die area, at the expense of having a higher power dissipation. It should be pointed out that the chip reported in <ref> [6] </ref> contains additional delay-line registers and the chip reported in [8] implements the FIR filter in the non-transposed form. 4 CONCLUSION A compact 64-tap programmable FIR filter suitable for TV ghost cancellation has been designed, fabricated and tested. <p> The prototype chip, implemented in a die area of 12.6 mm 2 using a 0.8-m CMOS process, can operate at up to 18 MHz with a 5-V supply or 14.32 MHz with a 3.6-V supply.

Reference-contexts: The delay of the two inverters is scaled to be approximately equal to the adder's delay, which produces a nearly 50% duty-cycle clock. All the high-speed registers are implemented using the true-single-phase latch <ref> [7] </ref> for its speed as well as to ease the on-chip clock distribution. To ensure a relatively fast serial clock edge, required by the true-single-phase latch, the serial clock is distributed through three levels of buffering. The single first-level buffer is at the Fig. 6.
