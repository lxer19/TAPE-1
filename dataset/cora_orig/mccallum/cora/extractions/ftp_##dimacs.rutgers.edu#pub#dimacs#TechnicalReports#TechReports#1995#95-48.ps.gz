Reference-contexts: A combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals corresponding to genome rearrangements by inversions was introduced by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1993 [14] who suggested the first "performance guarantee" algorithm to analyze genome rearrangements. The problem was further studied by Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> who improved the Kececiouglu and Sankoff algorithm and by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1994 [15] who analyzed the performance of sorting by reversals on simulated data. More recently, Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995 [11] devised a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed fragments by reversals. <p> However, the estimate of reversal distance in terms of breakpoints is very rough and does not provide an accurate bound. The important result of Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> is that there is another "hidden" parameter which estimates reversal distance with much greater accuracy. In the following discussion, we define the model formally and present the results of computational experiments in which we analyze previously postulated scenarios of rearrangements in plant organelles. <p> It can be shown that the edges of G () can be decomposed into a collection of edge-disjoint alternating cycles (i.e. cycles whose edges change colors in every vertex). Let c () be the number of cycles in a maximal cycle decomposition. Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> show that d () n + 1 c () (0.2) The bound (0.2) in terms of maximal cycle decomposition is much tighter than the bound (0.1) in terms of the number of breakpoints/adjacencies. <p> Further, in those examples, c () is very small implying that bound (0.1) is considerably weaker than bound (0.2). Based on the notion of "maximal cycle decomposition", Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> developed a "performance guarantee" algorithm for sorting by reversals which constructed (provably) shortest evolutionary scenarios for all biological examples we studied. Table 0.1 presents the results of our program on a series of experimental data by Palmer et al. [13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28]. <p> Conclusion This paper is a condensed version of [3], which also contains some other examples where these concepts have been applied, such as comparative human-mouse mapping. Technical details, including the - 6 - algorithm are presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. The concept of cycle graphs of permutation turns out to be useful in estimating distance for other form of rearrangements as well, including transpositions [4] and translocations [9, 16].

Reference-contexts: More recently, Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995 [11] investigated the structure of cycle graphs intensively, and discovered parameters that give an exact formula for the reversal distance.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly enough, similar problems exist for such conserved genomes as plant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The point mutation rate in plant mtDNA is estimated to be 100 times slower than in animal mtDNA and many genes are 99% 99:9% identical in related species <ref> [23] </ref>. However, although there is little change in the DNA sequence of the plant mitochondrial genes from one species to another, there is rapid and extensive change in gene arrangements. <p> However, even for genomes consisting of more than 10 blocks, exhaustive search over all potential solutions is intractable.

Reference-contexts: In the very first computational studies of genome rearrangements Watterson et al., 1982 [30] introduced the notion of breakpoint (disruption of gene order) and noticed some correlations between the reversal distance and the number of breakpoints (in fact, Sturtevant and Dobzhansky, 1936 <ref> [29] </ref> implicitly discussed these correlations 60 years ago!). However, the estimate of reversal distance in terms of breakpoints is very rough and does not provide an accurate bound.

Reference-contexts: A combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals corresponding to genome rearrangements by inversions was introduced by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1993 [14] who suggested the first "performance guarantee" algorithm to analyze genome rearrangements. The problem was further studied by Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> who improved the Kececiouglu and Sankoff algorithm and by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1994 [15] who analyzed the performance of sorting by reversals on simulated data. More recently, Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995 [11] devised a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed fragments by reversals. <p> However, the estimate of reversal distance in terms of breakpoints is very rough and does not provide an accurate bound. The important result of Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> is that there is another "hidden" parameter which estimates reversal distance with much greater accuracy. In the following discussion, we define the model formally and present the results of computational experiments in which we analyze previously postulated scenarios of rearrangements in plant organelles. <p> It can be shown that the edges of G () can be decomposed into a collection of edge-disjoint alternating cycles (i.e. cycles whose edges change colors in every vertex). Let c () be the number of cycles in a maximal cycle decomposition. Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> show that d () n + 1 c () (0.2) The bound (0.2) in terms of maximal cycle decomposition is much tighter than the bound (0.1) in terms of the number of breakpoints/adjacencies. <p> Further, in those examples, c () is very small implying that bound (0.1) is considerably weaker than bound (0.2). Based on the notion of "maximal cycle decomposition", Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> developed a "performance guarantee" algorithm for sorting by reversals which constructed (provably) shortest evolutionary scenarios for all biological examples we studied. Table 0.1 presents the results of our program on a series of experimental data by Palmer et al. [13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28]. <p> Conclusion This paper is a condensed version of [3], which also contains some other examples where these concepts have been applied, such as comparative human-mouse mapping. Technical details, including the - 6 - algorithm are presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. The concept of cycle graphs of permutation turns out to be useful in estimating distance for other form of rearrangements as well, including transpositions [4] and translocations [9, 16].

Reference-contexts: A combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals corresponding to genome rearrangements by inversions was introduced by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1993 [14] who suggested the first "performance guarantee" algorithm to analyze genome rearrangements. The problem was further studied by Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> who improved the Kececiouglu and Sankoff algorithm and by Kececiouglu and Sankoff, 1994 [15] who analyzed the performance of sorting by reversals on simulated data. More recently, Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995 [11] devised a polynomial-time algorithm for sorting signed fragments by reversals. <p> However, the estimate of reversal distance in terms of breakpoints is very rough and does not provide an accurate bound. The important result of Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> is that there is another "hidden" parameter which estimates reversal distance with much greater accuracy. In the following discussion, we define the model formally and present the results of computational experiments in which we analyze previously postulated scenarios of rearrangements in plant organelles. <p> It can be shown that the edges of G () can be decomposed into a collection of edge-disjoint alternating cycles (i.e. cycles whose edges change colors in every vertex). Let c () be the number of cycles in a maximal cycle decomposition. Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> show that d () n + 1 c () (0.2) The bound (0.2) in terms of maximal cycle decomposition is much tighter than the bound (0.1) in terms of the number of breakpoints/adjacencies. <p> Further, in those examples, c () is very small implying that bound (0.1) is considerably weaker than bound (0.2). Based on the notion of "maximal cycle decomposition", Bafna and Pevzner, 1993 <ref> [2] </ref> developed a "performance guarantee" algorithm for sorting by reversals which constructed (provably) shortest evolutionary scenarios for all biological examples we studied. Table 0.1 presents the results of our program on a series of experimental data by Palmer et al.

Technical details, including the - 6 - algorithm are presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. The concept of cycle graphs of permutation turns out to be useful in estimating distance for other form of rearrangements as well, including transpositions [4] and translocations [9, 16].
