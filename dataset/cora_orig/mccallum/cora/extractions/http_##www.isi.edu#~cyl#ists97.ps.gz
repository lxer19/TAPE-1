Abstract: SUMMARIST is an attempt to create a robust automated text summarization system, based on the equation: summarization = topic identification + interpretation + generation. We describe the systems architecture and provide details of some of its modules.

Topic Extraction Interpretation Generation input text output summary English Japanese Spanish WordNet 2.1 Topic Identification Several techniques for topic identification have been reported in the literature, including methods based on Position [Luhn 58, Edmundson 69], Cue Phrases <ref> [Baxendale 58] </ref>, word frequency, and Discourse Segmentation [Marcu 97]. We describe here just our work on SUMMARISTs Position module. This method exploits the fact that in some genres, regularities of discourse structure and/or methods of exposition mean that certain sentence positions tend to carry more topic material than others.

Reference-contexts: Full sentence planning and generation: SUMMARIST will employ the sentence planner being built at ISI (in collaboration with the HealthDoc project from the University of Waterloo) [Hovy and Wanner 96], together with a sentence generator such as Penman [Penman 88, Matthiessen and Bateman 91], FUF <ref> [Elhadad 92] </ref>, or NitroGen [Knight and Hatzivassiloglou 95] to produce well-formed, fluent, summaries, taking as input the fuser concepts and their most closely related concepts as identified by SUMMARISTs topic identification stage. 3 Conclusion As outlined in Section 1, extract summaries require only the stage of topic identification.
