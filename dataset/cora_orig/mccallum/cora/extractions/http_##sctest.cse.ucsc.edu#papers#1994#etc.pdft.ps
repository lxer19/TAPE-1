Title: A Study of Undetectable Non-Feedback Shorts for the Purpose of

Abstract: Undetectable shorts may decrease the long term reliability of a circuit, cause intermittent failures, add noise or delay, or increase test pattern generation costs. This paper describes the undetectable non-feedback shorts that are likely to occur in standard cell implementations of the ISCAS'85 combinational test circuits. For ten layouts of each circuit, all shorts between adjacent wires were extracted and the undetectable ones analyzed. We found that approximately 0.4% are undetectable and that nearly half of these can be easily predicted before the physical layout of the circuit is generated. Since only a small percentage of the shorts are undetectable, and many of the undetectables are easily identifiable, it appears that it is possible to reduce the likelihood, or completely eliminate, the occurrence of a large portion of these shorts by incorporating design-for-test strategies into routing software.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, a short is undetectable if no combination of the circuit inputs will generate a discrepancy on a circuit output (static voltage testing). This means that some of the shorts we categorize as undetectable are detectable via I DDQ <ref> [Ack83] </ref> or delay testing. However, these techniques are generally more costly and less accepted than voltage-based testing. 2 Motivation Although an undetectable short does not change the logic function of a circuit, it can change other functional aspects.

Reference-contexts: Once the likely non-feedback shorts were extracted from the circuit layouts, we determined their behavior. The two most commonly used methods of modeling shorts are the wired-AND and wired-OR models. However, neither of these adequately reflects the behavior of shorts in CMOS circuits <ref> [Ack88, FL91, MG91] </ref>. The voltage of shorted nodes is determined by how strongly each gate tries to force its value on the shorted node. We computed the voltage of shorted nodes with SPICE.

Reference-contexts: Assigning a logic value based on an inverter threshold is somewhat inaccurate in that it does not take into account the differing input thresholds for different gates <ref> [AM91] </ref>; however a multi-threshold ATPG system was not readily available. Fault simulation with a single threshold value is sufficient to validate the idea of efficiently finding undetectable shorts for the purpose of P-DFT, and provides more meaningful results than the typically used wired-OR and wired-AND bridge fault models.

Reference-contexts: Nemesis' I DDQ switch causes it to generate tests for shorts by exploiting the excess quiescent current caused by two shorted nodes being driven to different logic values <ref> [FTL90] </ref>. The undetectable shorts that are non-I DDQ detectable are nonstimulatable. These two categories of non-feedback shorts, non-stimulatable and nonpropagatable, can be further divided into two sub-categories.
