Reference-contexts: The decays and are C-violating but the current experimental limits on the branching ratios (&lt; 5 %) are not very stringent. The decay has not been observed. This mode is particularly relevant since it should yield information on the quark/gluon content of the <ref> [2] </ref>. Consider the decay: (2) In the rest frame of the , the energy of the radiated photon is given by: (3) For example, the radiated photon in has only 40 MeV of energy, when the is produced in a symmetric operating at an energy corresponding to the mass.

Reference-contexts: Another striking feature of the plot is the dip at around 1 GeV. This is also seen in the S-wave projection, after a partial wave analysis (PWA) is performed (see Figure 4 (b)). This dip in the S-wave has been observed in other experiments <ref> [14] </ref> and is understood to be due to a narrow scalar at about 1 GeV in mass, interfering with a broad S-wave resonance (at about 1.3 GeV ?) The PWA also shows a rapid variation in the S-wave - D-wave phase (not shown here) at this mass, consistent with a narrow
