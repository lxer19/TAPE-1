Abstract: Current general purpose mobility solutions like Mobile-IP involve multiple router-crossings even when the mobile host moves within an intranet from one subnet of a router to another. An environment consisting of a large number of mobile hosts would congest the router causing hosts to experience high latency and jitter. This paper presents a mechanism to eliminate multiple router-crossings in a mobile intranet, which reduces the load on the routers and the hand-off and data latency at the mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: Hosts which do not implement the FA-cache protocol have to take the longer route to reach the mobile hosts. In any case, data packets incur the extra hop through the Foreign Agent, even if the mobile host was directly visible to the router. Bhagwat and Perkins <ref> [1] </ref> use IP's loose source route option to achieve the same, but suffers from the disadvantage of slower and sometimes incorrect processing of the options on the intermediate routers.

Reference-contexts: The indirect path also increases congestion at the already overloaded routers. Caceres and Padmanabhan <ref> [3] </ref> describe a method by which wireless machines moving between base-stations on the same subnet use proxy and gratuitous arps [15] to quietly accomplish a hand-off without going through the Home Agent. <p> This is not a problem for wireless mobile hosts as they act like ethernet connected machines with the base-station acting as a bridge. Mobility between connection points on the same subnet (which is not an issue for regular ethernet) is handled as in <ref> [3] </ref>: base-stations proxy for the mobile hosts and forward layer 2 frames to and from them appropriately.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in the relationship between the average packet delay D, average traffic arrival rate , and the ratio q of mobiles away from their home subnets to the total number of hosts. By applying Jackson's result for different classes (of customers) <ref> [4] </ref> on the model of figure 8, we get the following relationship between D, , and q: D = r (1 + q) 2q N ) Figures 9-a and 9-b depict the relationship between the the average delay D and the average traffic arrival rate and the ratio q respectively (We

Reference-contexts: The routes obtained are optimal and the same as those achieved by the FA-cache approaches, but at a greatly reduced administrative cost as now a campus no longer has to rely on hosts implementing the FA-cache. Cheshire and Baker <ref> [5] </ref> survey several approaches towards providing mobility, the fundamental assumption being that mobility should be transparent to routers. Based on our implementation experience and experimental results, we argue that making routers explicitly aware of mobility is a more scalable and manageable approach.

Reference-contexts: The router (graf) is an Intel pentium machine running the 4.4BSD ip forwarding code. MH is an Intel 486 (mobile host) with an IP address on the virtual mobile subnet. CH1 and CH2 are correspondent hosts on physical subnets 46 and 126 respectively. All hosts run BSD/OS 2.1 <ref> [8] </ref> and are connected via 10Mbps ethernet. The following subsections give a brief sketch of the implementation issues and present experimental results which corroborate our approach. 4.1 Handoff The mobile hosts connect to the network using PCMCIA ethernet cards.

In the reduced mobility scheme, CH2 and MH1 communicate through the router without involving HA, saving the extra hop. The latencies are compared in figure 5 and are lower for the reduced protocol.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 discusses the scalability issues. Finally, section 6 presents our conclusion and discusses some ideas for future research. 2 Related Work The Mobile-IP specification <ref> [11] </ref> allows mobile hosts to move between subnets by maintaining a forwarding pointer at the mobile host's Home Agent. Ordinarily, every time the host changes its subnet (and hence its Foreign Agent) a registration request is sent back to the Home Agent.

Reference-contexts: For movement between subnets in the same administrative domain, a hierarchy of Foreign Agents similar to one described in <ref> [12] </ref> is suggested, where the hand-off latency following a move is decreased by using hierarchical Foreign Agents which shield the remote Home Agent from the knowledge of a local move.

Reference-contexts: Bhagwat and Perkins [1] use IP's loose source route option to achieve the same, but suffers from the disadvantage of slower and sometimes incorrect processing of the options on the intermediate routers. Perkins and Luo <ref> [14] </ref> use explicit assignment of new care-of IP addresses, local to the current point of attachment to effect mobility as well as as a direct data path. However, this requires the availability of DHCP servers and forces mobile hosts to implement a Foreign Agent.
