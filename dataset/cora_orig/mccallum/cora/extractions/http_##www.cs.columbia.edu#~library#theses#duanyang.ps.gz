Reference-contexts: Secondly, Shu*eNet uses a small, fixed number of transceivers per network access node and provides nearly optimal throughput under uniform traffic. Because of its symmetry and regularity, it has simple and efficient routing schemes, both deterministic and adaptive <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988; Acampora and Ali-Shah, 1992 ] </ref> . Before we find a proper fiber topology to realize a Shu*eNet-cluster, we must decide what is the good fiber topology to realize an individual Shu*eNet.

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) supports concurrent transmissions on a single optical fiber, with the potential of relieving this electronic bottleneck and allowing the bandwidth to grow linearly with the number of optical channels deployed <ref> [ Acampora and Karol, 1989 ] </ref> . One general architecture in WDM networks is the broadcast-and-select networks, of which passive star network is an example. In this architecture, stations with fixed-tuned transmitters transmit packets in different wavelengths to a passive star coupler.

Hyper-Cluster Overview We propose a novel network architecture called hyper-cluster for ATM-based multi-channel multi-hop networks. This architecture has the modular scalability and the modular reconfigurability under the peer model.

Reference-contexts: For example, an exact expression for Shu*eNets with uniform traffic demonstrates that, for large N , the expected number of hops scales roughly as log P N and the total capacity as N fl P= log P N <ref> [ Acampora, 1987 ] </ref> . When the traffic patterns are non-uniform, or when regular connection graphs cannot be used, simple expressions for network capacity cannot be produced. <p> DARPA packet-radio project [ Kahn et al., 1978 ] , Amateur-Radio Project [ Kahn et al., 1985 ] and Cellular Digital Packet Data network (CDPD)). To eliminate the need for tunable transmitters and receivers in multi-channel lightwave networks, Acampora <ref> [ Acampora, 1987 ] </ref> proposed a multi-hop lightwave network architecture. A multi-hop lightwave network consists of a 92 shared optical medium and geographically dispersed access stations which contain the ports through which users attach to the network. <p> The wavelengths for transmitting and receiving were proposed to be assigned to achieve an optical connectivity with perfect shu*e interconnections, called Shu*eNet in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . Later, other regular graphs such as de Bruijn graphs [ Sivarajan and Ramaswami, 1994 ] and many others have been proposed. They let each access node have a constant number of transceivers. <p> It is denoted as S (K; P ). In Fig 4.3, a Shu*eNet with 2 stages is shown. For a re-circulating perfect Shu*eNet, the diameter is 2K 1. Under uniform traffic, the average number of hops can be derived as follows <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> : EfHopsg = 3 fl (K 1) + P K : (4.1) 101 4.2.2 Hyper-Cluster Structure We first use an example to illustrate the basic idea of hyper-clusters and the difference from hierarchical networks. <p> When a new node is added, it joins a base hyper-cell where this new node has the closest tie in terms of traffic distribution. For the case where a hyper-cell is a Shu*eNet, the "attaching" scheme described in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987 ] </ref> can be used. When the number of nodes in this expanded hyper-cell exceeds a limit, the hyper-cell splits|some nodes of this hyper-cell form a new hyper-cell. <p> Multi-hop WDM networks require neither rapidly-tunable transceivers nor extensive transmission coordinations, compared to single-hop WDM networks <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . They enjoy increasing prominence as viable candidates for ATM-based high-speed local, metropolitan and wide-area networks [ Green, 1992; Mukherjee, 1992b; Sivarajan and Ramaswami, 1994 ] . <p> In the cases of bus and star, while the layouts on the fiber layer are simple, they demand an excessive number of wavelengths (or fibers if no WDM is used) for supporting an individual Shu*eNet. In <ref> [ Acampora, 1987 ] </ref> , a Shu*eNet embedded on a dual fiber bus with 160 nodes uses as many as 320 wavelengths. <p> In [ Karol and Gitlin, 1990 ] , a multi-connected point-to-point fiber ring is suggested to realize a Shu*eNet where still a moderately large number of fibers are required. Various approaches are proposed to avoid the problem. One approach is to share one wavelength among multiple optical connections <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . This brings a multiple access problem which results in additional complexity and inefficiency, especially for bursty traffic. Furthermore, a large number of wavelengths are still required even for a Shu*eNet, let alone a Shu*eNet-cluster. <p> Furthermore, a large number of wavelengths are still required even for a Shu*eNet, let alone a Shu*eNet-cluster. For examples, 64 wavelengths are needed for a 160-node Shuf-fleNet on a dual fiber bus in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987 ] </ref> and 80 wavelengths are needed for a 160-node Shu*eNet on a dual-star fiber network in [ Hluchyj and Karol, 141 1988 ] , after sharing one wavelength among multiple optical connections in TDMA. <p> The problem of realizing a Shu*eNet-cluster with a fiber mesh network is discussed in Section 5.4. We conclude the chapter in Section 5.5. 142 5.2 Shu*eNet and Hypercube 5.2.1 Shu*eNet S (k; p) We give an overview on Shu*eNet introduced in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . Shu*eNet refers to a multi-hop WDM network using a generalized perfect shu*e as the optical connectivity. A Shu*eNet consists of interconnected network access nodes, each of which has a small number (e.g., two) of transceivers accessing optical channels.

Reference-contexts: The static routing policy can be a major cause for congestion, especially under bursty traffic. Studies show routing and congestion control are closely related to each other [ Rudin and Mueller, 1980 ] . Adaptive routing algorithms, such as the alternative path routing algorithm and the deflection routing algorithm <ref> [ Bahk and Zarki, 1992 ] </ref> have been suggested to bridge between routing and congestion control. Adaptive routing results in a lower blocking probability at the expense of a longer path for a call, which consumes more network bandwidth and introduces longer network delay.

Reference-contexts: Since traffic in large networks is usually highly nonuniform, this approach is not applicable to building large networks. Accordingly, attention was turned to optimizing the logical connectivity based on the traffic demand <ref> [ Bannister et al., 1990a; Labourdette and Acampora, 1990a ] </ref> . While this approach can achieve excellent network efficiency for a given traffic distribution, the time complexities of those algorithms are usually very high.

Reference-contexts: The interest in hypercube is intensified by commercial available hypercube-based parallel computers such as NCUBE [ NCUBE, 1985 ] and iPSC/2 <ref> [ Bomans and Roose, 1989 ] </ref> . A hypercube can be recursively constructed: let the initial 0-dimensional hypercube be a single node; a (k+1)-dimensional hypercube is formed by connecting two k-dimensional hypercubes between their corresponding nodes.

Reference-contexts: This can be shown in Fig. 6.6. The technology of AOTF is currently pursued by researchers in the Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) <ref> [ Brackett et al., 1993 ] </ref> . We now can use spectrum filters to realize a ring-cluster. Each wheel is attached with a spectrum filter. These spectrum filters are interconnected into a ring by fibers. In Figure 6.7, we illustrate the method to form the interconnecting wheels.

Reference-contexts: For example, Mach-Zehnder tunable filter supports about 128 channels at the tuning speed of a microsecond, and Acousto-optic TE/TM supports around 100 channels at the tuning speed of 10 s. The DFB Filter Amplifier can reach tuning speed of 1 ns, but can only support 2-3 channels <ref> [ Brackett, 1990 ] </ref> . This chapter presents scalable media-access (MAC) protocols for high-speed optical passive star networks. We first review some of the protocols that have been proposed in the literature. It is not intended as a complete and exhaustive survey of the area. <p> The other filters, such as Fabry-Perot type [ Dono et al., 1990 ] can only get tuning speed in the order of a few milliseconds. A review of the current status about tunable receivers can be found in <ref> [ Brackett, 1990 ] </ref> . During the period of tuning, a receiver cannot be utilized; this requires that a corresponding transmitter synchronize with a receiver by postponing the transmission. If the tuning time equals to the packet transmission time, 50% of channel bandwidth is essentially lost due to tuning.

Reference-contexts: The first technique, called shared parallel queuing, is to associate a small constant number of parallel queues with one data channel, rather than one deep queue (as in DT-WDMA [ Chen et al., 1990 ] ) or N static queues (as in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , N is the number of stations). This significantly reduces both the hardware resource requirement and the control signaling demand. <p> Thus the protocol can be scaled up for networks with a reasonably large number of stations and could lead to a potential implementation. In the second part of Chapter 2, the work is motivated by the fact that the protocols proposed in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991; Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> as well as in the first part of Chapter 2, although highly efficient, require that each station be at the same distance to the star coupler. <p> If more than one packet is heading to one station, only one packet is received and the others have to be re-sent. The maximum achievable throughput is 60% for uniform traffic due to the contention. Various extensions of DT-WDMA have been proposed to improve the throughput <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991; Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . These protocols require each station to have N waiting queues (N is the network size). As in DT-WDMA, packet arrivals are announced over the control channel. <p> They advance DT-WDMA and its variants with the following concerns: * In DT-WDMA, the maximum achievable throughput rate is 0.6 even under uniform traffic; * The tuning time of the filter is a significant overhead not considered by either DT-WDMA or its variants; * The variants of DT-WDMA in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991; Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> require each station to have N queues and maintain an N fiN matrix for scheduling. <p> The resource requirement is expensive; * The signaling on the control channel limits the number of stations supported in the variants of DT-WDMA and thus prevents scaling up the network. Our first observation is that DT-WDMA uses one queue per station, and its variants <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] uses N queues per station. Intuitively, the more queues in each station, the more chance the transmitter can successfully make contention-free scheduling. <p> More parallel queues provide more leeway for packets to pass the blocked packets. On the other hand, in a network with N stations, it is too expensive for one station to use N fixed parallel queues, as in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] . We use a small constant number (K) of shared parallel queues, each of which is shared by multiple stations. <p> We use a small constant number (K) of shared parallel queues, each of which is shared by multiple stations. We show our architecture in Figure 2.2, which is compared to the architectures 25 of [ Chen et al., 1990 ] , <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. Note that DT-WDMA (see Figure 2.3) has one deep queue per station while our architecture requires K "shared" parallel queues per station. In [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti <p> of [ Chen et al., 1990 ] , <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. Note that DT-WDMA (see Figure 2.3) has one deep queue per station while our architecture requires K "shared" parallel queues per station. In [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] (see Figure 2.4), a station needs N queues and queueing is static; that is, a station buffers a packet destined to station i in the i th queue. <p> In our architecture, a station buffers packets in K parallel queues in a shared manner. per station As a result, the hardware requirement is much less expensive than that in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] | while a total of N flN queues are required in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , here KflN queues are required. <p> station buffers packets in K parallel queues in a shared manner. per station As a result, the hardware requirement is much less expensive than that in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] | while a total of N flN queues are required in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , here KflN queues are required. The ratio of queueing resource requirement here to that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] is K=N . <p> Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] | while a total of N flN queues are required in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , here KflN queues are required. The ratio of queueing resource requirement here to that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] is K=N . When N=127 and K=5, the ratio is 4%. Because K is shown to be a small constant (5 or 6), the queueing resource 26 station is comparable to that in DT-WDMA. <p> Because K is shown to be a small constant (5 or 6), the queueing resource 26 station is comparable to that in DT-WDMA. In Sections 2.5 and 2.6, we show that the performances under our architecture are very close to those in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991; Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> and significantly higher than that in DT-WDMA. <p> When packet size is 1024 bits, N is at most 32. The savings of queueing resource and control signalling bandwidth make our protocols scalable and practical for implementation. The question left is whether our protocols can yield performance as high as the protocols in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] . This will be answered in Section 2.5 and 2.6. 2.2.4 Data Structure for Scheduling Each station bookkeeps the destination addresses of outstanding packets in all the parallel queues. <p> We show that the protocols using a small number of parallel queues can achieve performances as high as protocols in [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] and <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> while demanding much lower control signalling bandwidth and less hardware resource. One of the difficulties in analyzing the performance of protocols comes from the correlation between transmissions in different slots. <p> We see that there is a slight throughput improvement with "destination-dependent queueing" (see 2.6.2 Non-uniform Traffic We consider that the arrival rate for each station is 1 but the distribution pattern is not uniform. We borrow the following distribution matrix from <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> . It results in significantly heavier traffic destined to some receivers and lighter traffic destined to the other receivers. <p> Using shared parallel queueing, each station is equipped with a small constant number (about 5-6) of shared queues to reduce head-of-line effects. This architecture has a significantly lower hardware resource requirement while capable of yielding a throughput surprisingly as high as in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] . <p> Below, we present a summary of the results: * The protocols yield the maximum throughput close to unity without consid ering tuning overhead; * While the performance of the protocols is similar to those achieved by protocols in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , each station requires a small constant number of queues, instead of N queues as in [ Chen 66 delay is: d [1]=1, d [i]=5 for i=2, ,20; SSW is a new protocol presented in this chapter; C-scheme

Intuitively, the more queues in each station, the more chance the transmitter can successfully make contention-free scheduling. <p> Motivated by this observation, we propose a scheme called shared parallel queueing: besides one waiting queue, each station is equipped with a small number of queues, called "shared parallel queues," for each data channel to gain more leeway. In <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> , the arriving packets to different destinations are queued in different queues. Under shared parallel queueing, the number of parallel queues is a small constant and packets to different destinations share parallel queues. <p> Under shared parallel queueing, the number of parallel queues is a small constant and packets to different destinations share parallel queues. This requires less resource and surprisingly the throughput is almost identical to that of <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> when the number of parallel queues is 5 or 6. The constant number is called "parallel index," denoted as K henceforth. The time complexity of the optimal scheduling is shown to be O (N 1:5 ). <p> More parallel queues provide more leeway for packets to pass the blocked packets. On the other hand, in a network with N stations, it is too expensive for one station to use N fixed parallel queues, as in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . We use a small constant number (K) of shared parallel queues, each of which is shared by multiple stations. <p> We use a small constant number (K) of shared parallel queues, each of which is shared by multiple stations. We show our architecture in Figure 2.2, which is compared to the architectures 25 of [ Chen et al., 1990 ] , [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. Note that DT-WDMA (see Figure 2.3) has one deep queue per station while our architecture requires K "shared" parallel queues per station. In [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] (see Figure 2.4), <p> , [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. Note that DT-WDMA (see Figure 2.3) has one deep queue per station while our architecture requires K "shared" parallel queues per station. In [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] (see Figure 2.4), a station needs N queues and queueing is static; that is, a station buffers a packet destined to station i in the i th queue. <p> In our architecture, a station buffers packets in K parallel queues in a shared manner. per station As a result, the hardware requirement is much less expensive than that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> | while a total of N flN queues are required in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , here KflN queues are required. <p> in a shared manner. per station As a result, the hardware requirement is much less expensive than that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> | while a total of N flN queues are required in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , here KflN queues are required. The ratio of queueing resource requirement here to that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] is K=N . When N=127 and K=5, the ratio is 4%. <p> al., 1993 ] | while a total of N flN queues are required in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> , here KflN queues are required. The ratio of queueing resource requirement here to that in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] is K=N . When N=127 and K=5, the ratio is 4%. Because K is shown to be a small constant (5 or 6), the queueing resource 26 station is comparable to that in DT-WDMA. <p> Because K is shown to be a small constant (5 or 6), the queueing resource 26 station is comparable to that in DT-WDMA. In Sections 2.5 and 2.6, we show that the performances under our architecture are very close to those in <ref> [ Chen and Yum, 1991; Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> and significantly higher than that in DT-WDMA. <p> The slotted channel structure is illustrated in Figure 2.5. When an out-bound packet arrives at a station, the destination address of this packet is broadcasted on the control channel in one mini-slot. In <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> , a station uses one bit to signal an arrival in each queue. Since there 28 are N queues per station, it thus requires N bits every mini-slot per station. The control signalling demand is thus N 2 bits per control slot. <p> However, since a station has only one data channel, the mean arrival rate at one station is at most one packet per slot to avoid buffer blocking (or overflowing). For this reason, most of the information in the control packets is redundant in <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . Specifically, most of the control bits are 0's. We propose that a station announces only one packet arrival instead of all new arrivals. The destination address of an outbound packet is adequately coded. <p> If K is 5, our approach using "dynamic queueing" policy can support as many as 102 30 stations ( 102fldlog (5 fl (102+1))e 1024). Recall that excessive control signalling demand is the major obstacle for scaling up the network in scheme DAS <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> , because DAS requires N 2 bits per slot. When packet size is 1024 bits, N is at most 32. The savings of queueing resource and control signalling bandwidth make our protocols scalable and practical for implementation. <p> The savings of queueing resource and control signalling bandwidth make our protocols scalable and practical for implementation. The question left is whether our protocols can yield performance as high as the protocols in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . This will be answered in Section 2.5 and 2.6. 2.2.4 Data Structure for Scheduling Each station bookkeeps the destination addresses of outstanding packets in all the parallel queues. Let Q (i,j) be the j th parallel queue in station i. <p> We show that the protocols using a small number of parallel queues can achieve performances as high as protocols in <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> and [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] while demanding much lower control signalling bandwidth and less hardware resource. One of the difficulties in analyzing the performance of protocols comes from the correlation between transmissions in different slots. <p> The analytical model is exactly identical to the model presented in <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . Between protocol SSW and the conventional approach, the difference is the network delay. <p> Using shared parallel queueing, each station is equipped with a small constant number (about 5-6) of shared queues to reduce head-of-line effects. This architecture has a significantly lower hardware resource requirement while capable of yielding a throughput surprisingly as high as in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> . <p> Below, we present a summary of the results: * The protocols yield the maximum throughput close to unity without consid ering tuning overhead; * While the performance of the protocols is similar to those achieved by protocols in [ Chen and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> , each station requires a small constant number of queues, instead of N queues as in [ Chen 66 delay is: d [1]=1, d [i]=5 for i=2, ,20; SSW is a new protocol presented in this chapter; C-scheme is the conventional approach; traffic is uniform. <p> , each station requires a small constant number of queues, instead of N queues as in [ Chen 66 delay is: d [1]=1, d [i]=5 for i=2, ,20; SSW is a new protocol presented in this chapter; C-scheme is the conventional approach; traffic is uniform. and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> ; scaling up networks is thus possible; * Using shared parallel queueing, the protocols demand much less control signalling bandwidth than DAS in [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] and thus relieve the signalling bottleneck. <p> is a new protocol presented in this chapter; C-scheme is the conventional approach; traffic is uniform. and Yum, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] </ref> ; scaling up networks is thus possible; * Using shared parallel queueing, the protocols demand much less control signalling bandwidth than DAS in [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] and thus relieve the signalling bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: The wavelengths for transmitting and receiving were proposed to be assigned to achieve an optical connectivity with perfect shu*e interconnections, called Shu*eNet in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . Later, other regular graphs such as de Bruijn graphs [ Sivarajan and Ramaswami, 1994 ] and many others have been proposed. They let each access node have a constant number of transceivers. <p> It is denoted as S (K; P ). In Fig 4.3, a Shu*eNet with 2 stages is shown. For a re-circulating perfect Shu*eNet, the diameter is 2K 1. Under uniform traffic, the average number of hops can be derived as follows <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> : EfHopsg = 3 fl (K 1) + P K : (4.1) 101 4.2.2 Hyper-Cluster Structure We first use an example to illustrate the basic idea of hyper-clusters and the difference from hierarchical networks. <p> A derived address can change, after a hyper-cluster is reconfigured. In Figure 4.6, node 1 has a derived address 1@1.1 (at level 2) as well 109 as base address 1@1.1.1 (at level 1). The hyper-cluster routing algorithm (HCR) uses the self-routing algorithm proposed for Shu*eNet in <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> as a subroutine. The detail of this algorithm can be found in [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] . <p> The hyper-cluster routing algorithm (HCR) uses the self-routing algorithm proposed for Shu*eNet in <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> as a subroutine. The detail of this algorithm can be found in [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] . When we use a regular topology as the building block of a hyper-cluster, we can have an efficient and scalable routing scheme in which no routing table is required. <p> We quantify the deflection of routing in a hyper-cluster with a parameter and propose a routing scheme called quantified deflection routing for a Shu*eNet. This scheme uses the self-routing in <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> to search for the path starting at the source station. When an out-bound link suggested by the self-routing does not have enough capacity for this call, the algorithm randomly chooses another out-bound link and a deflection from the self-routing path results. <p> Multi-hop WDM networks require neither rapidly-tunable transceivers nor extensive transmission coordinations, compared to single-hop WDM networks <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . They enjoy increasing prominence as viable candidates for ATM-based high-speed local, metropolitan and wide-area networks [ Green, 1992; Mukherjee, 1992b; Sivarajan and Ramaswami, 1994 ] . <p> Secondly, Shu*eNet uses a small, fixed number of transceivers per network access node and provides nearly optimal throughput under uniform traffic. Because of its symmetry and regularity, it has simple and efficient routing schemes, both deterministic and adaptive <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988; Acampora and Ali-Shah, 1992 ] </ref> . Before we find a proper fiber topology to realize a Shu*eNet-cluster, we must decide what is the good fiber topology to realize an individual Shu*eNet. <p> In [ Karol and Gitlin, 1990 ] , a multi-connected point-to-point fiber ring is suggested to realize a Shu*eNet where still a moderately large number of fibers are required. Various approaches are proposed to avoid the problem. One approach is to share one wavelength among multiple optical connections <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . This brings a multiple access problem which results in additional complexity and inefficiency, especially for bursty traffic. Furthermore, a large number of wavelengths are still required even for a Shu*eNet, let alone a Shu*eNet-cluster. <p> The problem of realizing a Shu*eNet-cluster with a fiber mesh network is discussed in Section 5.4. We conclude the chapter in Section 5.5. 142 5.2 Shu*eNet and Hypercube 5.2.1 Shu*eNet S (k; p) We give an overview on Shu*eNet introduced in <ref> [ Acampora, 1987; Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> . Shu*eNet refers to a multi-hop WDM network using a generalized perfect shu*e as the optical connectivity. A Shu*eNet consists of interconnected network access nodes, each of which has a small number (e.g., two) of transceivers accessing optical channels. <p> + 2 fl r 2 + 3 fl r 3 + + (H 1) fl r H1 + H fl [N r H 1 N 197 1 ) fl H (r 1) 2 fl N This bound is a variation of the Moor bound [ Chen, 1976 ] (also see <ref> [ Hluchyj and Karol, 1988 ] </ref> and [ Sivarajan and Ramaswami, 1994 ] ).

Multi-hop packet-radio routing has been studied in a number of important projects (e.g. DARPA packet-radio project [ Kahn et al., 1978 ] , Amateur-Radio Project <ref> [ Kahn et al., 1985 ] </ref> and Cellular Digital Packet Data network (CDPD)). To eliminate the need for tunable transmitters and receivers in multi-channel lightwave networks, Acampora [ Acampora, 1987 ] proposed a multi-hop lightwave network architecture.

Various approaches are proposed to avoid the problem.

They investigate the maximum matchings in sparse random graphs, where the number of edges expected is a constant times the number of vertices.

Reference-contexts: Since traffic in large networks is usually highly nonuniform, this approach is not applicable to building large networks. Accordingly, attention was turned to optimizing the logical connectivity based on the traffic demand <ref> [ Bannister et al., 1990a; Labourdette and Acampora, 1990a ] </ref> . While this approach can achieve excellent network efficiency for a given traffic distribution, the time complexities of those algorithms are usually very high.

Packet-switched networks are used in local, metropolitan, and wide area networks [ Tanenbaum, 1981; Fraser, 1983; Acampora and Hluchyj, 1984; Maxemchuk, 1985 ] to form hierarchical structures that efficiently share expensive transmission facilities.

Reference-contexts: Random access protocols such as ALOHA and slotted ALOHA have limited channel utilization; CSMA/CD performs poorly as performance depends highly on the packet length to propagation delay ratio.

For a comprehensive survey, the readers should consult <ref> [ Mukherjee, 1992a ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Each station has to maintain an N fiN matrix to gather the global destination information for contention-free scheduling. The control signalling remains the bottleneck to scale up the network. This is a serious drawback. The problem has been attacked in <ref> [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993; P.A. Humblet and Sivarajan, 1993 ] </ref> . In [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , a second protocol, called Hybrid TDM (HTDM), is to let a ration of transmission slots assigned statically using TDM. <p> Humblet and Sivarajan, 1993 ] . In [ Chipalkatti et al., 1993 ] , a second protocol, called Hybrid TDM (HTDM), is to let a ration of transmission slots assigned statically using TDM. This lowers the control signalling demand at the expense of the throughput. In <ref> [ P.A. Humblet and Sivarajan, 1993 ] </ref> , more than one control channel is used to overcome the control signaling bottleneck. This technique however requires 2N wavelengths for a network of N stations. 21 There is another serious drawback introduced by the extensions of DT-WDMA.

Reference-contexts: Smaller communities in turn form larger loose communities according to community interests. A hierarchical clustering structure can be obtained given a traffic distribution using various clustering techniques in <ref> [ Hagouel, 1983; Ramamoorthy et al., 1987 ] </ref> . Initially, the nodes in each community at the lowest level are connected by a base hyper-cell. For example, in Figure 4.5, there are four base hyper-cells (S 1 , S 2 ; S 3 , and S 4 ).

Reference-contexts: The static routing policy can be a major cause for congestion, especially under bursty traffic. Studies show routing and congestion control are closely related to each other <ref> [ Rudin and Mueller, 1980 ] </ref> .
