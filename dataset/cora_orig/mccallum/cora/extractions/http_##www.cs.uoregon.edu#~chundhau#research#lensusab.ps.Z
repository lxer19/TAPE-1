Reference-contexts: Second, as advocated by Douglas (1993), we wanted to use CA as a tool for identifying and remedying problems with the Lens user interface, especially with respect to the two serious forms of Suchmanian <ref> (Suchman 1987) </ref> breakdown: the false alarm , and the garden path ; in doing so, we hoped to provide the Lens designers at Georgia Tech (Sougata Mukherjea and John Stasko) with a constructive review of their system, which could then be considered in the design of a new, improved version.
