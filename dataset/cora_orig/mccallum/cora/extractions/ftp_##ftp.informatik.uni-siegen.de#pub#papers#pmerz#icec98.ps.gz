Abstract: NK-landscapes offer the ability to assess the performance of evolutionary algorithms on problems with different degrees of epistasis. In this paper, we study the performance of six algorithms in NK-landscapes with low and high dimension while keeping the amount of epistatic interactions constant. The results show that compared to genetic local search algorithms, the performance of standard genetic algorithms employing crossover or mutation significantly decreases with increasing problem size. Furthermore, with increasing K, crossover based algorithms are in both cases outperformed by mutation based algorithms. However, the relative performance differences between the algorithms grow significantly with the dimension of the search space, indicating that it is important to consider high-dimensional landscapes for evaluating the performance of evolutionary algorithms.

Reference-contexts: However, further experiments (e.g. other values of K and N , other problem instances) are required to support this claim. In the past, new algorithms have often been tested on a small set of test problems, such as the De Jong test suite <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to prevent researchers from tuning their algorithms for a small set of problems, problem generators have been proposed [4].

This paper suggests that it is im-portant not only to focus on randomly generated problems with high epistasis and multimodality, but also to investi gate the effects of high dimensionality.
