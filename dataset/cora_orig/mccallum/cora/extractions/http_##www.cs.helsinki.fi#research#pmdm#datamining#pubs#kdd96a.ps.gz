Abstract: In interactive data mining it is advantageous to have condensed representations of data that can be used to efficiently answer different queries. In this paper we show how frequent sets can be used as a condensed representation for answering various types of queries. Given a table r with 0/1 values and a threshold , a frequent set of r is a set X of columns of r such that at least a fraction of the rows of r have a 1 in all the columns of X. Finding frequent sets is a first step in finding association rules, and there exists several efficient algorithms for finding the frequent sets. We show that frequent sets have wider applications than just finding association rules. We show that using the inclusion-exclusion principle one can obtain approximate confidences of arbitrary boolean rules. We derive bounds for the errors in the confidences, and show that information collected during the computation of frequent sets can also be used to provide individual error bounds for each clause. Experiments show that this method enables one to obtain different forms of rules from data extremely fast. Furthermore, we define a general notion of condensed representations, and show that frequent sets, samples and the data cube can be viewed as instantations of this concept.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the relation contains the attribute Age, one can look for rules containing derived binary attributes such as "Age 40". cuss how the use of frequent sets, samples and the data cube <ref> (Gray et al. 1996) </ref> can be viewed as instances of this general concept. Our concept can be viewed as a generalization of the notion of "-approximations from computational geometry (Haussler & Welzl 1987; Mulmuley 1993). <p> Concise representations In this section we outline a general definition of what it means to represent a class of structures by another, with respect to a set of queries. We discuss how the use of samples, the use of frequent sets, and the data cube <ref> (Gray et al. 1996) </ref> can could be viewed as examples of the same general idea. The concept is based on the notion of "-approximations widely used in computational geometry and in computational learning theory (Haussler & Welzl 1987; Mulmuley 1993). <p> The existence result for "-approximations was proved by Vapnik and Chervonenkis, and the sizes of such approximations are naturally connected with the VC-dimension (Vapnik 1982). One can show that samples provide an "-adequate representation for finite query classes. The data cube <ref> (Gray et al. 1996) </ref> is a recently introduced summarizing representation for relations with arbitrary values. Using the concepts above, the data cube is 0-adequate representation for the class of queries containing all aggregate functions.
