Reference-contexts: it is better to manage large portions of data by means of a DBMS; * as [ Borgida and Brachman, 1993 ] mentions, KB based on DL are often used in applications where they need access to large amounts of data stored in already existing databases; * as observed in <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994; Bresciani, 1992 ] </ref> , the task of acquiring knowledge for a real knowledge based application often includes a great amount of raw data collecting; for this subtask instead of using an ABox often it is better to use databases. <p> In particular we faced these problems when we were developing a large natural language system prototype <ref> [ Bresciani, 1992 ] </ref> , whose domain and linguistic model were represented using LOOM [ MacGre-gor, 1991 ] . <p> In our first implementation of the system 4 the DLMS is LOOM [ MacGregor, 1991 ] , and the database query language is SQL, but also other systems could be easily used. At present our tool is used in a natural language dialogue system prototype <ref> [ Bresciani, 1992 ] </ref> , whose domain and linguistic knowledge is represented in a LOOM KB and, for some large amount of raw data, in an INGRES DB.

Reference-contexts: it is better to manage large portions of data by means of a DBMS; * as [ Borgida and Brachman, 1993 ] mentions, KB based on DL are often used in applications where they need access to large amounts of data stored in already existing databases; * as observed in <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994; Bresciani, 1992 ] </ref> , the task of acquiring knowledge for a real knowledge based application often includes a great amount of raw data collecting; for this subtask instead of using an ABox often it is better to use databases. <p> Our technique <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994 ] </ref> will be in the following briefly reviewed. <p> A mapping called P M (see section 3) between the TBox and the DBox is needed. Therefore, a knowledge base KB = hT ; W; D; P M i <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994 ] </ref> is formed by a terminology T and a world description W as usual [ Nebel, 1990 ] , plus a data base D and the mapping function P M . <p> From the definition of answer to a query, it is obvious that, to avoid the generation of huge answer sets, free variables must not be used, that is, each variable appearing in x must appear also in the query body. Indeed, even stronger restrictions are adopted (see <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994 ] </ref> ). To be answered, a query must be split into sub-queries that can be answered by the two specialized query answering functions of the DLMS and the DBMS. <p> Using this representation it is possible to formulate an algorithm to efficiently cope with the merging of answers sets, as described in <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994 ] </ref> . 5 Conclusions Our approach to deal with the task of integrating DLMS and DBMS, so that KB and DB can be uniformly queried from a DLMS, has been presented. <p> The study 4 Indeed, the answering algorithm has been implemented in a more sophisticated way than the one presented in section 4, including also optimizations for reducing the number of accesses to the DB (see <ref> [ Bresciani, 1994 ] </ref> ). The pre-compilation part of the method shown in section 3 that allows dealing with non primitive concepts is presently not yet fully implemented. of the use of even more complex query-languages is part of our future plans.

Reference-contexts: The importance of KR has been regarded as fundamental for the construction of good Intelligent Information Systems for more than ten years (see, e.g., [ Tou et al., 1982 ] ), but only recently the theoretical foundations of a DL approach to DB have been established <ref> [ Buchheit et al., 1994 ] </ref> . From another point of view, KR-based applications and, more generally, AI-based applications can be widely enhanced by AI/DB interfaces [ Pastor et al., 1992; McKay et al., 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: possible way to couple DLMS and DBMS are proposed: * loose coupling, that requires a pre-loading of the data from the DB into the KB; * tight coupling, that implements a on demand access to the DB; but in the system there presented only the loose coupling paradigm is implemented <ref> [ Devanbu, 1993; Borgida and Brachman, 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: By means of the DBox it is possible to couple the DLMS with several, possibly distributed and heterogeneous, DBMS, and to use all the systems for uniformly answering queries to knowledge bases realized with this extended paradigm. In our first implementation of the system 4 the DLMS is LOOM <ref> [ MacGregor, 1991 ] </ref> , and the database query language is SQL, but also other systems could be easily used.

A uniform query answering function to KB, based on the two distinct complete query answering functions (one for the ABox and one for the DBox), can be implemented.
