Reference-contexts: In the former case, systems generating enable-ment text cannot determine which step to use when constructing a purpose clause. In the later case, those systems may select a step whose effect is undone before the condition is needed, effectively describing an unsound plan. Balkanski <ref> (Balkanski 1994) </ref>, Di Euge-nio (DiEugenio 1993b) and Delin, et al (Delin et al. 1994) encounter what are essentially the same difficulties during text interpretation, in the post-hoc analysis of instructional text corpora by human analysts.

Reference-contexts: Instead, the composite step remains in the plan, the subplan steps are added and explicitly marked as children by decompositional links. Finally, unlike systems that build hierarchical plans bottom-up via plan parsing <ref> (Barrett & Weld 1994) </ref>, DPOCL's control structure allows plans to be built in a top-down manner.

Reference-contexts: Another critical aspect of task-related discourse is the ability to describe the intentional relations that hold between actions. In Bratman's <ref> (Bratman 1987) </ref> account of intentionality, intention commits an agent to action and acts as a filter on what intentions can subsequently be adopted.

Reference-contexts: Generation is the relationship that holds between two actions when the act of performing one action is a way of performing the other essentially the first action acts as a one-action subplan for performing the second. The following definitions are abbreviated versions of those found in Di Eugenio <ref> (DiEugenio 1993b) </ref>: Definition 1 (Generation) Action ff directly generates action fi if and only if 1) ff is not part of doing fi, 2) ff and fi are actions performed by the same agent at the same time, 3) there are a set of generation-enabling conditions C that hold during the <p> In the former case, systems generating enable-ment text cannot determine which step to use when constructing a purpose clause. In the later case, those systems may select a step whose effect is undone before the condition is needed, effectively describing an unsound plan. Balkanski (Balkanski 1994), Di Euge-nio <ref> (DiEugenio 1993b) </ref> and Delin, et al (Delin et al. 1994) encounter what are essentially the same difficulties during text interpretation, in the post-hoc analysis of instructional text corpora by human analysts. Further questions must be answered, however, before appropriate textual descriptions of action can be generated from this representation. <p> As Di Eugenio describes, negative imperatives, constructs of the form "Do not do ff," express directives to avoid conflict <ref> (DiEugenio 1993b) </ref>. When a generation system detects that an agent may form a flawed plan with a threatened causal link, a negative imperative can be used to suggest avoiding the threat, as described in the previous example with Stu and Lou.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Knowledge representation schemes for the automatic generation of action-related natural language must account for the relationships commonly described in naturally occurring text. Previous work representing action in task-related discourse (Pollack 1986; DiEugenio 1993b; Balkanski 1994) has used a representation based on Goldman's <ref> (Goldman 1970) </ref> work in the philosophy of action. These approaches have been successful in accounting for text describing the relationships between two steps, but when viewed in the context of the plan in which those steps are embedded, their representation can be seen to lack specificity.

Reference-contexts: Grosz and Kraus <ref> (Grosz & Kraus 1993) </ref> relate Brat-man's notion of intention to a description of plans held by a group of collaborating agents. They distinguish between intending to do an action and intending that a condition hold in the world. Our definition of intentionality is consistent with theirs.

Reference-contexts: Finally, action representations must be capable of describing partial plans. Conversations about plans often occur in contexts where agents are collaborating about the construction of plan <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1990) </ref>. In these contexts they will interleave planning and communication about the plan. An action representation that can describe incomplete or incorrect nature of plans and the process used to correct or complete them is essential.
