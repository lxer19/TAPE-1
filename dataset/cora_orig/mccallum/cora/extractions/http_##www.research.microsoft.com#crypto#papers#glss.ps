Title: General Linear Secret Sharing (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Josh Benaloh

Abstract: Recent work by Ito, Saito, and Nishizeki and by Benaloh and Le-ichter have shown that it is possible to share a secret according to any monotone access structure. However, even if the access structure has a simple description, such a scheme may require that each shareholder be given a very large amount of information relative to the size of the secret. Yao has recently shown that, based on a cryptographic assumption, a secret can be shared according to any monotone access structure using space proportional to the size of any monotone circuit describing that access structure. Yao's technique, however, loses the information theoretic security properties of secret sharing and instead bases security on unproven assumptions. This paper introduces a new information theoretic technique of secret sharing which subsumes all previous information theoretic methods. Secrets can be shared efficiently according to any access structure which previously admitted efficient secret sharing. In addition, a large class of access structures for which no previous efficient secret sharing was known can be managed by this technique. While it is not hard to see that there are monotone access structures for which efficient, information theoretic secret sharing is impossible, it is not known whether this scheme is sufficient to efficiently implement any access structure for which an efficient scheme is possible.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the size of the shares can grow exponentially with the description of A. (Ideally, each shareholder would receive a share which is the same size as the secret.) In 1988, Benaloh and Leichter <ref> [BeLi88] </ref> introduced a method which simplified and extended the method of Ito, Saito, and Nishizeki. This new method allowed an access structure to be written as an arbitrary formula consisting of threshold operators (including and operators and or operators). <p> Example The monotone access structure given by f = (p 1 ^ p 2 ) _ (p 2 ^ p 3 ) _ (p 3 ^ p 4 ) can easily be shown to admit no ideal secret sharing scheme. (A proof of this is given in <ref> [BeLi88] </ref>.) However, the array A = B B B B fl fl 0 0 0 0 fl 0 fl 0 0 0 fl 0 fl 0 0 0 1 C C C A defines an ideal secret sharing scheme for the access structure H 6 (A) = (p 1 ^ p <p> The scheme of <ref> [BeLi88] </ref> precisely achieves a number of shares proportional to formula size, so the scheme described here can do all that the prior scheme can do (and more). 7 Theorem 2 Given an n input threshold formula f , an n fi n array A can be constructed such that H n

Reference-contexts: Yao used an arbitrary monotone circuit to describe the access structure and showed how to use one-way functions (assuming they exist) to achieve a secret sharing scheme in which the total size of the shares is proportional to the size of the circuit. Recently, Brickell and Davenport <ref> [BrDa90] </ref> gave a characterization of ideal information theoretic secret sharing schemes (those in which each participant holds a share of the same size as the secret) in terms of matroid representations.

Reference-contexts: Since A has full rank, any k 1 participants will have no information whatsoever about the value of s. Similar approaches to threshold schemes have been explored by Karnin, Green, and Hellman [KGH83] and by Kothari <ref> [Koth84] </ref>. We can, however, do much more than threshold schemes if we do not require A to have full rank.

Reference-contexts: Once again, the total size of the shares is proportional to the size of the formula. However, this broader class of formulae allows a larger class of access structures to be bases for efficient secret sharing. In 1989, Yao <ref> [Yao89] </ref> described a new approach which trades information theoretic security for greater efficiency.
