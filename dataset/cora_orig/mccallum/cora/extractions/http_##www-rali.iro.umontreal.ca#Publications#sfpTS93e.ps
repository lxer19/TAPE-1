Reference-contexts: One mode of access which is crucial to performance is the half of the Occurrence relation which maps a forms text to its list of token positions. By implementing this list as a B-tree (see <ref> [1] </ref>), we ensure rapid retrieval of the forms occurrences within any particular region of text. 4 The Search Mechanism Our bilingual concordance program is called TransSearch. This program uses a fairly traditional search algorithm to extract concordance subsets from a TransBase structure.

Reference-contexts: This is how a system like Trados Translators Workbench, given a new sentence to translate and having found that sentence or a similar one in its memory, can quickly retrieve a candidate translation for the translator, who may then retain it or modify it as he sees fit (cf <ref> [2] </ref>). Moreover, a translation memory has applications beyond the simple recovery of translated sentences: it can serve as the basis for a bilingual concordance tool, a program which finds occurrences of specified expressions or pairs of expressions, and displays them in their bilingual context.

Reference-contexts: It is very likely that such a concordance would be a valuable resource for lexicographers (cf <ref> [3] </ref>) and translators alike. When confronted with an idiomatic expression like out to lunch or a fixed formula like pitch a no-hitter, a translator will frequently hesitate over an appropriate translation; traditional resources, such as bilingual dictionaries, are often relatively impoverished in this regard.

Reference-contexts: This capacity requires finer correspondences than those on which Trans 18 Search in currently based. Algorithms for word-to-word correspondence exist (see, eg <ref> [4] </ref> and [8]), but remain to be evaluated and integrated into the system. Finally, while our translation memory structure resolves some problems for bilingual translators, it is not at present adapted for multilingual translations.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 illustrates an alignment for two paragraphs in which the segmentation units are sentences. The alignments in TransBase consist of sentence segments, and are produced by an algorithm based on that of Gale and Church <ref> [6] </ref>. For a given pair of texts, this algorithm considers all align ments which can be established using a fixed number of translation patterns for couples. <p> A detailed description of the algorithm and an analysis of its performance are given in [11].

Source: <ref> [6] </ref>. 8 3.2 Structure Conceptually, the TransBase structure can be seen as a database comprising six types of entities which can be organized into three components: a unilingual component for each language, made up of Token and Form entities; and a bilingual component, made up of Document and Couple entities.

Reference-contexts: In what follows we describe a bilingual concordance tool called TransSearch that has been conceived and developed by the machine assisted translation (TAO) group at CITI. This program is the first in a set of tools intended as aids to the professional translator (see <ref> [7] </ref>). 2 Bilingual Concordances Before tackling the subject of bilingual concordances, we need to briefly discuss ordinary (ie, uni-lingual) concordances.

Reference-contexts: A bilingual concordance tool permits the extraction from a translation memory of such expressions, along with different translations that have been used in the past. This idea is developed in greater detail by Macklovitch <ref> [10] </ref>. In what follows we describe a bilingual concordance tool called TransSearch that has been conceived and developed by the machine assisted translation (TAO) group at CITI.

Reference-contexts: It is also quite efficient, and is capable of aligning more than 80,000 words in each language per minute on a SPARCstation 1+.
