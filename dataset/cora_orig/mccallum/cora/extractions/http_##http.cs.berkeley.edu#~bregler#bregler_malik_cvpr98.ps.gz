Abstract: This paper demonstrates a new visual motion estimation technique that is able to recover high degree-of-freedom articulated human body configurations in complex video sequences. We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Euler angles are commonly used to constrain the rotation matrix to SO (3), but they suffer from singularities and don't lead to a simple formulation in the optimization procedure (for example <ref> [2] </ref> propose a 3D ellipsoidal tracker based on Euler angles). In contrast, the twist representation provides a more elegant solution [20] and leads to a very simple linear representation of the motion model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The estimation of image motion without any domain constraints is an underconstrained problem. Therefore all proposed motion estimation algorithms involve additional constraints about the assumed motion structure. One class of motion estimation techniques are based on parametric algorithms <ref> [3] </ref>. These techniques rely pm solving a highly overconstrained system of linear equations. For example, if an image patch could be modeled as a planar surface, an affine motion model with low degrees of freedom (6 DOF) can be estimated. <p> Section 2 introduces the new motion tracking framework and its mathematical formulation, section 3 details our experiments, and we discuss the results and future directions in section 4. 2 Motion Estimation We first describe a commonly used region-based motion estimation framework <ref> [3, 25] </ref>, and then describe the extension to kinematic chain constraints [20]. 2.1 Preliminaries Assuming that changes in image intensity are only due to translation of local image intensity, a parametric image motion between consecutive time frames t and t + 1 can be described by the following equation: I (x <p> For the case that the motion model is linear (as in the affine case), we can write the set of equations in matrix form (see <ref> [3] </ref> for details): H + ~z = ~ 0 (4) where H 2 &lt; NfiK , and ~z 2 &lt; N .

Reference-contexts: Such a support map usually covers a larger region, including pixels from the environment. That distracts the exact motion measurement. Robust statistics would be one solution to this problem <ref> [4] </ref>. Another solution is an EM-based layered representation [12, 15]. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe this method in detail, but we would like to outline the method briefly: We start with an initial guess of the support map (ellipsoidal projection in this case).

Reference-contexts: This can be done using additional constraints. Body segments don't move independently; they are attached by body joints. This reduces the number of free parameters dramatically. A convenient way of describing these additional domain constraints is the twist and product of exponential map formalism for kinematic chains <ref> [20] </ref>. The motion of one body segment can be described as the motion of the previous segment in a kinematic chain and an angular motion around a body joint.
