Abstract: We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.

Reference-contexts: Like this work, Dixon's work attempts to formally model the assumptions a system makes about its environment. Dixon's interest, however, is on what an individual program means rather than on comparing competing programs. 6. Toast Toast <ref> (Agre & Horswill, 1992) </ref> is a program that simulates a short-order cook in a reasonably detailed simulation of a kitchen (see Figure 3). In Toast, the world consists of a set of objects such as ovens, pans, cutting boards, globs of pancake batter, individual eggs, and customers of the restaurant.

Reference-contexts: Environments, Policies, and Reducibility In this section, we will introduce our formalism. The purpose of the formalism is not directly to specify the workings of the agent's cognitive machinery. Instead, its purpose is to construct "principled characterizations of interactions between agents and their environments to guide explanation and design" <ref> (Agre, 1995) </ref>. The formalism, in other words, describes an agent's embodied activities in a particular environment. Having characterized the dy 118 Lifeworld Analysis namics of those activities, it becomes possible to design suitable machinery.

Reference-contexts: It is often advantageous to record state in the world, whether in the relative locations of things and the persistent states (in the count noun sense) that they are left in <ref> (Beach, 1988) </ref>. For example, one need not remember whether the eggs have been broken if that fact is readily perceptible, if one's attention will be drawn to it on a suitable occasion, and if one understands its significance for the task.

Reference-contexts: Having characterized the dy 118 Lifeworld Analysis namics of those activities, it becomes possible to design suitable machinery. As a matter of principle, we want to design the simplest possible machinery that is consistent with a given pattern of interaction <ref> (Horswill, 1995) </ref>. We therefore make no a priori commitments about machinery. We do not favor any particular architecture until a particular activity has been analyzed. Nor do we make any a priori commitments about matters such as analog versus digital, "planning" versus "reaction," and so on. <p> In this paper, the states will only include facts about the physical environment, but it is a straightfor ward matter to include an agent's internal states as well <ref> (Horswill, 1995) </ref>. <p> It requires a fair amount of additional machinery, however, including the addition of state to the agent. Since simple reduction will suffice for our purposes, we will simply assert the following lemma, which is a direct consequence of the more general reduction lemma <ref> (Horswill, 1995) </ref>: Lemma 3 Let be a simple reduction from E 0 to some environment E and let (E 0 ; G 0 ) be a DCP.

Reference-contexts: He then empirically classified environments by the the minimal parameters that still allowed an optimal control policy to be learned. There is also an extensive literature on discrete-event dynamic systems <ref> (Kosecka, 1992) </ref>, which also model the environment as a finite state machine, but which assume that transition information (rather than state information) is visible to the agents. An alternative to the state-machine formalism can be found in the work of Dixon (1991).

Reference-contexts: The lifeworld of a child, for example, differs from that of an adult who can reach up to the cookie jar and into the locked cupboard where the roach spray is kept. A growing literature has investigated the processes of cognitive apprenticeship (Ro-goff, 1990), situated learning <ref> (Lave & Wenger, 1991) </ref>, distributed cognition (Hutchins, 1995; Salomon, 1993), and shared construction of activities (Griffin & Cole, 1989) that go on in these systematically restrictive and supportive lifeworlds. 140 Lifeworld Analysis 11.
