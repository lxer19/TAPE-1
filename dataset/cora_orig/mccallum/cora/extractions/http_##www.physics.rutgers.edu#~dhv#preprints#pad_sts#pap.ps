Abstract: We present first-principles total-energy calculations of (001) surfaces of SrTiO 3 . Both SrO-terminated and TiO 2 -terminated surfaces are considered, and the results are compared with previous calculations for BaTiO 3 surfaces. The major differences are in the details of the relaxed surface structures. Our calculations argue against the existence of a large ferroelectric relaxation in the surface layer, as had been previously proposed. We do find some indications of a weak surface ferroelectric instability, but so weak as to be easily destroyed by thermal fluctuations except perhaps at quite low temperatures. We also compute surface relaxation energies and surface electronic band structures, obtaining results that are generally similar to those for BaTiO 3 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The cubic perovskites are an important class of materials that are of particular interest because of the variety of structural phase transitions that they display <ref> [1] </ref>. The structural instabilities may be of ferroelectric (FE) character, as for BaTiO 3 , or of antiferrodistortive character (involving rotation of oxygen octahedra), as for SrTiO 3 .

Reference-contexts: The (001) and (111) surfaces of cubic perovskites have been most investigated experimentally <ref> [2] </ref>. For a II-IV perovskite such as SrTiO 3 , there are two possible nonpolar (001) surface terminations: a SrO-terminated surface (type-I), and a TiO 2 -terminated surface (type-II). On the other hand, the (111) surfaces are polar, and therefore presumably much less stable.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the (111) surfaces are polar, and therefore presumably much less stable. Here we focus on the (001) surfaces of SrTiO 3 . Interest in the surface properties of SrTiO 3 arises because of the catalytic properties of these surfaces <ref> [3] </ref>, and because of the common use of SrTiO 3 as a substrate for epitaxial growth of high-T c superconductors (such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ) [4] and other oxides. Preprint submitted to Surface Science 18 February 1998 Theoretical studies of these surface have been numerous.

In contrast, photoelectron spectroscopy [22] and scanning tunneling microscopy [23] observations show different reconstructions for the reduced surfaces. The absence of in-gap surface states has also been shown [6]. 2 Theoretical approach As in previous work on BaTiO 3 surfaces <ref> [13] </ref>, we employ here a self-consistent pseudopoten-tial technique in which the valence electron wavefunctions are obtained by minimizing the Kohn-Sham total-energy functional using a conjugate-gradient technique [24]. The exchange-correlation potential is treated within the local-density approximation (LDA) in the Ceperley-Alder form [25]. <p> Units are at the theoretical lattice constant (a = 3:86 A). Layer SrO Surface ffiz TiO 2 Surface ffiz 1 Sr -0.057 Ti -0.034 2 Ti 0.012 Sr 0.025 3 Sr -0.012 Ti -0.007 method and its accuracy, we direct the reader to our earlier paper <ref> [13] </ref>. Below 105K, SrTiO 3 transforms to a tetragonal antiferrodistortive (AFD) state in which the oxygen octahedra rotate about a h001i axis in opposite directions in alternate unit cells [28]. However, these rotations are typically small; even at T = 0 they amount to only ~ 3 ffi . <p> Dashed and solid lines correspond to type-I (SrO-terminated) and type-II (TiO 2 -terminated) surfaces respectively. 5 Surface energies We discuss next the surface energetics. To compare energies of surfaces having different stoichiometry, we follow the approach described in Ref. <ref> [13] </ref>. That is, we consider each surface slab to be built from TiO 2 and SrO units, and compute the grand thermodynamic potential F for each type of surface as a function of the TiO 2 chemical potential TiO 2 . <p> Not surprisingly, our results for the band structures of the surfaces of SrTiO 3 are very similar to the case of BaTiO 3 surfaces <ref> [13] </ref>. The computed LDA electronic energy band structure is given in Fig. 2 and the direct energy gaps are given in Table 3. We see that the band gap for the SrO surface almost does not change with respect to the bulk value, and no in-gap state occurs. <p> For the TiO 2 surface, there is a substantial reduction of the band gap. However, there are no deep-gap surface states, in accord with experimental reports [6]. From Fig. 2 (c), we see (as is also true for BaTiO 3 ) <ref> [13] </ref> that there is a tendency for valence-band states to intrude upwards into the lower part of the band gap for this surface, especially near the M point of the surface Brillouin Zone, that is the top of the valence band. <p> Slab Band gap Slab I 1.86 Slab II 1.13 Bulk 1.85 at this state was obtained. The results are very similar to those shown in Fig. 4 of Ref. <ref> [13] </ref> for the case of BaTiO 3 .

Such a cutoff has previously been shown to be adequate in the bulk [24].

Reference-contexts: The main difference between that report and the present work is that we fully relax the atomic coordinates in the slab. Also, we analyze the possible existence of a FE surface layer for the SrO surface <ref> [18] </ref>, as has been suggested previously. On the experimental side, the study of these surfaces is complicated by the presence of surface defects [19], making it difficult to verify the surface stoichiometry. The results also tend to depend upon the surface treatment [20]. <p> On the other hand, we do want to consider the possible presence of a FE surface layer, as suggest in Ref. <ref> [18] </ref>. We thus choose symmetries as follows. <p> In fact, the presence of just this kind of FE monolayer at the surface has been predicted by Ravikumar, Wolf and Dravid <ref> [18] </ref> for the SrO termination of SrTiO 3 . However, this prediction is based on an empirical interatomic potential developed for ionic systems, and it is not clear how far such a pair-potential approach can be trusted for deciding such a delicate question as the appearance of surface FE order. <p> much smaller than the one predicted by Ravikumar et al.<ref> [18] </ref>. We actually find a somewhat larger tendency for FE distortion for the TiO 2 surface, but still the distortion amplitudes (maximum 0.07 A) and energy (0.013 eV/surface) are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the SrO-surface prediction of Ref. [18]. Our predicted FE distortion is small enough that it may easily be destroyed by thermal (or even quantum) fluctuations, and it seems unlikely that it would appear at room temperature. <p> Our calculations do not support the existence of a large FE distortion in the surface layer of the Sr-terminated surface, as had been previously proposed theoretically <ref> [18] </ref>. While we cannot rule out a weak FE surface instability, especially for the Ti-terminated surface, our results indicate that it would be sufficiently weak so as to be easily destroyed by thermal fluctuations except at quite low temperatures.

From Table 1, we can see that the largest relaxations are for the metal atoms in the surface layer, -5.7% and -3.4% for the Sr-terminated and Ti-terminated surfaces respectively. <p> The outward relaxation of the second-layer Sr atom on the Ti-terminated surface is also noteworthy. The surface-layer oxygen atoms show almost no displacement on the Sr-terminated surface. Previous surface structural refinements have been carried out by Bickel et al. [21] and by Hikita, Hanada and Kudo <ref> [20] </ref> using (LEED) and (RHEED), respectively.

While this was argued to be "acceptable in view of the complexity of the structure," it nevertheless seems uncomfortably large. In the work of Hikita et al., <ref> [20] </ref> the surface was prepared in different conditions in order to obtain SrO and TiO 2 terminations separately; for these, R-factors of 0.28 and 0.26 were obtained, respectively. <p> By minimizing the Hellmann-Feynman forces on the atoms, we obtained the optimal ionic positions.

Previous surface structural refinements have been carried out by Bickel et al. <ref> [21] </ref> and by Hikita, Hanada and Kudo [20] using (LEED) and (RHEED), respectively. In Table 2, we compare our structural parameters with the two experimental ones. <p> Both experimental groups assumed that the oxygen and metal atoms remain coplanar in the second and third layers in order to simplify the refinement procedure; since the scattering strength of O is much smaller than that of Sr and Ti <ref> [21] </ref>, our theoretical comparison is made to the position of the subsurface metal layers. Thus, we define d 12 as the change (relative to bulk) of the first interlayer spacing, as measured from the surface to the subsurface metal z coordinate, and similarly for d 23 . <p> However, we predict a substantial contraction of the interlayer spacing d 12 , while in most cases 4 the experimental refinement indicates an expansion instead. The one exception is for the Sr--terminated surface, where our theory is in reasonable agreement with Ref. <ref> [21] </ref>, although not with Ref. [20]. The agreement for the second interlayer spacing can be seen to be mixed. The disagreement between the two sets of experimental numbers [30] suggests that the experimental refinements should perhaps not be taken too seriously. <p> The expected quality of a LEED or RHEED refinement is not well established for a complicated metal oxide surface such as this one. In the work of Bickel et al., <ref> [21] </ref> the authors were not able to determine independently the proportions of the surface exhibiting the SrO and TiO 2 terminations; they assumed that the two appear in equal proportions. Refining the structural parameters for both simultaneously, they then obtained an R-factor of 0.53. <p> While this would thus appear to be the more reliable experiment, unfortunately it is in no better agreement with the theory than the refinement of Ref. <ref> [21] </ref>. One possible problem with both experimental refinements could be the arbitrary assumption that there is no buckling in the second metal-oxygen plane. Our results indicate that there is a substantial buckling in that layer, especially in the case of the subsurface SrO layer on the TiO 2 -terminated surface. <p> Thus, we have undertaken to check whether such a FE surface phase might occur in the context of our ab-initio calculations. Note that while Bickel et al. have discussed the rumpling of the surface layer in terms of 5 a "ferroelectric relaxation" normal to the surface <ref> [21] </ref>, such a rumpling does not break any symmetry of the ideal surface, and is not qualitatively different from the rumpling observed on other oxide surfaces. Thus, when we speak of a FE surface layer, we shall restrict ourselves here to symmetry-breaking distortions, i.e., frozen-in displacements parallel to the surface. <p> By minimizing the Hellmann-Feynman forces on the atoms, we obtained the optimal ionic positions. Previous experimental LEED <ref> [21] </ref> and RHEED [20] surface structure determinations are found to be significantly at variance with our predictions, as well as with each other. Our calculations do not support the existence of a large FE distortion in the surface layer of the Sr-terminated surface, as had been previously proposed theoretically [18].

Then we allow this structure to relax fully. We did these simulations for both kinds of termination, and for both theoretical and experimental lattice constants. For the case of experimental lattice constant, the resulting relaxed displacements along the ^x direction, in units of lattice constant, are as follows.

However, these rotations are typically small; even at T = 0 they amount to only ~ 3 ffi .

The layer numbering in Table 1 is from the outermost layer inwards. <p> Our results indicate that there is a substantial buckling in that layer, especially in the case of the subsurface SrO layer on the TiO 2 -terminated surface. Also included in Table 2 are theoretical estimates of Mackrodt <ref> [29] </ref> using an interatomic potential based on Kim-Gordon pair potentials. This theory gives results that are qualitatively similar to ours, although the pair-potential model appears to overestimate the size of the inter-layer relaxations and underestimate the degree of surface rumpling.
Reference: [30] <editor> While a statement appears in Ref. </editor> <title> [20] to the effect that their results are "basically consistent" with those of Ref. [21], this statement is not supported by a direct comparison of the two sets of results, as in Table 2. </title>
Reference-contexts: It is evident that the agreement between the theory and the experimental refinements is not very good. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the experimental structures are in poor agreement with each other <ref> [30] </ref>. Our values for the rumpling s of the surface layer are in rough qualitative agreement with the experimental ones, though somewhat larger in magnitude. However, we predict a substantial contraction of the interlayer spacing d 12 , while in most cases 4 the experimental refinement indicates an expansion instead. <p> The one exception is for the Sr--terminated surface, where our theory is in reasonable agreement with Ref. [21], although not with Ref. [20]. The agreement for the second interlayer spacing can be seen to be mixed. The disagreement between the two sets of experimental numbers <ref> [30] </ref> suggests that the experimental refinements should perhaps not be taken too seriously. The expected quality of a LEED or RHEED refinement is not well established for a complicated metal oxide surface such as this one.

Reference-contexts: SrO layer of the TiO 2 -terminated surface, similar to what we reported above in Table 1. 4 Testing for a ferroelectric monolayer Bulk SrTiO 3 is an incipient ferroelectric: it nearly becomes ferroelectric at very low temperature, and is apparently prevented from doing so only by quantum zero-point fluctuations <ref> [31] </ref>. In our work on surfaces of FE BaTiO 3 , we found some tendency for an enhancement of the FE order in the first few surface layers, especially for the case of the TiO 2 termination.
