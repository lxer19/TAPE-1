Abstract: We report progress in the development of a measure of speaking rate that is computed from the acoustic signal. The newest form of our analysis incorporates multiple estimates of rate; besides the spectral moment for a full-band energy envelope that we have previously reported, we also used pointwise correlation between pairs of compressed sub-band energy envelopes. The complete measure, called mrate, has been compared to a reference syllable rate derived from a manually transcribed subset of the Switchboard database. The correlation with transcribed syllable rate is significantly higher than our earlier measure; estimates are typically within 1-2 syllables/second of the reference syllable rate. We conclude by assessing the use of mrate as a detector for rapid speech.

Reference-contexts: Mrate incorporates multiple estimators, a technique that has been shown to be beneficial for many aspects of speech analysis, such as the parallel pitch detection approach developed by Gold and Rabiner 30 years ago <ref> [1] </ref>. As in that case, using multiple estimators significantly improves the error variance. 2. SIGNAL PROCESSING METHODS As noted above, we have previously used enrate as a measure of speaking rate [5].

Reference-contexts: Estimation is typically done over 1-2 seconds; for the experiments reported here, we used between-pause intervals, which varied from .25 to 6 seconds, but which were most typically between .5 and 2 seconds. Switchboard Transcription Project at ICSI <ref> [2] </ref>; the transcriptions consisted of phonetic identities with syllabic boundary markings, as phonetic boundaries were often difficult to determine in this conversational speech context. Utterances were segmented into spurt regions using the transcribers' pause markings, providing 7994 regions for analysis.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, we have also worked to develop a measure of speaking rate that is only dependent on the acoustic signal. We previously reported in [5] an estimator called enrate, which was essentially the first spectral moment of the broad-band energy envelope. Kitazawa <ref> [3] </ref> also reported a full-band measure that was very similar (taking the dominant spectral peak of the long term envelope spectrum, rather than the moment). Enrate was correlated with transcribed syllabic rate, but the deviations were large.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We and others have been looking at the effects of speaking rate in continuous speech for several years, as reported in e.g., [6], <ref> [4] </ref>. We have found that there are strong measurable effects on acoustic distributions and on durations. We have also begun to explore effects on pronunciation; for some words, pronunciation probabilities can change significantly due to rate, e.g. for the monosyllabic word shown in Table 1. <p> Of course, syllabic transcriptions are not accessible during the operation of a speech recognition system, so it is necessary to design a measure that can be computed without a transcription of what was said. In <ref> [4] </ref> we described the tactic of running the recognizer twice, using the first pass to hypothesize sound unit boundaries and hence the speaking rate, which would then be incorporated in a second pass; when the rate was only going to be classified as fast or not fast this could also be

Reference-contexts: The threshold between high and low was the median syllable rate for the between-pause spurt containing each target syllable, and was computed from manual transcriptions. Consequently, we have also worked to develop a measure of speaking rate that is only dependent on the acoustic signal. We previously reported in <ref> [5] </ref> an estimator called enrate, which was essentially the first spectral moment of the broad-band energy envelope. Kitazawa [3] also reported a full-band measure that was very similar (taking the dominant spectral peak of the long term envelope spectrum, rather than the moment). <p> As in that case, using multiple estimators significantly improves the error variance. 2. SIGNAL PROCESSING METHODS As noted above, we have previously used enrate as a measure of speaking rate <ref> [5] </ref>. Enrate is the first spectral moment of the wideband energy envelope, typically computed over 1-2 seconds and restricted to roughly the spectral range from 1 to 16 Hz.
