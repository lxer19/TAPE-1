Title: respond to variations of the intensity, frequency, duration and spectrum of a sound. In general,
Note: Chapter 15 PSYCHOACOUSTICS 15.1 Introduction All, all and tall is rather poetic. Was that intended? People  281  
Abstract: Psychoacoustics is the science whereby we can quantify the human perception of sounds. The ultimate aim is to derive a quantitative model that matches all the results of all auditory experiments that we can contrive. This is quite a tall order, since, to a great extent, the human auditory system remains a "black box", despite many years of glorious physiological research efforts. In this chapter we will survey some of the more important results and, where possible, to correlate psychophysical phenomena with physiological measurements. (We will be using the terms "psychophysics" and "psychoacoustics" interchangeably.) As we proceed, we will italicize certain terms that apply more or less specifically to psychoacoustic terminology. As in the previous chapter on auditory physiology, comprehension of the terms used is a good part of the battle in learning the material. proportional to the stimulus. Thus, if a person hears a pure tone at some given frequency f , followed by another tone at 2f , the response will not be that the frequency of the second tone is double that of the first tone. Similarly, if the intensity of the tone is doubled, the human subject will not describe it as twice as loud. The same argument holds for perception of

Many experiments have certainly verified (at least approximately) this law and have ***** Experiments have verified the law for all sensations or just hearing? ***** led to the use of the decibel scale.

MASKING 287 These curves, variations on the earlier work of Fletcher and Munson <ref> [2] </ref>, are accepted as standard by the International Standards Organization. Each curve denotes the measurement of equal loudness as a function of tone frequency. We see from these curves that the ear is most sensitive to sound of about 5kHz.

Reference-contexts: Critical Bands by Masking: As discussed in the previous chapter, auditory neurons are "tuned" to specific characteristic frequencies. Thus, we surmise that the auditory system behaves like some sort of a filter bank. Critical band experiments are designed to attach numerical values to the "filters" in the bank. Fletcher <ref> [3] </ref> did some of the early experiments to determine the ***** One of my reviewers objected to prosaic words like "did." ***** properties of these auditory filters. He based his measurements on the ear's response to a pure tone in band-limited white noise.

Reference-contexts: In the following sections we will review some of the classic experiments that have been performed to try to answer these types of questions. Our approach will depend greatly on the use of a compact disc, Auditory Demonstrations [5]. A review paper by Hartmann <ref> [4] </ref> contains evaluations based on class listenings.

Second, the results may be affected by room reverberations. The reader is invited to read some interesting papers on these types of experiments; here, we will reproduce Fig.7 from <ref> [4] </ref> as our Fig.15.7. The figure plots a histogram of the number of listeners who heard n more pulse stream signals with the 2000 Hz masker than with the 1200 Hz masker. The target tone decreases in 10 steps of 5 dB each, except for the first step, 15.5.

Reference-contexts: Demonstration 7. Loudness Scaling Notice that the phon is an objective measure. To define a subjective measure of loudness we introduce the sone, the loudness when the stimulus is 40 phons. Based on the work of Stevens <ref> [6] </ref> and others, an empirical relation between the sound pressure p and the loudness S in sones gives the result S = Cp 0:6 (15.2) which allows us to estimate that the loudness roughly doubles for every 10db. increase in sound pressure.
