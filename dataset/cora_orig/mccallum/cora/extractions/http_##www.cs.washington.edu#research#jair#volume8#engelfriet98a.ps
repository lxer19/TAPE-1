Abstract: An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmono-tonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.

Reference-contexts: The first is a variant of Lyndon's theorem and is folklore (we leave the details to the reader); the second result is known as the Los-Tarski theorem <ref> (Chang & Keisler, 1990, Theorem 3.2.2) </ref>. Theorem 20 1. A first-order predicate formula ' is downward persistent in predicate circumscription (of P ) if and only if it is equivalent to a formula that is negative in P . 2.

Reference-contexts: We assume a standard first-order language L with a finite number of predicate symbols, including equality. We will also assume that the language contains no function or constant symbols. This is not a severe limitation, since we can eliminate function and constant symbols by introducing new predicate symbols <ref> (Davis, 1980) </ref>. We will first give the definition of the orderings and then define predicate and domain circumscriptive consequence. Definition 12 1. Let P be a predicate symbol in the language L.

Reference-contexts: Their aim was to formalize statements of the form "I only know '". It allows, for example, to derive that an agent which only knows p, does not know q. Ground S5 falls into the general scheme of ground nonmonotonic modal logics <ref> (Donini, Nardi, & Rosati, 1997) </ref>. A lot of interest is devoted to logics of minimal knowledge (Levesque, 1990; Schwarz & Truszczynski, 1994; Chen, 1997; Halpern, 1997). Semantically, states in which an agent only knows ', are states in which ' is known, but otherwise the amount of knowledge is minimal. <p> Syntactic characterizations of persistent formulae were given for a number of example preferential logics, but we would like to have a result for broader classes of preferential logics, such as the class of ground nonmonotonic modal logics <ref> (Donini et al., 1997) </ref>. Acknowledgements I would like to thank Riccardo Rosati for stimulating discussions and worthwhile suggestions.

Reference-contexts: Formulae from DIAM essentially only contain the M operator (the `diamond' of S5, and not the `box' operator K). Formulae in this class are the only subjective formulae (up to equivalence) which are downward persistent in Ground S5 <ref> (this was proved by Engelfriet, 1996a) </ref>. Theorem 16 A subjective S5 formula ' is downward persistent in Ground S5 if and only if it is S5-equivalent to a formula in DIAM. So in Ground S5 there is a non-empty class of downward persistent formulae, that respect monotonicity by Proposition 14. <p> For instance, it can be important how much information is retained from previous queries: whether proofs or minimal models are stored. Let us consider the examples again. Preferential entailment in both Ground S5 and MTEL is Q P 3 -complete <ref> (Engelfriet, 1996a) </ref>, whereas full circumscription is undecidable (restricted versions of circumscription exist which are decidable, but still highly complex). Unfortunately, determining downward or upward persistence is not easier for these logics.

It is one of the basic properties in the framework of Kraus et al. (1990).

Reference-contexts: Proof: Consider the first-order language L = f&lt;; =g, and let ' be a sentence stating that &lt; is a dense linear ordering without begin- or endpoint. This is a complete theory <ref> (Rabin, 1977, Theorem 4) </ref>, which means that for any ff 2 L, either ' j= ff or ' j= :ff. Now suppose ff j= DC fi. If ' j= :ff then ff ^ ' is inconsistent, so ff ^ ' j= DC fi trivially.

Reference-contexts: Whether such classes exist, and what these classes are, depends of course on the particular nonmonotonic logic considered. We will focus here on an important class of nonmonotonic logics: the class of preferential logics <ref> (Shoham, 1987, 1988) </ref>. These logics are based on a monotonic logic (such as propositional logic, predicate logic or modal logic) augmented with a preference order on its models.
