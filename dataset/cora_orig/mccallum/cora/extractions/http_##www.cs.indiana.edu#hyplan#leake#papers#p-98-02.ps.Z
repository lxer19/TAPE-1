Title: Integrating CBR components within a Case-Based Planner

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning systems can improve the effectiveness of reasoning by integrating multiple reasoning methods, each selectively applied to the tasks for which it is best-suited. One integration approach is to bring CBR into other systems, by developing case-based intelligent components (Riesbeck 1996) that collaborate with other reasoning systems, monitoring their successes and failures and suggesting solutions when prior experiences are relevant. Another approach is to bring other reasoning processes into a CBR system's own architecture, to facilitate subprocesses of CBR such as case adaptation and similarity assessment. This paper describes a project combining both approaches: It discusses motivations and methods for a case-based components approach to integrating multiple reasoning modes, styles, and levels within a case-based reasoning system. The fundamental principle is for the system to use case-based components to learn by monitoring, capturing, and exploiting traces of multiple types of prior reasoning within the CBR system. The paper considers the benefits of this approach for improving CBR and its potential applicability to integrations in other contexts.

Reference-contexts: DIAL's use of internal derivations CBR is most in the spirit of Oehlmann's metacognitive adaptation (Oehlmann 1995). DIAL's use of CBR for memory search to build up memory search information usable by case-based adaptation can also be seen as a type of multilayer CBR <ref> (Grimnes & Aamodt 1996) </ref>. Our approach also differs from other projects in emphasizing the ongoing integration of case-based and rule-base processing. Rather than simply falling back on rule-based reasoning when no case is available, its case-based and rule-based reasoning can provide each other with information as needed during processing.

Reference-contexts: Rather than focusing on multimodal reasoning at the domain level, the focus of our research is on multimodal internal reasoning. Early CBR research proposed internal CBR to guide adaptation (Sycara 1988); recent projects have examined the use of learning processes to improve adaptation knowledge <ref> (Hanney & Keane 1996) </ref> and similarity criteria (Ricci & Avesani 1995; Veloso 1994). DIAL's use of internal derivations CBR is most in the spirit of Oehlmann's metacognitive adaptation (Oehlmann 1995).

Reference-contexts: Based on experience with this system we make a more general claim: that using CBR components to monitor, capture, and replay a system's reasoning processes is a promising approach to guiding those processes and augmenting their capabilities. Task and Methods Our testbed system, DIAL <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1996) </ref>, is a case-based planning system. DIAL's domain is disaster response planning, the initial high-level planning involved in deciding, for example, the basic outline for a plan to rescue and relocate the victims of a flood or earthquake.

Reference-contexts: We are now gathering quantitative data on the benefits of this multimodal processing. An initial set of ablation studies of the contributions of different combinations of reasoning methods|no learning, domain-level CBR and RBR alone, adaptation CBR alone, and the combination|is described in <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1997a) </ref>. In these tests, the overall processing speed of the combined system is superior to that of the "standard" CBR system on which it is based, as is the range of problems the system can solve.

Reference-contexts: When this case is reused, it may also be extended by rule-based reasoning to fit new needs. Our model of how this is carried out emphasizes the use of domain-independent strategies, with the aim of facilitating transfer of the approach to other task domains <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wil-son 1997b) </ref>. Integrations for Similarity Assessment Learned adaptation cases provide the knowledge needed for another rule-based/case-based internal reasoning process, similarity assessment. As has been pointed out by a number of researchers, useful similarity judgments must reflect "adaptability" (Smyth & Keane 1996).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Case-based reasoning provides opportunities for integrations both with other reasoning processes and within the CBR process itself. Case-based reasoning intelligent components <ref> (Riesbeck 1996) </ref>, integrated with other reasoning systems, can augment those systems by monitoring their processing and learning from their successes and failures to increase the speed or quality of reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Integrations for Similarity Assessment Learned adaptation cases provide the knowledge needed for another rule-based/case-based internal reasoning process, similarity assessment. As has been pointed out by a number of researchers, useful similarity judgments must reflect "adaptability" <ref> (Smyth & Keane 1996) </ref>. Because DIAL's rule-based case adaptation is augmented with case-based adaptation, the adaptability of cases changes with adaptation learning|so similarity judgments must change as well. DIAL initially selects a disaster response case to apply using rule-based similarity assessment, according to pre-defined domain-specific criteria.
