Reference-contexts: Thus Hout's (1988) iterative model search guided by BIC led to a model that fits better than others, and is parsimonious, with each parameter being substantively interpretable. The parameter estimates <ref> (Table 5 of Hout, 1988) </ref> showed clearly how the associations between origins and destinations changed between 1972 and 1985.

Reference-contexts: Given the sample design, it is hard to see what the source of substantial overdispersion would be. In any event, if overdispersion were explicitly taken into account using standard methods <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>, the deviances would be deflated and the evidence for the more parsimonious models would be stronger. Among the models considered here, the choices made would be unaffected. 32 deviance) could be more parsimoniously and interpretably represented.

Reference-contexts: Thus it is most natural to use BIC rather than BIC 0 . What should n be? Once again, it is best to use the actual number of individuals, i.e. the sum of the cell counts, and not the number of cells <ref> (Raftery, 1986a) </ref>. 4.2.5 Event history analysis Most event history analysis software reports the LRT statistic against the null model with no independent variables, and so BIC 0 is the more convenient measure to use.

Reference-contexts: The latter question can be answered by calculating the posterior odds for M 0 against M 1 . <ref> (Raftery, 1986b) </ref>. The second reason relates to the nature of the conditioning in the two procedures. A standard test rejects H 0 if equation (1) holds, i.e. if the probability under H 0 of observing a value of the test statistic as extreme or more so is small. <p> This was the original example of BIC for log-linear models <ref> (Raftery, 1986b) </ref>. The fifth model in Table 2 is discussed below in Section 7. 6.2 Many Candidate Independent Variables It was shown in Section 2.3 that when there are many candidate independent variables, statistical conclusions based on the selected model can be very misleading.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the O (1) error does suggest the approximation to be somewhat crude. Empirical experience has found (16) to be more accurate in practice than the O (1) error term would suggest <ref> (e.g. Raftery, 1993b) </ref>. In fact, the error is of a much smaller order of magnitude for a particular, reasonable, choice of prior distribution. Suppose that the prior p () is multivariate normal with mean ^ and variance matrix i 1 .

It seems best to use the number of events rather than either of the other two possibilities <ref> (Raftery, Madigan and Volinsky, 1995) </ref>. For discrete time event history analysis, the same choice has been made (Xie, 1994), while the total number of exposure time units has also been used, for consistency with logistic regression (Raftery, Lewis, Aghajanian and Kahn, 1993; Raftery, Lewis and Aghajanian, 1994). <p> Formally speaking, this worry is unfounded, given that one ever considers only M 1 and M 2 .
