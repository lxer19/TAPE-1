Title: Two Heuristics for the Euclidean Steiner Tree Problem  
Author: Derek R. Dreyer Michael L. Overton 
Date: June 11, 1997  
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner tree problem is to find the tree with minimal Euclidean length spanning a set of fixed points in the plane, allowing the addition of auxiliary points to the set (Steiner points). The problem is NP-hard, so polynomial-time heuristics are desired. We present two such heuristics, both of which utilize an efficient method for computing a locally optimal tree with a given topology. The first systematically inserts Steiner points between edges of the minimal spanning tree meeting at angles less than 120 degrees, performing a local optimization at the end. The second begins by finding the Steiner tree for three of the fixed points. Then, at each iteration, it introduces a new fixed point to the tree, connecting it to each possible edge by inserting a Steiner point, and minimizes over all connections, performing a local optimization for each. We present a variety of test cases that demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of both algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This method was easily appli-cable to the Steiner tree problem and worked quite well. Currently, however, we are working with a similarly aimed, but considerably faster, code written in C by Knud Andersen <ref> [AA96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, it should be noted that, whereas the SI tree was computed in a matter of seconds, the IO heuristic took over three hours. Our third test is the well-known "ladder" test of Chung and Graham with n = 10 <ref> [CG78] </ref>, and its exact Steiner tree is displayed in Figure 7. The results of our heuristics are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. While SI scores an expected 3.0% improvement over the minimal spanning tree, IO does quite well, with 5.2%.

Reference-contexts: Originally, we used a primal-dual interior point method for minimizing a sum of Euclidean vector norms as described by Conn and 2 3 Overton in <ref> [CO94] </ref> and written in MATLAB. This method was easily appli-cable to the Steiner tree problem and worked quite well. Currently, however, we are working with a similarly aimed, but considerably faster, code written in C by Knud Andersen [AA96].

Reference-contexts: These auxiliary points are called Steiner points and there need be at most n 2 of them [GP68]. Because of the ability to add Steiner points to the original graph, the Steiner tree problem is NP-hard <ref> [GGJ77] </ref>, and thus good heuristics are perhaps the best hope. An important aspect of Steiner trees is that the edges connected to the Steiner points all intersect at angles of 120 degrees.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there is a theorem that states that "no two edges of a Steiner tree can meet at an angle less than 120 degrees" and "each Steiner point of a Steiner tree is of degree exactly three" <ref> [HRW92] </ref>. These facts are essential to an understanding of the problem and formed the basis for one of the heuristics we have developed. The simplest example and one which occurs quite frequently inside larger problems is the 3-point case as seen in Figure 1, also known as the Fermat problem. <p> The simplest example and one which occurs quite frequently inside larger problems is the 3-point case as seen in Figure 1, also known as the Fermat problem.

Figure 2 shows another elementary example consisting of 4 points forming a rectangle with sides 1 and 1.3.

The "Heuristics" chapter of this book contains many suggestions for possible heuristics, one of which we actually used for our Steiner insertion algorithm.
