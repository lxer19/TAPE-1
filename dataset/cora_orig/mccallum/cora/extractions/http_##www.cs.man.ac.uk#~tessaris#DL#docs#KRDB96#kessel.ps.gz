Abstract: This paper describes the Description Logics system C3L++ that is implemented on top of the object-oriented POET data base. The benefits of such an integration are the management of large size knowledge bases, an increased performance and data persistency. Moreover, it is planned to integrate the relational database MERLIN via an object-oriented access layer in C3L++ and test afterwards its performance.

Reference-contexts: A more sophisticated knowledge base test generator is currently in study. It promises to engender nested concepts with varying degrees of complexity. Moreover, knowledge bases will be reasoned about by means of different inferences, e.g. sub-sumption, classification, in analogy to the tests done by <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> and [ 26 ] . But this time the topic is focus is performance be-haviour for large knowledge bases thanks to the integrated data base. The work will be oriented at the approach of Karp in [ 15 ] and [ 14 ] .

Reference-contexts: This approach will be em ployed for a Data Warehouse application [ 25 ] . 3. Configuration of a distributed electronic bus system aims at providing an interactive decision support for electronic engineers designing CAN bus application in ve hicles <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , [ 18 ] , [ 17 ] . These projects have in common that they require high performance, large size knowledge bases and data persistency. <p> C3L is founded on a frame-based implementation and proposes in analogy to [ 22 ] a distributed concept and attribute specific subsumption <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . Another particularity of C3L is the integration of procedural attachments, 1 i.e. methods and demons, in form of tasks [ 18 ] . This explicit declarative modeling of tasks is oriented at SCARP [ 32 ] and LISA [ 13 ] . <p> A sufficient access to the data is important for the configuration process. E.g. during the configuration the engineer has to find the appropriate compartment for a component. It is necessary to check whether the properties offered by a component match the demands of the compartments <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . Typical properties are for example temperature, water resistance or electromagnetic compatibility conditions. Two different approaches could be used to solve this problem. The first is that the engineer proposes a compartment and the system checks whether the properties match or not.
