Reference-contexts: Different shapes can be associated with the flashlight to produce conical, pyramidal, etc. volumes of interest. Another system of related interest to this thesis is NASA's Virtual Wind Tunnel, developed by Bryson and Levit <ref> [2] </ref>. This system is a flow field visualization tool that makes use of some specialized input and output hardware to immerse the user into the system. First of all, the Virtual Wind Tunnel uses an immersive display so that the user gets the impression of being inside the wind tunnel.

Reference-contexts: Donald Norman describes artifacts as "tools or devices that enhance human ability and performance" <ref> [4] </ref>. In the physical world, these artifacts are actual tools such as pulleys to make people stronger or cars to make them faster. Using the pulley as an example, the person is empowered to lift heavier objects.

Reference-contexts: The user specifies the cut volume by drawing out shapes such as boxes, ellipsoids, and extruded polygons with a mouse. The extracted region is then volume rendered. A similar approach is reported by Cignoni, Montani, and Scopigno <ref> [5] </ref> with their MagicSpheres. Here, a spherical volume of 3 interest is specified. Then, one or more filters associated with different visualization techniques are applied to the volume of interest. Another variation is to use the flashlight metaphor [16] to shine on the volume of interest.

Reference-contexts: It is also designed to support other metaphors beyond those reported here. An overview of the system architecture is depicted in figure 1. It is similar to the application independent device interface described in <ref> [8] </ref>. The important feature is that system components such as the device interfaces, and visualization operations are abstracted from the application. There are four major components in our system. They are the Glove and Tracker libraries, the Posture Recognition component, and the Visualization component.

Reference-contexts: General visualization systems such as AVS and Data Explorer, as well as more application domain specific systems such as VIS5D <ref> [9] </ref> and OVIRT [12] all provide cutting planes with options for pseudo-coloring or contouring the cross-sections. Some of them limit the cutting planes to the three orthogonal directions, while others allow arbitrary planes. These planes are usually specified by entering numeric coordinate values or by adjusting graphical sliders.

Reference-contexts: These are isosurfaces and pseudo-coloring of cut surfaces. An isosurface is created by tiling points in the data set with the same constant value. Here, we use the marching cubes algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> with a modified lookup table to remove ambiguities. Isosurfaces are rendered transparently so that tools manipulated within the data are always visible to the user.

Reference-contexts: Instead of grabbing and rotating or translating, the user's hand is more intimately linked to the tool. Our work also differs from other work that applies virtual reality interfaces to visualization, notably the use of 3D widgets such as a floating rectangle to represent a cutting plane <ref> [11] </ref>. Here the users specify the cut by grabbing anchor points (e.g. vertices, edges, plane center) and moving the rectangle around. Our work take this a step further and insist that the users' hand be the tool.

Reference-contexts: While these may be the only way to specify curve cross-sections with 2D input devices, the availability of 3D input devices can make this task easier and more natural. A paper by Ney and Fishman details the features of another visualization system designed for use on medical data <ref> [13] </ref>. Instead of using cutting planes, this system uses cutting volumes to identify pieces of a larger data set. The user specifies the cut volume by drawing out shapes such as boxes, ellipsoids, and extruded polygons with a mouse. The extracted region is then volume rendered.

Reference-contexts: Some of them limit the cutting planes to the three orthogonal directions, while others allow arbitrary planes. These planes are usually specified by entering numeric coordinate values or by adjusting graphical sliders. An alternative way of specifying arbitrary planes is through a 3D spray can widget <ref> [15] </ref>. Here, the plane is normal to a line originating from the nozzle of the spray can widget. As the spray can is moved and rotated, a new cut plane is generated. <p> We have identified and used other metaphors aside from the cutting tools, for example, spray cans and flashlights <ref> [15] </ref>. However, we have not adapted these to direct manipulation interfaces. Besides making interaction easy for a single user, a multiple-user setup could assist in collaboration and instruction.

By moving this tracker around, the user would effectively change his viewing position. Holding the tracker away from his body and pointing it back at himself would result in a view from behind the data.

Rhodes et al. <ref> [18] </ref> and Udupa and Odhner [24] describe visualization systems targeted for visualization of volumetric medical data. Both of these allow specifications of curved cross-sections. In the former, the user specifies points with a trackball along the desired curve from a sagittal (side) cross-sectional view.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have asked how the user thinks and how to adapt systems to both take advantage of thought processes and to improve user understanding in complex tasks. Sellen, Kurtenbach, and Buxton describe an experiment in which they try to help users avoid mode errors <ref> [22] </ref>. Mode errors are mistakes that occur when the user tries to give the computer a command when in fact the computer is in a mode that does not accept that command.
