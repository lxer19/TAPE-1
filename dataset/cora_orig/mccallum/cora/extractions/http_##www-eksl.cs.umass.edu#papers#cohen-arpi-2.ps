Reference-contexts: Similarly, the user may take actions for which aide can find no justification; aide must nevertheless follow the path set by the user, to contribute to the exploration once it again reaches a familiar point. This issue involves maintaining shared knowledge about a problem to be cooperatively solved <ref> (Allen 1994) </ref>. aide's solution relies partially on the notion of common statistical practice and its relationship to planning. In many situations data analysis follows well-understood paths, involving procedures familiar to most users. For example, if one generates a regression fit for a relationship, one also generates residuals. <p> For these reasons aide needs to give the user access to its decision-making process. Recent research has drawn a useful analogy between mixed-initiative planning and a dialog between problem-solving agents <ref> (Allen 1994) </ref>. James Allen identifies three distinguishing characteristics of mixed-initiative planning: flexible, opportunistic control of initiative; the ability to change focus of attention; mechanisms for maintaining shared, implicit knowledge. aide meets these requirements as follows. aide's control of initiative changes with context.

Reference-contexts: A mixed-initiative planning environment aide is built around a partial hierarchical planner (St. Amant & Cohen 1996). Systems that use this approach include PRS (Georgeff & Lansky 1987), the phoenix planner (Cohen et al. 1989) and the RESUN system <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1993) </ref>. Rather than constructing plans from primitive actions, starting from scratch for each new problem, the aide planner relies on a library of abstract plans and primitive actions for its processing.

Reference-contexts: Performance Assessment The pathology prediction demon models each ship as a probability distribution of arrival times. Combining this distribution with the current state of each port, the demon arrives at a predicted docking queue length. The model is similar to that used in <ref> (Muscetolla & Smith 1987) </ref> for exploring the effects of resource allocation decisions. Long docking queues indicate the presence of a bottleneck. Several factors affect the accuracy of the demon's predictions.

Reference-contexts: Humans and Agents Working Together In another study, we demonstrated that humans and the plan steering agent perform better together than either does alone <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1994) </ref>. Space precludes a detailed account of the study. The major conclusions, however, are these: Humans are not good at steering plans in real time; they make fewer adjustments than are necessary. The plan steering agent, in contrast, makes too many adjustments.

Reference-contexts: The agent then uses simple heuristics to generate advice that, when implemented, will either alleviate or avoid the predicted bottleneck. This may be contrasted with reactive approaches, such as <ref> (Ow, Smith, & Thiriez 1988) </ref> and (Prosser 1989), that respond to unexpected events at the time that they occur. Currently, the only advice the agent offers is based on a simple rerouting heuristic.

Reference-contexts: That is, the demon only uses information local to a given port. Resource-based schedule revision with local information was used successfully in <ref> (Smith et al. 1990) </ref>. The schedule maintenance agent combines the demon's predictions for multiple days in the future to determine which ports are likely to become clogged. The agent then uses simple heuristics to generate advice that, when implemented, will either alleviate or avoid the predicted bottleneck.
