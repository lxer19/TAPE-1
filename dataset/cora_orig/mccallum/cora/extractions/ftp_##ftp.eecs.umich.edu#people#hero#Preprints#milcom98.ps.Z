Title: Power vs. Performance Tradeoffs for Reduced Resolution Adaptive Equalizers

Abstract: Adaptive channel equalization algorithms are commonly used in wireless communications receivers to counter intersymbol interference, multi-path dispersion, and other time varying channel degradations. In this paper we obtain approximate expressions for the increase in mean square error of the LMS adaptive algorithm when the total processing power is decreased by reducing the number of data and filter coefficient bits used by the algorithm. We also obtain expressions for the power-optimal bit-allocation factor which determines the proportion of the bits allocated to the data vs. allocated to the coefficients. Numerical studies are presented for an exponential memory ISI channel and 4-ary PSK signalling. These studies indicate that as few as 8 bits total are needed to equalize the channel and that most of these bits (6 out of 8) should be allocated to the filter coefficients.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we focus on the steady state tracking phase. We first present a formula for the increase in steady state mean square error (MSE) due to quantization which generalizes the formulas of Caraiscos and Liu <ref> [8] </ref> to the case of complex data and coefficients. We then derive a pair of optimal bit-allocation factors which minimize the increase in MSE subject to: 1) a total bit-width constraint; and 2) a total power consumption constraint. <p> The expression above applies to complex sequences and is derived in a very similar manner to the derivation of Caraiscos and Liu <ref> [8] </ref> for real-valued sequences. As in [8] we make several standard assumptions including: the process x k is circularly Gaussian, the quantization error is a zero mean white sequence, the quantization errors are independent of the data x k and the filter coefficients w k . <p> The expression above applies to complex sequences and is derived in a very similar manner to the derivation of Caraiscos and Liu <ref> [8] </ref> for real-valued sequences.

Reference-contexts: II. REGISTER LENGTH AND POWER It is well known that the power consumed by the operation of loading successive time samples of a random sequence into a B-bit register is proportional to the average number of bit flips induced in the register <ref> [9] </ref>. While for a white sequence the average number of bit flips is B, in 2 general this average can be much less than B for a correlated sequence. This is because for correlated sequences higher order bits have lower probability of transitioning than lower order bits. <p> This is because for correlated sequences higher order bits have lower probability of transitioning than lower order bits. Several models for the power consumption of register loading have been proposed <ref> [9] </ref>.
