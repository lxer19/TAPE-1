Title: still get the same representation, W (j), for the final node reached. Hence, such paths
Abstract: X(h) = d. Assume now that h b1 and h f2 &gt; 1. Thus, there must be at least one value, say k, such that X(i) = k after i 0 , i 1 and i 2 hops, where 0 &lt; i 0 &lt; i 1 &lt; i 2 &lt; h. It must be the case that i 0 and i 2 are hops in the same direction while i 1 is a hop in the opposite direction. The symbols inserted at hop i 0 and i 1 are both shifted out and hence do not help form the final representation W (j). Thus, a shorter path in which the two hops at i 0 and i 1 are not present exists. This contradicts our assumption that fbfb was a shortest path. The proof for bfbf is identical to the one above. Since all paths other than f, b, fb, bf, fbf and bfb, have either fbfb or bfbf as subsequences, it follows that none of them are shortest paths in the bi-directional shu*enet topology. Thus, we have proved that only paths of the type f, b, fb, bf, fbf and bfb provide shortest paths in this topology. The same argomentation allows to state that for each shortest path of kind fbf or bfb, the longest sequence of hops in the same direction nust be the central. In fact if the central sequence (assumed of kind b without loss in generality) is composed only by one hop, a sequence composed by one forward hop followed by a backward hop followed by another forward hop exists. If the central sequence is longer then 1 hop but not greater than the other two sequences there must be at least one value, say k, such that X(i) = k after i 0 , i 1 i 2 .
