Title: Characterising Innateness in Artificial and Natural Learning  
Author: Jean-Louis Dessalles 
Address: 46 rue Barrault F-75013 Paris France  
Affiliation: Ecole Nationale Suprieure des Tlcommunications  
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a refinement of the notion of innateness. If we merely identify innateness with bias, then we obtain a poor characterisation of this notion, since any learning device relies on a bias that makes it choose a given hypothesis instead of another. We show that our intuition of innateness is better captured by a characteristic of bias, related to isotropy. Generalist models of learning are shown to rely on an isotropic bias, whereas the bias of specialised models, which include some specific a priori knowledge about what is to be learned, is necessarily anisotropic. The socalled generalist models, however, turn out to be specialised in some way: they learn symmetrical forms preferentially, and have strictly no deficiencies in their learning ability. Because some learning beings do not always show these two properties, such generalist models may be sometimes ruled out as bad candidates for cognitive modelling.

Reference-contexts: In several cases, a specialised connectionist architecture can reproduce the childs performance. The design of such architectures is suggested by general principles, it does not include an a priori knowledge of what is to be learned, contrary to what is claimed in other theories of learning <ref> (Chomsky, 1968) </ref>. This does not mean that the connectionist devices used by these authors are not tuned for the task they perform. Each relies indeed on a bias that allows it to correctly induce.

Reference-contexts: Face recognition could be one such module, but the archetypal example is certainly language processing. Chomsky (1968, 1988) asserts that humans are innately biased to learn a small number of language structures. The corresponding learning mechanism, the setting of parameters <ref> (Lightfoot, 1991, Crain, 1991) </ref> is by no means indifferent: it relies on a matching with preexisting structures. Imagine that in a remote area, natives speak a strange language: it is like English, except that some words are systematically permuted in each sentence, for instance the first and the fourth.

Reference-contexts: This system is not indifferent. There is an absolute reference that assigns a priori different roles to coordinates. Any system that makes use of a priori knowledge, as for instance structured matching systems <ref> (Ganascia, 1987) </ref> has little chance to be indifferent. 3 Limits of Generalist Learning models Learning systems which are claimed to be generalist, i.e. which are supposed to learn under a large variety of circumstances, are generally indifferent. This is true of most statistical algorithms, connectionist systems included.

Reference-contexts: Strattons well-known experiments show that if you see the world upside-down through special glasses, then after a week without removing the glasses the world no longer looks weird <ref> (Gregory, 1966) </ref>. This strongly suggests that visual perception, when acquired by newborns, may be indifferent to 180 rotation. However, we cannot conclude that our visual system is not a priori sensitive to absolute parameters.

Reference-contexts: It does not depend on the choice of a learning accuracy measure. As a consequence, it can be used to characterise a large variety of learning situations, as we will see. A Kohonen network <ref> (Kohonen, 1984) </ref>, completed with a decision device, is an indifferent system: both wiring and algorithm make reference to relative properties of the input only. Usual multilayer perceptrons are almost indifferent: they are indifferent to all isometries, except for permutations between data inputs and supervision inputs.

Reference-contexts: Psychologists showed that our perception relies on absolute preferences. For instance, we are sensitive to figure-ground contrast (Wertheimer, 1923). Psychologists also gave evidence showing childrens preferences for whole objects when learning word meaning <ref> (Markman, 1990) </ref>. Figure-ground contrast and object continuity disappear when images are shuffled, and we may predict that children living with shuffled perception would not be able to recover them. Another illustration of absolute bias in visual perception is given by the specific processing devoted to face recognition.

Reference-contexts: For instance in the case of the bicycle, we would opt for the second hypothesis. The core of Jean Piagets theory is the existence of definite stable states the child may reach <ref> (Piaget, 1967) </ref> . These states are characterised by a set of operations the child can perform, which is closed for the combinations that the child is able to conceive. When this set reaches a group structure, then learning is complete (until a new kind of operation is discovered).

Reference-contexts: We cannot say anything about the harmony of these forms, but convergence must result in this case from the reliability of data. In the case of language acquisition, this constraint has often been acknowledged ( e.g. <ref> (Plunkett & Marchman, 1990) </ref>) or presented as problematic by some authors, as we will see. 5.2 Learning Inharmonious Forms Some aspects of visual perception are claimed to be indifferent.
Reference: <author> Rock, I. & Palmer, S. </author> <year> (1991). </year> <institution> "L'hritage du gestaltisme". Pour La Science , 160 </institution> . 
Reference-contexts: For instance, the visual system is supposed to prefer the most regular and symmetrical perception which is compatible with sensory data. Good images, which can be described using less information, are faster recognised and are better memorised than odd ones <ref> (Rock & Palmer, 1991) </ref>. Furthermore, any departure from symmetry is perceived as such and is analysed as revealing the history of the object (Leyton, 1993). <p> According to the Gestalt theory, this holds not only for perception, but also for many abstract forms of learning, including the learning of conceptual knowledge, as Fritz Heider suggests it <ref> (Rock & Palmer, 1991) </ref>. This theory explains the convergence between mental processes acquired by different individuals by the existence of these harmonious shapes. This strongly suggests that an indifferent learning mechanism is involved. We mentioned above that Piagets theory predicts a few learnable forms.

Reference-contexts: As we will see, it proves to be a quite strong limitation. The absence of really generalist learners is predicted by Schaffers conservation law, which states that a learning device A cannot be always good: its generalisation accuracy is equivalent to random when averaged on all possible preexisting regularities <ref> (Schaffer, 1994) </ref>. In other words, any learner must have its preferred learning situations in which it performs efficiently. Our result shows that indifferent systems perform well on harmonious forms.

Reference-contexts: Another illustration of absolute bias in visual perception is given by the specific processing devoted to face recognition. A small region of our brain, located in the parieto-occipito-temporal area, seems necessary for the recognition of familiar faces <ref> (Tranel & Damasio, 1985) </ref>. Again, we hardly imagine that such a system could operate on shuffled images and that children could develop normally in a world peopled by Picasso-like faces. Some mechanisms that have been suggested to explain convergent human learning of language depart explicitly from indifference.
