Title: Time-Series Similarity Problems and Well-Separated Geometric Sets  
Author: Bela Bollobas Gautam Das Dimitrios Gunopulos Heikki Mannila 
Abstract: Given a pair of nonidentical complex objects, defining (and determining) how similar they are to each other is a nontrivial problem. In data mining applications, one frequently needs to determine the similarity between two time series. We analyze a model of time-series similarity that allows outliers, and different scaling functions. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms for computing this notion of similarity. The algorithms are based on nontrivial tools and methods from computational geometry. In particular, we use properties of families of well-separated geometric sets. The randomized algorithm has provably good performance and also works extremely efficiently in practice.

Reference-contexts: Given two sequences of length n, the longest common subsequence can be found in O (n 2 ) time by a well known dynamic programming algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>; This algorithm can easily be modified to compute S f;*;ffi (X; Y ) in O (nffi) time where f is a given linear function. Note that this is essentially linear time. We refer to this algorithm as the LCSS algorithm.

Reference-contexts: A family of finite sets S 2 V is k-separated if for all S i ; S j 2 S, jS i S j j &gt; k. It is known that there exist a k-separated family S where jSj = 2 ffn where ff depends on k=n <ref> [4] </ref>. However, we can get much better upper bounds if we only consider certain kinds of geometric sets. Consider the following set system. Let R be a fixed set of n line segments on the plane.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Being able to measure the similarity between objects is a crucial issue in many data retrieval and data mining applications; see <ref> [9] </ref> for a general discussion on similarity queries. Typically, the task is to define a function Sim (X; Y ), where X and Y are two objects of a certain class, and the function value represents how "similar" they are to each other.
