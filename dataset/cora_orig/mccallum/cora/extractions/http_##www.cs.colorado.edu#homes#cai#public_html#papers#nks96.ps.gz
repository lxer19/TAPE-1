Abstract: We study parallel two-level overlapping Schwarz algorithms for solving nonlinear finite element problems, in particular, for the full potential equation of aerodynamics discretized in two dimensions with bilinear elements. The main algorithm, Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS), employs an inexact finite-difference Newton method and a Krylov space iterative method, with a two-level overlapping Schwarz method as a preconditioner. We demonstrate that NKS, combined with a density upwinding continuation strategy for problems with weak shocks, can be made robust for this class of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations, with proper specification of several parameters. We study upwinding parameters, inner convergence tolerance, coarse grid density, subdomain overlap, and the level of fill-ins in the incomplete factorization, and report favorable choices for numerical convergence rate, overall execution time, and parallel efficiency on a distributed-memory parallel computer. 1. Introduction. In the past few years domain decomposition methods for linear partial differential equations, including overlapping Schwarz methods [9, 12, 13, 36], have graduated from theory into practice in many applications [17, 26, 27, 33]. In this paper, we

Reference-contexts: Both coarse and fine grids cover the entire , and they share the same boundary, which they both resolve exactly because of its prescribed simplicity. (The case of a multi-level Schwarz preconditioner for geometrically complex grids, in which only the finest level exactly resolves the boundary geometry is considered in <ref> [10] </ref>.) The coarse grid preconditioning matrix B 0 is defined by using formula (11) with respect to the basis functions f i g. The coarse grid matrix arises from an independent discretization, not an agglomeration of fine grid matrix.

In practice, the method is insensitive to the details of the method used to determine k . Much more important is nonlinear continuation in grid density, dissipation, and other parameters. The iteration is continued until convergence, typically defined in terms of a sufficiently small kF ( k )k.

On each processor, we store the subvectors and subblocks of the Jacobian matrix associated with an extended subdomain. For the coarse-grid precondi-tioner, the right-hand vector is built by a parallel fine-to-coarse restriction operation.

Reference-contexts: Once the function f (x) is given, this condition becomes @ = q 1 f (x): * On 1 and 3 , we impose for symmetry the no penetration condition @ = @y The functional form used for the NACA0012 geometry <ref> [37] </ref> is f (x) = 0:17814 ( x x) + 0:10128 (x (1 x)) 0:10968x 2 (1 x) + 0:06090x 3 (1 x); for x 2 (0; 1). This unit interval is scaled to (1/3, 2/3) in the overall domain.

Reference-contexts: Newton-Krylov methods <ref> [2, 3, 14, 15, 38] </ref> are potentially well suited and increasingly popular for the implicit solution of nonlinear problems whenever it is expensive to compute or store a true Jacobian.

Reference-contexts: The coarse grid operator B 1 0 is always applied exactly. Some detailed comparisons of (17) with global ILU preconditioners on rather general scalar problems can be found in [5]. Experience with transonic potential problems in the Boeing TRANAIR code can be found in <ref> [39] </ref>. 5. Parallel implementation issues. We implemented the family of NKS algorithms on the IBM SP2. The top-level message-passing calls are implemented through the Chameleon Package of Gropp and Smith [19], which uses the IBM MPL library. The code is written in a hostless manner.

Reference-contexts: A well resolved shock will take many Newton steps to settle on its correct location, whereas a diffuse shock centers quickly on this location. A carefully chosen sequence of M c and -0 can considerably accelerate the Newton's convergence; more details on this "viscosity damping" can be found in <ref> [40] </ref>. Another way to control the convergence of Newton's method is through the use of iterated maximization of the switching function, as described below and first discussed in [22].
