Abstract: Pseudo noise sequences belong to the family of functions that can be implemented by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) as shown in Figure 13. A LFSR is fully characterized by its state vector S, which is given by (s m-1 , s m-2 , s m-3 , ......, s 3 , s 2 , s 1 ). The system takes no input except for the initial state vector. At each clock cycle the LFSR generates 1 bit of output and shifts the state vector to the right. An LFSR is said to have a period T if its output repeats itself with after T clock cycles. m where the a I s are exclusively from the binary field -0,1- and all arithmetic is modulo 2. We define the sequence generated by a binary polynomial as the LFSRs can be used to generate clock sequences by initializing the state vector with the address of the source. We are interested in LFSRs whose characteristic functions are primary polynomials. A primary polynomial is said to be a binary polynomial is a primary polynomial that cannot be expressed as a product of two or more binary polynomials of degree greater than 1 and the Properties 1 and 2 allow us to separate the collisions between the experiments of two sources. Property 3 allows us to choose the polynomial to use at run time. In using the pseudo noise sequences as clock, we will use the edge transitions as clock pulses. It can be shown that the sequence of sequence generated by P(x) has a period of 2

Reference-contexts: One of the disadvantages of using ThinStreams is slow convergence. Since ThinStreams splits a video layer among many multicast groups, each of which must be joined separately, many groups must be joined before the video quality increases significantly. Our experiences with video perception <ref> [9] </ref> show that users do not want the video quality to oscillate rapidly but prefer it to change more slowly. Thus, we conjecture that the slow rate of convergence will not be a problem in practice. We will continue tuning the algorithm and architecture.
