Abstract: This memo describes a protocol utilizing security concepts necessary for establishing Security Associations (SA) and cryptographic keys in an Internet environment. A Security Association protocol that negotiates, establishes, modifies and deletes Security Associations and their attributes is required for an evolving Internet, where there will be numerous security mechanisms and several options for each security mechanism. The key management protocol must be robust in order to handle public key generation for the Internet community at large and private key requirements for those private networks with that requirement. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines the procedures for authenticating a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations, key generation techniques, and threat mitigation (e.g. denial of service and replay attacks). All of these are necessary to establish and maintain secure communications (via IP Security Service or any other security protocol) in an Internet environment. This document is being submitted to the IETF Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) Working Group for consideration as a method for the establishment and management of security associations and their appropriate security attributes. Additionally, this document proposes a method for key management to support IPSEC and IPv6. It is intended that a future version of this draft be submitted to the IESG for publication as a Draft Standard RFC. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the authors and/or the IPSEC working group mailing list at ipsec@tis.com. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "working draft" or "work in progress."

Reference-contexts: The Internet Policy Registration Authority (IPRA) [RFC-1422] has been established to direct this infrastructure for the IETF. The IPRA certifies Policy Certification Authorities (PCA). PCAs control Certificate Authorities (CA) which certify users and subordinate entities. Current certificate related work includes the Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions <ref> [DNSSEC] </ref> which will provide signed entity keys in the DNS. The Public Key Infrastucture (PKIX) working group is specifying an Internet profile for X.509 certificates. There is also work going on in industry to develop X.500 Directory Services which would provide X.509 certificates to users. The U.S. <p> Certificate payloads SHOULD be included in an exchange whenever an appropriate directory service (e.g. Secure DNS <ref> [DNSSEC] </ref>) is not available to distribute certificates. The Certificate payload MUST be accepted at any point during an exchange. Figure 10 shows the format of the Certificate Payload. <p> The payload type for the Certificate Payload is six (6). 3.10 Certificate Request Payload The Certificate Request Payload provides a means to request certificates via ISAKMP and can appear in any message. Certificate Request payloads SHOULD be included in an exchange whenever an appropriate directory service (e.g. Secure DNS <ref> [DNSSEC] </ref>) is not available to distribute certificates. The Certificate Request payload MUST be accepted at any point during the exchange.

Reference-contexts: Maughan, Schertler, Schneider, Turner draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-10.txt, .ps [Page 5] INTERNET-DRAFT ISAKMP July 3, 1998 1.2 The Need for Negotiation ISAKMP extends the assertion in <ref> [DOW92] </ref> that authentication and key exchanges must be combined for better security to include security association exchanges. The security services required for communications depends on the individual network configurations and environments. <p> The SA concept is required to support security protocols in a diverse and dynamic networking environment. Just as authentication and key exchange must be linked to provide assurance that the key is established with the authenticated party <ref> [DOW92] </ref>, SA establishment must be linked with the authentication and the key exchange protocol. ISAKMP provides the protocol exchanges to establish a security association between negotiating entities followed by the establishment of a security association by these negotiating entities in behalf of some protocol (e.g. ESP/AH). <p> Many key generation algorithms, that have different properties, are available to users (see <ref> [DOW92] </ref>, [ANSI], and [Oakley]). Properties of key exchange protocols include the key establishment method, authentication, symmetry, perfect forward secrecy, and back traffic protection. NOTE: Cryptographic keys can protect information for a considerable length of time. <p> This is desirable so that computation of the keys does not require either party to know who initiated the exchange. While key exchange symmetry is desirable, symmetry in the entire key management protocol may provide a vulnerablity to reflection attacks. Perfect Forward Secrecy: As described in <ref> [DOW92] </ref>, an authenticated key exchange protocol provides perfect forward secrecy if disclosure of long-term secret keying material does not compromise the secrecy of the exchanged keys from previous communications.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, sending one-way hashed poorly-chosen keys with low entropy is also weak, due to the threat of brute-force guessing attacks on the sniffed messages. While passwords can be used for establishing identity, they are not considered in this context because of recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board <ref> [IAB] </ref>. Digital signatures, such as the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) signature, are public key based strong authentication mechanisms. When using public key digital signatures each entity requires a public key and a private key. Certificates are an essential part of a digital signature authentication mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The property of perfect forward secrecy does not apply to key exchange without authentication. 1.6.2 ISAKMP Requirements An authenticated key exchange MUST be supported by ISAKMP. Users SHOULD choose additional key establishment algorithms based on their requirements. ISAKMP does not specify a specific key exchange. However, <ref> [IKE] </ref> describes a proposal for using the Oakley key exchange [Oakley] in conjunction with ISAKMP. Requirements that should be evaluated when choosing a key establishment algorithm include establishment method (generation vs. transport), perfect forward secrecy, computational overhead, key escrow, and key strength. <p> This section describes the procedures for SA establishment and SA modification, followed by a default set of exchanges that MAY be used for initial interoperability. Other exchanges will be defined depending on the DOI and key exchange. [IPDOI] and <ref> [IKE] </ref> are examples of how this is achieved. Appendix B explains the procedures for accomplishing these additions. 4.1 ISAKMP Exchange Types ISAKMP allows the creation of exchanges for the establishment of Security Associations and keying material. There are currently five default Exchange Types defined for ISAKMP. <p> This section describes the ISAKMP values for the Internet IP Security DOI, supported security protocols, and identification values for ISAKMP Phase 1 negotiations. The Internet IP Security DOI is MANDATORY to implement for IP Security. [Oakley] and <ref> [IKE] </ref> describe, in detail, the mechanisms and their application for establishing and managing Security Associations and cryptographic keys for IP Security. A.2 Internet IP Security DOI Assigned Value As described in [IPDOI], the Internet IP Security DOI Assigned Number is one (1). <p> Maughan, Schertler, Schneider, Turner draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-10.txt, .ps [Page 64] INTERNET-DRAFT ISAKMP July 3, 1998 Acknowledgements Dan Harkins, Dave Carrel, and Derrell Piper of Cisco Systems provided design assistance with the protocol and coordination for the <ref> [IKE] </ref> and [IPDOI] documents. Hilarie Orman, via the Oakley key exchange protocol, has significantly influenced the design of ISAKMP. Marsha Gross, Bill Kutz, Mike Oehler, Pete Sell, and Ruth Taylor provided significant input and review to this document.

Reference-contexts: Other protocols that provide algorithm and mechanism independent security MUST define their requirements for SA attributes. The separation of ISAKMP from a specific SA definition is important to ensure ISAKMP can establish SAs for all possible security protocols and applications. NOTE: See <ref> [IPDOI] </ref> for a discussion of SA attributes that should be considered when defining a security protocol or application. <p> The rules for the IETF IP Security DOI are presented in <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. Specifications of the rules for customized DOIs will be presented in separate documents. Situation: A situation contains all of the security-relevant information that a system considers necessary to decide the security services required to protect the session being negotiated. <p> A payload consists of a generic payload header and a string of octects that is opaque to ISAKMP. ISAKMP uses DOI-specific functionality to synthesize and interpret these payloads. Multiple payloads can be sent in a single ISAKMP message. See section 3 for more details on the payload types, and <ref> [IPDOI] </ref> for the formats of the IETF IP Security DOI payloads. Exchange Type: An exchange type is a specification of the number of messages in an ISAKMP exchange, and the payload types that are contained in each of those messages. <p> During the SA establishment, a SPI MUST be generated. ISAKMP is designed to handle variable sized SPIs. This is accomplished by using the SPI Size field within the Proposal payload during SA establishment. Handling of SPIs will be outlined by the DOI specification (e.g. <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>). When a security association (SA) is initially established, one side assumes the role of initiator and the other the role of responder. Once the SA is established, both the original initiator and responder can initiate a phase 2 negotiation with the peer entity. <p> The length of the Data Attributes will either be 4 octets or defined by the Attribute Length field. This is done using the Attribute Format bit described below. Specific information about the attributes for each domain will be described in a DOI document, e.g. IPSEC DOI <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. 1 2 3 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+++-+-+-+-+++-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+ !A! Attribute Type ! AF=0 Attribute Length ! !F! ! AF=1 Attribute Value ! +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+++-+-+-+-+++-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+ . AF=0 Attribute Value . . <p> A DOI value of 0 during a Phase 1 exchange specifies a Generic ISAKMP SA which can be used for any protocol during the Phase 2 exchange. The necessary SA Attributes are defined in A.4. A DOI value of 1 is assigned to the IPsec DOI <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. All other DOI values are reserved to IANA for future use. IANA will not normally assign a DOI value without referencing some public specification, such as an Internet RFC. Other DOI's can be defined using the description in appendix B. <p> The Situation is used to make policy decisions regarding the security attributes being negotiated. Specifics for the IETF IP Security DOI Situation are detailed in <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. This field MUST be present within the Security Association payload. The payload type for the Security Association Payload is one (1). 3.5 Proposal Payload The Proposal Payload contains information used during Security Association negotiation. <p> If unused, then this field MUST be set to 0. * Identification Data (variable length) Contains identity information. The values for this field are DOI specific and the format is specified by the ID Type field. Specific details for the IETF IP Security DOI Identification Data are detailed in <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. The payload type for the Identification Payload is five (5). 3.9 Certificate Payload The Certificate Payload provides a means to transport certificates or other certificate-related information via ISAKMP and can appear in any ISAKMP message. Certificate payloads SHOULD be included in an exchange whenever an appropriate directory service (e.g. <p> This section describes the procedures for SA establishment and SA modification, followed by a default set of exchanges that MAY be used for initial interoperability. Other exchanges will be defined depending on the DOI and key exchange. <ref> [IPDOI] </ref> and [IKE] are examples of how this is achieved.

There are currently five default Exchange Types defined for ISAKMP. <p> The Internet IP Security DOI is MANDATORY to implement for IP Security. [Oakley] and [IKE] describe, in detail, the mechanisms and their application for establishing and managing Security Associations and cryptographic keys for IP Security. A.2 Internet IP Security DOI Assigned Value As described in <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>, the Internet IP Security DOI Assigned Number is one (1). A.3 Supported Security Protocols Values for supported security protocols are specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [STD-2]. <p> Also, a particular group may have a need for a new exchange type, for example to support key management for multicast groups. This section discusses guidelines for defining a new DOI. The full specification for the Internet DOI can be found in <ref> [IPDOI] </ref>. Defining a new DOI is likely to be a time-consuming process. If at all possible, it is recommended that the designer begin with an existing DOI and customize only the parts that are unacceptable. <p> Maughan, Schertler, Schneider, Turner draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-10.txt, .ps [Page 64] INTERNET-DRAFT ISAKMP July 3, 1998 Acknowledgements Dan Harkins, Dave Carrel, and Derrell Piper of Cisco Systems provided design assistance with the protocol and coordination for the [IKE] and <ref> [IPDOI] </ref> documents.

Reference-contexts: Absolute protection against denial of service is impossible, but this anti-clogging token provides a technique for making it easier to handle. The use of an anti-clogging token was introduced by Karn and Simpson in <ref> [Karn] </ref>. It should be noted that in the exchanges shown in section 4, the anti-clogging mechanism should be used in conjuction with a garbage-state collection mechanism; an attacker can still flood a server using packets with bogus IP addresses and cause state to be created. <p> Such aggressive memory management techniques SHOULD be employed by protocols using ISAKMP that do not go through an initial, anti-clogging only phase, as was done in <ref> [Karn] </ref>. 1.7.2 Connection Hijacking ISAKMP prevents connection hijacking by linking the authentication, key exchange and security association exchanges. <p> Maughan, Schertler, Schneider, Turner draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-10.txt, .ps [Page 16] INTERNET-DRAFT ISAKMP July 3, 1998 2.5.3 Anti-Clogging Token ("Cookie") Creation The details of cookie generation are implementation dependent, but MUST satisfy these basic requirements (originally stated by Phil Karn in <ref> [Karn] </ref>): 1. The cookie must depend on the specific parties. This prevents an attacker from obtaining a cookie using a real IP address and UDP port, and then using it to swamp the victim with Diffie-Hellman requests from randomly chosen IP addresses or ports. 2.

Detailed descriptions of these algorithms can be found in <ref> [Schneier] </ref>. There are a number of variations on these two key generation schemes and these variations do not necessarily interoperate. Key Exchange Authentication: Key exchanges may be authenticated during the protocol or after protocol completion.

Reference-contexts: All entities must adhere to the SA for secure communications to be possible. When accessing SA attributes, entities use a pointer or identifier refered to as the Security Parameter Index (SPI). <ref> [SEC-ARCH] </ref> provides details on IP Security Associations (SA) and Security Parameter Index (SPI) definitions. 1.4.1 Security Associations and Registration The SA attributes required and recommended for the IP Security (AH, ESP) are defined in [SEC-ARCH]. <p> SA attributes, entities use a pointer or identifier refered to as the Security Parameter Index (SPI). <ref> [SEC-ARCH] </ref> provides details on IP Security Associations (SA) and Security Parameter Index (SPI) definitions. 1.4.1 Security Associations and Registration The SA attributes required and recommended for the IP Security (AH, ESP) are defined in [SEC-ARCH]. The attributes specified for an IP Security SA include, but are not limited to, authentication mechanism, cryptographic algorithm, algorithm mode, key length, and Initialization Vector (IV). Other protocols that provide algorithm and mechanism independent security MUST define their requirements for SA attributes. <p> The issues of distributing SPIs for multicast traffic are presented in <ref> [SEC-ARCH] </ref>.

Proposal payloads may or may not have the same SPI, as this is implementation dependent. Each Transform Payload contains the specific security mechanisms to be used for the designated protocol. It is expected that the Proposal and Transform payloads will be used only during SA establishment negotiation. <p> Another issue that must be considered in the development of ISAKMP is the effect of firewalls on the protocol. Many firewalls filter out all UDP packets, making reliance on UDP questionable in certain environments. A number of very important security considerations are presented in <ref> [SEC-ARCH] </ref>. One bears repeating. Once a private session key is created, it must be safely stored. Failure to properly protect the private key from access both internal and external to the system completely nullifies any protection provided by the IP Security services.
