Abstract: A novel algorithm for diagnosing bridging faults in combinational circuits is presented. The voting model and its simplifications, the Wired-AND and Wired-OR models, are assumed. The diagnosis algorithm guarantees the object bridging fault (bridging fault in the circuit being diagnosed) to be in the final fault list. The novelty of the algorithm are: (i) unlike previous algorithms it does not use the full fault dictionary but uses only portions of the stuck-at fault dictionary which is computed dynamically; (ii) it enumerates the faults implicitly using a compact data structure; and (iii) fault dropping rules, using stuck-at fault simulation only, are used. The resulting algorithm is both time and space efficient. Experimental evaluation of the algorithm is presented.

Reference-contexts: If the lines have different values then the TSBF is activated. For NFTSBFs the same input vector must also propagate the faulty value to primary outputs. FTSBF however can be activated by one input vector and detected later by another input vector <ref> [4] </ref>. The idea behind the initialization procedure is as follows. If a TSBF is detected by T i , at least one of the two shorted lines must be in D c (T i ). <p> Let T (X) be the value at X on application of T to the fault free circuit. Then, excluding oscillations, if an input vector T detects the fault one of the following conditions must be satisfied <ref> [4] </ref>. 1. T (X) 6= T (Y ) and the fault exhibits Y s-a-T (X) behavior on application of T . 2. T (X) 6= T (Y ) and the fault exhibits X s-a-T (Y ) behavior on application of T . 3.

The above procedures can be simplified for the Wired models <ref> [10] </ref> because in this model TSBFs exhibit either s-a-0 (Wired-AND) or s-a-1 (Wired-OR).

Reference-contexts: Then, the voltage at the shorted point V br = R d R d +R u fi V dd . In the Voting Model, logic threshold, which is a function of the technology in use, for all gates is assumed fixed (eg 2:5V <ref> [25] </ref>). If R d R d +R u fi V dd is less ( greater ) than this threshold the logic value at the fault location is interpreted as 0 (1) by all gates driven by it and the TSBF is said to exhibit s-a-0 behavior (s-a-1 behavior). <p> The equivalent resistance is encoded in a table and used by our algorithm. Notation #p (#n) represent the number of pFETs (nFETs) in series, and p# (n#) represent the number of pFETs (nFETs) in parallel. 3 In Table 1 <ref> [25] </ref> nfactors ( pfactors ) is the strength of an nFET (pFET) network relative to an nFET (pFET). Thus two nFETs in series (2n) sinks about 63% of the current of one nFET. Table 2 [25] is derived from Table 1 by dividing the pfactors by the strength ratio of a <p> and p# (n#) represent the number of pFETs (nFETs) in parallel. 3 In Table 1 <ref> [25] </ref> nfactors ( pfactors ) is the strength of an nFET (pFET) network relative to an nFET (pFET). Thus two nFETs in series (2n) sinks about 63% of the current of one nFET. Table 2 [25] is derived from Table 1 by dividing the pfactors by the strength ratio of a pFET and an nFET assuming a 10% variation in fabrication process (max ratio and min ratio, respectively). For example, the entry for p2/3n is computed as follow. The pull-up strength of p2 is 0:72.
