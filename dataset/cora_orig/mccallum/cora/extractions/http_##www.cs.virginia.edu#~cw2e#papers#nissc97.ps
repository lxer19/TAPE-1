Reference-contexts: To answer this question, we first introduce a few concepts from the classical measurement theories <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Classical measurement theories tell us that a measurement is a mapping from an attribute in an empirical relational system to a numerical value in the formal, mathematical world. <p> An attribute can be measured using many different scales. For example, length can be measured in feet and inches as well as meters and centimeters. Temperatures can be measured in interval scales <ref> [1] </ref> such as Celsius and Fahrenheit, or in a ratio scale [1] such as Kelvin. Measurement scales determine how we measure things as well as how we interpret the measured values.

Measurement scales determine how we measure things as well as how we interpret the measured values. NISSC97 Chenxi Wang 3 There are many different types of measurement scales. Commonly used ones include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. <p> Ordinal scale preserves the ordering among classes or categories. The measured values are unique only up to orders. Addition, subtraction, and other arithmetic operations on the numerical values have no meaning. An example of ordinal scale is the Mohs scale of hardness for minerals <ref> [1] </ref>. Interval scales preserve not only the ordering but also the differences between ordered classes. That is, we can compare the differences between any two of the ordered classes in the range of the mapping. Addition and subtraction are acceptable, but not computing of ratios. <p> Ratio scales preserve ordering, differences and ratios among classes. The measurement mappings must start at an absolute zero and increase at equal intervals, known as units. All arithmetic operations are meaningful in a ratio scale. The Kelvin scale for temperature is a ratio scale <ref> [1] </ref> whereas Celsius and Fahrenheit are not. Units traditionally only apply to interval and ratio scales. Researchers have expanded the meaning of units as descriptions of categories for nominal and ordinal scales [2]. In the rest of the paper, we will use the broader definition of units. <p> Classical measurement theory <ref> [1] </ref> tells us that a valid measure is a mapping from an empirical domain to a numerical range such that the empirical relations are preserved and preserved by the numerical relations.

Reference-contexts: There are no general rules for determining the relative priorities of the elements besides careful use of ones expertise and judgment. While it is not possible to obtain completely objective weight assignments, we recommend an exercise used in Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) <ref> [3] </ref> to help identify the relative importance among sibling components. The technique of AHP is designed by Thomas Saaty. AHP elicits judgments in the form of pairwise comparisons. <p> A detailed description of AHP and the mathematics behind it can be found in Thomas Saatys book The Analytic Hierarchy Process <ref> [3] </ref>. We use an example to illustrate the AHP weight judgment method. Example 4: A student wants to determine the relative importance of four activities in his life: A parttime job, study, personal activities and social activities.

Reference-contexts: A more important step is to analyze the relationships among the interacting factors and their composite effects. The type of interactions among system components are far more complex than the classical logical relationships such as those used in fault tree analysis <ref> [5] </ref>. To permit a methodical building of representational models, we must be able to, at least conceptually, categorize these relationships using a set of well-defined rules. The following list describes a set of logical relations deployed by the SM framework, along with the composite rules associated with the relations. <p> If the results indicate good correlation, we can at least increase our confidence in the measurement. Besides careful, rigorous and complete experiment design, we must learn how to minimize extreme events and experiment errors. There are a host of studies on error handling techniques <ref> [5, 6, and 7] </ref>. How to design and conduct effective experiments is another ongoing effort of this research. The downside of formal experiments is that they could be extremely time-consuming and costly to operate. In reality, it is extremely difficult to conduct formal experimentation on large systems.
