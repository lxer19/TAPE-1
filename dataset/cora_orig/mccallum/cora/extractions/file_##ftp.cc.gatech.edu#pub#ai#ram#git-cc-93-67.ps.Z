Reference-contexts: The introspector compiles the heuristic knowledge into an association using a learning method similar to knowledge compilation <ref> (Anderson, 1989) </ref>. The motivation for this type of learning is performance gain through reduction of the number of intermediate steps when the system encounters a similar problem in the future, although use of this strategy also reinforces correct problem-solving sequences.

Reference-contexts: In general, associative knowledge contributes to the quality and correctness of the solution for a large number of the problem-solving situations. This was evident in our data from the electronics assembly plant, and has also been observed by other researchers <ref> (e.g., Arabian, 1989) </ref>. Thus, an important type of learning is one in which the operator learns associations through experience. Human operators involved in troubleshooting also appear to learn some heuristic knowledge.

Reference-contexts: An example of this approach is Morik's (1991) MOBAL system, in which learning occurs through the cooperation of several learning tools with each other and with the user. Another example of the toolbox class is the PRODIGY system <ref> (Carbonell, Knoblock, & Minton, 1991) </ref>. The system combines explanation-based learning, case-based (analogical) learning, abstraction, experimentation, static analysis, and tutoring. However, the system is designed as a research test-bed for analyzing and comparing various methods, rather than as a system that chooses a learning method itself.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis of the system revealed that developing a model of the troubleshooting operator would provide a structure for designing and implementing computer-based tools for this task. The effort would also facilitate formalization of the task, which could then be used in the design of instructional systems <ref> (Clancey, 1986) </ref>, thereby facilitating the development of a flexible work force that is complementary to the policy of the company. A schematic of the manufacturing plant is shown in figure 1. An unpopulated board enters the SMT line where it is populated with components, soldered, cleaned, and sheared.

Reference-contexts: Our project began when the plant became operational in January 1990 <ref> (Cohen, 1990) </ref>. At that time, the plant was facing typical start-up problems experienced by most new facilities. There were a high number of printed-circuit boards (PCBs) in the test and repair region waiting to undergo troubleshooting, 7 resulting in high work-in-process inventories. <p> We were interested both in comparing the results to the human data, as well as evaluating it as a machine learning system. 23 We evaluated the system using 42 actual problem-solving episodes gathered at the plant over a 2-month period <ref> (Cohen, 1990) </ref>. The problems dealt with various types of resistor failures and are representative of the types of problems encountered over the 2-month period. To evaluate the learning methods, we tested the following five conditions on the 42 test problems. * H (hand-coded): The original non-learning system with hand-coded associations.

Reference-contexts: We developed a computational model of an operator involved in the task of troubleshooting a faulty PCB. The model was based on protocol analysis of over 300 problem-solving episodes gathered in the ICT area of the NCR plant <ref> (Cohen, Mitchell, & Govindaraj, 1992) </ref>, and implemented 8 in a computer system that performed the troubleshooting task. Figure 2 shows part of an example troubleshooting protocol from Cohen (1990, p. 206).

Reference-contexts: More research is needed to develop such strategies. 3.2 The introspective multistrategy-learning module Our approach to multistrategy learning is based on the analysis of declarative traces of reasoning processes to determine what and how to learn <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1994) </ref>. A particular troubleshooting episode may involve many different associations, heuristics, and troubleshooting actions. <p> Similarly, the implementation of forgetting simply involves deletion of an association; clearly, human forgetting is a much more complex process <ref> (e.g., Cox, 1994) </ref>. Other such simplifications have been pointed out in the preceding technical discussion. It is interesting to note, however, that Meta-TS can model many aspects of the human data even with these simplifications. Meta-TS is also limited in certain ways as a computational model of human troubleshooting.

Reference-contexts: This strategy is triggered when the system arrives at an incorrect solution using heuristic and/or associative knowledge. The system attempts to acquire a correct associative knowledge from a skilled troubleshooter (the supervisor). This mechanism is similar to the interactive transfer of expertise in TEIRESIAS <ref> (Davis, 1979) </ref>. However, the knowledge learned in our system is not in the form of production rules, but in the form of frames and slots for association records. An example of the supervised learning of associations through experience is shown in figure 8.

Reference-contexts: In order to be more specific about the constraints on and output of the learning task, it is necessary to examine the troubleshooting model in more detail.

Reference-contexts: Multistrategy learning systems use a variety of control methods to integrate and combine several learning strategies into a single computer model, providing power and flexibility over a wide range of problems. An alternative approach to flexible learning is exemplified by cognitive architectures such as Soar <ref> (Laird, Rosenbloom, & Newell, 1986) </ref>. Soar takes a broad approach to learning, using a single learning mechanism (chunking), rather than multiple learning strategies to account for learning on different classes of problems.

Reference-contexts: Recently, under the banner of multistrategy learning, there has been much interest in combining or otherwise integrating these and other learning methods in order to address more complex situations than does independent monostrategy learning <ref> (see, e.g., Michalski & Tecuci, 1994) </ref>. Multistrategy learning systems use a variety of control methods to integrate and combine several learning strategies into a single computer model, providing power and flexibility over a wide range of problems.

Reference-contexts: A key to developing computer-based aids is understanding the human problem-solving processes that carry out the complex task of troubleshooting in an assembly line situation. While there has been much interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various areas of electronics manufacturing <ref> (e.g., Miller & Walker, 1988) </ref>, most of this research has not dealt with the issues of learning or cognitive modeling.

Reference-contexts: In this article, we will focus primarily on the learning aspects of the system; however, to provide context, we first describe the problem-solving module of Meta-TS. 2.2 The diagnostic problem-solving module A schematic of the problem-solving system, the troubleshooting module of Meta-TS, is shown in figure 3 <ref> (Narayanan et al., 1992) </ref>. The module takes as input the ICT ticket information and the PCB information. The output of the module is a diagnosis and a set of recommended repair 9 actions. The problem-solving process uses various types of knowledge, troubleshooting actions, and control methods, briefly discussed below. <p> On 84% of these episodes, the model arrived at the same diagnostic result as an operator did in the real world for the same input information; and on 68% of the episodes, similar actions were performed in the solution process <ref> (Narayanan et al., 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Over the past few years, research in machine learning and cognitive science has focused on the development of independent learning algorithms for many classes of these problems. Some of the algorithms that are tailored to particular learning problems include inductive learning (e.g., induction of decision trees <ref> (Quinlan, 1986) </ref>, conceptual clustering (Fisher, 1987; Michalski & Stepp, 1983)), analytical learning (e.g., explanation-based learning (DeJong & Mooney, 1986; Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986), learning from explanation failures (Hall, 1988; VanLehn, Jones, & Chi, 1992)), and analogical learning (e.g., analogy (Falkenhainer, 1989; Gentner, 1989), case-based learning (e.g., Carbonell, 1986; Hammond, 1989)).

Reference-contexts: Meta-AQUA is an introspective multistrategy learning system that improves its ability to understand stories consisting of sequences of descriptions of states and actions performed by characters in the real world. The system is based on the AQUA system <ref> (Ram, 1991, 1993) </ref>, which is a computational model of an active reader. Meta-AQUA uses the same theory of introspective multistrategy learning to allow the system to recover from, and learn from, several types of reasoning failures through an introspective analysis of its performance on the story understanding task. <p> In both AQUA and Meta-AQUA, reading is viewed as an active, goal-driven process in which the reasoning system focuses attention on what it needs to know and attempts to learn by pursuing its goals to acquire information <ref> (Ram, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More research is needed to develop such strategies. 3.2 The introspective multistrategy-learning module Our approach to multistrategy learning is based on the analysis of declarative traces of reasoning processes to determine what and how to learn <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1994) </ref>. A particular troubleshooting episode may involve many different associations, heuristics, and troubleshooting actions.

Reference-contexts: The interaction between Meta-TS and the expert is capable of gathering 19 the relevant associative knowledge. However, the actual mode of communication does not reflect expert-novice interaction in the real world. For example, Meta-TS currently does not model apprenticeship relationships in troubleshooting <ref> (e.g., Redmond, 1992) </ref>. The improvement in system performance from this learning strategy depends on the quality and validity of the expert input. The new knowledge is subject to change, depending on the future episodes encountered by the system.

Reference-contexts: This research was motivated by two considerations. First, although there has been a significant growth of research on machine learning, much of this research has not been performed in the context of complex real-world problem-solving tasks <ref> (cf. Riddle, 1992) </ref>. As a result, the issues of scalability and robustness of these methods, as they are applied to real-world problems, are still unresolved in many cases.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest is psychological research on metamemory which includes, in addition to knowledge about knowledge, knowledge about memory in general and about the peculiarities of one's own memory abilities <ref> (Weinert, 1987) </ref>. The empirical results obtained from the Meta-TS system support the claim that metaknowledge should also include knowledge about 35 reasoning and learning strategies. Experimental results in the metacognition literature suggest that introspective reasoning can facilitate reasoning and learning. <p> Humans often know when they are making progress in problem solving, even if they are far from a solution, and they know when they have sufficiently learned something with respect to some goal <ref> (Weinert, 1987) </ref>. They know how to allocate mental resources and can judge when learning is over. Many of the above reviews (e.g., Chi, 1987; Schneider, 1985; Wellman, 1983) cite evidence for such claims.
