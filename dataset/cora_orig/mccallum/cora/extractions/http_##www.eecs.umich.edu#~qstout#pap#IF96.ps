Abstract: This paper describes algorithms for the design of sequential experiments where extensive switching is undesirable. Given an objective function to minimize by sampling between Bernoulli populations, two different models are considered. The constraint model optimizes the tradeoff of the maximum number of switches vs. the objective function, while the cost model optimizes the tradeoff for the expected number of switches. For each model, an algorithm is developed which produces the optimal sequential experiment. The algorithms are quite general, and give users flexibility in incorporating practical considerations in the design of experiments. To show the usability of these algorithms, they are applied to a bandit problem and an estimation problem. It is observed that the expected number of switches grows approximately as the square root of the sample size, for sample sizes up to a few hundred. It is also observed that one can dramatically reduce the number of switches without substantially affecting the expected value of the objective function. Thus one need sacrifice only a small amount of statistical objective in order to achieve significant gains in practicality.

Reference-contexts: For example, you may need to use a special apparatus to which you have only S accesses. Such cost structures are quite important, although rarely directly incorporated in designs. One exception is in control theory, where the cost structure is as in 1 (see <ref> [1] </ref> and the references therein). Unfortunately, their results apply only when a geometric discount structure is used with an infinite horizon and no terminal objective.

Another analysis of switching costs appears in <ref> [2] </ref>, where the setting is quite specialized with one arm having a known probability of success and the objective is to minimize the expected number of failures.

Reference-contexts: Note that, in both cases, one obtains very high efficiency with relatively few switches. 5.2 Product Estimation The problem of estimating the product of two success probabilities arises in reliability settings, and has been studied several times (see <ref> [3, 5] </ref> and the references a) Expected Number of Switches b) Maximum Number of Switches therein). The objective function is the mean squared error of the terminal estimate of P 1 P 2 , where P i is the success probability of population i.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 concludes with remarks concerning generalizations and observations concerning the results. While no work will be done here on cost alternative 2, note that it can be viewed as a staged-allocation problem, and can be optimized by the techniques developed in <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 Definitions Throughout, we assume that the sample size N is fixed. This assumption merely simplifies our analyses and examples, and the algorithms can easily be adapted to include stopping rules. <p> In particular, work in <ref> [4] </ref> shows that for P = 2, values of S as small as 3 will give very high efficiency on some problems, and this is observed in Section 5.

Reference-contexts: However, fully adaptive designs are rarely used, due to various concerns over their design, analysis, and implementation. In some settings, one concern is that sequential designs switch repeatedly between the alternatives, a design attribute that may be costly or impossible <ref> [6] </ref>.

In a clinical setting, similar setup or training costs may be required to switch between treatment alternatives.
