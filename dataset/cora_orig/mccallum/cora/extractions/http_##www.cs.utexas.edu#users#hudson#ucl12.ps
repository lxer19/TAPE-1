Title: A Logic of Universal Causation  
Author: Hudson Turner 
Date: March 20, 1998  
Address: Austin  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at  
Abstract: For many commonsense reasoning tasks associated with action domains, only a relatively simple kind of causal knowledge is required| knowledge of the conditions under which facts are caused. This note introduces a modal nonmonotonic logic for representing causal knowledge of this kind, relates it to other nonmonotonic formalisms, and shows that a variety of causal theories of action can be expressed in it, including the recently proposed causal action theories of Lin. The new logic extends the causal theories formalism of McCain and Turner, and also provides a more adequate semantic account of it.

Reference-contexts: Geffner employs a modal language with a single modal operator C, read as "explained," and defines "default theories which explicitly accomodate a distinction between `explained' and `unexplained' propositions" <ref> [ Geffner, 1990 ] </ref> . His proposal is meant to enhance "the appeal of preferential entailment as a unifying framework for non-monotonic inference" by contributing to the development of "a general domain-independent criterion for inferring preferences from theories" [ Geffner, 1990 ] . <p> "default theories which explicitly accomodate a distinction between `explained' and `unexplained' propositions" <ref> [ Geffner, 1990 ] </ref> .

The mathematical complexity of Geffner's definitions may reflect the generality of his goal. By comparison, in UCL both aim and means are modest.

Reference-contexts: The language AC uses a slight extension of the definition of possible next states from [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] , allowing for explicitly defined fluents and nondeterministic direct effects of actions. Like its predecessors AR 0 and A <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> , AC is based on the situation calculus [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] .

Reference-contexts: The translation is invertible, so there is a strong sense in which UCL is equivalent to disjunctive default logic, restricted to the special case of complete, consistent extensions. 6.1 Disjunctive Default Logic Here we recall definitions from <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1991 ] </ref> . 14 A disjunctive default rule is an expression of the form ff : fi 1 ; : : : ; fi m (28) where all of ff; fi 1 ; : : : ; fi m ; fl 1 ; : : : ;

Reference-contexts: Typical features of action domain descriptions are easily expressed in UCL. Here are a few examples based on the infamous Yale Shooting domain <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> (as extended by Baker [1991]). One can write Shoot t C:Alive t+1 ^ C:Loaded t+1 (3) to describe the direct effects of shooting: whenever Shoot occurs, both :Alive and :Loaded are caused to hold subsequently.

Reference-contexts: One must define a suitable notion of plan validity, and then devise a method for finding valid plans. In [ McCain and Turner, 1998 ] , we develop such a theoretical framework for planning with causal theories, based in part on the notion of satisfiability planning <ref> [ Kautz and Selman, 1992 ] </ref> . Moreover, we show that an implemented system based on these ideas provides performance comparable to that obtained by Kautz and Selman [1996] on large classical planning problems.

Reference-contexts: See, for example, <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> . 21 Here fi stands for any binary propositional connective. Notice that this definition depends on the finiteness of the UCL theory T , as well as the assumption that the modal operator C is applied only to literals.

Reference-contexts: As we will see in the next section, this is mathematically consistent with the definition of nonpropositional causal theories proposed in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1997 ] </ref> . Moreover, such an approach seems to be necessary in order to catch our intended meaning in the case of first-order quantifiers. For example, consider a language with only a unary predicate symbol P in its signature, where P is not declared exempt. <p> As shown in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1997 ] </ref> , this definition of a causally explained inter pretation extends the definition for propositional causal theories reviewed in Section 4. 12.2 Second-Order Causal Theories in UCL Here we sketch a proof of the following theorem. <p> My deep thanks to my PhD advisor, Vladimir Lifschitz, who helped guide and refine my efforts. Special thanks also to Enrico Giunchiglia for helpful discussions. This work was partially supported by NSF grant IRI-9306751. 6 In <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1997 ] </ref> , the notion of "definite" causal theories is extended to the non-propositional case. If only first-order formulas occur in a definite nonpropositional causal theory, it can be translated into a first-order theory of comparable size. 40

Reference-contexts: Here we describe some of these. In [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] , we gave a uniform account of ramification and qualification constraints (cf. <ref> [ Lin and Reiter, 1994 ] </ref> ), using inference rules to express static causal laws.

Reference-contexts: A fluent literal is a fluent atom or its negation. A fluent formula is a propositional combination of fluent atoms. 5.2 L (F; A; T) Domain Descriptions We illustrate the approach by formalizing a slight elaboration of an action domain from <ref> [ Lin, 1995 ] </ref> in which there is a suitcase with two latches, each of which may be in either of two positions, up or down. The suitcase is spring-loaded so that whenever both latches are in the up position the suitcase is caused to be open. <p> In general, when the preconditions for executability of actions are not explicitly given, the mathematics of Poss can be rather complex, as hinted at in footnote 5 of <ref> [ Lin, 1995 ] </ref> . Even when action preconditions are given explicitly, as is required in the translation of AC into default logic in [ Turner, 1997 ] , the additional predicate and associated axioms complicate the theory. <p> The next few observations help characterize the relationship between Lin formulas as specified here and the kinds of circumscriptive action theories described in <ref> [ Lin, 1995 ] </ref> . Assume that is a fluent designating formula, A is an action name, F is a fluent name, and V is either &gt; or ?. <p> ; V ) : (62) His "explicit precondition" axioms correspond to schemas of the form Holds (A t ) Holds ( t ) : (63) His "qualification state constraint" axioms correspond to schemas of the form Holds ( t ) : (64) For example, consider again the Suitcase domain from <ref> [ Lin, 1995 ] </ref> . We'll use almost the same L (F; A; T) language as in Section 5.2, but restrict time to a finite initial segment of the natural numbers. <p> By Lemma 3, M (I; S [ S 0 ) j= D. Since M (I; S) is a model of CIRC [ D : Caused ], we can conclude that M (I; S [ S 0 ) = M (I; S). Contradiction. 2 27 9.3 Discussion In <ref> [ Lin, 1995 ] </ref> , Lin briefly discusses the possibility of using a more general form of "causal rule" axiom (62), in which Caused can occur negatively any number of times in a sentence, in addition to the one positive occurrence.

Reference-contexts: In a subsequent paper <ref> [ Lin, 1996 ] </ref> , Lin investigates how to extend his circumscriptive action theories to accomodate nondeterministic actions. For our purposes, the first thing to observe is that nondeterministic actions can often be described using the natural counterpart to the approach from Section 5.3.2.

Reference-contexts: We go on to develop in some detail the close relationship between such causal laws and the circumscriptive approach to "causal laws" of Lin [1995]. Along the same lines, we show that the "static causal laws" of <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> correspond to UCL formulas of the form C C : (7) The contributions of this note can be summarized as follows. It introduces UCL, a mathematically simple modal nonmonotonic logic designed for representing commonsense knowledge about actions. <p> Here we describe some of these. In <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> , we gave a uniform account of ramification and qualification constraints (cf. [ Lin and Reiter, 1994 ] ), using inference rules to express static causal laws. <p> This definition of "possible next states" is given by a fixpoint condition that can be seen to reflect the principle of universal causation, understood in a less general fashion. Here we recall the definition from <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> , beginning with a few preliminary definitions. Consider a propositional language in which the atoms are fluent names. Intuitively, an interpretation of this language represents a state of the world. <p> This result shows that the static causal laws from <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> correspond to UCL formulas of the form C C (32) where and are nonmodal formulas. Similarly, UCL formulas of the form C (33) where is nonmodal, correspond to traditional ramification constraints. <p> An interpretation S 0 is a minimal-change update of S by if and only if S 0 is causally explained by the UCL theory fL CL : L 2 Sg [ fC : 2 g : (34) This follows immediately from Propositions 2 and 3 in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> , along with Corollary 1 above. <p> The language AC uses a slight extension of the definition of possible next states from <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> , allowing for explicitly defined fluents and nondeterministic direct effects of actions. Like its predecessors AR 0 and A [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] , AC is based on the situation calculus [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] .

Reference-contexts: The first assumption is unremarkable. The second is not. As in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , we call it the principle of universal causation. This simplifying assumption is the key to the main semantic definition of the logic, which is therefore named for it. <p> In this note we consider the relationship of UCL to only a few of these proposals. As described previously, UCL can be understood as an extension of the causal theories approach of <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , where Norman McCain and the current author introduced so-called "causal laws" of the form ) , with the intended reading "whenever is true, is caused to be true." Here we show that such causal laws can be translated in UCL as C (6) thus <p> Finally, it relates UCL to some well-known nonmonotonic formalisms. We proceed as follows. Section 2 defines propositional UCL, the fragment primarily investigated in this note. Section 3 presents preliminary examples. Section 4 shows that UCL extends the causal theories formalism of <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , and Section 5 describes the general method of formalizing action domains inherited from that paper. <p> Moreover, it is not difficult to verify that T 0 is a conservative extension of T : that is, T and T 0 have the same UCL-consequences (and, in fact, the same S5-consequences) in the language of T . 4 Causal Theories in UCL In <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , we defined a mathematically simple non-monotonic formalism, called the language of causal theories, together with a general method of formalizing action domains as causal theories. <p> <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , we defined a mathematically simple non-monotonic formalism, called the language of causal theories, together with a general method of formalizing action domains as causal theories. Here we show that UCL subsumes the causal theories formalism, and thus inherits the action formalization method from [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] . 4.1 The Language of Causal Theories Here we reproduce the central definitions from [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] . A causal law is an expression of the form ) (12) where and are (nonmodal) formulas. <p> Here we show that UCL subsumes the causal theories formalism, and thus inherits the action formalization method from <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . 4.1 The Language of Causal Theories Here we reproduce the central definitions from [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] . A causal law is an expression of the form ) (12) where and are (nonmodal) formulas. By a causal theory we mean a set of causal laws. We emphasize that (12) is not the material conditional . <p> By Lemma 1, (I; fI; I 0 g) j= ucl (D). It follows that I = I 0 , so I is the unique model of D I . 2 5 Causal Theories of Action in UCL By Theorem 1, UCL inherits the general approach to action formalization from <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . <p> We have also established, by means of Theorems 1 and 4, the remarkable similarity between the action theories of Lin and the causal theories of action of <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . Moreover, in light of this, Theorem 2 and Proposition 5 show how such causal action theories can also be expressed in default logic|as "prerequisite-free" default theories|and in autoepistemic logic. <p> These are the UCL theories that correspond to so-called "definite" causal theories, as introduced in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . 6 For UCL theories of this kind, automated query answering can be carried out simply by translating them into classical logic and then using standard tools.

Reference-contexts: More interesting are those facts that, roughly speaking, are true simply because they were true before and haven't been made false since. It is facts of this kind that give rise to the frame problem <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> . Solutions to the frame problem typically appeal to the "commonsense law of inertia," according to which the value of an inertial fluent persists unless it is caused to change. <p> Like its predecessors AR 0 and A [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] , AC is based on the situation calculus <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> . When actions are not always executable, situation calculus theories must include an additional predicate|typically named Poss|that characterizes when it is possible to perform an action in a situation, and when a situation can be reached by a sequence of actions.

UCL differs in fundamental ways from nonmonotonic formalisms such as default logic [ Reiter, 1980 ] and autoepistemic logic <ref> [ Moore, 1985 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The rewards would be minimal, given the differences in emphasis, and in mathematical machinery. It appears that Geffner's proposal was inspired by Judea Pearl's investigation of the distinction between causal and non-causal grounds in general 4 default reasoning and probabilistic reasoning, as developed in <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> and many subsequent publications. Consideration of the relationship of UCL to this body of work is beyond the scope of this note.

Reference-contexts: In a similar vein, it is clear that a nonmodal formula , if added to (34) or (31), would act as a qualification constraint (again in the sense of Lin and 18 Reiter [1994]), simply eliminating the causally explained interpretations that fail to satisfy the constraint . In <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , a high-level action language AC was defined, in the manner of the action language AR 0 of Kartha and Lifschitz [1994], and an embedding into default logic was established. <p> Even when action preconditions are given explicitly, as is required in the translation of AC into default logic in <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , the additional predicate and associated axioms complicate the theory. <p> Instead, if an action can be performed in a situation, there will be, roughly speaking, some causally possible world in which it actually is. 3 For this reason, we find it convenient to suppress the role of the situation calculus when we describe the action theories from <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . We will do the same when we consider in Section 9 the causal action theories of Lin [1995, 1996]. In [ Turner, 1997 ] , inertia is expressed by default rules that, in light of Theorem 2, correspond (essentially) to the UCL schemas Cf t ^ <p> actually is. 3 For this reason, we find it convenient to suppress the role of the situation calculus when we describe the action theories from <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . We will do the same when we consider in Section 9 the causal action theories of Lin [1995, 1996]. In [ Turner, 1997 ] , inertia is expressed by default rules that, in light of Theorem 2, correspond (essentially) to the UCL schemas Cf t ^ f t+1 Cf t+1 (35) where f is a metavariable ranging over fluent names. <p> Here again we see a negative occurrence of C. Notice that formula (37) is an S5-consequence of t C 0 t , whose form corresponds to that of the static causal laws in Section 5.2. The formalizations of action domains as default theories in <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> , along with Theorem 2, suggests the following alternative UCL formalization of Lin's Suitcase domain. We begin with four domain specific schemas, where l is metavariable ranging over fL 1 ; L 2 g.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, UCL formulas of the form C (33) where is nonmodal, correspond to traditional ramification constraints. Here we validate this claim with respect to Winslett's classic, minimal-change definition of theory update <ref> [ Winslett, 1988 ] </ref> , which can be stated as follows. Let be a set of formulas. Let S and S 0 be interpretations.
