Abstract: 1 Overview of Result We present a new polynomial time algorithm that computes a subgraph of the exact minimum weight triangulation of a set of points. The subgraph contains more edges than previously known subgraphs [6, 4, 1]. In fact, it is been tested on many hundreds of uniformly distributed random point sets containing up to 220 points and in every instance has produced a connected subgraph. We are therefore able to compute the exact minimum weight triangulation of these general point set in polynomial (worst case O(n 6 )) time. A minimum weight triangulation of a point set S is a triangulation that minimizes weight over all possible triangulations. Since two distinct triangulations may have the same weight, we denote any one minimum weight triangulation of S as M W T (S), and the graph containing all edges in every minimum weight triangulation as mwt(S). The minimum weight triangulation problem (M W T ) is: for a given input set S, find any M W T (S). Though it has been shown how to compute a M W T (P ) in time O(n 3 ) when P is a simple polygon [5], the complexity status of the M W T problem for a general point set is unknown. In particular, there are no known polynomial time algorithms to compute the M W T for a general point set. However if a complete connected subgraph M W T (S) of M W T (S) can be found, then the method of [5] can be extended to compute M W T (S) by adding to M W T (S) the convex hull and treating the result as a simple polygon (or collection of simple polygons). Several recent investigations have reported on certain probable subgraphs of mwt(S). A trivial example is the convex hull of S, which is a subgraph of any triangulation of S. Gilbert [3] showed that the shortest possible 2. Cheng and Xu [1] have recently claimed that Kiel's result can be tightened to show the fi-skeleton is a subgraph of mwt(S) for the smaller value of fi = 1:17682 (producing a larger number of known mwt edges than fi = These subgraphs are particularly interesting in light of another recent result. It was shown by Cheng, Golin and Tsang [2] that if a subgraph of mwt(S) with k connected components is given, then the complete M W T (S) can be computed in O(n k+2 ) time. The fi-skeleton itself requires only O(n log n) time to compute. While these results are interesting, unfortunately the subgraphs presented are in general not connected even for relatively small sets of uniformly distributed points. As an example, [2] gives a sample fi-skeleton of only n = 50 points for fi = 1:17682. When the convex hull is added, the resulting graph still has three connected components. Thus for point sets of approximately 50 points, the algorithm of [2] typically runs in O(n 5 ) time. Note, that a slight permutation of the input set could dramatically increase asymptotic running time. And for sets even as small as 200 points, our empirical data showed that the fi-skeleton for fi = 1:17682 typically has approximately 15 connected components, and thus to complete the exact M W T (S)requires O(n 17 ) time. In contrast to these skeletons, we present a new subgraph of mwt(S). Our subgraph requires O(n 6 ) time to compute in the worst case, but for uniformly distributed points appears to run in only O(n 4 log n) time. Empircal tests have shown that our subgraph, while being more costly to compute than the fi-skeleton, contains substantially more edges. In fact, in hundreds of trials on sets of up to 220 points in uniform random distributions, our subgraph has been connected in every instance. We present that subgraph, and the algorithm to produce it. p
