Abstract: Qualitative spatial reasoning has many applications in such diverse areas as natural language understanding, cognitive mapping, and reasoning about the physical world. We address problems whose solutions require integrated spatial and dynamic reasoning. In this paper, we present our spatial representation, based on the extremal points of objects, and show that this representation is useful for modeling the spatial extent, relative positions, and orientation of objects, and in reasoning about changes in spatial relations and orientation due to the translational and rotational motion of objects. Our theory has been implemented to support a magnetic fields problem solving application using the QPC and QSIM systems for qualitative modeling. The issues encountered in integrating spatial and dynamic reasoning in the context of these systems are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: A fundamental starting point for spatial reasoning is the representation of the spatial extent of an object. Problems which require knowledge of the exact shapes of objects, such as determining whether two gears will mesh together, will require a numerically precise spatial representation, such as the configuration space <ref> [Forbus, et. al. 91, Joskowicz and Sacks 91] </ref>. For many problems, knowledge of the approximate extent of objects is sufficient, or that could be only information available.

Reference-contexts: We encountered two difficulties in integrating spatial and dynamic reasoning in the context of these systems the need to model piecewise continuous variables, and the need to model variables with circular quantity spaces. Modeling Piecewise Continuous Variables Several qualitative modeling tools, such as QPC and QPE <ref> [Forbus 90] </ref>, require model variables to be continuous. In problems involving both spatial and dynamic reasoning, it's possible for certain model variables to be piecewise-continuous. Figure 1 shows a conducting loop, whose abstracted shape is a rectangle, moving into a rectangular field.

Reference-contexts: Modeling Spatial Extent We describe the spatial extent of an object qualitatively in terms of its extremal points: the topmost (tm), rightmost (rm), bottommost (bm), and leftmost (lm) points <ref> [Rajagopalan 93] </ref>. To reason about three dimensional objects, we add the frontmost and rearmost points. We use two abstractions, a rectangular bounding box drawn around the extremal points of an object, and a bounding circle, as described below, to approximate the region occupied by the object.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we are implementing a magnetic fields problem solver, which, given a diagram to describe the initial spatial state and text to describe any dynamic changes taking place, solves the problem through qualitative simulation. An input processing specialist, The Figure Un-derstander <ref> [Rajagopalan and Kuipers 94] </ref>, is used to integrate the information in the text and diagram input into a unified model of the initial state.
