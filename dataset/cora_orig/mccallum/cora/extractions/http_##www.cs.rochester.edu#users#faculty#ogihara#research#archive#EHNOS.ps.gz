This proves the theorem. 2 Amir, Beigel and Gasarch <ref> [ABG] </ref> showed that there is a 1-cheatable set that is not p-selective, and, conversely, that there are p-selective sets that are not cheatable. Using our methods of constructing p-selective sets, the following theorem gives an improvement of their latter result.

Reference-contexts: We assume readers are familiar with interactive proof systems <ref> [GMR89, Bab85] </ref> and with multiprover interactive proof systems [BOGKW88]. In [BBFG91, BG94] the authors consider competitive proof systems. An interactive proof system for a language L is competitive if the honest prover is a probabilistic polynomial time oracle Turing machine that accesses the language L.

Reference-contexts: Under a reasonable assumption about exponential time (NE 6= E), we construct a language in NP for which search reduces to decision, but that is not self-reducible. Balcazar <ref> [Bal90] </ref> has demonstrated that search reduces to decision for a set L if and only if L is a self-1-helper, a notion defined by Ko [Ko87]. As a consequence, our result solves the principal open question in [Ko87]. <p> Schoning defined an oracle Turing machine M to be robust if for every oracle A, the language accepted by M A is the same [Sch85]. Ko [Ko87] used this notion to define the notion of self-1-helpers. In <ref> [Bal90] </ref>, Balcazar proved that a set L 2 NP is a self-1-helper if and only if search reduces to decision for L. 1 [BD76] requires Equation 2 to hold for all R and p that define L. 2 We can show that reducing search to decision by weaker reducibilities such as <p> S;p in polynomial time by any nonadaptive algorithm because any query to R f S;p can be replaced by a query to L. (This depends on the specific property of L and the specific choice of S and p.) Thus, we see that binary search is inherently adaptive. 11 In <ref> [Bal90] </ref>, Balcazar proved that a set L 2 NP is a self-1-helper if and only if search reduces to decision for L. It is easy to show that the equivalence holds for nonadaptiveness also. Thus, we may restate our corollary as a result about self-1-helpers.

Reference-contexts: We say that search reduces to decision for a language L 2 NP if the search problem for L is Turing reducible in polynomial time to L. Beigel et al. <ref> [BBFG91] </ref> provides evidence that search does not reduce to decision for all of NP. It has long been felt that the structural property that causes search to be reducible to decision is disjunctive self-reducibility. <p> We call a prover natural if it is an oracle for L, and we define a natural proof system to be one in which all honest provers are natural. (Natural proof systems are similar to competitive proof systems defined in <ref> [BBFG91, BG94] </ref>.) If a language L has a natural interactive proof system how much interaction is required? We show under the assumption NE 6 BPE that there is a language L 2 NP BPP such that L has a natural proof system but L does not have any 1 round natural <p> For each language L 2 NP and R and p that define L, we define the partial multivalued function f R;p as follows: f R;p (x) 7! y; if jyj = p (jxj) and R (x; y): Clearly, each f R;p belongs to NPMV. Definition 3 <ref> [BD76, BBFG91] </ref> Let L 2 NP. <p> Let us note that the converse does not hold. Let L be a set in NP for which search does not reduce to decision <ref> [BBFG91] </ref>. Then, L L is autoreducible, but search does not reduce to decision for L L. 3.3 On Computing Satisfying Assignments Corollary 1 states under a reasonable assumption that there is a set in NPP for which search does not nonadaptively reduce to decision. <p> We assume readers are familiar with interactive proof systems [GMR89, Bab85] and with multiprover interactive proof systems [BOGKW88]. In <ref> [BBFG91, BG94] </ref> the authors consider competitive proof systems. An interactive proof system for a language L is competitive if the honest prover is a probabilistic polynomial time oracle Turing machine that accesses the language L. We consider a variation of this model. <p> Let compMIP denote the class of languages having competitive multiprover proofs. It is easy to see that NIP (poly; poly) = compMIP. Furthermore, as Beigel et al <ref> [BBFG91] </ref> have observed, compMIP is identical to the class frIP of languages having function-restricted proof systems as defined by Blum and Kannan [BK89] Thus, IV = NIP (poly; poly) = compMIP = frIP. 4.2 Nonadaptive vs. Adaptive Checkers The following definition is due to Blum and Kannan [BK89].

Reference-contexts: For each language L 2 NP and R and p that define L, we define the partial multivalued function f R;p as follows: f R;p (x) 7! y; if jyj = p (jxj) and R (x; y): Clearly, each f R;p belongs to NPMV.

Reference-contexts: In a similar vein, we show that if there is a cheatable set <ref> [Bei87, Bei91] </ref> that is not P m -equivalent to any tally set, then P 6= NP, and we obtain with no assumption, a recursive p-selective tally set that is not cheatable. Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet [BvHT93] have very recently proved that every p-selective self-reducible set belongs to P. <p> By Proposition 1, if T 0 is P tt - reducible to a p-selective language, then T 0 2 P, which contradicts the assumption that T 0 2 UP P. 2 5.2 P-selective and P-cheatable sets The following definitions are due to Beigel <ref> [Bei87, Bei91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Define the infinite sequence w = w 1 w 2 w 3 . 4 Theorem 1 and Proposition 1 also follow as consequences of a result of Beigel <ref> [Bei88] </ref>. 10 Consider the standard left cut L = L (w). Clearly L is p-selective. We need to show that L 2 NP P and that search reduces to decision for L.

Reference-contexts: Disjunctive self-reducibility is the structural property that forms the basis of the work by P. Berman <ref> [Ber78] </ref>, Fortune [For79], Mahaney [Mah82], and others, concerning reductions to sparse sets. An obvious and well-known algorithm with SAT as an oracle uses the disjunctive self-reducibility of SAT in order to compute a satisfying assignment for any satisfiable formula. <p> However, since L is a tally language, it cannot be self-reducible, for that would imply that L 2 P <ref> [Ber78] </ref>. 2 Corollary 4 If UE 6= E, then there exists a language L 2 UP P such that L is a nonadaptive self-1-helper, but L is not self-reducible. Ko defined the following concept of unambiguous 1-helping in [Ko87].

Reference-contexts: Of course, more is known. Let MIP denote the class of languages having multiprover proof systems. Then, MIP = IP (poly; poly) = NEXP = IP (2; 1), by the results of Babai, Fortnow, and Lund <ref> [BFL91] </ref> and Feige and Lovasz [FL92]. Next we show that a trade-off between number of rounds and number of provers cannot be accomplished even if a polynomial number of provers are allowed. Theorem 8 If L is p-selective and L belongs to NIP (poly; const), then L is in BPP.

Reference-contexts: We call a prover natural if it is an oracle for L, and we define a natural proof system to be one in which all honest provers are natural.

Reference-contexts: We use our techniques to obtain their conclusion, and simultaneously a language that is not self-reducible, with the weaker hypothesis that NE 6 BPE. We prove that if UE " co-UE 6 BPE, then there exists a language L 2 NP that is checkable <ref> [BK89] </ref> but is not nonadaptively checkable. Lastly, we consider the natural extension of "search reduces to decision for L" to interactive proof systems. <p> Let compMIP denote the class of languages having competitive multiprover proofs. It is easy to see that NIP (poly; poly) = compMIP. Furthermore, as Beigel et al [BBFG91] have observed, compMIP is identical to the class frIP of languages having function-restricted proof systems as defined by Blum and Kannan <ref> [BK89] </ref> Thus, IV = NIP (poly; poly) = compMIP = frIP. 4.2 Nonadaptive vs. Adaptive Checkers The following definition is due to Blum and Kannan [BK89]. <p> Beigel et al [BBFG91] have observed, compMIP is identical to the class frIP of languages having function-restricted proof systems as defined by Blum and Kannan <ref> [BK89] </ref> Thus, IV = NIP (poly; poly) = compMIP = frIP. 4.2 Nonadaptive vs. Adaptive Checkers The following definition is due to Blum and Kannan [BK89].

Reference-contexts: In a similar vein, we show that if there is a cheatable set [Bei87, Bei91] that is not P m -equivalent to any tally set, then P 6= NP, and we obtain with no assumption, a recursive p-selective tally set that is not cheatable. Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet <ref> [BvHT93] </ref> have very recently proved that every p-selective self-reducible set belongs to P. Their result gives us an added bonus. <p> That is, we obtain a set in NP P for which search reduces to decision but that is not disjunctive self-reducible by exhibiting a p-selective set in NP P for which search reduces to decision. By applying the result in <ref> [BvHT93] </ref>, we immediately obtain the stronger claim that there is a set in NP P for which search reduces to decision and that is not self-reducible at all. Throughout this paper, we will make the stronger claim whenever possible. The next section presents notation and definitions. <p> Nonadaptive random self-reduction is a special case of an adaptive random self-reduction, where the queries to the oracle are restricted to be nonadaptive. P-selective sets have been the focus of many researchers, <ref> [Sel79, Ko83, Tod91, BvHT93] </ref>, and they form the basis of our work. This property was defined by Selman in [Sel79]. <p> is p-selective with selector f (x; y) = minfx; yg. 3 On Self-Reducibilities 3.1 "Self-reducible" vs. "search reduces to decision" Selman showed in [Sel79] that a set L is disjunctive self-reducible and p-selective if and only if L 2 P, and Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet improved this by showing <ref> [BvHT93] </ref> that a set L is self-reducible and p-selective if and only if L 2 P. We obtain a similar characterization of P using sets for which search nonadaptively reduces to decision. <p> It follows immediately from Theorem 1 and <ref> [BvHT93] </ref> that if E 6= NE, then there is a set L 2 NP P that is not self-reducible and for which search does not nonadaptively reduce to decision. (This is so because it is known [Sel79] that E 6= NE implies the existence of a p-selective set in NP P.) <p> The corollary follows by Theorem 2, using <ref> [BvHT93] </ref> together with Theorem 1. Corollary 2 If NE 6= co-NE, then there exists a set L in NP co-NP such that search reduces to decision for L, search does not nonadaptively reduce to decision for L, and L is not self-reducible. <p> All the well known examples of self-reducible sets in NP [Mah82, MP79, Sel88] are actually disjunctive self-reducible sets. In light of the results of Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet <ref> [BvHT93] </ref>, it is reasonable to inquire whether NP contains sets that are self-reducible but not disjunctive self-reducible. The following theorem gives an affirmative answer to this question, thereby adding import to their work. <p> If q fl 2 L, then accept, else reject. Thus L 2 P, which is a contradiction, which completes the proof. 2 In <ref> [BvHT93] </ref>, it is shown that if search reduces to decision for a language L 2 NP, then L is autoreducible [Tra70]. Let us note that the converse does not hold. Let L be a set in NP for which search does not reduce to decision [BBFG91].

Reference-contexts: There is no analogue to Corollary 7 when the computational power of provers is unrestricted, for every language in PSPACE has a 1 prover polynomial-round interactive proof system [LFKN92, Sha92] and every language in PSPACE can be accepted by 2 provers in 1 round <ref> [CCL94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, the assertion "NPMV c PF" means that every partial multivalued function in NPMV has a refinement that can be computed efficiently by some deterministic polynomial time transducer. Notions of polynomial time Turing reducibility between partial multivalued functions are defined in <ref> [Sel94, FHOS93] </ref>. Here we need only the following special case. Let M be a deterministic oracle Turing machine transducer that accesses a set as its oracle. Given a set L, let M [L] denote the single-valued partial function that M computes with oracle L.

Reference-contexts: We raise the question, how much interaction does a natural proof system require? We will show under plausible complexity theoretic assumption that there are languages in NP that require a polynomial number of rounds even if multiple provers are allowed. Following <ref> [FRS88] </ref>, let IP (j; k) be the class of languages accepted with no more than j provers in no more than k rounds. Let poly designate a polynomial. Let NIP (j; k) be the corresponding class of languages accepted by natural interactive proof systems. Let const designate a constant. <p> Thus, as a consequence of Proposition 2, if L is any language in NP BPP for which search reduces to decision, then L belongs to NIP (1; poly) NIP (const; const). This observation stands in contrast to <ref> [FRS88] </ref> in which they show that IP (poly; poly) = IP (3; 2). Of course, more is known. Let MIP denote the class of languages having multiprover proof systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, there is no trade-off between number of rounds and number of provers. Let us say a few words here about our techniques, for, as it turns out, this paper is also about p-selective sets <ref> [Sel79] </ref>. It has been known that a set L belongs to P if and only if it is both p-selective and disjunctive self-reducible. <p> This requires new methods for constucting p-selective sets. The only known method for constucting p-selective sets has been the standard left cut construction <ref> [Sel79, Sel82a] </ref>. <p> Nonadaptive random self-reduction is a special case of an adaptive random self-reduction, where the queries to the oracle are restricted to be nonadaptive.

This property was defined by Selman in <ref> [Sel79] </ref>. Definition 6 A set L is p-selective if there exists a polynomial time computable function f : fl fi fl 7! fl such that (i) f (x; y) 2 fx; yg, and (ii) if f (x; y) = y, then x 2 L ! y 2 L. <p> A string z with this property is called a "pivot" string. For r 2 fl [ ! , the standard left cut of r <ref> [Sel79, Sel82b] </ref> is the set L (r) = fx 2 + j x &lt; rg; where &lt; is the ordinary dictionary ordering of strings with 0 less than 1. <p> For example, the string 001 is less than the string 10 in dictionary ordering but not in lexicographic ordering.) It is obvious that every standard left cut is p-selective with selector f (x; y) = minfx; yg. 3 On Self-Reducibilities 3.1 "Self-reducible" vs. "search reduces to decision" Selman showed in <ref> [Sel79] </ref> that a set L is disjunctive self-reducible and p-selective if and only if L 2 P, and Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet improved this by showing [BvHT93] that a set L is self-reducible and p-selective if and only if L 2 P. <p> It follows immediately from Theorem 1 and [BvHT93] that if E 6= NE, then there is a set L 2 NP P that is not self-reducible and for which search does not nonadaptively reduce to decision. (This is so because it is known <ref> [Sel79] </ref> that E 6= NE implies the existence of a p-selective set in NP P.) However, a stronger assertion than this will follow from the following theorem. Theorem 2 If NE 6= E, then there exists a p-selective set L 2 NP P for which search reduces to decision. <p> To show that L is not nonadaptively checkable, it suffices, by Theorem 9, to note that L is p-selective. 2 5 More about P-selective Sets 5.1 P-Selective Sets, Standard Left Cuts, and Tally Lan guages The classical method for constructing p-selective sets is the standard left cut construction of <ref> [Sel79, Sel82b] </ref>. One basic property of a standard left cut is that every nonempty standard left cut has a nonempty intersection with n for all but finitely many n.

The only known method for constucting p-selective sets has been the standard left cut construction <ref> [Sel79, Sel82a] </ref>. <p> This completes the proof of Theorem 11. 2 It is known that for every standard left cut L (r), there exists a tally language T , such that L (r) P ptt T , and T P T L (r) <ref> [Sel82a] </ref>. As an immediate corollary, this holds for all p-selective sets if P = PP. <p> This completes the proof of the theorem. 2 26 Whereas for every tally set T , there exists a standard left cut L (r) such that T P T L (r) <ref> [Sel82a] </ref>, it is shown in [HHO + 93] that there exists a tally set T that is not P tt -reducible to any p-selective set.

Reference-contexts: Nonadaptive random self-reduction is a special case of an adaptive random self-reduction, where the queries to the oracle are restricted to be nonadaptive. P-selective sets have been the focus of many researchers, <ref> [Sel79, Ko83, Tod91, BvHT93] </ref>, and they form the basis of our work. This property was defined by Selman in [Sel79]. <p> Given any p-selector f (for some p-selective set), every finite set Q can be ordered by f in time a polynomial in the sum of the lengths of the strings in Q. We will use the following lemma, proved by Toda in <ref> [Tod91] </ref>. Lemma 1 Let L be a p-selective set with p-selector f , and let Q fl be a finite set.

Reference-contexts: If q fl 2 L, then accept, else reject. Thus L 2 P, which is a contradiction, which completes the proof. 2 In [BvHT93], it is shown that if search reduces to decision for a language L 2 NP, then L is autoreducible <ref> [Tra70] </ref>. Let us note that the converse does not hold. Let L be a set in NP for which search does not reduce to decision [BBFG91].

Reference-contexts: Thus, the following corollary follows immediately. Corollary 6 There exists an oracle A such that sat A 62 c (PF A ) NP A tt . This result stands in contrast to a result of Watanabe and Toda <ref> [WT93] </ref>, which states that sat 2 PF NP tt holds relative to a random oracle. 15 4 Adaptiveness in Random Reductions In [FFLS92], it is shown that NEEE 6 BPEEE implies that there exist sets in NP P that are randomly self-reducible, but not nonadaptively randomly self-reducible.
