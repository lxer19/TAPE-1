Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the traffic models that have been designed and built for the ATM-TN TeleSim Project. A brief description of each of the three traffic models (an MPEG compressed video model, an aggregate Ethernet LAN traffic model, and an Internet mosaic session model) is presented, including the purpose, the design methodology, and the parameters for each model. All three models have been implemented in SimKit, a C ++ -based simulation interface built on top of Shared Memory TimeWarp (SMTW), which provides an environment for efficient parallel simulation. Preliminary performance results for the sequential implementations of the three traffic models are now available, and are reported in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The MPEG video model is designed to model this compressed video traffic. The Ethernet LAN traffic model is designed to model the aggregate data packet traffic generated across an ATM backbone network connecting campus-area LANs. The Internet mosaic model is designed to capture the workload characteristics of mosaic <ref> (Andreessen 1993) </ref>, an application that is the fastest-growing consumer of bandwidth on the NSFNET backbone (NSFNET 1995). Each of the three workload models has its own specific workload characteristics and parameters. <p> A more complete description of the Ethernet traffic model is contained in a separate paper elsewhere in this conference proceedings (Chen et al. 1995). 3.3 Internet Mosaic Traffic Model The Internet mosaic traffic model is designed to represent the wide area network traffic generated by users of mosaic <ref> (Andreessen 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Parallel execution is supported by a lower layer called WarpKit, which interfaces directly to Shared Memory TimeWarp (SMTW) <ref> (Fujimoto 1989) </ref>. These lower layers deal with the assignment of logical processes to processors, event scheduling, state saving, and other technical issues related to parallel execution. The target hardware platform for ATM-TN is a 14-processor SGI Power Challenger at the University of Calgary.

Reference-contexts: Self-similarity has been observed in video traffic <ref> (Garrett and Willinger 1994) </ref> and wide area Internet traffic (Paxson and Floyd 1994) as well. Self-similar Ethernet traffic has been modeled using the TES (Melamed 1992; Geist and Melamed 1992) modeling methodology.

Reference-contexts: The resulting cross-correlation between frame sizes increases the accuracy of the model (Melamed 1992; Gar-rett and Willinger 1994). Thus the final MPEG model is a composite TES model. The model has been parameterized based on empirical studies of MPEG sequences (i.e., using MPEG data provided with testool <ref> (Geist and Melamed 1992) </ref>). The final MPEG model has four parameters: (1) the GOP structure of the MPEG stream; (2) a scaling factor for the average bit rate; (3) the frame rate for the displayed video; and (4) a smoothing parameter for shaping the video source.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Workload modeling is a vital component of any simulation study <ref> (Jain 1991) </ref>. Outputs from a simulation model are highly dependent on the inputs provided to the model, and without realistic input workload models, the simulation results are of little value.

Reference-contexts: implementation of each of these three models. 3.1 MPEG Video Traffic Model The MPEG video traffic model in ATM-TN is designed to model the unidirectional transmission of a single variable bit rate compressed video stream in an ATM network, where the video source is compressed according to the MPEG standard <ref> (LeGall 1991) </ref>. MPEG defines a standardized method for compressing full-motion video for storage as digital data. For viewing, this data is transmitted over a network as an MPEG stream and decoded at its destination.

Reference-contexts: An entire GOP is generated at a time, and then buffered for simulated transmission according to the other traffic parameters. 3.2 Ethernet LAN Traffic Model The Ethernet LAN traffic model is designed to represent the self-similar workload characteristics <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref> of aggregate data packet traffic on existing local area networks, such as campus LANs. Self-similarity has been observed in video traffic (Garrett and Willinger 1994) and wide area Internet traffic (Paxson and Floyd 1994) as well.

Reference-contexts: An example of a typical MPEG sequence is IBBPBBPBBIBBPBBPBBI: : : , where the GOP pattern is IBBPBBPBB. Significant correlations (i.e., autocorrelation and cross-correlation) have been observed in the sizes of the MPEG frames in a video sequence <ref> (Pancha and El Zarki 1994) </ref>. In the TeleSim project, the MPEG video sources are modeled using the Transform-Expand-Sample (TES) modeling methodology established by Melamed et al. (Melamed 1992; Geist and Melamed 1992). TES provides a fast method to generate autocorrelated time series.
