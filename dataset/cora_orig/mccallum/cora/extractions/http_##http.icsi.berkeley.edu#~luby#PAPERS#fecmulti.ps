Abstract: Developing scalable, reliable multicast protocols for lossy networks presents an array of challenges. In this work we focus on scheduling policies which determine what data the sender places into each sent packet. Our objective is to develop scalable policies which provably deliver a long intact prefix of the message to each receiver at each point in time during the transmission. To accurately represent conditions in existing networks, our theoretical model of the network allows bursty periods of packet loss which can vary widely and arbitrarily over time. Under this general model, we give a proof that there is an inherent performance gap between algorithms which use encoding schemes such as forward error correction (FEC) and those which do not. We then present simple, feedback-free policies which employ FEC and have guaranteed worst-case performance. Our analytic results are complemented by trace-driven simulations which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practice.

Reference-contexts: The benefits of this decomposition are twofold: it encourages the design of simpler, more modular protocols, and it allows us to study data selection policies in isolation, with 1 out the complicating influence of external factors. Further justification for this separation is provided in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. An important consideration regarding these policies is the scalability of transmitting to large multicast groups. In particular, the problem of feedback implosion arises when a large set of receivers attempt to acknowledge or (negatively acknowledge) receipt of a packet. <p> The worst case is taken over all points in time during the transmission and over all transcripts of network behavior. In this model, we develop scalable multicast data selection policies which perform provably well for these prefix measures. The work of <ref> [1] </ref> considered the performance of adaptive, retransmission-based prefix protocols for point-to-point connections. In this work, we consider performance of feedback-free prefix protocols for multicast connections. The use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) has recently seen wider use in proposals to improve reliability in higher level protocols.
