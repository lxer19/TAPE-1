Abstract: Modular fabrication of polysilicon surface-micromachined structures after completion of a conventional CMOS electronic process is described. Key process steps include tungsten metallization with contact diffusion barriers, LPCVD oxide and nitride passivation of the CMOS, rapid thermal processing for stress-relief annealing of the structural polysilicon film, implementation of a sacrificial spin-on-glass planarization, and the final microstructure release in hydrofluoric acid. Modularity of the process enables independant modification of either the CMOS or the microstructure process sequences. This technology is used in the fabrication of various types of sensors and actuators. Polycrystalline silicon micromechanical structures have been a focus of academic research for more than a decade with increasing commercial developments over the past few years. These micros-tructures are fabricated by selective etching of an underlying oxide sacrificial layer, a process known as "surface micromachining." Illustrated in figure 1, this process relies on the sequential deposition of a sacrificial layer, in this case phosphosilicate glass, and a phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon structural material. The structural layer is anchored to the substrate by vias etched through the glass. Repeating this sequence can yield stacked structures consisting of more than one structural layer. The

Reference-contexts: Alternatives to this approach have been investigated in which aluminum [Hornbeck (1993)], tungsten [Chen et al. (1993)], or silicon nitride [Albrecht et al. <ref> (1990) </ref>] have been used as the mechanical material. These techniques may also employ alternative sacrificial materials, such as the polymers used in the aluminum process just mentioned. <p> The primary technology-design question is: in what order to build the the sensor and the electronics? Surface-micromachined structures can be defined prior to circuit fabrication, afterwards as a post-circuit module, or interleaved with thin film layers possibly used for both circuits and microstructures [Yun et al. <ref> (1990) </ref>]. The first alternative is undesirable because the large relief of sensor devices make subsequent circuit lithography difficult unless major planarization efforts are made. <p> Multiple coating with hot plate curing was necessary to achieve an adequate thickness to planarize the MEMS structures. The four step process as implemented consisted of a thin LPCVD PSG interdielectric layer in order to cover the exposed polysilicon (SP2), two coats of hot plate cured SOG <ref> (one minute each at 90 C, 150 C, and 250 C) </ref>, a 60 min. furnace cure at 425 C in nitrogen, and an isotropic SF 6 plasma etchback.

Reference-contexts: The final fabrication step involves a release etch, in this case in hydrofluoric acid, to remove the underlying sacrificial glass; which results in free-standing polysilicon structures capable of vertical or lateral motion. Alternatives to this approach have been investigated in which aluminum [Hornbeck <ref> (1993) </ref>], tungsten [Chen et al. (1993)], or silicon nitride [Albrecht et al. (1990)] have been used as the mechanical material. These techniques may also employ alternative sacrificial materials, such as the polymers used in the aluminum process just mentioned. <p> The final fabrication step involves a release etch, in this case in hydrofluoric acid, to remove the underlying sacrificial glass; which results in free-standing polysilicon structures capable of vertical or lateral motion.

These techniques may also employ alternative sacrificial materials, such as the polymers used in the aluminum process just mentioned. <p> Interleaving the two technologies is feasible, was first demonstrated with NMOS in 1984 [Howe and Muller (1984)], and is being used to fabricate an integrated accelerometer for air-bag deployment [Core et al. <ref> (1993) </ref>]. Advantages of the post-circuit sensor fabrication model are that circuit areas can be fully passivated prior to initiating sensor construction and that microstructures can be fabricated on top of the interface electronics to minimize chip area. <p> We have chosen to call the modularization of CMOS and microstructures the MICS technology. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabricated using this modularized MICS technology include an accelerometer [Yun et al. (1992)], a resonator oscillator [Nguyen and Howe <ref> (1993) </ref>], and an integrated test-bed with multi-mode position control [Fedder and Howe (1994)]. 2.0 MICS Technology Overview MICS technology. The 3 mm, double-polysilicon, single metal, P-well CMOS technology is fabricated as a baseline module. <p> As-deposited in situ phosphorus-doped films that generally nucleate in the crystalline phase at deposition temperatures of 610 C do not satisfy these requirements and require post-deposition RTA to relieve stresses. Figure 4 is a transmission electron micrograph showing the as-deposited phase morphology for the MICS polysilicon [Johnson and Krulevitch <ref> (1993) </ref>]. The graph on the right shows the stress gradient through the polysilicon thickness, and illustrates how the intrinsic stress is directly associated with this morphology. This stress can go from compressive to tensile depending on whether the film is amorphous or crystalline respectively. <p> the drying step of the microstructure release: simple air or infrared heat-lamp drying, vacuum sublimation drying such as was attempted with t-butyl alcohol or methanol-water mixtures [Inoue and Osatake (1988), Guckel et al. (1989)], temporary polymeric supporting members which are later plasma removed as was reported by Mastrangelo and Saloka <ref> (1993) </ref> when they used parylene as an intermediate support structure during the HF sacrificial etch, or supercritical drying of hydrophilic passivated structures as was pioneered for MEMS devices by Mulhern [Mulhern et al. (1993)]. <p> (1989)], temporary polymeric supporting members which are later plasma removed as was reported by Mastrangelo and Saloka <ref> (1993) </ref> when they used parylene as an intermediate support structure during the HF sacrificial etch, or supercritical drying of hydrophilic passivated structures as was pioneered for MEMS devices by Mulhern [Mulhern et al. (1993)]. Yields with the first method are very low unless some form of fusible link anchor structure is designed to hold the MEMS device in place during release and packaging [Fedder et al. (1992)]. <p> Vacuum encapsulation is desirable for high mechanical quality factor and thermal noise minimization. Integrated micro-vacuum shells may be feasible in the MICS process. This process was first demonstrated for bulk micromachined microlamp devices by Mastrangelo [Mastrangelo and Muller <ref> (1993) </ref>] where polysilicon filaments were encased by an optically transparent low-stress silicon nitride film. Holes were cut in the nitride film to allow the removal of the bulk silicon using an anisotropic potassium hydroxide etchant. <p> During the pumpdown step of the LPCVD operation the shells were evacuated to a pressure of 300 mT prior to deposition and encapsulation. Later attempts by Lin and McNair [Lin et al. <ref> (1993) </ref>] expanded this technique to surface micromachined devices covered with thick PSG platforms. Opening etch holes in the nitride, removing the sacrificial glass, and resealing the holes with nitride, produced a fully encapsulated MICS resonator, which operated at the reduced pressure. <p> The level of integration for this early device exceeded 500 transistors on-chip with the micromechanics. The overall die size was 12.5 mm 2 . CMOS electronics [Nguyen and Howe <ref> (1993) </ref>]. This oscillator takes advantage of the high Q of the polysilicon resonator, with frequency ranges from 100 Hertz to tens of megahertz, and measured Q's of 50000 for 100 kHz (unbalanced) while operated under vacuum.

Reference-contexts: Our process requires that the sacrificial layer etch rapidly in hydrofluoric acid. As a result, the SOG is applied directly onto a heavily phosphorus-doped interdielec-tric PSG layer rather than an undoped LTO layer. Adhesion problems of the siloxane-based SOG to the heavily doped dielectric glass [Gupta <ref> (1989) </ref>] were not observed. Slight adjustments could however be made to the doping level of the thin interdielectric layer if adhesion became an issue. The final steps in the structural fabrication sequence involve releasing the polysilicon structures by dissolving the sacrificial phosphosilicate glass in aqueous hydrofluoric acid. <p> At this time there are four methods commonly used to execute the drying step of the microstructure release: simple air or infrared heat-lamp drying, vacuum sublimation drying such as was attempted with t-butyl alcohol or methanol-water mixtures [Inoue and Osatake (1988), Guckel et al. <ref> (1989) </ref>], temporary polymeric supporting members which are later plasma removed as was reported by Mastrangelo and Saloka (1993) when they used parylene as an intermediate support structure during the HF sacrificial etch, or supercritical drying of hydrophilic passivated structures as was pioneered for MEMS devices by Mulhern [Mulhern et al.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately the large barrier height of titanium silicide to p-type silicon and the greater than 20% volumetric reduction during disilicide formation [Murarka <ref> (1983) </ref>] can cause problems both for the P+ S/D current-voltage linearity and metallization cracking within the contact regions. The latter problem can be somewhat curtailed by thinning down the as-deposited titanium to below 250 A , which also prevents undue silicon consumption during the three-step silicidation.
