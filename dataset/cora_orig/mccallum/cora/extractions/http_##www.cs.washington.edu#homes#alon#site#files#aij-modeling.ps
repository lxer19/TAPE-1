Abstract: Constructing an appropriate model is a crucial step in performing the reasoning required to successfully answer a query about the behavior of a physical situation. In the compositional modeling approach [5], a system is provided with a library of composable pieces of knowledge about the physical world called model fragments. The model construction problem involves selecting appropriate model fragments to describe the situation. Model construction can be considered either for static analysis of a single state or for simulation of dynamic behavior over a sequence of states. The latter is significantly more difficult than the former since one must select model fragments without knowing exactly what will happen in the future states. The model construction problem in general can advantageously be formulated as a problem of reasoning about relevance of knowledge that is available to the system using a general framework for reasoning about relevance described in [19, 14]. In this paper, we present a model formulation procedure based on that framework for selecting model fragments efficiently for the case of simulation. For such an algorithm to be useful, the generated model must be adequate for answering the given query and, at the same time, as simple as possible. We define formally the concepts of adequacy and simplicity and show that the algorithm in fact generates an adequate and simplest model.

Reference-contexts: Their approach also does not provide guarantees of sufficiency or simplicity. The idea of explicitly representing the differences between CMFs in an assumption class is similar to the graph of models by Addanki et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Their work addresses the problem of selecting among complete models. Since the models in their graph are complete models instead of fragments, the space requirement of their approach increases exponentially as the number of possible modeling assumptions increases.

Reference-contexts: The main difference is that we provide clear semantics for Rel based on the relevance reasoning framework, and that we distinguish relevance of different elements (i.e., terms or ground atoms). In general, it is hard to assign semantics for relevance predicates (see e.g., <ref> [13, 2, 7] </ref>). However, in this paper we have limited the relevance claims to apply only to ground terms and ground atomic sentences.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, a designer would be able to make better informed decisions during the design process, improving the efficiency of the process as well as the quality of the final design. 1.1.1 Compositional Modeling as a Modeling Paradigm Compositional modeling <ref> [5] </ref> is an effective method for automatically formulating a behavior model represented by a system of ordinary differential equations for a physical system that can be adequately modeled as a lumped-parameter system 1 . <p> Several pieces of work have addressed the model formulation problem for the compositional modeling approach <ref> [5, 21, 24] </ref>. Our work is distinguished in that it combines model formulation for simulation with guarantees of adequacy and simplicity, which is not found in other work. 1.3 Relevance Reasoning For Model Formulation Our model formulation procedure is based on a general framework for reasoning about relevance of knowledge. <p> The first tool (see Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2) provides the ability to state relevance claims that describe when a model fragment can be used and to express additional domain knowledge that comes to bear in selecting a model. Such claims are a generalization of the consider predicate described in <ref> [5] </ref>, but the relevance framework provided clear semantics for such statements. The second tool (see Section 3.1.4) enables the user to explicitly state the difference between the modeling assumptions made in different models of the same phenomenon. <p> Compositional modeling was first described by Forbus in his work on Qualitative Process Theory (QPT) [6] and is also the basis of subsequent work on qualitative modeling by Falkenhainer and For-bus <ref> [5] </ref>, Crawford, Farquhar and Kuipers [3], and Iwasaki and Low [9]. The purpose of this section is to explain in general terms the essence of the compositional modeling approach, which we take as the starting point in the work presented here on model formulation. <p> We can then describe the additional knowledge and the organization we impose on the knowledge base to facilitate model formulation. Though the terms used to describe parts of a model fragment and the actual simulation procedures differ somewhat in different systems <ref> [6, 3, 9, 5] </ref>, the underlying principles are the same in all of them. Here, we will use the nomenclature and the definitions given in CML (Compositional Modeling Language) [?]. <p> Let f 1 ; : : :; f n be the participants of a model fragment M . Let o (X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) be the conditions of M and 3 The term "operating conditions" is also consistent with its usage in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 To simplify discussion, we assume that the consequences do not contain inequalities on quantities. <p> It also discussed the difficulty of actually formulating an appropriate model especially for the purpose of simulation. In this section, we describe the additional representational tools we use in order to facilitate model formulation, such as composite model fragments, assumption classes (originally introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>), and explicit modeling constraints. The first two are used for imposing additional organization on the 13 model fragment library, and the third is used for expressing domain-dependent knowledge about relevance of model fragments. <p> For example, the literal :large (timeScale) states that the representation is simplified to ignore longer term effects on the battery. The predicate Rel is similar in spirit to the Consider predicate used in <ref> [5] </ref>. The main difference is that we provide clear semantics for Rel based on the relevance reasoning framework, and that we distinguish relevance of different elements (i.e., terms or ground atoms). In general, it is hard to assign semantics for relevance predicates (see e.g., [13, 2, 7]). <p> In that case, our model formulation procedure would work with model fragments rather than with CMFs and achieve the same effect. 10 We are giving the term "assumption-class" a slightly different meaning from that given to it by Falken-hainer and Forbus in <ref> [5] </ref>. In Falkenhainer and Forbus' work, an assumption class is a class of modeling assumptions which are assumptions about the same aspect of the represented phenomena but are mutually exclusive. For example, viscous fluid and inviscid fluid belong to the same assumption class, which is about the viscosity of fluid. <p> RelObjectRef inement (O; r) ^ r (O; X) ^ RelObject (O) ) RelObject (X). The following examples of constraints specify a variation on a heuristic used by Falken-hainer and Forbus <ref> [5] </ref>. Their heuristic is to include in a model all the components of the minimal covering system, defined to be the lowest common ancestor of the components mentioned in the query in the part-of hierarchy of the system being modeled. <p> It should be noted that the library coherence assumption is made implicitly in <ref> [5] </ref>. In fact, if we assume (as in Qualitative Process Theory [6]) that all equations are uniquely causally oriented, then the library coherence assumption follows when we make the causal approximations assumption and the assumption that the most complicated scenario model is adequate. <p> Finally, we note that Nayak's methods for model simplification can be applied to the simulation model generated at every state from our scenario model. Falkenhainer and Forbus' work on compositional modeling <ref> [5] </ref> describes the representation aspects of compositional modeling and addresses the model construction problem. In their framework, every model fragment has a set of relevance conditions corresponding to our modeling conditions. Our use of relevance claims enriches their language (specifically their Consider predicate) and provides it with a formal basis.

Reference-contexts: The direction of causality only emerges when the equation is embedded in a system of equations each of which represents an independent mechanism and the quantities that are externally determined are specified. The theory of causal ordering <ref> [10] </ref> provides an operational definition of causality in such a system of equations. By applying the causal ordering procedure to a self-contained system of equations, one can determine the causal dependency relations among the quantities in the equations.

Reference-contexts: Thus, model formulation can be considered as a special case of a more general problem of reasoning about relevance of knowledge for a given goal. Researchers such as Subramanian and Genesereth [27] and Levy <ref> [14] </ref> have proposed general frameworks for reasoning about relevance of knowledge. In this paper, we present an application of one of them, namely Levy's, to the problem of model formulation. <p> Often, it is possible to detect efficiently that facts (or sets of facts) in the knowledge base are irrelevant to a query <ref> [27, 19, 14] </ref>, or to detect that a knowledge base can abstracted while still being able to answer a set of queries correctly [28, 15]. <p> In other cases, it is possible to give the system additional meta-level control advice as to which facts in the knowledge base are possibly relevant to a query, therefore enabling the inference mechanism to ignore the rest. Levy has developed a general framework for reasoning about relevance <ref> [19, 14, 16] </ref>, and the model selection procedure presented in this paper is based on that framework. The framework provides a space of definitions of irrelevance with a comparison of their properties and provides a language in which additional meta-level knowledge about irrelevance can 6 be given to a system. <p> This entails deciding which abstractions and approximations can be made in modeling the system. Levy in <ref> [15, 14] </ref> demonstrates that knowledge underlying such decisions can be stated as relevance claims and better understood when stated in that 26 form.

The framework provides a space of definitions of irrelevance with a comparison of their properties and provides a language in which additional meta-level knowledge about irrelevance can 6 be given to a system. <p> An important aspect of relevance reasoning that is emphasized in this framework is the need to decide which facts in the knowledge base are relevant without actually considering the whole knowledge base. In particular, the algorithms described in <ref> [16] </ref> consider knowledge bases including a set of Horn rules and a set of ground facts, but the algorithms do not consider the ground facts when determining relevance of facts to a query. <p> In fact, the graph of causal influences is similar in spirit to the query-tree, the data structure used to represent which facts may be part of a derivation of a query over a Horn rule knowledge base <ref> [16] </ref>. 2. Second, the need to reason about how to model each phenomenon lead us to developing two representational tools for supporting such reasoning.

Other instances of this problem are also currently 43 under investigation, such as reasoning with contexts and query evaluation in distributed heterogeneous databases <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge is given implicitly by the set E input of quantities that are assumed to be exogenous and by the time invariant facts in the description of the system. The problem we face here is analogous to the relevance reasoning problem discussed by Levy and Sagiv in <ref> [18] </ref> in the context of Horn rule knowledge bases and database systems. There, the problem was to decide which ground formulas are irrelevant to a given query without actually knowing which ground formulas are in the knowledge base. <p> In doing so, unless it was explicitly stated that some ground formulas are not in the knowledge base, it was assumed that they might be. 16 Analogously, here we assume that the system can actually reach any state that is consistent with our partial knowledge. As in <ref> [18] </ref>, any additional knowledge about the reachable states may enable us to select a simpler scenario model.

Reference-contexts: All of these properties follow if we assume that whenever c i &lt; c j , then c i is an approximation of c j of the type that Nayak calls causal approximations <ref> [22] </ref>. A model fragment is a causal approximation of another model fragment if the set of causal relations entailed 19 by the former is a subset of those entailed by the latter. Nayak has argued that causal approximations cover most approximation relations encountered in practice. <p> We can extract the complete model efficiently using the methods described by Nayak in <ref> [22] </ref>. 5.1.2 Causal Approximations and Horn Restriction The only role of the causal approximations assumption and the restriction that the modeling constraints must be Horn is to guarantee efficient performance of the model formulation algorithm. <p> The Horn restriction guarantees that once a positive literal has been put in Rel that it will not be retracted. Relaxing either of these two assumptions will require the algorithm to perform arbitrary backtracking and constraint satisfaction. As shown in <ref> [22] </ref>, this will cause the model selection problem to be intractable. Finally, the assumption that all assumption classes are linear guarantees that a simplest scenario model can be found in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, model formulation can be considered as a special case of a more general problem of reasoning about relevance of knowledge for a given goal. Researchers such as Subramanian and Genesereth <ref> [27] </ref> and Levy [14] have proposed general frameworks for reasoning about relevance of knowledge. In this paper, we present an application of one of them, namely Levy's, to the problem of model formulation. <p> Often, it is possible to detect efficiently that facts (or sets of facts) in the knowledge base are irrelevant to a query <ref> [27, 19, 14] </ref>, or to detect that a knowledge base can abstracted while still being able to answer a set of queries correctly [28, 15].

Reference-contexts: Often, it is possible to detect efficiently that facts (or sets of facts) in the knowledge base are irrelevant to a query [27, 19, 14], or to detect that a knowledge base can abstracted while still being able to answer a set of queries correctly <ref> [28, 15] </ref>. In other cases, it is possible to give the system additional meta-level control advice as to which facts in the knowledge base are possibly relevant to a query, therefore enabling the inference mechanism to ignore the rest.

Reference-contexts: Our approach can be viewed as combining the idea of a graph of models with compositional modeling. The model simplification problem has been addressed by Williams [30] and Weld <ref> [29] </ref>. Williams also makes use of causal influence graphs to simplify a model. Both Weld and Williams assume a complete model of the situation as an input.

Reference-contexts: The intuition underlying this algorithm is similar to the intuition underlying the construction of the query-tree described in [19], which represents all the possible derivations of the query, and to other work on model formulation that follows causal chains in order to build models (e.g., <ref> [23, 30, 25] </ref>). 4.2.2 Selecting the Level of Detail The second part of the model selection problem is determining the level of detail at which to model each phenomenon. This entails deciding which abstractions and approximations can be made in modeling the system. <p> Our approach can be viewed as combining the idea of a graph of models with compositional modeling. The model simplification problem has been addressed by Williams <ref> [30] </ref> and Weld [29]. Williams also makes use of causal influence graphs to simplify a model.

Reference-contexts: Williams also makes use of causal influence graphs to simplify a model. Both Weld and Williams assume a complete model of the situation as an input. Williams also makes use of the idea of following causal influences in his work on innovative design <ref> [31] </ref>. 7 Discussion This document described a method for selecting model fragments to generate a scenario model that is appropriate for answering a given query.
