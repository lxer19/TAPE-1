Abstract: Information gathering systems are operating in an ever growing environment of information sources. One of the main challenges of information gathering research is to generate a high-quality response to the information needs of the user. To achieve this goal, systems will have to trade off computational resources for quality of results. This paper shows how a special type of anytime algorithms can be used efficiently to construct and monitor information gathering systems.

Reference-contexts: However, recent work has shown that by structuring the available knowledge in a hierarchical way and by limiting the amount of data and knowledge used at each level, we can construct knowledge-based systems that have all the characteristics of "well-behaved" anytime algorithms <ref> [ Mouaddib and Zilberstein, 1995 ] </ref> . Another difficulty with information gathering systems is the limited applicability of static CPPs since information may be constantly added or deleted, the validity of data may expire, and computation load may limit the availability of information.

Reference-contexts: The next two sections describe briefly the meta-level information structures and the monitoring approach that we propose. 3 Representing expectations with CPPs The performance of elementary anytime algorithms can be characterized statistically using performance profiles <ref> [ Boddy and Dean, 1989 ] </ref> . A performance profile describes how the quality of the output improves as a function of execution time. We have developed an off-line compilation process that constructs the performance profile of a composite system based on the performance profiles of its components.

Reference-contexts: In previous work, we have developed an effective model for building complex systems using anytime algorithms as components <ref> [ Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . In particular, we have developed off-line compilation techniques and run-time monitoring strategies to maximize the utility of such systems. In this paper we examine the applicability of these results to the problem of information gathering and propose a particular solution. <p> Moreover, we found that in many domains it is undesirable to produce an interruptible algorithm, given the performance degradation that is involved in the transformation from a contract algorithm. Instead, we developed several monitoring strategies for contract algorithms <ref> [ Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . Information gathering is, in particular, a domain where contract algorithms can be used efficiently. Prior knowledge about the characteristics of different information sources and the time-dependent utility of the user can be used to optimally control the information gathering process.

Reference-contexts: These dependencies can be described by the CPP of the planning algorithm. Through our compilation mechanism we can generate similar expectations for complex tasks that involve many interdependent operators. We have constructed CPPs for sensing and planning algorithms and used them successfully in a path-planning application <ref> [ Zilberstein and Russell, 1993 ] </ref> . Unfortunately, in standard knowledge-based systems it is hard to characterize the performance improvement as a function of time.
