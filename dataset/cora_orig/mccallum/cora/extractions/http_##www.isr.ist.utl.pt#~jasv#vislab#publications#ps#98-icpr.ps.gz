Abstract: We present an egomotion estimation method for a monocular observer moving with arbitrary motion. The method is uniquely based on the normal flow field and the estimation problem is defined in a particular topological space | the L-space | to allow the use of global data for the final estimates. Additionally, robust statistics methods are used for motion model selection, and provide improved robustness to image noise and data outliers. Extensive experimental tests are presented and discussed. Keywords: Normal flow, egomotion, robust regression methods

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the direct methods rely exclusively on the normal flow field, or first order spatio temporal image derivatives [6, 2, 3], thus overcoming the ill-posedness nature of the flow estimation image matching problems <ref> [1] </ref>. We extend previous work [9, 10], by formulating the problem on a different space | the L-space | that allows for numerous normal flow vectors to contribute for the problem solution, hence improving robustness and reliability. The input data consists exclusively of first-order spatio-temporal image derivatives.

Reference-contexts: We address the problem of egomotion estimation for a a monocular observer with arbitrary translation and rotation.

Reference-contexts: The function (x) is the inverse of the time-to-crash, given by (x; y) = W=Z (x; y). Assuming that the scene is composed of textured objects under slowly varying illumination, the familiar brightness-constancy hypothesis <ref> [5] </ref> holds. This implies that we can only estimate the component of the optical flow, v, along the image gradient direction, vector n.

Reference-contexts: The problem is to estimate both a ij and b ij . Various estimators have been proposed to detect and remove outliers (see <ref> [8] </ref> for an extended introduction to robust estimation). We adopted the Least Median of Squares (LMS) estimator: min med k R 2 where the residual R = v ij (a ij r + b ij ) and k indexes the observations in line fd i ; j g. <p> In this bidimensional regression problem, the LMS estimation can be solved by a non-iterative algorithm, as presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. When determining an LMS estimate of ^a ij and ^ b ij , the residuals, R k , are compared to an estimate, * ij , of the error scale.
