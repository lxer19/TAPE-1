Abstract: One of the key problems in appearance-based vision is understanding how to use a set of labeled images to classify new images. Classification systems that can model human performance, or that use robust image matching methods, often make use of similarity judgments that are non-metric; but when the triangle inequality is not obeyed, most existing pattern recognition techniques are not applicable. We note that exemplar-based (or nearest-neighbor) methods can be applied naturally when using a wide class of nonmetric similarity functions. The key issue, however, is to find methods for choosing good representatives of a class that accurately characterize it. We show that existing condensing techniques for finding class representatives are ill-suited to deal with non-metric dataspaces. We then focus on developing techniques for solving this problem, emphasizing two points: First, we show that the distance between two images is not a good measure of how well one image can represent another in non-metric spaces. Instead, we use the vector correlation between the distances from each image to other previously seen images. Second, we show that in non-metric spaces, boundary points are less significant for capturing the structure of a class than they are in Euclidean spaces. We suggest that atypical points may be more important in describing classes. We demonstrate the importance of these ideas to learning that generalizes from experience by improving performance using both synthetic and real images.

Reference-contexts: The region of points closer to the point on the left is shown in black, and closer to the right-most point is shown in white. Fig. 4a,b), we may wish to identify new silhouettes (Fig. 4d) based on their similarity to the previously seen ones. <ref> [1] </ref> reviews many such algorithms, and discusses why their use will typically lead to non-metric distances. In this paper we make two contributions to this problem. First, we show that existing methods can indeed encounter considerable difficulties when applied to non-metric similarity functions.

Reference-contexts: Related robust techniques, such as M-estimation which identify outliers and weigh them less heavily, also lead to non-metric distances [5]. Also, the use of non-metric L p distances, with 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 has been suggested for robust image matching <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Non-metric distances turn up in many application domains, such as string (DNA) matching, collaborative filtering (where customers are matched with stored "prototypical" customers), and retrieval from image data bases. Fig. 4 shows one example, the output of an algorithm for judging the similarity of the silhouettes of different objects <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> By using uniformly distributed test data, we estimate the volume of the difference in the voronoi diagrams produced by the complete set and the representative subset. 4.3 Test with Real data To test our method with real images, we used the local curve matching algorithm described in <ref> [4] </ref>. This curve matching algorithm is designed to compare curves which may be quite different, and return the distance between them.

Reference-contexts: One group of such functions is the family of image comparison methods that match subsets of the images and ignore the most dissimilar parts. We call these non-metric methods median distances (for discussion, see <ref> [6, 8] </ref>). A median distance between two vectors (or images, represented as vectors) x; y 2 R n is defined as: medianfjx 1 y 1 j; : : : ; jx n y n jg. A k-median is the k-th value of the ordered difference vec tor.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the mean point of a set is used in methods such as k-means clustering, and minimal linear spanning bases are used in methods such as Radial Basis Functions or PCA methods. <ref> [9] </ref> provides a review of such methods. However, in this paper we assume only that we can compute distances between images. We do not have a mapping from images to vectors in a Euclidean space. <p> Typically, they attempt to find subsets of the training classes that are as small as possible, and that will correctly classify all the remainder of the training set, which is then discarded (see <ref> [9] </ref> for a review). Condensing algorithms do not explicitly rely on distances that obey the triangle inequality, and related algorithms have been proposed for nearest neighbor classification in [7].

Reference-contexts: Finally, we are interested in image comparison methods that model human vision, where it has been demonstrated that human similarity judgments are non-metric <ref> [10] </ref>. 2.2 Why existing methods are not suit able to deal with non-metric distances In this paper we specifically focus on the problem of supervised learning in non-metric spaces.

Reference-contexts: We compare two methods of predicting this correlation: (1) the distance between the two images; and (2) redundancy: the degree of similarity between their distance vectors. We can show (proof is in <ref> [11] </ref>) that when a Euclidean distance is used, there is no need to look at redundancy. Distance alone is an excellent indication of how well one image may substitute for another.
