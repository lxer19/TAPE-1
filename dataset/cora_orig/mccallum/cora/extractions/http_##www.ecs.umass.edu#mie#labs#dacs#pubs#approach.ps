Abstract: In this paper we consider the fixed-filter design approach for active noise control (ANC) in ducts. Based on a large body of literature during the past decade that deals strictly with adaptive filter solutions (see [1] and references contained therein) the fixed-filter approach appears to be all but discarded for this application. The ANC system under consideration has a similar configuration to those used in most adaptive implementations; i.e., a duct equipped with both feedforward and feedback sensors and a control speaker. Our design of a linear, time-invariant controller involves three steps: (1) system identification from the experimental duct frequency response, (2) H 1 synthesis using the identified plant and model errors, and (3) use of Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) to further improve performance by sequential tuning of the feedback and feedforward filters using the experimental data. Preliminary experiments indicate that attenuation levels of 10-30 dB are achievable over a 400 Hz band without amplification in the immediate range. An important consequence of LTI designs is that performance is guaranteed for wideband noise as well as pure tone disturbances in adaptive schemes stability and performance may be very difficult (if impossible) to guarantee beforehand. This paper focuses on the third step of our three-step approach the QFT design aspect - (the other two steps are described in [2]).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Historically, ANC in ducts has been the focus of much attention since successful duct silencing has a commercial potential <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, active noise reduction in automobile exhaust systems reduces back pressure on the engine thereby increasing engine efficiency as well as attenuating low-frequency engine noise that traditional mu*ers fail to quiet. There exists a potential for reducing acoustic pollution by attenuating fan and blower noise in HVAC systems. <p> Despite the positive outlook in a recent ANC review paper [1], adaptive schemes suffer drawbacks including instability [5] especially in the presence of acoustic feedback which is prevalent in duct systems; see <ref> [3] </ref>. A natural approach to these adaptive schemes is fixed-filter designs which enjoy tractable performance and stability analysis.

QFT tuning In this section we see an interplay between the H 1 and QFT design techniques. While H 1 is model-based and hence must use (possibly conservative) error models, QFT tuning works directly with the experimental frequency response data.

Reference-contexts: The performance problem in Eqs. (2) and (3) is in standard linear fractional transformation form for computing QFT bounds <ref> [10] </ref>. The associated loop is L m (j!) = C m (j!) 1 + C e (j!)P eu (j!) Once C m (s) is re-designed, QFT-based tuning is accomplished on the feedback controller C e (s). <p> The notation used for plotting QFT bounds is: a solid line indicates that the loop response must lie above the line, while a dashed line indicates that the loop response must lie below the line. The QFT design was executed using the QFT Toolbox <ref> [10] </ref>. Remarks 1. During the design process it was observed that good performance was correlated to having either C m (s)P mu (s) or C m (s)P mu (s) having ccw encirclements of the critical point. The reason for this is not yet clearly understood.
