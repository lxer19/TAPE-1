Abstract: In this paper, we propose solutions to several multicast core management problems, including automatic core selection, core failure handling, and core migration, for use in networks based on link-state routing. The proposed approach uses a central server, called the core binding server (CBS), to manage core-group bindings, accompanied by a network-level leader election protocol in order to achieve robustness. By modeling the selection of the CBS as a leader election problem, this approach can handle any combination of network component failures, including those that partition the network. Further, our simulation results reveal that the central server can sustain extremely high workloads, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our core selection and core migration methods. fl Yih Huang will present this paper, if it is accepted. y Philip McKinley is the corresponding author.

Reference-contexts: A multicast protocol typically constructs a "tree" of communication links; routers within the tree handle replication and forwarding of messages to group members. The type of multicast tree varies among multicast protocols. A common technique, found in the CBT <ref> [1] </ref> and PIM [2] protocols, is core based forwarding (CBF). A CBF multicast protocol associates a core node with each multicast group; the multicast tree of the group is defined to be the union of core-to-members shortest paths.

Hence, automatic core selection by the network is preferred over host-level approaches, such as <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. Core failure handling. A potential weakness of CBF multicast is the single point of failure at the core. Methods are required to assign new cores to multicast groups whose current cores have failed. 3. Core migration.

Reference-contexts: Several network-level methods have been developed to address these issues. For example, a bootstrap mechanism is proposed by the PIM community <ref> [4] </ref>. In this method, when a multicast group is created or the core node of an existing group has failed, a hash function is used to map the address/ID of the group to a router in the network as its core node.

Reference-contexts: However, core migration is not supported. To remedy this problem, an independent core migration protocol can be used; at least one such protocol has been proposed by Donahoo et al. <ref> [5] </ref>.

(The PIM protocol satisfies this requirement. However, minor changes are required for other CBF protocols to meet this requirement. Our previous study showed that, within a routing domain, the workload produced by member-list maintenance at the core is not a performance bottleneck <ref> [8] </ref>.)

In addition to the operational overhead of the LCM protocol, we also investigated the characteristics of multicast trees that result from the LCM core selection and core migration methods. Specifically, we studied the core-to-member distances of such multicast tress.

Reference-contexts: Since at this moment no further membership information regarding m is available, solutions to this initial core selection problem are limited. Previously proposed methods include random selection (randomly pick a router in the network) and random member (randomly pick a router member) <ref> [10] </ref>. The LCM protocol adopts a variation of the random member heuristic, called the first-member heuristic, which operates as follows: when the CBS receives a CORE-MAPPING (m) request from router x for a group m whose Core (m) does not exist in C, it sets Core (m) to x.

Reference-contexts: In the busiest cases, 200 groups of 200 members each are created within 1 minute, producing 40000 CORE-MAPPING requests within that interval. We assumed the service time of such a request to be 700 sec, which is a typical IP/UDP software overhead observed on many platforms <ref> [11] </ref>. We used this figure because the look-up of the core binding list can be implemented in O (log S) time. The overhead of this task should be negligible when compared to the software overhead of receiving and returning messages. Results of this study are presented in Figure 3.
