Abstract: Though there have been several recent efforts to develop disk based video servers, these approaches have all ignored the topic of updates and disk server crashes. In this paper, we present a priority based model for building video servers that handle two classes of events: user events that could include enter, play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, exit, as well as system events such as insert, delete, server-down, server-up that correspond to uploading new movie blocks onto the disk(s), eliminating existing blocks from the disk(s), and/or experiencing a disk server crash. We will present algorithms to handle such events. Our algorithms are provably correct, and computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we guarantee that under certain reasonable conditions, continuing clients experience jitter free presentations. We further justify the efficiency of our techniques with a prototype implementation and experimental results.

Reference-contexts: the resilience of our video server against disk server crashes, i.e. how well does our video server perform when crashes occur? To compare, we used three different types of disk server configurations homogeneous disks of evenly high performance characteristics, homogeneous disks of evenly low performance characteristics, and heterogeneous disk servers <ref> [3] </ref>. We generated client requests and disk crashes randomly (but in accordance with certain parameters described below) for each case. To compare the resilience of our video server against server crashes, we first measured the average number of continuing clients.
