Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 454 January, 1998 Abstract A probabilistic framework for representing and visually recognizing complex multi-agent action is presented. Motivated by work in model-based object recognition and designed for the recognition of action from visual evidence, the representation has three components: (1) temporal structure descriptions representing the logical and temporal relationships between agent goals, (2) belief networks for probabilistically representing and recognizing individual agent goals from visual evidence, and (3) belief networks automatically generated from the temporal structure descriptions that support the recognition of the complex action. We describe our current work on recognizing American football plays from noisy trajectory data. Keywords: vision, knowledge repre sentation, plan recognition

Belief networks have been used for visual recognition of static objects <ref> [20, 1] </ref> and for visual attention selection [29]. Promising work on recognizing single-agent action from trajectory information using transition diagrams and fuzzy reasoning [19, 23] led us to investigate the use of belief networks, which more explicitly represent knowledge dependencies and are computationally well-understood, for multi-agent action recognition.

Reference-contexts: Note that the description includes definitions of compound goals, such as iwb5, catchPassAndRunWB. 2.2.1 Temporal relations By assumption, the goals of an agent are active during temporal intervals of finite duration; they are not instantaneous events. As such, Allen's interval algebra <ref> [2] </ref> applies and there are potentially 7 possible temporal relations (not counting inverses). However, that algebra requires precise definition of the endpoints of the intervals.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As computer vision begins to address increasingly dynamic domains, for instance video annotation and automatic surveillance, the general task of recognition grows to encompass not only understanding simple motion but also identifying large scale actions <ref> [22, 4] </ref>. As it does, the methods of recognition can no longer be supported solely by measurement and geometry or by precise CAD-like models, as is typical of static object recognition.

Reference-contexts: Previous work in traffic understanding has used an agent-based belief network and agent-centered features for recognition of driving activity from simulated data [8] and real data <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. Unlike this work and other systems that reason about action using physics-based properties [21], here the system must also represent and recognize high-level domain knowledge requiring that logical and temporal relationships between multiple agents be modeled.

Reference-contexts: However, unlike [11] and other work where logics of intention and communication are proposed to determine if an agent's behavior is logically consistent with a given goal, we will define goals by their (probabilistic) characteristic behaviors, building on work in probabilistic plan recognition <ref> [6] </ref>. To evaluate whether an agent has a particular goal at a particular time we will evaluate the perceptual evidence. For example, the halfback can have the goal of running between the tackle and the guard. <p> Furthermore, in the absence of logical relations, component goals of compound goals are considered conditionally independent providing independent evidence in support of their predecessor compound goal. 3 Visual networks Previous work has shown that agent goals can be represented in a probabilistic framework using Bayesian belief networks <ref> [6, 15, 25] </ref>. We also use belief networks based on visual evidence, or visual networks, that offer a rich representation designed to handle uncertainty in evidence, goal models, spatial reasoning, and temporal reasoning. <p> Using Bayesian networks to probabilistically model plans relaxed the strict assumptions of the plan hierarchies model. Networks can represent multiple top-level goals where probabilistic priors can be used to rank two equally possible but not equally likely plans <ref> [6] </ref>. Further, they have been used to integrate "action patterns" and beliefs about agent's mental state [25].

Reference-contexts: The task there is to match a given object model to an image from which edge elements have been extracted. One of the more successful approaches to this problem is that of using feature-model interpretation matching trees, where the visual features are edge segments <ref> [9] </ref>. Each layer of the tree represents a given model edge.

Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, </journal> <volume> 9(4) </volume> <pages> 469-482, </pages> <year> 1987. </year>
Reference-contexts: The goal, of course, is to find the correct hypotheses. However the number of edges make exhaustive search com-putationally prohibitive. Rather, the approach is to find a consistent hypothesis, and assume that consistency implies correctness. As developed in <ref> [10] </ref> the order of the consistency can be varied depending upon computational resources and accuracy requirements. For example, if we restrict our attention to two-dimensional objects, a unary consistency check simply requires that each model edge is at least as long as the proposed matching image edge. <p> A binary consistency check verifies not only the unary relations but also all pairwise relationships, namely the angle and bounded distance between edges. Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [10] </ref> note that although it is mathematically possible for an incorrect interpretation to satisfy the binary relations, but not higher order relations, the probability of an object doing so falls precipitously as object complexity increases.

Reference-contexts: What are the equivalent of "model edges" in object recognition? Within our current framework, we use individual agent goals as the basis for the descriptive structure. We view complex actions as a partially ordered set of goal directed behaviors on the part of interacting agents. However, unlike <ref> [11] </ref> and other work where logics of intention and communication are proposed to determine if an agent's behavior is logically consistent with a given goal, we will define goals by their (probabilistic) characteristic behaviors, building on work in probabilistic plan recognition [6]. <p> then the evidence that observed is 4 times more likely than notObserved will be entered into the catchPass network). 4 Multi-agent networks Previous work on representing collaborative activity can be divided into methods that "compile" down team goals or intentions and those that have an explicit representation for group intentionality <ref> [11, 7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This work, like that of Hanks, Madigan, and Gavrin, assumes that temporal in formation is most naturally extracted from the expert, not obtained from the data. Therefore DBN representations that use time series propagation of temporal properties are not necessary the most appropriate model <ref> [12] </ref>. Huber has shown that simple goal recognition belief networks can be constructed automatically from representations of action used by a plan generation system and then used by a planning agent in a multi-object scene [14]. This project builds on Huber's work of automatic construction of networks.

Reference-contexts: Beliefs and evidence that check for this conditional, just like those in visual networks, are hung below the play goal node as needed. Conditional and prior probabilities for the network are determined automatically using heuristics matching table templates to specific node-link combinations, similar to the method used by Huber <ref> [14] </ref>. Our current research focuses on tuning and evaluating and the resulting multi-agent networks. The network shown in Figure 3 is for two players, where some actions have been removed for clarity. <p> Huber has shown that simple goal recognition belief networks can be constructed automatically from representations of action used by a plan generation system and then used by a planning agent in a multi-object scene <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The task and domain developed here is recognizing American football plays. It has the necessary attributes of containing complex actions (plays) performed by a multi-agent system (the offense) in which there is great uncertainty and unpredictability (the defense). Methods exist for tracking football players from video <ref> [16] </ref>. For the recognition task, we presume tracked data that provides the location and rough orientation of each player at each time during the play.

Currently the priors are also manually assigned, however some priors can be obtained from analyzing the evidence and the performance of particular feature detectors. playInProgress.
