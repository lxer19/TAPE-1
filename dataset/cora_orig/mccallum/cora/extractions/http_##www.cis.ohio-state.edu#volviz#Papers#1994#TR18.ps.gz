Abstract: Data in volume form consumes an extraordinary amount of storage space. For efficient storage and transmission of such data, compression algorithms are imperative. However, most volumetric datasets are used in biomedicine and other scientific applications where lossy compression is unacceptable. We present a lossless data-compression algorithm which, being oriented specifically for volume data, achieves greater compression performance than generic compression algorithms that are typically available on modern computer systems. Our algorithm is a combination of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) and Huffman coding and results in compression of around 50% for a set of volume data files.

Reference-contexts: Somewhat similar approaches, wherein the predictor is changed as local statistics change, have been developed for 2D image compression; these approaches fall under the general heading of adaptive DPCM and are discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. Localization of the predictor is one avenue we are currently pursuing to improve the compression performance of our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: One could obtain better predictions (and, thus, better compression) by designing a number of different predictors, each optimized to a particular section of the volume, rather than choosing one predictor for the entire volume. We propose dividing the volume into an octtree, as is done in <ref> [14] </ref>. A separate predictor would be designed for each leaf node. A suitable criterion would determine the sizes of the leaf nodes based on the following tradeoff. With small leaf nodes, the predictors will be better able to ex ploit local stationarity.
