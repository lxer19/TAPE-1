Abstract: on a Ptolemy users workstation, and we believe we should support these gains where possible. A drawback of the VIS is the dif ficulty of coding. Although the function-call syntax means the programmer does not have to manipulate registers directly, the need to manipulate multiple data w ords in parallel tak es some effort on the programmers part. We venture to suggest that VIS coding is as hard as, if not harder than, typical DSP coding. We were, ho wever, impressed with the real-time performance we could achie ve with the UltraSparc processorwith or without the VIS. Although the ten-band equalizer exhibits audio dropouts as soon as any other work is performed on the w orkstation, less intensive real-time programs have no such problems. We are currently extending the library of audio stars and user interf ace c o m p o n e n ts t o in c lu d e a r a n g e o f c o m m on a ud i o processing functions, such as ambience simulation and dynamic range control.
