Abstract: Like middle-men in physical commerce, middle-agents support the flow of information in electronic commerce, assisting in locating and connecting the ultimate information provider with the ultimate information requester. Many different types of middle-agents will be useful in realistic, large, distributed, open multi-agent problem solving systems. These include matchmakers or yellow page agents that process advertisements, blackboard agents that collect requests, and brokers that process both. The behaviors of each type of middle-agent have certain performance characteristicsprivacy, robustness, and adaptiveness qualitiesthat are related to characteristics of the external environment and of the agents themselves. For example, while brokered systems are more vulnerable to certain failures, they are also able to cope more quickly with a rapidly fluctuating agent workforce and meet certain privacy considerations. This paper identifies a spectrum of middle-agents, characterizes the behavior of three different types, and reports on initial experiments that focus on evaluating performance tradeoffs between matchmaking and brokering middle-agents, according to criteria such as load balancing, robustness, dynamic preferences or capabilities, and privacy.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the basic problems facing designers of open, multi-agent systems for the Internet is the connection problem <ref> [ Davis and Smith, 1983 ] </ref> finding the other agents who might have the information or other capabilities that you need. There are two special types of information used in this processpreferences and capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Second, we will examine characteristics of these behaviors with respect to robust and adaptive open systems, where agents might enter and exit the system at any time.

Reference-contexts: For example, some work describe agents that attempt to learn the preferences of people [ Maes and Kozierok, 1993 ] . Other work reports on agents that learn capabilities <ref> [ Kautz et al., 1996 ] </ref> . Hybrid organizations can be used to protect both requesters and providers from learning agents; e.g., requesters can use an anonymizer middle-agent even if the nominal organization is blackboard-like.

Reference-contexts: Clearly whenever a requester and provider come into direct contact multiple times it is possible for one to learn the preferences or capabilities of the other. For example, some work describe agents that attempt to learn the preferences of people <ref> [ Maes and Kozierok, 1993 ] </ref> . Other work reports on agents that learn capabilities [ Kautz et al., 1996 ] . Hybrid organizations can be used to protect both requesters and providers from learning agents; e.g., requesters can use an anonymizer middle-agent even if the nominal organization is blackboard-like.

Reference-contexts: Of course some decentralized load balancing can be done even in a matchmade organization, at the expense of extra communication. 2.3 Robustness Decentralized organizations such as matchmade or blackboard orgs with caching are significantly more robust than centralized organizations such as brokered orgs. Malone <ref> [ Malone, 1987 ] </ref> examines the basic vulnerability of decentralized and centralized markets, defined as the sum of the expected costs of each possible failure times the probability of that failure.

Reference-contexts: In the other, which we call in general brokered systems, only the broker comes to know both preferences and capabilities of a class of requesters and providers. Market-based programming systems <ref> [ Wellman, 1993 ] </ref> are a popular subclass of brokered system. Privacy, however, is only one concern when choosing a solution to the connection problem.
