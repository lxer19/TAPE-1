Abstract: We describe a connectionist encoding of schemas and reactive plans that can model high-level sensory-motor processes and can be a candidate representation for implementing reactive behaviors. The connectionist realization involves a number of ideas including the use of focal clusters and feedback loops to control a distributed process without a central controller, the expression and propagation of dynamic bindings via temporal synchrony, and a uniform mechanism for interaction between schemas, low level somatosensory and proprioceptive processes, as well as high-level reasoning and memory processes. Interestingly, our representation also provides solutions to some problems in language understanding, and relates to work in connectionist models of rapid (reflexive) reasoning.

Reference-contexts: interest in X-schemas has been increased by the discovery that these active representations can help solve certain problems in high level language and planning (Narayanan, 1997). 1.1 Computational Requirements As an example of a simplified X-schema, consider the high-level reactive plan for implementing a walking behavior shown in Figure 1 <ref> (Arbib, 1994) </ref>. When activated, this X-schema controls execution of the walk behavior until the desired destination is reached. This behavior is decomposable as a temporal arrangement of several sub-actions some of which may be primitive (corresponding to motor synergies) while others may be further decomposable (shaded nodes).

Reference-contexts: Our work on language learning requires that the representation of meaning be usable and that the system demonstrate its knowledge of verbs by carrying out verbal commands using a body simulation package <ref> (Bailey et al., 1997) </ref>. In other words, we require that the representations underlying the understanding of an action verb should be the same as the ones required to carry out the associated action. This has naturally led us to study X-schemas, their use in concept learning, and their neural representation.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the X-schema does not require explicit control variables the external world and the agent's perceptual mechanisms for locating objects in space provide the X-schema with the requisite information (cf. <ref> (Ballard et al., 1998) </ref>). Now imagine that the execution of this X-schema was interrupted and resumed subsequently. At this time the only critical requirement is that the invoking X-schema bind the object role of CLEAR to the same object that was initially intended to be cleared.

Reference-contexts: This has resulted in various proposals for the representation and use of compiled plans and behaviors (e.g., <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>). 1 In summary, the necessity to act quickly in an uncertain and dynamic world requires reactive planning agents to develop representations that can tightly couple action, execution monitoring, error-correction and failure recovery.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe a connectionist realization of X-schemas that draws upon our earlier work on routines <ref> (Feldman & Shastri, 1984) </ref> and more recent work on SHRUTI, a connectionist model of reflexive reasoning (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993).

Reference-contexts: We have referred to such active controllers as X-schemas since one of their distinguishing characteristic is their active nature (the X refers to executing) <ref> (Feldman, et al. 1996) </ref>. Interestingly, active representations also provide natural solutions to certain problems in language acquisition and understanding and we have been lead to such representations in our studies of cross-linguistic word and concept learning.

Reference-contexts: It also predicts the capacity of the dynamic memory underlying reflexive reasoning. The relevance of SHRUTI extends beyond reasoning to other forms of systematic and reflexive processing of relational information. For example, <ref> (Henderson, 1994) </ref> has shown that constraints predicted by SHRUTI explain several properties of human syntactic processing including garden path effects and our limited ability to deal with center-embedding. 2.2 Representational Machinery of SHRUTI General representation: Figure 3a illustrates the representation of predicates and entities.

Reference-contexts: While motor synergies control simple reflexes, the control of more complex actions requires the co-ordination of multiple synergies including timed parallel modulation. Evidence of a precompiled sequential motor plan for typing comes from (Sternberg et al., 1978), and <ref> (Jeannerod, 1986) </ref> demonstrates that grasping needs concurrent activation of multiple synergies (e.g., arm movement and preshaping), serial execution, and error-correction based on perceptual input from vision and touch.

Reference-contexts: Other examples of parameterizations include force (e.g. shove versus push), or direction (e.g. push versus pull). In most of our work on language we have been representing X-schemas as Petri nets <ref> (Murata, 1989) </ref>. The basic Petri net is a weighted, bipartite graph that consists of places (drawn as circles) and transitions (drawn as rectangles) connected by directed input and output arcs. Places hold tokens and represent predicates about the world or internal state.

Reference-contexts: The temporal details of motor actions and transitions from one phase of movement to another are often triggered and mediated by afferent feedback. (e.g., see <ref> (Pearson, 1993) </ref>). Such feedback is essential for producing effective motor output and synchronizing and coordinating it with ongoing positions, forces and movements in peripheral structures (Pearson, 1993). <p> The temporal details of motor actions and transitions from one phase of movement to another are often triggered and mediated by afferent feedback.

Such feedback is essential for producing effective motor output and synchronizing and coordinating it with ongoing positions, forces and movements in peripheral structures (Pearson, 1993). At the same time, researchers in AI and Robotics have realized that the need to generate real time behavior in complex and dynamic environments renders deliberative reasoning about the effects of low-level action too expensive and impractical.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the updating of episodic or working memory is treated as being similar to an external motor action. In recent work we have shown how a neural network can transform a transient pattern of activity into a persistent memory via long-term potentiation and depression <ref> (Shastri, 1997) </ref>. 3.3 Iteration and Interrupts its top. This example illustrates how X-schemas can encode iteration and use perceptual processes and the state of the external world to obviate the need for storing explicit state information.
