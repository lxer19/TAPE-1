Title: On the Geometric Separability of Boolean Functions  
Author: Tibor Heged-us and Nimrod Megiddo 
Note: (To appear in Discrete Applied Mathematics)  
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of the MEMBERSHIP problem for some geometrically defined classes of Boolean functions, i.e., the complexity of deciding whether a Boolean function given in DNF belongs to the class. We give a general argument implying that this problem is co-NP-hard for any class having some rather benign closure properties. Applying this result we show that the MEMBERSHIP problem is co-NP-complete for the class of linearly separable functions, threshold functions of order k (for any fixed k 0), and some binary-parameter analogues of these classes. Finally, we obtain that the considered problem for unions of k 3 halfs-paces is NP-hard, co-NP-hard and belongs to p 2 , and that the optimal threshold decomposition of a Boolean function as a union of halfspaces cannot even be efficiently approximated in a very strong sense unless P = NP. In some cases we improve previous hardness results on the considered problems.

Reference-contexts: We say that a Boolean function is a graphic halfspace if it is a graphic function and a halfspace. It is known that LINEAR SEPARABILITY with instances in monotone 2-DNF is solvable in deterministic polynomial time <ref> [6] </ref>, and the same holds true for the UNION OF 2 HALFSPACES problem as well [15]. However, for k 3 the problem becomes harder. Theorem 4.11. [25, 23] For any fixed k 3, UNION OF k HALFSPACES with instances in monotone 2-DNF is NP-complete. <p> The NP-hardness result for part (ii) follows from Theorem 4.11. Using the fact that for any l 1, the threshold number of the function y 1 y 2 _ y 3 y 4 _ . . . y 2l1 y 2l 2 F 2l is exactly l <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, all hardness results can be shown to remain valid even when the problems are restricted to instances in 3-DNF. <p> Question: Is the threshold number of f at most K? which is not easier than its previous fixed-parameter analogues. Theorem 4.14. THRESHOLD NUMBER is NP-hard, co-NP-hard, and belongs to p 2 . Proof: Follows from our previous arguments (in fact, the NP-hardness result was given already in <ref> [6] </ref>). Corollary 4.15. THRESHOLD NUMBER is not in NP [ co-NP unless NP = co-NP: Corollary 4.16. [6] OPTIMAL THRESHOLD DECOMPOSITION is NP-hard. <p> Theorem 4.14. THRESHOLD NUMBER is NP-hard, co-NP-hard, and belongs to p 2 . Proof: Follows from our previous arguments (in fact, the NP-hardness result was given already in <ref> [6] </ref>). Corollary 4.15. THRESHOLD NUMBER is not in NP [ co-NP unless NP = co-NP: Corollary 4.16. [6] OPTIMAL THRESHOLD DECOMPOSITION is NP-hard. Moreover, using the fixed-parameter hardness results from Theorem 4.12 and standard arguments from [7], one can show that the optimal threshold decomposition cannot be efficiently approximated (with respect to the number of elements) within any constant factor &lt; 3 2 unless P = NP.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the paper, the term NP-hard (co-NP-hard) means NP-hard (co-NP-hard) under p m reductions (polynomial time many-one reductions) (for details on p m reduc tions and other notions from complexity theory used in the paper, see <ref> [7, 3, 14] </ref>). 3. A general argument A class of Boolean functions is a sequence C = fC n g n1 , C n F n . In some cases we will also assume that every class contains the two 0-ary (zero-one valued) constant functions. <p> We reduce the DNF TAU TOLOGY problem to MEMBERSHIP for C. DNF TAUTOLOGY Instance: A Boolean function f in DNF. Question: Is f 1? DNF TAUTOLOGY is co-NP complete, as its complementary problem - DNF NON-TAUTOLOGY is known to be NP-complete <ref> [7] </ref>. The reduction from DNF TAUTOLOGY to MEMBERSHIP for C is as follows. Let l 1 be an integer such that F l n C l 6= ; (guaranteed by point (iii) of the definition), and let h (y) 2 F l n C l be in DNF. <p> That is, f 1 if and only if g 2 C n+l , which completes the proof. Notice that as DNF TAUTOLOGY remains co-NP-complete even when restricted to instances in 3-DNF <ref> [7] </ref> if we have a function not in C that can be represented in k-DNF, then the above argument gives that the MEMBERSHIP problem for C remains co-NP-hard even when restricted to instances in maxfk; 3g-DNF. 4. <p> Corollary 4.15. THRESHOLD NUMBER is not in NP [ co-NP unless NP = co-NP: Corollary 4.16. [6] OPTIMAL THRESHOLD DECOMPOSITION is NP-hard. Moreover, using the fixed-parameter hardness results from Theorem 4.12 and standard arguments from <ref> [7] </ref>, one can show that the optimal threshold decomposition cannot be efficiently approximated (with respect to the number of elements) within any constant factor &lt; 3 2 unless P = NP.

Reference-contexts: It is known that if a monotone function h is a halfspace, then also h (gr) is a (graphic) halfspace (this follows from Theorem 10.4 in <ref> [8] </ref>; another proof is given in [23]). Now assume that a graphic function f is a union of l halfspaces, i.e., let f = f 1 _ _ f l , where the f i 's are halfspaces. <p> It remains to show that for any fixed k 3 the UNION OF k HALFSPACES problem with instances in monotone 2-DNF is in NP. 11 Using Theorem 10.4 from <ref> [8] </ref> and some standard bounds on the size of weights required to represent halfspaces [18, 17], it can be shown that a graphic function f 2 F n is a (graphic) halfspace if and only if there exist non-negative integers w 1 ; . . . ; w n ; t

Reference-contexts: As f is a monotone function, without loss of generality the f i 's can be also assumed to be monotone <ref> [9] </ref>. Then we have f = f 1 _ _ f l , where f (gr) (gr) l are graphic halfspaces, which completes the proof of the claim. <p> The NP-hardness result for part (ii) follows from Theorem 4.11. Using the fact that for any l 1, the threshold number of the function y 1 y 2 _ y 3 y 4 _ . . . y 2l1 y 2l 2 F 2l is exactly l <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, all hardness results can be shown to remain valid even when the problems are restricted to instances in 3-DNF. <p> Proof: As both NP and co-NP are closed under p m reductions, no NP-hard problem can be in co-NP unless NP = co-NP, and no co-NP-hard problem can be in NP unless NP = co-NP. We now turn our attention to the following optimization problem (considered in <ref> [9] </ref>). 12 OPTIMAL THRESHOLD DECOMPOSITION Instance: A Boolean function f in DNF. Task: Find an optimal threshold decomposition for f . This problem is related to the decision problem THRESHOLD NUMBER Instance: A Boolean function f in DNF and an integer K.

The restriction to maxfk + 1; 3g-DNF is implied by the fact that the k + 1-ary parity function is of threshold order k + 1 [24]. To show that k-THRESHOLD ORDER RECOGNITION is in co-NP, a generalization of the above approach for halfspaces, i.e., for the case k = 1, can be used. <p> Once again, a negation argument gives that the version of k-THRESHOLD ORDER RECOGNITION with instances in CNF is also co-NP-complete, as it is known that f is of threshold order k if and only if its negation is of threshold order k <ref> [24] </ref>. A further natural geometrically defined class of functions could be the class of balls. However, it turns out that in our setting this class is identical to the class of halfspaces (we observe this identity because of the analogous binary classes considered later).
