Title: Vehicle to Vehicle RF Propagation Measurements  
Date: Chapter 3  
Pubnum: 29  
Abstract: This chapter presents results from vehicle to vehicle RF propagation measurements in the 900 MHz band focusing on determining delay spread, probability distribution parameters (in particular, the Rician K factor) and path loss rates. The parameters and results are discussed with implications for the use of RF communication between automobiles in Intelligent Vehicle/Highway Systems (IVHS).

Reference-contexts: Contrary to anticipation, however, were occasional measured K factors around 1.5 (the lowest was 1.38). Recall that the K factor represents the ratio of the received LOS component to the received scattered components. This concept of K factor, first put forth in <ref> [13] </ref>, is very difficult to measure in a physically meaningful manner; i.e., by isolating the direct signal from the scattered components.

In this report, this effect is lumped with multipath fading (explained next). 3.2.1.4 Multipath Fading The base stations in PATH IVHS are assumed to be transmitting to vehicles within distances on the order of a few hundred meters. <p> In this chapter, only narrowband channels are considered. This 34 implies that the interarrival times of the reected waves are small compared to the variations in the modulating signal. The reected waves hence add coherently. RMS delay spreads on the order of 1 ns have been computed <ref> [15] </ref> for the IVHS environment at carrier frequencies around 1800 MHz. The coherence bandwidth is hence around 100 MHz. Given the assumption of bit rates of up to 80 kHz between vehicles and base stations, the narrow-band assumption is reasonable. <p> of being in the antennas far field was a pri 900 MHz Network Analyzer GP-IB Portable PC DEC T x Antenna R x Antenna 39 mary reason for why measurements significantly closer (than 6 feet) were not taken. 3.3.2 Delay Spread Delay spread was measured using the technique presented in <ref> [15] </ref>. There are two interesting issues to note with the delay spread measurements in this experiment. First, the RMS delay spreads are, quite reasonably, very small. <p> As shown in Fig. 3.4, the RMS delay spread has an oscillating pattern and no four consecutive points can be connected by a monotonic curve. Referring to the concurrent indoor measurements done as part of this experiment as well as those of others <ref> [15, 18] </ref>, it should be noted that this is uncharacteristic.

Reference-contexts: Free-space loss is experienced if where represents the distance from the transmitter, is the wavelength of the carrier wave, and & are respectively the heights of the receiving and transmitting antennas. Harley <ref> [20] </ref> suggested a smooth transition, with (1) where is the normalized turn over distance, and is the local-mean power (i.e., received power averaged over a few meters). Studies done by [15] indicate that actual turn over distances on the order of 800 meters are reasonable around 2 GHz. <p> Various models have been proposed, e.g. a step-wise transition from b 1 = 2 to b 2 = 4 (empirical values) at a certain (turnover) distance d g . Harleys <ref> [20] </ref> smooth transition, has been described earlier. However when the distance between the receiver and antenna is small and unobstructed the direct line-of-sight component and the ground reected component will cause strong uctuations in the received signal power due to mutual interference between these two waves.

Reference-contexts: The coherence bandwidth is hence around 100 MHz. Given the assumption of bit rates of up to 80 kHz between vehicles and base stations, the narrow-band assumption is reasonable. RMS delay spreads longer than 1 ns have been reported; e.g., 300 ns is reported for small city microcells <ref> [22] </ref>. The narrowband assumption is still valid for this value. Rician fading occurs in a channel if the central limit theorem can be applied to the reected waves. This in turn only occurs if the number of reected waves is large, and none of them dominates the joint reected power.
