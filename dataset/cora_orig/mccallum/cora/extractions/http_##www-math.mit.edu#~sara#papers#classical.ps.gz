Reference-contexts: The starting point for this more general theory is a construction of Schubert classes by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand <ref> [1] </ref> and 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 05E15, Secondary 14M15. Key words and phrases. Schubert polynomials, flag varieties, cohomology. First author supported by the National Physical Science Consortium, IBM and UCSD. Second author supported in part by N.S.F. grant number DMS-9119355 1 2 SARA BILLEY AND MARK HAIMAN Demazure [4]. <p> The general theory applies to any connected and simply connected semisimple complex Lie group G, but we make things fully explicit only for the classical families. Primary references are <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G. Abstractly, the flag variety is the space of cosets X = G=B = fgB j g 2 Gg, which is a smooth complex projective variety. For the classical groups, the flag varieties have the following more concrete descriptions. <p> Let w 0 denote the longest element of W . Then by <ref> [1] </ref>, Corollary 3.19, we have C w 0 w C w = C w 0 , and C v C w = 0 for l (v) + l (w) = l (w 0 ) and v 6= w. <p> Namely, c w uv is the intersection number of cycles equivalent to X w 0 u , X w 0 v , and X w in general position. As in <ref> [1] </ref>, Proposition 1.3, we identify the rational cohomology ring H fl (X) with the quotient Q [P ]=I of the symmetric algebra of the root space P by the ideal I generated by all non-constant homogeneous W -invariant polynomials. <p> For each simple root ff and corresponding reflection ff , we then define the divided difference operator @ ff on Q [P ] as in <ref> [1] </ref> by f ff f :(2.13) 8 SARA BILLEY AND MARK HAIMAN If ff g = g then clearly @ ff (gf ) = g@ ff f , which shows that the operators @ ff carry the ideal I into itself, and therefore induce well-defined operators @ ff on H fl <p> Theorem 3.14 of <ref> [1] </ref> states that the Schubert classes C w satisfy @ ff C w = &lt; C w ff if l (w ff ) &lt; l (w) (2.14) These equations, together with their dimensions and the fact that C 1 = 1, determine the classes C w . <p> Identifying the Weyl group W 0 with the subgroup of W generated by f ff j ff 2 Sg, is W 0 -equivariant. The isomorphisms Q [P ]=I ~ = H fl (G=B) of <ref> [1] </ref> commute with the maps ~ fl : H fl (G=B) ! H fl (G 0 =B 0 ) induced by ~ : G 0 =B 0 ! G=B and ~ : Q [P ]=I ! Q [P 0 ]=I 0 induced by : P ! P 0 . <p> The embedding sends Schubert classes to Schubert classes, so we may identify the Schubert polynomials for G=P with those Schubert polynomials for X which are W P invariant (see <ref> [1] </ref> for details). For isotropic Grassmanians, W P is S n , so the relevant Schubert polynomials B w , C w , or D w are the ones indexed by signed permutations w with w (i) &lt; w (i + 1) for all i.

Reference-contexts: One is an analog of the Billey-Jockusch-Stanley formula, while the other, which has no counterpart in the SL (n) theory, expresses our polynomials in terms of SL (n) Schu-bert polynomials and Schur Q- or P -functions. Our second formula involves the `shifted Edelman-Greene correspondences' introduced in <ref> [9] </ref>. The mysterious `third' correspondence found in that paper (and inappropriately called "type C" there) turns out to be the natural correspondence for the family D n of even orthogonal groups. <p> Thus we recover the theorems of Pragacz. 3. The shifted Edelman-Greene correspondence In this section we review the shifted Edelman-Greene correspondences from <ref> [9] </ref> and use them to define symmetric functions associated with elements of the Weyl groups B n and D n . These symmetric functions are the natural B n and D n analogs of symmetric functions defined for elements of A n by Stanley [17]. <p> This proves the proposition. Having completed our review of Q- and P -functions, we turn to the Edelman-Greene correspondences and associated Stanley functions. We treat B n first since everything we need is proven in <ref> [9] </ref>; for D n we will have to add something. SCHUBERT POLYNOMIALS FOR THE CLASSICAL GROUPS 13 Definition. <p> Finally, we have P (a) = P ((a)) for the peak sets. Proof. All but the part about peak sets is proved in Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 6.3 of <ref> [9] </ref>. For the peak set part it suffices to show P (T ) = P (^p (T )) for T of shape fi n . <p> In <ref> [9] </ref> it is shown that T ! ^p (T ) defines a bijection from standard tableaux of shape ffi n to winnowed words for the longest element of B n and conjectured that initial segments of ^p (T ) determine the corresponding initial segments of T . <p> Then the number e X (a)=S where o (a) denotes the total number of 1's and ^ 1's in a, depends only on w and on the shape of S. Finally, we have P (a) = P ((a)) for the peak sets. Proof. The bijection is Theorem 5.16 of <ref> [9] </ref>, since we now know that flattened words and winnowed words are the same. The peak set statement follows exactly as in Proposition 3.3 above. <p> For the assertion about initial segments, we show that whenever bc and bc 0 are flattened words for the longest element, with common initial segment b, then c and c 0 are connected by a chain of S n Coxeter relations. This given, the proof of Proposition 6.1 in <ref> [9] </ref> applies, with one change. Namely, for the argument involving the Coxeter relation 121 $ 212 to SCHUBERT POLYNOMIALS FOR THE CLASSICAL GROUPS 17 go through, when the two flattened words are b121 and b212, their corresponding tableaux must differ only in the largest three entries. <p> But this is shown by the proof of Proposition 5.15 in <ref> [9] </ref>. Now consider two flattened words bc and bc 0 . Treating them as winnowed words, note that a winnowed word can be canonically un-winnowed by inserting a 0 at the beginning, and after every 1 that represents a first visit. <p> Let a be a reduced word for w with (a) = S and let b be the corresponding flattened word. Note that S is really a function of b and is the initial segment of any tableau corresponding to an extension of b. By Lemma 5.2 of <ref> [9] </ref>, if we extend S to a tableau T of shape ffi n , and let T 0 be the corresponding extension of S 0 , then ^p (T ) and ^p (T 0 ) differ by a certain substitution in the positions corresponding to the segment involved in the elementary <p> The complete list of possible substitutions is given in Table 5 of <ref> [9] </ref>. All but two of these substitutions are special cases of S n Coxeter relations other than 121 $ 212. <p> For this purpose we must extract a concept which is implicit in the proof of Proposition 3.9. We define flattened words b and b 0 to be dual equivalent if they are connected by a chain of substitutions from Table 5 of <ref> [9] </ref>. The proof of Proposition 3.9 shows that b and b 0 are then flattened words for the same elements w, and that the map is a bijection from each dual equivalence class to the set of all standard tableaux of some shape . <p> We have D (a) = D ((a)) for the descent sets. Definition. Let v be an element of S n . The Stanley function G v (X) is defined by G v (X) = v s (X);(3.14) where s denotes the usual Schur S-function. Proposition 3.15 is proved in <ref> [9] </ref>, where it is also shown that the above definition of S n Stanley functions agrees with the original definition in [17]. (In [17], and also in Chapter 7 of [13], where G v is shown to be a `stable' Schubert polynomial of type A, G v and g v are

Reference-contexts: It can be made even more explicit by selecting a specific polynomial to represent the top cohomology class. At first glance one sees no preferred way of making this choice. For the groups SL (n; C ), however, Lascoux and Schutzenberger <ref> [12] </ref> made the crucial observation that one particular choice yields Schubert polynomials that represent the Schubert classes simultaneously for all n.

In [12] it is shown that S w is well-defined by (4.2), independent of n, and satisfies the defining recurrence (2.2). For complete details, see Chapter 4 of <ref> [13] </ref>. Theorems 3A and 4A involve `admissible monomial' forms of formulas (2.5) and (2.8), derived from formulas (3.6) and (3.11) and the admissible monomial formula for type A Schubert polynomials, (4.5) below.

The lemma follows by induction from the transition equation for Schubert polynomials of type A, formula (4.16) of <ref> [13] </ref>. Lemma 4.12.

The following well-known basic facts can be derived (albeit with some effort) from various theorems and exercises in <ref> [14] </ref>. Proposition 3.1.
