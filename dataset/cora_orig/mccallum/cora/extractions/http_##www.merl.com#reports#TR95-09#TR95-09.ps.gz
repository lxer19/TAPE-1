Reference-contexts: The question of complexity then reduces to how many priority levels are required in a practical environment and how to implement a fast enough comparator for that many levels. Fortunately, silicon implementations that support a separate priority for every cell in a queue are beginning to emerge <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. However, there has been very little research on the larger question of how many priority levels are needed in a practical network in a demanding environment, especially with hard real-time connections and a lot of audio and video.

Second International Workshop on Protocols for High-Speed Networks, </booktitle> <address> Palo Alto, </address> <month> November </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: There are many theoretical solutions to aspects of this problem, especially for allocating bandwidth and buffer space in order to ensure bounded delay, given a priori knowledge of the characteristics of the traffic on each critical connection <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. ATM networks are particularly attractive for implementing such solutions because connections can be controlled to enforce those traffic characteristics. One kind of resource receives very little attention in traditional LANs, namely redundant paths for fault tolerance.

Reference-contexts: The distributed shared memory updating processes and the variable bandwidth of compressed video create transients in the available bandwidth that are much shorter than the response times of rate-based ow control algorithms. This is considered in more detail in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As with switches, the number of priority levels needed in network interfaces in a practical network is still an open question. Traffic Characteristics and Flow Control Traffic in most computer networks is extremely bursty and has been characterized as self-similar <ref> [5] </ref>, but in industrial environments it is worse. For example, in a typical system, distributed real-time processes maintain a consistent model of the state of the plant through distributed, reective, shared memory.
