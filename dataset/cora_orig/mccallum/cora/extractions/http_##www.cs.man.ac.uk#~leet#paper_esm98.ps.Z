Abstract: This paper presents experiments with a Nomad 200 mobile robot, acquiring a sensor model of a specific environment and using this model to predict robot-environment interaction. Data obtained by operating the real robot in the real target environment is used to train a set of 16 artificial neural networks which can later be used to model robot-environment interaction and predict the behaviour of the real robot in off-line simulation. A number of experimental results are presented, demonstrating that this approach can be used to model sensory perception of a mobile robot, as well as to model the behaviour of a specific robot in its target environment.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this, 16 multi-layer perceptrons were used: one to model each sonar sensor. In neural network theory, it is well known that a two-hidden-layer structure can learn arbitrary curves <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. The total number of hidden units we have tried ranges from 10 to 200. As a compromise between learning time and accuracy, each network has 50 hidden units in two layers, two input units and one output unit (see figure 2). <p> Using the minimum error obtained when training the network, using the training data, does not necessarily result in a low general error when the network model is actually applied to other test data due to the effect of over-training. Following the procedure widely used by co-workers (for example, <ref> [1] </ref>) we therefore obtained a second set of data, validation data, which was used to determine the optimal point at which to stop training the network.

However, typical robot environments are not uniform and cannot be modelled faithfully using this approach. The result of such modelling, therefore, is that simulation results can only be transferred to real robot controls in very simple cases.

Reference-contexts: In our approach, instead of storing the interaction as a look-up table [10], we are using a neural network training method to generalise the relation between robot's environmental perceptions and its locations <ref> [9] </ref>. Compared with using look-up tables, a neural network approach does not require curve-fitting techniques to generate data between samples. This neural network model is later used for simulation of the robot's behaviour in the target environment.
