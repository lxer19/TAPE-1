Definition 5.1. Consider F n with the multiplication fl as an F-algebra. Let K be an F-algebra. Let ' : K ! F n be a morphism of F-algebras. Let C = (C r ) r2N 0 be a sequence of linear codes in F n 0 . <p> Either Condition (A:4) or (A:5) is superfluous, <ref> [15] </ref>. Condition (A:6) implies that f'(f i g j ) j i; j 2 Ng generates F n . Definition 5.3. <p> If moreover F = F 0 , then the s th generalized weight of C r is at least ffi F R (r + s 1). Proof. See <ref> [11, 9, 15, 20] </ref>. Example 5.5. Geometric Goppa or algebraic-geometric codes. Let F be a finite field and let F 0 = F. <p> Then N r = f (i; j) 2 N 2 j i + j = r+1 g and n r r + 1 g if r g, and equality holds in case r &gt; 3g 2. See <ref> [15, 20] </ref> for more properties of the FR bound in terms of the semigroup of non-gaps at P . The Goppa bound of C r is defined by r + 1 g for r g and denoted by ffi (r). <p> See [15, 20] for more properties of the FR bound in terms of the semigroup of non-gaps at P .

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we give several formulations of independent sets for the definition of the shift bound for cyclic codes. With this last reformulation we obtained, in cooperation with Shen and Tzeng <ref> [25] </ref>, a generalization of the definition of independent sets and the shift bound for arbitrary linear codes in Section 3. It appears that all these bounds give a method for finding non-singular square submatrices of a matrix of syndromes. <p> In a discussion with B.-Z. Shen we came to the following generalization of independent sets and the shift bound, see also Shen and Tzeng <ref> [25] </ref> and Augot, Charpin and Sendrier [1] on generalized Newton identities. Definition 3.1. Let N = N or N = f1; : : :; lg for some l 2 N. Let R be a subset of N 2 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we survey various bounds on the minimum distance of cyclic and algebraic-geometric codes. For cyclic codes the BCH, Hartmann-Tzeng <ref> [12, 27] </ref>, Roos [22] and the shift bound of van Lint, Wilson and van Eupen [7, 16] for the minimum distance are well known. In Section 2 we give several formulations of independent sets for the definition of the shift bound for cyclic codes.

Reference-contexts: Wei <ref> [28] </ref> has defined the notion of generalized weights of a linear code which is a generalization of the minimum distance. A simple observation leads to a bound for the r th generalized weight of C (J) without any extra costs. Definition 4.1.

Reference-contexts: Write r + 1 = ae (q 1) + with ae; 2 N 0 such that &lt; q 1. Then the minimum distance of the dual of RM q (r; m) is equal to ( + 1)q ae , see <ref> [2, 13, 29] </ref> and also [16]. Remark that '(f ) = '(f q ).

Reference-contexts: Majority coset decoding decodes up to half the FR bound. We will generalize this decoding algorithm for the shift bound in Section 6. Example 5.6. Hermitian codes. It follows from the work of Yang, Kumar and Stichtenoth <ref> [30] </ref> that the s th generalized weights of the code C r on the Hermitian curve is equal to ffi F R (r + s 1), see also Munuera [18]. Finally we compare the FR bound with the shift bound. Definition 5.7.
