Title: Quality Management of Information Systems Development

Abstract: The role of the systems analyst in the implementation process has changed dramatically in recent times because of changes to organisational boundaries, the need to align IT with business objectives and the complexity of the systems now required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing environment and being involved in multi-organisational structures. Establishing strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding of the implementation process. Implementation is concerned with behavioural phenomena since people are involved from the inception of the idea, as well as being involved in the development process. They are also affected by the changes which the new system brings to the organisation. The research is attempting to understand the critical factors associated with the implementation process and consequently develop an appropriate model.

Using a Quality Function Deployment <ref> (Bossert 1991) </ref> approach to deploying process quality could be successful. (b) considering how team and individual activities influence the process and looking at reward systems; (c) considering the most efficient way of deploying analysts within business groups; 8 (d) reviewing and assessing the performance of the process using measurements of success.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In a study conducted by Broadbent et al <ref> [5] </ref> in 1990 of Information Systems Managers of over 200 large Australian and New Zealand private and public sector organisations, there were some interesting findings: a.

Reference-contexts: It is also proposed that for organisations which are going through considerable change, an adaptable process model is more appropriate than more formal, static approaches. 3. Research Method In this research I have chosen to use a subjective/argumentative approach <ref> [7] </ref> because I am interested in the interviewees opinion and this is very difficult to ascertain via a survey. This is also appropriate because the interviews were semi structured and were generally with an individual. <p> Almost all of the people interviewed had not formally measured the performance of the process they used, and some had not given any consideration to it at all. This confirms Galliers <ref> (1987) </ref> results. The need for a process model which takes into consideration behavioural factors was confirmed and this will be formulated in the future. 12

Reference-contexts: Bias from the interviewer was minimised by allowing the discussion to be controlled by the interviewee. Directed questions were avoided to allow the interviewees beliefs to be unsolicited. The method applied was based on the techniques described by Keats <ref> [9] </ref>. All interviews were recorded on audio tape. Some data analysis took place after initial interviews and as a result questions were modified and others included. This technique is described in Yin [13]. The transcripts were analysed to reduce them to a manageable size.

Reference-contexts: In one of the interviews there was an IS manager and a senior analyst and in another interview there was a senior consultant and a consultant. The research paradigm being used is therefore interpretivist <ref> [10] </ref>. The data collected was qualitative concerning the way people work, their beliefs, attitudes and expectations. The work that analysts are involved in cannot be studied outside of the social context and culture of organisations. The intentions were determined from discussions with analysts through semi-structured interviews.

Reference-contexts: So an understanding of the critical success factors associated with the implementation process is very important particularly to those analysts who may be relatively inexperienced with the process. The critical success factor (CSF) analysis method was extolled by Rockart in 1979 <ref> [12] </ref>. It was originally designed to help executives define their information needs. The knowledge of these factors may also assist analysts in providing quality assurance to the process. Quality assurance comes from understanding what the performance indicators are for the critical success factors and measuring these throughout the process.

Some data analysis took place after initial interviews and as a result questions were modified and others included. This technique is described in Yin <ref> [13] </ref>. The transcripts were analysed to reduce them to a manageable size. The interviews were each about one hour and this transcribed to between 10 to 15 pages of text. Altogether there was approximately 400 pages to be analysed.
