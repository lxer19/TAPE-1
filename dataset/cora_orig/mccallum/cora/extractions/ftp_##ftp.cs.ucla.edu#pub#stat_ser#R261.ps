Reference-contexts: If we let the set of conditional probabilities P (yjpa Y ) be represented by a vector p (of dimensionality 2 k ), and P (s) by a vector q, then the relation between q is p is linear and can be represented as a matrix multiplication <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994b] </ref> p = Rq (65) where R is a 0-1 matrix, with dimension 2 k fijSj. Thus, a sufficient condition for identification is simply that R, together with the normalizing equation P j q j = 1, be invertible.

This objection can be diffused by placing x and u in two remote locations and tossing the coin a split second after the bet is placed, but before any light ray could arrive from the betting room to the coin-tossing room. <p> The manufacturer counter argues by stating that: (1) counterfactual speculations regarding whether patients would or would not have died, are purely metaphysical and should be avoided <ref> [Dawid, 1997] </ref>, and (2) nonexperimental data should be dismissed a priori, on the ground that such data may be highly biased; for example, incurable terminal patients might be more inclined to use drug x if it provides them greater symptomatic relief.

Reference-contexts: This stands in contrast with some theories of probabilistic causality which attempt to avoid deterministic mechanisms by conditioning all probabilities on "the state of the world just before" the occurrence of the cause in question (x) (e.g., <ref> [Good, 1961] </ref>). In the betting story above, the intention is to condition all probabilities on the state of the coin (u), but it is not fulfilled if the coin is tossed after the bet is placed.

Reference-contexts: Susceptibility is defined as the proportion of persons who possess "an underlying factor sufficient to make a person contract a disease following exposure" <ref> [Khoury et al., 1989] </ref>. PS offers a formal counterfac-tual interpretation of susceptibility, which sharpens this definition and renders susceptibility amenable to systematic analysis. <p> Substituting (34) into (33) yields y x = y x 0 _ (y x ^ y 0 12 Monotonicity is not mentioned in <ref> [Khoury et al., 1989] </ref>, but it must have been assumed implicitly to make their derivations valid. 16 Taking the probability of (35), and using the disjointness of y x 0 and y 0 x 0 , we obtain: P (y x ) = P (y x 0 ) + P (y

Reference-contexts: A broader identification condition can be obtained through the use of the back-door and front-door criteria <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref>, which are applicable to semi-Markovian models. These were further generalized in Galles and Pearl (1995) 13 and lead to the following corollary: Corollary 2 Let GP be the class of semi-Markovian models that satisfy the graphical criterion of Galles and Pearl (1995). <p> This adjustment formula, which follows from Eq. (43), is correct regardless of the mechanisms mediating X and Y , provided only that W represents all common factors affecting X and Y <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref>. Theorem 4 instructs us to evaluate PN and PS by substituting (56) into Eqs. (38) and (39), respectively, and it assures us that the resulting expressions constitute consistent estimates of PN and PS.

Reference-contexts: y, that is, the output of every link in the chain is counterfactually dependent on its input. 17 Such a chain does not exist for switch-2, since it is disconnected when both switches are on. 17 An alternative way of enriching the counterfactual account with structural information in proposed in <ref> [Pearl, 1998] </ref>. 29 Lewis' proposal retains the connection between actual causation and counterfactuation, but it fails to accept the simple case where the two switches are connected symmetrically, and each participates equally in energizing the light bulb.

Reference-contexts: Although the counterfactual concept of necessary cause (i.e., that an outcome would not have occurred `but for' the action) is predominant in legal settings <ref> [Robertson, 1997] </ref> and in ordinary discourse, the sufficiency component of causation has a definite influence on causal thoughts. The sufficiency component plays a major role in scientific and legal explanations, as can be seen from examples where the necessary component is dormant.

Reference-contexts: Eq. (17) has been given a variety of (equivalent) definitions and interpretations. Epidemiologists refer to this condition as "no-confounding" <ref> [Robins and Greenland, 1989] </ref>, statisticians call it "as if randomized," and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) call it "ignorability." A graphical criterion ensuring exogeneity is the absence of a common ancestor of X and Y in G (M ).

Reference-contexts: The expression for PS (Eq. (22)), likewise, is quite revealing: P S = [P (yjx) P (yjx 0 )]=[1 P (yjx 0 )]; (32) as it coincide with what epidemiologists call the "relative difference" <ref> [Shep, 1958] </ref>, which is used to measure the susceptibility of a population to a risk factor x. Susceptibility is defined as the proportion of persons who possess "an underlying factor sufficient to make a person contract a disease following exposure" [Khoury et al., 1989].
