Abstract: An important research issue in ATM networks is the interaction between the congestion control mechanisms for the ABR service and that embedded in the data transport protocols such as TCP. In this paper we examine the behaviour of TCP traffic over ABR service, and in particular, we compare the simulation results in two scenarios: one with per VC Credit Based flow control and round-robin servicing (FCVC/RR), and one with round-robin but no flow control (non-FC VC/RR). Our simulation results show a marked difference in TCP round trip time (RTT). Our experiment also shows that although FCVC prevents losses inside the network, losses still occur at the edges. To prevent losses at the edge, fundamental changes are needed in TCP to take advantage of the back-pressure signal used in FCVC. Our extensive simulation results show that TCP performs better under non-FCVC/RR.

Reference-contexts: It is envisaged that the majority of the data application or best-effort traffic such as the TCP/IP traffic in the Internet, will be carried over ABR service in ATM networks. There are a number of studies published in the literature about best-effort traffic over high speed networks <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and TCP traffic dynamics over ATM networks [3]. Much of these work has focused on the throughput problems introduced by the interaction of datagram network applications and non-flow controlled plain ATM network.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of studies published in the literature about best-effort traffic over high speed networks [1, 2] and TCP traffic dynamics over ATM networks <ref> [3] </ref>. Much of these work has focused on the throughput problems introduced by the interaction of datagram network applications and non-flow controlled plain ATM network. Two flow control schemes were proposed in the ATM Forum for supporting ABR service: rate based flow control and credit based flow control. <p> Overall, the credit based schemes such as FCVC display good protection against misbehaved end system. 2.3 Other work in congestion control for ABR service Several other approaches have also been considered for congestion control for ABR services such as large buffers. Studies [11] <ref> [3] </ref> show that high layer protocols do not handle the congestion well enough to achieve the desired performance. With careful examination, it is not difficult to discover that the problem is not only to do with high level protocols alone. <p> In many respects building a new network with some effective yet simple 7/4 improvements such as early packet discarding (EPD) in the switches can greatly enhance the high layer protocol performance and overcome the shortcomings <ref> [3] </ref>. This observation and some features in FCVC such as fairness and protection against ill-behaved end systems motivated us to carry the following simulation studies. 3. Simulations In this section we describe the simulation settings for our experiments.

Reference-contexts: We then compare the two schemes and discuss their limitations. 2.1 Rate Based Flow Control Rate based schemes make use of feedback information from the network to adjust the rate that the source of each virtual connection (VC) can send cells to the network. Forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) <ref> [4] </ref> uses the payload type identifier (PTI) in data cells to carry congestion information. The explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI) in the PTI marked by a congested switch is forwarded to destination.

Reference-contexts: The explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI) in the PTI marked by a congested switch is forwarded to destination. This information is then sent back in a resource management cell (RM) to the source of the VC to be used for adjusting the rate. Backward explicit congestion notification (BECN) <ref> [5] </ref> differs from FECN in that the congestion switch generates RM cells and sends to the source of VCs. BECN has advantages of fast response and fault tolerant against some end system abnormalities.

Reference-contexts: Both FECN and BECN belong to the negative feedback class which may fail to operate when RM cells encounter heavy congestion on feedback routes. The proportional rate control algorithm (PRCA) <ref> [6] </ref> is designed to overcome such control failure by changing the philosophy to positive feedback.

Reference-contexts: This famous beat down problem can cause severe unfairness among VCs. More recently an adaptive proportional rate control APRC <ref> [7] </ref> was proposed at ATM forum. APRC uses a special type of RM cells which constantly travel between the source and destination of VCs.

Reference-contexts: This RM cell carries modified allowed cell rate (ACR) information generated by switches which filters the traffic to estimate the optimal rate for adjusting the VC source cell rate. A more detailed description and performance analysis of APRC can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 7/3 2.2 Credit Based Flow Control Credit based flow control schemes operate a link-by-link control by using the information contained in a credit cell (a special RM cell) returned from the receiver to the sender on each link. <p> A number of modifications and some enhancements are proposed to address the shortcomings for both schemes following the ATM forum vote in favour of the rate based flow control <ref> [8] </ref> [10]. We note, however, in all rate based schemes, cell loss cannot be avoid because of the imprecise nature of rate adaptation and over allocation in order to achieve high link utilisation.

Reference-contexts: It adjusts the number of cells to be sent to the receiver to meet the its ability to accept new cells hence avoiding buffer overflow. The Flow Controlled Virtual Connections (FCVC) <ref> [9] </ref> mechanism proposed in the ATM forum consists of a credit update protocol (CUP), a per VC credit buffer allocation and an improved buffer management to reduce the memory requirement. The core of FCVC is around its CUP: for a VC, a credit balance is maintained for each cell sent. <p> The switch has round robin service discipline for each output port and it scans each non-empty VC (with positive credit balance in FCVC scenario) at every cell transmission time interval. The CUP used in our FCVC simulation is of N23 <ref> [9] </ref> with received end performing credit adaptation.

Reference-contexts: We then compare its simulation results with the model with a similar configuration but with the link-by-link flow control function removed. Although we have conducted our simulation in several topologies such as those suggested in the ATM forums Generic Flow Control Fairness Configuration (GFC) <ref> [12] </ref>, the results presented in this paper are drown from a simple chain configuration and a reduced GFC for concise presentation ( Figure 1 ).

Reference-contexts: To make FCVC and TCP cooperate with each other, fundamental changes are needed for TCP to take advantage of the back-pressure signal used in FCVC. On the other hand, since TCP congestion control in the forms of slow start <ref> [13] </ref> and fast retransmission [14] was designed on the assumption that the network may not provide any explicit congestion signal, it works well when there is no congestion control underneath. Our simulation results show that TCP performs extremely well in the non-FCVC/RR scenario.

Conclusion and Future Work Our conclusion from the simulation study is that current TCP with round-robin in the ATM network should provide an adequate congestion control for ABR service in ATM networks.
