Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 1.1 The Purpose of this Report KIT is a verified operating system kernel <ref> [Bevier 87] </ref>. This technical report contains all the definitions and shells provided to the Boyer-Moore theorem prover in the specification and definition of KIT. The 1 events are given in the order they are presented to the theorem prover. <p> are defined in the Boyer-Moore logic, and the proof is mechanically checked with the Boyer-Moore theorem prover 1 Any extension to the logic presented to the theorem prover, e.g., an axiom, lemma, definition or shell, is called an event. 2 [Boyer 79]. 1.2.2 The KIT Proof Structure The KIT report <ref> [Bevier 87] </ref> contains a detailed description of the specification, implementation and verification of KIT. We let a brief outline of the structure of the proof suffice here. The main result in the verification of KIT is the theorem OS-IMPLEMENTS-PARALLEL-TASKS.
