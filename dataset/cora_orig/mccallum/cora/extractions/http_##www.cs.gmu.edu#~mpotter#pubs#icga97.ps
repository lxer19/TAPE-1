Abstract: In this paper we develop an empirical methodology for studying the behavior of evolutionary algorithms based on problem generators. We then describe three generators that can be used to study the effects of epistasis on the performance of EAs. Finally, we illustrate the use of these ideas in a preliminary exploration of the effects of epistasis on simple GAs.

There has also been some discussion about improving our empirical tools, mostly along the lines of improved test suites. One of the recurring criticisms of current test suites is that they do not contain many instances of non-separable problems (Salomon 1996).

Reference-contexts: A classical example of this is a study in which a new algorithm is carefully tuned to the point that it outperforms some existing algorithms on a few problems, for example, the De Jong test suite <ref> (De Jong 1975) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They are known to be NP-complete and are frequently used as the canonical representative of this class of difficult problems <ref> (De Jong and Spears 1989) </ref>. The most general statement of SAT problems is: given an arbitrary boolean expression involving V boolean variables, find an assignment of truth values to the V boolean variables that makes the entire boolean expression true.

Reference-contexts: that allow for a more systematic study of epistasis, and we illustrate their use in understanding better the effects of epistasis on GAs. 3 An NK Landscape Generator The most obvious candidate for a problem generator to study the effects of epistasis is Kauffman's tunable NK model of fitness landscapes <ref> (Kauffman 1989) </ref>. In the NK model, N represents the number of genes in a haploid chromosome and K represents the number of linkages each gene has to other genes in the same chromosome.

Reference-contexts: Figures 1-3 illustrate typical results for low (K = 4), medium (K = 12), and high (K = 24) epistasis, with a population size of 200. The vertical bars overlaying the best-so-far curves represent 95-percent confidence intervals computed from Student's t-statistic <ref> (Miller 1986) </ref>. As expected, one can see a clearly diminishing advantage of crossover over mutation as the amount of epis-tasis increases. However, there were several surprising results. Note that the standard GA is consistently outperformed by GA-c, and isn't much better than GA-m.

Reference-contexts: One such generator that has this property is referred to as Random L-SAT <ref> (Mitchell, Selman, and Levesque 1992) </ref>, which we now describe in more detail. The Random L-SAT problem generator creates random problems in conjunctive normal form subject to the three parameters V , C, and L.

One of the recurring criticisms of current test suites is that they do not contain many instances of non-separable problems <ref> (Salomon 1996) </ref>. Hence, EAs with strong biases to search along coordinate axes perform better than other EAs on such "impoverished" test suites. While we share such concerns, we feel there is more that needs to be done than just adding a few more problems to existing test suites.
