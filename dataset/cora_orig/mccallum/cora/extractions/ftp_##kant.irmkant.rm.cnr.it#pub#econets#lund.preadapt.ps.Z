Abstract: Populations of artificial neural networks with individual evolvable fitness formulae are shown to be pre-adapted to environments different from those in which they evolved. An analysis of the neural network units explains the behavioral strategies, i.e. the specialization to specific ecological niches, and how the organisms are able to make sudden changes in ecological niche preference. Pre-adaptation to new habitats is also found in the biological nature. Parallels between the emergence of speciation modeled by sympatric speciation via habitat specialization in biological organisms and the change in ecological niche preference in populations of artificial neural networks are drawn.
