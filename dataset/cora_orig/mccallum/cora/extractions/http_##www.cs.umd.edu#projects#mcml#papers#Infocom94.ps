Title: Effect of Topology on Performance of Reliable Multicast Communication  
Author: Pravin Bhagwat Partho P. Mishra Satish K. Tripathi 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the performance implications of providing reliability in conjunction with mul-ticast transport over a high speed wide area network. We use a block based acknowledgement and selective retransmission protocol to evaluate the impact of the loss rate and the multicast tree topology on the achievable throughput. Our results show that even when the buffer overflow probability at switches and receivers is low, the cumulative loss probability seen by a source may be quite high. We also demonstrate that the average throughput increases significantly if the transport protocol delivers packets to the application layer out-of-sequence. We investigate the scaling properties of the error control mechanism and show that the mul-ticast tree topology that results in minimum transfer time is not necessarily the same as the one constructed using minimal bandwidth or shortest path algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The use of such a multicast paradigm requires the reevaluation of certain design choices originally made in the context of applications involving using a one-to-one communication model. One of these concerns the choice of the error control <ref> [4] </ref> mechanism. Much of the earlier work on error-control for mul-tipoint communication has focussed on designing protocols in the context of communication over broadcast channels [2, 12, 14, 16].

Reference-contexts: By examining the acknowledgements from each receiver, the sender identifies lost packets and schedules them for retransmission. If no packets are lost, then the transmission of 3 Out-of-sequence delivery of blocks is quite useful for certain categories of applications, such as image transfers <ref> [5] </ref>. a block is complete and the sender can send the next block. The same technique is used to force acknowl-edgements while retransmitting packets. When processing the acknowledgements for retransmitted packets the sender only checks the acks from receivers that did not receive the packet originally.

The protocol that we model uses a block based acknowledgement scheme, selective retransmissions and multicasts lost packets. The sender is assumed to know all the receivers and provide reliable delivery of data to all of them.

Reference-contexts: A third possibility, which is most often used [1, 3, 14], is to multicast the lost packet to the entire group of receivers. This is the simplest strategy and will perform best if more than a certain number of receivers do not receive a packet <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.1 Protocol description The protocol that we have chosen to study reflects the observations made above. We next describe a generic protocol which will be used as a platform for the analysis in the rest of the paper.

Reference-contexts: The communication is assumed to proceed via a high-speed wide area packet switched network. We assume that the network layer protocols provide multicast support (as in IP Multicast <ref> [8] </ref>) by constructing a multicast tree for routing. We assume that errors due to transmission or switching errors are very rare and that the main cause of data loss is buffer overflow at the routers or hosts.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of retransmission a selective retransmission strategy seems appropriate. Although a go-back-n mechanism requires very simple functionality on the part of receivers, namely no packet resequencing ability, it wastes bandwidth and increases the total transfer time in a WAN environment <ref> [17] </ref>. For multicast sessions a packet lost at a router may not be received by a subset of receivers. Hence the packet has to to be retransmitted to these receivers.
