Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The driving force behind the spectacular advancement of the integrated circuit technology in the past thirty years has been the exponential scaling of the feature size, i.e., the minimum dimension of a transistor. It has been following the Moores Law <ref> [1] </ref> at the rate of a factor of 0.7 reduction every three years. It is expected that such exponential scaling will continue for at least another 10-12 years as projected in the recently published 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS97) [2] shown in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: It has been following the Moores Law [1] at the rate of a factor of 0.7 reduction every three years. It is expected that such exponential scaling will continue for at least another 10-12 years as projected in the recently published 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS97) <ref> [2] </ref> shown in Table 1. This will lead to over half a billion transistors integrated on a single chip with an operating frequency of 2-3 GHz in the 70nm technology by Year 2009. <p> Overall technology roadmap from NTRS97 <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Challenges in NTRS Implementation The rapid scaling of IC technology has two profound impacts. First, it leads to much smaller and faster devices, but more resistive interconnects with larger coupling capacitance. This results in interconnect limited designs. <p> It is predicted that the electromigration current density limitation of Cu will become an issue at the 70nm technology <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> For example, in the 70nm technology, with over 500 million transistors and 10 kilometer metal wires integrated in a single chip operating at multi-gigahertz, the overall power consumption is estimated to be 170W for high-performance microprocessors <ref> [2] </ref> even after drastic power supply scaling.

Reference-contexts: significance of interconnects in future technology generations, we collected basic interconnect parameters provided in NTRS97 (shown in boldface in Table 2), and set up a proper 3D interconnect model to extract various components of interconnect capacitance (shown in the remaining rows in Table 2) using the 3D field solver FastCap <ref> [3] </ref>. We also collected the basic device parameters provided in NTRS97 (shown in boldface in Table 3) and derived the driver/buffer input capacitance, effective resistance, and intrinsic delay in each technology generation (shown in the remaining rows in Table 3) using HSPICE simulation.

Reference-contexts: Recent advances on interconnect optimization techniques, such as interconnect topology optimization, optimal buffer insertion and sizing, optimal wiresizing, etc, can help to reduce interconnect delays significantly (see <ref> [4] </ref> for details). But they are not able to reverse the trend of growing gap between device and interconnect performance.

Reference-contexts: Intrinsic gate delays 1 and delay values for an average interconnect (1mm), a global interconnect (2cm) 2 (both with 2x minimum width and 2x minimum spacing), and a 2cm optimized global interconnect after simultaneous driver sizing, buffer insertion, buffer sizing, and wire sizing, using the TRIO package developed at UCLA <ref> [5] </ref> in different technology generations 3 . <p> Table 6 shows the optimization results of a 2cm global interconnect in each technology generation obtained using simultaneous driver sizing, buffer insertion, buffer sizing, and wire sizing using the TRIO package <ref> [5] </ref>. For the 70nm technology, an optimized 2cm global interconnect contains 8 buffers (16 inverters), with over 99% wire segments being sized using 10 different wire widths (within the same 2cm line!). Clearly, a global interconnect is no longer a simple metal line. <p> Complexity of interconnects in each technology generation as projected in NTRS97.

The maximum wire width is limited to 10x the minimum and the maximum buffer size is limited to 200x the minimum. A long wire is divided into a sequence of unit-length segments, each of 100um.

Reference-contexts: Design and optimization of process geometry and interconnect physical architecture may substantially improve the interconnect performance by optimally determining the width, spacing, wire and via aspect ratio, metal and dielectric materials of each layer to be used in fabrication. An aggressive reverse scaling scheme was suggested in <ref> [7] </ref>, where an exponentially increasing reverse scaling factor is applied to all conductor and dielectric cross sectional dimensions when each pair of wiring layers are added. This scheme effectively controls the growth of global interconnect delay at the expense of design density.
