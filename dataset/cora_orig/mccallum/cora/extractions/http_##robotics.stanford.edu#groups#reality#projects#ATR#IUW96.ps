Abstract: Trihedrals give rise to point scatterers that are important features in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Shadows and extended features are analyzed in terms of point scatterers. Images of point scatterers are delta function peaks that are imaged as Gaussian peaks with the SAR impulse response function. Complex features and clusters in digital images may contain peaks and valleys at different scales. This paper describes two new peak detection algorithms for Gaussian peaks. The statistical performances of two new peak detection operators are analyzed theoretically. Analytic results are compared with truth in synthesized images with Gaussian peaks and truth in SAR images. The two operators estimate accurately the peak position, peak amplitude and peak width in both of synthesized and SAR images. Experimental results obtained by applying these two peak detectors are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Point scatterers are important because of the physical properties of SAR imaging. (see Figure A5 in Appendix and <ref> [1] </ref>) Peak detection is a first step for feature and cluster analysis in digital images. The accuracy of peak detection dominates the correct analysis of features and clusters. For example, target dimensions may be obtained by ratios among distances between peaks in target scattering signal.
