Abstract: When multiple systems are interconnected through a high-speed backbone network and communicate without resource reservation, under certain conditions a severe overload can appear at the destination system. This problem, called the converging flows problem, can be alleviated by use of a feedback control mechanism that coordinates the emission of the sources. In this paper we present a dynamic resource management mechanism that both controls the losses at the congested node and attempts to optimize resource utilization. In fact it steers the entire system into a desirable operating regime. We study analytically the behavior of the system under such a control and we show that it can be reduced with a few approximations to a well-known physical system. This allows us to infer optimal values for the parameters of the command algorithm, and we show that these values have a natural physical meaning to the system.

Reference-contexts: If the ATM network provides no connectionless service but only dedicated virtual circuits, the communicating entities are the interworking units at the edge of the network. On the other hand if the network provides direct connectionless service as described in <ref> [1] </ref>, then the communicating entities are the connection-less servers distributed over the ATM network. In both cases the transmission rate of the high-speed network is larger than the processing capabilities of the interconnected entities. <p> sources, our mechanism can achieve a tighter control on the system. 3.2 Resource evaluation A good choice for the resource evaluation function fi, when the departure rate d 0 (t) is constant, is a linear function: fi (t) = h (r e 0 (t)) + d 0 ; r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> In this equation, r is a fixed value that represents a desirable occupancy ratio for the destination buffer. The parameter h influences the responsiveness of the algorithm and has the dimension of a flow rate.

Reference-contexts: This can lead to a severe overload situation in the system.

The problem of converging flows represents a serious threat to the proper operation of the whole system.

Reference-contexts: With such a control, the destination gives permission to one of the sources to emit and requires the others to wait until the next control command. The decision of which one is allowed to transmit is based for example on the sources queue lengths <ref> [5] </ref>. This mechanism is useful as long as the network remains relatively small, but with propagation delays of tens of milliseconds, undesirable oscillations appear and the performance of such a mechanism drops off [6, 7]. Novel congestion management mechanisms which both reduce resource waste and avoid oscillations are needed.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism is useful as long as the network remains relatively small, but with propagation delays of tens of milliseconds, undesirable oscillations appear and the performance of such a mechanism drops off [6, 7]. Novel congestion management mechanisms which both reduce resource waste and avoid oscillations are needed. In <ref> [8] </ref> we have proposed a feedback control mechanism that overcomes the problems mentioned above. It is based on a command algorithm running at the destination entity which continually collects state information sent by the emitting entities, evaluates the resource need of each source and distributes the estimated available resources accordingly. <p> The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we describe the interconnection model that is studied and in section 3 we summarize the main results that were obtained in <ref> [8] </ref>. In section 4 we develop the analytical study of the resource distribution policy of the feedback algorithm, and in section 5 we study the resource evaluation policy. <p> The problem of designing a command algorithm that approaches the goal defined above was first studied in <ref> [8] </ref> and we summarize, in the following section, the main results that were obtained. 3 The command algorithm The command algorithm is naturally divided into two independent phases. In a first phase, the amount of bandwidth available at time t, say fi (t), is estimated.

Reference-contexts: This is typically what happens in an overlay network of connectionless servers on top of an ATM network <ref> [9] </ref>. It would also be interesting to examine the opportunities of cooperation with other resource management mechanisms that are used inside of an ATM network at the virtual circuit level.
