Abstract: In this paper we present an attack upon the Needham-Schroeder public-key authentication protocol. The attack allows an intruder to impersonate another agent.

Reference-contexts: This correction represents an instance of Principle 3 of <ref> [AN94] </ref>: If the identity of a principal is essential to the meaning of a message, it is prudent to mention the principal's name explicitly in the message. We conjecture that the revised protocol is safe against all attacks|at least, those attacks not dependent upon properties of the encryption method used.

Reference-contexts: Hence B believes that A has correctly established a session with it. 3 We should consider the consequences of this attack. It has been sug-gested <ref> [NS78, BAN89] </ref> that because the nonces are shared secrets, they can be included within subsequent messages as authentication. However, after the above attack, the intruder knows the nonces, and so he may continue to impersonate A to send messages to B during the session.

Reference-contexts: However, we show that it fails to ensure authentication: we show that an intruder can impersonate an agent A during a run of the protocol, to trick another agent B into thinking that he really is talking to A. The protocol uses public key cryptography <ref> [DH76, RSA78] </ref>. Each agent A possesses a public key, denoted K a , which any other agent can obtain from a key server. It also possesses a secret key, K 1 a , which is the inverse of K a .

Reference-contexts: This protocol can be considered as the interleaving of two logically disjoint protocols: messages 1, 2, 4 and 5 are concerned with obtaining public keys, whereas messages 3, 6 and 7 are concerned with the authentication of A and B. Denning and Sacco <ref> [DS81] </ref> have pointed out that this protocol provides no guarantee that the public keys obtained are current, rather than replays of old, possibly compromised keys. This problem can be overcome in various ways, for example by including timestamps in the key deliveries.

Reference-contexts: This is the role of an authentication protocol. In this paper we consider the Needham-Schroeder public-key authentication protocol <ref> [NS78] </ref>. The protocol aims to provide mutual authentication, after which some session involving the exchange of messages can take place. <p> Hence B believes that A has correctly established a session with it. 3 We should consider the consequences of this attack. It has been sug-gested <ref> [NS78, BAN89] </ref> that because the nonces are shared secrets, they can be included within subsequent messages as authentication. However, after the above attack, the intruder knows the nonces, and so he may continue to impersonate A to send messages to B during the session.
