Abstract: Consider the problem in which impatient customers have to be routed to or scheduled from a set of parallel homogeneous service stations with finite buffer capacities. When the service times and the deadlines of customers are exponentially distributed, we identify the control policies that stochastically minimize the total number of losses by any time t. We study systems with deadlines to the beginning or to the end of service. The results regarding the individual types of losses, i.e., losses due to deadline misses and losses due to buffer overflow, vary across different systems. In all cases we state explicitly the properties and the limitations of the optimal control policies.

Reference-contexts: The problem of scheduling customers with known deadlines has been extensively treated in the context of single queues or tandem queueing systems (see Bhattacharya and Ephremides <ref> [1] </ref>, Panwar et al. [9], Towsley and Baccelli [16]). The results are applicable to real time computer systems and packet-switched networks carrying voice or video packets with real-time constraints.

Reference-contexts: To date, there has been almost no work done on the problem of dynamic control of impatient customers in a set of parallel queues. A tentative step in this direction was made by Bhattach-arya and Ephremides <ref> [2] </ref> in the context of a multiclass discrete-time scheduling system with two queues. In this paper we study routing and scheduling systems with finite capacities and customers with identical exponential deadlines.

Reference-contexts: However, the latter incurs smaller holding costs since only one queue (vs. all K queues for the former vector) will almost be at capacity at any time. In fact, it was shown by Chang <ref> [3] </ref> that the routing vector (1=K; :::; 1=K) minimizes losses due to overflow by any time t. In the presence of deadlines, a similar result can be proven using arguments similar to those in Theorem 5.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, in the case of routing systems with exponential servers it has been shown that the optimal policy is the one that always routes customers to the Shortest Queue (SQ) (see Ephremides et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, Hordijk and Koole [5], Johri [6], Sparaggis et al. [11], Towsley et al. [14], Weber [18], Winston [20]). However, when service times are not exponential it was shown by Whitt [19] that it is not always optimal to join the shortest queue.

Reference-contexts: When arrival streams are interchangable and the server is exponential Towsley et al. [15] show that the policy which always schedules the server to the Longest Queue (LQ) stochastically minimizes losses by any time t. A combined SQ/LQ policy was shown by Menich and Serfozo <ref> [8] </ref> to maximize throughput in a combined routing/scheduling system with state-dependent service rates. In this paper we look at these systems from a different perspective. Specifically, we assume that customers have deadlines associated with them; when deadlines expire, customers leave the system and are considered to be lost. <p> Here deadlines are assumed to be independent of arrival and service times. Let SQ/LQ be the policy that always routes incoming customers to the shortest queue and schedules the movable server to the longest queue. This policy was shown by Menich and Serfozo <ref> [8] </ref> to stochastically minimize holding costs (i.e., queue lengths) in a similar system with infinite capacities and no deadlines. In the presence of finite capacities and deadlines this result is no longer true, since there exist tradeoffs between minimizing queue lengths and minimizing losses.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, in the case of routing systems with exponential servers it has been shown that the optimal policy is the one that always routes customers to the Shortest Queue (SQ) (see Ephremides et al. [4], Hordijk and Koole [5], Johri [6], Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>, Towsley et al. [14], Weber [18], Winston [20]). However, when service times are not exponential it was shown by Whitt [19] that it is not always optimal to join the shortest queue. On the other hand, little work has been done on scheduling systems. <p> In some cases our arguments employ the use of the weak sub/supermajorization and exploit some results used by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> for routing systems with state-dependent service rates. In other cases, however, these forms of majorization become too strong to apply because of the existence of an interesting trade-off between the objective of minimizing losses and the way the state dynamics evolve. <p> The former type has been commonly used in establishing the optimality of certain control policies in systems with infinite buffer space (e.g., Menich and Serfozo [8],Walrand [17]) and occasionally in systems with finite buffer space (e.g., Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>, Towsley et al. [14, 15]). The latter was introduced by Sparaggis et al. [12] to analyze some certain types of 3 systems with finite capacity and/or multiple classes of customers, for which weak majorization is too strong to apply. <p> For a 2 IR let a + = max (a; 0). Some of the properties of weak majorization for vectors with integer elements are summarized in the following two lemmas; the proofs can be found in Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Theorem 1 L d (t) st L fL SQ ov (t); t 0g; (6) 1 for all 2 0 , provided that N SQ (0) = st N (0). Proof. For the most part this is an application of Theorem 1 obtained by Sparaggis et al <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> ~ L SQ ov (t); (8) a.s., where all the quantities above are defined on a common probability space and are stochastically equal to the similarly defined quantities in the original system (e.g., ~ L SQ ov (t) = st L SQ The construction is described by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> and was applied to the same routing system in which there were no deadlines associated with customers and the service rates were considered to be increasing and concave with respect to queue lengths. <p> Since r (n) is increasing and concave in n, (8) and (9) follow as in Theorem 1 of Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. 7 Relation (5) can be proven by conditioning on event times as follows. Assume that (5) holds at the completion of the nth event, say at time t n . <p> the interval (0; P K ~ N i (t n )] and, for = SQ; , we schedule the deadline miss to take place under if t n i=1 Service completions are scheduled in any way that is consistent with the underlying statistical assumptions (e.g., as in Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>). If the (n + 1)th event is not a deadline miss, then, clearly, ~ L SQ d (t n+1 ), which implies (5) at t n+1 . <p> Then at time t + a deadline miss will occur under a.s., leading to ~ N SQ (t + ) = (1; 1) 6 w (1; 0) = ~ N (t + ). In fact, it was shown by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> that when service rates are increasing convex w.r.t. the queue lengths and there are no deadlines, then SQ is the worst policy, and the Longest Queue policy provides the best performance. <p> For deadline misses the construction is the same as in Theorem 3 by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> where service times with increasing and convex rates (w.r.t. the queue lenghts) were considered. Relations (25) and (26) hold trivially at t = 0. <p> If the next event is a deadline miss then (26) holds at t n+1 since weak supermajorization propagates along sample paths when service times are increasing linear functions of the queue lengths (Theorem 3 by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [11] </ref>), and we can, of course, treat deadline misses as 13 service completions.

Reference-contexts: This results in a trade-off which we quantify by making use of a generalized form of weak majorization, namely, the p-weak majorization, that has been very recently introduced by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. This form enables us to distinguish among different systems and state explicitly the properties and the limitations of the optimal policies. In all cases, however, we are able to establish a policy that stochastically minimizes the overall number of losses by any time t. <p> The latter was introduced by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [12] </ref> to analyze some certain types of 3 systems with finite capacity and/or multiple classes of customers, for which weak majorization is too strong to apply. Let N; M 2 IN K , IN = f0; 1; 2; :::g, be two arbitrary K-dimensional vectors with non-negative integer elements. <p> M w ( ^ N 1 ; : : : ; ( ^ N n 1) + ; : : : ; ^ N K ). The following generalized form of weak majorization was recently introduced by Sparaggis et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> Proof. The proof of parts 1-4 is very similar to that of Lemmas 1, 2 and the details can be found in Sparaggis et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. We now prove part 5. If p = 0 the proof follows trivially. Consider now the case p &gt; 0. Let n fl = minfi n : ^ N i = ^ N n g.
