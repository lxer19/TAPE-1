Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new decomposition called the pivoted QLP decomposition. It is computed by applying pivoted orthogonal triangulariza-tion to the columns of the matrix X in question to get an upper triangular factor R and then applying the same procedure to the rows of R to get a lower triangular matrix L. The diagonal elements of R are called the R-values of X; those of L are called the L-values. Numerical examples show that the L-values track the singular values of X with considerable fidelity | far better than the R-values. At a gap in the L-values the decomposition provides orthonormal bases of analogues of row, column, and null spaces provided of X. The decomposition requires no more than twice the work required for a pivoted QR decomposition. The computation of R and L can be interleaved, so that the computation can be terminated at any suitable point, which makes the decomposition especially suitable for low-rank determination problems. The interleaved algorithm also suggests a new, efficient 2-norm estimator. fl This report is an extensive revision and expansion of TR-97-31, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland.

Reference-contexts: As n increases, the additional work becomes negligible. It should be pointed out that when n is much greater than p the work required for calculation of the singular value decomposition of R (and hence that of X) is also negligible (e.g., see <ref> [1] </ref>). However, an important aspect of the QLP decomposition | one not shared with the singular value decomposition | is that by interleaving the computation of R and L we can terminate the algorithm as soon as it has proceeded far enough for the purposes at hand.

Reference-contexts: As c departs from zero, however, there is an increasingly great gap between the next-to-last and last singular values, while the ratio of the corresponding R-values remains near one.
