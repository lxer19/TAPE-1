Abstract: Images which do not have proper synchronization, such as decompressed raw video, must be synchronized before being displayed. This paper describes the design of a parameterizable custom integrated circuit that generates both horizontal and vertical synchronization and blanking intervals as defined by video standards (such as NTSC and PAL). An instance has been generated for use in a 640x480 video system and placed on a chip using Lager, a silicon compiler. Estimates indicate the 1.5 volt module will consume 0.2mW, a factor of 10 reduction in power as compared to an equivalent solution operating at Figure 1, An Example System, on page 2, shows a sample video compression/decompression system. Data compression is utilized to reduce transmission and storage requirements. During compression, the image timing information is lost, and thus the receiver not only must decompress but must also time the image data before it can be displayed. Video uses both horizontal and vertical synchronization to maintain image integrity. This paper discusses a timing module, implemented as a custom integrated circuit, which generates the sync signals for the NTSC 525 video standard. The design is completely parameterizable which aims to reduce the effort required to adapt it for other display standards and resolutions. In the sample system it performs the re-timing of the decompressed data.
