Abstract: In multi-access wireless systems, dynamic allocation of resources such as transmit power, bandwidths and rates is an important means to deal with the time-varying nature of the environment. In this two-part paper, we consider the problem of optimal resource allocation from an information theoretic point of view. We focus on the multi-access fading channel with Gaussian noise, and define two notions of capacity depending on whether the traffic is delay-sensitive or not. In part I, we have analyzed the throughput capacity region which characterizes the long-term achievable rates through the time-varying channel. However, the delay experienced depends on how fast the channel varies. In the present paper, part II, we introduce a notion of delay-limited capacity which is the maximum rate achievable with delay independent of how slow the fading is. We characterize the delay-limited capacity region of the multi-access fading channel and the associated optimal resource allocation schemes. We show that successive decoding is optimal, and the optimal decoding order and power allocation can be found explicitly as a function of the fading states; this is a consequence of an underlying polymatroid structure that we exploit.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it can be shown that by applying the algorithm recursively to balance the power requirements of users in the subsets L 1 ; : : : L k defined above, one can in fact compute a min-max fair solution (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a corresponding algorithm for bandwidth allocation.) 5 Auxiliary Constraints on Transmit Power The constraints on the transmit powers we considered so far are on their long-term average value, and under power control, the transmit power will vary depending on the fading state.

Reference-contexts: The problem is that the channel is spending a lot of time close to zero. One approach to deal with this is to allow an event of outage when the channel gets too weak. (This is the approach taken by Ozarow et al [12] and Cheng <ref> [3] </ref> for situations where there is no power control.) Thus, even for these fading distributions, it is meaningful to consider the notion of delay-limited capacity during the times when the channel is reasonable, and declare an outage otherwise.

Reference-contexts: But first, let us look at some special cases of Theorem 3.3. 3.2 Examples 1)Single-User Channel: When M = 1, the delay-limited capacity C d ( P ) is given by: C d ( P ) = 2 P 0 h dh The corresponding power control strategy inverts the channel <ref> [8] </ref>. We note that for some fading distributions, the delay-limited capacity may be zero. For example, for Rayleigh fading, f (h) = a h ) R 1 f (h) h dh = 1, so C d = 0.

Reference-contexts: The formal notion of delay limited capacity for multi-access channels was defined in Hanly and Tse <ref> [10] </ref>, where we considered the symmetric case with users having the same rate requirements. In the present paper, we focus on characterizing the entire delay-limited capacity region and the associated optimal power control schemes. As in Part I, we shall exploit the convex and polymatroid structure of this problem. <p> Finally, in Section 7, we explore the implications of these information theoretic results to systems with sub-optimal coding and decoding. In Hanly and Tse <ref> [10] </ref>, the concept of delay limited capacity is extended to take advantage of statistical multiplexing: it is not always necessary for power control to be used to ensure that "sufficient mutual information is available at every time instant"; this can also be a property of the averaging of the independent fading <p> The notion of delay-limited capacity for multi-access fading channels was first introduced in <ref> [10] </ref>. In Definition 2.2, we only require that there be a codebook for every realization of every fading process. However, the proof of Theorem 2.3 below shows that we can provide a single codebook of unit power that we scale by the power control policy identified in the theorem. <p> This issue is investigated further in subsequent work by Caire et. al. [2]. For many other distributions, such as the log-normal distribution for shadow fading, a non-zero delay-limited capacity is obtained even without the need of allowing outage. 2)Symmetrical Case <ref> [10] </ref>: Consider the case when there are M users, the fading of users are identical and independent, and their power constraints are the same.

Reference-contexts: Due to the auxiliary constraints, the optimal solution is not necessarily on a vertex of the capacity region. However, Rimoldi and Urbanke <ref> [13] </ref> show that each user can be split into at most 21 2 "virtual users", such that the resulting point can be achieved by successive decoding of at most 2M virtual users.

Reference-contexts: The scheduling rule here depends on both the power prices and the current fading state. In fact, this rule is analogous to the classic c rule in scheduling theory (see eg. <ref> [14] </ref>), as both arise from the polymatroid structure of the problem. The additional feature in our problem is that the scheduling priority is a dynamic function of the fading state.
