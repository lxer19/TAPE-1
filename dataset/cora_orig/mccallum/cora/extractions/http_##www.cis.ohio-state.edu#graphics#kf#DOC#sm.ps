Abstract: An image warping method is presented that deforms an image continuously without foldover, while observing a given set of trajectories of feature elements. Any intermediate image during the morph is homeomorphic to the initial image and the morphing process is a homotopy. The method permits points, line-segments, and polygons to be included as features in the image. Techniques are described to make the deformation process smooth in spatial as well as temporal dimensions. An experimental result is included to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and complexity of the algorithm is analyzed. Morphing between images that are topoplogically unequivalent is also briefly discussed.

Reference-contexts: The lengths of the line features may change as well as the angles between them. We assume that the features that are originally disjoint remain disjoint at all times and that all features are contained inside of a certain polygonally-bounded region D. For x 2 D and t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a morph function F : (D; t) ! D is to be constructed that satisfies: * F (p i ; t) = s i (t) for t in [0,1]. * F (x; t) is a homeomorphism from D to D for any t in [0,1]. * F (x; t) <p> Their approach, which is based on line features as opposed to point features, is claimed to provide more intuitive control for human users. This approach has lately been extended to 3D [17]. At times, scattered data interpolation methods such as multiquadrics are used for image warping <ref> [1, 24] </ref>. The simplest method for scattered data interpolation would be to use triangulation for a given set of feature points. Using piecewise linear or cubic functions for interpolating triangular patches has been proposed for image registration [12]. <p> Image warping may be considered as a function F (x; t), where x 2 D (D is a region in 2D) and t &gt; 0 is time (F (x; 0) is the initial image). Most image warping algorithms (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 13, 24] </ref>) take F (x; 0) and feature locations in the target image (at time, say, t 1 ) and produces F (x; t 1 ) (i.e., the target image) as output. To generate intermediate images, the same procedure is repeatedly applied by using intermediate feature locations. <p> Our method can not achieve such a duplica tion. Additional remarks include the following. In our method, points, lines, and polygons can all be used as fea tures. Some methods (e.g., ones using scattered data interpolation <ref> [1, 24] </ref>) only permit point features, whereas only line features are used in the feature-based metamorphosis method [4]. In our method, features are not permitted to intersect with each other. This requires some care when generating their trajectories. 5.3.

Reference-contexts: The second condition requires that the image is deformed without foldover and the third condition requires that no point in the picture jumps abruptly from one location to another during the morph sequence. Thus, the morph process is modeled by a homotopy <ref> [2] </ref> with an added condition that all intermediate images are homeomorphic to each other. Intuitively, the above conditions ensure a continuous foldover-free deformation, while satisfying the given trajectories.

Reference-contexts: Broadly speaking, they can be categorized into two classes, image-based methods and object-based methods. In earlier image-based morphing methods, point features organized in a rectilinear fashion [33] are used to define correspondence between two images. Beier and Nealy <ref> [4] </ref> propose a feature-based method which does not have this constraint. Their approach, which is based on line features as opposed to point features, is claimed to provide more intuitive control for human users. This approach has lately been extended to 3D [17]. <p> However, these approaches can be problematic since intermediate shapes are at times significantly distorted or self-intersecting. Physically-based approaches or edge-angle interpolation [28] usually generate results of better quality. The problem is also considered by interpolating the transformation matrix [30, 34]. A similar approach is taken by Beier and Nealy <ref> [4] </ref> to define the orientations and locations of line features for intermediate images. Despite various efforts, a general method is yet to be investigated that always generates intersection-free and yet visually convincing intermediate shapes. Sederberg and Parry [27] have introduced a free-form deformation method based on the trivariate Bernstein basis. <p> Image warping may be considered as a function F (x; t), where x 2 D (D is a region in 2D) and t &gt; 0 is time (F (x; 0) is the initial image). Most image warping algorithms (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 13, 24] </ref>) take F (x; 0) and feature locations in the target image (at time, say, t 1 ) and produces F (x; t 1 ) (i.e., the target image) as output. To generate intermediate images, the same procedure is repeatedly applied by using intermediate feature locations. <p> Let us consider how image point P in Fig. 10a (which is initially outside of the quadrilateral) is moved by using the image metemorphosis technique <ref> [4] </ref>. Point P is mapped to P 1 and P 2 by means of features DA and CD, respectively and it remains at P by means of features AB and BC. <p> Additional remarks include the following. In our method, points, lines, and polygons can all be used as fea tures. Some methods (e.g., ones using scattered data interpolation [1, 24]) only permit point features, whereas only line features are used in the feature-based metamorphosis method <ref> [4] </ref>. In our method, features are not permitted to intersect with each other. This requires some care when generating their trajectories. 5.3. Extensions Feature merging We have so far discussed the case that features are not permitted to intersect at all.

Reference-contexts: This choice has an advantage over other triangulations in that Delaunay triangulation tends to avoid flat triangles (it maximizes the smallest angle over all triangulations <ref> [21] </ref>). The Mandrill image is morphed by using the sequence of feature trajectories given in Fig. 8. See our color plate for a foldover-free warping. When making a morph sequence, intermediate images are usually created with a regular time interval, say, t. <p> For simplicity, we assume feature trajectories are linear for this analysis. An initial triangulation can be created in O (n log n) time by using a divide-and-conquer method <ref> [21] </ref>. It takes O (log n) time to find the next event [23]. On an event, updates on the data structure take O (1) time and it takes O (log n) to update the queue.

For example, in the example of Fig. 3, the black dot can go around the white dot an arbitrary number of times. For some special cases, k can be bounded by a function of n. For example, Roos <ref> [23] </ref> has observed that Delaunay triangulation for a set of n points translating linearly changes its structure O (n n) times in the average case. 5.2.

Reference-contexts: Flexible templates are also used for image matching. Jain et al [15] use a parametric deformation method for pattern matching in image databases. Template deformation is used to match a model against a 3D data [20] and 2D images [7]. Physically-based deformation has also been proposed <ref> [32] </ref>. Bookstein [5] uses point correspondence in an irregular spacing for deformation using the thin plate spline. Object-based methods, which deform an object defined by polygonal arcs into another, consist of two parts, that is, the vertex correspondence problem and the interpolation problem.

Reference-contexts: Prior Work A number of image and shape morphing methods have been proposed in the past several years. Broadly speaking, they can be categorized into two classes, image-based methods and object-based methods. In earlier image-based morphing methods, point features organized in a rectilinear fashion <ref> [33] </ref> are used to define correspondence between two images. Beier and Nealy [4] propose a feature-based method which does not have this constraint. Their approach, which is based on line features as opposed to point features, is claimed to provide more intuitive control for human users.

Reference-contexts: Shinagawa and Kunii [29] use a homotopy model for surface reconstruction between two contours. Other approaches for lofting include [8, 19]. Sederberg and Greenwood [26] propose a method in which a physically-based cost is associated with each edge of the toroidal graph. Zhang <ref> [34] </ref> also addresses the vertex correspondence problem by considering a similarity measure between two polygons to be morphed. For the interpolation problem to determine intermediate shapes, linear and Hermite interpolations are widely used. However, these approaches can be problematic since intermediate shapes are at times significantly distorted or self-intersecting. <p> However, these approaches can be problematic since intermediate shapes are at times significantly distorted or self-intersecting. Physically-based approaches or edge-angle interpolation [28] usually generate results of better quality. The problem is also considered by interpolating the transformation matrix <ref> [30, 34] </ref>. A similar approach is taken by Beier and Nealy [4] to define the orientations and locations of line features for intermediate images. Despite various efforts, a general method is yet to be investigated that always generates intersection-free and yet visually convincing intermediate shapes.
