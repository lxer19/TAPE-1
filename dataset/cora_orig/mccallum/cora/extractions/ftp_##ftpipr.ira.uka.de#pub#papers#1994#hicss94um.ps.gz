Abstract: In this paper the integrated D i SCUS environment (Distributed Simulation and Control in a Unix Sys tem) is presented, which is used for the simulation and the control of a small assembly cell. All (phys ical and logical) components are represented as stand alone programs, as tasks. These tasks are distributed over a workstation network, so that "true" parallelism can be achieved.
