Abstract: There has been much interest in using optics to implement computer interconnection networks. However, there has been little discussion of any routing methodologies besides those already used in electronics. In this paper, a neural network routing methodology is proposed that can generate control bits for an optical multistage interconnection network (OMIN). Though we present no optical implementation of this methodology, we illustrate its control for an optical interconnection network. These OMINs may be used as communication media for shared memory, distributed computing systems. The routing methodology makes use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that functions as a parallel computer for generating the routes. The neural network routing scheme may be applied to electrical as well as optical interconnection networks. However, since the ANN can be implemented using optics, this routing approach is especially appealing for an optical computing environment. The parallel nature of the ANN computation may make this routing scheme faster than conventional routing approaches, especially for OMINs that are irregular. Furthermore, the neural network routing scheme is fault-tolerant. Results are shown for generating routes in a 16 fi 16, 3 stage OMIN.

Reference-contexts: The logic block Logic2 is required to convert the routing array solution of the neural network into a crosspoint form that the interconnection network can understand. The construction of these logic blocks should be a straightforward process. Further information on interconnection networks may be found in <ref> [1, 16] </ref>. There has already been some interesting work done on utilizing Hopfield model neural networks to facilitate communication through interconnection networks. <p> The OMIN has 12 of these switches. Each crossbar switch in the OMIN is connected to each crossbar switch in the neighboring stages. This MIN is capable of routing any input/output permutation. Its construction is similar to that of the standard Benes network <ref> [1, 26] </ref>, although the Benes network's basic building block is a 2 fi 2 crossbar switch. However, the OMIN has the same type of recursive structure that the standard Benes network has. The 3-dimensional routing problem will now be reduced to a 2-dimensional routing problem.

Reference-contexts: The very same methodology, however, can be applied to a 3-dimensional OMIN problem by collapsing the 3-dimensional problem down to a 2-dimensional problem.

The neural network router in Figure 1 has two logic blocks to interface the neural network with the rest of the communication system.

Reference-contexts: So for each message cycle there is a set of desired messages. The problem is to generate control bits for the MIN given the message set. The neural network router is discussed in <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. In these references the neural network router was applied to an EMIN routing problem.

This representation will be called the routing array. It was first presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, and it is the representation that is used by the ANN. In Section 4, the appropriate ANN structure will be described. <p> It was shown how the 3-dimensional OMIN can be reduced to a 2-dimensional MIN, making the neural network routing solution described in <ref> [8] </ref> possible. This routing method is valid for a wide range of OMINs that have a certain structure. It was shown that the routing method is fault-tolerant. Once the OMIN is chosen, the routing neural network can be constructed and the 13 weights never have to change.

If the circuit implementation of the ANN from <ref> [15] </ref> is utilized, changing to a new set of desired messages corresponds to reducing the input bias currents to illegal nodes in the first and last stages of the ANN. The connectivity matrix is defined totally by the MIN that is chosen, and so the conductances need not change.
