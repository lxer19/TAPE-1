Title: A New Structure From Motion Ambiguity

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a new approximate ambiguity in structure from motion which occurs as generically as the bas-relief ambiguity but applies more strongly to scenes with larger depth variation. It occurs for moderate translations and field of view (as for the bas-relief ambiguity) and applies to multi-frame, finite-motion sequences where the camera moves roughly along a line, as well as to optical flow. Previous work on the bas-relief ambiguity gave a partial characterization of the error sensitivities in recovering the camera heading, assuming that the scene was non-planar and that the heading was sufficiently different from the view direction. Our analysis completes the understanding of the error sensitivities under these conditions.

Figure 16 shows the result for two frames of a sequence of 22 tracked points <ref> [2] </ref>. After rotating so that T y = 0 and the images were centered, T = T scene was roughly planar with a (tilt) slant of (75 ffi ) 80 ffi , and the 3D points deviated from the plane on average by 0:9.

Reference-contexts: Note that our analysis of SFM in the ^ T-^z plane applies to planar as well as non-planar scenes: the flipped minimum still exists for planes. But, as is well known <ref> [8] </ref>, planar scenes have an extra two-fold ambiguity, and it is no longer true that (2) or the reprojection error are large everywhere away from the ^ T-^z plane.

Reference-contexts: This, together with our argument that we can assume that the true rotations are zero, implies that (2) approximates the coplanarity error for T 0 within the T-^z plane. For T 0 outside this plane, the bas-relief effect no longer applies <ref> [9] </ref> [8][6], i.e., rotations and translations are no longer easily confusable. Thus no rotation whether infinitesimal or finite will reduce the coplanarity error significantly beyond that computed for the true zero rotation, and again (2) gives a good approximation to the exact coplanarity error.

Reference-contexts: Our paper complements this previous work. Under the same assumptions, it combines to give a complete understanding of the ambiguities in SFM and has important implications for algorithms. In a companion paper <ref> [10] </ref>, we show how an algorithm can exploit our analysis to robustly recover the heading from a multi-image sequence. We consider the standard SFM problem of reconstructing the camera's direction of motion, either from a multi-image sequence of tracked points, from two frames, or from optical flow. <p> there all noise is in the flow. [4][1] derived the optical-flow error in a form similar to (2), but the advantage of (2) is that it is computable in o (N p N f ) steps and leads to a fast, efficient algorithm for recovering the heading from multiple frames <ref> [10] </ref>. For finite motion, E gives a good approximation to the exact copla-narity/epipolar error, and minimizing it gives an almost unbiased estimate of the true ^ T. <p> Letting H R be the square root of P 3 ; with P 3 = H T R H R (H R can be defined precisely and computed as the product of Householder matrices), the error (2) can be written as trace R .

But a more sophisticated algorithm can easily evade these minima, by using the facts that they occur at high errors and near T 0 ~ ^z.

Reference-contexts: is that motion sequences determine the ^ T-^z plane more reliably than the position of ^ T within this plane, at least when the x-y projection of ^ T is not too small. [9][8][6] proved this for optical flow and small FOV, but it is also true more generally (e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>). But these analyses do not address the ambiguity of determining ^ T within the ^ T-^z plane. Such a study is the aim of this paper. Without loss of generality, assume from now on that the true ^ T is in the x-z plane.
