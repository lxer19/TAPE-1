Abstract: Improved Non-approximability Results for Minimum Abstract We provide new non-approximability results for the restrictions of the Min Vertex Cover problem to bounded-degree, sparse and dense graphs. We show that for a sufficiently large B, the recent 16/15 lower bound proved by Bellare et al. [5] extends with negligible loss to graphs with bounded degree B. Then, we consider sparse graphs with no dense components (i.e. everywhere sparse graphs), and we show a similar result but with a better trade-off between non-approximability and sparsity. Finally we observe that the Min Vertex Cover problem remains APX-complete when restricted to dense graph and thus recent techniques developed for several Max SNP problems restricted to "dense" instances introduced by Arora et al. [2] cannot be applied.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts with the fact that several other graph problems (such as the Max Cut problem) admit an approximation scheme when restricted to dense instances <ref> [2] </ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give some preliminary definitions and some previous results.

Reference-contexts: Such a relation is sometimes called the FGLSS reduction after the names of its discoverers. Using this new approach, in a short while, a lot of increasingly strong non-approximability results were given for several problems. The verifier developed by Arora et al. <ref> [3] </ref> yielded, for several constant-factor approximable problems (namely, all the Max SNP-hard problems [29]), a lower bound on their approximability. Lund and Yannakakis successively gave other explicit lower bounds on the approximability of the Min Node Coloring and the Min Set Cover problems.

Reference-contexts: On the one hand, there have been several improvements in the efficiency of verifiers and in the way of measuring such efficiency <ref> [6, 15, 7, 5, 20] </ref>. The last achievement in this direction, due to H-astad [20], has been a verifier for Sat implying that Max Clique is not n 1=2* -approximable for any * &gt; 0. <p> Improved reductions yielded several recent breakthrough in approximability theory. For example, making heavy use of Raz's Parallel Repetition Theorem [30], and tightening a previous reduction given by Lund and Yan-nakakis [26], Feige [13] has recently shown a tight approximation lower bound for Min Set Cover. Bellare et al. <ref> [5] </ref> use local reductions to prove hardness results for the weighted versions of Max Sat and Max Cut. <p> Their reduction is from Max 3-Sat and uses explicit construction of expander graphs [16]. Combining this reduction, the non-approximability results by Bellare et al. <ref> [5] </ref> and the best known explicit construction of expanders [25], one can show that Min Vertex Cover is not 1.00036-approximable on bounded degree graphs.

Bellare et al. [5] give a 1.0688 lower bound for the general Min Vertex Cover problem by using a different technique, namely, they reduce directly from the computation of a verifier using a somehow "complementary" version of the FLGSS reduction [14]. <p> We provide a new characterization of the graphs resulting from the reduction from PCP verifiers to Min Vertex Cover <ref> [5] </ref>, and we show that such graphs can be seen as the union of bipartite complete graphs. We then give a construction of a particular kind of expanders (denoted as switch-ers). <p> It is worth noting that the best current non-approximability result for Max 3-Sat is about 1.038 <ref> [5] </ref>, while we can prove the Min Vertex Cover problem to be hard to 1.068-approximate over bounded-degree graphs. <p> We have to use the hypothesis that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse (actually, that NP 6 P/poly) because we use a non-uniform reduction. We also note that the reduction appeared in <ref> [5] </ref> can be slightly modified in order to show that the Min Vertex Cover problem is APX-complete even when restricted to dense graphs, and in particular to graphs with large minimum degree (thus, the "dense" restriction does not admit approximation schemes). <p> In particular, the Min Vertex Cover problem is APX-complete even when restricted to bounded-degree graphs [29, 24]. In which follows, we summarize the main definitions from the theory of probabilistically checkable proofs and its connections with the Min Vertex Cover problem. Our exposition follows <ref> [5] </ref>. A verifier is an oracle probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine V . During its computation, V tosses random coins, reads its input and has oracle access to a string called proof. <p> The following theorem shows that the existence of efficient verifiers for any NP problem implies a non-approximability result for Min Vertex Cover. Theorem 5 (Non-approximability of Min Vertex Cover <ref> [14, 5] </ref>) Let us assume that NP FPCP c;s [log; f; q]. Then, for any * &gt; 0, it is NP-hard to (1 * + (c s)=(2 f c))-approximate the Min Vertex Cover problem. Sketch of the proof. <p> The best current non-approximability result for Min Vertex Cover is achieved by showing that NP FPCP 1;0:794 [log; 2; q] for a certain constant q <ref> [5] </ref>. This implies that it is NP-hard to 1.068-approximate Min Vertex Cover. 5 3 Switchers As described in the Introduction, our technical goal is to replace complete bipartite graphs with sparse bipartite graphs which preserve a sufficiently good "connectivity" property. <p> Moreover, opt (G ) + ffjV j 1 opt (G 0 ) opt (G ) + ffjV j : The results of <ref> [5] </ref> imply that a constant r &gt; 1 exists such that it is NP-hard to r-approximate Min Vertex Cover on graphs with minimum degree at least *n. <p> We computed the non-approximability result for Min Steiner Tree that arises from <ref> [29, 8, 25, 5] </ref>, and it is about 1 + 1=5600.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that the above described reduction from FGLSS graphs to dense graphs is approximation-preserving, and, in particular, is an L-reduction [29], and thus also an E-reduction [24] and an AP-reduction (see <ref> [9] </ref>). The APX-completeness of the Min Vertex Cover problem restricted to dense graphs follows. 2 Note that inserting a large clique provides a non-approximability result only because FGLSS graphs are such that the minimum vertex cover always has (n) nodes, which is not true in general.

Reference-contexts: In the general case, a very simple 2-approximate algorithm has been known for twenty years [19], and no better approximation algorithm has been found until now. Slightly better approximation guarantees are achievable over bounded-degree graphs <ref> [27] </ref>. On the negative side, the Min Vertex Cover problem has been shown to be Max SNP-hard even when restricted to graphs with maximum degree 3 by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [29]. Their reduction is from Max 3-Sat and uses explicit construction of expander graphs [16].

Reference-contexts: Using this new approach, in a short while, a lot of increasingly strong non-approximability results were given for several problems. The verifier developed by Arora et al. [3] yielded, for several constant-factor approximable problems (namely, all the Max SNP-hard problems <ref> [29] </ref>), a lower bound on their approximability. Lund and Yannakakis successively gave other explicit lower bounds on the approximability of the Min Node Coloring and the Min Set Cover problems. <p> Slightly better approximation guarantees are achievable over bounded-degree graphs [27]. On the negative side, the Min Vertex Cover problem has been shown to be Max SNP-hard even when restricted to graphs with maximum degree 3 by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [29] </ref>. Their reduction is from Max 3-Sat and uses explicit construction of expander graphs [16]. Combining this reduction, the non-approximability results by Bellare et al. [5] and the best known explicit construction of expanders [25], one can show that Min Vertex Cover is not 1.00036-approximable on bounded degree graphs. <p> It is possible to define PTAS-preserving reductions among APX problems and show natural completeness results [10, 12, 24]. In particular, the Min Vertex Cover problem is APX-complete even when restricted to bounded-degree graphs <ref> [29, 24] </ref>. In which follows, we summarize the main definitions from the theory of probabilistically checkable proofs and its connections with the Min Vertex Cover problem. Our exposition follows [5]. A verifier is an oracle probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine V . <p> It is easy to see that the above described reduction from FGLSS graphs to dense graphs is approximation-preserving, and, in particular, is an L-reduction <ref> [29] </ref>, and thus also an E-reduction [24] and an AP-reduction (see [9]). <p> We computed the non-approximability result for Min Steiner Tree that arises from <ref> [29, 8, 25, 5] </ref>, and it is about 1 + 1=5600. More generally, there is a linear relation between the hardness ratio that one can prove for the Max 3-Sat problem and the consequent hardness ratio implied for the Min Steiner Tree problem.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, much recent work has been devoted to improve the reductions from verifiers to optimization problems and those between problems themselves. Improved reductions yielded several recent breakthrough in approximability theory. For example, making heavy use of Raz's Parallel Repetition Theorem <ref> [30] </ref>, and tightening a previous reduction given by Lund and Yan-nakakis [26], Feige [13] has recently shown a tight approximation lower bound for Min Set Cover.
