Reference-contexts: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of efficient approximability of the dense instances of NP-hard optimization problems. Recently, the first polynomial time approximation schemes have been designed for these problems in Arora, Karger and Karpinski <ref> [AKK95] </ref>, Fernandez de la Vega [FV96], Arora, Frieze and Kaplan [AFK96], and Karpinski and Zelikovsky [KZ97b]. Later on, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Ron [GGR96], and Frieze and Kannan [FK97] gave a constant sample size approximation schemes for some dense optimization problems. <p> The problem is to find an assignment to the variables as to satisfy as many f i 's as possible. It is known that every problem A from MAX-SNP can be viewed as a MAX-k-FUNCTION-SAT problem for a fixed k (cf. [P94]). Following <ref> [AKK95] </ref> we call an instance of a MAX-SNP problem dense if the corresponding instance of MAX-k-FUNCTION-SAT has (n k ) functions. 3 Given an optimization problem A, a (meta) algorithm A is called a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) if for every fixed * &gt; 0, A is a polynomial time <p> Only a very few problems, such as KNAPSACK [IK75], and BIN PACKING [FL81], [KK82], were till recently known to have PTASs. In Arora, Karger and Karpinski <ref> [AKK95] </ref> the following general result on the existence of PTASs was proven. Proposition 1. ([AKK95]) Dense MAX-SNP problems have PTASs. The proof method involves the representation of MAX-k-FUNCTION-SAT by smooth degree-k integer programs, and the general result on approximating such programs (cf. [AKK95]). <p> In Arora, Karger and Karpinski <ref> [AKK95] </ref> the following general result on the existence of PTASs was proven. Proposition 1. ([AKK95]) Dense MAX-SNP problems have PTASs. The proof method involves the representation of MAX-k-FUNCTION-SAT by smooth degree-k integer programs, and the general result on approximating such programs (cf. [AKK95]). <p> Following <ref> [AKK95] </ref>, we have Proposition 2. ([AKK95]) Dense instances of the following problems have PTASs: MAX-CUT, MAX-DCUT, MAX-HYPERCUT (d), and DENSE-k-SUBGRAPH for k = (n). In what follows we call a graph G everywhere dense if its minimum degree is (n). <p> Consider a graph with a minimum degree ffin, and let c denote the capacity of its minimum bisection. The PTAS for BISECTION of <ref> [AKK95] </ref> consists of two algorithms, one of which is a PTAS when c ffn 2 , and the other when c &lt; ffn 2 for ff a small constant. The algorithm for c ffn 2 uses the above mentioned method for approximating smooth integer programs. <p> The algorithm can be also easily derandomized (cf. <ref> [AKK95] </ref>). Similar PTASs work for the SEPARATOR and BISECTION problems. Proposition 3. ([AKK95]) Everywhere dense instances of the following problems have PTASs: BISECTION, SEPARATOR and MIN-k-SAT.

The best known approximation ratio for the general problem is 1.644, Karpinski and Zelikovsky [KZ97a]. For the dense STEINER TREE problem the existence of a PTAS has been recently proven in Karpinski and Zelikovsky [KZ97b]. Proposition 6. ([KZ97b]) There exists a PTAS for the *-dense STEINER TREE problem.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 9. ([CT96], [KZ96]) The dense VERTEX COVER problem is MAX-SNP-hard. 8 4 Dense BANDWIDTH MINIMIZATION We discuss now the problem of approximability of dense instances of the BANDWIDTH problem. The BANDWIDTH problem has a long and very interesting history, and a number of important technical applications (cf., e.g. <ref> [CCDG82] </ref>). It belongs also to the class of so called layout problems and is one of hardest in this class ([DSS94]).

Conference, COCOON '96, </booktitle> <publisher> Springer-Verlag (1996), </publisher> <pages> pp. 333-342. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Proposition 7 and 8 show that the density do help essentially in approximating the VERTEX COVER problem. Can we expect though existence of a PTAS for the dense VERTEX COVER problem? The answer is no, as the everywhere *-dense (and *-dense) VERTEX COVER is MAX SNP-hard. (cf. [KZ96], <ref> [CT96] </ref>). This is due to the following densification construction. Start with a general instance (a graph G with n vertices) of the VERTEX COVER, and densify it by joining its all vertices with all vertices of a clique of size * 1* n. The resulting graph is everywhere *-dense.

Reference-contexts: We start with dense SET COVER problem. The general SET COVER was proven recently to have a threshold (1 o (1)) ln n for the polynomial time approximation (cf. Feige <ref> [F96] </ref>) which in fact is matching asymptotically the ap proximation ratio by the well known greedy heuristic algorithm. 6 It is shown in Karpinski and Zelikovsky [KZ96] that the greedy heuristic algorithm can be applied more efficiently towards ther dense SET COVER.

Reference-contexts: The general SET COVER was proven recently to have a threshold (1 o (1)) ln n for the polynomial time approximation (cf. Feige [F96]) which in fact is matching asymptotically the ap proximation ratio by the well known greedy heuristic algorithm. 6 It is shown in Karpinski and Zelikovsky <ref> [KZ96] </ref> that the greedy heuristic algorithm can be applied more efficiently towards ther dense SET COVER. Proposition 4. ([KZ96]) For any constant c &gt; 0 and any * &gt; 0, there is a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the *-dense SET COVER with the approximation ratio c log n. <p> Proposition 7 and 8 show that the density do help essentially in approximating the VERTEX COVER problem. Can we expect though existence of a PTAS for the dense VERTEX COVER problem? The answer is no, as the everywhere *-dense (and *-dense) VERTEX COVER is MAX SNP-hard. (cf. <ref> [KZ96] </ref>, [CT96]). This is due to the following densification construction. Start with a general instance (a graph G with n vertices) of the VERTEX COVER, and densify it by joining its all vertices with all vertices of a clique of size * 1* n. The resulting graph is everywhere *-dense. <p> The resulting graph is everywhere *-dense. An existence of ff-approximation algorithm for dense instances of VERTEX COVER entails now also ff (1+*)-approximation algorithm for the general VERTEX COVER problem which is MAX-SNP-hard. Proposition 9. ([CT96], <ref> [KZ96] </ref>) The dense VERTEX COVER problem is MAX-SNP-hard. 8 4 Dense BANDWIDTH MINIMIZATION We discuss now the problem of approximability of dense instances of the BANDWIDTH problem. The BANDWIDTH problem has a long and very interesting history, and a number of important technical applications (cf., e.g. [CCDG82]).

The balanced MAX-CUT is MAX-SNP-hard (cf. <ref> [PY91] </ref>), however by complementing a sparse graph we get a dense one on which the BISECTION is approximable. The situation with the BANDWIDTH is, in fact, even more subtle in this respect. The standard graph operations or a slight densification seem to destroy the structure of the instance completely.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, we cannot expect on the lower bound side of the dense SET COVER, its NP-hardness, as the results of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY96] </ref> imply. Proposition 5. ([KZ97b]) Unless NP DTIME [n log n ], the dense SET COVER is not NP-hard. We conjecture that SET COVER cannot be approximated to within a constant factor. Conjecture 1. The dense SET COVER cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within a constant approximation ratio.

Reference-contexts: This makes the BANDWIDTH one of the very rare combinatorial problems which are compu-tationally 'hard' for trees. Interestingly, the problem is efficiently computable for complete trees <ref> [Sm95] </ref>. Only a very few special cases of this problem are known to have sublinear approximation ratio algorithms, among them log n-approximation algorithm for the caterpillars ([HMM91]). There are no sublinear n * -approximation algorithms known for the BANDWIDTH problem even if restricted to trees.
