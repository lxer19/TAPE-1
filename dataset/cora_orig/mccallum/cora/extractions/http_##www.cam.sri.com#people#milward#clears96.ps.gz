Abstract: This paper describes an interactive graphical environment for computational semantics. The system provides a teaching tool, a stand alone extendible gra-pher, and a library of algorithms together with test suites. The teaching tool allows users to work step by step through derivations of semantic representations, and to compare the properties of various semantic formalisms such as Intensional Logic, DRT, and Situation Semantics. The system is freely available on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: reducer etc. using a small amount of code. 5 The Graphical Interface A major part of our work on the educational tool was the development of a general graphical browser or grapher for the graphical notations used in computational linguistics, especially those in computational semantics such as trees, Attribute-Value-Matrices, EKN <ref> (Barwise and Cooper, 1993) </ref> and DRSs. The grapher was written in Tcl/Tk, a programming system for developing graphical user interfaces (Ousterhout, 1994).

Reference-contexts: In this section we show how a user can interactively explore the step-by-step construction of a semantic representation out of a syntax tree. Figures 1 and 2 show a possible initial display for the sentence "Anna laughs" in a compositional version of DRT <ref> (Bos et al., 1994) </ref> and in `Montague Grammar' (Dowty et al., 1981). The user controls the semantic construction process by moving to particular nodes in the derivation tree, and performing operations by using mouse double-clicks, or by selecting from a pop-up menu. <p> The user can try out various options for semantic construction by using a menu to set various parameters.

Reference-contexts: The library is being expanded with routines for semantic construction driven by semantic types. It is also intended to integrate a wider range of grammars, parsing strategies and pronoun resolution strategies. For program documentation we largely have followed the approach taken in LEDA <ref> (Naher, 1993) </ref>). Apart from the routines concerned directly with computational semantics, there are also routines designed to aid application developers who want to provide a graphical output for semantic representations. These routines are mainly concerned with translating from Prolog syntax into the description string syntax used by the CLiG grapher.

Reference-contexts: The grapher was written in Tcl/Tk, a programming system for developing graphical user interfaces <ref> (Ousterhout, 1994) </ref>. Two attributes of Tcl/Tk which were important for this application were the provision of translation routines from graphic canvasses into Postscript (allowing generation of diagrams such as Figures 1 to 4), and the ease of providing scaling routines for zooming.
