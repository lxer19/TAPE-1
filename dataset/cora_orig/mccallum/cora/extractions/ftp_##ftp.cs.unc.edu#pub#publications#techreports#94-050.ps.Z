Reference-contexts: An interesting and elegant solution to the problem of polygonal simplification by using wavelets has been presented in [DeRose et al 93]. In computational geometry literature it has been shown that computing the minimal-facet *-approximation is NP-hard for convex polytopes [Das & Joseph 90] as well as polyhedral terrains <ref> [Agarwal & Suri 94] </ref>. Thus, algorithms to these problems have evolved around finding polynomial-time approximations that are close to the optimal. <p> This has recently been improved in [Clarkson 93] where Clarkson proposes a randomized algorithm for computing an approximation of size O (k o log k o ) in expected time O (k o n 1+ffi ), where ffi can be an arbitrarily small positive number. Working with polyhedral terrains, <ref> [Agarwal & Suri 94] </ref> present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an *-approximation of size O (k o log k o ) to a polyhedral terrain.

Reference-contexts: This determination is done in linear time over the whole molecule by subdividing the molecule using a global grid. Next, we construct a feasible cell (which is very similar to a power-cell <ref> [Aurenhammer 87] </ref>; for exact definition see Chapter IV) around each atom by using these neighbors. If there are k neighbors for an atom, this stage takes O (k log k) time. Next the surface is generated for each atom from its power-cell in O (k) time. <p> If the average number of neighbors for an atom is k, then we can just compute an approximation to the power cell (the concept of a power cell is presented in <ref> [Aurenhammer 87] </ref> and briefly reviewed in Section 4.2.1), which we call a feasible cell (the definition of a feasible cell appears in Section 4.2.3), by considering only these neighbors. Each feasible cell can be computed in parallel in time O (k log k). <p> Thus P C i is the set of all the points that are closer to c i than any other sphere center c j , assuming that the distance is measured in the power metric. The definition and algorithms for computing power cells have been given by Aurenhammer in <ref> [Aurenhammer 87] </ref>. 4.2.2 Determination of Neighboring Atoms Determination of neighboring atoms can be done by spatial grid subdivision into cubical voxels, and assigning atoms to the appropriate voxels.

Reference-contexts: The ff-hulls have been defined for weighted points in [Edelsbrunner 92]. These can be constructed from regular triangulations of the weighted points, which are dual to the power diagrams as defined by Aurenhammer <ref> [Aurenhammer 88] </ref>. 3.4 Detail Hierarchies for Polylines We shall use the term polyline to denote a zero-order continuous (i.e. end-point continuity) chain of line segments none of which crosses another.

Reference-contexts: Some work has been done in the incremental computation of Voronoi diagrams of moving points in a plane <ref> [Aurenhammer 91] </ref>, but to the best of my knowledge no work has been done in three dimensions for spheres of unequal radii. Research into efficient algorithms that exploit the temporal coherence would also benefit interactive docking applications.

Reference-contexts: The main reason for this is our attempts to simultaneously satisfy the conflicting goals of scene realism and real-time performance. These attempts can be broadly classified into two categories | image-space refinement and object-space refinement. In image-space refinement approaches <ref> [Bergman et al 86] </ref>, the scene is first rendered as a low-quality image while the user is constantly changing his viewpoint. Once the user stops and the viewpoint is fixed, a progressively detailed rendering of the scene is then done by the renderer in due time.

Reference-contexts: this approach over the basic greedy heuristic is that we have a completely valid mesh at every stage of our algorithm and so our solution does not have the visible artifacts arising from numerical precision problems. 7.6.4 Estimating Solution Quality It has been shown in the literature [Lovasz 75] and <ref> [Chvatal 79] </ref> that the greedy heuristic yields a solution which is guaranteed to be within a factor of (1 + ln d) of the optimal, where d is the maximum number of elements in any set t j , i.e. the maximum number of vertices covered by a candidate triangle.

Reference-contexts: refinement approaches, a hierarchy of object descriptions is stored and depending on how important the object is to the scene, an appropriate level-of-detail of the object is used for rendering - 10 (a) ff = 1:0 A; fi = 1:0 A (b) ff = 1:0 A; fi = 2:4 A <ref> [Clark 76] </ref>, [Cosman & Schumacker 81], [Crow 82], and [Funkhouser & Sequin 93]. 1.4.1 Modeling in Computer Graphics At present, the most common form of model representation in computer graphics is a planar polygonal description.

The basic idea is to use simplified models for objects that are perceptually less important and detailed models for objects that are more important. Perceptual importance is in general difficult to define precisely.

Reference-contexts: At present, we correctly handle only those cases where the cusps are either minor or can be easily determined by limited local checks. A general approach to this problem needs to be developed. This problem was first addressed in <ref> [Connolly 85] </ref>. Work on this problem has also been reported by Sanner [Sanner 92, Sanner 94]. 8.5 Polygonal Simplification We have presented an approach that is global and deterministic. Other approaches to this problem have been local and deterministic.

Our goal has been to compute and display these surfaces at interactive rates, by taking advantage of results from computational geometry, making further algorithmic improvements, and parallelizing the computations. Interactive computation and display of molecular surfaces should benefit biochemists in three important ways.

The basic idea is to use simplified models for objects that are perceptually less important and detailed models for objects that are more important. Perceptual importance is in general difficult to define precisely. <p> A prerequisite to this approach for rendering complex datasets is a method to simplify object models. Manual simplification of models is possible and has been done in the past <ref> [Cosman & Schumacker 81] </ref>. However, such simplification is time-consuming and may not even be feasible for large datasets whose complexity is in the order of millions of polygons. In this chapter, we present an algorithm for computing various levels of detail of a given polygonal model.

Reference-contexts: In our problem definition we have stated that A should have a minimal number of polygons. It turns out that achieving minimality for A is NP-hard even for the simple case where I is a convex polytope <ref> [Das & Joseph 90] </ref>. <p> An interesting and elegant solution to the problem of polygonal simplification by using wavelets has been presented in [DeRose et al 93]. In computational geometry literature it has been shown that computing the minimal-facet *-approximation is NP-hard for convex polytopes <ref> [Das & Joseph 90] </ref> as well as polyhedral terrains [Agarwal & Suri 94]. Thus, algorithms to these problems have evolved around finding polynomial-time approximations that are close to the optimal.

Voronoi diagrams are defined for simple points (or circles of equal radii) whereas power diagrams are defined for circles of possibly unequal radii. An easy way to understand this is through the following example.

Reference-contexts: We shall use the term *-approximation to refer to this second approximation problem. The ff-approximation and the *-approximation are both quite general problems and are useful in areas other than molecular modeling. The ff-approximation problem can be used to compute a detail hierarchy of ff-hulls and ff-shapes <ref> [Edelsbrunner & Mucke 94, Edelsbrunner 92, Edelsbrunner et al 83] </ref> that are useful in such diverse fields as astronomy, biochemistry, statistics, and computer graphics. <p> The ff-hulls for positive and negative values of alpha are 28 shown in Figure 3.4 (a) and (b), respectively. The definition of ff-hulls has been extended to three and higher dimensions by Edelsbrunner and Mucke <ref> [Edelsbrunner & Mucke 94] </ref>. The combinatorial complexity of ff-hulls over n points in R d has been shown to be equivalent to that of the Delaunay triangulation of these points in the worst case. <p> Richards [Richards 77] had also suggested computing the molecular surface by computing a 3D Voronoi diagram first and then using its faces to determine which nearby atoms to consider. Edelsbrunner and Mucke <ref> [Edelsbrunner & Mucke 94] </ref> extend the definition of ff-hulls to points in three dimensions.

For 0 ff 1, the ff-hull of P is defined as the surface of the complement of the union of all empty ff-balls <ref> [Edelsbrunner 92] </ref>. The smooth molecular surface (as defined by Richards [Richards 77]) for a probe sphere of radius R is equivalent to the three-dimensional weighted ff-hull (as defined by Edelsbrunner in [Edelsbrunner 92]) with ff = R. <p> the ff-hull of P is defined as the surface of the complement of the union of all empty ff-balls <ref> [Edelsbrunner 92] </ref>. The smooth molecular surface (as defined by Richards [Richards 77]) for a probe sphere of radius R is equivalent to the three-dimensional weighted ff-hull (as defined by Edelsbrunner in [Edelsbrunner 92]) with ff = R. The definition for molecular surfaces that appears above is that of a complete molecular surface, i.e. a surface that completely envelopes a molecule. This is useful for visualizing the surface of a single molecule. <p> The notation used for defining the alpha hulls has changed in going from [Edelsbrunner et al 83] to <ref> [Edelsbrunner 92] </ref>. We shall use the more recent notation. The term open disc is used to refer to the points that lie strictly inside a circle and the term closed disc is used to refer to the points that lie on or inside a circle. <p> Thus in a plane, ff-hull of a set of n points can be constructed in 29 time O (n log n) and in three dimensions in time O (n 2 ).

Edelsbrunner in <ref> [Edelsbrunner 92] </ref>, extends the concept of ff-shapes to deal with weighted points (i.e. spheres with possibly unequal and non-zero radii) in three dimensions. An ff-shape of a set of weighted points P w is a subset of the regular triangulation of P w . <p> The method given by Edels-brunner <ref> [Edelsbrunner 92] </ref> finds these edges by first computing the entire three-dimensional regular triangulation, an O (n 2 ) approach.

Our problem is somewhat different and thus remains interesting enough. Another approach to computing the areas and volumes could be to try a Monte-Carlo-based approximation to the actual areas and volumes.

As mentioned before, one could define the convex hull of a set of points P in a plane as the intersection of all half-planes that contain P . <p> For ff &gt; 0, the ff-hull of a set of points P in two dimensions is defined to be the complement of the union of all disks of radius ff containing no points of P .

The term open disc is used to refer to the points that lie strictly inside a circle and the term closed disc is used to refer to the points that lie on or inside a circle. <p> If we generalize the notion of ff-hulls over point-sets to the corresponding hulls over spheres of unequal radii in three dimensions, we would get the Richards's smooth molecular surface (along with the surfaces defining the interior cavities of the molecule). It has been shown in <ref> [Edelsbrunner et al 83] </ref> that it is possible to compute the ff-hulls from the Voronoi 33 diagram of the points of P . For ff = 1 the ff-hull over the set of points P is the same as their convex hull.

Reference-contexts: A set of spheres is said to form a k-fold packing if each point of the space belongs to at most k spheres. Let the maximum density of a k-fold spherical packing in n-dimensions be denoted by ffi k (n). Fejes Toth <ref> [Fejes Toth 79] </ref> has shown that ffi 2 (3) 1:826. The results reproduced above are those most relevant to our research. They form but a tiny fraction of the results from the deeply exciting mathematical theory of packing and covering. <p> As can be seen in Figure 5.4, a unit sphere intersects the shell forming two spherical caps one on the shell and the other on the unit sphere. Let the minimum angular radius of the spherical caps on the unit spheres be min . G. Fejes Toth <ref> [Fejes Toth 79] </ref> has claimed that for this case min arcsin ( q (4 r)=2), and indeed it is easy enough to verify this. Now, to bound the number of unit spheres, we just need to bound the number of spherical caps on the shell (0; p r).

The basic idea is to use simplified models for objects that are perceptually less important and detailed models for objects that are more important. Perceptual importance is in general difficult to define precisely.

Reference-contexts: cardinality, i.e. the number of vertices covered by it, solution of this set partitioning problem will yield the smallest number of triangles that cover all the vertices of the input model P. 7.6.2 The Greedy Heuristic The set cover and the set partition problems are both known to be NP-complete <ref> [Garey & Johnson 79] </ref>. Therefore any hopes of computing an optimal solution to our polygonal approximation problem are remote. However, there exist several heuristics which compute approximate solutions to these problems. These heuristics generate solutions that have been in general found to be reasonably close to the optimal.
