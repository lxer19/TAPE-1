Title: Constraint Based Topology Design of ATM Networks  
Author: Hongzhou Ma Jonathan Turner 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel network design model (constraint-based model) is described, and a network design tool, implemented in Java, is used to explore alternative designs for networks joining major U.S. cities. The characteristics of different topologies, such as star, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Delau-nay Triangulation, are compared under a variety of traffic constraints. Our results allow us to characterize the conditions that favor the different topologies.

Reference-contexts: Because of the lack of reliable data, such as distribution of bandwidth, holding times, size and behavior of multicast calls, and the difficulty of predicting future change, the classical telecommunication network planning techniques <ref> [1] </ref> are less relevant to this new generation of networks. A constraint-based network design model is proposed. It leads to networks that can handle any combination of traffic that lies within user-specified constraints. These networks are less sensitive to assumptions, and allow greater confidence in resulting designs.

Reference-contexts: A constraint-based network design model is proposed. It leads to networks that can handle any combination of traffic that lies within user-specified constraints. These networks are less sensitive to assumptions, and allow greater confidence in resulting designs. Previous research on flat traffic constraints <ref> [2, 4, 3] </ref> showed that when the link cost is linear to capacity, the problem of finding a minimum cost, nonblocking network is NP-Complete even for symmetric source and sink capacities. <p> Our experiments shows that, with source/sink constraints only, acyclic networks are always cheaper than cyclic networks. This implies that tree structure is the least expensive, and it's been proved that the star is best among trees <ref> [2] </ref>, so the star network is the cheapest among all nonblocking networks in the presence of source/sink constraints alone. In the networks for major cities studied, the closeness of the cost of the best star to the lower bound, also supports this observation.

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation <ref> [5] </ref> can be useful in the design of nonblocking networks. The Delaunay triangulation is closely related to the Voronoi diagram. Let P = fp 1 ; p 2 ; ; p n g be a set of points in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane. These are called the sites.

Reference-contexts: Among them, 149 million people resided in the 50 largest cities, accounting for 57.3% of the total. These cities provide useful test cases for the study of alternative network designs. Constraint based ATM network design was applied to these cities <ref> [6] </ref>. Suppose a single switch is located in each city. We set the source and sink capacities to be proportional to the population in the city, assuming that the bandwidth requirement for each person is 1Mb/s. So the switch in St. Louis would have total capacity of 2540Gb/s.

Reference-contexts: This is a combination of pairwise and localized traffic constraint <ref> [7] </ref>. When the number of switches, n, is very large, we can think of the switches as continuously spread on the surface, with a surface density of = n=4.

Reference-contexts: When traffic is localized, the MST is a much better starting point for construction cost effective networks. Topologies having more features, such as Euclidean spanner <ref> [8] </ref>, a spanning tree that simultaneously approximates a shortest-path tree and a minimum spanning tree [9] could be more useful than the MST. Distributed routing is useful only for networks with a large number of switches The costs are normalized.
