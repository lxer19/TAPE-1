Reference-contexts: Thus, NLP techniques are faced with the challenge that the basic methods of statistical IR have picked some of the easy fruit off the tree. The result is that, to date, choices among alternate statistical retrieval methods have had much more impact than choices among alternate text representations <ref> [1] </ref>. This should not discourage research into NLP applications in IR, but does suggest careful examination of where NLP is likely to have the most impact. 8 Data retrieval Within IR we distinguish DR from other forms of retrieval.

Reference-contexts: New approaches are also possible. Accurate and highly efficient syntactic taggers are available, and some compound terms, for instance head nouns and premodifiers, are easily extractable from tagged text <ref> [3] </ref>. A variety of strategies for finding important collocations in large corpora have been developed [27], and may provide an improvement over traditional IR methods for statistical phrase formation. Compound terms must not only be generated, but also selected among and weighted.

Reference-contexts: Natural language access to databases, replacing the use of formal query languages, has been investigated for three decades and there are well-established commercial systems <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. Natural language clearly offers advantages in convenience and flexibility, but there are correspondingly major challenges in query interpretation, precisely because query expression is decoupled from search formulation.

Reference-contexts: Thirdly and most important, many end users have little skill or experience in formulating initial search requests, or in modifying their requests after observing failures. Even when relevance feedback is available, it still needs to be leveraged from a sensible starting point <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The occurrence of the two words in separate paragraphs would provide much less evidence, but more than the amount given by the presence of just one of the words, or of a related word <ref> [6, 30] </ref>. Thirdly, basic compound units of the type described above would not typically be further combined into frames, templates, or other structured units. (Though there might be exceptions, as discussed in Section 9.) The description of a document would be an unordered set of `phrase' units and individual words.

Reference-contexts: First, given the proven value of statistical weighting, any units that NLP produces should be filtered and weighted by the statistics of their occurrences in the database searched and perhaps in other textbases as well <ref> [8, 18] </ref>. The evidence is that with compounds this must be done particularly carefully [9]. Secondly, we have stressed the importance of late binding and sensitivity to the uncertainty of evidence. Compound terms will not be identified as definitely occurring or not occurring in a document.

Reference-contexts: Many controlled languages allow this, and it has been found effective to a degree when done `statistically', i.e. on a simple co-location basis within a text window <ref> [9] </ref>. While linguistically grounded compounds have not been found more effective that statistical ones in past studies, this may change in a TR context. The proposals which follow develop these themes, as an approach that might give better results than the simple baseline described earlier. <p> First, given the proven value of statistical weighting, any units that NLP produces should be filtered and weighted by the statistics of their occurrences in the database searched and perhaps in other textbases as well [8, 18].

Secondly, we have stressed the importance of late binding and sensitivity to the uncertainty of evidence. Compound terms will not be identified as definitely occurring or not occurring in a document. Rather, each document will provide some amount of evidence for the presence of each known concept.
