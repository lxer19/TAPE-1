Abstract: We propose a new polyinstantiation integrity constraint for multilevel relations based on the intuitive idea that every entity in a relation can have at most one tuple for every access class. We discuss the consequences of this property and some of its variations.

Reference-contexts: The incomparable labels are required for some of the more subtle points. Let us describe multiple tuples for the same real world entity as polyinstantiated tuples. Polyinstan-tiation integrity is concerned with controlling the legitimate manner in which polyinstantiated tuples can arise. Now the SeaView model <ref> [1, 4] </ref> can accommodate either instances 1, 2, 3, 8 or 1, 4 of table 1 (c) within a single schema. In [3] it is argued that all eight of these instances have realistic and useful interpretations. Therefore a general multilevel model should accommodate all eight within a single schema. <p> The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the basic definitions of multilevel relations to establish the background for this paper and properties common to all three models. Our review is necessarily brief. For detailed discussion on the motivation underlying these properties see <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>. Sections 3 and 4 review the polyinstantiation integrity constraints of the Oakland and SeaView models. Section 5 formulates our new constraint, resulting in the Franconia model.

These requirements are quite reasonable and some intuitive justification for them is given in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The standard relational model also has a referential integrity property to ensure consistency of references from one relation to another. In this paper our fo-cus is on single relations, so the multilevel analog of referential integrity is not relevant. <p> The ambiguity is less compelling in this situation because we do have new data, viz., Rigel/S, revealed at the S level. At any rate, PI-null rules out instance 3 as invalid. 4 THE SEAVIEW MODEL The SeaView model <ref> [1, 4] </ref> requires the following PI constraint in addition to PI-FD.
