Reference-contexts: There must be a way to transfer the metadata along with the data, so that complete information is available at the remote site. This function requires an schema transfer protocol, and we are working on the definition of this protocol <ref> [Ahme93] </ref>. 5.2 Storage Controller The Berkeley hardware group has pioneered the development of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) [Katz89, Katz91a]. RAID requires a sophisticated I/O controller be placed between the CPU and the collection of disk devices. <p> The DIL will be used to specify the export schemas of data objects based on an extendible common scientific and geometric data model. * 01 Mar: <ref> [Ahme93] </ref> completed. * 15 Mar: Devise a scientific and geometric data model for Earth science application; design an extendible language specification for the DIL. * 30 Mar: Discuss DIL implementation approach with Sequoia 2000 DBMS group, NCSAs HDF group, and possibly with NASA GSFCs CDF group. 36 Sequoia Architecture and Plan

Reference-contexts: In short, they want a distributed file system, that supports location transparency. Several file systems have been designed that begin to serve this need. The most robust is arguably the Andrew File System [Harr91], developed at CMU. The improvements that we expect to make to the Andrew design are <ref> [And92] </ref>: * optimizing for network bandwidth instead of server CPU load; * caching of file blocks, instead of caching whole files; * the ability to disable caching, when data being fetched are too large to fit in local cache; * write back cache coherence, so that when temporary files are created

Reference-contexts: Sequoia 2000 thus needs grease and glue, so that interface modules to other packages, e.g. S <ref> [Beck84] </ref>, are easily written. Sequoia Architecture and Plan 15 4 Use of Sequoia 2000 Environment In this section we report on the planned utilization of the Sequoia 2000 environment by our clients. First, we report on the common data collection and schema construction effort.

Reference-contexts: Tioga [Ston92b] is a joint project between Berkeley and SDSC. A prototype early Tioga <ref> [Chen91] </ref> is currently running. Lassen: The third element of our application layer is Lassen, a browsing capability for textual information. Lassen has two components.

Reference-contexts: Moreover the interpretation of the data and the sampling scheme to correlate the vegetation with surface energy exchange requires information about the topography <ref> [Dav92] </ref>. 4. Analysis of the Earth's radiation budget and estimation of the surface radiation from geostationary satellite data. Estimation of the surface radiation budget is needed for studies of the land- and ocean-surface climatology and their relationship with productivity.

Reference-contexts: If the network manages abstracts, then it will use them to automatically lower resolution to eliminate congestion. Much research on the optimization of network abstracts (called hierarchical encoding of data in that community) has been presented <ref> [Dix91] </ref>. Lastly, in the file system case, abstracts would be defined for files. There are Sequoia 2000 researchers pursuing all four possibilities. 3.3 Compression The Sequoia 2000 clients are open to any compression scheme as long as it is lossless.

Reference-contexts: Together these data sets enable estimation of different snow properties (coverage, albedo, grain size, liquid water content, depth and density) at different spatial and temporal scales <ref> [Doz81, Doz89, Nol92, Shi91] </ref>. 2.

Reference-contexts: To have any chance of meeting Sequoia 2000 client needs, a DBMS must support spatial data structures such as points, lines, polygons, and large multidimensional arrays (e.g. satellite images). Currently these data are not supported by popular general-purpose relational and object-oriented DBMSs <ref> [Ston91, Doz92] </ref>. The best fit to Sequoia 2000 client needs would be either a special-purpose Geographic Information System (GIS), or a next-generation prototype DBMS. Since we have one such next-generation system within the project, we have elected to focus our DBMS work on this system, POSTGRES [Ston90, Ston91b].

Reference-contexts: There are UniTree implementation for many popular platforms, and GA is porting UniTree to the ULTRIX/Footprint platform adopted by Sequoia 2000. Inclusion of UniTree will allow Sequoia 2000 clients to use a commercial, presumably robust, file system for tertiary storage. Our fourth file system is EpochServ <ref> [Epoc92] </ref>, another commercial file system. EpochServ was chosen to provide a second highly robust tertiary storage file system for Sequoia 2000 data. We plan to conduct a bakeoff of the four file systems on all four of our robotic storage devices, using two large benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: Over the next year, we expect to: * Install phrase recognition software in Cheshire that will extend its indexing capabilities from single words to noun phases. Other research has shown this to be a good way to increase the precision of the answer to a query <ref> [Evan91] </ref>. 10 Sequoia Architecture and Plan * Move Lassen to a Z39.50 protocol [Lyn91, Lyn92, Zee92]. The client portion of Lassen would emit Z39.50 and we would write a Z39.50 to POSTGRES translator on the server side.

Reference-contexts: This service uses the RTIP protocols instead of TCP/IP, and requires a set-up phase for a connection that will allocate bandwidth on all the lines and in all the switches. <ref> [Ferr90] </ref>. The network researchers are concerned that ULTRIX copies every byte four 12 Sequoia Architecture and Plan times between retrieving it from storage and sending it out over a network connection. Even Alphas may not be fast enough to overcome this bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: Then, if they found something of interest, they would like to zoom in and increase the resolution, usually to the maximum available in the original data. This ability to change the amount of resolution in an image dynamically has been termed abstracts <ref> [Fine92] </ref>. Abstracts are a much more powerful construct than merely providing resolution adjustment. Obtaining more detail may entail moving from one representation to another.

Reference-contexts: For example, one could have an icon for a document, zoom in to see the (textual) abstract, and then zoom in further to see the entire document. This use of abstracts was popularized in the DBMS community by SDMS <ref> [Her80] </ref>. Sequoia 2000 clients wish to have abstracts. However, they could be managed by any combination of the visualization tool, the network, the DBMS, or the file system. In the visualization tool case, abstracts are defined for boxes-and-arrows networks [Ston92b].

Analysis of terrestrial vegetation using data from the Landsat TM and AIR-SAR. These investigations require correction for the topographic influence, hence the data must be co-registered to digital elevation models, and the processing algorithms for the TM data are different in the shadowed areas.

Reference-contexts: This function requires an schema transfer protocol, and we are working on the definition of this protocol [Ahme93]. 5.2 Storage Controller The Berkeley hardware group has pioneered the development of Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) <ref> [Katz89, Katz91a] </ref>. RAID requires a sophisticated I/O controller be placed between the CPU and the collection of disk devices. This I/O controller must keep the redundant parity information up to date and map logical blocks to physical locations on the media.

Reference-contexts: The same group is now focused on the possible construction of a better I/O controller that might control data migration between secondary and tertiary storage as well as play a part in any end-to-end compression scheme <ref> [Katz91b] </ref>. A last area of possible research is the design of a backup scheme for tertiary storage. It is impossible to take a dump of a 10-terabyte storage system. At 1 Mbyte/sec, 10 7 seconds, about 4 months, would be needed.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, IDL is liked for its more flexible 2D graphics features. Both IDL and AVS allow a user to read and write file data. To connect to the DBMS, we have written an AVS-POSTGRES bridge <ref> [Koch93] </ref>. This program allows one to construct an ad-hoc POSTGRES query and pipe the result into an AVS boxes-and-arrows network. Our clients can thus use AVS for further processing of any data retrieved from the DBMS.

Reference-contexts: Two of these file systems are academic prototypes, written by Sequoia 2000 researchers, and two are commercial products. All file systems will support a standard UNIX file system interface. The first file system is Highlight <ref> [Kohl93] </ref>. It is an extension of the Log-structured File System (LFS) pioneered for disk devices by Rosenblum and Ouster-hout [Ros92]. LFS treats a disk device as a single continuous log onto which newly-written disk blocks are appended. Blocks are never overwritten, so a disk device can always be written sequentially.

Reference-contexts: Tioga [Ston92b] is a joint project between Berkeley and SDSC. A prototype early Tioga [Chen91] is currently running. Lassen: The third element of our application layer is Lassen, a browsing capability for textual information. Lassen has two components.

Reference-contexts: A third goal of this project is to couple the ESM to a visualization system <ref> [Spa93, Mech93] </ref>. Model output in AVS can be browsed through the AVS-POSTGRES bridge described earlier, and this capability will provide after the fact visualization facilities. In addition, the Tioga system will be used by UCLA researchers when it becomes available.

Reference-contexts: Lassen has two components.

Reference-contexts: Typically, these applications involve image processing-of a single image or a combination of images-combined with surface or atmospheric measurements and models of the processes. They differ from traditional image processing analyses <ref> [Shap92] </ref> in that the image data represent geophysical units, for example the radiance received by the satellite above the atmosphere in a specific spectral band.

Reference-contexts: A third goal of this project is to couple the ESM to a visualization system <ref> [Spa93, Mech93] </ref>. Model output in AVS can be browsed through the AVS-POSTGRES bridge described earlier, and this capability will provide after the fact visualization facilities. In addition, the Tioga system will be used by UCLA researchers when it becomes available.

Reference-contexts: The best fit to Sequoia 2000 client needs would be either a special-purpose Geographic Information System (GIS), or a next-generation prototype DBMS. Since we have one such next-generation system within the project, we have elected to focus our DBMS work on this system, POSTGRES <ref> [Ston90, Ston91b] </ref>. To make POSTGRES suitable for Sequoia 2000 use, we require a schema for all Sequoia 2000 data. This database design process is evolving as a cooperative exercise between various database experts at Berkeley, SDSC, CERL, and SAIC.

Reference-contexts: To have any chance of meeting Sequoia 2000 client needs, a DBMS must support spatial data structures such as points, lines, polygons, and large multidimensional arrays (e.g. satellite images). Currently these data are not supported by popular general-purpose relational and object-oriented DBMSs <ref> [Ston91, Doz92] </ref>. The best fit to Sequoia 2000 client needs would be either a special-purpose Geographic Information System (GIS), or a next-generation prototype DBMS. Since we have one such next-generation system within the project, we have elected to focus our DBMS work on this system, POSTGRES [Ston90, Ston91b].

Reference-contexts: Simulating files on top of DBMS large objects has several advantages. First, DBMS services such as transaction management and security are automatically supported for files. In addition, novel characteristics of POSTGRES, including time travel and an extensible type system for all DBMS objects <ref> [Ston91b] </ref>, are automatically available for files. Of course, the possible disadvantage of files on top of a DBMS is poor performance, but our experiments show that Inversion performance is exceedingly good when large amounts of data are read and written [Ols93], a characteristic of the Sequoia 2000 workload. <p> The best fit to Sequoia 2000 client needs would be either a special-purpose Geographic Information System (GIS), or a next-generation prototype DBMS.

Reference-contexts: The first is Cheshire [Lars91], a facility for constructing weighted keyword indices for the words in a document, stored as an instance of some particular POSTGRES type. Cheshire builds on the pioneering work of the Cornell Smart system [Salt71] and operates as the action part of a POSTGRES rule <ref> [Ston92a] </ref> that is triggered on each document insertion, update, or removal. The second piece of Lassen is a front-end query tool with natural language understanding, allowing a user to ask for all documents that satisfy a collection of keywords, by inquiring in a subset of Natural English.

Reference-contexts: The user interface presents a flight simulator paradigm for browsing the output of a boxes-and-arrows network, allowing users to navigate around their data and then zoom in to obtain additional data on items of particular interest. Tioga <ref> [Ston92b] </ref> is a joint project between Berkeley and SDSC. A prototype early Tioga [Chen91] is currently running. Lassen: The third element of our application layer is Lassen, a browsing capability for textual information. Lassen has two components. <p> In short, guaranteed delivery is a collection of contracts that must be adhered to by the DBMS, the visualization package, the storage system, and the network <ref> [Ston92b] </ref>. 3.2 Abstracts The Sequoia 2000 visualization process needs abstracts. Consider again the Hurricane Andrew example. Clients might initially want to browse the hurricane at 100fi100 resolution. <p> Sequoia 2000 clients wish to have abstracts. However, they could be managed by any combination of the visualization tool, the network, the DBMS, or the file system. In the visualization tool case, abstracts are defined for boxes-and-arrows networks <ref> [Ston92b] </ref>. In the DBMS case, abstracts would be defined for individual data elements or for data classes. If the network manages abstracts, then it will use them to automatically lower resolution to eliminate congestion.

Reference-contexts: Highlight should give excellent performance on a workload that is write-mostly. This should be an excellent match to the Sequoia 2000 environment, whose clients want to archive vast amounts of data. The second file system is Inversion <ref> [Ston93a] </ref>, which is built on top of the POSTGRES DBMS. Like most DBMSs, POSTGRES supports binary large objects (blobs), which can contain an arbitrary number of variable-length byte strings. These large objects are stored in a customized storage system directly on a raw (i.e. non-file-structure) storage device.

Reference-contexts: We plan to conduct a bakeoff of the four file systems on all four of our robotic storage devices, using two large benchmarks. The first is the national version of the Sequoia 2000 benchmark, a 25-Gbyte dataset and associated queries, specified as a project standard <ref> [Ston93b] </ref>. The second benchmark is a scientific and engineering workload derived from a tracing study of the Cray supercomputer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) [Mill92].

Reference-contexts: Lastly, Mariposa will attempt to make placement decisions by constructing a rule engine that will interpret a rule base. In this way, it is easy for a user to freely change the behavior of the system by changing a few rules. Mariposa is at its initial design stage <ref> [Ston93c] </ref>. 6 Implementation Plan This section contains a collection of milestones that we expect to achieve during the remainder of Phase 1 of the project. They are ordered by layer in the architecture.
