Abstract: The fairly recent proofs of the irrationality of log 2; 2 ; (3) and various values of polylogarithms are re-examined by using a particular family of orthogonal forms. This allows us to give a uniform and arguably more natural treatment of these results.

Reference-contexts: To have the best possible upper bound for the remaining maximum in the above estimate, we wish to find a polynomial of degree k 1 such that the deviation of 1 xff from P k1 is minimized. This problem was solved by Tchebysheff and is discussed by Akhieser <ref> [1] </ref> as in the next lemma from which the right hand-side inequality of the theorem follows. The non-vanishing of the integral follows from the orthogonality conditions. Each F l is a polynomial of exact degree l. <p> 2 v + v ; ff := 2 a + a ; jaj &lt; 1; M := (1 a 2 ) 2 10PETER BORWEIN, WILLEM DYKSHOORN, TAM AS ERD ELYI, AND JOHN ZHANG and jxj1 fi fi x ff fi fi deviates the least from 1 xff on the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> in the uniform norm.

Reference-contexts: This leads to orthogonal functions that generalize Legendre polynomials and are of the form n1 X A j;l (x) log j x where each A j;l (x) is a polynomial of degree l. Legendre polynomials are closely tied to irrationality questions concerning logarithms ([2], <ref> [6, Chapter 11] </ref>) and higher order analogues prove to be the basis for dealing with the irrationality of the polylogarithm X z n We argue that the irrationality proofs flow quite naturally from this point of view.
