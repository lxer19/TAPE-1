Abstract: Many sensor-based control systems are dynamically changing, and thus require a exible scheduler. The rate monotonic (RM) real-time scheduling algorithm does not support such dynamic systems very well. On the other hand, with earliest-deadline-first (EDF) and minimum-laxity-first (MLF) dynamic scheduling algorithms, a transient overload in the system may cause a critical task to fail, which is certainly undesirable. This paper proposes a new real-time scheduling algorithm, which we call maximum-urgency-first (MUF), which combines the advantages of the RM, EDF, and MLF algorithms. Like EDF and MLF, MUF has a schedulable bound of 100% for the critical set. And like RM, a critical set can be defined that is guaranteed to meet all its deadlines. The MUF algorithm also allows the sched-uler to detect three forms of deadline failures, and call failure handler routines for tasks which fail to meet their deadlines.The MUF scheduler has been implemented as the default scheduler of CHIMERA II, a real-time operating system being used to control sensor-based control systems both at Carnegie Mellon University and elsewhere. There are still many issues to be addressed with regards to the MUF algorithm. This paper also presents those issues, with possible approaches that should be investigated further.

Reference-contexts: With the RM algorithm, priority ceiling protocol [6] semaphores are often used for ensuring critical tasks still meet their deadlines in the presence of task dependencies. For the dynamic scheduling algorithms, both dynamic priority ceiling protocol semaphores <ref> [1] </ref> and resource scheduling [9] have been proposed. Adaptation of one or more of these methods to the MUF algorithm may be possible. Varying Time Constraints: In the introduction of this paper we gave an example of dynamically changing timing constraints that may be encountered in sensor-base control systems.

Reference-contexts: Because MUF is a dynamic scheduler, aperiodic events can readily be included in the system without changing the basic MUF scheduler. However, such events must not cause tasks from the critical set to fail. Several methods have been adopted with the RM algorithm, including the sporadic server <ref> [7] </ref>. Similar methods can possibly be used with the MUF algorithm. For example, an aperiodic server can be given a criticality higher than the critical set.
