Title: Utilizing Versions of Views within a Mobile Environment

Abstract: Data caching and hoarding provide the only means to support disconnected mobile operations. In the context of mobile database applications, data cached can take the form of a materialized view. In this paper, we present a mechanism or view holder within the fixed network, whose job is to maintain versions of the views that are required by a particular mobile host. These views are very likely to be a small and specialized portion of the information found within the various data sources and, therefore, versions can be dynamically maintained by the view holder without incurring huge storage requirements. In addition, the view holder will respond to mobile host's queries by communicating only the differences between versions. Thus, a view holder mediates and exports the views needed by a mobile host, and updates are computed and delivered in a flexible and batch manner.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate the problems discussed, without requiring modifications to the existing databases and data warehouses (i.e., unlike solutions presented in <ref> [BDMW95] </ref>), the mechanism we created for maintaining the materialized views requested by a mobile host is called the view holder. The goal of the view holder is to bring the data closer to the mobile hosts and control the interactions between the mobile hosts and the data sources.

A data warehouse, using a 1 The term hoarding was introduced in <ref> [KS92] </ref> to identify the state a MH is in when it is collecting useful data in anticipation of disconnection. 3 versioning maintenance algorithm, is created where the views are static and the number of consecutive versions of each view also remains static.

Each MH retains its network connection while moving by remaining in contact with special stationary hosts equipped with wireless interfaces, called the mobility support stations (MSS). Each MSS is responsible for an area called a cell.

Research in mobile computers and wireless networks is allowing them to become an integrated part of distributed computing environments along with stationary hosts and clients. Due to the communication costs, limited bandwidth, and latency of mobile networks, information stored within the mobile computer becomes crucial to maintaining productivity.
