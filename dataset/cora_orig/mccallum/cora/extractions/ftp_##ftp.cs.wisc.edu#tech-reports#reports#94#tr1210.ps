Reference-contexts: For example, results concerning L and 18 L fl matrices, which are extensions of those for copositive-plus matrices, can be found in [12] and [13] (see also [37]). Termination results on P 0 matrices, which are extensions of those for P -matrices can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and [9]. Matrix classes related to LCP are numerous ( see [37] and [8] ).

Reference-contexts: Since (CP) is equivalent to a standard monotone LCP, interior point algorithms, e.g., the path following algorithm in [29], the potential reduction algorithm in [30], and the infeasible path following algorithm in [50] and <ref> [3] </ref>, can be applied to provide polynomial algorithms for (CP) and hence for (AVI).

Reference-contexts: C is a closed convex set in IR n , is equivalent to (GE) with T = @f + N ( j C) The finite termination of (PP) is studied in [18] and [4] in conjunction with the notions of weak sharp minima and minimum principle sufficiency (see [19] and <ref> [6] </ref>). We proceed to extend some of these results to the case of general maximal monotone multifunction and show how these results can be applied to monotone variational inequalities. 5.1 Finite Termination We begin with the definition of a sharp zero set for a maximal monotone multifunc-tion.

Reference-contexts: The most extensively studied algorithm for solving LCP is Lemke's pivotal algorithm. Termination properties of this algorithm are well known on two classes of matrices, namely, copositive-plus and P (see, for example <ref> [7] </ref>). Generalizations are found throughout the LCP literature. For example, results concerning L and 18 L fl matrices, which are extensions of those for copositive-plus matrices, can be found in [12] and [13] (see also [37]).

Reference-contexts: Termination results on P 0 matrices, which are extensions of those for P -matrices can be found in [1] and [9]. Matrix classes related to LCP are numerous ( see [37] and <ref> [8] </ref> ). Here is a brief survey of those that are closely related to this work. Most of these matrix classes are defined with respect to IR n + . <p> Theorem 1.16 Every P -matrix is sufficient, and every sufficient matrix is in P 0 . Proof Every P -matrix M is column sufficient by part (b) of <ref> [8, Theorem 3.3.4] </ref>. M T is a P -matrix provided M is a P -matrix. Hence M T is column sufficient. Consequently, M is sufficient. Suppose M is column sufficient. Let 0 6= z 2 IR n . <p> In the latter case, z i (M z) i = 0 for all i. In any event, there is an index i such that z i 6= 0 and z i (M z) i 0. Hence, M is P 0 by part (b) of <ref> [8, Theorem 3.4.2] </ref>. So, every column sufficient matrix is a P 0 -matrix. Therefore, every sufficient matrix is a P 0 -matrix. Q.E.D. <p> n fi n matrix, the following are equivalent: (a) M is semi-monotone. (b) (LCP) has the unique solution 0 for all q &gt; 0. (c) For any index ff f1; 2; ; ng, the system M ffff x ff &lt; 0; x ff 0 has no solution. 22 Proof See <ref> [8, Theorem 3.9.3] </ref>. Q.E.D. It is clear from the definition that P matrices and column sufficient matrices are semi-monotone. Copositive-plus matrices and L-matrices are also semi monotone as a result of part (b) of the proceeding theorem. <p> The leaving variable is now uniquely determined by the index r. Furthermore, the updated matrix Q k+1 = B u A W k+1 AI IA W k+1 1 A will again have linearly independent, lexicographically positive rows ( see <ref> [8, pp. 340 - 342] </ref> for a proof ). We showed in the previous section that if A C was coherently oriented then following the above path gives a monotonic decrease in . <p> To see how these definitions relate to the standard ones given in the literature on linear complementarity problems (e.g. [37] and <ref> [8] </ref>), consider the case that 45 + and K = recC = IR n + . Condition a) says that LCP (q; A) has a unique solution 0 for all q &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: In this work, we focus on the special case where the map F is affine and C is 3 polyhedral. In this case, the normal map is piecewise linear and the normal equation is a piecewise linear equation. The general theory of piecewise linear equations developed by Eaves in <ref> [15] </ref> and special properties of normal maps induced by linear transformation developed by Robinson [43] are used in constructing and analyzing algorithms for solving this type of normal equation. <p> This method is a realization of the general path-following algorithm described and justified in <ref> [15] </ref>. In what follows we use various terms and concepts that are explained in [15]. Related methods for finding stationary points of affine functions on polyhedral sets are given in [16, 17]. <p> This method is a realization of the general path-following algorithm described and justified in <ref> [15] </ref>.

A more detailed description of an implementation of the method is given in the Section 2.2; here we deal with theoretical considerations underpinning the method. <p> Now construct a piecewise-linear manifold M from N C by forming the Cartesian product of each cell of N C with IR + , the non-negative half-line in IR. This M will be a PL (n + 1)-manifold in IR n+1 , as can easily be verified (see <ref> [15, Example 4.3] </ref>). <p> Now we apply the Algorithm 2 from Chapter 1 to the PL equation F (x; ) = 0, using a ray start at (w ( 1 ); 1 ) for some 1 &gt; 0 and proceeding in the direction (e; 1). As the manifold M is finite, according to <ref> [15, Th. 15.13] </ref> the algorithm generates, in finitely many steps, either a point (x fl ; fl ) in the boundary of M with F (x fl ; fl ) = 0, or a ray in F 1 (0) different from the starting ray. <p> Because we start on this ray, Y (*) cannot be homeomorphic to a circle, and therefore it is homeomorphic to an interval. A simple computation at the starting point shows that the curve index <ref> [15, x12] </ref> at that point is 1. By [15, Lemma 12.1] this index will be constant along Y (*). <p> Because we start on this ray, Y (*) cannot be homeomorphic to a circle, and therefore it is homeomorphic to an interval. A simple computation at the starting point shows that the curve index [15, x12] at that point is 1.

By [15, Lemma 12.1] this index will be constant along Y (*). However, a computation similar to that in <ref> [15, Lemma 12.3] </ref> shows that in each cell of M, if the direction of Y (*) in that cell is (r; ) then (sgn)(sgn det T ) = 1 where T is the linear transformation associated with A C in the corresponding cell of N C .

Reference-contexts: Given a monotone multifunction T we can define a complementarity problem of finding (x; y) such that (x; y) 2 T; (x; y) 0 and x T y = 0 (4.1) We call it the generalized linear complementarity problem when T is affine and maximal monotone (see <ref> [25] </ref>). 85 In Section 4.1, we will show how AVI (q; M; X) is related to a generalized linear complementarity problem and how interior point methods can be used for solving monotone affine variational inequalities. <p> In fact, by the analysis from the last section, (4.11) is equivalent to H 1 u H 2 v = 0; V u + U v = U V e e (4.12) Hence, (u; v) is uniquely solvable from (4.11) by the maximality of T ( see <ref> [25, Theorem 2.1] </ref> ). Furthermore, in view of Theorem 4.4, the step computed from (4.11) is the same as the interior step used by Kojima et.al. in [29] for LCP (C 1 D; C 1 a). Therefore we have the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the normal map is piecewise linear and the normal equation is a piecewise linear equation. The general theory of piecewise linear equations developed by Eaves in [15] and special properties of normal maps induced by linear transformation developed by Robinson <ref> [43] </ref> are used in constructing and analyzing algorithms for solving this type of normal equation. <p> Furthermore, this result ( Theorem 2.11 ) includes many of the standard existence results for complementarity problems and variational inequalities as special cases. 25 2.1 Theoretical Algorithm We describe briefly a theoretical algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution in finitely many steps when the homeomorphism condition developed in <ref> [43] </ref> holds. This method is a realization of the general path-following algorithm described and justified in [15]. In what follows we use various terms and concepts that are explained in [15]. Related methods for finding stationary points of affine functions on polyhedral sets are given in [16, 17]. <p> Other related work can be found in [5]. In order to formulate the algorithm, it is important to understand the underlying geometric structure of the problem. Our approach relies heavily on the normal manifold of the set C, <ref> [43] </ref>, which we will now describe. Theorem 2.1 Let C be a nonempty polyhedral convex set in IR n and fF i j i 2 I g be the nonempty faces of C. <p> If each of these determinants has the same sign, we say that A C is coherently oriented. The following is the central result from <ref> [43] </ref>. 26 Theorem 2.2 The normal map A C is a Lipschitzian homeomorphism of IR n into IR n if and only if A C is coherently oriented. <p> Later in the chapter, this condition will be weakened. The first step of the algorithm is to determine if C contains any lines. If it does, take orthonormal bases for lin C and its orthogonal complement according to the scheme explained in <ref> [43, Prop. 4.1] </ref>. The factoring procedure explained there shows how to reduce the problem to one (which we shall also write A C (x) = a) in a possibly smaller space, in which the set C appearing in this problem contains no lines. <p> The factoring procedure explained there shows how to reduce the problem to one (which we shall also write A C (x) = a) in a possibly smaller space, in which the set C appearing in this problem contains no lines. In that case, as shown in <ref> [43] </ref>, the determinants associated with A C in the various cells of N C must all have positive sign. Further, C will have an extreme point, say x e , and as pointed out in [43, x5] the normal cone N C (x e ) must have an interior. <p> In that case, as shown in [43], the determinants associated with A C in the various cells of N C must all have positive sign. Further, C will have an extreme point, say x e , and as pointed out in <ref> [43, x5] </ref> the normal cone N C (x e ) must have an interior. Let e be any element of intN C (x e ). An implementation of the factoring procedure is given as stage one of the method described in Section 2.2. <p> The reduced problem ~ A ~ C y = ~a (2.3) is constructed using the method outlined in <ref> [43, Proposition 4.1] </ref>, which also appear in this work as Lemma 3.1. <p> Then a) A recC is coherently oriented; b) A is an L-matrix with respect to recC. Proof a ) This follows from the proof of <ref> [43, Theorem 4.3] </ref>. b ) By the first part, A recC is coherently oriented, so by [43, Theorem 4.3] it is a Lipschitzian homeomorphism, and hence A recC (x) = q has a unique solution for all q. <p> Then a) A recC is coherently oriented; b) A is an L-matrix with respect to recC. Proof a ) This follows from the proof of <ref> [43, Theorem 4.3] </ref>. b ) By the first part, A recC is coherently oriented, so by [43, Theorem 4.3] it is a Lipschitzian homeomorphism, and hence A recC (x) = q has a unique solution for all q. Therefore part 1 and 2 of the definition of L-matrix are trivially satisfied by the unique solution 0. <p> When int recC 6= ;, the assumption that A is copositive-plus on recC will suffice. 70 71 3.1 Basic Techniques We introduce a standard form of the normal equation A C (x) = a by using a reduction procedure similar to the one described in the paper <ref> [43, Proposition 4.1] </ref>.
