Abstract: We consider the problem of belief aggregation: given a group of individual agents with probabilistic beliefs over a set of of uncertain events, formulate a sensible consensus or aggregate probability distribution over these events. Researchers have proposed many aggregation methods, although on the question of which is best the general consensus is that there is no consensus. We develop a market-based approach to this problem, where agents bet on uncertain events by buying or selling securities contingent on their outcomes. Each agent acts in the market so as to maximize expected utility at given securities prices, limited in its activity only by its own risk aversion. The equilibrium prices of goods in this market represent aggregate beliefs. For agents with constant risk aversion, we demonstrate that the aggregate probability exhibits several desirable properties, and is related to independently motivated techniques. We argue that the market-based approach provides a plausible mechanism for belief aggregation in multiagent systems, as it directly addresses self-motivated agent incentives for participation and for truthfulness, and can provide a decision-theoretic foundation for the "expert weights" often employed in centralized pooling techniques.

Nevertheless, there are common situations in which a collection of agents may wish to aggregate their beliefs.

Hanson has also described a scenario for employing a similar mechanism for coordinating computational agents <ref> [ Hanson, 1991 ] </ref> . A third popular example of market-based belief aggregation is the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) sys tem (http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/), which runs real-money markets in uncertain political and financial propositions. Their market in the US Presidential election, for example, attracted wide participation and following.

Reference-contexts: If prices are inconsistent (for example, the summed prices for a set of exhaustive events is less than one), then it is possible to identify a combination of securities that does not lose money in any possible outcome. This situation provides an opportunity for arbitrage <ref> [ Nau and McCardle, 1991 ] </ref> |the portfolio can be replicated to increase utility (1) without bound. We exhibit some examples of unbounded behavior for logically related goods below.

Reference-contexts: As an example, a group of doctors with disparate subjective beliefs evaluating the probabilities of diseases may benefit from a formal method for combining their opinions (especially if their advice is to be culled into a probabilistic expert system <ref> [ Ng and Abramson, 1992 ] </ref> ). In more general terms, as trends toward decentralization in computation continue, aggregation mechanisms are likely to play an increasing role in uncertain reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Their market in the US Presidential election, for example, attracted wide participation and following. Slate magazine even used IEM as its main index of the election "horse race". In our previous work, we defined a general mapping from Bayesian networks to computational economies <ref> [ Pennock and Wellman, 1996 ] </ref> , showing that any joint probability distribution can be expressed as the competitive equilibrium of a particular configuration of consumer and producer agents for a particular set of securities. In this model (called Market-Bayes), consumers have preferences directly over securities.
