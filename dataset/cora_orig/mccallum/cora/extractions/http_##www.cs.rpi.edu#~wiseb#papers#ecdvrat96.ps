Abstract: An architecture for a new generation of multimedia systems is presented based on the concept of metawidgets, which are collections of alternative representations for information, both within and across sensory modalities, along with user-transparent mechanisms for choosing among them. The proposed architecture allows us to overcome certain drawbacks of today's systems, where the designer typically must assign each component of the display to a specific modality in a fixed and inflexible manner. The design of the POLYMESTRA environment based on our architecture is next described in detail, with particular emphasis on the layered development approach, core software tools and inter-application communication. Finally, we discuss the current status of the implementation, and outline plans for distribution of the prototype later this year to get user feedback.

Reference-contexts: Object oriented languages may be classified on how they relate classes and objects. Single hierarchy languages, like Smalltalk and Self, treat classes and objects as essentially the same. This allows some objects to be able to create other object instances. These special factory objects are called exemplars <ref> (Coplien, 1992) </ref>. C++, which treats classes and objects as distinct entities, is a so-called dual hierarchy language. Classes are similar to abstract data types. Classes are fixed at compile time, and objects do not exist until run time.

Reference-contexts: To gain a better understanding of how to present information more effectively using several modalities, we examined a number of theories of attention, including: capacity theory, resource theory, confusions theory, and compatibility of proximity. Fracker and Wickens <ref> (Fracker and Wickens, 1989) </ref> provide an excellent discussion of these ideas; we summarize here just that work which we found most applicable to our research.

Reference-contexts: When multiple tasks are performed simultaneously they compete with one another for the limited mental resources available, which may ultimately cause performance to deteriorate. These theories have been collectively called resource theories (Kahneman, 1973; Navon and Gopher, 1979; Wickens, 1984; Wickens, 1987). Early resource theory <ref> (Kahneman, 1973) </ref> hypothesized that there is a single, undifferentiated pool of resources available to all tasks and mental activities. The available resources can be used for several tasks, provided the demands imposed by the tasks do not overly deplete the finite pool of resources.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 4 shows how the representation of a metawidget is implemented as a pointer to a BaseRepresentation. The object oriented class diagrams found in this figure and the next are patterned after Rumbaugh's Object Modeling Technique (OMT) <ref> (Rumbaugh, Blaha, Premerlani, Eddy and Lorenson, 1991) </ref>. Classes are drawn in rectangular boxes; arrowhead lines are used to denote relationships between classes. Simple arrowhead lines indicate inheritance, while arrowhead lines with a diamond at the tail denote aggregation.

Reference-contexts: Modalities and Cognitive Resources Users often run several applications simultaneously, and must absorb information from all of them. Too much (cumulative) information in a single modality leading to sensory overload is one potential problem to be overcome. Cross-modality conflicts, as when the visual dominance <ref> (Wickens, 1992) </ref> of the human perceptual system causes an auditory stimulus to be ignored, are another.
