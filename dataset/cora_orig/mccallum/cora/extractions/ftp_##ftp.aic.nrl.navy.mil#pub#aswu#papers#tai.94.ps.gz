Reference-contexts: We have proposed a detailed investigation into the effects of non-coding segments on GA performance. The first step of this research involves replicating two sets of experiments on non-coding segments. Specifically, we are concerned with the work of Levenick [5] and of Forrest and Mitchell <ref> [1] </ref>. We have rerun a set of experiments from each of these papers on our own GA program which is described in [9]. <p> Once a building block exists in the entire population, then all exploratory power can be directed towards finding the remainder of the building blocks. 4 Forrest and Mitchell's experiments Forrest and Mitchell investigated the effect of non-coding segments on the Royal Road functions <ref> [1] </ref>. The Royal Road functions [1] [2] [7] are a class of fitness landscapes designed for studying building block interactions. In these functions, all building blocks are defined and assigned fitness values before a run begins. Higher level building blocks consist of two or more lower level building blocks. <p> Once a building block exists in the entire population, then all exploratory power can be directed towards finding the remainder of the building blocks. 4 Forrest and Mitchell's experiments Forrest and Mitchell investigated the effect of non-coding segments on the Royal Road functions <ref> [1] </ref>. The Royal Road functions [1] [2] [7] are a class of fitness landscapes designed for studying building block interactions. In these functions, all building blocks are defined and assigned fitness values before a run begins. Higher level building blocks consist of two or more lower level building blocks. <p> Our program seems to magnify the differences for the extreme valued (shortest and longest) runs. Like For-rest and Mitchell, our GA performed slightly worse on when non-coding segments are added. 5 Discussion We successfully replicated the general behavior of a subset of the experiments from [5] and <ref> [1] </ref>, if not the exact data values. In the process, we show that it is important to verify both the GA program and the fitness function when replicating GA experiments. Small differences in program structure or parameter values can produce significant differences in the results.

In these functions, all building blocks are defined and assigned fitness values before a run begins. Higher level building blocks consist of two or more lower level building blocks. <p> A fitness of x, an input individual, is computed by summing the fitness values, c i , corresponding to each schemata s i of which x is an instance. schema refers to the set of all strings that contain a particular building block <ref> [2] </ref> [3]. The GA operates on individuals that are strings defined over the set f0; 1g. Schemata are strings defined over the set f0; 1; flg, where fl is the don't care character. For example, the schema 110 fl fl includes the chromosomes f11000; 11001; 11010; 11011g.

Reference-contexts: The next two columns list our results. We initially ran our program with the random number generator described in <ref> [4] </ref>. The results from these runs are listed under "Old Random". We have since implemented a new generator, copied directly from Forrest and Mitchell's random number generator. The results from the new generator are listed under "New Random".

Reference-contexts: We have proposed a detailed investigation into the effects of non-coding segments on GA performance. The first step of this research involves replicating two sets of experiments on non-coding segments. Specifically, we are concerned with the work of Levenick <ref> [5] </ref> and of Forrest and Mitchell [1]. We have rerun a set of experiments from each of these papers on our own GA program which is described in [9]. <p> Since pseu-dogenes are not expressed, they are not subject to selection pressure from the environment and accumulate mutations quickly. When a pseudogene mutates enough that its similarity to a functional gene is no longer apparent, it becomes simply non-coding inter-genic DNA. 3 Levenick's experiments Levenick <ref> [5] </ref> describes a set of experiments which indicate that separating building blocks with non-coding segments can make the GA more effective. The population individuals and their component building blocks are shown in Figure 1. Levenick compares the GA's performance on type B and C individuals in his experiments. <p> The reproduction rate indicates how much of each generation is allowed to generate offspring for the next generation. In Levenick's runs, the success rate decreases as the reproduction rate increases. In our runs, the success rate increases as the reproduction rate increases. According to <ref> [5] </ref>, the high reproduction rate runs performed poorly because the high rates increase the chance of premature convergence. We also found, however, that a number of other factors overcome or make use of this high convergence rate to benefit high reproduction rates. <p> Our program seems to magnify the differences for the extreme valued (shortest and longest) runs. Like For-rest and Mitchell, our GA performed slightly worse on when non-coding segments are added. 5 Discussion We successfully replicated the general behavior of a subset of the experiments from <ref> [5] </ref> and [1], if not the exact data values. In the process, we show that it is important to verify both the GA program and the fitness function when replicating GA experiments.

Reference-contexts: There are several types of non-coding DNA [8]. In-tergenic regions are found between genes and are not transcribed into mRNA. Some intergenic regions are thought to regulate gene expression. Intragenic regions, also called introns, are one or more segments of DNA found within genes <ref> [6] </ref>. After a gene is transcribed into mRNA, the introns are removed from the mRNA chain, and the remaining segments of mRNA, the exons, are joined together to become the protein template.

Reference-contexts: Non-coding DNA refers to DNA that does not code for any type of RNA. In eukaryotic cells, the majority of the DNA is not directly involved in protein synthesis. There are several types of non-coding DNA <ref> [8] </ref>. In-tergenic regions are found between genes and are not transcribed into mRNA. Some intergenic regions are thought to regulate gene expression. Intragenic regions, also called introns, are one or more segments of DNA found within genes [6]. <p> A pseudogene is a segment of DNA that is similar to a functional gene, but contains nucleotide changes that prevent its expression <ref> [8] </ref>. Since pseu-dogenes are not expressed, they are not subject to selection pressure from the environment and accumulate mutations quickly.

We have rerun a set of experiments from each of these papers on our own GA program which is described in <ref> [9] </ref>. This paper presents our results and discusses the similarities and differences between our data and the original data. 2 Non-coding DNA In natural systems, the DNA of a gene is copied into RNA during transcription. The synthesis of a protein from RNA is called translation.
