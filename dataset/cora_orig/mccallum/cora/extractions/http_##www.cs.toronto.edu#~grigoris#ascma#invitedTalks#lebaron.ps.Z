Abstract: Financial markets operate as a large interacting group of agents each in a constant struggle to better understand and interpret current prices and information. The complex interconnections between prices and information is probably more dramatic in financial markets than any other economic situation. Economic theory has been capable of describing many different financial equilibria, but it remains quiet on the types of dynamics that can occur while learning is still active and equilibrium is never quite obtained. Models of learning agents allow a direct attack on this problem. However, even though this approach may seem appealing at first it does come with many costs. The first of these is the modeling of the agents themselves. Boundedly rational agents can come in many forms, and an important question for theorizing is where to "set the dial" of rationality. This paper will describe some of the methods that have worked, and which directions look promising. Some methods for endogenously setting the level of rationality will be discussed. Finally, comparisons to the single agent, homogeneous belief world will be made, stressing why this is still a useful benchmark. A second issue involves the actual trading mechanisms, and this will be briefly discussed in relation to how outcomes can be affected. In closing, some of the policy questions centered on market stability and structure will be compared with certain computational issues.

Reference-contexts: Notions such as rational expectations, and market efficiency can be easily stated and tested. These concepts will be defined and stressed because they greatly impact agent design questions. The Santa Fe Artificial stock market <ref> (Arthur, Hol-land, LeBaron, Palmer & Tayler 1997) </ref> will be used as a test bed of an early era artificial stock market, and several examples will be drawn from there. The agent design in this market will be overviewed, along with how it lines up with the previously mentioned goals.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not clear which of the many possibilities is best. Financial markets suggest that wealth may be the best selection critierion, but selection could also be based on some utility measure. (These criterion may not line up with eachother as shown in <ref> (Blume & Easley 1990) </ref>). Also, the agents described here are stricly myopic. How can these be moved in the direction of infinite horizon dynamic programming agents without getting too complicated. Two other types of agent behavior remain an open question in financial markets as well, communication and experimentation.

Reference-contexts: The actual amount forecasting complexity allowed in the agents may be a cru 1 cial parameter. Allowing the agents to extend their forecast complexity if that would be beneficial is a good type of flexibility to add. (An example of this in a game theoretic setting is <ref> (Lindgren 1992) </ref>.) In many of these cases in can be shown that to stay in the rational expectations equilibrium once achieved requires very little computational power. However, reaching it from outside may induce ever more complicated rules as agents coadapt to eachother.
