Abstract: The linear-width of a graph G is defined to be the smallest integer k such that the edges of G can be arranged in a linear ordering (e 1 ; : : : ; e r ) in such a way that for every i = 1; : : :; r 1, there are at most k vertices incident to edges that belong both to fe 1 ; : : : ; e i g and to fe i+1 ; : : :; e r g. In this paper, we give a set of 57 graphs and prove that it is the set of the minimal forbidden minors for the class of graphs with linear-width at most two. Our proof also gives a linear time algorithm that either reports that a given graph has linear-width more than two or outputs an edge ordering of minimum linear-width. We further prove a structural connection between linear-width and the mixed search number which enables us to determine, for any k 1, the set acyclic forbidden minors for the class of graphs with linear-width k. Moreover, due to this connection, our algorithm can be transfered to two linear time algorithms that check whether a graph has mixed search or edge search number at most two and, if so, construct the corresponding sequences of search moves.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, given a graph parameter f that is closed under taking of minors, each value of k corresponds to a different obstruction set, i.e. ob (G [f; k]). To our knowledge, obstruction sets have been found for the following graph parameters: treewidth, for k 3 (see <ref> [1, 18, 32] </ref>), branchwidth, for k 3 (see [8]), node search number, for k 3 (see [10, 20]), and mixed search number, for k 2 (see [34]). <p> : :; l r are v-simple orderings for the graphs in D (G; v), then l = l 1 l r is a v-simple ordering of G. 2 3 An algorithm for linear-width It is easy to verify that ob (G [linear-width; 0]) = fA 1 g and ob (G <ref> [linear-width; 1] </ref>) = fC 1 ; C 3 g (graphs A 1 , C 1 and C 3 are depicted in Figure 1). Using this fact, one can easily construct 9 an algorithm that decides whether linear-width (G) 1 and, if so, outputs an edge ordering of minimum linear-width. <p> It is not hard to see that, following the machinery of the proof of Theorem 4, this edge ordering can be transformed to a mixed (edge) search in linear time. 2 5.3 The acyclic minor minimal graphs with linear-width &gt; k It is easy to verify that ob (G <ref> [ms; 1] </ref>) = fK 3 ; K 1;3 g. ob (G [ms; 2]) has been determined by Taka-hashi, Ueno, and Kajitani in [34] and consists of 36 graphs. The following lemma is an immediate corollary of Lemmata 4 and 17. Lemma 18 i. <p> The following has been proved in [33]. Theorem 6 Let k 2. A tree T is in aob (G [ms; k]) iff T is a star decomposition of three graphs in aob (G [ms; k 1]). Notice that, as aob (G <ref> [ms; 1] </ref>) = fK 1;3 g, Theorem 6 explicitly defines P a k for any k 1. The following theorem shows that aob (G [ms; k 1]) and aob (G [linear-width; k]) are not very different. Theorem 7 Let T be tree and k 1.

Reference-contexts: As there exist no general method to find the obstruction set of a graph class (see [16, 17]), the research on this topic has been oriented to the specification of the obstruction set of individual graph classes (see <ref> [2, 13, 15, 23, 26] </ref>). Clearly, given a graph parameter f that is closed under taking of minors, each value of k corresponds to a different obstruction set, i.e. ob (G [f; k]). <p> Our algorithm is based on a complete structural characterisation of the class of graphs with linear-width 2. Using this characterisation, we prove that ob (G <ref> [linear-width; 2] </ref>) consists of the 57 graphs depicted on Figures 6 and 7. Moreover, we prove that, for any k, there exists an injection from ob (G [ms; k]) to ob (G [linear-width; k]). <p> A direct consequence is that ob (G [ms; k]) can be easily determined if we know ob (G [linear-width; k]). Applying this result for the case that k = 2 we can determine ob (G <ref> [ms; 2] </ref>) and, in that way, reproduce the result of [34]. Finally, for any k, we determine all the trees in ob (G [linear-width; k]). <p> After a careful inspection, one can verify that set L 2 is a minor minimal set, i.e. no graph in L 2 is a proper minor of an other member of L 2 . Therefore, we have the following. Lemma 3 L 2 ob (G <ref> [linear-width; 2] </ref>). <p> The following theorem gives a complete structural characterisation of the class of graphs with linear-width 2. Theorem 2 L 2 is the obstruction set for the class of graphs with linear-width 2 i.e. L 2 = ob (G <ref> [linear-width; 2] </ref>) . Proof. By Lemma 3, it is enough to prove that any graph with linear-width more than 2 contains at least one of the graphs in L 2 as a minor. Suppose now that linear-width (G) &gt; 2. <p> of the proof of Theorem 4, this edge ordering can be transformed to a mixed (edge) search in linear time. 2 5.3 The acyclic minor minimal graphs with linear-width &gt; k It is easy to verify that ob (G [ms; 1]) = fK 3 ; K 1;3 g. ob (G <ref> [ms; 2] </ref>) has been determined by Taka-hashi, Ueno, and Kajitani in [34] and consists of 36 graphs. The following lemma is an immediate corollary of Lemmata 4 and 17. Lemma 18 i. No graph in ob (G [ms; k]) contains edges that are fully pendant or long. ii.

Reference-contexts: Linear-width was first mentioned by Thomas in [36] and is strongly connected with the notion of crusades introduced by Bienstock and Seymour in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper we prove that several variants of problems appearing on graph searching can be reduced to the problem of computing linear-width. In a graph searching game a graph represents a system of tunnels where an agile, fast, and invisible fugitive is resorting. <p> The first graph searching game was introduced by Breisch [9] and Parsons [27] and is the one of edge searching. Node searching appeared as a variant of edge searching and was introduced by Kirousis and Papadimitriou in [22]. Finally, mixed searching was introduced in [35] and <ref> [3] </ref> and is a natural generalisation of the two previous variants (for the formal definitions see Subsection 5.1). 2 The problem of computing es (G); ns (G); ms (G), or linear-width (G) is NP-complete (see [24, 22, 35] and Theorem 5.i of this paper). <p> In this paper we give a linear time algorithm checking if a graph has linear-width 2 and, if so, outputs an edge ordering with optimal linear-width. Moreover, we prove a structural connection between linear-width and the three search parameter we mentioned before (this connection generalises the one proved in <ref> [3] </ref>). According to this result, our algorithm can be directly modified to one that checks whether the mixed or the edge search number of a graph is at most 2. and, if so, outputs an optimal search. <p> The node (edge) search number, ns (G) (es (G)) is defined similarly to the mixed search number with the difference that an edge can be cleared only if A (B) happens. The following results were proved by Bienstock and Seymour in <ref> [3] </ref> (see also [35]). Theorem 3 For any graph G the following hold: i. If ms (G) k then there exist a monotone mixed search in G using k searchers. ii. linear-width (G) ms (G). iii. <p> Clearly, such a procedure is rather impractical because of the immense number of graphs that have to be checked. Clearly, one can make it more efficient by applying further restrictions on the graphs enumerated (for example, graphs in ob (G <ref> [linear-width; 3] </ref>) cannot have small or long vertices). These restrictions can be based on some partial characterisation of G [linear-width; k] (for the case where k = 2, such a partial characterisation could be the one of smoothness that we defined in Subsection 2.4).

On the other hand, since all of these parameters is closed under taking of minors, we know that there exist a linear algorithm checking membership in G [f; k] where f is ms, es, ns, or linear-width.

Reference-contexts: Such a linear time algorithm has been constructed for the node search number [5] (actually, the result in [5] concerns the parameter of pathwidth which is known to be equal to the node search number minus one see <ref> [21, 19, 25] </ref>). Recently, a linear algorithm, checking if a graph belongs to G [linear-width; k], was found (see [7]). Moreover, the algorithm in [7] is constructive: for any fixed k, one can construct, if exists, an optimal edge arrangement. <p> We mention that the mixed search number is equivalent with the parameter of proper-pathwidth defined by Takahashi, Ueno, and Kajitani in [33, 35]. It is also known that the node search number is equal to the pathwidth, the interval thickness, and the vertex separation number (see <ref> [21, 22, 25, 19, 12] </ref>). 5.2 The relation between linear-width and mixed search A pendant vertex is called fully pendant when it is adjacent with an almost pendant vertex. Any edge containing a fully pendant vertex is called fully pendant.

Reference-contexts: As there exist no general method to find the obstruction set of a graph class (see [16, 17]), the research on this topic has been oriented to the specification of the obstruction set of individual graph classes (see <ref> [2, 13, 15, 23, 26] </ref>). Clearly, given a graph parameter f that is closed under taking of minors, each value of k corresponds to a different obstruction set, i.e. ob (G [f; k]).

Reference-contexts: Several variations on the way the fugitive can be captured during a search, define the the parameters of the edge, node, and mixed search number of a graph (namely, es (G), ns (G), and ms (G)). The first graph searching game was introduced by Breisch [9] and Parsons <ref> [27] </ref> and is the one of edge searching. Node searching appeared as a variant of edge searching and was introduced by Kirousis and Papadimitriou in [22].

Reference-contexts: According to the result of Robertson and Seymour in their Graphs Minors series of papers (see <ref> [28] </ref> for a survey), the minor minimal elements of any graph class are finite. It follows that if a graph class G is closed under taking of minors then, for any graph G, G 2 G iff none of the graphs in ob (G) is a minor of G.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, given a graph parameter f that is closed under taking of minors, each value of k corresponds to a different obstruction set, i.e. ob (G [f; k]). To our knowledge, obstruction sets have been found for the following graph parameters: treewidth, for k 3 (see <ref> [1, 18, 32] </ref>), branchwidth, for k 3 (see [8]), node search number, for k 3 (see [10, 20]), and mixed search number, for k 2 (see [34]).

Reference-contexts: If G n is the graph occurring if we replace every edge in G with two edges in parallel, then ns (G) = ms (G n ).

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, obstruction sets have been found for the following graph parameters: treewidth, for k 3 (see [1, 18, 32]), branchwidth, for k 3 (see [8]), node search number, for k 3 (see [10, 20]), and mixed search number, for k 2 (see <ref> [34] </ref>). <p> A direct consequence is that ob (G [ms; k]) can be easily determined if we know ob (G [linear-width; k]). Applying this result for the case that k = 2 we can determine ob (G [ms; 2]) and, in that way, reproduce the result of <ref> [34] </ref>. Finally, for any k, we determine all the trees in ob (G [linear-width; k]). More specifically, we prove that, for any k, there exist a bijection between the trees in ob (G [linear-width; k]) and the trees in ob (G [ms; k]). <p> transformed to a mixed (edge) search in linear time. 2 5.3 The acyclic minor minimal graphs with linear-width &gt; k It is easy to verify that ob (G [ms; 1]) = fK 3 ; K 1;3 g. ob (G [ms; 2]) has been determined by Taka-hashi, Ueno, and Kajitani in <ref> [34] </ref> and consists of 36 graphs. The following lemma is an immediate corollary of Lemmata 4 and 17. Lemma 18 i. No graph in ob (G [ms; k]) contains edges that are fully pendant or long. ii. <p> We can now obtain ob (G [ms; k]) from M by discarding all the graphs having proper minors in M (i.e. we keep only the minor minimal elements). Using the above methodology, we can directly verify the result of <ref> [34] </ref>. One can easily see that ob (G [ms; k]) can be obtained if we apply fl 1 on the 36 underlined graphs depicted in Figures 6 and 7.

Reference-contexts: Linear-width was first mentioned by Thomas in <ref> [36] </ref> and is strongly connected with the notion of crusades introduced by Bienstock and Seymour in [3]. In this paper we prove that several variants of problems appearing on graph searching can be reduced to the problem of computing linear-width.
