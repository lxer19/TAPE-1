Reference-contexts: This position paper argues that a major thrust of any initiative to improve the state of computer security education must begin with an analysis of teaching the basics of good design and programming. For this paper, we do not consider what computer security classes per se should teach <ref> [1] </ref>. We instead focus on the role of general design and programming in developing secure systems. 2.
