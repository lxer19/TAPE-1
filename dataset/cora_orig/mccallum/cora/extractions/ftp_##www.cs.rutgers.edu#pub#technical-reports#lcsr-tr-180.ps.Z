Reference-contexts: Choosing an optimal edge threshold is always ultimately empirical, remaining a perennial open problem in machine vision <ref> [6] </ref>. Systematic determination of an optimal edge-defining threshold is not easy for several reasons, principal among which are difficulties in computing or estimating the actual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for an image due to inhomogeneities or intensity variabilities within it.

Reference-contexts: So, a fundamental approach to designing a problem solver for a large class of image analysis problems using the planning approach involves the study and formulation of the problem domain in terms of generic tasks and relationships between them <ref> [7] </ref>. The adequacy of using a planning approach in vision problems, especially biomedical image analysis problems, will not be known without a careful study and formulation of the problems and expert reasoning needed in solving these problems, which is one of major research objectives of the present work.

Reference-contexts: other related future research. 20 Chapter 2 Related Work and Literature Review 2.1 Introduction Over the past 20-25 years there have been continuously increasing efforts in developing approaches and systems for the automatic generation or composition of im age processing and interpretation processes using planning ideas either implicitly or explicitly <ref> [12, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 34, 41, 46] </ref>. These methods and related systems differ from each other in many respects but can be approximately divided into two general groups. <p> of the chapter, a brief summary is given of some of the major issues addressed by the thesis. 21 2.2 Static Generation Methods 2.2.1 Garvey's Research [1976]: An early system for the automatic generation of image analysis strategies using a planning approach was developed by Garvey in the mid 70's <ref> [12] </ref>. The system decomposed an analysis task of a composite object (a chair) within a scene (an office) into the detection of the sequence of its components (such as the seat and the back), forming a plan for the recognition of the chair-object. <p> It is, however, hoped that the work can also help improve understanding of the fundamental problem solving aspects of image interpretation by computers. * Planning approaches for image analysis, especially for the automatic generation of image analysis processes, have been used since the early 70's <ref> [12, 26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It was from this and other examples we came across in the development of a later system <ref> [13] </ref> and the initial formulation of object-centered model-based planning for image analysis and recognition was conceived. 33 As mentioned earlier, the MS lesion detection system is a highly specialized and customized program. The knowledge used by the system is hard-coded and implicitly represented.

Reference-contexts: For example, by measuring the volumetric changes of tumors in patients over a sequence of visits, the effect of a particular treatment can be more reliably assessed.

Efficient and effective segmentation of images is also a critical step in surgery or radiation therapy planning.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a method to detect such filling pixels, which represent noise and unwanted structure, so that they can be subtracted from the original histogram <ref> [15] </ref>. As the actual intensity distribution of each object of interest cannot be known a-priori for realistic problems, finding f directly can be extremely difficult.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we discuss a new systematic approach to threshold determination, and describe a new way of looking at the problem based on our experimental and analytical results <ref> [18] </ref>. In this method, the local threshold is formulated as a higher order function which has as its argument an edge-defining function. This in turn takes as its argument an edge threshold variable.

Reference-contexts: Small changes in them in terms of both volume and shape may provide critical information for evaluating the effect of clinical treatment and drug dosage. We have developed within VISIPLAN an interactive area-based evaluation tool, and have tested it for a limited number of sample 2-D images <ref> [19] </ref>. It has not used here for evaluating the plan performance on relatively large numbers of images, because it is too time-consuming, requiring careful tracing of correct region boundaries by the expert.

The power of this class of techniques lie in its ability to extract well-formed closed regions and its algorithmic simplicity for computer implementation.

Reference-contexts: same image, multiple methods may have to be combined and used in a way determined by the specific problem. 4 1.2 Motivation and Approach 1.2.1 The Dilemma of Specific versus General Systems for Image Un derstanding Over the years many systems and methods have been developed for medical image interpretation <ref> [8, 10, 24, 29, 39, 49, 50, 55, 56] </ref>. Many of these systems have been reported to work well on specific types of image analysis problems. <p> Two early representative AI planning systems which have had a strong impact on the present research are briefly examined. Preceding work at Rutgers on model-based MS lesion detection is also reviewed <ref> [24, 25] </ref>. Although that project addressed a different issue, it is closely connected to the present research. <p> directly relevant to the problems addressed in the present thesis, and therefore will not be examined. 2.5 A Direct Specific Precursor: The MS Lesion Detection System of Kapouleas [1988]: The work discussed in the present thesis has a strong connection to previous research on the model-based detection of MS lesions <ref> [24, 25] </ref> from MR images carried out at Rutgers. <p> Rosenfeld et al.[40] suggested a method that selects local thresholds from the histograms computed from the subimages. The method is, however, computationally expensive. Recently a more efficient technique for computing the threshold for each subimage was introduced by Kapouleas <ref> [25, 24] </ref>. In this method, a local threshold is obtained by averaging the intensity over the edge pixels. <p> The method can be informally justified by the fact that the boundary or edge pixels between different object regions (including the background) in the spatial image are very likely to produce discriminating features in the intensity space. The method involves the following major computational steps <ref> [24] </ref>: * compute an edge map from the entire image, * divide the image into subimages (16x16 in our case for an overall MR image of 256x256 pixels), * compute a threshold for each subimage by averaging the intensity over the edge pixels, * threshold the subimages, * group the pixels <p> These results indicate that a detailed, problem-specific analysis of edge classification and region contrast is critical in determining edge-response thresholds, their relation to region extraction, and to the success of planning image analysis processes. 4.3 Learning Edge-Defining Thresholds The local-binary thresholding method developed in <ref> [24, 25] </ref> is a very efficient thresholding based segmentation methods. Its performance however, largely depends on the choice of edge-response threshold or edge-defining threshold, in addition to the binaries and homogeneity assumptions. <p> It however also detected almost an equal number of false positive regions in almost every case. The reason for this is because the geometric model-based segmentation method used by the original MS lesion detection system <ref> [24, 25] </ref> was not incorporated in the current version of the general system.

Preceding work at Rutgers on model-based MS lesion detection is also reviewed <ref> [24, 25] </ref>. Although that project addressed a different issue, it is closely connected to the present research. <p> directly relevant to the problems addressed in the present thesis, and therefore will not be examined. 2.5 A Direct Specific Precursor: The MS Lesion Detection System of Kapouleas [1988]: The work discussed in the present thesis has a strong connection to previous research on the model-based detection of MS lesions <ref> [24, 25] </ref> from MR images carried out at Rutgers. <p> So new methods are needed to overcome these problems. In the following subsections, two recently developed thresholding methods, which to some extent can alleviate some problems of the traditional histogram-based methods, are discussed in detail. The first method of local binary thresholding was developed by Kapouleas <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> Rosenfeld et al.[40] suggested a method that selects local thresholds from the histograms computed from the subimages. The method is, however, computationally expensive. Recently a more efficient technique for computing the threshold for each subimage was introduced by Kapouleas <ref> [25, 24] </ref>. In this method, a local threshold is obtained by averaging the intensity over the edge pixels. <p> The method was successfully used for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion detection in MR human brain images, with results of testing showing high performance in extracting the brain surface from PD images, and in extracting MS lesions from T2-weighted images <ref> [25] </ref>. Figure 3.1 shows the result of applying the local-binary thresholding method to a coronal and an axial MR brain image. <p> Of course, to handle the three dimensional information from multiple slices and multiple views requires integration at various levels, as carried out, for example, in the prototype system for MS lesion detection <ref> [25] </ref>. 57 In developing a vision system for real applications, it is extremely important to understand the nature of the particular set of relevant low-level methods, and their relationships to the goals of the analysis tasks. <p> These results indicate that a detailed, problem-specific analysis of edge classification and region contrast is critical in determining edge-response thresholds, their relation to region extraction, and to the success of planning image analysis processes. 4.3 Learning Edge-Defining Thresholds The local-binary thresholding method developed in <ref> [24, 25] </ref> is a very efficient thresholding based segmentation methods. Its performance however, largely depends on the choice of edge-response threshold or edge-defining threshold, in addition to the binaries and homogeneity assumptions. <p> Then, the system can detect the suspect regions of MS lesions, if any, inside the area of white matter. In fact, this is exactly the overall strategy used by Kapouleas' MS lesion detection system <ref> [25] </ref>. The planning tasks needed for designing such a process can be 89 formulated as the orderly selection of these reference objects, which are to be detected in an order determined by the spatial relationships between them. <p> It however also detected almost an equal number of false positive regions in almost every case. The reason for this is because the geometric model-based segmentation method used by the original MS lesion detection system <ref> [24, 25] </ref> was not incorporated in the current version of the general system.

These methods and related systems differ from each other in many respects but can be approximately divided into two general groups. <p> locally, (i.e. for a given specific task, select a single method to do it), and did not address issues of automatic generation or composition of image processing and recognition processes. 2.3.4 Matsuyama et al's Research [1985-89]: The only current survey on knowledge-based composition of image analysis processes is given in <ref> [34] </ref> by Matsuyama. In this paper, several such systems developed in Japan are discussed in detail. Some of these systems generate executable image processing programs by treating the task as an automatic programming problem. <p> These problems are taken by the present thesis as basic for developing computer systems for composing image analysis processes. As referenced in their paper <ref> [34] </ref>, Matsuyama and Ozaki developed a rule-base expert system for image feature extraction called LLVE. The system is able to automatically generate an analysis process using two types of knowledge: the knowledge about expected features and processing operators, and the knowledge about how to combine the operators effectively.

Reference-contexts: Local segmentation is then carried out for each subimage, and grouping is 37 performed over the entire image. The methods applied in both cases may be simple, histogram based or more complex, and non-histogram-based approaches. 3.2.1 Non-histogram Based Thresholding Otsu proposed in <ref> [37] </ref> a method which considers thresholding as a classification problem, and uses the between-class variance as a criterion function for determining an optimal discriminant i.e. an optimal threshold value. An optimal threshold is found when the criterion function is minimized for the resulting classification or segmentation.
