Reference-contexts: as a partial function on lists; if that is done, then head (empty) fails to denote an element. (That is, head (empty) is "undefined.") One way to deal with partiality in reasoning is to use a specialized logic, for example, one with three logical values and two kinds of equality <ref> [1] </ref>. However, because all such logics either do not satisfy standard logical laws or are not compositional, such logics are subtle, and thus more difficult to use and teach [9].

Reference-contexts: This worry can be alleviated in Larch/C++ by a syntactic sugar that allows one to split the specification up into multiple cases, each with its own precondition. This sugar would allow the specification in Figure 6 to be written as in commands <ref> [4] </ref>, and have been used in the specification languages Larch/CLU [24, Section 4.1.4], and Fresco [20, 22, 21]. Besides bringing the issue of protection to the specifier's attention, this notational convenience makes it easier to automatically check that a specification is protective.

Although for LSL, and other specification languages with powerful hierarchy constructs, such a completion of the specification is impossible in general, some specification languages do have general ways to complete specifications (e.g., VDM-SL [14] and COLD <ref> [5] </ref>). Such completions usually take advantage of the fact that besides proper values, each type in a programming language can be thought of as having at least one improper value (?), which is used to model computations of that type that go into infinite loops or cause errors. <p> However, to avoid overspecification (i.e., not allowing a specified procedure to terminate normally with a proper value) such languages tend to have either a complex semantics for procedure specifications or a specialized logic. One might think that in a specification language such as VDM-SL [14] or COLD <ref> [5] </ref>, in which the specification logic does not use the underspecifi-cation approach, the concept of protection is not useful.

Reference-contexts: Our explanation of this problem reviews a recent article by C. Jones [13].

Reference-contexts: We agree with Gries and Schneider [9] that the best approach to dealing with partiality is to use underspecification. That is, one avoids specifying a value for undefined terms, but assumes that all functions are total. As a concrete example of this approach, consider the Larch Shared Language (LSL) <ref> [10, Chapter 4] </ref>, [11]. In LSL's logic, all functions are presumed to be total. That is, head (empty) denotes some element of the appropriate type, even if the user has not specified what element that term denotes. Where an LSL specification is silent, terms take on some (unspecified) value. <p> In programs, one often wants to raise (throw) an exception when some boundary condition is violated. One way to write such a specification is shown in Figure 6. In this figure, the abstract values of Table objects are taken from the sort M in the trait FiniteMap <ref> [10, p. 185] </ref>. (A part of this trait is shown in Figure 7.) Note that the operator apply is underspecified and that defined is simply another operator from the trait FiniteMap. <p> To state this condition formally, we use a variation of an idea found in the Larch Prover for proving that an operator is "converted" <ref> [10, pp. 142-4] </ref>. Let T be a trait. <p> For example, the trait factTrait 0 has fact replaced by fact 0 , but true and the boolean operators are not primed, and neither are 0, pred, and succ, because they are mentioned in the generated by clause of the trait Integer <ref> [10, p. 161] </ref>. (Operators mentioned in a generated by clause are meant to be a canonical way to describe values of a given sort; two ways to describe such values cannot both be canonical.) Similarly, if P is a term in the language of T , then let P 0 be <p> Just because a term is not completely-defined does not mean it is "bad". For example, the term choose (f1g [ f2g) is not completely-defined for the trait ChoiceSet (of <ref> [10, p. 176] </ref>). The following definition of when a procedure specification is protective says, in essence, that the precondition must be completely-defined for the used trait, and that whenever the precondition holds, then the postcondition must be completely-defined for the used trait. <p> This is done by using a converts clause, as was done in Figure 1. A converts clause says that the axioms of the trait uniquely define the operators named in the clause, "relative to the other operators in the trait" <ref> [10, p. 142] </ref>. (See the appendix for a more complete explanation of conversion.) Unfortunately, proving that an LSL operator is converted does not mean it is completely-defined; it may still be underspecified. For example, consider the trait in Figure 9. <p> The concept of an exact term is based on an extension to LSL that allows one to specify which terms are not intended to be underspecified. This extension to LSL provides better documentation and allows enhanced debugging (in the sense of [6] <ref> [10, Chapter 7] </ref>) of LSL specifications. Although, for concreteness, these ideas have been presented in the context of Larch, they could be adapted to other formal specification languages that use underspecification.

Reference-contexts: Thus when specifying the mathematical operators, one need not be as careful as Gries and Schneider. To make these ideas concrete, we consider the Larch family of behavioral interface specification languages (BISLs) <ref> [12, 24, 23] </ref>. In the Larch family, one specifies implementations in two tiers by describing: * mathematical vocabulary in LSL, and * syntactic interfaces (names, types, number of arguments, etc.), and behavior (pre- and postconditions) in a BISL.

Reference-contexts: Our explanation of this problem reviews a recent article by C. Jones <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> More importantly, classical logic matches informal reasoning. 1.2 Jones's Examples Recently, Jones presented some "counter examples" to logics like LSL's, which use underspecification to deal with partiality <ref> [13] </ref>. We use these examples to explain LSL, underspecification, and the problem we are solving. We translate Jones's first example into the LSL trait shown in Figure 1. This trait defines a sort, OneElem, a constant it, and a function f. <p> This trait defines a sort, OneElem, a constant it, and a function f. Because of the generated by clause, the sort OneElem has only one element, the constant it. (The current version of LSL allows such sorts, contrary to <ref> [13] </ref>.) In LSL f (-1) = it, because f has to take on some value when applied to -1, and the only possible value is it. <p> Using separate tiers for the specification of mathematical operators and procedure implementations allows procedure specifications to protect implementations from dependence on underspecified mathematical operators. Thus the Larch approach mitigates the problems Jones warned about <ref> [13] </ref>. Our technical results are summarized in Table 1. The main concept is when a BISL procedure specification is protective, in the sense that it does not force implementations to satisfy unintended consequences of an LSL trait.

Reference-contexts: such as fact (-1), which are prohibited by the generated by clause in the LSL Integer trait.) Although for LSL, and other specification languages with powerful hierarchy constructs, such a completion of the specification is impossible in general, some specification languages do have general ways to complete specifications (e.g., VDM-SL <ref> [14] </ref> and COLD [5]). <p> However, to avoid overspecification (i.e., not allowing a specified procedure to terminate normally with a proper value) such languages tend to have either a complex semantics for procedure specifications or a specialized logic. One might think that in a specification language such as VDM-SL <ref> [14] </ref> or COLD [5], in which the specification logic does not use the underspecifi-cation approach, the concept of protection is not useful.

Reference-contexts: An example of how this idea can be used informally is given in Figure 4, which specifies an integer-valued factorial procedure, which is to be implemented in C++. The informal pre- and postconditions follow requires and ensures, respectively. (The keyword informally in Larch/C++ <ref> [15] </ref> signals the start of an informal predicate.) In this specification the precondition requires that the argument x has a well-defined factorial.

Reference-contexts: Thus we advocate: * the separation of an implementation's specification into two tiers, and * redundant ways of specifying what is intended to be completely-defined (or underspecified). The separation of a specification into two tiers can be used even in informal contexts <ref> [16] </ref> to guard against the problems Jones warns about. The redundant ways of specifying intent can be used to debug and check formal specifications to further guard against this problem.

Reference-contexts: Protection is also a useful concept when coupled with executable specifications. In a language like Eiffel <ref> [17] </ref>, having a precondition be flagged as false helps debugging more than having an error occur in the body of a procedure or an executable postcondition. 6 Summary In this paper we have shown that the Larch approach to behavioral interface specification has significant advantages in avoiding potential problems caused by

Reference-contexts: Since such specifications would be less dependent on the logical details, we believe that they would be clearer. In PVS <ref> [18] </ref>, the logic uses total functions, but each function has a domain that is precisely defined using a predicate. Our use of exact clauses is similar, but allows one to say what terms are intended to be completely-defined, not just what the domain of an operator is.

Reference-contexts: In PVS an attempt to apply a mathematical operator outside its domain would be a type error. If PVS were used as the mathematical basis for a BISL, then one would be forced to write protective specifications in order to prevent type errors in post-conditions. For Z <ref> [19] </ref>, it seems that the draft standard has adopted the underspecifi-cation approach [26].
