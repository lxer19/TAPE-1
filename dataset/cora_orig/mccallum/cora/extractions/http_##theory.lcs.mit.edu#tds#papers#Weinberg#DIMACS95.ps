Title: Verification of Automated Vehicle Protection Systems (extended abstract)  
Author: H.B. Weinberg Nancy Lynch Norman Delisle 
Abstract: We apply specification and verification techniques based on the timed I/O automaton model of Lynch and Vaandrager to a case study in the area of automated transit. The case study models and verifies selected safety properties for automated Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) systems such as PRT 2000 TM , a system currently being developed at Raytheon. Due to their safety critical nature, PRT 2000 TM and many other automated transit systems divide the control architecture into operation and protection subsystems. The operation system handles the normal control of vehicles. The protection system maintains safety by monitoring and possibly taking infrequent but decisive action. In this work, we present both a high-level treatment of a generic protection system and more detailed examinations of protection systems that enforce speed limits and vehicle separation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper presents a case study in the application of formal methods from computer science to the modeling and verification of hybrid systems. Our group's work is based on the Lynch-Vaandrager timed I/O automaton model <ref> [1] </ref> and uses a combination of several representation and verification methods. This is the second in a series of case studies undertaken by our group that focus on automated transit systems.

Reference-contexts: This is the second in a series of case studies undertaken by our group that focus on automated transit systems. An overview of our methods, the series of case studies, and our group's long term goals appears in this volume <ref> [2] </ref>. In the process of conducting these case studies, we extended the timed I/O automaton model to allow the precise description of continuous behavior. We call these extensions the hybrid I/O automaton model; a complete formal definition of this model appears in this volume [3].
