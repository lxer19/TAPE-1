Abstract: Rational curves and splines are one of the building blocks of computer graphics and geometric modeling. Although a rational curve is more flexible than its polynomial counterpart, many properties of polynomial curves are not applicable to it. For this reason it is very useful to know if a curve presented as a rational space curve has a polynomial parametrization. In this paper, we present an algorithm to decide if a polynomial parametrization exists, and to compute the parametrization. In algebraic geometry it is known that a rational algebraic curve is polynomially parametriz-able iff it has one place at infinity. This criterion has been used in earlier methods to test polynomial parametrizability of algebraic plane curves. The resulting algorithm is complicated and also requires that the parametric curves be implicitized. This causes problem for rational space curves. In this paper we give a simple condition which is both necessary and sufficient for polynomial parametrizability of rational space curves. The calculation of the polynomial parametrization is simple, and involves only a rational reparametrization of the curve.

Reference-contexts: The criterion for determining whether a rational algebraic curve has a polynomial parametrization, namely that it has only one place at infinity, is well defined and used on rational plane algebraic curves <ref> [Ab88] </ref>. The algorithm makes use of g-adic expansions and Newton polygons [Wa50] and is quite complicated. <p> In particular, the curve has two or more places at a node or loop and one place at a cusp. More on places and their representation as branches is given in <ref> [Ab88; Ho89; SK59] </ref>. A rational parametric space curve Q (t) is properly parametrized if it has one-to-one relationship between the parameter t and points on the curve, except for a finite number of exceptional points. Let S be one of these exceptional points (not every curve consists of such points). <p> II The criterion for determining whether a rational algebraic curve has a polynomial parametrization has been defined in terms of the number of places the curve has at infinity <ref> [Ab88] </ref>. Theorem II A curve has a polynomial parametrization if and only if the curve has one place at infinity and it can be parametrized by rational functions. The curve has at least one place corresponding to every point.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, there can be more than one homogeneous representation for a rational curve. These different representations are obtained in many applications, e.g. degree elevation algorithms for Bezier curves. The conditions for the continuity of rational curves are more general than those of polynomial curves <ref> [HB89] </ref>. As a result concatenation may not be possible between rational B-spline curves even when they have the requisite continuity, because they do not have that continuity in the higher dimensional space.

More details on affine and projective spaces are given in <ref> [Ho89; SK59; Wa50] </ref>. <p> The formal power series or the local parametrization is called a place of Q (t) at P and exists because of Newton's theorem <ref> [SK59] </ref>. The notion of a place is more specific than that of a curve point. Corresponding to every curve point the curve has a place. The curve may have more than one place at a singular point and has one place at every non-singular point. <p> In particular, the curve has two or more places at a node or loop and one place at a cusp.

Let S be one of these exceptional points (not every curve consists of such points). <p> At such points, the curve has more than one place. The exact relationship between the number of parameter values corresponding to a point and the number of places at the same point is given by the following theorem <ref> [SK59] </ref>: Theorem I The number of values of t that give rise to a point P on a properly parametrized curve Q (t) is the number of places on the curve at P.

As far as rational space curves are concerned, a necessary criterion is obtained by projecting it to a plane and testing the resulting plane curve for polynomial parametrizability.
