Reference-contexts: It includes selected manuscript data as well as digital data. A thick document is available; a searchable floppy disk version is expected in mid 1990. Other approaches to the on-line discovery and access to databases can be found in <ref> [BURT89, COTT86, WILL86] </ref>. NASA took on the task of developing a National Master Directory for the U.S. about 1987. (Sometimes it is called the NASA directory.) Under this program (for the broad spectrum of Global Change research), descriptions of datasets and data centers can be searched on-line.

Reference-contexts: This expertise is analogous to the kind of editorial expertise available to the Scientific American. (5) Standards of an appropriate description, and an appropriate lexicon should be evolutionary and discipline specific. But we should standardize the form of descriptions. As an example, <ref> [GROS88] </ref> describes protocols for producing extensions to the FITS standards, not actual extensions them selves.

Reference-contexts: While standards may be important, it was noted that they should not be imposed "from above". (This would seem to contradict the conclusion in <ref> [NATI88] </ref> p.85.) Many of the best standards evolve through usage. In particular, it was observed that standards should not be arbitrarily imposed from above by federal agencies.

Reference-contexts: There are some standards in some disciplines (often in small user groups within a discipline). Most are evolving standards, such as FITS <ref> [WELL81] </ref>. Few layout standards are cross-disciplinary. This is important for archival storage, as well as for transport. Investigation of ASN.1 (Abstract Standard Notation-1) and a variety of intra-disciplinary approaches is a priority. (2) Internal structure: A dictionary of relational schema is a description of internal structure. It is DBMS specific.
