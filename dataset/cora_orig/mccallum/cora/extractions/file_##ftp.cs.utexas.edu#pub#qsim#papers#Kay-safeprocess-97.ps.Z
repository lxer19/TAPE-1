Abstract: While model-based process monitoring and system identification share the common goal of describing the behavior of a physical system based on a mathematical model, the assumptions made by system identification are typically too strong to apply it directly to monitoring problems. This article describes SQUID, a new system identification method that uses refutation rather than search to identify a model of a physical system. By ruling out implausible models rather than searching for the best model that fits the data, SQUID is more robust in the face of uninformative data and structural model uncertainty than are traditional identification methods.

Reference-contexts: Typical system identification methods for state-space modeling describe model spaces with parametric ODE models (Ljung, 1987). The refinement operator consists of a parameter estimation method (which generates an estimate and bound for each parameter) and a validation method that determines if the refined model is acceptable. Model-based monitoring <ref> (Dvorak and Kuipers, 1989) </ref> can also be viewed in terms of a model selector (the hypothesis generator, which selects a model space) and a refinement operator (the tracker, which simulates the fault model and matches it to the observation stream thus reducing the model space). <p> These two features make SQUID a good candidate for use in a monitoring system since uninformative data and structural uncertainty under faults are common. SQUID shares with the MIMIC <ref> (Dvorak and Kuipers, 1989) </ref> and TrenDx (Haimowitz, 1994) systems the idea that model-based tracking and matching of observations to predictions is an effective method for monitoring. It's focus, however, is on methods for tracking rather than on methods for selecting among possible fault hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, gradient estimates are more error-prone since they must be calculated using finite differences. While there are existing identification-based monitoring systems (see <ref> (Isermann, 1984) </ref>), they assume that these difficulties are not present. SQUID overcomes these difficulties in two ways. By using a more descriptive model representation that includes both parametric and structural uncertainty, it can provide better coverage of faults.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows the representation of a simple one-tank system with a constant inflow. Note that the SQDE can represent a single ODE system by restricting the width of landmark intervals and static envelopes to zero. The SQDE therefore covers a space of ODE systems. The SQsim simulator <ref> (Kay, 1996) </ref> generates a trajectory space in the form of SQ behaviors from an SQDE and initial condition. An SQ behavior consists of three components: * The qualitative trajectory describes the shape of the behavior in terms of regions of monotonic behavior with respect to time.

Reference-contexts: This description is produced by the Nsim <ref> (Kay and Kuipers, 1993) </ref> simulator which forms an ODE system whose behavior is guaranteed to bound all behaviors of ODEs covered by the SQDE. <p> The qualitative filter partitions the data into an extremum (box) and the surrounding monotonic regions which are then bounded using MSQUID. * The extent of events is determined by bounding the extrema detected by the qualitative filter. * The dynamic envelope for each monotonic region is defined by using MSQUID <ref> (Kay and Ungar, 1993) </ref>, a neural-network function approximator that derives an estimate and bounds on monotonic data. 3.2 Mapping SQ Trends to SQ Behaviors Once the SQ trend of the measurement stream has been computed, it can be mapped to the SQ behavior generated from the SQDE by SQsim.

Reference-contexts: Moving downward specifies more information, thus reducing the size of the model space. the value and time of an extremum) by providing interval bounds on the value and time of the event. This description is produced by using the Q2 interval propagator <ref> (Kuipers and Berleant, 1988) </ref>, which propagates the ranges associated with events through the SDE portion of the SQDE. * The dynamic envelopes define the overall bounds of the trajectory of the system with a pair of functions that bound all trajectories of the system.
