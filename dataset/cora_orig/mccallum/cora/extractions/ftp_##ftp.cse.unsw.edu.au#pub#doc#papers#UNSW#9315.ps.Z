Reference-contexts: In this paper we report on the first use of two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations for the optimization of the front finger spacing of one-sun high-efficiency Si solar cells of realistic dimensions. In the past, 2D simulations of silicon solar cells have been undertaken, e.g. by Gray et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, using SCAP2D, and Ghannam et al. [5], using Pisces. However, a comprehensive treatment of 2D effects in high-efficiency Si solar cells has not yet been published.

Reference-contexts: At UNSW, we have started a project aiming at an improved understanding of the operating conditions of these devices by using two- and three-dimensional numerical modelling. The recently developed device simulation package Simul <ref> [6] </ref> from ETH-Zurich is well-suited to such investigations. Simul uses a grid generator that provides precise control over 1 the grid density while avoiding certain numerical problems resulting from meshes containing obtuse triangles [7].

The package has recently been extended to photovoltaic applications by the inclusion of optical generation [8] and is particularly suited to the simulation of large-area devices such as solar cells.

Reference-contexts: Further losses in real devices arise from recombination losses (bulk, surfaces, metal contacts), shading losses at the metal contacts, reflection losses, and resistive losses (semiconductor and contacts). These limit the cell efficiency to the above-mentioned value of about 29 % under one-sun illumination <ref> [9, 10, 11] </ref>. In the case of conventional n + p solar cells (i.e. cells with bifacial metal contacts and a full-area current-collecting n + emitter along the illuminated front surface) the front electrode consists of a comb-like metal grid.

Reference-contexts: The most sophisticated modelling approach based on one-dimensional (1D) theory is schematically shown in Fig. 3 <ref> [12] </ref>. The solar cell is modelled by two separate diodes, an illuminated and a dark one.

Reference-contexts: The models oS (oldSlotboom), S (Slotboom), dA (delAlamo), and BW (Bennett-Wilson) are as implemented in Simul using default parameters, BW* is the BW model modified to yield a value of n i = 1:0 fi 10 10 cm 3 , which is the value currently accepted in the photovoltaic community <ref> [13] </ref>. The computed cell output shows similar sensitivities to other models determining the minority carrier concentration, in particular recombination models. It is obvious that under these circumstances a comparison of simulated and measured cell efficiencies is rather problematic.

Reference-contexts: With increasing light intensity, due to the larger lateral emitter currents, the 2D effects in the base become more pronounced. We have shown elsewhere <ref> [15] </ref> that this leads to an increasing discrepancy between 1D and 2D results. 5 Conclusions and Future Work The 2D simulations presented in this paper show that current flow in conventional high-efficiency Si solar cells deviates strongly from what is assumed by 1D models.
