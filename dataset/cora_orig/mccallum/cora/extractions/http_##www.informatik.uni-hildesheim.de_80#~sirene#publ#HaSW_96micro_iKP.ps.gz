Abstract: Micro-payments are payments too small in amount to warrant the overhead costs of current financial clearing networks. Furthermore one can expect that content servers for the global information infrastructure (GII) will have to process so many of these low value transactions that computationally complex and costly cryptographic protocols will be impractical. This report proposes a micro-payment scheme that can be bootstrapped with the already well-known payment protocols for larger amounts, but does not depend on them for each micro-transaction. Special attention is given to its integration into IBM's

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Micro-payments have a broad application area in the marketing of information distributed in an electronic form. Modern network information browsing tools (WWW <ref> [1] </ref>) enable users/clients to wander arbitrarily through the global networks and obtain such documents. We assume that a specific client normally is consuming enough low-value documents from a given server that all these low-value transactions can be accumulated in one regular payment transaction with a normal amount.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we propose a computationally cheap but nevertheless secure and non-repudiable micro-payment scheme which is bootstrapped on payment protocols for larger amounts. A concrete proposal is based on the Internet Keyed Payments Protocol (iKP) <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and its extension for a split of authorization and clearance. In the next section, we cite previous work dealing with micro-payments and discuss the additional mechanism based on secure digest functions. In Section 2 we outline the fundamental architectural types of micro-payments. <p> In fact, our application can be described as using Winternitz signatures to sign each micro-payment, and to authenticate the public key of the Winternitz signatures (i.e., A n ) like the amount of a payment. 3 3 Market Patterns The general market model assumed here is the one of iKP <ref> [2] </ref> with a buyer (B), a seller (S), and the existing financial networks subsumed under the notion of an acquirer (-gateway) (A); see Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The latter architecture, subsequently described, contains a "coupon" mechanism that is the core around which our micro-payment system was built. 2.1 Software-Only Architectures The main two existing proposals for online micro-payments are the NetBill Security and Transaction Protocol <ref> [4] </ref> and Millicent [5]. They all conclude that digital signatures are not affordable and that the repudiable security of shared keys and secure digest functions for Message Authentication Codes (MAC) is sufficient in light of the small monetary sums at stake.

Its main achievement is to simplify the monetary relations and to avoid situations where the buyer obtains change or wants to redeem coupons as in Millicent <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Fast payment plus accumulation at the seller's site would make them very attractive for micro-payments. The main disadvantage is that buyer and seller would need additional hardware. In an electronic purse scheme each micro-payment would be a complete payment. Another approach was taken by the CAFE payment system <ref> [6] </ref>. CAFE is also based on tamper-resistant hardware at the buyer's site but uses digital signatures and 2 provides a high degree of anonymity for payments. Micro-payments are considered in CAFE only for the special application of phone calls where the problem is to pay connection costs tick-by-tick.

Reference-contexts: Micro-payments are considered in CAFE only for the special application of phone calls where the problem is to pay connection costs tick-by-tick. The trick applied in CAFE is the same we use in the following (see Section 2.3), namely, bootstrapping a Winternitz signature and performing micro-payments by revealing pre-images <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.3 Basic Construction Our construction for repeated micro-payments is based on a computationally secure one-way function f. Informally, a function is one-way if it is difficult to find a value X for an image Y randomly chosen from the range of f. <p> In 1981, Lamport applied the idea to the problem of dynamic passwords [11] and most recently Pedersen applied the Winternitz idea to micro-payments <ref> [7] </ref>; as mentioned above the scheme is part of the CAFE payment system. Independent from our work two other groups came up with very similar schemes [12, 13].

Reference-contexts: Informally, a function is one-way if it is difficult to find a value X for an image Y randomly chosen from the range of f. In fact, we go a bit further and require that f is even one-way on its iterations. Good practical candidates for f are MD5 <ref> [8] </ref> or SHA [9]. Given such a one-way function f, the buyer will randomly choose a value X and will recursively compute 1. A 0 (X) = X We call the values A 0 ; :::; A n1 coupons.

Reference-contexts: However, this shows only the fact that the buyer wanted to pay something, but not what he wanted to pay for. Several applications of this idea are known: In the early 80's, Winternitz suggested that chains of coupons can be used to implement efficient one-time signatures 1 <ref> [10] </ref>. In 1981, Lamport applied the idea to the problem of dynamic passwords [11] and most recently Pedersen applied the Winternitz idea to micro-payments [7]; as mentioned above the scheme is part of the CAFE payment system.

Reference-contexts: We call such an exact document specifier (e.g a URL <ref> [14] </ref> for the World Wide Web) a micro-DESC. The delivery policy is likely to consist of an obligation of the seller to retransmit 4 a micro-product so many times until a buyer acknowledges the receipt.

Reference-contexts: The broker would first collect the payment from the buyer and would forward it to the seller only when the seller delivers the good (see <ref> [16] </ref> on how one might implement it).
