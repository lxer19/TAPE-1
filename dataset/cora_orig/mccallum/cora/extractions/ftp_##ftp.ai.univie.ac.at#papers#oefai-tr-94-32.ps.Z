Abstract: This paper presents the application of Case-Based Reasoning methods to the KOSIMO data base of international conflicts. A Case-Based Reasoning tool - VIE-CBR has been deveolped and used for the classification of various outcome variables, like political, military, and territorial outcome, solution modalities, and conflict intensity. In addition, the case retrieval algorithms are presented as an interactive, user-modifiable tool for intelli gently searching the conflict data base for precedent cases.

Reference-contexts: Thus the similarity of two symbols s a and s b is sim (s a ; s b ) = 1 ifs a = s b 0 otherwise (3) (In <ref> (Cost & Salzberg, 1993) </ref> and (Biberman, 1994) alternative definitions for nominal scaled values are defined.) Symbol-Hierarchy: Fields of this type also contain symbols, but the semantics of the symbols can be arranged in an abstraction hierarchy. <p> Simulated annealing might be used to adjust randomly selected attribute weights and assess the adjustment by performing classification on the training set. Adjustments that increase the performance are kept. A similar technique is used in the nearest-neighbor algorithm of PEBLS <ref> (Cost & Salzberg, 1993) </ref> 2. For each classification step in the training set, analyze the similarities between each pair of corresponding attribute values. If the classification was correct, increase the weight of similar attributes and decrease the weights of differing attributes.

Reference-contexts: The NOPUTSCH table contains the most detailled and accurate information of these tables. The database is an attempt to unify and extend case lists and databases of several previous research projects: primarily (Butterworth, 1976; Brecher et al., 1988; Wilkenfeld et al., 1988), but also <ref> (Gantzel & Meyer-Stamer, 1986) </ref>, (Holsti, 1983), and others. There is also a thorough textual description of all cases in the NOPUTSCH table available in (Pfetsch, 1991). Moreover, (Pfetsch & Billing, 1994) contains various statistical analyses of the data.

Reference-contexts: Several formal methods that make use of this assumption have been developed in the context of statistics and AI. Case Based Reasoning (CBR) (Kolodner, 1993) is one of these methods.

This paper presents a selection of CBR methods 1 we used (section 3) and their application to the KOSIMO 2 data base of international conflicts and wars.

Reference-contexts: We chose the KOSIMO database, because it seemed to be the one of the available data bases that was best suited for CBR methods and because textual narratives <ref> (Pfetsch, 1991) </ref> are available for all cases in the data base. <p> There is also a thorough textual description of all cases in the NOPUTSCH table available in <ref> (Pfetsch, 1991) </ref>.

In this paper, we will use the term KOSIMO database to refer to the NOPUTSCH table.

Reference-contexts: the fields could not be determined * The list is definitely empty With the KOSIMO database, it is not possible to distinguish between these possible alternatives. 2.2 Conversion of the Database We planned to use the information in the database for two purposes: experiments with inductive learning algorithms like C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref>, and experiments with Case Based Reasoning methods. Since we planned to abstract from the exact case at hand, information about the parties involved was not of primary interest.

Reference-contexts: One step into this direction seems to be the SHERFACS database <ref> (Sherman, 1994) </ref>. This data base uses a tree structure to describe the sequence of events taking place in each phase of a conflict. Case Based Methods Case-Based methods like those we have presented in this paper emphasize the importance of past cases for the classification and explanation of new cases.

Reference-contexts: This table would have seperate rows for each combination of state/instrument that occurs for a specific case. Conventional feature vector-oriented programs cannot easily deal with list-valued fields. Most ID3-like inductive learning programs, for instance, require attributes to have exactly one value (an exception is the I2D algorithm <ref> (Unseld & Mallery, 1993) </ref>).
