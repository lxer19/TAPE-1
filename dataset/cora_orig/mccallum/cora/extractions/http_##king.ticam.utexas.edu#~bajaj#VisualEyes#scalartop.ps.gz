Abstract: Scalar fields arise in every scientific application. Existing scalar visualization techniques require that the user infer the global scalar structure from what is frequently an insufficient display of information. We present a visualization technique which numerically detects the structure at all scales, removing from the user the responsibility of extracting information implicit in the data, and presenting the structure explicitly for analysis. We further demonstrate how scalar topology detection proves useful for correct visualization and image processing applications such as image co-registration, isocontouring, and mesh compression.

Reference-contexts: Globus, et. al. describe a software system for 3d vector topology and briefly note that the technique may also be applied to the gradient of a scalar field in order to identify maxima and minima [12]. Bader examines the gradient field of the charge density in a molecular system <ref> [1] </ref>. The topology of this scalar field represents the bonds linking together the atoms of the molecule. Bader goes on to show how features higher level structures in the topology represent chains, rings, an cages in the molecule.

Reference-contexts: Critical points in the scalar field are not removed, and the number introduced is kept small. We could satisfy the first two properties by computing derivatives by a method such as central differencing, which would uniquely define a C 1 continuous bi-cubic scalar interpolant <ref> [2] </ref>. However, such a choice of interpolant is likely to violate our third requirement by introducing critical points, as illustrated for the 1-D case in figure 2. To address this problem, we use a "damped" central differencing scheme as described in the following sections. <p> For further information on smooth surface representations and for modeling scalar fields, see for example <ref> [14, 2] </ref>.

Histogram equalization is a technique which spreads the data evenly over the range of colors, using the available color space to it's fullest [24]. The result is that each color in the colormap is used an equal number of times.

Reference-contexts: We will use for comparison one technique from each of these categories, isocontouring and colormapping. Isocontours, or constant valued curves and surfaces from continuous 2D and 3D scalar fields, are a common visualization technique for displaying scalar field structure <ref> [17] </ref>. By their definition, isocontours represent the data only at discrete levels, and as such are an effective technique for determining the "shape" of objects in the scalar field. <p> Animation draws attention to fuzzy details in the data which may not be detected in the static representation. There has been several papers in detecting isocontours in 2d and 3d scalar data <ref> [17, 26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Shape extraction as defined by isocontours is well understood and appreciated in many applications, such as Medical Imaging, as isocontours in a density field may result in realistic models of skeletal structure, skin surface, or various organs <ref> [18] </ref>. Also implicit in their definition is the fact that isocontours are an incomplete representation of the scalar field, as one can only infer from a isocontour that the data to one side is above the isovalue, and the data to the other side is below the isovalue.

Reference-contexts: Through detection of all critical points (saddles, maxima, and minima), we construct a graph by computing critical curves in the gradient field from saddle points to an attached critical point, as illustrated in figure 1. Curves in this topological graph are always perpendicular to isocontours of the scalar field <ref> [19] </ref>, and we will demonstrate that these curves contain complementary information to that provided by display of isocontours or colormapped scalar fields, providing a method which is both useful in its own right and which also enhances the commonly used techniques for visualizing scalar fields. <p> partial derivative in three variables = = Similar sets of linear constraint equations are examined and resolved for the higher order partials in 3D and higher, as illustrated in figure 6. 3.2 Computing Critical Points Critical points of a scalar function are defined as points at which the gradient vanishes <ref> [19] </ref>. For a bicubic function (2D) or tricubic function (3D), computing the positions of critical points amounts to solving a non-linear system of equations. However, due to the special construction of our interpolant, we have knowledge about where the critical points will occur, and can compute them quite efficiently.
