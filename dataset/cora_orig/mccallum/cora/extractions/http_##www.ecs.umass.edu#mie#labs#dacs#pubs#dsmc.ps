Abstract: An important step in Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) design is the translation of closed-loop performance specifications into QFT bounds . These bounds, domains in a Nichols chart, serve as a guide for shaping the nominal loop response. Traditionally, QFT practitioners relied on manual manipulations of plant templates on Nichols charts to construct such bounds, a tedious process which has recently been replaced with numerical algorithms. However, since the plant template is approximated by a finite number of points, the QFT bound computation grows exponentially with the fineness of the plant template approximation. As a result, the designer is forced to choose between a coarse approximation to lessen the computational burden and a finer one to obtain more accurate QFT bounds. To help mitigate this tradeoff, this paper introduces a new algorithm to more efficiently compute QFT bounds. Examples are given to illustrate the numerical efficiency of this new algorithm.

Reference-contexts: An additional reduction in the number of quadratic inequalities can be expected due to the fact that the plant template boundary may not be entirely mapped into polytope vertices; see Barmish <ref> (1994, pg. 142) </ref> for an explanation for this fact and Example 2 below for an illustration. A modified algorithm for computing QFT bounds utilizing Theorem 1 is described by: Algorithm 2 1. Establish a frequency grid W + R and a controller phase grid Q [0,2 p ). 2.

Reference-contexts: Repeat 3 until Q is emptied. 6. Evaluate w from w q , 7. Repeat 2-6 until W is emptied. The main result of this paper gives a new algorithm for computing w . It exploits the real root version of the Edge Theorem <ref> (Bartlett et al., 1988) </ref> in Step 4b to reduce the number of points in ~ w that need to be evaluated. Before getting to this algorithm we briefly present some notions on convex sets which are necessary in explaining the Edge Theorem and the modification to Algorithm 1. 3. <p> The real root version of the Edge Theorem states that the real root set of a polytope of polynomials is equal to the real root set of the edges <ref> (Bartlett et al. 1988) </ref>; i.e., [ ] [ ] s s We are now in a position to describe a new algorithm for computing QFT bounds. 4.

Reference-contexts: This follows from an application of the Maximum Modulus Theorem <ref> (Chait et al., 1995) </ref>. As a consequence, it is important that the approximation ~ w is formed from only from w . The interior of w does not contribute towards the QFT bound and only increases the computational load.

Reference-contexts: In Wang et al. (1991), quadratic inequalities are introduced to compute QFT bounds for closed-loop specifications involving gain-phase margins, sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions. While they have been used by various researchers in limited contexts <ref> (e.g., Jayasuriya, 1990, Nordgren, et al., 1995) </ref>, Chait and Yaniv (1993), Yaniv and Chait (1993), and Chait et al. (1995), developed quadratic inequalities for general settings including continuous and discrete-time systems, as well as for parametric and non-parametric uncertainty models.
