Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In languages like High Performance Fortran (HPF) for distributed memory multicomputers, array redistribution is one of the most expensive communication patterns. Array redistribution is particularly important for applications where the parallelism alternates between dimensions of the data, as in the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method <ref> [2] </ref> for partial differential equations. Even when redistribution isn't apparent, some communication patterns are equivalent to redistribution [1].
