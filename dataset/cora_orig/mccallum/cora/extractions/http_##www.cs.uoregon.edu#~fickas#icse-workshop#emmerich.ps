Abstract: Software engineering standards determine practices that `compliant' software processes shall follow. Standards generally define practices in terms of constraints that must hold for documents or the information in these documents. The document types identified by standards include not only typical development products, such as user requirements, but also process-oriented documents, such as progress reviews and management reports. The degree of standards compliance can be established by checking these documents against the constraints. It is is neither practical nor desirable to enforce compliance at all points in the development process, thus compliance must be managed rather than imposed. In this paper we define a model of standards and compliance. We then outline a lightweight implementation of the model built on a generic document management system. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our work for process modelling and the management of inconsistent information.

Reference-contexts: More narrowly we can think of this as consistency between the actual development process and the normative models embedded in the standard. Existing, well established standards, such as ISO 12207 <ref> [ISO/IEC, 1995] </ref> and PSS05 [Mazza et al., 1994] set down the properties that both the process and the product must possess at given points in the development. Such standards are both large and complex, they are often incomplete and ambiguous.

Reference-contexts: Visualising compliance opens some potentially interesting research issues. We would hope that the ideas on which our work is based can be fed back into the standards process itself and might assist in the formulation of new systems engineering standards, for example we are working on <ref> [ISO/IEC, 1997] </ref>. We are party to the shared research aim of building a better formal understanding of inconsistency, a contribution to this is [Spanoudakis and Finkelstein, 1997].

The problem of process divergence has been analysed by [Cugola et al., 1995] and [Cugola et al., 1996]. <p> It is widely accepted that software development requires more flexibility than business processes, where workflow tools have been instead largely accepted. Our work attempts to provide this flexibility, introducing lightweight mechanisms that support compliance management, rather than enforcement. Previous work which attempts to introduce flexible guidance for example <ref> [Leonhardt et al., 1995] </ref>, while delivering the basic fine-grain mechanisms, still lack adequate means of expressing global. process requirements. We think that by focusing on standards, we are providing firm ground for bridging the gap. This is by no means a silver bullet.

The question of how we can establish that the practices correctly implement these high-level goals is one which needs an answer. Some preliminary work on such correctness problems has been developed in <ref> [Montangero and Semini, 1996] </ref>. Given a large project and a complex set of standards it is important for the compliance manager to be able to get a rapid, high-level view of the position with respect to compliance.
