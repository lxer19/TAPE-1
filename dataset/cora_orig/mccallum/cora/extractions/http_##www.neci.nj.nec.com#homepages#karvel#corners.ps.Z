Title: Characterizing the Distribution of Completion Shapes with Corners Using a Mixture of Random Processes

Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the distribution of contours x(t) generated by fluctuations in _x(t) = @x(t)=@t due to random impulses of two limiting types. The first type are frequent but weak while the second are infrequent but strong. The result has applications in computational theories of figural completion and illusory contours because it can be used to model the prior probability distribution of short, smooth completion shapes punctuated by occasional discontinuities in orientation (i.e., corners). This work extends our previous work on characterizing the distribution of completion shapes which dealt only with the case of frequently acting weak impulses.

This display illustrates the completion of a circle and square under a square occluder. The completion of the square is significant because it includes a discontinuity in orientation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a previous paper <ref> [17] </ref> we derived an analytic expression characterizing a distribution of short, smooth contours. This result has applications in ongoing work on figural completion [18] and perceptual saliency [20]. <p> The distribution of shapes considered by <ref> [3, 12, 17, 19] </ref> basically consists of smooth, short contours. Yet there are many examples in human vision where completion shapes perceived by humans contain discontinuities in orientation (i.e., corners). Figure 1 shows a display by Kanizsa [9]. <p> This leads us to the standard Poisson distribution for the probability of N k independent fluctuations, and simplifies the resulting equation. Should this be an over-simplification, we could still work out P (2 j 1) as discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> While some problems may call for this flexibility in full, it turns out that corners (discontinuities in orientation) can be included by using a mixture of frequent-weak and infrequent-strong impulses. In fact, for our purposes, it will suffice to include only zero or one large impulse per contour. Previously <ref> [17] </ref> we showed how P (2 j 1) =&lt; ffi (x (t 2 )x 2 )ffi ( _x (t 2 ) _x 2 ) &gt; 1 could be obtained from an evaluation of the characteristic functional (k t ) =&lt; exp i R dtk t x t &gt; 1 which since <p> The second parameter in P 0 is t . As noted in Thornber and Williams <ref> [17] </ref>, a decay factor, exp (t=t ), can be included in P (2 j 1) to reduce the role of long contours. <p> When the distribution is dominated by P 1 , the effect of aliasing in orientation becomes evident. 7 Conclusion In our previous paper <ref> [17] </ref>, we assumed that the statistics of occluded shapes could be modeled by minimally-constrained distributions over all paths. <p> We note that the above is valid for general Poisson processes-weak/strong, frequent/infrequent and anything in between. To evaluate P (2 j 1) for the Poisson case one simply calculates the above without the (i@=@) and for = 0, proceeding in a manner analogous to <ref> [17] </ref>.

For example, the functionals of Kass et al.[10] and Mumford and Shah [12] permit orientation discontinuities accompanied by large (but fixed size) penalties. <p> For our figural completion application, 2 report that the percept changes from an illusory circle to an illusory square (see <ref> [18] </ref>). we are especially interested in a shape distribution based upon straight line base-trajectories in two-dimensions modified by random impulses drawn from a mixture of two limiting distributions. The first distribution consists of weak but frequently acting impulses (we call this the Gaussian-limit).
