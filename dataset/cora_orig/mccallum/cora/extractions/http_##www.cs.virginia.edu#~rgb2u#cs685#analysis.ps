Reference: [1] <author> J. L. Lions. </author> <title> Ariane 5: Flight 501 failure. </title> <type> Technical report, Accident Inquiry Board, </type> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: An independent inquiry board found many design flaws leading to the failure <ref> [1] </ref>. Primarily, both the primary and backup inertial reference systems failed due to a software error in data conversion, leading to erroneous positioning data, gross corrections, and finally self-destruction. This sequence occurred because the system was not adequately designed, implemented, and tested.
Reference: [2] <author> Clark S. Turner Nancy Leveson. </author> <title> An investigation of the Therac-25 accidents. </title> <booktitle> IEEE Computer, </booktitle> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: these accidents were a failure to anticipate and resolve race conditions in the design of the machine's software, a failure to provide a mechanical backup to a safety-critical software system, and a failure to provide a suitable user interface to allow the operator to understand the failings of the machine <ref> [2] </ref>. The result was patients who were repeatedly burned after the operator entered a certain time-sensitive sequence of user input.

Reference-contexts: As Petroski stated, we need to study cases like these in order to better understand what can go wrong in the design of software systems <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Ariane 5 Failure In June 1996 the Ariane 5 launcher took flight for the first time and exploded just 40 seconds into the flight sequence. An independent inquiry board found many design flaws leading to the failure [1].
