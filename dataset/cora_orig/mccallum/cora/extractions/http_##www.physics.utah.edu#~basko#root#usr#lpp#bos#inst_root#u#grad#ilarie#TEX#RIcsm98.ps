Abstract: We have investigated the class of disubstituted polyacatylene (PDPA) such as pristine and doped with C 60 , using both transient and steady state spectroscopies. These polymers show high yield photoluminescence which causes spectral narrowing at high excitation intensities, despite of their ground state degeneracy. In PDPA-nBu/C 60 mixture we found photoinduced charge transfer from the degenerate ground state polymer chains to the C 60 molecules.

Reference-contexts: It has been known, however that t-PA has a very weak photoluminescence (PL)band in the infrared spectral range <ref> [1] </ref>, with a quantum efficiency =10 5 . Similarly, monosubstituted t-PA exhibits weak PL in the near infrared [2]. However, intense PL has been observed in soluble disubstituted polyacetylenes such as poly (1-phenyl-2-p-n-butylacetylene (PDPA-nBu) (Fig.1) at 520 nm and poly (1hexyl-2phenyl acetylene)(PHxPA) at 455nm.

Apparently the disubstitu-tion of t-PA drastically changes the optical emission properties.

We also report the results of steady state photoinduced absorption (PA) spectroscopy studies of C 60 doped PDPA-nBu at various doping concentrations. We obtained spectral evidence of photoin-duced charge transfer from the excited state of this polymer onto adjacent C 60 molecule through PA measurements.

Reference-contexts: This is comparable to our best DOO-PPV films [17]. In Fig.3 (a) we show the PA spectrum of a pristine PDPA-nBu film. The spectrum contains only one PA band peaked at 1.7eV which is at much higher energy than the S + absorption band induced upon iodine doping <ref> [5] </ref>. This PA band was identified as due to photogenerated neutral soliton-antisoliton S 0 -S 0 pairs, using photoinduced absorption detected magnetic resonance measurements [5].

Reference-contexts: This is in contrast to the common belief that in DGS polymers the photoinduced charge transfer is suppressed by soliton generation, being faster than the charge transfer process <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition, po-laron and soliton PA bands were also identified. 2. Experimental Thin films of pristine PDPA-nBu were prepared from chloroform solution by spin-casting on quartz substrates. Absorption and PL spectra were measured using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer and a fluorescence Hitachi F-2000 spectrophotometer, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In this case the charge transfer is not favorable in the ground state. It has been shown that there are two different channels for photoinduced charge transfer: either e- transfer from the photoexcited polymer chain, or hole transfer from the photoexcited C 60 molecule <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The weak PL in these DGS polymers has been traditionally explained by the soliton model, in which the primary excitations are soliton-antisoliton (S S) pairs [14].Then upon photoexcitation the photogenerated e-h pair, which immediately (within 100fs) transforms into S + - S <ref> [15] </ref>, relaxes very quickly (within 400fs) into a S 0 - S 0 pair with similar even parity structure as the 2A g state [16].We believe that the strong PL in PDPA-nBu polymer originates from strongly bound S + -S pairs, namely solitonic exciton, which do not imedi-atly transform into the

Reference-contexts: This change of slopes defines a threshold excitation intensity, I th at 1MW/cm 2 or 1mJ/cm 2 per pulse. This is comparable to our best DOO-PPV films <ref> [17] </ref>. In Fig.3 (a) we show the PA spectrum of a pristine PDPA-nBu film. The spectrum contains only one PA band peaked at 1.7eV which is at much higher energy than the S + absorption band induced upon iodine doping [5].

Reference-contexts: The photoinduced infrared active vibrations are the signature of photoinduced charged excitations in the polymer chains. Its huge oscillator strength is caused by the soliton small kinetic mass <ref> [18] </ref>. The optical transitions corresponding to the soliton and polaron species, and the associated energy levels of these excitations are exhibited in Fig.3 (c).

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that C 60 itself does not have any absorption features or PA bands between 0.05-1.4 eV <ref> [19] </ref>; the peak at 1.15eV and its vibronic structures are therefore due to C 60 [20]. The photoin-duced charge transfer between the conjugated polymer chains and intercalated dopant is governed by energetics i.e. by the relative position of thepolymer energy levels with respect to those of the dopant.
