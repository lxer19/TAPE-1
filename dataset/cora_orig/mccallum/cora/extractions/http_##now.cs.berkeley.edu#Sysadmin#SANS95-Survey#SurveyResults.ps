Abstract: Results of the 1995 SANS Survey March 15, 1996 5 Published in The USENIX Association Newsletter October 1995, Volume 20, Number 5 Clearly the largest service provided is troubleshooting. This result matches well with Rob Kolstads 1992 survey [3] on time expenditure, which also found that most of a SAs time was spent dealing with users problems, i.e. troubleshooting. The result that is most amazing to me is the number of people who said they provided all services, or did everything. The feeling of having to provide all services is probably part of the reason why time management and insufficient resources are one of the largest problems for system administrators. These results differ from the time survey in that installation was listed more often than maintenance, although the time expenditure survey said that more time was spent in maintenance than installation. I believe this results from a different classification. I classified many things under troubleshooting that were classified as part of maintenance in the time survey. Furthermore, some operations, such as modifying configuration files are both installation and maintenance tasks. The choice in classification depends on whether the task was performed when the HW/SW was initially received or if it was performed later. This survey provides more up to date information on current site demographics. It shows that considering the number of operating systems is important in determining the amount of work that SAs have to do. It also provides a list of services that SAs provide, to make a better measurement of such service possible. The largest problem seems to be the interaction between users and administrators. Many administrators complained that they were not allowed to say no, and so had to perform all tasks no matter how unreasonable. As Elizabeth Zwicky said in her talk on Goals of System Administration. [4], it is impor tant for users to know some things are unsupported and tasks will not be handled by the administrators. It seems that administrators need to talk with management to establish a list of supported and unsupported services. The list of services provided can be a starting point for developing this new list. The high variance of the data indicates that more samples are needed. For this reason, I have put the survey on-line through http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Sysad-min/surveys.html. This will allow more people to fill out the survey, and hence improve the quality of the conclusions. The author would like to thank Rob Kolstad, Elizabeth Zwicky, Eric Allman, and Dave Patterson for useful feedback on initial versions of the survey; the people who helped hand out and collect the survey at the SANS conference. (Sorry, I didnt record all of your names); and the members of the Network of Workstations project for useful feedback on this article. The a-quantile is the data value that is greater than or equal to an a fraction of the data. Specifically, given a sorted list x[1..n], the a quantile (x a ) is x[1+ (n-1)*a] , where . represents rounding to the nearest integer, or down if the value is exactly half way between two integers. The 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 quantiles are called the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles. The 2nd quartile (0.5 quantile) is also called the median. Results of the 1995 SANS Survey March 15, 1996 4 Published in The USENIX Association Newsletter October 1995, Volume 20, Number 5 Given the very high variability of all of this data, all of these conclusions should be considered tentative. Correlation coefficient calculations include standard deviations and means, and hence may be biased by outliers. Regardless, some of the correlations in the data make intuitive sense. Except at the smallest 25% of sites, the correlation between machines and administrators was much stronger than the correlation between users and administrators. Increasing the number of machines results in more complexity, and hence requires more people. As sites progress toward having 2-3 machines per user, it will be interesting to see if this correlation remains. I took all the answers, and categorized the problems and services. Then I sorted them by the number of people with answers in each category to discover which problems and services were most commonly mentioned. Some answers were put into multiple categories because people listed multiple problems or services. I provide more detail on the top three problems.
