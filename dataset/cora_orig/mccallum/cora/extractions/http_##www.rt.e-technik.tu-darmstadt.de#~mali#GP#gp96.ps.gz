Abstract: The article at hand discusses a tool for automatic generation of structured models for complex dynamic processes by means of genetic programming. In contrast to other techniques which use genetic programming to find an appropriate arithmetic expression in order to describe the input-output behaviour of a process, this tool is based on a block oriented approach with a transparent description of signal paths. A short survey on other techniques for computer based system identification is given and the basic concept of SMOG (Structured MOdel Generator) is described. Furthermore latest extensions of the system are presented in detail, including automatically defined sub-models and quali tative fitness criteria.

Reference-contexts: In the past two years its capabilities have been proven in different applications, e.g. the modelling of a river barrage system in cooperation with AEG Daimler Benz Industrie AG, Germany, (Marenbach et al. 1995) and an industrial biological fed-batch fermentation process within an cooperation with BASF AG, Germany <ref> (Bettenhausen et al. 1995) </ref>. Furthermore SMOG was tested on several artificial problems and on data taken from an industrial steel rolling process at Daimler Benz AG, Germany (Pohlheim and Marenbach 1996).

Reference-contexts: parameter optimization but all data for the error calculation so that overfitting does not lead to high fitness values. 5 Qualitative fitness criteria An alternative for the integration of two or more optimization objectives to achieve a single quality or fitness value is the search for the so-called Pareto optimality <ref> ( Goldberg 1989, Fonseca and Fleming 1993) </ref>. These and other techniques described in literature lead to a population of Pareto optimal individuals which are more or less equally distributed in the Pareto optimal subspace. But this is not the main aim for the application of SMOG. <p> According to inversion theorems of the boolean algebra fol lows IF ~ E is low or ~ C is low THEN f is high. The question of a useful normalization method has not been discussed yet. General possibilities are simple scaling methods <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref>, an approach for the optimization of a vector performance index proposed by Kreisselmeier and Steinhauser (1979) or separate rankings for each objective with subsequent scaling.

Reference-contexts: However both of these approaches were not able to generate models which include dynamic explicitly. Instead similar to NNs time delayed input values had to be included into the terminal set. The extended system &lt;-STROGANOFF <ref> (Iba et al. 1995) </ref> provides a mechanism to generate models with explicit dynamics. This is achieved by propagating the model output values as additional input values for the next time step.

Reference-contexts: Due to these simplifications, the values of parameters which were derived from physical reflections soon loose their original meaning. Therefore data driven techniques are required to estimate these parameters which are usually described by the term system or parameter identification <ref> (Isermann 1981) </ref>. However, a priori knowledge of the mathematical structure of the model is essential for a successful application (and the model has to be linear in the unknown parameters, which is usually no serious restriction in practice).

Reference-contexts: The tree structure allows only forks from the output towards the input variables. Following the mechanism of automatic defined functions (ADF) proposed by Koza (1992) <ref> (for detailed examinations see Koza 1994) </ref>, the new release of SMOG supports internal states and additional outputs. internal state: tree structure (top) and block diagram (bot tom). Internal states similar to ADFs are results of fixed predefined subtrees. They are very similar to the outputs in principle.

Reference-contexts: Looking at the form a chemist expresses his process knowledge, it appears that it is basically oriented on signal paths and only a vague idea about dynamics exists. Therefore from the very beginning <ref> (Marenbach 1994) </ref> SMOG uses a block diagram representation often used in control theory - which is based on a description of interactions between input and output variables in the sense of a directed graph.

Reference-contexts: arise from the fact that in general the values defined for accu-racy and this penalty value are of different order of magnitude and that the parsimony pressure does not only influence the selection of a single individual but has a strong impact on the evolutionary development of the whole population <ref> (for more details see Nordin and Banzhaf 1995) </ref>. SMOG assesses the accuracy of a model i by an error value E i which is defined as the root-mean-square error between given process behaviour and simulated model response.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore SMOG was tested on several artificial problems and on data taken from an industrial steel rolling process at Daimler Benz AG, Germany <ref> (Pohlheim and Marenbach 1996) </ref>. Besides this description the underlying approach is compared with other work in the field of GP and as an extension of the previous system several new techniques are introduced.

Reference-contexts: With each modification of the model structure, the set of parameters has to be re-estimated. This makes modelling a time consuming and therefore expensive task. 2.2 Neural Networks In cases as described above the use of Neural Networks <ref> (NN, Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref> or other associative memory systems (Tolle and Ersu 1992) as process models is suggested as a possibility to reduce modelling efforts. These techniques approximate nonlinear mappings by interpolating between information learned from a given training data set.
