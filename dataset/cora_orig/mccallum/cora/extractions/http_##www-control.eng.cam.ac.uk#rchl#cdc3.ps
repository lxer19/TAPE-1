Abstract: We investigate some robustness compromises involved in achieving attenuation for periodic disturbances. We consider asymptotic rejection or attenuation of disturbance harmonics and transient response.

Reference-contexts: Thus, asymptotic rejection of all harmonics is not a practicable proposition. However, no robustness compromise is required at a given harmonic if jP (j! k )j p 1+jP (j! k )j 2 b opt (P ). We mention that the above proposition is closely related to results of <ref> [1] </ref> on the regulator problem with robust stability. We now turn to the question of the best attenuation which can be achieved subject to a given robustness level. Proposition 2 Suppose 0 &lt; ff b opt (P ).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A goal of repetitive control is to ensure tracking/disturbance rejection of periodic references/disturbances. If it is desired to achieve asymptotic tracking/rejection, the internal model principle (see <ref> [2] </ref>) suggests that the controller needs to contain poles at the frequency of the periodic signal and all its non-zero harmonics (possibly infinitely many).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, if the plant P is strictly proper then the robustness margin will be zero if all harmonics are included. Even if P is invertible at infinity (unlikely in practice) it is easy to check that the control system fails to be w-stable in the sense of <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, asymptotic rejection of all harmonics is not a practicable proposition. However, no robustness compromise is required at a given harmonic if jP (j! k )j p 1+jP (j! k )j 2 b opt (P ).

Reference-contexts: We will use the gap metric robustness margin as our measure of uncertainty tolerance which is given by <ref> [4] </ref>: b P;C := fl fl I fl fl 1 : The optimal robustness margin of P is b opt (P ) := sup C stblz b P;C . We consider a finite set of frequencies n := fj! 1 ; :::; j! n g.

Reference-contexts: This was the original idea of Inoue et al. [8] who proposed using a positive feedback around a time delay to generate an internal model of the periodic disturbance. It was observed by a number of authors that such a scheme lacks robustness (see <ref> [5] </ref>, [6]). We demonstrate this fact here in the context of gap metric uncertainty (Proposition 1). On the other hand we show that a reasonable level of asymptotic attenuation of periodic disturbances can always be achieved without serious robustness compromises (Proposition 2). <p> We mention work on stability conditions and synthesis methods in <ref> [5] </ref>, [6] and [12]. For discrete time approaches see [10] and the references therein. A sampled-data repetitive control design methodology, in which inter-sample be-haviour was taken into account, can be found in [9].
