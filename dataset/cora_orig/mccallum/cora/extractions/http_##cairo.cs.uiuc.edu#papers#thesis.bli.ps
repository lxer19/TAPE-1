Reference: [1] <author> V. Bharghavan. </author> <title> Challenges and Solutions to Adaptive Computing and Seamless Mobility over Heterogeneous Wireless Networks. </title> <note> to appear in the International Journal on Wireless Personal Communications: Special Issue on Mobile and Wireless Networking, </note> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: Such MIBs, derived from the SNMP protocol, may be used to integrate application level QoS management mechanisms into standard network management frameworks. Recent research interests in mobile computing also address the issues in Quality of Service adaptations for mobile transmissions over heterogeneous wireless networks <ref> [1] </ref> [21]. These research efforts focus on graceful adaptations to dynamic Quality of Service variations in the environment of mobile computing. Current state-of-the-art mobile environments must deal with scarce and dynamically varying resources, in particular, the network Quality of Service. <p> The impulse function shown in the figure is ffi (n 0:1). 1 The x axis of the graph denotes time, in the unit of second. Same applies to all similar graphs in this chapter. The y axis is normalized to the range of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 34 We will frequently refer to the concept of impulse response of an adaptor. It is defined as the response of an adaptor when the excitation signal is a simple impulse function ffi (n). <p> The y axis denotes a real number as a coefficient in the difference equation. 69 Furthermore, it is often convenient to normalize the frequency response function to unity, namely in the range of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, giving a logarithmic plot with a maximum of 0 dB in the passband. We illustrate the frequency response plotted to the logarithmic scale in figure 4.4 2 . We now apply this adaptor to actual QoS metrics generated by the network QoS simulator illustrated in figure 4.2. <p> Similar to the last section, for better visibility of passband ripples and sidelobes, we still chose to plot the frequency response function to logarithmic scales rather than linear scales. We also normalized the frequency response function to the range of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, giving a logarithmic plot with a maximum of 0 dB in the passband. We illustrated the frequency response plotted to the logarithmic scale in figure 4.7 4 .

Reference-contexts: There are also research efforts that address the problems related to adaptations or graceful degradations of Quality of Service. The Quality of Service Architecture (QoS-A) developed at Lancaster University <ref> [2] </ref> targets a lay 8 ered architecture of services and mechanisms for QoS management and control of media flows in multiservice networks. Among others, the QoS specification supports the notion of QoS scaling policy to identify the QoS adaptation [23] similar to the notion of adaptors developed in this thesis.

Reference-contexts: In more practical aspects, previous research efforts also focus on the preservation of Quality of Service, particularly in the case of audio and video transmissions, over best effort environments such as the Internet. Outstanding examples include the work at University of Illinois <ref> [3] </ref>, in which a real time protocol referred to as the Video Datagram Protocol (VDP) for transmitting video and audio data over best effort environments was developed. VDP reduces inter-frame jitter and dynamically adapted to the client CPU load and network congestion.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the metrics mentioned above for an adaptor, we propose an extended Quality of Service specification mechanism to specify the Adaptive Quality of Service desired by the application. We introduce the Imprecise Computational Model <ref> [4] </ref>, that suits the QoS requirements of flexible tasks in flexible applications. It is possible to design a wide range of multimedia real-time applications so that their tasks are flexible. The output quality of these applications improves while the provided Quality of Service improves. <p> In order to model the QoS demands of these flexible applications or tasks, we apply the Imprecise Computation Model <ref> [4] </ref> [12] [5] [13], which originated from the research of hard real-time scheduling for computational tasks.

Reference-contexts: For example, allocating a tracking application more processor time to complete a better but more complex tracking algorithm leads to a lower probability 7 of producing false tracks. Research on Imprecise Computation in areas as diverse as digital control systems <ref> [5] </ref> and artificial intelligence [12] have shown it to be a feasible and effective approach. <p> In order to model the QoS demands of these flexible applications or tasks, we apply the Imprecise Computation Model [4] [12] <ref> [5] </ref> [13], which originated from the research of hard real-time scheduling for computational tasks. <p> This graph is generated by Mathematica, with * = 0:3 and ! off = 1:2. The generating function is obtained from equation (3.57): Chebyshev = Plot [(1/Sqrt [1 + 0.32 * ChebyshevT <ref> [5, x] </ref> * (x / 1.2)], 56 (x, 0, 3)] where n is the order and ! off is the cut-off frequency. C n is referred to as the Chebyshev polynomial of nth order.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed design of the system is illustrated in figure 4.2. For the purpose of fast prototyping and achieving capabilities to execute on heterogeneous environments, we used the Java language <ref> [6] </ref> for the implementation of the prototype adaptor. The Video-On-Demand application testbed, though, was implemented in a combination of C and Java languages, where the MPEG decompression engine was implemented in C due to the nature of MPEG-2 decompression complexity. The whole testbed was implemented in the Windows NT environment.

Reference-contexts: The work focuses on mapping and translation of QoS parameters. Not much attention is paid to adaptation issues. The Quality Assurance Language (QuAL) developed at Columbia University <ref> [7] </ref> presents a new specification language referred to as QuAL. QuAL abstractions allow the specification of QoS constraints expected from the underlying computing and communication environment. These specifications are compiled into run-time components that monitor the actual Quality of Service delivered from the underlying layers.

Reference-contexts: The research efforts on switch-based flow control algorithms in the transport and network layers also provide valuable basis for the research presented in this thesis. Among them, we take the work at University of Texas as an example <ref> [8] </ref>. The work presents an adaptive network layer protocol for variable bit rate (VBR) video transport, which minimizes buffer requirement in the network while guaranteeing that packets of VBR encoded video flows will not be lost. It also works to minimize the end-to-end delay and jitter of video frames.

Reference-contexts: (n) = fix (n) (3.8) Substituting equation (3.6) in equation (3.8), we have y (n) = fi k=1 = k=1 x (k)fiffi (n k) = k=1 = k=1 where the second line is deduced by a simple change of variable, and the last line is deduced based on the proved <ref> [9] </ref> commutative property of convolution: x (n) y (n) = y (n) x (n) (3.10) where the convolution operator N is defined by: x (n) y (n) = k=1 The relation shown in 3.9, known as the convolution summation property, is of considerable importance in the characterization as well as analysis <p> In other words, the final difference equation coefficients are derived by time-domain multiplications. The modulation property <ref> [9] </ref> of the Fourier Transform shows that time-domain multiplication is equivalent to frequency-domain convolution. <p> Consequently, we may expect that a windowing function with more gentle curves in the time domain will introduce less ripples and sidelobes in the frequency domain. In theories related to digital signal processing <ref> [9] </ref>, two widely accepted windowing functions are referred to as the von Hann window and the Hamming window. <p> By applying the bilinear transformation, given the transfer function H (s) of the Chebyshev approximation, we can readily generate the transfer function H (z) of its discrete-time counter 58 part. However, the transfer function of the Chebyshev approximation is relatively complex. For--tunately, the bilinear transformation has already been done <ref> [9] </ref>. We describe the result of the transformation by giving formulae for the z-plane pole-zero locations. A Chebyshev approximation of nth order has n poles in the z-plane, and an nth-order real zero at z = 1. <p> An comprehensive example will be demonstrated in section 4.4. 3.8 Conclusion In this chapter, we introduced models derived from developed theories in digital control systems and digital signal processing systems <ref> [9] </ref> [10] to analyze and configure the adaptors modeled by non-recursive or recursive difference equations.

Reference-contexts: We can indicate this fact notationally as: y (nT ) = fix (nT ) (2.30) where fi is an operator. Equation 2.30 can be treated as a generic definition for the Quality of Service adaptors that we will discuss in later chapters. Like other digital systems <ref> [10] </ref>, adaptors can be classified with respect to time-invariance, causality, linearity and recursiveness. Time Invariance An adaptor is said to be time-invariant if its response to an arbitrary excitation does not depend on the time of application of the excitation. <p> The general form of the difference equations that we address can be expressed as equation (2.46) in the previous chapter: N X a i y (n i) = i=0 In this chapter, we will introduce theories in digital control systems [22] <ref> [10] </ref> to analyze and configure the adaptors modeled by the above difference equations. Specifically, we will utilize z-transform, an important mathematical transformation method introduced in digital systems control theory, and analyze the frequency domain responses of the adaptive behavior of an adaptor. <p> express all the poles of H (z) defined in equation (3.28) in polar forms: p i = r i e j i ; f or i = 1; 2; : : : ; N (3.42) where r i is the radius and i is the angle. we can prove that <ref> [10] </ref>: r i &lt; 1 f or i = 1; 2; : : : ; N (3.43) is the necessary and sufficient condition for deciding that the adaptor is stable. <p> Similarly, the definition for the Hamming window is: w (n) = &gt; &lt; 0:54 + 0:46 cos n 0 elsewhere. (3.54) The corresponding spectrum function of both the von Hann window and Hamming window is given by: W () = w (0) + 2 k=1 Experiences <ref> [10] </ref> showed that the Hamming window performs better, thus it will be chosen in lieu of the rectangular window in the configuration of adaptation agility of adaptors. <p> An comprehensive example will be demonstrated in section 4.4. 3.8 Conclusion In this chapter, we introduced models derived from developed theories in digital control systems and digital signal processing systems [9] <ref> [10] </ref> to analyze and configure the adaptors modeled by non-recursive or recursive difference equations. We addressed the analysis of both the exci 59 tation signals and the adaptive transformation itself in the time domain and frequency domain, and utilized the Discrete Fourier Transform and z-transform for analysis and configuration purposes.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this work is also similar with the work presented in this thesis, though the former only focuses on delay jitter adaptations during audio transmissions. Similar research work also includes the work presented in <ref> [11] </ref>, which also focuses on jitter control of playing back continuous media streams. While the above mentioned work deals only with audio transmissions, various playout algorithms for video transmissions have also been discussed in previous research efforts, especially in the context of Video-On-Demand applications.

The work at University of Pennsylvania <ref> [16] </ref>, for example, mainly focuses on the playout requirements in destination end systems, assuming constant rate transmission of video data in Video-On-Demand applications over the ATM network. <p> This work is analogous to the presented work in this thesis in the sense that we also deal with problems with the playback buffer space in the end systems, though our adaptation algorithm will be more complicated than the work presented in <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recursiveness In this thesis, we only address the analysis and configuration of the subset of adaptors that are time-invariant, causal and linear. Similar to the analog control systems in the control theory <ref> [22] </ref> that are characterized in terms of differential equations, we characterize this subset of adaptors in terms of difference equations. There are two types of adaptors that can be identified, non-recursive and recursive adaptors. <p> The general form of the difference equations that we address can be expressed as equation (2.46) in the previous chapter: N X a i y (n i) = i=0 In this chapter, we will introduce theories in digital control systems <ref> [22] </ref> [10] to analyze and configure the adaptors modeled by the above difference equations. Specifically, we will utilize z-transform, an important mathematical transformation method introduced in digital systems control theory, and analyze the frequency domain responses of the adaptive behavior of an adaptor. <p> Service that is delivered to the applications. 3.2 Time Domain Analysis and the Convolution Summation Property 3.2.1 Overview In order to analyze the time-domain properties of the difference equations that describe the behavior of the adaptors defined in equation (2.46), methods in time domain analysis of traditional analog control systems <ref> [22] </ref> use several elementary functions such as the unit impulse function, the unit step function, etc. Similar functions also apply to the discrete-time difference equations. The discrete-time unit step, unit ramp, exponential and sinusoid functions are generated by letting t = nT in the corresponding continuous-time functions. <p> By applying the Convolution Summation Property, introduced in the next section, we are able to derive the response to any excitation signals by calculating convolution with the impulse response of the adaptor. 35 3.2.2 Convolution Summation Property It can be proved in control theory <ref> [22] </ref> that, the response of an adaptor to an arbitrary excitation can be expressed in terms of the impulse response of the adaptor. <p> convolution operator N is defined by: x (n) y (n) = k=1 The relation shown in 3.9, known as the convolution summation property, is of considerable importance in the characterization as well as analysis of adaptors and is an important part in the time domain analysis in the control theory <ref> [22] </ref>. Given this property, we can derive the response 37 of an adaptor to any excitation signals, once we know the impulse response h (n) of the adaptor. This demonstrates that the impulse response h (n) fully represents all the time domain properties of the transformation process of an adaptor. <p> As known in the control theory <ref> [22] </ref>, an unit impulse in the frequency domain maps to an infinitely long time window-ing function in the time domain, and vice versa. Intuitively, if the windowing function suddenly chops off in the time domain, it tends to spread out in the frequency domain. <p> One of the suitable approaches for configuration is to transform the available continuous-time transfer functions into the desired discrete-time difference equations. The theories related to the study of analog signals and analog control systems <ref> [22] </ref> have been evolved for years and are readily available for the purpose of discrete-time adaptation design. As a comparison, while in the discrete-time cases we used z transform, the Laplace transform plays a similar role in the continuous-time analog design.
