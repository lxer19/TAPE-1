Title: THE USE OF GRAPH THEORY IN A PARALLEL MULTIFRONTAL METHOD FOR SEQUENCES OF UNSYMMETRIC PATTERN
Author: STEVEN M. HADFIELD AND TIMOTHY A. DAVIS 
Abstract: Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department, University of Florida, Technical Report TR-95-016, April 1995. Abstract. Multifrontal matrix factorization methods used for solving large, sparse systems of linear equations decompose sparse matrices into overlapping dense submatrices which can be represented by vertices with relationships between submatrices shown via various types of edges. This paper describes the use of graph theory in a new parallel, distributed memory multifrontal method for the LU factorization of sequences of matrices with an identical, unsymmetric pattern. The directed acyclic graphs formed by these vertices and the various edge sets are used to structure the computations, schedule the parallel factorization, and provide a robust capability to dynamically change the pivot ordering to maintain numerical stability. Pivot reordering determines necessary permutations based on a path analysis of two component edge sets. The path properties represented by these edge sets define the impacts of these permutations on the structures of the submatrices and the number of nonzeros in the matrix factors. Transitive reductions of these edge sets provide the communications paths needed for parallel implementation.

Reference-contexts: With symmetric pattern multifrontal methods, the assembly DAG is a tree (or forest) as each frontal matrix's contribution block can be completely absorbed within a single subsequent frontal matrix <ref> [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13] </ref>. With the unsymmetric pattern multifrontal method, the contribution block can be fragmented and portions must be passed to different subsequent frontal matrices which results in more generalized DAG structure.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, these methods always assumed a symmetric structure in the system. Recently Davis and Duff have developed an unsymmetric pattern multifrontal method based on LU factorization which can significantly reduce the amount of required computations for systems with an unsymmetric structure <ref> [3] </ref>. Comparison studies have shown this method to frequently be the most efficient method for solving such systems [14]. <p> Actually, the assembly DAG edge set is a much smaller subset of these true relations and can include `early assembly edges' that allow contributions to be combined earlier (See <ref> [3] </ref> for details). In order to establish criteria for a sufficient edge set for inter-frontal matrix recovery, we will now distinguish between the `true relations' and the assembly edges as two distinct edge sets. <p> Conclusion. This paper has described the use of graph theory in a technique for the LU factorization of sequences of identically structured sparse matrices which is based on the highly successful unsymmetric pattern multifrontal method of Davis and Duff <ref> [3] </ref>. The graph theory centers on the concept of the assembly DAG which provides the basic computational structure of the method. Graph analysis techniques are used facilitate frontal matrix task scheduling.
