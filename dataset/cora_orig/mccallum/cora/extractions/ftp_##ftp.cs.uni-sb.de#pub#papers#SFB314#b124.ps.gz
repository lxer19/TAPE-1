Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Despite the intrinsic difficulty of both natural language processing and image understanding, the integration of vision and language increasingly attracts attention in current research (see e.g. [ Amsili et al. 95 ] , <ref> [ AI Review 94 ] </ref> , [ McKevitt 94 ] ).

Reference-contexts: In VITRA, incremental high-level scene analysis comprises modules for the evaluation of spatial relations (see <ref> [ Andre et al. 87 ] </ref> , [ Herzog 95 ] , [ Gapp 94 ] ) and the recognition of interesting motion events (see [ Herzog 92 ] ), as well as presumed intentions, plans, and plan interactions of the observed agents (see [ Retz-Schmidt 91 ] ).

Reference-contexts: The conceptual structures on the cognitive level bridge the gap between visual data and natural language concepts, such as spatial prepositions, motion or action verbs and temporal adverbs. Language production in VITRA includes processes that handle the selection, linearization and encoding of propositions (see <ref> [ Andre et al. 88 ] </ref> , [ Herzog & Wazinski 94 ] ). To meet the requirements of simultaneous scene description, an incremental generation strategy is employed in our approach.

Reference-contexts: The simultaneous evaluation and natural language description of real world image sequences provides a basis for further investigations on the integration of vision and language. Current research in VITRA concentrates on transfering the developed methodology to application areas like (1) intelligent multimedia systems (see <ref> [ Andre et al. 94 ] </ref> ), (2) driver support systems in road vehicles (see [ Maa 94; Maa et al. 93 ] ), and (3) autonomous mobile robot systems (see [ Langle et al. 95; Stopp et al. 94 ] ). 6 Technical Notes The VITRA system is written in

Reference-contexts: Natural language is a natural communication medium for humans. So computer systems which are able to communicate in natural language meet human needs much better. Up to now, however, there have only been a few attempts at connecting vision systems with natural language access systems. Badler <ref> [ Badler 75 ] </ref> developed a first proposal for describing object trajectories in terms of motion primitives and more complex combined motion patterns, corresponding to verbs and adverbials in natural language.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical aspects of linking language and perception have been considered by Waltz [ Waltz 81 ] . He emphasizes the importance of natural language scene descriptions. LANDSCAN <ref> [ Bajcsy et al. 85 ] </ref> is a natural language system, which answers questions about aerial images. In LANDSCAN, processing spans the entire way from sensor input to natural language output, but it only deals with static scenes.
