Brachman and Etherington <ref> [1] </ref> suggest that since vivid reasoning will not be able to capture the full range of problem-solving behavior, an intelligent program should have both a vivid knowledge base and a general problem-solver for more difficult "puzzle-mode" reasoning.

Reference-contexts: How might this be axiomatized so that we can conclude that the car was, in fact, stolen? There are several nonmonotonic logics within which this sort of reasoning can be done (e.g. [7, 8, 9]). As Hanks and McDermott <ref> [2] </ref> point out, these logics all suffer from the difficulty that there will in general be more than one valid extension from a given theory, where only some of those extensions correspond to conclusions that we intuitively see as correct. Various fixes have been proposed for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus, while we have captured roughly the same intuitions as Shoham's CMI formalization, we have sacrificed the efficiency of his special purpose inference method. 5.3 The parking lot problem One difficulty with Shoham's CMI was raised by Kautz <ref> [4] </ref>. CMI delays action as long as possible, forcing us to conclude that actions happen only at the last possible moment. In his parking-lot scenario, Kautz suggests that 5 We retain the old versions|(1)-(3)|to apply in case ! 1 may be true. <p> Various fixes have been proposed for this problem. In formal systems for temporal reasoning, a popular solution has been to incorporate the asymmetric structure of time into the process of selecting extensions to a given theory <ref> [4, 14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Selman and Kautz's tractability results do not address the problems of goal-directed reasoning|Is there a maximal model endorsing some conclusion?| or skeptical reasoning|Do all maximal models endorse that conclusion? In other work, Kautz and Selman <ref> [5] </ref> suggest that the computational complexity of these problems is likely to be significantly worse than the arbitrary extension (model-finding) problem. This section explores the ramifications of the restriction to model-finding for vivid reasoning. Similar issues arise in sections 5 and 6, below.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In an award-winning paper <ref> [11] </ref>, Selman and Kautz presented the logic of model-preference defaults (MPD). MPD is a family of propositional default logics intended as a testbed for exploring nonmonotonic reasoning. Selman and Kautz define the search problem of finding a maximal model given an MPD axiomatization. <p> In this sense, the current paper is something of an indictment of MPD. 2 Background and Terminology This section briefly reviews the logic of MPD as presented by Kautz and Selman <ref> [11] </ref>. The reader familiar with their work may wish to skip to the next section. An MPD axiomatization is a pair hT; Di. T is a set of formulae in the propositional calculus, referred to as the (monotonic or propositional) theory. <p> In <ref> [11] </ref>, Selman and Kautz use the complexity of certain sublanguages of MPD to derive intractability results for Reiter's default logic (DL) [9]. We give a general translation procedure from MPD axiomatizations in DH + a to DL. <p> In <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, they prove a number of complexity results for various restricted classes of MPD axiomatizations. In this paper, we argue that the relevance of those results is restricted by the limitations of the formalism itself.

Reference-contexts: DH is the set of MPD axiomatizations with "Horn-form" defaults: if ff ! fi is a default, then ff contains no negated literals. DH + adds specificity; DH a and DH + a require that the defaults be acyclic and Horn-form. In <ref> [12] </ref>, Selman and Kautz show that the search problems for D, D + and DH + with empty theories are N P-hard. There is a linear algorithm for DH with an empty propositional theory, but when DH is augmented by a Horn-form monotonic theory, it becomes N P-hard. <p> In <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, they prove a number of complexity results for various restricted classes of MPD axiomatizations. In this paper, we argue that the relevance of those results is restricted by the limitations of the formalism itself.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the inheritance reasoning of MPD is upwards|it concerns the properties possessed by a Boddy et al. | Investigations of Model Preference Defaults 8 given entity. The differences between these approaches are detailed elsewhere <ref> [13, 17] </ref>; most notably, Levesque and Selman demonstrate that most upwards reasoning is tractable while downward reasoning is, in general, N P-hard. To translate an inheritance hierarchy into MPD, we can simply replace the edges of the hierarchy|e.g., that Quakers are generally Pacifists|with the corresponding default rule: Q ! P.

Reference-contexts: In general, it is not likely that MPD will be suited to simulation of Touretzky-style inheritance, or to capturing the more complicated ("off-path") versions of preemption found in much of the literature. Boddy et al. | Investigations of Model Preference Defaults 12 5.2 Chronological Minimization Shoham <ref> [14] </ref> describes a model of temporal reasoning based on the logic of chronological maximal ignorance (CMI). CMI uses the idea that time moves forward to solve two major problems of reasoning about action and change over time: qualification and extended prediction. <p> Various fixes have been proposed for this problem. In formal systems for temporal reasoning, a popular solution has been to incorporate the asymmetric structure of time into the process of selecting extensions to a given theory <ref> [4, 14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: MPDs with Horn-form theories can be used to represent inheritance hierarchies with strict and defeasible links, yielding a polynomial time algorithm for inheritance comparable to that of Stein <ref> [15] </ref>. However, the addition of specificity relies on an elaborate translation mechanism. In any case, the result differs from standard inheritance theories in that it is 1 Explicit is taken to mean directly represented or represented as a simple relation among expressions. <p> For example, in figure 5, information about penguins is more specific to Tweety than information about birds, so we'd like to conclude that Tweety doesn't fly. To accomplish this, we need to invoke a preemption detection scheme. Here, we show how to adapt that of Stein <ref> [15] </ref>. First, for each node, x, we create a unique new propositional variable| only one of these models. (See section 4, above.) Boddy et al. | Investigations of Model Preference Defaults 10 say, ^x. We will use ^x to indicate that x is the node whose properties we're reasoning about. <p> It uses a simple ("on-path") pre 3 x is reachable from a if there are a sequence of positive edges, or a sequence of positive edges followed by a single negative edge, from a to x. 4 For a detailed analysis of complexity, see <ref> [15, Theorem 3] </ref>, from which this algorithm is derived.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we explore one such translation and examine the adequacy of MPD for inheritance. Touretzky et al. [17] identify several dimensions along which existing theories of inheritance vary. The version of inheritance originally proposed by Touretzky <ref> [16] </ref> is downwards|it involves reasoning about which objects have a given property or belong to a given class. In contrast, the inheritance reasoning of MPD is upwards|it concerns the properties possessed by a Boddy et al. | Investigations of Model Preference Defaults 8 given entity.
