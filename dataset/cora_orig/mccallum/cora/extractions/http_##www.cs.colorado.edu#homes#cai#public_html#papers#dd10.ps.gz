Reference: [1] <author> X.-C. Cai, M. Dryja and M. Sarkis, </author> <title> A convergence theory for restricted additive Schwarz methods, </title> <note> in preparation. </note>
Reference-contexts: Because of the page limit, we shall restrict our discussion to this particular preconditioner. Other issues can be found in the papers <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. We remark that the action of R 0 i to a vector does not involve any communication in a parallel implementation, but R i does. As a result, RAS is cheaper than AS in terms of the communication cost.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on the study of a parallel restricted additive Schwarz preconditioned iterative method for solving (6) with various ffi. More discussions and computational experience with the selection of the nonlinear and linear stopping tolerance t and ffi can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 RAS with minimum overlap We now describe a version of the RAS preconditioner, which was recently introduced in [3], with the smallest possible non-zero overlap. <p> Because of the page limit, we shall restrict our discussion to this particular preconditioner.

Reference-contexts: We partition the mesh by using the TOP/DOMDEC package <ref> [5] </ref>. We require that all subdomains have more or less the same number of mesh points. An effort is made to reduce the number of mesh points along the interfaces of subdomains to reduce the communication cost.

Reference-contexts: We locate the variables at the vertices of the grid, which gives rise to a cell-vertex scheme. The space of solutions is taken to be the space of piecewise linear continuous functions. The discrete system is obtained via a finite volume formulation; see e.g., Koobus and Farhat <ref> [11] </ref>. We determine the nth time step size t n in the following way. Let CFL be a pre-selected positive number.
