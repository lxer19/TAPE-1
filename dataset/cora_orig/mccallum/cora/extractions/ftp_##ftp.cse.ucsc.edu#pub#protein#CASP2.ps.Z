Abstract: We discuss how methods based on hidden Markov models performed in the fold-recognition section of the CASP2 experiment. Hidden Markov models were built for a representative set of just over one thousand structures from the Protein Data Bank (pdb). Each CASP2 target sequence was scored against this library of hmms. In addition, an hmm was built for each of the target sequences, and all of the sequences in pdb were scored against that target model, with a good score on both methods indicating a high probability that the target sequence is homologous to the structure. The method worked well in comparison to other methods used at CASP2 for targets of moderate difficulty, where the closest structure in pdb could be aligned to the target with at least 15% residue identity.

Reference-contexts: The priors reflect different patterns of sequence conservation, such as invariant or hydrophobic, and can be combined with data from aligned ho-mologs to form data-dependent parameter estimates. This differentiates our approach from that of Eisenberg and colleagues <ref> [7] </ref>, which incorporates more structural and less sequence information. In the CASP2 experiments, we developed a new sequence weighting scheme (see Section 2.3), and a method for constructing joint models for two sets of presumably homologous proteins (Section 2.4).

Reference-contexts: To reduce training-set bias, sequence-weighting schemes assign relative weights to training sequences. The particular method used to assign the relative weights in the CASP2 contest is described in the technical report [14], but similar results would have been obtained by using a scheme such as the Henikoffs' <ref> [8] </ref> for the relative weights.

Reference-contexts: This alignment and the corresponding hmm parameters were re-estimated using standard hmm methods in combination with priors over amino acids and transition probabilities in various structural environments <ref> [14] </ref>. The transition priors allowed us to incorporate general structural information, such as the low probability of an insert in the middle of a helix. <p> This initial model was used to select homologs from a set of neighbors from the Entrez database. The model parameters were re-estimated repeatedly on the target sequence and homologs, using Dirichlet mixture densities over amino acid distributions and a variety of different transition priors <ref> [14] </ref>. Because proteins can have repeated domains, the multdomain module of SAM was used to select subsequences from the putative homolog set. For instance, some homologs to t0004 (the nucleotidyltransferase S1 motif) had 3 or 4 regions that matched the model. <p> To reduce training-set bias, sequence-weighting schemes assign relative weights to training sequences. The particular method used to assign the relative weights in the CASP2 contest is described in the technical report <ref> [14] </ref>, but similar results would have been obtained by using a scheme such as the Henikoffs' [8] for the relative weights. <p> By way of contrast, a PAM distance of 120 is about 1.0 bits per column and a PAM distance of 240 is about 0.5 bits per column. The total weights assigned ranged from 0.28 to 1.19 for numbers of sequences ranging from 5 to 147 <ref> [14] </ref>. 2.4 Estimating joint models If a structure and target are distant homologs, the alignment of the target homologs to the structure model may not maintain a good mutual alignment of the target homologs, and conversely for an alignment of the structure homologs to the target model.

Reference-contexts: Sequence weighting was used to control the generality of the model (see Section 2.3). For some targets (t0011,t0019, t0026, t0030), the initial set of training sequences was too small, and so a search was done of a non-redundant protein database <ref> [19] </ref> using the model, and the sequences with cost less than -8.0 nats 2 were considered possible homologs.
