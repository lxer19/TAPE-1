Abstract: Technical Report #1111 September 1992 Abstract We present an approach for solving the path planning problem for a mobile robot operating in an unknown, three dimensional environment containing obstacles of arbitrary shape. The main contributions of this paper are (1) an analysis of the type of sensing information that is necessary and sufficient for solving the path planning problem in such environments, and (2) the development of a framework for designing a provably-correct algorithm to solve this problem. No such analysis is currently available for the case where the robot is able to freely move in space (i.e., has three degrees of freedom in position). Working from first principles, without any assumptions about the environment of the robot or its sensing capabilities, our analysis shows that the ability to explore the obstacle surfaces (i.e., to make all their points visible) is intrinsically linked with the ability to plan the motion of the robot. We argue that current approaches to the path planning problem with incomplete information simply do not extend to the general three-dimensional case, and that qualitatively different algorithms are needed. We also present a simple algorithm for solving the three-dimensional path planning problem, under the assumption that an exploration algorithm is available to the robot.

Reference-contexts: These approaches emphasized the mutual independence between sensing and action and generated interest in solutions to motion planning problems where complete information is available at the time of robot action or decision making. The Piano Movers problem <ref> [1] </ref> was subsequently formulated in order to solve the path planning problem in cases where the environment of the robot was already accurately known.

Reference-contexts: The approach advocates the need for real-time robot control with incomplete information <ref> [5] </ref> or under uncertainty [6], and real-time spatiotemporal processing of the sensor input [7, 8]. In this paper we study the path planning problem under the purposive, act-while-thinking paradigm. <p> would imply that the surface bounding the object is not connected. 6 Example 2.1 (Tactile sensing) If S (c) = fcg for c 2 &lt; 3 V S , the automaton can only determine the three-dimensional coordinates of its current position, an assumption used in the path-planning literature (e.g., see <ref> [5] </ref>). Example 2.2 (Range sensing) If S (c) = fx 2 &lt; 3 jx 2 B (c; r) and x is visible from cg, the sensing mechanism of the automaton corresponds to a range sensor that can determine the coordinates of all visible points within a ball of radius r. <p> Although the target location t may be reachable from s, it may or may not be reachable by a collision-free path on . If s and t are reachable on , one of the known planar path planning algorithms (e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>) will be able to solve this path planning problem. On the other hand, if t is not reachable, the robot must plan its motion by moving outside of (Figure 2). <p> able to sense points belonging to any of these curves using A E , the robot will be able to reach a position on that belongs to the reachability region of t. 3.2 Algorithm A 2D Simply for the sake of specificity we assume that the robot uses algorithm Bug1 <ref> [5] </ref> for solving the two-dimensional motion planning subproblem. This algorithm assumes the robot can determine its three-dimensional coordinates and knows the coordinates of the target location.

Reference-contexts: The algorithms rely on the fact that the obstacles consist of a finite collection of planar faces, and produce paths whose lengths diverge in the limit. For example, the exploration algorithm proposed by Rao <ref> [11] </ref> has a complexity depending on the number of faces in the environment's description. This description, however, becomes infinite when the obstacles are bounded by smooth surfaces. Consequently, exploration becomes an infinitely complex task even when the environment contains geometrically simple surfaces (e.g., a sphere).

Reference-contexts: This description, however, becomes infinite when the obstacles are bounded by smooth surfaces. Consequently, exploration becomes an infinitely complex task even when the environment contains geometrically simple surfaces (e.g., a sphere). On the other hand, previous work in computer vision that addresses the visual exploration problem (e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>) has not formally studied this problem and has not considered issues of correctness or convergence in arbitrary environments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. <p> a camera or a range sensor) for guiding the exploration and the path-planning processes: The first condition leads to strategies where the path planning process is guided by observing the obstacle surfaces from a discrete set of positions and planning the motion of the robot between them (e.g., similar to <ref> [12] </ref>). The second condition leads to the development of strategies that are based on the detection of one-dimensional curves that can "slide" on the surface as the robot moves (e.g., the occlusion boundary [7]).

Reference-contexts: Given M &gt; 0, there is a point t on ^ S such that A plans a path between s and t of length greater than M . This proposition implies that determining whether or not t is reachable is an unsolvable (or undecidable <ref> [13] </ref>) problem since if t is not reachable, the automaton's algorithm will not terminate.
