Reference-contexts: Their set of polynomials, called surface scattering modes, is ordered with respect to angular resolution and automatically respects Helmholtz's reciprocity and (if desired) surface isotropy. The derivation uses the Zernike circle polynomials <ref> [1] </ref> that form a complete basis for functions on the interior of the unit disk. <p> Positive values of l correspond to cosine terms, negative values to sine terms: G l () = cos (l) for l 0 (10) The functions R l n are closely related to Jacobi's polyno mials <ref> [1] </ref> and are given by R l (nl)=2 X (1) s (n s)!t n2s : Helmholtz reciprocity expresses the fact that, in the approximation of geometrical optics, the direction of light rays may be reversed. Therefore, the BRDF does not change when the entrance and exit beams are interchanged.

The calibrated, segmented images serve as the BTF measurements and these images are averaged to obtain the BRDF measurements, as illustrated in Figure 2. The need to vary the viewing and source directions over the entire hemisphere of possible directions presents a practical obstacle in the measurements. <p> Linear estimation was used to fit the truncated series to the BRDF measurements. Plots for the entire set of fitting results are too numerous to include here and are provided in <ref> [4] </ref>. The samples included here were chosen to be representative of the overall results. These samples are 11-plaster, 12-rough paper, 49-concrete, 25-quarry tile, 21-sponge, and 20-styrofoam. The measurements and modeling results are depicted in Figure 7.

Reference-contexts: Our BRDF parameter database, obtained by fitting the measurements to the Oren-Nayar model and the Koenderink et al. decomposition, can be used in place of the popular Lambertian reflectance model in such algorithms as shape-from-shading <ref> [6] </ref> and photometric stereo [21]. Since these algorithms rely on a reflectance model to ascertain shape, inaccuracies of the Lambertian model can significantly affect their performance. The model parameters can also be used instead of popular shading models [5],[2] for photorealistic rendering of real-world surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Our large database allows us to evaluate the performance of known models. Specifically, the measurements are fit to two existing analytical representations: the Oren-Nayar model [13] for surfaces with isotropic roughness and the Koenderink et al. decomposition <ref> [8] </ref> for both anisotropic and isotropic surfaces. Our fitting results form a concise BRDF parameter database that is also publicly available at www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/curet. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. <p> A key benefit of this model is that it has only three unknown parameters: , and k d . 5.2 Koenderink et al. Representation In order to interpolate BRDF data sets, a series development in terms of an orthonormal basis can be used. Koenderink et al. <ref> [8] </ref> have shown how to construct such a complete, orthonormal basis on the Cartesian product of the hemisphere. Their set of polynomials, called surface scattering modes, is ordered with respect to angular resolution and automatically respects Helmholtz's reciprocity and (if desired) surface isotropy. <p> Explicit expressions for H ll 0 nn 0 for order 0 and 1 are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. If the surface under consideration is isotropic, the BRDF depends only on j i r j. This means that in the expansion we need to keep only terms containing cos ( i r ). This greatly reduces the number of basis functions. <p> Explicit expressions for S l nm up to order 2 are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. Note that for both systems, the 0-order term is the BRDF for a perfect Lambertian reflector. The development of the BRDF in Equation 12 can be used for anisotropic samples, while the development in Equation 13 is applicable to isotropic samples.

Reference-contexts: Consequently the corresponding rendered sphere shows a horizontal bright stripe due to speculari-ties. 5 Fitting to BRDF Models A concise description is required for functional utility of the measurements. We employ the Oren-Nayar model [13] and the Koenderink et al. representation <ref> [9] </ref> to obtain parametric descriptions of the BRDF measurement database. The resulting database of parameters can be used directly and conveniently in a variety of algorithms where accurate, concise and analytical reflectance descriptions are needed. In vision, these applications include shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. <p> The differences in the simulated and actual oblique views are readily apparent. Because of the varying surface normals across the sample, foreshortening effects are quite complicated and cannot be accounted for by common texture-mapping techniques. A detailed discussion of the pitfalls of current texture rendering schemes is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider the same sample shown under two different sets of illumination and viewing directions in Figure 9. The corresponding Fourier spectra are also shown in Figure 9. Notice that the spectra are quite different.

Sample 35, a collection of spheres painted with highly specular paint, show a similar flatness due to surface roughness.

Reference-contexts: As illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9, surface roughness causes notable effects on the BTF which are not considered by current texture algorithms. Present algorithms for shape-from-texture [14],[16],[10], texture segmentation [22],[10] and texture recognition <ref> [15] </ref> are only suitable for 2D textures, i.e. planar texture due to albedo variation. Texture rendering also typically assumes a 2D planar texture that is mapped to a 3D surface. When the surface is rough, the rendering tends to be too flat and unrealistic.

Reference-contexts: Notice that interchanging the source and viewing direction does not change the the ratio of radiance (L d ) to irradiance (E 0 cos i ), indicating that this model obeys Helmholtz's reciprocity condition. To account for specular reflection, the Torrance-Sparrow model <ref> [18] </ref> is incorporated so that the total radiance L is given by L ( r ; i ; r i ; ; ) = k d L d + k s L s ; (5) where L s is determined by the Torrance-Sparrow model, k d and k s are the
