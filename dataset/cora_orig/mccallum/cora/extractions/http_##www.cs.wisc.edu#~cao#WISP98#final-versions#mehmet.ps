Abstract: Replication of documents on geographically distributed servers can improve both performance and reliability of the Web service. Server selection algorithms allow Web clients to select one of the replicated servers which is "close" to them and thereby minimize the response time of the Web service. Using client proxy server traces, we compare the effectiveness of several proximity metrics including the number of hops between the client and server, the ping round trip time and the HTTP request latency. Based on this analysis, we design two new algorithms for selection of replicated servers and compare their performance against other existing algorithms. We show that the new server selection algorithms improve the performance of other existing algorithms on the average by 55%. In addition, the new algorithms improve the performance of the existing non-replicated Web servers on average by 69%.

Reference-contexts: As it is shown in Figures 4 and 5, during nighttime the Fixed algorithm outperforms either Ping or Hops, depending on server replication factor. 4.

Caching goes Replication (CgR) [BMS96] and Smart Clients [YCE97] are two mechanisms for replication of HTTP, telnet or ftp services on top of the existing Web infrastructure. Both CgR clients and Smart clients can utilize the server selection mechanisms described in our paper.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the number of hops between a client and a server gives very little indication of the response time that an HTTP server might deliver to the client. Our finding is consistent with that of Crovella and Carter <ref> [CC95] </ref>, who report a similar result. The round trip time of the packets sent by the ping utility [S94] is another common metric for Internet host proximity [CC95, IWR]. <p> Our finding is consistent with that of Crovella and Carter [CC95], who report a similar result. The round trip time of the packets sent by the ping utility [S94] is another common metric for Internet host proximity <ref> [CC95, IWR] </ref>. Unlike the number of hops, the ping round trip time reflects the network load on the route between the client and the server. However, the ping round trip time does not provide any indication of the load and speed of the HTTP server. <p> Fixed: Client sends all requests to a fixed server. This algorithm reflects the current situation on the Web with no server replication. 2. Ping:Client periodically sends a ping request to each server and redirects all HTTP requests to the server with minimal ping round trip time <ref> [CC95] </ref>. 3. Hops: Client sends all requests to a server that has the closest distance from the client in terms of the number of hops [GS95]. 4. Parallel: Client sends parallel requests to all servers replicating the document and waits for the first response. 5. <p> Several algorithms for selection of replicated servers on the Web have been designed [CC95,GS95,GSe95,F97,IWR]. The algorithms are based on the distance in number of hops [GS95,F97], geographic proximity [GSe95] or ping round trip time [IWR]. However, with the exception of <ref> [CC95] </ref>, none of the previous work studies the performance of their algorithms nor compares them with other algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For example, a multi-second response time for downloading a 5 KB document is not unusual. Similarly, the mean time to failure (MTTF) of Internet servers has been measured as 15 days [LMG95] which is significantly below the levels found in other information systems such as database servers <ref> [G90] </ref>. Replication of Web documents can improve both performance and reliability of the Web service. After a server failure, Web clients can still satisfy their requests from another server, which replicates the requested document. Many popular Web sites already employ a replication (mirroring) of their sites.
