Title: Information Sharing and Knowledge Merging in Cooperative Information Systems  
Author: Jinxin Lin 
Address: Toronto, M5S 1A4, Canada  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science University of Toronto  
Abstract: Information sharing is the key issue in cooperative information systems. This issue is studied from a logical point of views in this paper. It is assumed that information in each component system is stored in a knowledge base expressed by a set of logical sentences. A formal method for merging multiple knowledge bases that might conflict each other is presented. The method has a number of interesting properties such as reflecting the views of majority and syntax-independence. It is shown by example that this method appears to resolve conflicts among the knowledge bases in a plausible way, and that the method can be implemented by an efficient syntactical transformation from the set of knowledge bases to be merged.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently there has been much interest in developing cooperative information systems that aim at sharing information among multiple and possibly heterogenous component systems (see, e.g., <ref> [BJe94, HM92, WL92] </ref>). Such component systems range from conventional database systems to more advanced expert systems or knowledge base systems.

Reference-contexts: One simple method for knowledge base merging is to take the disjunction of the maximal consistent subsets of the union of the knowledge bases. This is essentially the approach adopted by Baral et al. <ref> [BKMS92] </ref>. However, such an approach does not take into account the majority view of the knowledge bases. For example, suppose there are three knowledge bases T 1 = fag; T 2 = fag and T 3 = f:ag.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our approach in this paper will produce a, which reflects the view of the majority. Furthermore, our approach is independent of the particular syntax of the knowledge bases to be merged, while the method of Baral et al. is syntax-dependent. Another method is to use majority rule <ref> [Kel88] </ref> to merge knowledge bases, but this can produce contradictory result. For example, let us define that a group of knowledge bases supports a sentence ff if there are more members supporting (implying) ff than members supporting :ff.
