Abstract: Using data gathered over many years, people working in sheet metal fabrication have compiled lists of errors that are frequently made by designers in the field. These errors (or violations) are common to the design of sheet metal components used in a wide variety of products from computer chassis to automobiles. This paper outlines the efforts to use this information to aid in the development of a rule-based design advisor for sheet metal fabrication. The design advisor is a module of Promod-S, a concurrently engineered, application orientated product modeler that is being developed by researchers at the Automation and Robotics Laboratory of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The paper presents algorithms for both the identification and correction of design violations. The correction approach includes methods for updating an entire part after a feature has been modified.

Reference-contexts: A list of these violations, compiled based on years of experience of both designers and manufacturers in the field <ref> [1] </ref>, has been incorporated into the advisor's knowledge base. While violations are general within a specific domain, sheet metal fabrication in the case of ProMod-S, adequate design advice cannot be given without consideration of the tools available to the manufacturer who will eventually produce the component or assembly being designed.

Reference-contexts: Each contour loop and the feature loops it contains form a multiply connected polygon. A multiply connected polygon can be though of as a set of non-intersecting polygons which lie within a larger polygon. Srinivnansan etal. <ref> [13] </ref> developed an O (N (log 2 N + H)) algorithm for computing the Voronoi Diagram of a multiply connected polygonal domain, where N is the number of edges and H is the number of internal polygons.

Reference-contexts: This problem of saving a design history and the more complicated problem of saving design intent are important issues being investigated by many researchers <ref> [14] </ref>. One question that arises quite naturally is: "How much of a history should be saved by a designer system?".
