Reference-contexts: integer. (You have to insert a call to __RmPointer ( pointer ) into the routines that destroy the pointer.) The routines for managing the pointers are in `ptrcvt.c'. -mnative Multiple indirects (int *** are native datatypes; that is, there is no coercion to the basic type). -mpi Recognize special MPI <ref> [1] </ref> datatypes (some MPI datatypes are pointers by definition). -ptrprefix name Change the prefix for names of functions to convert to/from pointers. The default value of name is __. -voidisptr Consider void * as a pointer to a structure. -ansiheader Generate ANSI-C style headers instead of Fortran interfaces.
