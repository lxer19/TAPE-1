Abstract: Browsing is an interactive and exploratory process for information retrieval that has advantages over search term queries in many situations. Most browsers represent a concept space as a nested, indented tree structure or a hypertext document, but the problem is that users feel `lost in concept space' in that they have a poor sense of where they are, where they want to go, and how to get there. Many systems attempt to rectify this by displaying the underlying hypertext directed graph, but this often results in a tangled web that is not helpful to the user. Space-filling methods, on the other hand, focus more on concepts and make the relationships (links) more implicit. Topographical cues such as size, color, and location can be employed more effectively in space-filling display methods than in structure display methods. This paper investigates a list of tasks that users should be able to accomplish within a concept space, discusses data structure representations of the concept space that are required for performing these tasks, and then evaluates and classifies a variety of existing browsing methods according to their abilities to perform the enumerated tasks.

Reference-contexts: One is left to guess that he is merely expanding and contracting branches of a tree because his example uses a tree hierarchy. For directed graphs, particularly in hypertext structures, there are methods for creating aggregates of nodes by looking at biconnected and strongly connected components of the graph <ref> [BS91] </ref>. 14 Peter Gloor expands on the idea of consolidating nodes and links with some interesting ideas but a rather disappointing implementation in his CY-BERMAP tool [Glo94] (see Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: Besides, the maze representation does not seem to have much more of an advantage over graph representations. 4.1.3 Aggregation While there are algorithms for converting hypertext digraphs into trees <ref> [BSR92] </ref>, the order of the links may be semantically different from what the author intended. We consider methods that scale down the original structure without modifying the link order.

Reference-contexts: The challenge is to display a meaningful abridgment of the textual and pictorial concepts of the concept space and to allow access to details by some method that does not disorient the user from the global context. Beard and Walker have empirical results to argue strongly for an overview. <ref> [BW90] </ref> The methods described below use scrolling, panning, 9 roaming, zooming, and distortion to achieve this. Another problem is that concept spaces lack a geographical topology. Visualization requires mapping a high-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional or three-dimensional display.

Reference-contexts: Initially only the top level of the TOC tree hierarchy is displayed. The user can expand and contract individual branches of the tree in the space of the parent node. This method is superior to the static view of the entire table of contents, as demonstrated in experiments <ref> [CS94] </ref>. Another table of contents browser that has been implemented is the multipane interface. Here local views are displayed in window panes separate from the global view pane.

Reference-contexts: non-planar, which means that any layout that prevents edge crossings is impossible to draw in a plane. "For richly interconnected material or documents of a reasonable size and complexity, it is not possible to include everything in a single browser without the problem of presenting `visual spaghetti' to the user." <ref> [Dil90] </ref> 4.1 Structure Display Methods 4.1.1 Outliners: The Oldest Trick in the Book A text outline widget is a window pane that allows the user to dynamically interact with a table of contents. Initially only the top level of the TOC tree hierarchy is displayed.

Reference-contexts: The network display is not very effective when the number of nodes is large because too much information gets absorbed in each hyperdrawer. 15 Interactive Graphical Documents (IGD) <ref> [Fei88] </ref> is a system that deals with the tangled web problem by assisting the user in converting an existing hypertext structure into a tree where the pages of the original document are the leaf nodes and internal nodes, or chapters, are created to subsume the pages, and metachapters are created to

Reference-contexts: The tree nodes are too small to contain much text. The current implementation does not use visual information cues such as color and size. But these changes probably would not contribute much because of the waste of screen space. SemNet <ref> [FF88] </ref> displays the directed graph structure of an information space in three dimensions and gives the user the ability to translate, rotate and zoom in three-space with a mouse in real-time. Sizes of nodes are scaled according to their distances from the camera.

Reference-contexts: Clicking on a linked item jumps to the desired notecard. Most hypertext systems require an author to design the node-link structure of a document beforehand, but 2 there are some systems that automate this process given a linear document, the Hypertext Medical Handbook being one of them <ref> [Fri87] </ref>. Thus, methods that display a hypertext structure can, in some sense, apply to all kinds of documents.

Reference-contexts: A fisheye view display simulates this effect. "The fundamental motivation of a fisheye strategy is to provide a balance of local detail and global context." <ref> [Fur86] </ref> Sarkar and Brown experimented with graphical fisheye views of graphs and maps 18 [SB92] (see Figure 6). Instead of zooming into regions of a graph or map that are too large to fit on one screen, the user can view local regions in detail under a magnifying glass.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the user browses a node's children to search through contents and a node's parents to search through contexts. Furnas has implemented a browser for a family genealogy multitree <ref> [Fur94] </ref>. A network is a directed graph. Links can exist between any two nodes. This provides freedom to express a greater variety of relationships between concepts than trees, but can lead to chaos because relationships can be ambiguous and edge crossings can occur. <p> The ability to select among contexts from parent nodes has important ramifications for browsing. For one thing, the same node can be viewed differently depending on its context. In fact, Furnas has implemented a multitree browser that is somewhat analogous to Kumar's tree browser <ref> [Fur94] </ref>. His browser looks like a tied knot with the single node in focus at the center of the screen with the ancestor tree extending to the left and the descendant tree to the right.

Reference-contexts: graphs, particularly in hypertext structures, there are methods for creating aggregates of nodes by looking at biconnected and strongly connected components of the graph [BS91]. 14 Peter Gloor expands on the idea of consolidating nodes and links with some interesting ideas but a rather disappointing implementation in his CY-BERMAP tool <ref> [Glo94] </ref> (see Figure 2). CYBERMAP ignores the original node-link structure of a hypertext document and instead generates new nodes and links based on indexing techniques that represent articles of the document as keyword vectors. It first partitions the information space into clusters based on the relative similarities of articles.

Reference-contexts: Users also performed better with the multipane 10 interface. 4.1.2 Drawing the Node-Link Diagram The "tree browser" is an implementation by Harsha Kumar of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland for manipulating trees. <ref> [Kum94] </ref> It displays a node-link representation of a tree with scroll bars for panning parts of the tree that do not fit on the screen. A miniature version of the entire tree is shown to the left of the main display acting as an overview map.

Reference-contexts: In general, the greater the disparity between bounding box aspect ratios, the worse treemaps perform. Xia Lin uses Kohonen's feature map algorithm to organize the information space for a space-filling overview layout <ref> [Lin93] </ref> (see Figure 5). Here the entire screen is utilized to display what he calls a semantic map of labeled concept areas of size proportional to the density of the keyword concept.

Reference-contexts: The user can dynamically filter out nodes and links by using two-way sliders. There is a tight-coupling between actions in the main the display and in the overview map. The Hyperbolic Browser is another tool for visualizing trees in 2D <ref> [LRP95] </ref>. The tree is laid out in the hyperbolic plane and then projected onto a circular region. By a property of the hyperbolic plane, exponentially more space is available with increasing distance from the radius of the circle.

Reference-contexts: The ... flexibility of reading on screen is disorienting for a user who can't conceptualise an overview of the system." <ref> [McA87] </ref> A solution to this problem may be to provide visual cues for the user to develop a cognitive map, or overview, of the information space. Maps allow people to navigate through a big environment by helping them abstract routes and paths they have not encountered before. <p> We consider methods that scale down the original structure without modifying the link order. Because "subjects need what can be called `terrain' knowledge in addition to `street' knowledge," <ref> [McA87] </ref> Ray McAleese displays both a regular-sized version of the graph in a window with horizontal and vertical scroll bars and, alongside it, a scaled-down version of the original graph for an overview.

Reference-contexts: In observing that one can gain insight into the organization, size, depth, and detail of a book just by flipping through it, Manber and Lai implemented a prototype to allow users to fly through a hypertext document <ref> [ML91] </ref>. The hope is that a brief guided tour will orient the user within a hypertext framework. This is consistent with the kind of browsing one might do in a library.

Reference-contexts: These queries are most appropriate on trees because of the way the tree hierarchy aggregates nodes from general to specific, but there are analogs for graphs. Perhaps an algorithm can be used to impose a hierarchy on a graph. <ref> [RBS94] </ref> It is sometimes useful to get a local view of a given region by seeing neighboring concepts of the query term. In a tree this includes the siblings of a given node and possibly some of its cousins and uncles. <p> Another drawback is that it does not support the conversion of an existing document into a tree structure an author must use a display direct manipulation editor to write a new tree-structured document. There are, however, algorithms that can automate this process with some success <ref> [RBS94] </ref>. 4.2 Space-Filling Display Methods Because "a pixel is a terrible thing to waste," the following methods attempt to pack detailed overview maps of a document space onto one screen.

Reference-contexts: Fisheye views can be beneficial when applied to some domains. But for graphical views, the distorted geometry produced by fisheye transforms looks unnatural and can be very disorienting. The Galaxy of News <ref> [Ren94] </ref> is a tool for browsing a database of newspaper articles. It initially displays a global overview of the information space as keywords from the articles that were considered the most general and important by some parsing algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This allows for a smooth animation sequence to indicate a new node coming into focus. Multitrees are particularly well suited for when fragments of a tree hierarchy are reused in other hierarchies. However, fragments composed in one context may not work well in another context. Cone trees <ref> [RMC91] </ref> (see Figure 3) offer a way to view a tree structure as a three-dimensional vertical (or horizontal) tree from top to bottom with uniform spacing between levels. Child nodes hang off their parent in a cone formation that resembles a Christmas tree.

[Fur86] Sarkar and Brown experimented with graphical fisheye views of graphs and maps 18 <ref> [SB92] </ref> (see Figure 6).

Reference-contexts: The main strength of treemaps is that they provide access to detail while preserving the global context. No scrolling, panning, or zooming is needed. "The number of nodes that can be displayed by a treemap can be an order of magnitude greater than traditional graphical tree diagrams." <ref> [TJ92] </ref> But treemaps have some limitations. For trees with many levels, displaying the entire contents at once can overload and disorient the user. Lower- levels become too small to reveal any content information.
