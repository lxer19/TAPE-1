Abstract: With the explosive growth of the internet, autonomous agents will increasingly need strategies for efficiently retrieving information. The time an agent (or server) takes to answer a query issued to it is often a random variable, whose distribution can be estimated by collecting statistics. When an agent A sends a query to another agent B and the query has not completed in some period of time, agent A faces the dilemma of whether to continue waiting or reissue the query (to agent B or to a different one). When some information is available about the probability distribution of the query completion time of the agents, it is possible to devise schemes for agents to reissue queries in such a way that the expected query completion time is reduced significantly. We design such schemes for various models of query-answering agents. Where meaningful, we take into account the cost of sending a query to an agent.

Reference-contexts: We also establish necessary conditions for the existence of a locally optimum restart time. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of future research directions. The proofs of all our results appear in the technical report version of our paper <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Two-valued discrete distribution Throughout this paper we will have in mind the following scenario. An agent A needs a certain query answered, and it has one or more specialized agents available to answer it.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we consider strategies for aborting a query while it is being handled by an agent, and re-issuing it to the same or another agent. In <ref> [2] </ref>, Huberman, Lukose and Hogg consider specifically the problem of restarting web-site queries. They briefly mention the possibility of collecting statistics of web-site access times, and mention that it is possible to devise restart strategies to reduce the expectation and variance of the access time.

Reference-contexts: It is common in the multi-agent literature to use contracts <ref> [7, 3, 6] </ref> as a model for agents delegating tasks to other agents. For example if an agent A delegates an information-retrieval task to agent B, the two agents enter into a contract: agent A agrees to pay agent B a certain fee for B's services.

Reference-contexts: In [2], Huberman, Lukose and Hogg consider specifically the problem of restarting web-site queries. They briefly mention the possibility of collecting statistics of web-site access times, and mention that it is possible to devise restart strategies to reduce the expectation and variance of the access time. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Lukose and Huberman carry out an analysis of restart strategies under a model very similar to ours.

Reference-contexts: Since some of the same issues arise in the case of agents, we briefly describe this work. For instance, Etzioni et. al. <ref> [5] </ref> consider a model where each web site charges a certain fee to answer a query, and has a deterministic completion time with a certain probability of successfully answering the query.

Reference-contexts: For instance the querying agent may be allowed to abort the query (and perhaps send it to another agent) if the query-answering agent takes more than some agreed upon time to answer a query. Such flexible contracts have been shown to have several benefits <ref> [8] </ref>. Prior work in this area has not explicitly considered strategies for how best to take advantage of this type of decommitment flexibility. The present paper shows strategies for agents to use this flexibility, and how the results depend on the underlying distribution of query completion times.

Reference-contexts: Most current work on multi-agent contracts considers contracts as binding. There has been a growing interest in contingent contracts <ref> [9] </ref>, which can offer each party several agreed-upon flexibilities. For instance the querying agent may be allowed to abort the query (and perhaps send it to another agent) if the query-answering agent takes more than some agreed upon time to answer a query.
