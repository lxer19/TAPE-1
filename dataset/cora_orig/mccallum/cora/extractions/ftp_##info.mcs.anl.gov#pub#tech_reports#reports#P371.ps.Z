Abstract: The recent discovery of certain ceramic materials that turns into superconduc-tors at relatively high temperatures has stimulated much activities in the subject area. We strongly believe that mathematics can play a significant role by helping physicists to understand the basic theory of the phenomenon, by testing existing models with numerical simulation, and by suggesting modifications of the models. Since the original discovery of superconductivity by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, theoretical physicists have proposed several models to explain the phenomena. The first successful one was given by the brothers F. and H. London. In 1950, Ginzburg and Landau suggested to explain superconductivity as a new type of phase transition. They hypothesized that the global minimizer of the Helmholtz energy, calculated from an order parameter and a vector potential, determines the electromagnetic state of the material. The energy functional contains coefficients that depend on the temperature, in such a way that below the critical temperature, a bifurcation occurs and a new branch of solutions takes over as the minimizer. Applying the calculus of variation to the energy functional yields the fl Present address: Department of Mathematics, University of Southwestern Louisiana,

Reference-contexts: Numerical simulations of (10)-(11) have been performed which seem to indicate their well-posedness [3]. Their most intriguing feature from the present point of view however, is their ability to reduce formally to the classical and modified Stefan models as a, and in some cases ff tend to zero <ref> [2] </ref>. We aim here to perform a similar analysis of the superconductivity problem. We first introduce the Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity, in which the phase boundary is smoothed as in the phase field model.

Reference-contexts: In the superconducting region we find H (0) = 0, and f (0) = 1. It remains to consider a local analysis of a transition layer between two such regions. When local coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the transition region are introduced, as in <ref> [4] </ref> we find that the leading order solution corresponds to a stationary, one-dimensional transition, providing the velocity and curvature of the `interface' are not too large.

Reference-contexts: A common observation for type II superconductors is that the normal regions form `cores' of size comparable to the thickness of a domain boundary <ref> [12] </ref>. In such a situation the preceding asymptotic analysis, and therefore the free-boundary model, is not valid.

In the superconductivity problem this corresponds to j Hj&gt; H c in the normal region. If either of these conditions is violated the model is ill-posed and thus needs to be regularised [8].

Reference-contexts: In the superconductivity problem this corresponds to j Hj&gt; H c in the normal region. If either of these conditions is violated the model is ill-posed and thus needs to be regularised [8]. A popular way of doing this is to include surface tension (Gibbs-Thompson) and/or kinetic undercooling effects <ref> [19] </ref> so that T m is not constant, but given by T m = oe~ fiv n ; (1:8) where ~ is the mean curvature of the interface, with a suitable sign, and oe and fi are positive constants; oe is known as the surface energy.
