Abstract: We study the broadcasting of messages in tree networks under edge reductions. When an edge is reduced, its cost becomes zero. Edge reductions model the decrease or elimination of broadcasting costs between adjacent nodes in the network. Let T be an n-vertex tree and B be a target broadcast cost. We present an O(n) time algorithm for determining the minimum number of edges of T to reduce so that a broadcast cost of B can be achieved. We present an O(n log n) time algorithm to determine the minimum number of edges to reduce so that a broadcast initiated at an arbitrary vertex of T costs at most B. Characterizations of where edge reductions are placed underly both algorithms and imply that reduced edges can be centrally located. fl Research supported in part by DARPA under contract DABT63-92-C-0022ONR.

Reference-contexts: Transmitting the message can be viewed as making a telephone call and as blocking the communication abilities for both the sender and receiver. The blocking communication model has been studied extensively extensively from a theoretical point of view [6, 7, 9, 14] and it underlies numerous broadcast algorithms <ref> [1, 2, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. In this paper we study broadcasting in tree networks under edge reductions for blocking communication. Edge reductions model the decrease or elimination of broadcasting costs between adjacent nodes of the network.

The vertices at which initiating a broadcast costs B Min (T ) represent the center set and they form a star consisting of at least 2 vertices. In [14] it is also shown that the value of 2 B Arb (T ) is the sum of B Min (T ) and the longest path length to a vertex in the center set. Assume we are given a tree T and a target broadcast cost B. <p> This implies that when edge reductions correspond to fast communication links, such links can be centrally located. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the O (n) time algorithm for determining B Min (T ) described in <ref> [14] </ref>. Our edge reduction algorithms make use of this algorithm in a preprocessing step and work with the broadcast entries it generates. In Section 3 we first develop characterizations of where the edge reductions are placed in an optimal reduction for Br Min. <p> The edge reduction algorithm for problem Br Arb is presented in Section 4.2. The data structures achieving the O (n log n) time bound are described in Section 4.3. Section 5 concludes. 2 Review of the O (n) algorithm for Br Min The algorithm described in <ref> [14] </ref> solves problem Br Min in O (n) time by performing a sweep through T which starts at the leaves. Our algorithms for Br Min and Br Arb under edge reductions use this algorithm as a preprocessing step and uses the entries it generates. <p> Our algorithms for Br Min and Br Arb under edge reductions use this algorithm as a preprocessing step and uses the entries it generates. For completeness sake, we describe the algorithm given in <ref> [14] </ref>. In order to avoid confusion, we refer to this algorithm as Algorithm CF (CF for center finding). Algorithm CF generates the following: 1. Algorithm CF roots tree T at some vertex, say vertex c. <p> Initiating a broadcast at c 1 ; : : : ; c s or c results in a broadcast cost of b (c) and C = fc; c 1 ; : : : ; c s g. We refer to <ref> [14] </ref> for the details on how to implement Algorithm CF in O (n) time. Vertex c is the root of the rooted version of tree T . Throughout the paper, if not stated otherwise, we assume that T is rooted at c. <p> Recall the cost of a tree T in Br Arb: B Arb (T ) = max 1in fB i g, where B i is the cost of completing a broadcast initiated at vertex i. Slater et al. show in <ref> [14] </ref> that for trees with unary weights B i = d (i; c i ) + B Min (T ), where d (i; c i ) is the length of the path from i to c i and c i is the vertex in center set C closest to vertex i.
