Abstract: Speculative execution as a means for increasing performance of single instruction streams has introduced the need for the best branch prediction accuracy possible. We compare nine variations of Two-level branch prediction due to [1], by varying the amount of history information kept. We also analyze the distribution of the mispre-dictons in our best prediction scheme. We then present our results of implementing a predictor that gives a still higher accuracy.
