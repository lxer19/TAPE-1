Abstract: We present new results in axiomatic group theory obtained by using automated deduction programs. The results include single axioms, some with the identity and others without, for groups of exponents 3, 4, 5, and 7, and a general form for single axioms for groups of odd exponent. The results were obtained by using the programs in three separate ways: as a symbolic calculator, to search for proofs, and to search for counterexamples. We also touch on relations between logic programming and automated reasoning.

Reference-contexts: We have also found single axioms, containing the identity, for exponents 2 and 4 and for odd n, 3 n 17. We made extensive use of three types of symbolic computation in discovering the axioms. First, the automated deduction program Otter <ref> [1, 2] </ref> was used as a symbolic calculator, fl This work was supported by the Applied Mathematical Sciences subprogram of the Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy, under Contract W-31-109-Eng-38. performing strictly algorithmic deductions, to generate sets of candidate single axioms.

Reference-contexts: Several of the methods we used are based on recent work in which single axioms were discovered for the left group and right group calculi <ref> [3] </ref> and for several axiomatizations of ordinary groups and Abelian groups [4]. 2 Axiomatizations of Exponent Groups Throughout the paper, e is the group identity, (x y) is product, x 1 is inverse, and x n is right-associated.

Reference-contexts: The axioms it produces are very long, they contain inverse, and they do not contain the identity. We sought shorter axioms without inverse, some without and others with identity. When we started the study, we knew of simple single axioms for Boolean groups <ref> [4] </ref>. Since then, we have found many single axioms, not containing the identity, for exponents 3, 5, and 7, and a general form for groups of odd exponent. We have also found single axioms, containing the identity, for exponents 2 and 4 and for odd n, 3 n 17. <p> Several of the methods we used are based on recent work in which single axioms were discovered for the left group and right group calculi [3] and for several axiomatizations of ordinary groups and Abelian groups <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 Axiomatizations of Exponent Groups Throughout the paper, e is the group identity, (x y) is product, x 1 is inverse, and x n is right-associated. <p> Most of our useful assistance from Finder was with jobs of less than one minute, finding models of less than five elements. 4 Results 4.1 Single Axioms without the Identity For groups with exponent 2, we already knew short single axioms <ref> [4] </ref>, for example, ((x y) z) (x z) = y. (4.1) In contrast to (4.1), the axiom produced by B. H. Neumann's general form contains 14 occurrences of product and 9 occurrences of inverse, and we have not been able to verify it with Otter.

Reference-contexts: The limit for each case was typically determined by experimentation. * We used the ratio strategy <ref> [5] </ref>, which combines best-first search and breadth-first search, for selecting the next equality for application of paramodulation. * Denials of the associativity, identity, and exponent properties were input, but they did not participate in the searches.

Reference-contexts: Groups of exponent 2, xx = e, are also called Boolean groups. A single axiom for an equational theory is an equality from which the entire theory can be derived by equational reasoning. We are concerned with single axioms for groups of exponent n, n 2. B. H. Neumann <ref> [6, p.83] </ref> gives a general form for single axioms for certain subvarieties of groups, including exponent groups. The axioms it produces are very long, they contain inverse, and they do not contain the identity. We sought shorter axioms without inverse, some without and others with identity. <p> for even exponents. 4.2 Single Axioms with Identity Our main reason for seeking single axioms with the identity for exponent groups is that in the case of ordinary groups, single axioms exist in terms of product and inverse, but no single axioms exist in terms of product, inverse, and identity <ref> [6] </ref>. We believe also that axioms with identity are more natural and appealing. For exponent 2, we easily found many single axioms with one occurrence of the identity e by considering simple transformations of known single axioms without e.

Reference-contexts: We consider such use to be a type of logic programming. Second, Otter also played its traditional role as a theorem prover, to attempt to show that candidates are in fact single axioms. Third, the program Finder <ref> [7] </ref> was used to search for counterexamples, to show that candidates are not single axioms. The first two types of computation listed above illustrate our view on the relationships between logic programming and automated reasoning [8]. <p> When working on a particular type of candidate, we ran individual Otter jobs, carefully tuning the strategy. In contrast, with a set of, say, 1000 candidates we would fix the strategy and automatically run a sequence of 1000 Otter searches, each with a small time limit. Finder <ref> [7] </ref> is a program that searches for models of sets of first-order clauses. Given a candidate, if Finder produces a model violating a group property or the exponent property, the candidate is not a single axiom.

The first two types of computation listed above illustrate our view on the relationships between logic programming and automated reasoning <ref> [8] </ref>. Although the theoretical foundations of the two areas are closely related and the implementation methods can be similar, practical applications are usually far apart, with logic programming relying on algorithmic deduction, and automated reasoning on less-focused search.
