Title: Benchmarking Active Database Systems: A Requirement Analysis  
Author: Jurgen Zimmermann Alejandro P. Buchmann 
Abstract: This extended abstract describes an approach to the definition of benchmarks for active DBMSs. The goal of benchmarking an active DBMS is not only performance comparison, but also identification of missing functionalities. The chosen performance measure is a) response time for event detection, rule firing, and rule administration and b) database size for both garbage collection of semi-composed events and looking up rules to be fired. In addition the importance of event parameters is examined with respect to rules for consistency repairs and value-based access control.

Reference-contexts: Examples include the checking of consistency constraints and of value-based access control rules. However, passing event parameters to the condition and action slows down the performance of an aDBMS. If a triggered rule is executed in an immediate coupling mode (see [DBB+88] and <ref> [BBK93] </ref> for the definition of coupling modes) it is sufficient to pass pointers to the parameters.

At the Technical University of Darmstadt such a benchmark will be implemented for our active DBMS REACH <ref> [BZBW95] </ref>. The implementation of this benchmark has two distinct goals: to help us in identifying performance bottlenecks in our own aDBMS and to create a level playing-field for comparison of aDBMSs.

Reference-contexts: In a benchmark for object-oriented DBMSs like OO1 <ref> [Catt93] </ref> the main interest is concentrated on objects which require the existence of only a few classes. A benchmark for aDBMSs has to focus on rules which are part of the DB schema and especially their event definition.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation Active database management systems (aDBMS) typically provide a rule subsystem in order to incorporate more application semantics in the database itself (see [DHW95]). Using Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules as defined in <ref> [DBB+88] </ref> a programmer or database administrator can specify which action should be executed when a specified event occurs and a given condition holds, e.g. a rule for the power plant domain might be: RULE waterlevel EVENT update waterlevel of the river COND waterlevel of the river is too low and water <p> Examples include the checking of consistency constraints and of value-based access control rules.
