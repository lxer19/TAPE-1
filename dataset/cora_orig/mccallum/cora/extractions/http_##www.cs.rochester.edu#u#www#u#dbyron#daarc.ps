Reference-contexts: Such antecedents present a problem for language understanding systems, which typically depend on searching a set of discourse entities previously mentioned in NP's (the system's representation of discourse context <ref> [All95, Kar76] </ref>), for candidate antecedents. Although a large body of research exists on the general problem of finding pronoun antecedents, there is little work that deals specifically with demonstrative anaphora. Notable exceptions are the work of Webber [Web88, Web90] and Pas-sonneau [Pas89, Pas93].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Anaphoric reference occurs extensively in task-oriented dialog, but finding the antecedent of anaphora has long been recognized as a difficult problem, requiring a huge amount of semantic and pragmatic knowledge [CB88]. Computational Linguistics research on the resolution of third person pronouns focuses on definite pronouns it/them/they <ref> [Rei84, DI90, GJW95, Azz96] </ref>, however, in the TRAINS93 dialog corpus [HA95], fully 41% of third-person pronominal references are demonstrative that's. How might a language understanding system be constructed to find the antecedent of these referring expressions? It is obviously too wide-spread a phenomenon to simply ignore.

Reference-contexts: demonstrative reference resolution. 2 Related work Work in theoretical linguistics claims that anaphoric that is used not only to cospecify clausal or sentential arguments but also in cases when the antecedent is a composite entity with conflicting semantic features and the speaker is unable to quickly determine the appropriate pronoun <ref> [Cha80] </ref>. The more complicated the antecedent or its surrounding context, the more likely it is to be replaced by that and the less acceptable other pronouns become.

Reference-contexts: Only discourse segments on the `right frontier' of the discourse structure tree are available for anaphoric reference. Passonneau's research characterizes the difference between it and that in a corpus of career-counseling interviews. She framed her findings in terms of the centering model of discourse coherence <ref> [GJW83, GJW95] </ref>, because she found a correlation between the choice of pronoun and center shift or retention. She discovered two major patterns. When both the pronoun and its antecedent were subjects of their respective clauses, it is preferred over that, otherwise that is preferred over it.

Reference-contexts: She discovered two major patterns. When both the pronoun and its antecedent were subjects of their respective clauses, it is preferred over that, otherwise that is preferred over it. This is similar to the structural parallelism phenomenon demonstrated by Kameyama <ref> [Kam86] </ref>. Second, if the antecedent was either a single-word NP or a multi-word NP which was more noun-like than clause-like, it is preferred over that.

Reference-contexts: How might a language understanding system be constructed to find the antecedent of these referring expressions? It is obviously too wide-spread a phenomenon to simply ignore. Sidner <ref> [Sid83] </ref> points out that the role of demonstrative pronouns as definite anaphora has received little treatment in any literature and that a theory to explain it is badly needed.

Reference-contexts: Once the characteristics of antecedents of that anaphora in the annotated dialogs have been fully analyzed, we will give a preliminary account of the processes needed for a language understanding system to resolve demonstrative anaphora. Webber <ref> [Web79] </ref> breaks the task of anaphora resolution into two parts: identifying what a text potentially makes available for anaphoric reference and constraining the candidate set of a given anaphoric expression down to one possible choice.
