Abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of controlled synchronization as a regulator problem. In controlled synchronization one is given autonomous transmitter dynamics and controlled receiver dynamics. The question is to find a (output) feedback controller that achieves matching between transmitter and controlled receiver. Several variants of the problem where the standard solvability assumptions for the regulator problem are not met turn out to have a solution. Simulations on two standard synchronization examples are also included.

Reference-contexts: For the parameter values ff = 15:6, m 0 = 8 7 , m 1 = 5 this system is known to have a so called double scroll chaotic attractor, in which three unstable equilibrium points are embedded (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). We assume that y = w 1 is the transmitted signal, so that (12) takes the form (9). Note that with this choice of y the pair (C; A) is observable. <p> Thus, the system (14) does not satisfy the hypotheses in ([3]). Further, it is well known (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) that this system has a limit cycle C that is attracting for all initial points w (0) 2 IR 2 f0g. Consider a solution ( ~w 1 (t); ~w 2 (t)) that starts on C, and let T denote its period.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that synchronization will only occur in particular cases. In a previous paper, <ref> [11] </ref>, it was shown that an interpretation is to view (2) as an observer for (1) given the output signal OE (w). So in those applications where one is able to design (2) freely, this provides a potential solution for the synchronization problem.

Reference-contexts: So in those applications where one is able to design (2) freely, this provides a potential solution for the synchronization problem. In most of the synchronization literature (see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>) however, the systems (1) and (2) are systems that are given beforehand, so that no synchronization will occur in general.
