Title: Nearest Neighbors Query Performance for Unstable Distributions  
Author: Uri Shaft Jonathan Goldstein Kevin Beyer 
Date: October 7, 1998  
Abstract: This technical report supplements our results about the instability of some data and query distributions in high dimensions. We show that under very common conditions, if the data and query distributions are not stable, any index structure that uses convex shapes as summary of data points will perform badly. The report uses many of the conventions and terminology described in [1]. It also relies on the main result in [1]. It is recommended to be familiar with [1] before reading this report.

Reference-contexts: 1 Instability Theorem This section repeats the main definitions and claims in <ref> [1] </ref> without the proofs. Definition 1 A nearest neighbor query is unstable for a given " if the distance from the query point to most data points is less than (1 + ") times the distance from the query point to its nearest neighbor.
