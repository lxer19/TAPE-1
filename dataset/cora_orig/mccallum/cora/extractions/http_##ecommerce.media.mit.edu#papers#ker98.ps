Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Software agents help automate a variety of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. This paper surveys several of these agent-mediated electronic commerce systems by describing their roles in the context of a Consumer Buying Behavior (CBB) model. The CBB model we present augments traditional marketing models with concepts from Software Agents research to accommodate electronic markets. We then discuss the variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques that support agent mediation and conclude with future directions of agent-mediated electronic commerce research.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Software agents are programs to which one can delegate (aspects of) a task. They differ from traditional software in that they are personalized, continuously running and semi-autonomous. These qualities make agents useful for a wide variety of information and process management tasks <ref> [1] </ref>. It should come as no surprise that these same qualities are particularly useful for the information-rich and process-rich environ ment of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce encompasses a broad range of issues including security, trust, reputation, law, payment mechanisms, advertising, ontologies, on-line catalogs, intermediaries, multimedia shopping experiences, and back-office management.

Reference-contexts: Software agents will play an increasing variety of roles as mediators in electronic commerce <ref> [2] </ref>. This paper explores these roles, their supporting technologies, and how they relate to electronic commerce in its three main forms: business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer transactions (with an emphasis on the latter two). 2.

Reference-contexts: Although CBB research covers many areas, it is important to recognize its limitations upfront. For example, CBB research focuses primarily on retail markets (although many CBB concepts pertain to business-to-business and consumer-to-consumer markets as well) <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Even within retail, not all shopping behaviors are captured (e.g., impulse purchasing). Also, as mentioned earlier, electronic commerce covers a broad range of issues, some of which are beyond the scope of a CBB model (e.g., back-office management and other merchant issues).

Consumer Buying Behavior Model There are several descriptive theories and models that attempt to capture consumer buying behavior e.g., the Nicosia model <ref> [5] </ref>, the Howard-Sheth model [6], the Engel-Blackwell model [7], the Bettman information-processing model [8], and the Andreasen model [9]. Although different, these models all share a similar list of six fundamental stages guiding consumer buying behavior. <p> This includes the evaluation of merchant alternatives based on consumer-selected criteria (e.g., price, warranty, availability, delivery time, reputation, etc.). The Nicosia model merges both brokering stages into one Search Evaluation stage <ref> [5] </ref>. The Engel-Blackwell model dissects these two stages orthogonally into Information Search Evaluation of Alternatives stages [7]. 4. Negotiation This stage is about to determine the terms of the transaction. Negotiation varies in duration and complexity depending on the market. <p> Traditional CBB models do not identify this stage explicitly, but the conclusion of the Negotiation stage is comparable to the Choice Decision stage found in other models <ref> [5, 7] </ref>. 5. Purchase and Delivery The purchase and delivery of a product can either signal the termination of the negotiation stage or occur sometime afterwards (in either order). In some cases, the available payment options (e.g., cash only) or delivery options may inuence prod uct and merchant brokering. 6.

This technique is not perfect, but boasts a nearly 50% success rate in navigating random Internet resources [44]. Firey uses a collaborative-based filtering technology <ref> [14, 45] </ref> to recommend products to consumers. Systems using collaborative techniques use feedback and ratings from different consumers to filter out irrelevant information. These systems do not attempt to analyze or understand the features or the descriptions of the products.

Merchant Brokering Whereas the Product Brokering stage compares product alternatives, the Merchant Brokering stage com pares merchant alternatives. Andersen Consultings BargainFinder was the first shopping agent for on-line price comparisons <ref> [15] </ref>. Given a specific product, BargainFinder requests its price from each of nine different merchant Web sites using the same request as from a Web browser. Although a limited proof-of-concept system, Bargain-Finder offers valuable insights into the issues involved in price comparisons in the on-line world.

Reference-contexts: However, it was also the case that Andersen Consulting received requests from an equal number of little-known mer chants who wanted to be included in BargainFinders price comparison. In short, companies competing on price and/or desiring more exposure wanted to be included, the others didnt. Jango <ref> [16, 17] </ref> can be viewed as an advanced Bar-gainFinder. The original Jango version solved the merchant blocking issue by having the product requests originate from each consumers Web browser instead of from a central site as in BargainFinder.

Reference-contexts: Jangos modus operandi is simple: once a shopper has identified a specific product, Jango can simultaneously query merchant sites (from a list now maintained by Excite, Inc.) for its price. These results allow a consumer to compare merchant offerings on price. The MIT Media Labs Kasbah <ref> [18, 19] </ref> is an on-line, multiagent classified ad system. A user wanting to buy or sell a good creates an agent, gives it some strategic direction, and sends it off into a centralized agent marketplace. <p> The simplicity of these negotiation heuristics makes it intuitive for users to understand what their agents are doing in the mar ketplace. This was important for user acceptance as observed in a recent Media Lab experiment <ref> [18] </ref>. A 1. Like the term agent, there is no consensus on the definition of the term negotiation.

Tete-a-Tete [30, 31] provides a unique negotiation approach to retail sales. Unlike most other on-line negotiation systems which competitively negotiate over price, Tete-a-Tete agents cooperatively negotiate across multiple terms of a transaction e.g., warranties, delivery times, service contracts, return policies, loan options, gift services, and other merchant value-added services.

Auction-Bot users create new auctions to sell products by choosing from a selection of auction types and then specifying its parameters (e.g., clearing times, method for resolving bidding ties, the number of sellers permitted, etc.). <p> For example, the Persuader intermediary system combined multi-attribute utility theory and case-based reasoning to identify a mutually optimal deal during labor relation negotiations [56, 57]. More recent MAS work in market-based systems (e.g., AuctionBot <ref> [23] </ref>), on the other hand, assumes total self-interest and a high degree of competition among agents during negotiations for lim ited resources [58]. Much of the work in agent-mediated negotiations can be traced back to the Contract Net [59].
