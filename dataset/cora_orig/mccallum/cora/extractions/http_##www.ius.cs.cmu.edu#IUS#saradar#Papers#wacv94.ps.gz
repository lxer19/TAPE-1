Abstract: A new method for extracting planar polygonal rooftops in monocular aerial imagery is proposed. Structural features are extracted and hierarchically related using perceptual grouping techniques. Top-down feature verification is used so that features, and links between the features, are verified with local information in the image and weighed in a graph. Cycles in the graph correspond to possible building rooftop hypotheses. Virtual features are hypothesized for the perceptual completion of partially occluded rooftops.

Reference-contexts: Because we are interested in the detection of human-made structure, straight lines and orthogonal corners were used as low level features. 3.1 Straight lines Straight lines are extracted using two different methods. The primary, bottom-up method for extracting low level straight line features is the Boldt algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. This algorithm hierarchically groups edgels into progressively longer line segments based on proximity and collinearity constraints. Figure 3 shows the Boldt lines extracted from a typical aerial urban scene. <p> Boldt lines are assigned a certainty measure that is calculated during their extraction. The line certainty depends primarily on the contrast of the edge and on the least-squares residual error of the Boldt line fit to the grouped edges. For a detailed description of Boldt line certainty, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Another line detection scheme is used for top-down grouping verification. These local lines are extracted when possible groupings between features are being considered and supporting Boldt lines are absent. This approach provides the power of perceptual grouping without restricting ourselves to a single set of globally extracted features.

Reference-contexts: In many typical scenes, lines are broken and can branch into many different paths, which causes an exponential path following problem. Segmentation followed by analysis of region boundaries was used to search for human-made structure in aerial images by <ref> [5] </ref>. These techniques only work well for simple scenes where rooftops appear as complete, uniform regions, or when the expected shape of rooftop regions is known. The MOSAIC system [6] constructed partial, three dimensional wire frame models from both monocular and stereo imagery of a scene.

Reference-contexts: Perceptual organization techniques provide the impetus for many building extraction systems. Reynolds and Beveridge [15] defined a focus of attention mechanism for human-made structures based on connected components of spatially proximate parallel and orthogonal line segments. Huertas, Lin and Nevatia <ref> [7] </ref> extract parallel lines and orthogonal intersections that are further grouped into rectangular buildings. Build--ing hypotheses are verified through the use of shadow information. In a similar approach, Mohan and Nevatia [14] extract lines as low level features and compute corners from the line data. <p> Then, upon discovery of two parallel lines, a local low level line finder would be invoked as a top-down process to aid in the higher level grouping procedure. Task driven perceptual organization extends the grouping hierarchies in <ref> [7, 14] </ref> to a bidirectional approach. The system is not limited to a nadir views; we do, however, assume the camera lens and pose parameters are known or have been precomputed. 2.1 Overview The system proceeds in three steps; low level feature extraction, collated feature detection, and hypothesis arbitration. <p> A collated feature is a sequence of perceptually grouped corners and lines that form a chain. A valid chain group must contain an alternation of corners and lines, and can be of any length. Chains are a generalization of the collated features in earlier work <ref> [7, 14] </ref> and allow final polygons of arbitrary shape to be constructed from low level features. Construction of the collated features is analogous to placing edges in the feature relation graph. Low level features are grouped together according to the standard perceptual parameters of smoothness and sym metry.

Reference-contexts: A basic overview of past research appears in [17]. Previous attempts at the building detection problem included contour following techniques augmented with domain specific knowledge about structure <ref> [8, 11] </ref>. Typically, these methods are restricted to images where edge contours are clear. In many typical scenes, lines are broken and can branch into many different paths, which causes an exponential path following problem.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, corner features are or-thogonal and parallel to the ground plane in the 3D world. Of course, the apparent shape of an orthogonal corner in the image is not invariant under perspective projection, but varies predictably with respect to image position <ref> [10] </ref>. To further simplify processing, we assume that a majority of the buildings are aligned according to an approximate city grid.

Reference-contexts: Although it was originally designed for nadir imagery, recent enhancements to BABE generalize it to oblique views by incorporating rigorous photogrammetric camera models and vanishing point information <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 Task driven organization Perceptual organization is a powerful method for locating and extracting structure in natural scenes. In our approach, low level features are grouped to form collated features which are then used to hypothesize the final groupings. <p> The relative orientation of the city grid with respect to the camera completely determines how these four cardinal corner types will appear in the image. Currently, we compute this orientation from the given camera pose, however the city-grid orientation can also be computed more generally using vanishing point analysis. <ref> [12] </ref> Four different ideal corner masks are generated, one for each cardinal direction. Warping is performed by mapping the lines that define the orthogonal corner through the perspective transformation and into the new expected corner angle.

Reference-contexts: This approach avoids many of the domain assumptions necessary for earlier work and allows for multiple, competing hypotheses. Unfortunately, the work is limited to nadir imagery and on accurate extraction of line segments. The BABE system <ref> [13] </ref> performs perceptual grouping of lines and orthogonal corners into chains and rectangles to form building hypotheses that are later verified using shadow information.
