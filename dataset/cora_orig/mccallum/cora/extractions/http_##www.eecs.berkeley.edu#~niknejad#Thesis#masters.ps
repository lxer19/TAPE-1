Most modifications model second order effects that increase the effective usable bandwidth of the model. For instance, a C BR has been added to model the interwinding capacitance and to make the series inductance and resistance frequency dependent. Some authors [2] use a nonlinear resistor to model skin/proximity effects. C S represents displacement current in the substrate which makes the substrate impedance vary as a function of frequency. <p> At low-frequency, the dominant source of loss comes from the series loss of the spiral. A process utilizing thick metal [27], or high conductivity metal <ref> [2] </ref> can be utilized to improve the low-frequency performance of the inductors. At high frequency, the substrate loss limits the Q, and the substrate capacitance lowers the self-resonant frequency of the structure. Clearly, utilizing thicker oxide and lower permittivity dielectric helps to reduce the capacitance [7].

Reference-contexts: By increasing the self-resonant frequency, the substrate loss is also lowered. Alternatively, if special processing steps are taken, the spiral may be isolated from the substrate by etching away the oxide below the spiral and floating the inductor <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to lowering the permittivity of the spiral capacitance, it also moves the spiral farther away from spiral. This increase in self-resonance allows one to design physically larger inductors, either to minimize loss or to attain a higher inductance value.

Reference-contexts: It also reduces loss by allowing wider metal line widths. But the value of s also affects current constriction. Hence, while at low frequency one usually uses the minimum spacing available to maximize magnetic coupling, at high frequency proximity effects favor a larger value of spacing <ref> [8] </ref>. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 where we plot the resistance of a typical spiral using two values of spacing. Similar considerations apply to the area of the spiral and the number of turns. <p> But at high frequencies the Q is dominated by the substrate and smaller areas are favorable. This is doubly true for highly conductive substrates which suffer from eddy-current losses at high frequency <ref> [8] </ref>. Given A o and minimum s, one can vary w and n to obtain the optimal Q at a particular frequency. Fig. 2 plots the optimum number of turns n as a function of outer length of a square spiral for different inductance values (the width w also varies).

Reference-contexts: This increase in self-resonance allows one to design physically larger inductors, either to minimize loss or to attain a higher inductance value. The substrate loss can be reduced by eliminating the substrate resistance. This can be done by either shorting out the substrate resistance or by open-circuiting it <ref> [22] </ref>. To short it out, one can place a high-conductivity conductor under the spiral, or alternatively place the spiral above a highly doped grounded layer. While this will reduce the substrate resistance value, it will have the deleterious effect of inducing substrate currents to flow.

Reference-contexts: For example, transformer baluns aid in converting signals from differential to single-ended, and vice versa. In this way, they can be used to improve the gain of differential circuits which feed single-ended circuits <ref> [24] </ref>. In [25] a transformer is used as a low-noise feedback element to improve the performance of a LNA. Since inductance is a well controlled parameter (primarily determined by lithography), absolute inductance values are accurate to begin with, and inductor ratios are even more accurate.

A process utilizing thick metal <ref> [27] </ref>, or high conductivity metal [2] can be utilized to improve the low-frequency performance of the inductors.

Reference-contexts: To understand this, consider a perfectly conducting ground layer. Using the method of images under quasi-static approximation, the ground current will mirror the substrate current, producing a magnetic emf in opposition to the spiral <ref> [28] </ref>. To combat this effect, one can place conductive strips in a grid fashion utilizing low conductance open-circuit spaces to minimize eddy currents. This is the approach taken by [35].

Reference-contexts: Also, the substrate shield must be sufficiently thick (thicker than the skin-depth in the material in question) to be effective at high frequency. To increase the substrate resistance, one can utilize a lowly doped substrate. In the limit, the substrate becomes intrinsic and <ref> [29] </ref> has reported good performance with this substrate. As discussed in section 6.2, multiple metal layers can be used to improve inductor performance. Hence, IC processes with many metal layers can be advantageous.

Reference-contexts: The drawback, though, is that the extracted inductance is not physical and contains the effects of the capacitive coupling which tends to boost the inductance as a function of frequency, similar to a parallel tank. The extraction technique presented in <ref> [34] </ref> is superior in this regard. To extract Q using Fig. 6.1a one can define the input or output Q by the two-port parameters. Looking into port 1 Q Y 1 11 Im ( ) (1) The above definition has the awkward property that the Q is zero at self-resonance.

Reference-contexts: To combat this effect, one can place conductive strips in a grid fashion utilizing low conductance open-circuit spaces to minimize eddy currents.

One must exercise caution, though, as the substrate shield might adversely affect the substrate coupling at high frequency due to the finite inductance in the ground. Also, the substrate shield must be sufficiently thick (thicker than the skin-depth in the material in question) to be effective at high frequency.
