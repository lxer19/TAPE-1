Abstract: A fundamental limitation exists in the achievable transient performance of systems which have more outputs than inputs. It is shown that straightforward formulae exist for the limiting cost of the cheap control problem for systems that have more outputs than inputs. The regulation problem and the tracking problem are both considered. An example is provided to illustrate the utility of the results.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The use of linear quadratic regulators to control linear time invariant systems is a widely accepted technique for designing feedback controllers <ref> [1] </ref>. The technique has the advantages that it has easily computable closed form solutions for controller design and that it has been applied successfully in practical applications. The linear quadratic regulator problem is concerned with the minimization of a cost functional. <p> Denote an inner-outer factorization of P (s) by P 1 (s)P 2 (s). Denote the set of zeros of P 2 (s) as Z. Then (i). R = f ae i : i 2 <ref> [1; : : : ; N ae ] </ref>g are zeros of P 2 (s), where ae i are the NMP zeros of P (s). (ii). <p> Then (i). R = f ae i : i 2 [1; : : : ; N ae ]g are zeros of P 2 (s), where ae i are the NMP zeros of P (s). (ii). L = f i : i 2 <ref> [1; : : : ; N ] </ref>g are zeros of P 2 (s), where i are the CLHP zeros of P (s). (iii). <p> L = f i : i 2 [1; : : : ; N ]g are zeros of P 2 (s), where i are the CLHP zeros of P (s). (iii). D = fffi i : i 2 <ref> [1; : : : ; N ffi ] </ref>g are zeros of P 2 (s), where ffi i are the CLHP zeros of P T (s)P (s) which are not elements of R or L. (iv). Z = R [ L [ D. <p> Lemma 3.12 Consider the LQ optimal regulator. It follows that ffiT i x 0 is independent of the state space realization chosen, 8i 2 <ref> [1; : : : ; N ffi ] </ref>. Similarly, aeT i x 0 is independent of the state space realization chosen, 8i 2 [1; : : : ; N ae ]. <p> Lemma 3.12 Consider the LQ optimal regulator. It follows that ffiT i x 0 is independent of the state space realization chosen, 8i 2 [1; : : : ; N ffi ]. Similarly, aeT i x 0 is independent of the state space realization chosen, 8i 2 <ref> [1; : : : ; N ae ] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A detailed treatment of the general linear cheap control problem is given in [13]. It has long been recognised that using linear quadratic regulators when the plant has non-minimum phase zeros is more problematic than the minimum phase case <ref> [2] </ref>. The achievable performance for systems with non-minimum phase zeros has been studied by several authors. In [22] the author derived formulae for the limiting cheap control cost of a linear system in terms of the NMP zeros and the initial state of the system.
