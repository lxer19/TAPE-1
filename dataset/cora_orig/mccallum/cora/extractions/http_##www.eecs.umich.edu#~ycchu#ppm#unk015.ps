Abstract: This paper describes how an analytical queuing model may be constructed which The application of analytical queuing model technologies to the capacity planning of commercial IT systems is a well-established discipline. The modelling approach has been extended from mainframe systems to UNIX systems and more recently to Windows NT systems. One issue that has not yet been fully addressed within modelling is that of specifically modelling Oracle workloads. An Oracle-based system has special features that require an extension to the traditional approach. The work of an Oracle system is distributed across many processes or threads, so workload characterisation presents certain challenges. In addition, there are architectural features of Oracle that need to handled to construct an adequate model, e.g. internal contention for the SGA cache, database locks and the redo log buffer. This paper surveys the issues and techniques for building such models and describes how they can be implemented as part of a packaged solution. incorporates Oracle session data, and will consider any issues and shortcomings in

Reference-contexts: This information gives the visit count for each workload component and lock, the throughput at each lock and the queue length at each lock. The mean response time at each lock is deduced from the throughput and the queue length using Littles Law <ref> (Little, 1961) </ref> and eventually yields the mean time that the lock is held for by applying the utilisation law. This is the mean service time of the lock device. There is also a secondary effect.
