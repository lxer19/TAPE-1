Title: Flow Patterns and Sinklink Structures in Compartmental Analysis  
Author: James N. Bellinger 
Note: This work was sponsored by a National Science Foundation Undergraduate Student Program grant.  
Date: August 13, 1976  
Abstract: We consider a system of compartments containing material with material flow possible among the compartments. We assume that the system is closed in the sense that the total amount of material remains constant in time. We define a property `well-connectedness' of the system matrix A and show that this is equivalent to the system lacking sink-like structures.
