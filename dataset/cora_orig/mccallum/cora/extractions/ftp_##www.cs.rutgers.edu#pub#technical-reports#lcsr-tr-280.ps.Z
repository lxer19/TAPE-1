Abstract: We present a method for segmenting and estimating the shape of 3-D objects from range data. The technique uses model views, or aspects, to constrain the fitting of deformable models to range data. Based on an initial region segmentation of a range image, regions are grouped into aspects corresponding to the volumetric parts that make up an object. The qualitative segmentation of the range image into a set of volumetric parts not only captures the coarse shape of the parts, but qualitatively encodes the orientation of each part through its aspect. Knowledge of a part's coarse shape, its orientation, as well as the mapping between the faces in its aspect and the surfaces on the part provides strong constraints on the fitting of a deformable model (supporting both global and local deformations) to the data. Unlike previous work in physics-based deformable model recovery from range data, the technique does not require pre-segmented data. Furthermore, occlusion is handled at segmentation time and does not complicate the fitting process, as only 3-D points known to belong to a part participate in the fitting of a model to the part. We present the approach in detail and apply it to the recovery of objects from range data. fl A condensed version of this technical report is to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI).

Reference-contexts: The idea of generalized cylinders has subsequently been elaborated in two very different ways. One variation is due to Biederman <ref> [2] </ref>, who suggested using the Cartesian product of qualitative properties such as tapering, cross-section, etc., in order to create a qualitative taxonomy of generalized cylinders. His theory was that the use of such a qualitative representation could simplify the process of segmenting objects into parts.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we apply the techniques to a set of range images and close with some conclusions and limitations. 2 2 Related Work The first parts representation was due to Binford <ref> [3] </ref>, who suggested the idea of generalized cylinders. Unfortunately, the recovery of this type of representation seems to require elaborate line grouping and reasoning, a difficult and largely unsolved problem. Moreover, because such descriptions are often not unique, it is unclear how they aid in object recognition.

Reference-contexts: However, filtering out low-scoring volumes means that more regions in the image will be left uninterpreted. In fact, low-scoring volumes can be used to guide the sensor to acquire a higher-scoring volume <ref> [4] </ref>. We are currently looking at ways in which weaker qualitative information, short of a complete part aspect, can provided the needed constraints for fitting. Both the qualitative and quantitative shape representation schemes are general.

Reference-contexts: The technique combines qualitative models for segmentation but does not attempt to recover a precise parametric model. Instead, the static superquadric fitting step is used only as an aid for geon labeling. Dickinson and Metaxas <ref> [5] </ref> present an approach in which recovered qualitative shape is used to constrain the recovery of a deformable model (global deformations only) from 2-D image data. This paper extends that approach to 3-D data, by first introducing a new view-based representation for 3-D data.

Reference-contexts: This technique was applied to the top-down recognition of multipart objects in Dickinson et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. Moving down the aspect hierarchy, target objects map to target volumes which, in turn, map to target aspect predictions which, in turn, map to target face predictions. <p> If the mapping from a verified aspect to a target volume is ambiguous, this attention mechanism can be used to drive an active recognition system which moves the cameras to obtain a less ambiguous view of an object's part <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This paper extends that approach to 3-D data, by first introducing a new view-based representation for 3-D data. This representation, called the range aspect hierarchy, is similar in structure to the original aspect hierarchy introduced in <ref> [7, 9, 8] </ref>, but with an additional surface curvature attribute recoverable from range data. <p> The resulting framework thereby offers a unified approach to 3-D shape recovery and segmentation from range data. 3 Object Modeling 3.1 Qualitative Shape Modeling In <ref> [7] </ref>, we introduced a hybrid object representation for the recognition of 3-D objects from 2-D images. Objects were constructed from some finite set of object-centered, volumetric parts, while the parts were represented in the image as a finite set of hierarchically-defined viewer-centered aspects. <p> Recently, Raja and Jain [27], extended this idea to the domain of range data where view-based representations were used to model the appearance of a finite set of volumetric parts. Like the aspect definition proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>, Raja and Jain chose to eliminate symmetries from the aspect graph, so that all views having the same component shapes and adjacencies belonged to the same class regardless of which surfaces of the volumetric part the views mapped to.

Reference-contexts: His theory was that the use of such a qualitative representation could simplify the process of segmenting objects into parts. Dickinson, Pentland and Rosenfeld <ref> [9, 8] </ref> have extended Biederman's representation to include intermediate representations and conditional probabilities that guide the grouping process.

During the search process, aspect verification, like face matching, is accomplished through the use of an interpretation tree search (Grimson and Lozano-Perez [13]). <p> This time, we search through the space of volume hypotheses until we find a set of volumes that are consistent with the objects in the database (Dickinson et al. <ref> [8] </ref>). In an expected or top-down object recognition domain, in which we are searching for a particular object or part, we use the range aspect hierarchy as an attention mechanism to focus the search for an aspect at appropriate regions in the image.

Some work has already proceeded along these lines. Using a part-based aspect approach to segmentation based on Dickinson et al. <ref> [9] </ref>, Raja and Jain [26] segment a range image into parts corresponding to geons. In order to determine geon orientation, i.e., end vs. side faces, they fit a superquadric to the segmented part to determine the principal axis of the geon. <p> This paper extends that approach to 3-D data, by first introducing a new view-based representation for 3-D data.

Descriptions that exactly match (both surface shape and boundary) a face in the range aspect hierarchy will be given a single label with probability 1.0. <p> This search is guided by a heuristic based on the conditional probabilities in the range aspect hierarchy [9, 8]. During the search process, aspect verification, like face matching, is accomplished through the use of an interpretation tree search (Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [13] </ref>). Once a set of aspects has been recovered, each aspect is used to infer one or more volume hypotheses based on the non-zero conditional probabilities mapping aspects to volumes in the range aspect hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Some work has already proceeded along these lines. Using a part-based aspect approach to segmentation based on Dickinson et al. [9], Raja and Jain <ref> [26] </ref> segment a range image into parts corresponding to geons. In order to determine geon orientation, i.e., end vs. side faces, they fit a superquadric to the segmented part to determine the principal axis of the geon.

Reference-contexts: Objects were constructed from some finite set of object-centered, volumetric parts, while the parts were represented in the image as a finite set of hierarchically-defined viewer-centered aspects. Recently, Raja and Jain <ref> [27] </ref>, extended this idea to the domain of range data where view-based representations were used to model the appearance of a finite set of volumetric parts. <p> For the model we propose here, we extend our concept of the aspect hierarchy to support range data, and add the surface shape attribute to the face components of an aspect, as proposed by Raja and Jain <ref> [27] </ref>. <p> Next, an initial surface segmentation is formed based on a clustering of the surface normals; similar adjacent patches are merged. Each surface is then classified according to the signs of its maximum and minimum curvatures. One problem with this method, as pointed out in Raja and Jain <ref> [27] </ref>, is that since surfaces are segmented along orientation discontinuities, certain complex surfaces, like the body of the bent cylinder in Figure 1, do not have a unique surface classification.
