Abstract: This paper describes a wavelet method for the estimation of density and hazard rate functions from randomly right censored data. We adopt a nonparametric approach in assuming that the density and hazard rate have no specific parametric form. The method is based on dividing the time axis into a dyadic number of intervals and then counting the number of events within each interval. The number of events and the survival function of the observations are then separately smoothed over time via linear wavelet smoothers, and then the hazard rate function estimators are obtained by taking the ratio. We prove that the estimators possess pointwise and global mean square consistency, obtain the best possible asymptotic MISE convergence rate and are also asymptotically normally distributed. We also describe simulation experiments that show these estimators are reasonably reliable in practice. The method is illustrated with two real examples. The first uses survival time data for patients with liver metastases from a colorectal primary tumour without other distant metastases. The second is concerned with times of unemployment for women and the wavelet estimate, through its flexibility, provides a new and interesting interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In applications it is widely assumed that the &lt; f fl ; OE N;k &gt;' 2 N=2 f fl (k=2 N ), but such an approximation is rarely justified. When OE is a regular enough coiflet, the accuracy of this approximation can be controlled by the following lemma <ref> (the proof may be found in Antoniadis, 1996) </ref>. Lemma 2 Given an m-differentiable function r, let r fjg (k) = 2 j=2 &lt; r; OE j;k &gt;.

Reference-contexts: In all these studies, interest focuses on estimating the underlying distribution density and hazard rate of the time to occurrence of the primary failure event. In the above settings, popular methods for performing density and hazard rate estimation include kernel and nearest neighbour smoothing on the time axis <ref> (Beran 1981, Dabrowska 1987, Gray 1992) </ref>. Penalized likelihood methods, such as those described by O'Sullivan (1988), Antoniadis (1989), Antoniadis and Gregoire (1990) have also been developed for hazard estimation. In all these methods, the programming to implement reasonably fast algorithms is not trivial.

Reference-contexts: In this data set there are 361 uncensored and 261 censored observations. In order to compare our wavelet estimator (solid line) we also report on the figures the logspline subdensity estimator (dashed line) and the local polynomial estimator (dotted line) implemented in locfit <ref> (see Loader, 1995) </ref>. Each estimation method uses a global data driven choice for the smoothing parameters (for pointers to an archive and for more details on this choice for logspline and locfit the reader is referred to the papers by Kooperberg and Stone, 1992 and Loader, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Existing wavelet density estimation methods such as those developed by Donoho et al. (1995) are based on thresholding empirical wavelet coefficients. For moderate sample sizes the resultant density estimates can have a very rough appearance <ref> (see Tribouley, 1995) </ref>. The hazard estimator will then be obtained by taking the ratios of the subdensity estimate by an empirical wavelet estimator of the probability of remaining at risk. The general formulation and some theoretical properties of the method are discussed in the following section.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in relatively general situations, an estimator of the form ^ L n (t) = n i=1 where fH n g is a sequence of continuous cdfs required to converge weakly to cdf of the delta distribution centered at 0 has been suggested in the literature <ref> (see Winter, 1973, 1979, Puri and Ralescu, 1986, Yukish, 1989) </ref>. Such estimators arise quite naturally as integrals of density estimators of the kernel type.
