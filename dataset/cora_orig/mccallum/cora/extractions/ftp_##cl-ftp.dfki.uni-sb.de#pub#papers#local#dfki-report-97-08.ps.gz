Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As Pollard and Sag <ref> (1994, Ch. 9.5) </ref> point out CELRs are a psycholinguistically motivated means for describing extraction phenomena. The CELR proposed there can be successfully applied in English grammars. However, the rule stated by Pollard and Sag is not equivalent to the trace solution described in Chapter 4 of their book.

Reference-contexts: This was proposed by Chung for Korean and by Rentier (1994) for Dutch. It is reasonable for German as well because, as was shown by Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994a), the verb cluster has to be built up before any nonverbal complement can be saturated. Hinrichs and Nakazawa 4 See <ref> (M uller, 1994) </ref> for a discussion of several approaches. As noted there, Pollard (1994) sketches a different approach employing defaults. Defaults are not part of the basic HPSG formalism. 5 I assume that subj is a head feature since the subj value must be projected to account for control phenomena. <p> Once it is contained in the slash set case assignment is not possible anymore. As was shown in <ref> (M uller, 1994) </ref>, it is not possible to use the static arg-s list proposed in Chapter 9 of (Pollard and Sag, 1994) for case assignment. <p> So for instance, a comps list which need not be ordered gives the grammar writer the choice between using reordering lexical rules or a comps set. 6 The Extraction of Sub jects and von -PPs Not all the problems discussed in <ref> (M uller, 1994) </ref> are solved yet. The remaining question is how subjects and von-PPs can be extracted. Because both subjects and other complements can appear sentence initially, German V2 sentences are usually described by the topicalization of the subject or of one of the other com <p>- plements.

Reference-contexts: Pollard does not use the vcomp feature. 6 Note that such an analysis presupposes that the elements on the comps list are arranged in order of obliqueness (cf. <ref> (Pollard and Sag, 1987, p. 120) </ref>), i.e: SUBJECT =&gt; PRIMARY OBJECT =&gt; SECOND OBJECT =&gt; OTHER COMPLEMENTS 3 CASE AND PASSIVE IN GERMAN 4 use a feature npcomp to prevent the saturation of nonverbal complements before the verbal cluster is built.

Reference-contexts: Tough-adjectives 2 are an instance of the latter case. 1 <ref> (Pollard and Sag, 1994, p. 216) </ref> 2 Pollard and Sag (1994, p. 167) assume that tough-adjectives subcategorize for an infinitive VP with a non-empty slash set. 2 GERMAN V2 2 The rule (1) changes the position of complements in the comps list. <p> This feature is needed for a unified account of the German personal and impersonal passive (see <ref> (Pollard, 1994) </ref> for details). 3 CASE AND PASSIVE IN GERMAN 5 Heinz and Matiasek use a case principle which employs the order information of the comps list. 9 The least oblique element receives nominative case if its case value is structural . <p> Once it is contained in the slash set case assignment is not possible anymore. As was shown in (M uller, 1994), it is not possible to use the static arg-s list proposed in Chapter 9 of <ref> (Pollard and Sag, 1994) </ref> for case assignment. The static arg-s list would contain subj+comps in order of obliqueness and would not vary according to the syntactic environment in which the lexical entry is used.

Reference-contexts: If one would ignore the nonlocal values in the rule (1) this would allow sentences like (ii) but sentences like (iii) would be possible as well. (iii) * [To talk to John] j , John is easy j 3 In GPSG analyses this is assumed as well (cf. <ref> (Uszkoreit, 1987) </ref>). 3 CASE AND PASSIVE IN GERMAN 3 saturation. 4 In what follows, I will present an account of German passive that combines work done by several people.
