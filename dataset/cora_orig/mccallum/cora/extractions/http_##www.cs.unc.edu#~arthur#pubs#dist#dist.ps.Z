Title: Viewing shape through distorting media  
Author: Kevin Arthur 
Date: December 12, 1994  
Abstract: The manifold of light rays that reach the retina to form an image do not typically span the viewing sphere uniformly. Light reflects or refracts off of surfaces to form folds in the spherical image of the ray manifold, referred to as optical caustics. These caustics determine the topology of the images of points and curves in object space. This report describes how the geometry of points and curves changes on encountering caustics in the ray manifold, and applies these concepts to some geometrically interesting phenomena that occur in nature: mirages, refraction through water droplets, and reflection off of rippling water.

Reference-contexts: Multiple imaging happens when we see both an object and its reflection in a mirror, for example. The spherical image of the ray propagation develops folds and pleats. Generally, a fold line signifies a place where the light rays focus and change direction. These lines form optical caustics <ref> [Berry and Upstill, 1980] </ref>. The caustics divide up the spherical image into regions where different number of rays reach a point in the scene. When light hits a surface and reflects or refracts, caustics can occur, intersecting the parabolic curves on the surface. <p> A star in the sky, for example, may be seen in two places at the same time through a telescope because of gravitational refraction by planets or galaxies. Generally, the number of image points that we see from a single object point must be odd <ref> [Berry and Upstill, 1980] </ref>. Multiple imaging of points is well understood and has long been a subject of study for astronomers. Recently, Berry [1987] has described the effect of optical caustics on the imaging of curves. <p> One typically views the caustics in the far field by watching the light patterns refracted onto a wall a meter or so away, or one can view the caustics at multiple depths in the near field to see their three-dimensional structure and their formation <ref> [Berry and Upstill, 1980] </ref>[Lock and Andrews, 1992]. We first consider a droplet sitting flat on a horizontal transparent surface. In this case the tension on the surface of the drop is relatively uniform (in particular, gravity acts uniformly on the droplet).

Reference-contexts: number of distinct loops in an image of the Sun or the Moon reflected in the water (referred to as "glitter patches" [Minnaert, 1954]) increases as the distance from which the surface is viewed increases, and as the distance approaches infinity their distribution can be described by a fractal curve <ref> [Berry, 1987] </ref>. Mendes France [1993] determines the number of reflections possible, which turns out to be either finite and odd or infinite.

Reference-contexts: Mirages come in a few different varieties. [Minnaert, 1954] <ref> [Fraser and Mach, 1976] </ref> The type familiar to most people is the "inferior" mirage or desert mirage. These typically happen above hot surfaces, such as an asphalt road on a sunny day, when you look out towards the horizon. <p> More complex mirages such as the "Fata Morgana" mirage can form when looking out over the ocean; portions of the sea are reflected into the sky as white or grey patches easily mistaken for pillars or large structures in the air <ref> [Fraser and Mach, 1976] </ref>. The shape and apparent structure of these patches comes from the extreme magnification and defocusing through the atmosphere that 4 (right). redistributes the brightness of the surface.

Water waves can come in a wide variety of shapes; for a simple water surface represented as a product of sinusoids, the reflection of a mast will appears as in Figure 6. This illustrates the formation of loops as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: In a similar way to how mirages form, other atmospheric effects such as rainbows and halos can be readily described in terms of light bending through the atmosphere to form caustics [Minnaert, 1954] <ref> [Greenler, 1980] </ref>. 4 Refraction through water droplets Anyone who has worn eyeglasses is familiar with the distortion of images seen through raindrops. Caustics caused by refraction through water droplets vary according to the shape of the drop.
