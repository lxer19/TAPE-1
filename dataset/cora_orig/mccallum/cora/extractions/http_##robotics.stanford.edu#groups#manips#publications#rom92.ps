Abstract: The work reported in this paper is a part of a larger effort concerned with the design and development of a high-performance force controlled, ten degree-of-freedom manipulator and mini-manipulator system, ARTISAN, currently under construction at Stanford University (Khatib, Roth and Waldron 1991). The paper focuses on the new actuation system developed for this robot. It discusses the design of the actuator-transmission-sensor system, describes the joint torque feedback controller, and presents experimental results obtained with a prototype of the wrist mechanism of ARTISAN.

Reference-contexts: Another line of research has been directed at the development of direct-drive arms which eliminate transmission non-linearities. Since the first development of a direct-drive arm at CMU <ref> (Asada and Kanade 1983) </ref>, several other designs have been proposed and direct-drive manipulators have become commercially available. However, direct-drive arms require relatively massive actuators. Additionally, direct-drive manipulators are more sensitive to dynamic coupling, and thus will be more susceptible to dynamic modeling errors and dynamic perturbations.

Reference-contexts: Based on experiments with a single joint (Wu and Paul, 1980), the first two joints of a Stanford Arm were redesigned (Luh, Fisher, and Paul, 1983) to accommodate torque sensors. Joint torque sensory feedback has also been implemented in a direct-drive manipulator <ref> (Asada, Youcef-Toumi, and Lim, 1984) </ref> and in a PUMA manipulator (Pfeffer, Khatib, and Hake, 1986).

Reference-contexts: Both the motors and the gears are selected so as to minimize their non-linearities. The design tradeoffs between ratio, diameter, and load capacity faced when using single stage gear reduction are addressed through the use of evoloid gear sets for each joint <ref> (Berlinger 1975) </ref>. Evoloid gears are very similar to helical spur gears except that coarser pitches are normally used. As with helical gears, evoloid gear sets are easily backdriveable and have smooth torque transfer characteristics. Evoloid pinions, however, are noticeably different from similarly sized helical spur gear pinions.

Reference-contexts: There have been several efforts to improve joint torque control with joint torque sensing. Based on experiments with a single joint (Wu and Paul, 1980), the first two joints of a Stanford Arm were redesigned <ref> (Luh, Fisher, and Paul, 1983) </ref> to accommodate torque sensors. Joint torque sensory feedback has also been implemented in a direct-drive manipulator (Asada, Youcef-Toumi, and Lim, 1984) and in a PUMA manipulator (Pfeffer, Khatib, and Hake, 1986).

Reference-contexts: The use of sinusoidal commutation, versus conventional six-step methods, reduces torque ripple by assuring continuous, smooth commutation to all windings, while compensating for the motor's sinusoidally varying torque constant. This technique reduces the torque ripple from 5-15% down to 3% or less <ref> (McCormick 1990) </ref>. Torque Sensor Design Previous investigation of torque sensing devices resulted in a conceptually new torque sensor (Vis-cher and Khatib 1989) which obtains torques from measurements of beam deflections through the use of contact-free distance sensors.

Reference-contexts: Joint torque sensory feedback has also been implemented in a direct-drive manipulator (Asada, Youcef-Toumi, and Lim, 1984) and in a PUMA manipulator <ref> (Pfeffer, Khatib, and Hake, 1986) </ref>. These experiments have shown that, although joint friction effects can be substantially reduced by torque servoing, a wide joint actuation bandwidth is difficult to achieve without actually reducing the friction and nonlinearities in the actuator-transmission system.

(Eds.), </editor> <publisher> Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, </publisher> <pages> pp. 271-286. </pages>
Reference-contexts: We have taken advantage of the second possibility in our design. To illustrate, the previous ARTISAN prototype <ref> (Vischer and Khatib 1990) </ref> used 15.2 cm diameter, 6:1 helical gears. The evoloid gears used in the current prototype have smaller diameters of 12.2 cm and 14.1 cm, with higher ratios of 13.25:1 and 15:1. <p> In the ARTISAN wrist prototype, the torque sensor has been removed from the gear and placed as either the first or last element of the joint transmission. This assures that the total torque between the joints is measured. As discussed in the earlier analysis of sensor placement <ref> (Vischer and Khatib 1990) </ref>, this placement greatly reduces the disturbance effects of radial forces generated by the meshing of the gears. This location of the sensor, however, allows other forces from the link to cause sensor deflections.

Reference-contexts: This ability, however, is considerably restricted by the nonlinearities and friction inherent in the actuator-transmission systems generally found in industrial robots. There have been several efforts to improve joint torque control with joint torque sensing. Based on experiments with a single joint <ref> (Wu and Paul, 1980) </ref>, the first two joints of a Stanford Arm were redesigned (Luh, Fisher, and Paul, 1983) to accommodate torque sensors. Joint torque sensory feedback has also been implemented in a direct-drive manipulator (Asada, Youcef-Toumi, and Lim, 1984) and in a PUMA manipulator (Pfeffer, Khatib, and Hake, 1986).
