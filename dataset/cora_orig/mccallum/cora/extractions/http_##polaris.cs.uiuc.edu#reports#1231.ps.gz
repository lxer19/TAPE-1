Reference-contexts: We note however that in contrast to CGS, the asymptotic behavior of TFQMR has been analyzed <ref> [2] </ref>. It is also well-known that the CGS residual polynomial can be quite polluted by round-off error [16]. One possible remedy would be to combine TFQMR with a look-ahead Lanczos technique as was done for the original QMR method [5].

Reference-contexts: Various attempts have been made in the last forty years to extend the highly successful conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm to the nonsymmetric case <ref> [4] </ref>. One such natural extension is what is currently called the Bi-Conjugate Gradient algorithm (BCG) [9][1] Although BCG is still quite competitive today, it also has several well-known drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: It is also well-known that the CGS residual polynomial can be quite polluted by round-off error [16]. One possible remedy would be to combine TFQMR with a look-ahead Lanczos technique as was done for the original QMR method <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by deriving quasi-minimum residual extensions to Bi-CGSTAB. We call the basic method QMRCGSTAB and illustrate its smoothed convergence by means of numerical experiments. It may appear redundant to combine the local minimization in Bi-CGSTAB with a global quasi-minimization.

Reference-contexts: These observations led van der Vorst [18] to introduce Bi-CGSTAB, a more smoothly converging variant of CGS. The main idea is to form a product of the BCG polynomial with another, locally defined polynomial. The Bi-CGSTAB method was further refined by Gutknecht <ref> [7] </ref> to handle complex matrices and also lead to better convergence for the case of complex eigenvalues. Nevertheless, although the Bi-CGSTAB algorithms were found to perform very well compared to CGS in many situations, there are cases where convergence is still quite erratic (see, for example, Section 4 and [12]). <p> One possible strategy to overcome this is to set a lower bound for the quantity j (s i ; t i )j. However, for matrices with large imaginary parts, Gutknecht <ref> [7] </ref> observed that Bi-CGSTAB does not perform well because the steepest descent polynomials have only real roots and thus cannot be expected to approximate the spectrum well. <p> We note that for this operator, the use of centered differences and large values of fl are unfavorable for Bi-CGSTAB-type methods, since the resulting matrices would have pronounced skew-symmetric component, and eigenvalues with large imaginary parts <ref> [7] </ref>; different discretization methods would be more attractive [13]. Example 5. The next example illustrates how all methods can be affected by the conditioning of the generated polynomial.

In a recent paper [3], Freund proposed a new version of CGS, called TFQMR, which quasi-minimizes ([6]) the residual in the space spanned by the vectors generated by the CGS iteration.

E-mail: chtong@snll-arpagw.llnl.gov. 1 Many recently proposed methods can be viewed as improvements over some of these drawbacks of BCG. The most notable of these is the ingenious conjugate gradients-squared method (CGS) proposed by Sonneveld <ref> [14] </ref>, which cures the first drawback mentioned above by computing the square of the BCG polynomial without requiring A T . Hence when BCG converges, CGS is an attractive, faster converging alternative. <p> Experiments were conducted using a Beta test version of Matlab 4.0 [10] running on a Sun Sparc workstation.

This example was taken from <ref> [14] </ref> and corresponds to the discretization of the convection-diffusion operator L (u) = "4u + cos (ff)u x + sin (ff)u y (5) on the unit square with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions on the boundary and parameters " = 0:1 and ff = 30 ffi , using 40 grid points per direction,

Reference-contexts: We note that although the example is contrived, it does justify the implementation of a QMRCGSTAB-type method. We finally observe that experiments using several of the methods discussed herein, albeit using another naming convention, were presented in <ref> [15] </ref>. 5. Conclusions and future work. We have derived two QMR variants of Bi-CGSTAB.
