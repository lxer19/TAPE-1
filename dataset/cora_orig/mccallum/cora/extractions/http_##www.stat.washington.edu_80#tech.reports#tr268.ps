Reference-contexts: A variety of county-level characteristics were examined as predictors of admission rates.

We refer to this fitting algorithm as ML/QLM. We focus on four models; see Table 3. Model M 0 is the null model.

Reference-contexts: Hannan 1990). Incidence data | site-specific counts of new cancer cases | for various geographical areas have been studied (e.g. Riggan et al 1987), and have been used to examine 1 environmental factors associated with cancer incidence <ref> (e.g. Besag 1991) </ref>. Health service utilization rates have also been analyzed, to examine hypotheses about resource-driven use of health care (Caper 1990; Wennberg 1987, 1990), and about financial barriers to access to care (Billings 1990).

In many such applications, risk-adjustment is incorporated into the model to make rates more comparable, and covariate selection is an important step in building the risk-adjustment model. Back pain is prevalent in the US and is associated with high health care costs (Deyo, Cherkin and Conrad 1990).

Reference-contexts: Similar discrepancies occur in linear regression, where the incorporation of a prior tends to stabilize parameter estimates when they are highly correlated. Here parameters are independent a priori, and this leads to an estimation procedure similar to ridge regression, while ML/QLM is analogous to least squares estimation <ref> (Lindley and Smith 1972) </ref>. 4.1 Bayes Factor Approximation via Monte Carlo Integration Table 4 gives MC approximations to the marginal probabilites of the data under each of these four models, and also for three additional models.

Reference-contexts: As a result, when the Bayes factor is approximated by the ratio of two Laplace integral approximations, the error in ^ B LP = ^p LP (yjM 1 )=^p LP (yjM 0 ) is also of order O (n 1 ) <ref> (Kass and Raftery 1993) </ref>. Implementation of the Laplace approximation involves finding the maximum of h () and analytic expressions for its first and second derivatives. <p> A fi 1 prior that was more concentrated around zero led to increased support for inclusion of the covariate in the model. These results are typical of those for regression-type models <ref> (Raftery 1993) </ref>. Marginal probability estimates were also quite sensitive to t , the prior scale parameter for ff, although Bayes factor estimates were less so. Smaller t correspond to priors for ff that are closer to a point mass at zero. <p> Thus in terms of speed, neither approach clearly dominates the other.
