Abstract: This report compares results computed by automatic differentiation (via ADIFOR) and by hand-coded derivatives for a numerically complicated statistical code. This report analyzes the types of discrepancies that were found and describes steps taken to mediate each of them.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This report describes the application of the ADIFOR 2.0 automatic differentiation system <ref> [1, 2] </ref> to produce code to compute derivatives for a complicated statistical function: the log-likelihood for log-F distribution (LLDRLF)[3]. The ADIFOR system generated code to compute first and second derivative functions from the statistical function code. The authors of the statistical function code also "hand-coded" a version of the derivatives.

Reference-contexts: The ADIFOR system generated code to compute first and second derivative functions from the statistical function code. The authors of the statistical function code also "hand-coded" a version of the derivatives. The likelihood function calculation is exceptionally difficult to calculate numerically due to an exceptionally wide input domain <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Consequently, the strategy for computing this function is complicated. One of five different methods (Extreme Value Method, Bratio Method, Asymptotic Method, Continued Fraction Method, Series Method) is used to compute the function approximation within regions of the input domain.
