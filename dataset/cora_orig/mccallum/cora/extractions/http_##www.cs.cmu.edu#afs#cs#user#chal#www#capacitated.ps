Abstract: We provide approximation algorithms for some capacitated vehicle routing and delivery problems. These problems can all be viewed as instances of the following k-Delivery TSP: given n source points and n sink points in a metric space, with exactly one item at each source, find a minimum length tour by a vehicle of finite capacity k to pick up and deliver exactly one item to each sink. The only known approximation algorithm for this family of problems is the 2.5-approximation algorithm of Anily and Hassin [2] for the special case k = 1. For this case, we use matroid intersection to obtain a 2-approximation algorithm. Based on this algorithm and some additional lower bound arguments, we devise a 9.5-approximation for k-Delivery TSP with arbitrary finite k. We also present a 2-approximation algorithm for the case k = 1. We then initiate the study of dynamic variants of k-Delivery TSP that model problems in industrial robotics and other applications. Specifically, we consider the situation where a robot arm (with finite or infinite capacity) must collect n point-objects moving in the Euclidean plane, and deliver them to the origin. The point-objects are moving in the plane with known, identical velocities they might, for instance, be on a moving conveyor belt. We derive several useful structural properties that lead to constant-factor approximations for problems of this type that are relevant to the robotics application. Along the way, we show that Maximum Latency TSP is implicit in the dynamic problems, and that the natural "furthest neighbor" heuristic produces a good approximation for several notions of latency. 1. Introduction. This paper considers two variations on the classical Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP): (a) the permissible routes are constrained by the

(a) The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) <ref> [1, 25, 23] </ref>: given n points in a metric space and an infinite fleet of vehicles of capacity k, find a collection of vehicle routes starting at origin such that every point is visited by exactly one vehicle. <p> The static k-Collect TSP has received considerable attention in the literature and the best-known result is the 2.5-approximation algorithm of Altinkemer and Gavish <ref> [1] </ref>. Also, the k-Person TSP is a related problem and has a 1.5-approximation algorithm due to Frieze [20] (see also Frederickson, Hecht, and Kim [19]). 2. The k-Delivery TSP. We begin by presenting an approximation algorithm for the 1-Delivery TSP that underlies our algorithm for the general case. <p> This implies that C 1 =k d av =v, where d av denotes the average of the distances d i and C 1 =k is a lower bound on the optimal in the static problem (see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>). Thus, we will assume that v (2d av n)=k d av , i.e., v k 2n . <p> CHALASANI AND R. MOTWANI As we saw before, the ratio of the two directed distances between a pair of vertices never exceeds 1=ff, so the k-Collect TSP approximation algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref> can be used to approximate T 0 to within a factor 2:5=ff of optimal. Thus, we can approximate the optimal k-Collect tour time C k to within a factor 2:5e=ff. Theorem 4.8. For v k=2n, there is a (2:5e=ff)-approximation algorithm for Dynamic k-Collect TSP.

In Section 2, we begin by considering 1-Delivery TSP or Bipartite TSP. This is closely related to the Swapping Problem for which Anily and Hassin <ref> [2] </ref> present a 2.5-approximation algorithm. We use matroid intersection to obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for this problem. In Section 2.1, based on the 1-Delivery approximation algorithm and additional lower bound arguments, we devise a 9.5-approximation algorithm for k-Delivery TSP with arbitrary finite k. <p> A tour is bipartite if no two consecutively visited vertices have the same color. Anily and Hassin <ref> [2] </ref> have shown a 2.5-approximation algorithm for a generalization of this problem known as the Swapping Problem. Their algorithm finds a perfect matching M consisting of edges that connect red and blue vertices, and uses Christofides' heuristic [13] to find a tour T of the blue vertices.

First, we lose symmetry in the distance matrix; fortunately though, since the points are all moving at the same velocity, there is some structure in this asymmetry. <p> An interesting variant, which we do not explore here, concerns the model where the velocities are unrestricted and the goal is to maximize the number of points visited, with possible restrictions on the total time available.

The following result due to Konig <ref> [26, 31] </ref> is crucial to the design of our algorithm: Lemma 2.4. The edges of a d-regular bipartite multi-graph can be partitioned into d perfect matchings. Using this result, we can partition the perfect matching A into k perfect matchings on the super-nodes.

Reference-contexts: There does not appear to have been any prior theoretical work on Dynamic TSP. As described in Section 4, the dynamic problem arises in industrial robotics in the context of rapid deployment automation [10]. This problem also has some features of the time-dependent TSP <ref> [18, 32] </ref> wherein the distance function varies with time. We restrict ourselves to the case where the moving points' velocity is sufficiently smaller than that of the robot arm.

Reference-contexts: Typical objective functions to be minimized included number of vehicles, total distance traveled, maximum distance traveled by a vehicle, or some combination thereof. (b) The Dial-a-Ride Problem <ref> [6, 34, 27] </ref>: compute an optimal route for a k-capacity van to pick-up and drop-off n persons between different origin-destination pairs.
