Title: Noise and the Pursuit of Complexity: A Study in Evolutionary Robotics

Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for promoting the evolution of relatively complex behaviours in evolutionary robotics, based on the use of noise in simulation. A `homing navigation' behaviour is evolved (in simulation) for the Khepera mobile robot, and it is shown that high noise levels in the simulation promote the evolution of relatively complex behavioural and neural dynamics. It is also demonstrated that simulation noise can actually accelerate artificial evolution.

Reference-contexts: This approach, already shown to be viable (for example see Jakobi [4], Nolfi [9], Miglino et al. [8]), stands in contrast to two major alternatives. The first, evolution in real time on real robots (e.g. Floreano and Mondada <ref> [2] </ref>), does not easily allow for the explicit, quantitative specification of noise levels 2 and is also formidably time intensive. The second, evolution in simulation with significant abstraction from reality (e.g. Sims [11]), removes evolutionary robotics from the real world and therefore will not be pursued here. <p> It does not refer to stochastic aspects of the search algorithm. 2 Qualitative noise levels can be manipulated in the real world, for example by intro ducing flashing lights into the vicinity of the robot (see e.g. Jakobi et al. [6]). of real-world evolution by Floreano and Mondada <ref> [2] </ref>. It is demonstrated that large amounts of simulation noise promote the evolution of robots with relatively complex behaviours and neural dynamics compared to those evolved in simulations with low noise levels. It is also demonstrated that high noise levels can accelerate the evolutionary process. <p> This paper is concerned with exploring the same effect in an evolutionary robotics context. 3 A `homing navigation' experiment The context for this study is drawn from an experiment by Floreano and Mon-dada 1996 <ref> [2] </ref>. Their work is briefly described below. They demonstrate the real-world evolution of a `homing-navigation' be-haviour, using a Khepera robot [7]. This robot is equipped with an extra `floor sensor' in addition to the usual array of 8 infra-red proximity (and ambient light level) sensors. <p> With high noise levels in the simulation, evolutionary runs of about 100 generations always produced very fit individuals. These runs took about 1 hour on a single user Sun SparcUltra (143MHz) workstation, orders of magnitude faster than the real world evolution reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. Equally fit individuals evolved with low noise levels, although not nearly as rapidly as with high noise levels (this result is discussed in section 5.4). <p> In the NO condition, both A and B robots can repeatedly find the charging area (situated in 5 These tests were also performed by Floreano and Mondada <ref> [2] </ref>, who observed similar results to those of the `noisy' robots in the present study. However, the conclusions drawn about the nature of the controlling network are different in the present work. the lower left hand corner), and their trajectories are not obviously different.

Reference-contexts: The use of simulation permits the incorporation of specifiable amounts of noise 1 , and the condition of transference ensures that evolutionary robotics remains faithful to real robots in the real world. This approach, already shown to be viable (for example see Jakobi <ref> [4] </ref>, Nolfi [9], Miglino et al. [8]), stands in contrast to two major alternatives. The first, evolution in real time on real robots (e.g. Floreano and Mondada [2]), does not easily allow for the explicit, quantitative specification of noise levels 2 and is also formidably time intensive. <p> Controllers evolved in simulations with appropriate noise levels transfer to real robots and real situations (see e.g. Jakobi [5], Miglino et al. [8]). Jakobi ([5], <ref> [4] </ref>) has formalised the use of noise for facilitating transference by distinguishing between base set features (those aspects of an agent-environment system that may come to play a part in the eventual behaviour) and implementation features (those aspects which are either simulation artefacts, or not relevant to the behaviour, or just <p> world evolution can be reduced to very short periods of simulated evolution, without the sacrifice of real-world efficacy. 4 The simulation In order for the evolved behaviours to work in the real world, and to permit the incorporation of quantitatively specifiable amounts of noise, Jakobi's `minimal simulation' methodology was followed <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> In order to simulate these factors, three look-up tables were employed (adapted from <ref> [4] </ref>). One held the values that IR sensors would (roughly) hold if the robot were to be positioned at 10cm from an infinitely long flat wall. This table consisted of values for all 8 IR sensors, for each of 10 robot orientations from 0 to =2. <p> Fig. 3. A real khepera about its business, controlled by a network evolved in a very noisy simulation. Successful transfer to reality was consistently observed when networks from the fittest robots, evolved in noisy conditions, were downloaded onto real Khep-eras (see Jakobi <ref> [4] </ref> for further examples of successful transference using the same simulation methodology).

It is demonstrated that large amounts of simulation noise promote the evolution of robots with relatively complex behaviours and neural dynamics compared to those evolved in simulations with low noise levels. <p> in the present context, may be considered in terms of evolutionary dynamics. 6.1 How do these results relate to robustness? In section 5.1 it was observed that networks evolved in non-noisy environments did not transfer effectively to the real world (this, however, was to be expected from Jakobi et. al <ref> [6] </ref>). One effect of noise is therefore to endow the evolving networks with real-world robustness. Indeed, one way to understand the results presented here is that robustness is being achieved through evolution exploiting the properties of a qualitatively different, more complex, behaviour.

Reference-contexts: Both these ideas are new to evolutionary robotics, but the former builds on previous work (Seth, <ref> [10] </ref>), in which noise is shown to promote the evolution of strategies of increasing complexity in co-evolving Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma ecologies. In these studies, the `evolved complexity' is reflected in the strategies deployed by the agents, which in turn is reflected in the lengths of variable length genotypes.
