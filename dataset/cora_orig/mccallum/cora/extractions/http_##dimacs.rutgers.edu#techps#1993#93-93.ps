Abstract: Let us draw a graph R on f0; 1; : : : ; n 1g by having an edge fi; jg with probability p jijj , where P i p i &lt; 1, and let M n = (n; &lt;; R). For a first order sentence let a n be the probability of M n j= . We prove that

Reference-contexts: The probability is derived from the probability distribution for R (which does not appear in the model.) 1.7 Theory Assume p n = 1 n a , where 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 (like <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref>). Then K opo satisfies the very weak zero one law.
