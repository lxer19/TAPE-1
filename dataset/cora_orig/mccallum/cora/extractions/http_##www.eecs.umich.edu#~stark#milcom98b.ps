Abstract: It is well known that a communication system using M-ary orthogonal signaling in additive white Gaussian noise can achieve capacity. However, in a worst case partial band jamming channel, orthogonal signaling fails to achieve capacity. In this paper, we show that a M-ary orthogonal system using coding and side information provides reliable communications in partial band jamming. In particular, the system can achieve capacity by using the ratio threshold test (RTT) to convert all errors due to the channel into erasures. For the worst case jamming scenario, the minimum E b =N J needed for error-free communications is shown to be 4 ln 2 (4:43 dB). The optimum code rate that minimizes E b =N J is 1=2. With hard decision decoding, the minimum E b =N J needed for error-free communications is 8 ln 2 (7:44 dB) with the optimum code rate at 1=4. Hence, asymptotically, the typical 3 dB gain obtained by using soft decisions is observed. Moreover, this gain in performance does not require additional information from the transmitter; RTT generates its side information entirely at the receiver.

Reference-contexts: Since more erasures can be corrected than errors, side information improves performance by identifying symbols that have been jammed and declaring these as erasures. To measure the reliability of the received symbols, the ratio threshold test <ref> [1] </ref> is used to generate side information. RTT differs from other techniques in that it generates its side information entirely from the received symbols; RTT does not require any additional information from the transmitter. <p> From (18), we see that the integrand x M2 (1 x) ffi 2 1 x M2 (1 x) i 2 1 for x 2 <ref> [1 ; 1] </ref>. Hence, since the integrand for fl = ffi is positive valued and the integral is upper bounded by 0, it too must be 0.

Reference-contexts: The use of RTT to generate side information has been considered in various channels ([1]-[3]). In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic performance of Reed-Solomon (RS) coded orthogonal signaling with RTT in a partial band jamming environment. It was shown in <ref> [4] </ref> that M-ary orthogonal signaling does not achieve reliable communications in a jamming channel except at infinite signal to noise ratios. We will show that with coding, error-free communications can be achieved over the worst case partial band jamming environment.

Reference-contexts: For hard decisions, the probability of error is: lim P e (1) = ae E b &lt; ln 2 0 E b &gt; ln 2 (7) which matches what is obtained in <ref> [6] </ref> for the additive white Gaussian noise channel. The analysis for fl &gt; 1 is much more difficult. In the Appendix, it is shown that when RTT is used lim P e (fl) = 0 for E b =N J &gt; ln 2 for any fl threshold greater than 1.

Reference-contexts: In the Appendix, it is shown that when RTT is used lim P e (fl) = 0 for E b =N J &gt; ln 2 for any fl threshold greater than 1. Note that this result matches what was found for the Rayleigh fading case in <ref> [7] </ref>. Finally, the asymptotic probability of symbol erasure can be obtained from P er (fl) = 1P c (fl)P e (fl). This gives: P er (fl) = &lt; ae ln 2 N J rae N J &gt; fl 2 ln 2 (8) for fl &gt; 1.
