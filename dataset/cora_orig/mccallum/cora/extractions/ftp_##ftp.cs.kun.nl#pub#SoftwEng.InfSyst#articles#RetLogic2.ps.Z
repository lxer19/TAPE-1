Abstract: In this paper we introduce Index Expressions as a means for modelling document content. From an index expression the the Power Index Expression can be derived, which is a powerful instrument for information retrieval. We describe the characterization of documents in the style of formal logic. The content of a document is then modelled by a set of axioms, of which the document is a model. Relating a document to a query is done by proving the query from the axioms of that document. We introduce three rules of inference. If such a proof is not possible, the relevance of the document for the query is derived by plausible deduction. We introduce two inference rules for plausible deduction.

The basis task is to detect a tree representation in the heading. After the removal of stopwords the remaining tokens are successively processed. In the case of a connector token, its priority is used to decide whether the current tree is to be deepened, or broadened.

Reference-contexts: Some believe that the limits of exploitation of statistical models have been reached [Rij86a]. Quite a considerable amount of recent research in document retrieval has been directed at incorporating document semantics in the hope of achieving more effective retrieval [SvR90] [Wea88] <ref> [BC89] </ref>. 3.1 The Meaning of Documents The crucial questions in regard to semantics in document retrieval concern how the meaning of a document should be represented, and given that the meaning is available, how can it be used to produce more effective retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval operation must retrieve all documents that are relevant to the searcher's information need. This is a simple statement but in fact very difficult to realize. An underlying problem in regard to relevance is that the information need of the searcher seems not to be formalizeable. In <ref> [Bla90] </ref> research is cited which concludes that searchers can consistently determine relevance of a document without being able to concretize the criteria they use for this. This phenomenon has been compared to how people can recognize faces without being able to explain how.

Reference-contexts: We follow a logic-based approach along the lines of [Rij89] (see also <ref> [BvdW91] </ref>). A document is assumed to have a formal semantics in the form of a set of so called axioms. Each axiom describes or characterizes a part of the document content.

Reference-contexts: The only reasonable assumption seems to be to equate the information need N with the request q. This assumption underlied the historical Cranfield experiments in document retrieval and has continued to be made within document retrieval research up to this day, although not always without some disagreement <ref> [Coo71] </ref>. In this article, we assume equivalence between request and information need. The notion of relevance between document and request is encapsulated in a retrieval operation which is defined in terms of of logical deduction.

Reference-contexts: In an index expression descriptor the relationships between the terms are mod-elled. The motivation behind this is that much of the meaning of a document is embodied in term relationships <ref> [Far80] </ref>. A parallel can be drawn here with the conceptual model from the database world where relationship types between entities play an important role. With respect to this parallel a content model of a document consisting simply of keywords would be like an entity relationship model with no relationship types.

Reference-contexts: the request and to what extent? More precisely, what is the probability of D being a model of q? 10 Bruza and Van der Weide 4 Index Expressions as Basis for a Formal Theory In logic a formal theory consists of symbols, well formed formulas, axioms and rules of inference <ref> [MG87] </ref>. An example of a formal theory is the propositional calculus, where the symbols comprise letters representing propositions together with symbols denoting certain logical operators. The well formed formulae (which includes the axioms) are built up in the usual way and there is one rule of inference, called modus ponens.

Reference-contexts: One could of course add the request to the axiom set but how much of an extension would this constitute? In another approach a knowledge base could be used <ref> [Nie86] </ref>. It has even been suggested that the user supplies the extra semantics [Rij89]. The approach adopted here exploits the structural properties of the index expressions to support axiom extension. Instead of adding index expressions to the axiom set, the existing axioms are strengthened by an operation called refinement.

Reference-contexts: The most elementary form of descriptor is a keyword, or term. Term descriptors have the advantage that there are a number of straightforward indexing methods to derive them from documents <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. The disadvantage of terms is that they sometimes lack discriminatory power. This is particularly true in large document bases. A term phrase is an extension of term descriptors to increase their speci The Modelling and Retrieval of Documents using Index Expressions 3 ficity and thus their ability for discrimination. <p> In general, a term phrase is a series of two or more terms. The most common term phrases consist of two terms. Even though straight forward indexing methods exist for the generation of term phrases <ref> [Sal89] </ref>, these methods often suffer from the problem that either too many non-meaningful phrases are generated, or conversely a large percentage of the phrases are meaningful but the resulting content models lack exhaustivity. 2.2 Index Expression Descriptors An extension to the term phrases are the so called index expressions. <p> The effectiveness of retrieval strongly relies on the measure to which discriminating terms are used to characterize documents. The assumption is that discriminating terms are ones which occur relatively frequently within a document and do not occur frequently in other documents <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. The statistical-based retrieval models have the inherent limitation that they do not in any substantial way incorporate the notion of document meaning. Much of the research in document retrieval over the last thirty years has been directed at maximizing effectiveness within this limitation.
