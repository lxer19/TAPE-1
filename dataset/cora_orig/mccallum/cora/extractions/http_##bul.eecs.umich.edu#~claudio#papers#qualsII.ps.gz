Reference-contexts: Mean scatterer spacing (MSS) has been recognized as a tool for tissue characterization for certain kinds of tissues and diseases <ref> [1] </ref>. Furthermore, it has recently been shown to be a valuable tool for non-invasive estimation of temperature change caused by an externally applied heating field [6]. Many authors assume that for certain tissues the echo is reflected from two different types of structures. <p> The former are usually referred to as regular scatterers and the later as diffuse scatterers. Fellingham and Sommer <ref> [1] </ref> showed a good agreement between this model and the actual tissue histological architecture for the cases of human liver and spleen. Normal human liver tissue is organized into small histologic units (the classic lobule) which correspond to the regular scatterers in this model. <p> These characteristics are present in both the amplitude and the phase of the spectra. Most of the mean scatterer spacing estimation techniques described in the literature can be classified into one of two major groups: those which only use the information contained in the amplitude of the spectra <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] </ref>, and those which explore the redundancy present in both the amplitude and the phase of the spectra [8, 9, 10, 11]. <p> Fellingham and Sommer <ref> [1] </ref> used the histogram of the peak of the autocorrelation of the magnitude of the spectra computed through an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of the echo. In their work, they used two different transducers, one of them being wide-band and the other being narrow-band. <p> Consider the case when &gt;> &gt; 0, so that 5 we can assume that negative distances will be very unlikely and will be ignored. In practice will correspond to distances on the order of 1mm and typical values for are on the order of =10 <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. <p> The PSD of the echo signal can now be computed using equation (2.3). Fig. 2.1d shows the PSD of the echo assuming typical values for the transducer (central frequency=3.5MHz, half power bandwidth=2.0MHz) and for the tissue semi-regular lattice (MSS=c=2=1.0mm, c=2=0.1mm, c=speed of sound=1540m/s) <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. If we now consider the MSS estimation problem, we want to detect the harmonic peaks. <p> As shown by simulations in chapter 5, this turns out to be more robust than the algorithms that only use the information present in the magnitude of the spectra of the echo <ref> [1] </ref>, jF (x (t))j, or even the AR/cepstrum approach suggested by Wear et al. [5].

Kuc and co-workers in <ref> [2] </ref> and Landini and Verrazzani in [4] suggested using the cepstrum of the magnitude of the spectra (instead of the autocorrelation), which converts the multiplicative effect of the transducer response into an additive effect, eliminating the need for normalization.

The regular scatterers are spatially distributed according to a Gamma distribution, as suggested in <ref> [4, 11] </ref> with a given mean and standard deviation .

They compared these two approaches and concluded that for short data lengths (about 4mm for a MSS of 2.54mm) the AR-Burg performs better than the periodogram approach. <p> Varghese and Donohue in [10] introduced what they called the spectral autocorrelation (SAC) technique as being a more robust tool to estimate the MSS. They showed that the SAC estimates converge more reliably than the AR/cepstrum approach (used by Wear and co-workers <ref> [5] </ref>) over smaller amounts of data, as the 2 SAC takes into account the phase information, in contrast with the phase-less power spectral density used by the AR/cepstrum approach. <p> As shown by simulations in chapter 5, this turns out to be more robust than the algorithms that only use the information present in the magnitude of the spectra of the echo [1], jF (x (t))j, or even the AR/cepstrum approach suggested by Wear et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. In fact, in the frequency domain, the suggested method corresponds to the complex autocorrelation of the spectra of the echo, F (x 2 (t)) = F (x (t)) F (x (t)); (3.7) where stands for cross-correlation.

Based on simulation results, it was shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that by using such a criterion it is possible to select only the best estimates of the MSS, reducing the standard deviation of the accepted estimates. <p> The number of harmonic candidates preserved in Step 2 is used as a quality index for the reliability of the MSS estimate. The MSS estimate is accepted only if this number is greater than a predetermined threshold K. It was shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that by using the quality index defined in such a way, it was possible to reduce the standard deviation of the accepted estimates of the MSS. 9 10 11 Chapter 3 The Squaring Algorithm Cyclostationarity A signal x (t) is said to be second-order cyclostationary if and only if it <p> The MSS value is then obtained by the relation MSS=(c=2)=f 1 , where f 1 = ! 1 =2 is the detected peak frequency. The complete algorithm is given in Fig. 3.2. In analogy to what was done for the AR/Peaks algorithm in <ref> [7] </ref>, it is possible to define a quality index for the squaring algorithm also. The ratio between the magnitude of the dominant peak of the FFT of the squared signal and the second highest peak was taken as the quality index for this case.

In Chapter 4 we briefly describe the frequency smoothed SAC algorithm, which was shown to be more reliable than previous algorithms found in the literature <ref> [11] </ref>, and how it uses the information contained in the bi-frequency plane. In Chapter 5 a model for simulations is described, and the proposed algorithms are compared to the AR/Cepstrum and the SAC in terms of reliability and robustness. <p> The different techniques are compared in terms of robustness and computational efficiency in the discussion section of Chapter 8, followed by conclusions and suggestions for future work. 4 Chapter 2 The AR/Peaks Algorithm Motivation It was shown in <ref> [6, 11] </ref> that the power spectral density (PSD) of the echo of a perfectly regular tissue will present peaks at the harmonic frequencies f k = kf 1 , k = 1; 2; 3; : : :. <p> Then we will have x (t) = a (t) fl p (t); (2.1) where fl stands for convolution and a (t) = n=1 where t n is a random process.

Varghese and Donohue <ref> [11] </ref> analyzed the phase distribution of S (f 1 ; f 2 ) along diagonals in the bi-frequency plane. They found that the phase along diagonals ff = 1= present some regularity within the bandpass of the transducer. <p> The MSS is then obtained using the relationship MSS=(c=2)=ff 1 . 17 Chapter 5 Simulations Simulation Model The model used for simulations assumes two types of scatterers, the regular and the diffuse.

Reference-contexts: Two different phantoms were built in order to further characterize the performance of the MSS estimation techniques. The first uses copper wires that are approximately equally spaced, and the second uses a recent technology for building phantoms using thin films <ref> [12] </ref>. Both phantoms are fully described in Chapter 6, together with the results obtained for each of the MSS estimation techniques. Chapter 7 describes the in vitro experiments conducted using pig liver, and the results obtained for the squaring algorithm. <p> This procedure was able to correctly select 9 of the MSS estimates, whose values ranged in between 2.48 and 2.58mm. Transparency Phantom A new method for building ultrasonic phantoms using thin film techniques has been recently suggested by Phillips and Parker <ref> [12] </ref>. In a first stage, the phantom can be built by preparing an image with the desired scatterers and printing it on overhead transparency using a conventional 300dpi laser printer.

Reference-contexts: The filter coefficients were chosen based on the autoregressive characteristic of ultrasonic transducers. The impulse response of the transducer was modeled by a low model order Yule-Walker autoregressive (AR) model <ref> [13] </ref>: a = R 1 r; (2.11) where R is the autocorrelation matrix, r is the autocorrelation vector, a = [a 1 ; a 2 ; a 3 ; : : :; a p ] 0 is the vector of the AR model coefficients, and p is the model order. <p> The 7 FIR filter was implemented as: y (n) = k=0 where x (n) is the echo signal, y (n) is the pre-filtered echo, and a 0 = 1. The pre-filtered signal was modeled using a higher order least squares autoregressive model <ref> [13] </ref> and the estimated spectrum calculated. The least squares method was chosen in this case to highlight the peaks that are present in the spectra. The N strongest peak frequencies were identified as harmonic candidates h n .

Reference-contexts: In order to evaluate the power spectral density (PSD) of the signal x (t) we first compute the PSD of the wide-sense stationary (WSS) signal a (t) and then consider p (t) as being the impulse response of a linear time-invariant system, so that we can use the result <ref> [16] </ref>: S x (!) = S a (!)jP (!)j 2 : (2.3) To derive the expression for the autocorrelation of a (t), let assume that there is a regular scatterer at t = 0.

Reference-contexts: They also studied several kernel shapes by varying the length and the beta factor of a Kaiser window <ref> [18] </ref>, and based on simulations they concluded that best performance was achieved with a rectangular window whose length is larger than 87% of the transducer -4dB bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Human liver does also present this structure. It is believed that this structure is responsible for the regular scatterers present in the ultrasonic image. In the pig, and a few other species, differently from the human and cow liver, there is connective tissue separating each lobule from its neighbors <ref> [19] </ref>. Consequently it is much easier to visually identify the histologic structure. Due to this characteristic, pig liver was chosen for this preliminary study. A fresh pig liver sample was immersed in water and imaged using the two-dimensional system described before.
