Title: THE FLOODLIGHT PROBLEM  
Author: Prosenjit Bose Leonidas Guibas Anna Lubiw Mark Overmars Diane Souvaine Jorge Urrutia 
Abstract: Given three angles summing to 2, given n points in the plane and a tripartition k 1 + k 2 + k 3 = n, we can tripartition the plane into three wedges of the given angles so that the i-th wedge contains k i of the points. This new result on dissecting point sets is used to prove that lights of specified angles not exceeding can be placed at n fixed points in the plane to illuminate the entire plane if and only if the angles sum to at least 2. We give O(n log n) algorithms for both these problems.

Reference-contexts: , is less than or equal to the sum of the angles of the lights, ff 00 .) Note that this proof is algorithmic: we can find the line l in O (k) time using median finding 4 r W ' s l a q a q a ' ' <ref> [BFP] </ref>, and then we have decomposed the problem into two subproblems of half the size. Thus the total time required is O (k log k). <p> We must position r 2 so that k 2 points of R lie in W 2 . This constraint gives a range l 0 2 of possible lines for r 2 . We can find l 0 2 using a linear time selection algorithm <ref> [BFP] </ref>. Similarly, we must position r 3 so that k 1 points of L lie in W 1 , and we obtain a range l 0 3 of possible lines for r 3 . See Figure 2.7.

Reference-contexts: The usual scenario is that we have some target objects in two or more dimensions that are to be illuminated, and some specified sites for lights, which are assumed to shine light in every direction|i.e. with an angle of illumination of 360 ffi in the planar case.

Reference-contexts: Tokuyama and Nakano proved that tripartitioning is always possible in this case, and gave an efficient randomized algorithm. In [TN2] they generalized to weighted points. A number of results have been obtained since our initial work. Czyzowicz, Rivera-Campo, and Urrutia <ref> [CRCU2] </ref> gave a nice and efficient algorithm for a variant of the Stage Light problem in which one may choose the angles of the lights|again placing the lights at fixed points to illuminate a line segment|with the goal of minimizing the total sum of the angles used.

Reference-contexts: The special case where the i 's are equal was proved earlier in [TN1], generalized to higher dimensions. Our tripartition result fits into a large family of results on dissections of point sets, of which the most famous is the Ham Sandwich Theorem (see <ref> [E, Chapter 4] </ref>). We give O (n log n) algorithms for tripartitioning, and for the floodlight problem. Our model of computation is the real RAM (see [PS]). Other Work Tokuyama and Nakano [TN1] proved the special case of the tripartitioning result when the three given angles are equal. <p> Note that the theorem includes the case of bipartitioning, by uniting two of the wedges into one. Theorem 2.3 has the same flavour as many other results on dissecting point sets|see Chapter 4 of Edelsbrunner's book <ref> [E] </ref>. As for many of those results, a continuous version is also true: we can replace the discrete point set by a convex body whose area must be tripartitioned into specified portions by specified angles. Proof of Theorem 2.3.
