Title: TCP and Explicit Congestion Notification  
Author: Sally Floyd

Affiliation: Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory  
Abstract: This paper discusses the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanisms in the TCP/IP protocol. The first part proposes new guidelines for TCP's response to ECN mechanisms (e.g., Source Quench packets, ECN fields in packet headers). Next, using simulations, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of ECN in TCP/IP networks. Our simulations use RED gateways modified to set an ECN bit in the IP packet header as an indication of congestion, with Reno-style TCP modified to respond to ECN as well as to packet drops as indications of congestion. The simulations show that one advantage of ECN mechanisms is in avoiding unnecessary packet drops, and therefore avoiding unnecessary delay for packets from low-bandwidth delay-sensitive TCP connections. A second advantage of ECN mechanisms is in networks (generally LANs) where the effectiveness of TCP retransmit timers is limited by the coarse granularity of the TCP clock. The paper also discusses some implementation issues concerning specific ECN mechanisms in TCP/IP networks.

Reference-contexts: These Flow Labels could facilitate the use by gateways of separate queues or scheduling algorithms for the different traffic classes <ref> [BCS94, F93] </ref>. The use of a separate traffic class for interactive traffic would reduce packet drops for this traffic during periods of low demand from the interactive traffic. However, for both attended data transfer and interactive traffic, some notification of congestion from the gateways will continue to be required.

Reference-contexts: introduction of priority-based scheduling or of Fair-Queueing-based scheduling at the gateways could complicate the traffic dynamics of TCP traffic in future net works. As an example of possible changes, the proposed IPng header <ref> [H94] </ref> contains a Flow Label with a 4-bit Traffic Class field identifying seven classes of flow-controlled (e.g., TCP) traffic, including classes for unattended data transfer such as email, attended data transfer such as FTP, interactive traffic such as telnet, and interactive control traffic such as SNMP. <p> For a wide-area network the overhead of Source Quench messages makes their use problematic. However, the logistical difficulties of adding ECN fields to IP packet headers makes the use of ECN fields problematic as well. The proposed IPng packet header <ref> [H94] </ref> has no space allocated for an ECN field, and it is not clear if IPng options, with a minimum length of 8 octets, would be an appropriate place for an ECN field.

Reference-contexts: However, in the current algorithms for setting the TCP retransmit timer, the coarse granularity for the TCP clock is deliberately used as a low-pass filter to filter out common traffic variations <ref> [J88] </ref>. This filtering implicitly accounts for common traffic dynamics such as interactions between local and long haul traffic. Changing to an arbitrarily-fine-grained TCP clock (e.g., considerably smaller than 100 msec) would remove this filtering, resulting in false retransmits in many scenarios.

Reference-contexts: This coarse-grained TCP clock limits the granularity of TCP's measurements of current roundtrip times, used to determine the value for the retransmit timer. The simulation results in this paper, along with other results <ref> [RF94] </ref>, argue in favor of improving the granularity of TCP clocks. Unfortunately, even if there were no hardware considerations, and TCP designers could set the TCP clock granularity to the optimal value, it is not obvious what that optimal value should be.
