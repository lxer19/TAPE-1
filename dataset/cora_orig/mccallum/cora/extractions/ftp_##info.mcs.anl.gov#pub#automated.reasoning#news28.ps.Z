Abstract: In keeping with our objective of having the AAR Newsletter serve as a forum for discussion of innovative techniques as well as controversial issues related to automated reasoning, we feature here three articles. * The second, by Ranan Banerji, presents a new algorithm that efficiently tests theories for membership in certain decidable classes. We welcome such articles and hope that readers will find the AAR Newsletter a useful mechanism for publishing such results. I would like to request the help of the readers of the AAR Newsletter in the matter of changing the way CADE, the conference on automated deduction, is organized. Currently, all power in CADE rests in the hands of the CADE trustees, who consist of the past four program committee chairs, future already-chosen program chairs, others whom the trustees may choose to add to this committee, and the secretary and treasurer, currently 9 persons in all. Also, the trustees choose CADE program committee chairs. Therefore, as you can see, there is no democratic element at all in the current system. The program committee, the CADE conference attendees, and the members of the Association for Automated Reasoning have no voice at all in the management of CADE (except as the trustees may choose to consider it). It is true that the current trustees have shown themselves receptive to the opinions of the program committee, but there is no guarantee that this will continue. There is also the possibility that the CADE system could be adopted by other organizations (such as RTA). I propose that a more democratic system be adopted, similar to that of the Association for Logic Programming, and that an election by the members of the Association for Automated Reasoning and recent CADE attendees be held to determine whether the current system should be continued or whether a democratic system should be adopted.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to consider the fact, however, that more general classes of interpretation may be useful in increasing the efficiency of refutation. In some cases one can choose these interpretations in such a way that unsatisfiability becomes decidable. Leitsch et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have isolated a class of theories where such interpretations can be found, thus proving the decidability of certain classes of theories. The purpose of the present paper is to design an efficient algorithm for testing theories for membership in one of these classes. <p> These definitions follow Ref. <ref> [1] </ref>. What follows are a slightly weaker form of a definition in Section 3.6 in [2] and a slightly weaker and modified form of Theorem 6.1 therein. 5 Definition 2.3 Let m be a setting. <p> For some classes of theory m can be so chosen that all m-deductions are finite so that the theory becomes decidable. In what follows we describe such a class. The definition is according to <ref> [1] </ref>, with minor rewordings to suit the present purpose. Definition 2.4 Given a set of clauses S a setting m is called adequate for S iff 1. All false clauses in S are ground. 2. <p> Theorem 2.2 <ref> [1] </ref> If S is a PVD set of clauses and m is adequate for S, then all m-deductions from S is finite, that is, PVD classes of clauses are decidable. For Theorem 2.2 to be applicable one has to find an adequate setting for it. <p> With careful data structuring, some of the searches can be carried out in log time. 4 Comments Thus one class of decidable theories can be tested in polynomial time. However, that does not mean that this entire class of theories can be decided in polynomial time. In <ref> [1] </ref> the authors show that the PVD class is wide enough to include some theories whose decision is reducible to NP-hard problems. Acknowledgments The author is indebted to Prof. Alexander Leitsch for many very illuminating discussions. Internet was of great help in making this interaction possible.
