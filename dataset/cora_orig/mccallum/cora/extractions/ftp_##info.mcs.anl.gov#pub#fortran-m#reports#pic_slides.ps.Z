Title: Two important considerations in considering different ap proaches: How easy is it to express the
Note: SU Y ND CONCLUSIONS  
Abstract: How good is the performance? So far we have only looked at the performance of the gather and scatter steps Thread based implementation should improve perfor mance Important factor is how easy is it to control the granularity of communication. If processes are sufficiently light-weight and memory is cheap, we would like many small processes that buffer all their communication till the end of a processing step. Fortran M runtime system can manage overlap of communication and calculation.
