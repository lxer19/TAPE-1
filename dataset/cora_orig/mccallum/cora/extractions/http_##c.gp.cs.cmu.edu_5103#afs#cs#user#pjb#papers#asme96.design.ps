Abstract: We are currently fabricating a haptic interface device to enable direct physical interaction with dynamic simulated three-dimensional environments by exerting and reacting to forces and motions between the user's hand and a magnetically levitated object. Our device uses magnetic levitation rather than a motorized linkage so that the dynamics are simple and actuator nonlinearities such as hysteresis, backlash and static friction are eliminated. Magnetic levitation haptic interaction was previously demonstrated using a fine motion robot wrist. A new magnetic levitation device was then designed specifically to address the requirements of realistic tool-based haptic interaction. A hemispherical device shape was adopted to maximize the ranges of translation and rotation and the ratio of actuator surface area to the levitated mass while enabling the user to grip a tool handle at the hemisphere center, near the center of mass, where translation, rotation, force, and torque ranges are the same in all directions. The new device will have a motion range of at least 12 mm and 7 ffi , position sensing resolution within 3 m, and will be capable of generating peak forces up to 60 N. Preliminary results from testing of position sensors and actuator assemblies support the performance data obtained from model analysis.

Reference-contexts: Early examples of haptic interface devices were generally backdriven serial robot manipulators that had disadvantages of mechanical friction and backlash, low bandwidth, and large bulk and weight as well as being difficult and tiring to use <ref> [1] </ref>. Much better performance has been obtained with parallel actuated devices using tensioned cables and/or lightweight, smooth mechanical linkages [2, 3]. An especially successful example of this type of device is the "PHANToM" from SensAble Devices, Inc [4].

The Lorentz force has been proposed as a superior actuation means for haptic interface devices <ref> [5] </ref>. Lorentz force actuation is generated by electric currents in a magnetic field. This method of non-contact actuation is simple and compact. It enables high control bandwidths and resolutions while eliminating many shortcomings of motor drives and linkages such as friction, hysteresis, and backlash.

This device has a position bandwidth of over 50 Hz with a 1000 Hz control cycle and position resolution high enough to enable surprisingly realistic haptic interaction involving hard polygonal contacts, friction, and surface texture.
