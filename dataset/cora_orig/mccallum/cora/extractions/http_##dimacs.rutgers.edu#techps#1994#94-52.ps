Reference-contexts: Such isomorphic triangulations of R p and R q are called joint triangulations in [3] and compatible triangulations in <ref> [1] </ref>. Triangulations t p and t q define a piecewise linear homeomorphism h between R p and R q as follows.

Reference-contexts: This paper shows that in the worst case at most O (n 2 ) vertices are required and gives an O (n 2 ) algorithm for constructing a homeomorphism of that size.

A recent result of Pach, Shahrokhi and Szegedy implies that such a construction is optimal in the worst case; i.e., there exist point sets for which any isomorphic triangulations and piecewise linear homeomorphism have size (n 2 ) <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Their primary drawback is their lack of smoothness between pieces and the possibility of unnecessarily introducing large angular distortion. Nevertheless, their innate simplicity recommends them for constructing homeomorphisms between complex regions or for constructing homeomorphisms under many constraints. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Saalfeld proposed using piecewise linear homeomorphisms for map conflation, the process of merging cartographic maps. <p> Such isomorphic triangulations of R p and R q are called joint triangulations in <ref> [3] </ref> and compatible triangulations in [1]. Triangulations t p and t q define a piecewise linear homeomorphism h between R p and R q as follows. For every vertex v 2 t p corresponding to vertex v 0 2 t q , let h (v) = v 0 . <p> The map h is a piecewise linear homeomorphism from R p to R q . In <ref> [3] </ref>, Saalfeld gives a method for constructing isomorphic triangulations between the convex hull of a point set P = fp 1 ; : : : ; p n g and Q = fq 1 ; : : : ; q n g such that p i and q i are corresponding
