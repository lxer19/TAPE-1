Abstract: In this work, we investigate the visual appearance of real-world surfaces and the dependence of appearance on imaging conditions. We present a BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) database with reflectance measurements for over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions. We fit the BRDF measurements to two recent models to obtain a BRDF parameter database. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. Finally, we present a BTF (bidirectional texture function) database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions. Each of these unique databases has important implications for a variety of vision algorithms and each is made publicly available.

Reference-contexts: These images have 640x480 pixels with 24 bits per pixel (8 bits per R/G/B channel). The pixel values are converted to radiance values using a post-processing calibration and segmentation scheme described in <ref> [4] </ref>. The calibrated, segmented images serve as the BTF measurements and these images are averaged to obtain the BRDF measurements. The need to vary the viewing and source directions over the entire hemisphere of possible directions presents a practical obstacle in the measurements. <p> Linear estimation was used to fit the truncated series to the BRDF measurements. Plots for the entire set of fitting results are too numerous to include here and are provided in <ref> [4] </ref>. The samples included here were chosen to be representative of the overall results. These samples are 11-plaster, 12-rough paper, 49-concrete, 25-quarry tile, 43-salt crystals, and 36-limestone. The measurements and modeling results are depicted in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: Our BRDF parameter database, obtained by fitting the measurements to the Oren-Nayar model and the Koenderink et al. decomposition, can be used in place of the popular Lambertian reflectance model in such algorithms as shape-from-shading <ref> [6] </ref> and photometric stereo [21]. Since these algorithms rely on a reflectance model to ascertain shape, inaccuracies of the Lamber-tian model can significantly affect their performance. The model parameters can also be used instead of popular shading models [5],[2] for photorealistic rendering of real-world surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Our large database allows us to evaluate the performance of known models. Specifically, the measurements are fit to two existing analytical representations: the Oren-Nayar model [13] for surfaces with isotropic roughness and the Koenderink et al. decomposition <ref> [8] </ref> for both anisotropic and isotropic surfaces. Our fitting results form a concise BRDF parameter database that is also publicly available at www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/curet. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis.

Reference-contexts: Consequently the corresponding rendered sphere shows a horizontal bright region due to the surface geometry. 5 Fitting to BRDF Models A concise description is required for functional utility of the measurements. We employ the Oren-Nayar model [13] and the Koenderink et al. representation <ref> [9] </ref> to obtain parametric descriptions of the BRDF measurement database. The resulting database of parameters can be used directly in a variety of algorithms where accurate, concise and analytical reflectance descriptions are needed. In vision, these applications include shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. <p> Because of the varying surface normals across the sample, foreshortening effects are quite complicated and cannot be accounted for by common texture-mapping techniques. A detailed discussion of the pitfalls of current texture rendering schemes is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider the same sample shown under two different sets of illumination and viewing directions in Figure 7.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the rendered velvet sphere gives a convincing impression of velvet. The rendered spheres of plaster (Sample 30) and roofing shingle (Sample 32) show a fairly flat appearance which is quite different from the Lambertian prediction for such matte objects, but is consistent with <ref> [12] </ref> and [13]. Concrete (Sample 49) and salt crystals (Sample 43) also show a somewhat flat appearance, while rough paper (Sample 31) is more Lambertian. The plush rug (Sample 19) and moss (Sample 61), have similar reflectance patterns as one would expect from the similarities of their geometry.

Reference-contexts: As illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 7, surface roughness causes notable effects on the BTF which are not considered by current texture algorithms. Present algorithms for shape-from-texture [14],[16],[10], texture segmentation [22],[10] and texture recognition <ref> [15] </ref> are only suitable for 2D textures, i.e. planar texture due to albedo variation. Texture rendering also typically assumes a 2D planar texture that is mapped to a 3D surface. When the surface is rough, the rendering tends to be too flat and unrealistic.
