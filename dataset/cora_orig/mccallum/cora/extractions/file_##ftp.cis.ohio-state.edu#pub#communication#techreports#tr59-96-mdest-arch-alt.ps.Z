Reference-contexts: The architectures proposed in the current paper allow multicast for packets as large as the buffer size at the switches and the technique works well for both long and short messages. Andrews et al <ref> [1] </ref> have proposed a method for tree based multicast using bit-string encoding in the context of dance-hall architectures. However this work only focuses on store and forward networks and short message lengths. Some parallel systems like the CM-5 [19], Meiko CS2 [4] etc. provide facilities for multicasting.

Reference-contexts: All of these systems are being used to support either the distributed-memory or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. For efficient support of either paradigm, these systems require fast collective communication <ref> [2, 24] </ref> support, as defined by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) Standard, from the underlying communication subsystem. Among the set of collective communication operations, broadcast and multicast are quite fundamental and they get used in several other operations like barrier synchronization and reduction [30].
