Abstract: Technical Report CSRP-98-13 Abstract In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an interactive system which allows users to evolve short musical sequences using interactive genetic programming, and its extensions aimed at making the system fully automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of functions for creating musical sequences, and a user interface which allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this user interactive technique it was possible to generate pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive systems, the system takes rating data from a users run and uses it to train a neural network based automatic rater, or auto rater, which can replace the user in bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make runs of up to 50 generations with 500 individuals per generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as nice as those generated in user interactive runs.

Reference-contexts: As a fitness function they used a neural network trained on real responses from known jazz pieces, and tried to get the system to generate good responses. Unfortunately it was not very successful since the neural network did not have an adequate amount of training on poor responses. Biles <ref> [1] </ref> designed the GenJam system which uses Genetic Algorithms. It evolves measures, and phrases (which are a series of measures) simultaneously in a real time fashion. As the user listens to a stream of phrases and measures, they type `b' for bad or `g' for good.

Reference-contexts: Auto-raters are described in Section 4. Experimental results with the GP-Music system with and without auto-raters are described in Section 5. We draw some conclusions and indicate directions for future work in Section 6. 2 Related Work AI based attempts at music composition are Cope's EMI <ref> [2] </ref> and Todd's Connectionist Approach [9]. Cope created an expert system which was attuned to his own style of composition and was able to use it to create perturbations of a theme for use throughout a larger composition.

Reference-contexts: The accumulation of `g's and `b's serves as the fitness for the measures. This is interactive GA, and the author reports that although some decent phrases eventually begin to emerge, the process is tedious. Another system using GAs is Neurogen <ref> [3] </ref>. It used a three stage approach where rhythm is first created, and then added in with melody, and finally combined with other phrases to create a harmony.

Reference-contexts: The basic parameters used for the experimental runs were similar to those suggested by Koza in <ref> [6] </ref>. Individuals were selected for reproduction using 4 individual tournament selection. The genetic operators were crossover, reproduction, and mutation with probabilities 0.7, 0.15 and 0.15, respectively. Six generations were used with a generation size of 16.

Reference-contexts: Instead a human using the system is asked to rate the musical sequences that are created for each generation of the GP process. This is similar to Poli's <ref> [7] </ref> system for evolving pseudo-coloring algorithms. The user rates the individual sequences using a simple list style X-Windows interface.

Reference-contexts: Using a feedback system, the network is able to continue a composition based on previous notes. Several attempts have also been made to apply Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming to music composition. Spector and Alpern <ref> [8] </ref> came up with a GP system which evolved responses to call phrases in jazz pieces. As a fitness function they used a neural network trained on real responses from known jazz pieces, and tried to get the system to generate good responses.
