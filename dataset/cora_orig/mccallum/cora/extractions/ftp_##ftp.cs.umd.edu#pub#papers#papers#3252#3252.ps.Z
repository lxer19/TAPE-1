Abstract: We study resource synchronization in multiprocessor hard real-time systems. Specifically, we propose a multiprocessor resource control protocol which allows a job to simultaneously lock multiple global resources, removing a restriction from previous protocols. Allowing nested critical sections may permit a finer granularity of synchronization, increasing parallelism and throughput. All the protocols discussed belong to the class of priority inheritance protocols and rely in some fashion on priority ceilings for global semaphores. We consider both static and dynamic priorities, building upon the multiprocessor priority ceiling protocol (MPCP) proposed by Rajkumar et al. and the dynamic priority ceiling protocol (DPCP) proposed by Chen and Lin. The extended protocols prevent deadlock and transitive blocking. We derive bounds for worse case blocking time, and describe sufficient conditions to guarantee that m sets of periodic tasks can be scheduled on an m multiprocessor system. Performance comparisons of these protocols with MPCP shows that the proposed protocols increase schedulability. fl This work is supported in part by ARPA and Philips Labs under contract DASG-92-0055 to Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland.

Reference-contexts: Liu and Layland showed that Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduling is optimal among fixed priority scheduling algorithms, while Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling is optimal among dynamic priority scheduling algorithms <ref> [LL73] </ref>. They also derived processor utilization bounds for RM and EDF that are sufficient to guarantee that all jobs will complete within their periods. Job scheduling becomes more complex when jobs occasionally require exclusive access to shared resources. <p> Liu and Layland proved the schedulability condition for uniprocessor EDF scheduling <ref> [LL73] </ref>. A set of n periodic tasks can be scheduled by EDF algorithm if e 1 + w 2 e n 1: (1) If we find upper bounds for the blocking factors of MDPCP I, we can then derive sufficient schedu-lability conditions using equation 1. <p> A set of periodic tasks can be scheduled by RM if the following condition is satisfied <ref> [LL73] </ref>: n X e i n (2 n 1): (5) The metric used to compare the schedulability of these protocols is the maximum estimated consumed processor power (M ECP P ). Inequality 1 shows the intuition behind this measurement.

Reference-contexts: They also developed sufficient schedulability conditions for a set of periodic tasks to be scheduled via a PCP algorithm on a uniprocessor system.

MPCP does not allow nested accesses to global resources, i.e., it does not allow a task to simultaneously lock more than one global resource. <p> They then proved that the remote blocking time of a job blocked while attempting to enter a global critical section is a function of the access time of critical sections if and only if a job within the global critical section cannot be preempted by jobs executing outside critical sections <ref> [RSL88] </ref>. To ensure that blocking times are predictable, MDPCP I will not allow any job to preempt a job executing within a global critical section. Since local critical sections may not overlap or nest with global critical sections, we can use DPCP to synchronize access to local resources. <p> k m; w k;1 e k;2 + B k;2 + : : : + w k;n k 2 4 Multiprocessor Dynamic Priority Ceiling Protocol II (MD PCP II) The multiprocessor dynamic priority ceiling protocol II (MDPCP II) is based on a previously developed static priority multiprocessor protocol known as MPCP <ref> [RSL88] </ref>. To clearly distinguish our dynamic protocol MDPCP II from the static protocol MPCP, we will subsequently use the acronym MSPCP II to refer to the original MPCP protocol. MSPCP is short for multiprocessor static priority ceiling protocol.

Reference-contexts: Some amount of priority inversion is unavoidable to guarantee mutual exclusion; however, it must be bounded to allow schedulability analysis and minimized to improve utilization bounds. Sha et al. introduced the concept of priority inheritance protocols to solve the priority inversion problem <ref> [SRL87] </ref>. One of the more attractive protocols they propose, the priority ceiling protocol (PCP), prevents both deadlock and transitive blocking. They also developed sufficient schedulability conditions for a set of periodic tasks to be scheduled via a PCP algorithm on a uniprocessor system.
