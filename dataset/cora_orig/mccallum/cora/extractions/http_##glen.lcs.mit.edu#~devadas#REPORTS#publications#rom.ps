Abstract: Since the first papers on asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE), reduced order models have become standard for improving interconnect simulation efficiency, and very recent work has demonstrated that bi-orthogonalization algorithms can be used to robustly generate AWE-style macromodels. In this paper we describe using block Arnoldi-based orthogo-nalization methods to generate reduced order models from FastHenry, a multipole-accelerated three dimensional inductance extraction program. Examples are analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the block Arnoldi algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Recent work on reduced-order modeling techniques have made it possible to efficiently simulate circuits combined with interconnect <ref> [1] </ref>, but generating the reduced-order models from realistic 3-D structures has received less attention. Reduced-order models can be generated very efficiently by exploiting the fact that 3-D field solvers typically use Krylov-subspace based iterative methods.

Reference-contexts: Reduced-order models can be generated very efficiently by exploiting the fact that 3-D field solvers typically use Krylov-subspace based iterative methods. These iterative methods can provide more than just a solution at a particular frequency; they can be used to directly construct reduced-order models <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paper, we present a numerically robust and accurate approach for computing reduced-order models of magnetoquasistatic coupling in complicated 3-D structures. The approach is based on using the multipole-accelerated program FastHenry [3], combined with the block Krylov-subspace algorithm Arnoldi [4]. <p> u q1 s q1 + + u 1 s + u 0 (10) in the coefficients u i and w i such that [7] lim 1 d k q (s) = m k : (11) 3.2 Order Reduction using Arnoldi Iter ations As pointed out in [8] and applied in <ref> [2, 8, 9] </ref>, a numerically robust approach for computing G P q (s) of very high order is to use a Lanczos-based algorithm. An alternative approach, which robustly generates a somewhat different approximation, can be derived using an Arnoldi process as in the gmres algorithm used in FastHenry. <p> Based on the number of matrix-vector products, block Arnoldi is the most efficient at forming the reduced-order model. Also, since block Arnoldi has the fewest nonzeros, its system matrix would be the most efficient during circuit simulation. The authors would like to note that the researchers in <ref> [2] </ref> have developed an a block Lanczos algorithm which we understand will produce an A matrix with fewer nonzero entries. 4 (s), G A 56 (s).

The approach is based on using the multipole-accelerated program FastHenry <ref> [3] </ref>, combined with the block Krylov-subspace algorithm Arnoldi [4].

To describe the approach, consider that each conductor is approximated as piecewise-straight sections. The volume of each straight section is then discretized into a collection of parallel thin filaments through which current is assumed to flow uniformly.
