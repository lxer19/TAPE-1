Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory Technical Report 446 Also appears as MIT thesis for the degree of Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Supervised by Rosalind W. Picard Abstract Affective Computing is a newly emerging field which has been defined as "computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions." Many applications in affective computing research rely on, or can greatly benefit from, information regarding affective states of computer users. The sensing and recognition of human affect, therefore, is one of the most important research areas to receive much attention in the area of affective computing. In this work, inspired by the particular application of human-machine interaction and the potential use that human-computer interfaces can make of knowledge regarding the affective state of a user, we investigate the problem of sensing and recognizing typical affective experiences that arise in this setting. In particular, through the design of experimental conditions for data gathering, we approach the problem of detecting "frustration" in human computer interfaces. By first sensing human biophysiological correlates of internal affective states, we proceed to stochastically model the biological time series with Hidden Markov Models to obtain user-dependent recognition systems that learn affective patterns from a set of training data. Labeling criteria to classify the data are discussed, and generalization of the results to a set of unobserved data is evaluated. Final recognition results are reported under two conditions, for the entire data set, and only for those subjects with sufficient experimental data. Under the first criterion, recognition rates greater than random are obtained for 2 rates are reported for 7 8 of the subjects. This work was funded by IBM, BT, HP, and the MIT Media Lab TTT Consortium

Reference-contexts: The emergence of Affective Computing as a research field also follows this newly found interest in understanding the function of affect. Affective computing is "computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions" <ref> [1] </ref>. This work addresses one aspect of affective computing research, namely the recognition of human affect for applications arising naturally in a computer-human interaction. <p> The classical approach to wavelet construction involves finding the solution (x) to a two-scale equation: (x) = k Then, for the case of orthogonal wavelets with finite support (k 2 <ref> [0; 1; ; N 1] </ref> in B.2), the prototype wavelet may be obtained directly from (x) by [21] (x) = k This method of construction is based on a multiresolution analysis approach.

Reference-contexts: Another substantial contribution to emotion research has been provided by the recent work of the neuropsychologist Joseph LeDoux whose work has helped elucidate the neurological origins of emotions and their involvement in perception <ref> [3] </ref>. Much work has originated on how affect can be transmitted. Our approach to this work is based on principles of human psychophysiology, a subject with a rich history of research.

Historically, the sensing of human physiological responses to draw inferences about the internal state of an individual has spawned several applications including deception detection (polygraph) and alertness monitoring.
