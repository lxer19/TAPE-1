Abstract: for RSA based on the repertory grid. The algorithm incorporates user relevance judgments as a means to deal with the inherent problems associated with the specification of semantic attributes. The algorithm is implemented and tested on the human face image database and the initial results are encouraging. In essence, we have developed an overall methodology/test bed to facilitate experimentation with different algorithms for RSA. Image Retrieval (IR) problem is concerned with retrieving images that are relevant to users' requests from a large collection of images, referred to as the image database. A taxonomy for and the limitations of the existing approaches for image retrieval are discussed in [1]. Also, to alleviate some of the problems associated with these approaches, a unified framework for retrieval in image databases for a class of application areas is proposed in [1]. The framework provides a taxonomy for image attributes and identifies four generic types of retrieval based on the attribute taxonomy. Semantic attributes play a central role in supporting one of those generic retrieval types, referred to as Retrieval by Semantic Attributes (RSA). Semantic attributes are those attributes the specification of which necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision, and/or uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: These may include nose protrusion, area of the profile, distances between characteristic points, wiggliness of the profile, among others. Retrieval involving matching of Composite Drawings can be viewed as Retrieval by Semantic Attributes (RSA) <ref> [1] </ref>, since considerable subjectivity, imprecision, and uncertainty are associated with the attributes used in the retrieval. In Bann File searching, the person performing the retrieval has "live" access to the features of a face to be retrieved. <p> In this sense, Ranking for Photo Lineup can be considered as both Retrieval by Non-semantic Attributes (RNA) and RSA complementing each other. RNA and RSA are described in greater detail in <ref> [1] </ref>. In the next section, we describe the related work in the face recognition and retrieval area. In summary, a wide range of features have been used for face identification task. However, there is no general consensus as to what features are significant for discriminating face images. <p> The domain expert is asked to rate each of these images with respect to each of the semantic attributes identified in stage one. Gudivada, Raghavan, and Seetharaman More details on the PCT experimental methodology can be found in <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. The following section describes the elicitation of semantic attributes and the generation of repertory grid for the HF database. motivation for and a method for analyzing the repertory grid. 6. Repertory Grid Analysis Techniques 5. <p> During the second stage, the repertory grid is generated. A scale of 1-3 is used in rating the images. For space reasons, we have not included the repertory grid in this paper. It can be found in Appendix C in <ref> [1] </ref>. Next, we describe the An Approach to Interactive Retrieval in Face Image Databases Based on Semantic Attributes Three methods exist for analyzing the repertory grid: R norm measure [1, 6], Hart's measure [7], and Expected Mutual Information Measure (EMIM) [8, 9]. <p> It can be found in Appendix C in [1]. Next, we describe the An Approach to Interactive Retrieval in Face Image Databases Based on Semantic Attributes Three methods exist for analyzing the repertory grid: R norm measure <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, Hart's measure [7], and Expected Mutual Information Measure (EMIM) [8, 9]. The grid analysis involves first computing the similarity between each pair of attributes and then establishing dominant dependencies among the attributes. The methods differ in the way they compute the similarity between a pair of attributes. <p> It should be noted that the independence assumption among the semantic attributes is exploited in the calculation of RSV values. 8. Conclusions Retrieval by Semantic Attributes (RSA) is one of the four generic retrieval types in image database applications as identified in <ref> [1] </ref>. Methods for systematically deriving the semantic attributes and analyzing the Gudivada, Raghavan, and Seetharaman repertory grid for dependencies among these semantic attributes is an important aspect in the design of image database systems.

Reference-contexts: Also, we conclude that all the semantic attributes are independent. This observation is consistent with the related studies in Anthropology <ref> [11] </ref>. This independence among the attributes is P C q ( ) = = 1 3 and the expression for I evaluates to ln ( )3 and this value is equal to 1.10. Therefore, the maximum value of I is 1.10 and the minimum value is 0.0.

Reference-contexts: In most of the cases, matching algorithm is simply the Euclidean distance between the corresponding features. However, recent research indicates that features stored in terms of their deviations from the typical face are more useful for retrieval than the actual feature values themselves <ref> [16] </ref>. in the element and a value of three is assigned if the construct is certainly absent in the element. To indicate a subjective neutral position, a value of two is used. However, the granularity of the rating scale can vary.

Reference-contexts: Binarization of the repertory grid is explained next. Statistical techniques are used for exploiting user provided relevance information to assign weights to search terms to reflect their relative importance in the context of a user retrieval need in bibliographic retrieval systems <ref> [19] </ref>. The weight assigned to a search term is referred to as term relevance weight . Usually, user provided relevance information is in the form of preference relations (e.g., image 5 is preferred over image 2). It should be noted that these preferences can be multilevel.

Bollmann <ref> [20] </ref> provides a generalization of term relevance weight problem to multilevel preference relations. Under this generalization, term/attribute preference weight of an attribute a i , denoted ARW , is given by: 7. <p> The symbol &gt; denotes the relation "preferred over." Similar interpretation is given to the denominator. Also, it is shown in <ref> [20] </ref> that referred to as Attribute Relevance Weight (ARW) algorithm and the theoretical basis for the algorithm is presented next.
