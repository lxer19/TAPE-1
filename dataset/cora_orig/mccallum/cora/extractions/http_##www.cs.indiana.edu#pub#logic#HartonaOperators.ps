Reference-contexts: For example, in the presence of a new product operator ffi and/or implication operators 5 There is a similar-looking result in the literature, that we want to draw attention to, and distinguish from what we present here. Both Troelstra [35] (for the commutative case) and Abrusci <ref> [1] </ref> use the Dedekind-McNeile completion to obtain a completion in the case where both a tensor operation ffi and implications ; ! (or just !, in the commutative case) are present. <p> Also, a treatment of representable split negation (by means of implication operations, given a dualizing object 0) can be found in Abrusci <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, Abrusci assumes a temporal reading of the non-commutative tensor operation ffi and thereby of its residuals ; !. <p> We mention at this point that both Abrusci <ref> [1] </ref> and Troelstra [35] obtain representation theorems 11 only for the case where all operators ; ffi; ! are present (or just ffi; ! in the commutative case dealt with in Troelstra [35]).

Reference-contexts: What the reader wants to notice about Urquhart's theorem is that what allows for the representation of joins is that r and ` form a duality 3 between Im (u) and Im (ru). Subsequently, Allwein and Dunn <ref> [3] </ref> used Urquhart's representation theorem to provide a Kripke-style semantics for Linear Logic (without exponen-tials), or of subsystems of it. In Hartonas and Dunn [22], we proposed a simpler representation theorem for general lattices, abandoning filter-ideal pairs in favor of simply filters.

Reference-contexts: The full duality is reported in Allwein and Hartonas <ref> [4] </ref>, with an extension to a treatment of duality for the congruence lattice and the lattice of sublattices of a fixed lattice, concluding with a sheaf representation of general lattices.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, intersection of ideals is the adjoint completion of ^, and therefore it distributes over arbitrary joins of ideals, assuming the lattice to be distributive. Hence X is a complete Heyting algebra. 2 Remark 3.9 (Regular Completions) Consulting Gratzer [21], or Balbes and Dwinger <ref> [8] </ref>, or any standard textbook of lattice theory, the reader will find pointed out that the question whether every distributive lattice has a distributive completion must, in general, be answered in the negative! The apparent "contradiction" with our result is, however, only a matter of the meaning of words employed.

Reference-contexts: Given that negation is, algebraically, a galois connection, we generalize the previous observation with the following lemma, whose proof is straightforward and will be omitted. Similar sounding observations, we should point out, are made both in Birkhoff <ref> [9] </ref> and in Dunn [17], but not concluded with explicitly bringing to light this quite significant, for our representation purposes, lemma. <p> This is simply because R generates a galois 8 Chrysafis Hartonas connection on subsets of X, as pointed out by Birkhoff <ref> [9] </ref>, hence, by composition of the galois maps, a closure operator is induced. We could then rephrase our soundness and completeness theorem to refer to such relational frames.

Reference-contexts: The significance (for representation purposes) of the distribution properties of operators on lattices was first pointed out by Jonsson and Tarski in [25]. Also, essentially the same concept as in our definition of normal operators given above can be found in Dunn <ref> [15] </ref>, phrased in terms of distribution types assigned to operators. Definition 3.3 (Adjoint Completions) Let L = (L; ; ^; _; f ) be a lattice with a normal n-ary operator f and M a complete lattice. <p> We then require that, for any subset U X, the following axiom should hold: (U ) - (U -) 14 Hence ( ) has a right adjoint. Dunn <ref> [15] </ref> also points this out, calling the right residual backwards necessity, denoted as 2 # . We will not have any use of this residual in this paper. 48 Chrysafis Hartonas Proposition 4.4 then gives us a way of obtaining an operation on -stable sets, distributing over arbitrary joins.

Reference-contexts: Dunn <ref> [16] </ref> reports similar results, comparing relational and operational representations of negation. Interestingly, in the framework investigated in [16], intuitionistic negation does not seem to lend itself to an operational treatment.

Interestingly, in the framework investigated in [16], intuitionistic negation does not seem to lend itself to an operational treatment. Proposition 4.35 If the negation operator : satisfies double negation (::a = a), then so does star. Consequently, in that case, the star operator ( ) fl satisfies the infinite De Morgan laws. <p> A first intuition in this direction can be also found in Dunn <ref> [16] </ref>, where the author considers a pair of subminimal negations that form a galois connection (which is what we call a minimal split negation, in 44 Chrysafis Hartonas [22]).

Reference-contexts: Given that negation is, algebraically, a galois connection, we generalize the previous observation with the following lemma, whose proof is straightforward and will be omitted. Similar sounding observations, we should point out, are made both in Birkhoff [9] and in Dunn <ref> [17] </ref>, but not concluded with explicitly bringing to light this quite significant, for our representation purposes, lemma. <p> In accordance with our discussion on representing operations by relations, what we need is a 3-ary relation R X 3 to interpret each of the operators. From our previous discussion (and as noted in Dunn <ref> [17] </ref>) we have that Lemma 4.10 The relation R X 3 of a frame (X; R) induces the following operations on subsets of X: V U = fx 2 Xj8y; z 2 X ( if Rxyz and y 2 U; then z 2 V )g U R V = fz 2 <p> and ? V x = V x fl . 2 12 We work here directly on filters, rather than constructing a split negation first on the ideal space. 46 Chrysafis Hartonas Remark 4.41 (Relational Representation) For the relational representation of the split negation we may define ? as in Dunn <ref> [17] </ref>, by x ? y iff 9a 2 x :a 2 y. We note that since ~ :a = a = : ~ a, the condition 9a 2 x; ~ a 2 y corresponds to the converse of ?, so that we do not really need two relations.

Reference-contexts: With exchange in place, ffi is commutative and it has been Girard's <ref> [18] </ref> proposal that ffi can be understood as capturing the intuition of events being realized concurrently. Dropping exchange as well, ffi is no longer commutative and is more like the conjunction operation "and then" of quantum logic. <p> above are sound and complete with respect to closure frames with a ternary relation as in definition 4.11. 2 4.7 Intuitionistic and Classical Linear Logic 4.7.1 The Systems ILL and ILZ For a complete sequent and axiomatic presentation of Linear Logic we refer the reader to either Girard's original paper <ref> [18] </ref>, or Avron's [7], or Troelstra's [35].

Reference-contexts: Proposition 2.1 With the topology induced by the subbasis S, the filter space of the lattice is a Stone space. For the proof, we refer the reader to Goldblatt <ref> [20] </ref>. 2 In the presence of an orthonegation, the set-theoretic representation of joins reduces to such of meets, as Goldblatt [20] has shown, since joins can be defined in terms of meets by the De Morgan property of orthonegation, as a _ b = :(:a ^ :b). <p> Proposition 2.1 With the topology induced by the subbasis S, the filter space of the lattice is a Stone space.

A first intuition in this direction can be also found in Dunn [16], where the author considers a pair of subminimal negations that form a galois connection (which is what we call a minimal split negation, in 44 Chrysafis Hartonas [22]). <p> negation we refer the reader to Har-tonas and Dunn <ref> [22] </ref>.

Also, a treatment of representable split negation (by means of implication operations, given a dualizing object 0) can be found in Abrusci [1]. In this paper, Abrusci assumes a temporal reading of the non-commutative tensor operation ffi and thereby of its residuals ; !. <p> Assuming a dualizing object 0 and representability of split negation via implication, however, is a technical convenience but in no way a necessity for a treatment of split negation. As an example, we give below a treatment of what we called in <ref> [22] </ref> a De Morgan Split Negation. Needless to say, other varieties of split negation can be treated in much the same way, in the spirit of our previous results.

Reference-contexts: These issues are taken up in detail in Hartonas <ref> [23] </ref>, but would constitute an unwelcome digression from the main theme of the present paper. Lattices with Additional Operators 7 2.1 Lattice Logic We have minor interest in lattice logic per se, however some remarks at this point, with no additional operators present to complicate the picture, will be useful. <p> We will also ommit the relevant soundness and completeness theorems. A full treatment, however, is to be found in Hartonas <ref> [23] </ref>, including a detailed discussion of Kripke frames for modal logics on a sentential calculus that does not even have the distribution law. The operator 3 is a normal operator 3 : L ! L, distributing over finite joins. <p> By theorem 3.5, we obtain an adjoint completion 3 fl : I (L) ! I (L), 13 A detailed treatment of the varieties of split negation, with presentation of the syntax of the logical calculi involved and soundness and completeness proofs, can be found in Hartonas <ref> [23] </ref>. The question of relational representation is also presented there in more detail. Lattices with Additional Operators 47 defined on an ideal y by 3 fl y = W fy a jy a yg. <p> Some work needs to be done in characterizing the appropriate Kripke frames, which is more or less in the spirit of the work presented here for other operators. The reader who is interested to see all details worked out, on the above issues, might want to consult Hartonas <ref> [23] </ref>. We hope that we have presented enough material so that the concept of our approach should be clear. 15 Girard calls it par and uses a different notation, but + (plus) has become more of a standard usage for this connective.

Reference-contexts: a number of inspiring conversations. 1 Among which, the best known systems are Linear and Relevance Logic, BCC and BCK Logic and the Lambek Calculus. 1 2 Chrysafis Hartonas From an algebraic standpoint, the representation problems discussed here can be seen as extending the classical work of Jonsson and Tarski <ref> [25] </ref>. On a more recent footing, we extend work in this area by J. Michael Dunn [15,17], and contribute to the development of his gaggle theory. <p> Normality (join-normality) can now be seen for !, since it preserves (in this presentation) joins in each argument place, taking them to joins in L op . The significance (for representation purposes) of the distribution properties of operators on lattices was first pointed out by Jonsson and Tarski in <ref> [25] </ref>.

Lattices with Additional Operators 19 4.1.1 Residuals and Relations For simplicity, we only attend here to unary operations, the generalization to operations of greater arity being more or less immediate.

In the case of arbitrary lattices, however, one invariably stumbles over the representation of joins.
