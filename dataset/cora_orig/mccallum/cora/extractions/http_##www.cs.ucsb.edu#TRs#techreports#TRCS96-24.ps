Abstract: We consider Multimessage Multicasting over the n processor complete (or fully connected) static network (MM C ) with Forwarding. We present an efficient algorithm that constructs for every degree d problem instance a communication schedule with total communication time at most 2d, where d is the maximum number of messages that each processor may send (receive). Our algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase a set of communications are scheduled to be carried out in d time periods in such a way that the resulting problem is a multimessage unicasting problem of degree d. In the second phase we generate a communication schedule for this problem by reducing it to the Makespan Openshop Preemptive Scheduling problem which can be solved in polynomial time. The final schedule is the concatenation of the communication schedules for these two phases. Our centralized algorithms require all the communication information ahead of time. Applications where all of this information is readily available include iterative algorithms for solving linear equations, and most dynamic programming procedures. The Meiko CS-2 machine and in general computer systems with processors communicating via dynamic permutation networks whose basic switches can act as data replicators (e.g., n by n Benes network with 2 by 2 switches that can also act as data replicators) will also benefit from our results since the same schedules can be used in these systems. Keywords: Approximation Algorithms, Multimessage Multicasting, Dynamic Net works, Parallel Iterative Methods, Communication Schedules, Forwarding.

Reference-contexts: The first phase replicates data and transmits it to other processors, and the second phase distributes data to the appropriate processors ([16], [17], [20]). The IBM GF11 machine <ref> [1] </ref>, and the Meiko CS-2 machine use Benes networks for processor interconnection. The two stage translation process can also be used in the Meiko CS-2 computer system, and any multimessage multicasting schedule can be realized by using basic synchronization primitives.

Reference-contexts: It is not surprising that several authors have studied the M U C problem as well as several interesting variations for which NP-completeness has been established, subproblems have been shown to be polynomially solvable, and approximation algorithms and heuristics have been developed. Coffman, Garey, Johnson and LaPaugh <ref> [2] </ref> studied a version the multimessage unicasting problem when messages have different lengths, each processor can send (receive) ff (P i ) 1 (fi (P i ) 1) messages simultaneously, and messages are transmitted without interruption (non-preemptive mode). Whitehead [22] considered the case when messages can be sent indirectly.

Reference-contexts: The M M C problem is significantly harder than the M U C . Gonzalez [8] showed that even when k = 2 the decision version of the M M C problem is NP-complete. Gonzalez <ref> [6] </ref> developed an efficient algorithm to construct for any degree d problem instance a communication schedule with total communication time at most d 2 , and presented problem instances for which this upper bound on the communication time is best possible, i.e. the upper bound is also a lower bound. <p> The lower bound holds when there is a huge number of processors and the fan-out is also huge. Since this situation is not likely to arise in the near future Gonzalez <ref> [6] </ref> and [7] considered the M M C problem with restricted fan-out.

These problem instances are the ones that arise in practice, since the fan-out restriction is imposed by the applications and the number of processors available in commercial systems. <p> Proof: The proof follows from the above discussion. 2 4 Discussion The approximation algorithm in this paper generates a communication schedule with total communication time at most 2d. This is significantly better than the one of previous algorithms ([6], <ref> [7] </ref>). However those algorithms are faster and were designed for the case when forwarding was not allowed. The approach we have taken in this paper can be shown to require in the worst case 2d communication steps.

Reference-contexts: For example technical reports may be sent indirectly, but it may be unacceptable to transmit credit card numbers, or other sensitive information indirectly when a direct link exists. Our introduction is a condensed version of the one in <ref> [8] </ref>, which includes a complete justification for the multimessage multicasting problem as well as motivations, applications and examples. Routing in the complete static network (there are bidirectional links between every pair of processors) is the simplest and most flexible when compared to other static and dynamic networks. <p> When the processors are connected via a pr-dynamic network a communication mode can be performed in two stages: the data replication step followed by the data distribution step ([16], 5 [20], [17]). This two stage process can be used in the MEIKO CS-2 machine <ref> [8] </ref>. An important subproblem of the basic multicasting problem is when every message it to be sent to adjacent numbered processors. In this case this basic multicast operation can be performed in one step in pr-dynamic networks, and in the MEIKO CS-2 machine.

In this case this basic multicast operation can be performed in one step in pr-dynamic networks, and in the MEIKO CS-2 machine. Gonzalez [8] also considered the case when each message has fixed fan-out k (maximum number of processors that may receive a given message). <p> The M M C problem involves multicasting of any number of messages, and its communication model is similar in nature to the one in the Meiko CS2 machine, after solving some basic synchronization problems.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm is similar to a subalgorithm for an approximation algorithm for the MultiVia Assignment problem given by Gonzalez in <ref> [10] </ref>. The idea is to select an origin for each message in such a way that the resulting problem instance has least degree. <p> The set of dotted edges is an optimal complete s-matching with M (I) = 2. It is simple to show that in this case there is more than one optimal complete s-matching. A polynomial time algorithm for finding an optimal complete s-matching is given by Gonzalez <ref> [10] </ref>. The algorithm finds a maximum matching in a set of bipartite graphs. The time complexity is O (es 1:5 t 0:5 log s), where e is the number of edges, s = jSj, and t = jT j.

Reference-contexts: Solve the openshop 8 problem R by using Gonzalez and Sahni's algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> and construct from it a com-munication schedule (X 0 ) for problem instance ( ^ I; ^ G) with total communication time equal to ^ d. 4. Constructing Final Communication Schedule: Concatenate the communication schedules X and X 0 , and eliminate all dummy processors and dummy messages. <p> This problem can be solved by the polynomial time algorithm given in <ref> [11] </ref>. An openshop consists of m 1 machines, and n 1 jobs. Each job consists of m tasks. The j th task of job i (T i;j ) must be executed by the j th machine for t i;j 0 time units. <p> Let m i be the total time that machine i must be busy, and t j be the total time that job j needs to be executed. Let t = maxfm i ; t j g. Gonzalez and Sahni <ref> [11] </ref> have shown that there is always a preemptive schedule with finish time t, which is the best possible, and that one such schedule can be constructed in O (r (minfr; m 2 g + m log n)) time, where r is the number of nonzero tasks. <p> Furthermore, when all of the t i;j s are integers, there is a schedule where preemptions occur only at integer points, and one such schedule is generated by Gonzalez and Sahni's <ref> [11] </ref> algorithm. The M U C problem of degree ^ d is a special case of the preemptive openshop problem with every t i;j 2 f0; 1; : : : ; ^ dg. Each of the ^n vertices in the communication graph represents a job, and a machine. <p> Furthermore, one can easily adapt the algorithm for the minimum finish time openshop problem given in <ref> [11] </ref> to construct one such communication schedule. The time complexity is O (r (minfr; m 2 g + m log ^n)) time, where r ^ d^n, and m = ^n. <p> The procedure takes O (r (minfr; m 2 g + m log ^n)) time, where r ^ d^n, and m = ^n. Proof: By the above discussion. 2 2.0.4 Constructing Final Communication Schedule: Solve the openshop problem R by using Gonzalez and Sahni's algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> and construct from it a communication schedule (X 0 ) for problem instance ^ I of the M U C problem with total communication time equal to ^ d, as pointed out in the previous subsection.

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished by translating each communication phase for the complete network into no more than two communication phases for pr-dynamic networks. The first phase replicates data and transmits it to other processors, and the second phase distributes data to the appropriate processors ([16], <ref> [17] </ref>, [20]). The IBM GF11 machine [1], and the Meiko CS-2 machine use Benes networks for processor interconnection. The two stage translation process can also be used in the Meiko CS-2 computer system, and any multimessage multicasting schedule can be realized by using basic synchronization primitives. <p> The two stage translation process can also be used in the Meiko CS-2 computer system, and any multimessage multicasting schedule can be realized by using basic synchronization primitives. This two step translation process can be reduced to one step by increasing the number of network switches about 50% ([16], <ref> [17] </ref>, and [20]). In what follows we concentrate on the M M C problem because it has a simple structure, and, as mentioned above, results for this network can be easily translated to other dynamic networks. Let us formally define our problem. <p> The communication schedule has only one communication mode. When the processors are connected via a pr-dynamic network a communication mode can be performed in two stages: the data replication step followed by the data distribution step ([16], 5 [20], <ref> [17] </ref>).

Since hypercubes are static networks, there is no direct comparison to our work.
