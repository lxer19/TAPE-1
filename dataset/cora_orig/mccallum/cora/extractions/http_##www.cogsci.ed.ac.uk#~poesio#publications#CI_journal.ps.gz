Title: Conversational Actions and Discourse Situations  
Author: Massimo Poesio David R. Traum TECFA, FPSE 
Affiliation: University of Edinburgh Centre for Cognitive Science and HCRC  Universite de Geneve  
Abstract: We use the idea that actions performed in a conversation become part of the common ground as the basis for a model of context that reconciles in a general and systematic fashion the differences between the theories of discourse context used for reference resolution, intention recognition, and dialogue management. We start from the treatment of anaphoric accessibility developed in DRT, and we show first how to obtain a discourse model that, while preserving DRT's basic ideas about referential accessibility, includes information about the occurrence of speech acts and their relations. Next, we show how the different kinds of `structure' that play a role in conversation discourse segmentation, turn-taking, and groundingcan be formulated in terms of information about speech acts, and use this same information as the basis for a model of the interpretation of fragmentary input.

Reference-contexts: Our proposal is motivated by work on the TRAINS project at the University of Rochester, one of whose aims is the development of a planning assistant able to engage with its user in spoken conversations in the domain of transportation by train <ref> [ Allen et al., 1995 ] </ref> . The TRAINS prototype must perform several kinds of linguistic activities that depend on a context, including reference resolution, intention recognition and dialogue management. <p> Illocutionary act recognition algorithms based on those discussed in [ Allen and Perrault, 1980; Hinkelman, 1990; Traum and Hinkelman, 1992 ] have been developed in the TRAINS System <ref> [ Allen et al., 1995 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: underspecification just proposed and the alternatives is that by making underspecified representations partial characterizations of the discourse situations we can express them within the logics already introduced for semantic processing (e.g., Muskens' logic TT 4 2 ), instead of introducing new logics with a special semantics as done, e.g., in <ref> [ Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Reyle, 1993; Poesio, 1995b ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: do not, however, interpret their underspecified representations as partial characterizations of the discourse situation, but as expressions of a different `glue language'. 32 5.3 Interpretation The theory of locutionary acts just sketched gives us the opportunity to characterize all interpretation processes as a form of defeasible reasoning over underspecified representations <ref> [ Hobbs et al., 1993; Alshawi, 1992 ] </ref> . As space prevents an extensive discussion of our work on interpretation, we will just give here a few illustrative examples.

Reference-contexts: This dependence on speech acts is the main difference between our model and the STDRT model of context developed by Asher, Lascarides, Oberlander and others more or less in parallel with our work on TRAINS (see, e.g., <ref> [ Lascarides and Asher, 1991; Asher, 1993 ] </ref> ). One reason for the difference is that Asher et al. are concerned with texts rather than conversations. 9 Utterance Units roughly correspond to intonation phrases, although long pauses are also taken as unit boundaries.

Reference-contexts: One example of poor fit between existing theories of context is the contrast between, on the one hand, linguistically motivated theories of context developed to account for the semantics of anaphora (e.g., <ref> [ Kamp and Reyle, 1993 ] </ref> ); and on the other hand, the models of context proposed for intention recognition and dialogue management, whose emphasis is on capturing the effects of speech acts on the beliefs, intentions, and obligations of the participating agents [ Allen, 1983; Carberry, 1990; Cohen and Levesque, <p> Section 2 is a brief introduction to Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), a theory of context developed in formal semantics that embodies the traditional basics of the reference resolution tra 1 See, e.g., <ref> [ Kamp and Reyle, 1993 ] </ref> for the details of a semantic treatment of anaphoric reference, and the papers in [ Cohen et al., 1990 ] for theories about the effect of speech acts on the mental state of agents. 2 dition; we take a version of this theory as starting <p> Modeling update is the raison d'etre of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) <ref> [ Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993 ] </ref> and related `dynamic' theories [ Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991 ] .

Reference-contexts: This section is somewhat technical, and may be skipped by those readers who are willing to accept our claim that sentences of English can be mapped into DRT expressions by means of techniques for semantic composition analogous to those used in theories of semantic interpretation such as Montague Grammar <ref> [ Montague, 1973 ] </ref> . This is done in Muskens' theory by interpreting DRT expressions as expressions of a typed logic; the mapping also gives us a proof theory for our language. <p> He arrives at a compositional formulation of the DRS construction algorithm by interpreting DRSs and conditions as expressions of a special form of type theory that includes, in addition to the two primitive types of Montague's Intensional Logic <ref> [ Montague, 1973 ] </ref> e (`entities') and t (`truth values'), two new primitive types: the type s of states, and the type of discourse referents. Muskens proposes to use constants of type as the interpretation of noun phrases.

Reference-contexts: in Section 5 how we assume this information about the discourse situation is used for interpretation, there is no space for an extensive discussion, and to talk about other modules of our system that rely on this information, such as the Dialogue Manager; these topics are discussed at length in <ref> [ Poesio, 1994; Traum, 1994 ] </ref> and more briefly in [ Allen et al., 1995; Traum et al., to appear 1996 ] . Most of our discussion below is based on transcripts of spoken conversations collected as part of the TRAINS project [ Gross et al., 1993 ] . <p> The ontological status of subplans is rather unclear, however (for discussion, see <ref> [ Poesio, 1994; Traum et al., to appear 1996 ] </ref> ). <p> But, as discussed in the previous section, different speech acts may be about different described situations, which is a problem for this solution. Our solution to the problem is based on ideas proposed in <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> . The theory proposed there is based on the treatment of tense, aspect and event anaphora originated by Davidson [ 1967 ] and adopted with some variations in DRT and other semantic theories such as Episodic Logic [ Hwang, 1992; Hwang and Schubert, 1993 ] . <p> B: is THAT a suggestion? This observation led to the first ingredient of the proposal in <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> , namely, the hypothesis that the events that take place in the discourse situation leave a `trace' in the form of discourse referents just as the events that take place in a described situation do. <p> The second ingredient of that theory is a theory of update in which it is entire situations that get updated, rather than just assignments, and the dynamic properties of utterances are characterized in terms of (changes to) described situations. In <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> , utterances are transitions from discourse situations to discourse situations, such that the discourse situation resulting from an utterance includes additional conversational events. <p> we can define a new type of condition, written 's : '', and stating that situation s is of type '; this construct is analogous to constructs used in theo 16 A dynamics of situations is needed for more complex cases of anaphora, including so-called `bridging' references and `result-state' anaphora <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> . For example, the action of mixing water with flour originates a situation which includes an additional object that may serve as antecedent for definite descriptions such as the dough even though it hasn't been explicitly mentioned. <p> A similar claim that a situational view on dynamics offers a more general theory of anaphoric phenomena is in [ Milward, 1995 ] . 17 The theory in <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> was based on Episodic Logic, a version of Situation Theory with many points in common with Muskens' proposal, but much richer in many respects [ Hwang, 1992; Hwang and Schubert, 1993 ] . <p> Whenever the input is only partially grammatical, however, it is necessary to have a way to codify the interaction between a traditional parser and `robust' parsing techniques, so that this can be made accessible to explicit repair; this can be done in terms of micro conversational events. 33 See <ref> [ Poesio, 1994; Poesio, 1993 ] </ref> for details about definite description interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we could treat all cases of pronominal reference in a dialogue as instances of MODAL SUBORDINATION <ref> [ Roberts, 1989 ] </ref> .

Our solution to the problem is based on ideas proposed in [ Poesio, 1994 ] .

It should be noted, however, that even the model proposed by Grosz and Sidner is not a stack in a strict sense.

Reference-contexts: Initiator proposes a new item as part of a plan. request Like a suggest, but also imposes a discourse obligation to respond. accept Initiator agrees to a proposal by responder. reject Initiator rejects a proposal by responder. 13 We posit a series of low-level acts to model the turn-taking process <ref> [ Sacks et al., 1974; Orestrom, 1983 ] </ref> . The basic acts are keep-turn, release-turn, assign-turn and take-turn.

Reference-contexts: We think this is perhaps the major formal challenge for a theory of the type we are developing. A second issue is how to formalize repair processes <ref> [ Schegloff et al., 1977; Levelt, 1983 ] </ref> . Whereas all speech acts that we have discussed augment the common ground, repairs seem to crucially involve a `revision' stepi.e., some information seems to disappear. Thus, an account of repair processing seems to involve `down-date' operations.

Reference-contexts: Some of the core speech acts used in TRAINS-93 are characterized as follows: inform Initiator presents responder with new information in an attempt to add a new mutual belief. ynq Initiator asks responder to provide information that initiator is missing but suspects that responder may know; imposes a discourse obligation <ref> [ Traum and Allen, 1994 ] </ref> on responder to evaluate and respond to the request. check Like a ynq, but initiator already suspects the answer; initiator wants to move the proposition in question from individual to mutual belief, or bring the be lief into working memory. eval An evaluation by the <p> Information about the (mutually known) intentions, beliefs, perceptual input, and obligations <ref> [ Traum and Allen, 1994 ] </ref> of the conversants is also part of the discourse situation.

Reference-contexts: One reason for the difference is that Asher et al. are concerned with texts rather than conversations. 9 Utterance Units roughly correspond to intonation phrases, although long pauses are also taken as unit boundaries.
