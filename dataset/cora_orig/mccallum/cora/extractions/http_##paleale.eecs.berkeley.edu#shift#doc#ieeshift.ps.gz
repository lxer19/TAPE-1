Abstract: Shift is a programming language for describing dynamic networks of hybrid automata. Such systems consist of components which can be created, interconnected and destroyed as the system evolves. Components exhibit hybrid behavior, consisting of continuous-time phases separated by discrete-event transitions. Components may evolve independently, or they may interact through their inputs, outputs and exported events. The interaction network itself may evolve. We believe that the Shift model offers the proper level of abstraction for describing complex applications such as automated highway systems, air traffic control systems, robotic shopfloors, coordinated submarines and other systems whose operation cannot be captured easily by conventional models. We have implemented a compiler for translating a Shift program to a C program, and we have implemented the Shift run-time system for obtaining an executable program. The executable program, when run, simulates the design specified in the Shift source program.

Reference-contexts: The hybrid systems approach <ref> [1] </ref> satisfied our needs for component modeling but not for modeling dynamically reconfigurable interactions between components. Most general-purpose programming languages support dynamic reconfigurability. But the abstraction facilities in general-purpose programming languages such as C or C++ would not allow us to write simple, concise descriptions of our designs.

Shift provides two native data types|number and symbol, and it provides mechanisms for defining additional types. Variables of type number have piecewise constant or piecewise continuous real-valued time traces. The latter variables are declared to be of type continuous number.
