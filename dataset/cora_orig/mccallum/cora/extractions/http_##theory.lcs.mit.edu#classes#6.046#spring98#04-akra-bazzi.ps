Abstract: Techniques for solving divide-and-conquer recurrences are routinely taught to thousands of Computer Science students each year. The dominant approach to solving such recurrences is known as the Master Method [2]. Recently, Akra and Bazzi [1] discovered a surprisingly elegant generalization of the Master Method that yields a very simple formula for solving most divide- and-conquer recurrences. In these notes, we provide a simple inductive proof of the Akra-Bazzi result and we extend the result to handle variations of divide-and-conquer recurrences that commonly arise in practice.

Reference-contexts: The Master Method is fairly powerful and results in a closed form solution for divide-and-conquer recurrences with a special (but commonly-occurring) form. Recently Akra and Bazzi <ref> [1] </ref> discovered a far more general solution to divide-and-conquer recurrences. <p> 1 2 T (x=2) + fi (1=x), then p = 1 and T (x) = fi ((log x)=x). * If T (x) = 4T (x=2) + fi (x), then p = 2 and T (x) = fi (x 2 ). 1 These conditions are somewhat less restrictive than those of <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 The proof of Theorem 1 makes use of the following simple lemma from calculus. Lemma 1. <p> We will use induction to prove Theorem 1, and so it will be helpful to partition the domain of x into intervals I 0 = <ref> [1; x 0 ] </ref> and I j = (x 0 + j 1; x 0 + j] for j 1. <p> As a consequence, we know that the value of T in any interval after <ref> [1; x 0 ] </ref> depends only on the values of T in prior intervals. 3 Proof of Theorem 1. <p> The base case when j = 0 follows from the fact that T (x) = fi (1) when x 2 <ref> [1; x 0 ] </ref> (provided that we choose c 5 small enough). <p> For example, in algorithm design, recurrences of the form T (x) i=1 are common. Generally speaking, the inclusion of floors and ceilings in a recurrence does not significantly change the nature of the solution (e.g., see <ref> [1, 2] </ref>), but the proofs of this fact tend to be fairly tedious and specialized in nature. <p> The base case when j = 0 follows from the fact that T (x) = fi (1) when x 2 <ref> [1; x 0 ] </ref> (provided that c 5 is chosen to be a small enough constant). 6 The inductive step is argued as follows: T (x) = i=1 i=1 1 !

Reference-contexts: Many methods are known for solving recurrences such as T (n) = 1 if n = 1 but perhaps the most widely taught approach is the Master Method that is described in the seminal algorithms text by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest <ref> [2] </ref>. The Master Method is fairly powerful and results in a closed form solution for divide-and-conquer recurrences with a special (but commonly-occurring) form. Recently Akra and Bazzi [1] discovered a far more general solution to divide-and-conquer recurrences. <p> For example, in algorithm design, recurrences of the form T (x) i=1 are common. Generally speaking, the inclusion of floors and ceilings in a recurrence does not significantly change the nature of the solution (e.g., see <ref> [1, 2] </ref>), but the proofs of this fact tend to be fairly tedious and specialized in nature.
