Reference-contexts: actual or expected flows or counts of traffic between all possible pairs of origin ("O") and destination ("D") nodes or zones in urban road networks during a specific time interval These matrices are used as inputs to network equilibrium models that are central tools in transportation modelling and policy studies <ref> (Berka and Boyce 1994, Sheffi 1995, West 1994) </ref>. Our work directly connects with specific road transportation network problems, and we develop an applied study in the area in Section 4 below. The current article addresses the network count inference problem from a Bayesian perspective. <p> In developing prior estimates of origin-destination matrices in connection with network equilibrium models, for example <ref> (Berka and Boyce 1994, Sheffi 1995) </ref> conditional Poisson models are typical although dependencies between flows are often strong and may be modelled through hierarchical models for the rates fl (e.g. Sen 1987, West 1994). <p> archetype context is one of updating estimates of OD flows: based on "today's" initial OD flow estimates and link traffic since observed, make forecasts of "tomorrow's" OD flows to feed into traffic management and decision systems, including network equilibrium models that are central tools in transportation modelling and policy studies <ref> (Berka and Boyce 1994, Sheffi 1995, Smith 1987, West 1994) </ref>. This problem has an inherent Bayesian flavour and, though most approaches have been quite ad-hoc, some have adopted basic Bayesian methods (Maher 1983).

Reference-contexts: The above assurances on convergence of the MCMC algorithms are complemented by positive results from various standard convergence investigations as implemented in CODA <ref> (Best et al 1995) </ref>. Following this, we summarise analysis by running the MCMC algorithm for a total 50,000 iterations and computing posterior estimates based on only 5,000 values.

Reference-contexts: If p ( a ) is gamma, or a mixture of gammas, these draws are trivially made from the corresponding gamma or mixture of gamma posteriors. Otherwise, we may use a rejection method or embed Metropolis-Hasting steps in the MCMC scheme in the by now standard "Metropolis-within-Gibbs" framework <ref> (e.g. see the many examples in Gilks et al 1996) </ref>. Now turn to the conditional posterior p (Xjfl; Y); viewing fl as fixed.

Reference-contexts: More often, especially in larger networks, we need an algorithm to appropriately reorder routes and deduce the resulting routing matrix in the form (3) automatically. This may be done as follows. Recall the QR decomposition of arbitrary, full-rank, matrices <ref> (e.g. Golub and Van Loan 1983, Section 6.2) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This problem has an inherent Bayesian flavour and, though most approaches have been quite ad-hoc, some have adopted basic Bayesian methods <ref> (Maher 1983) </ref>. One interest here is to assess the efficacy of the full Bayesian solution in the context assumed above on a real network.

Reference-contexts: This argues against the use of uniform priors and suggests that the standard practice in transportation studies, i.e., that of updating initial or prior estimates of OD flows based on previous data and experience <ref> (McNeil and Hendrickson 1985, Maher 1983) </ref>, is partly helping to constrain the problem to overcome these kinds of identification difficulties. <p> We demonstrate how this may be remedied through the use of informed prior distributions that provide appropriate "constraints" and note that this strategy is perfectly consistent with current practices in "updating" OD flow estimates in transportation networks <ref> (McNeil and Hendrickson 1985, Maher 1983) </ref>. Other existing algorithms, including that of Vardi, run the unavoidable risk of over-estimating low flows on OD routes that share links with OD routes experiencing high flows.

Reference-contexts: This approach represents a standard application of "Metropolis-within-Gibbs" and, subject to verification of irreducibility of the resulting Markov chain on the space inhabited by (X; fl); leads to an overall simulation scheme that will ultimately generate samples from the required joint posterior <ref> (Tierney 1994) </ref>. We have experimented with various such approaches, concentrating on efficient independence chain methods.

Reference-contexts: This network is structured so that all OD pairs have just one route between them, so falls under the fixed routing assumptions of our model. The network is schematically represented in Figure 6. This network has been adapted into the operating "real-time" simulation system Integration <ref> (Van Aerde et al 1996) </ref>; this system is extensively used in studying effects on traffic networks of potential network and road traffic policy changes.
