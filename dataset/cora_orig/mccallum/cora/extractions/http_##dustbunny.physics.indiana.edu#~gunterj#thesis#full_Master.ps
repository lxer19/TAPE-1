Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 Hadrons within the Standard Model The observed spectra and interactions of hadrons and leptons can be explained by the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics <ref> [1] </ref>. Within the context of the Standard Model, hadronic states are described in terms of combinations of fundamental spin-1/2 fermions called quarks and spin-1 bosons called gluons. Interactions of quarks and gluons are described by a theory called quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD). Six "flavors" of quark have been identified.

Reference-contexts: Photons are electrically neutral and do not interact with other pho tons; gluons are color charged and do interact with other gluons. The three light quarks may be thought of as elements of an SU (3) f sym metry group <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A convenient compilation of non-qq candidates may be found in the "Non-qq Candidates" mini-review in 7 <ref> [4] </ref>. Non-qq mesons are classified in terms of quark and gluon content and are referred as glueballs, hybrids and multi-quark states. 1.1.2.1 Glueballs Within the framework of QCD, gluons, which carry color charge, can form bound states. That is, gluons can form quarkless mesons. Such states are called glueballs. <p> The Particle Data Group (PDG) <ref> [4] </ref> lists four or five f 0 states below 2.0 GeV=c 2 in the 1996 data tables; a very broad f 0 (400 1200), a narrow 15 f 0 (980), a broad f 0 (1370), an f 0 (1500), an f J (1710) which may be spin zero, spin two or <p> The f 4 (2050) has been observed decaying into !!, , , and KK <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Much theoretical work has gone into predicting glue-ball masses and decay widths of the lowest mass scalar glueball using lattice QCD <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Lattice QCD calculations as well as other theoretical estimates [7] place the scalar glueball between 1.5 and 2.0 GeV=c 2 . Since glueball states have no quark content they must be flavorless (I = 0; S = 0 etc.).

Below KK threshold, the only open decay channels are into two and four pions. Because the f 0 (980) couples strongly to KK the lineshape must be distorted with the opening of the KK exit channel causing a cusp-like effect.

Reference-contexts: The signature for CP violation then would be the observation of KK in a CP even state. The radiative decays ! flK 0 K 0 and fl where the re-scatters into a pair of kaons may, however, lead to a background source of kaons in a CP odd state <ref> [15] </ref>. The phase space for the radiative decay is limited and if the is produced at rest, the photon will have low energy. If the radiated photon is lost, the observation of kaons in a CP odd state may be falsely interpreted as evidence for CP violation.

If the scattering is due to a attractive (repulsive) force the phase shift will be positive (negative).

According to Monte Carlo studies <ref> [56] </ref>, a recoiling neutron will interact in the CID approximately 15% of the time, falsely vetoing p ! 0 0 n events. Furthermore, events may be falsely vetoed due to "pile-up" in the CID when signal from previous beam particles (including the beam halo) is registered. <p> From Monte Carlo studies of the CID, recoil neutrons give measurable signals in the detector only 15% of the time <ref> [56] </ref>. The energy spectrum is therefore expected to peak at zero for real p ! 0 0 n events as is observed. The structure of the spectrum near zero is an artifact of the analysis.

Further detail on the motor drive system, the interlocks, and the rotational position transducers is given in Reference <ref> [61] </ref>. The transporter was fabricated, assembled, and mounted on the rail system in the high bay area of the Indiana University Physics Department. Safety tests of the transporter were conducted there by exercising the full range of motion of the transporter under load. <p> The light output varied by a factor of about 2.5 from the corners (where the fibers were attached) to 3 Goretube, Inc., 2300 South Calhoun Rd., New Berlin, WI 53151. 57 the center, due to attenuation in the acrylic bars <ref> [61] </ref>. In the E852 system a pulsed nitrogen laser 4 with an average power of 6 mW, a maximum pulse energy of 400 J, and a peak emission of 337 nm, excited a small cylinder of plastic scintillator (0:5 in. thick, 1:0 in. diameter) housed inside the laser enclosure. <p> Here we review the essential features of the ADCs and describe their implementation in the trigger for the 3045 element lead glass array of E852. More detail concerning the ADCs is given in Reference <ref> [61] </ref>. The trigger processor is described in Section 2.6.6.2. 2.6.6.1 Analog to Digital Converters The ADCs were packaged as FASTBUS modules with 32 channels per module. For each channel the input signal above a pre-sampled baseline was integrated and presented to two discriminators and a successive-approximation 12-bit digitizer.

Reference-contexts: Each photon is tracked through the apparatus and vetoed if it strikes either the CID, DEA or misses the active region of the LGD. Photons striking the LGD are simulated by using a GEANT <ref> [66] </ref> generated library of electromagnetic showers. The shower library contains 10,000 showers; 100 showers generated at 100 discrete energies. A shower is stored as an array of 2mm x 2mm x 4mm cells. The discrete energies are chosen to reflect the distribution of photons expected for E852.
