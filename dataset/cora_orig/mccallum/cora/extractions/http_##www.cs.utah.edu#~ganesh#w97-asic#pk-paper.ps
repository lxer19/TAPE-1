Abstract: The matrix transposition operation is a necessary step in several image/video compression/decompression algorithms, in particular the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and its inverse (IDCT), and some distributed arithmetic applications. These algorithms have to be performed at high data-rates, and with a minimum of power dissipation for portable applications. In this paper we describe how the clocked solution is usually implemented, and we present two new asynchronous architectures that perform matrix transposition. These architectures, one based on two-phase signaling, one based on four-phase signaling, have better characteristics than the clocked solution in terms of latency and power, at no cost in area or throughput. We discuss the characteristics of these three architectures and evaluate the relative advantages of each one.

Reference-contexts: This pipeline is very deep, with successive stages performing very different functions at very different rates. One of the stages of the pipeline performs matrix transposition. Matrix transposition appears in the computation of two-dimensional transforms such as the DCT (discrete cosine transform) <ref> [1] </ref> and IDCT (inverse DCT). It is sometimes possible to decompose a two-dimensional transform into two one-dimensional transforms, as is the case for the DCT/IDCT: the one-dimensional DCT is first applied by rows, and then applied by columns. A transposition operation is necessary between the two one-dimensional DCT's. DCT circuits.

Reference-contexts: For interesting values of the size of the data (e.g. 8-point DCT for MPEG compression <ref> [3] </ref>), we can go to a bit-serial implementation to reduce the total amount of hardware. The input and output data to the transpose matrix therefore has to be bit-serial as well. The transposition matrix introduces buffering in the DCT/IDCT pipeline.

Reference-contexts: Also, it is sometimes hard to translate knowledge of idle stages in the pipeline into power savings. Asynchronous pipelines can be used succesfully to solve DSP problems <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. It is not always possible to have a completely asynchronous solution for DSP applications, due to the clocked nature of real-time input and output data.

Reference-contexts: This interconnection yields a repeating 2 fi 2 sub-matrix that can be tiled to obtain the full matrix. Figure 4 shows how this repeating sub-matrix is interconnected. four different processes, named F , E , HV , and P . P is a standard two-phase micro-pipeline control <ref> [8] </ref>. Two P processes are used, one to control the row-mode operation and one to control the column-mode operation. Figure 6 shows a schematic of the micro-pipeline control. Notice that the delay element to match the datapath delay is placed in the forward direction.
