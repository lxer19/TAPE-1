Title: Further Analysis of Minimum Residual Iterations  
Author: Yousef Saad 
Date: August 3, 1997  
Abstract: The convergence behavior of a number of algorithms based on minimizing residual norms over Krylov subspaces, is not well understood. Residual or error bounds currently available are either too loose or depend on unknown constants which can be very large. In this paper we take another look at traditional as well as alternative ways of obtaining upper bounds on residual norms. In particular, we derive new inequalities which utilize Chebyshev polynomials and compare them with standard inequalities.

Reference-contexts: In such situations, Krylov methods will converge faster in general. Another example, is the success of deflation methods for solving linear systems <ref> [1, 9] </ref>, as well as eigenvalue problems [16, 17]. For linear systems, the objective of these techniques is to remove the eigenvalues closest to zero from the spectrum of A, yielding faster convergence in later steps of the iteration. <p> an invariant subspace in K m which makes a sufficiently small angle with r 0 is difficult to verify in practice. 15 Recently, a number of researchers have considered methods in which a Krylov sub--space is augmented by a nearly invariant subspace W, in order to enhance convergence, see e.g., <ref> [1, 14, 9] </ref> and the references therein. The above result shows that one should seek to include at each restart an *-invariant subspace which has sufficient accuracy and whose angle with r 0 is small enough that the relation (35) is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Two types of results have been developed to analyze convergence of Min-Res methods. First, there are inequalities, such as those established by Eisenstat, Elman, and Schultz <ref> [2] </ref>, which do not attempt to be sharp but to establish global convergence of the method. Another category of error or residual bounds attempt to imitate the asymptotic behavior of the method, specifically for Min-Res methods on Krylov subspaces. <p> For example, in the simplest case of the Minimum Residual (MR) method, S is precisely the one-dimensional space spanned by r 0 . To prove convergence of the MR and the restarted Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) methods when A is positive definite, Eisenstat, Elman, and Schultz <ref> [2] </ref> used the lower bound for cos 6 (r 0 ; AS) provided by simply taking s r 0 , yielding, cos 6 (r 0 ; AS) kr 0 kkAr 0 k (6) Define, (A) min j (x; Ax)j kxkkAxk ; (7) so that when r 0 2 S, then cos <p> From the relation, (x; Ax) kxkkAxk = kxk 2 fi kAxk it is immediately seen that (A) kAk This results in the following inequality which has been established in <ref> [2] </ref>: k~rk 1 kAk 2 kr 0 k: (11) An alternative inequality can be obtained by using the same vector s and the following argument, see, e.g., [2, 3, 13]. <p> = kxk 2 fi kAxk it is immediately seen that (A) kAk This results in the following inequality which has been established in [2]: k~rk 1 kAk 2 kr 0 k: (11) An alternative inequality can be obtained by using the same vector s and the following argument, see, e.g., <ref> [2, 3, 13] </ref>. Write (x; Ax) 2 kxk 2 kAxk 2 = (Ax; x) (Ax; x) kAxk 2 : and note that the first term in the right-hand side can again be bounded from below by (A). <p> EndDo We begin by observing that by (6) and (4) the condition j (Ax; x)j c &gt; 0; 8x guarantees convergence of any restarted iteration since the successive subspaces S are assumed to contain the initial residual r 0 . In particular, a well-known convergence result <ref> [2] </ref> is that if A is positive definite then a restarted Min-Res iterative process in which each subspace S contains r 0 , converges for any intial guess x 0 . The set of all Rayleigh quotients (Ax; x)=(x; x) constitutes the field of values of A.
