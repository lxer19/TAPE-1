Title: AN ENERGY-MINIMIZING INTERPOLATION FOR ROBUST MULTIGRID METHODS  
Author: W. L. WAN TONY F. CHAN AND BARRY SMITH 
Abstract: We propose a robust interpolation for multigrid based on the concepts of energy minimization and approximation. The formulation is general; it can be applied to any dimensions. The analysis for one dimension proves that the convergence rate of the resulting multigrid method is independent of the coefficient of the underlying PDE, in addition to being independent of the mesh size. We demonstrate numerically the effectiveness of the multigrid method in two dimensions by applying it to a discontinuous coefficient problem and an oscillatory coefficient problem. We also show using a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem that the energy minimization principle can be applied to solving elliptic problems that are not positive definite.

Reference-contexts: As a result of standard relaxation smoothings, the errors become more oscillatory. Figure 3 shows the effect of 4 and 8 iterations of Gauss-Seidel smoothing applied to a smooth initial error. Such a phenomenon was also discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>. Hence, if we use linear interpolation, it will not be able to approximate the oscillatory error on the coarser subspaces. This fact causes the failure of the standard multigrid method.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. Multigrid methods are widely used as efficient solvers for second order elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) because of their often optimal convergence behavior; that is, their convergence rate is independent of the mesh size. Optimal theory can be found, for example, in <ref> [2, 3, 4, 20, 27, 31, 38, 39] </ref>. However, the convergence rate may depend on the nature of the coefficients in the PDE. Typically, the convergence deteriorates as the coefficients become rougher. <p> Optimal theory can be found, for example, in [2, 3, 4, 20, 27, 31, 38, 39]. However, the convergence rate may depend on the nature of the coefficients in the PDE. Typically, the convergence deteriorates as the coefficients become rougher. Specifically, if the coefficients are anisotropic <ref> [20] </ref>, have large jumps [1, 5, 10, 11] or are highly oscillatory [17, 26, 34], standard multigrid methods will converge very slowly. <p> Classical convergence theory shows that these simple ingredients are enough to achieve optimal convergence for smooth coefficient problems. In general, however, these choices may lead to slow convergence. In one dimension, to remedy the situation, a more robust interpolation <ref> [20, 28, 36] </ref> can be used. It is obtained by solving local homogeneous PDEs, which are equivalent to minimizing the energy of the coarse grid basis functions. The extension of this approach to higher dimensions is not obvious. <p> It is obtained by solving local homogeneous PDEs, which are equivalent to minimizing the energy of the coarse grid basis functions. The extension of this approach to higher dimensions is not obvious. Nonetheless, many attempts <ref> [1, 10, 20, 19, 24, 29, 36] </ref> have been made to set up similar local PDEs for defining a robust interpolation. <p> Stability and Approximation Property. Before we explain the formulation of the energy-minimizing interpolation, we first discuss our motivation from the classical results of multigrid and domain decomposition methods. Two key properties, stability and approximation, must be satisfied by the coarse subspaces and the smoothers <ref> [20] </ref> in order to have optimal convergence results. These two terms occur frequently in the literature but often appear in slightly different forms. <p> Energy-minimizing Interpolation. In this section, we introduce the energy minimization approach to constructing the interpolation. The resulting formulation in the one-dimensional case is well known in the literature <ref> [20, 28, 36] </ref>. We explain the energy-minimizing interpolation in one dimension first and then in two dimensions. 3.1. One Dimension. We consider the following model problem: dx d u (x) = f in (0,1)(5) where a (x) and f (x) are integrable and a (x) is uniformly positive. <p> Since our interpolation depends on the matrix A h , sometimes it is called a matrix-dependent interpolation in the algebraic multigrid context. The resulting interpolation was also described in <ref> [20, 28, 36] </ref> but from a different point of view. Ours is novel in the sense that we interpret it from the energy-minimization principle, which provides a clue to developing similar interpolation operators in higher dimensions. The approximation property (4) is closely related to preserving constant functions. <p> Thus, the interpolation derived from the energy-minimizing coarse grid basis functions preserves constants. Remarks: (1) If a (x) is piecewise constant, this interpolation preserves the continuity of the flux, a (x)ru, at the discontinuities <ref> [20] </ref>. (2) If red-black Gauss-Seidel is used as a smoother, the resulting multigrid method coincides with the cyclic reduction method in the numerical linear algebra context. 5 3.2. Higher Dimensions. The construction of the energy-minimizing interpolation described in this section is valid for two and three dimensions. <p> In higher dimensions, however, the boundaries consist of both coarse grid and noncoarse grid points, and hence local boundary value problems apparently do not exist. Nevertheless, several possibilities for setting up local PDEs are discussed in the literature, for instance, the stencil or the so-called black-box multigrid approach <ref> [1, 10, 11, 20, 19, 23, 24, 36, 40] </ref>, the Schur complement approach [18, 25, 29], and the algebraic multigrid approach [8, 9, 35], each of which mimics the one-dimensional case in some way. Our approach is based on the observation (8).

In this paper, we study the design of multigrid methods from the energy minimization point of view, which gives powerful insight into the design of robust multigrid methods.

Typically, the convergence deteriorates as the coefficients become rougher. <p> Two key properties, stability and approximation, must be satisfied by the coarse subspaces and the smoothers [20] in order to have optimal convergence results. These two terms occur frequently in the literature but often appear in slightly different forms. For example, in the subspace correction framework <ref> [39] </ref>, these two properties are built into the estimate of a constant K 0 , which in turn is used to prove optimal convergence together with another constant K 1 . <p> Then E J = (I T J )(I T J1 ) (I T 1 ); kE J k 2 2 ! 1 where ! 1 = max 1iJ ae (R i A i ). Proof. See <ref> [39] </ref>. By Theorem 2.1, the convergence rate can be improved by producing a smaller K 0 or K 1 . <p> In this paper, we propose an interpolation that will potentially decrease the size of the constant K 0 by reducing its dependence on the coefficients of the underlying elliptic PDE. 2 As shown in <ref> [39] </ref>, the estimate of K 0 relies on two inequalities: k ~ Q 1 vk 2 J X k ( ~ Q k ~ Q k1 )vk 2 A ;(3) where ~ Q k : V ! V k is any linear operator onto V k . <p> If R k = R GS k , then ! 1 &lt; 2. Proof. The bound for K 1 is a direct consequence of Lemma 4.6 in <ref> [39] </ref> and the fact that P i P j = 0 for i 6= j. <p> In Section 2, we claimed that if the stability and the approximation properties (3), (4) are satisfied, the parameter K 0 can be bounded by a constant independent of the mesh size. Note that the following result is stated without proof in <ref> [39] </ref>. Lemma A.1. Let ! 0 = min 2iJ (ae (A i ) min (R i )). Suppose (3) and (4) are satisfied. Then K 0 ! 0 Proof.
