Thirty MeV to greater than a GeV emission has been observed to last as long or longer than the emission observed by BATSE. In GRB940217, high energy emission is observed in the next orbit over an hour after the BATSE detection, and the highest energy gamma ray was ~ 20 GeV. Also, EGRET has collected spectra in the energy range of 1 MeV to 200 MeV that have been combined with observations from other instruments to yield spectra spanning up to four orders of magnitude in energy. We propose to continue analyzing the EGRET data from the gamma ray bursts in Cycle 6. Archival analysis will be done as well. The 1-200 MeV spectra will be studied for temporal trends within a burst. Upper limits from 1 MeV to greater than a GeV will be compared with extrapolations of observations at lower energies.
