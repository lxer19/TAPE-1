Abstract: The problem of driving an autonomous vehicle in highway traffic engages many areas of AI research and has substantial economic significance. We describe work in progress on a new approach to this problem based on a decision-theoretic architecture using dynamic probabilistic networks. The architecture provides a sound solution to the problems of sensor noise, sensor failure, and uncertainty about the behavior of other vehicles and about the effects of one's own actions. Our approach has been implemented in a computer simulation system, and the autonomous vehicle successfully negotiates a variety of difficult situations.

Reference-contexts: This is either a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on one's viewpoint. Because the necessary low-level capabilities such as visual vehicle monitoring [ Huang et al., 1994 ] and lane-following <ref> [ Dickmanns and Zapp, 1987; Pomerleau, 1993 ] </ref> are reaching maturity, we have decided to confront this challenge. The first phase of the project is a feasibility study to establish the computational and sensing requirements for driving and to investigate the nature of the necessary decision algorithms.

Reference-contexts: One exception is the work of Niehaus and Sten-gel <ref> [ Niehaus and Stengel, 1991 ] </ref> , who have recently incorporated a somewhat ad hoc form of probabilistic reasoning into their rule-based driving controller. Since their system assumes worst-case outcomes in looking ahead, and does not integrate percepts over time in assessing the current state, its performance is limited.

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic networks are directed acyclic graphs in which nodes represent random variables (typically discrete) and arcs represent causal connections among the variables <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . Associated with each node is a CPT (conditional probability table) that provides conditional probabilities of the node's possible states given each possible state of its parents (or the prior probabilities if the node has no parents). <p> When specific values are observed for some of the nodes in a probabilistic network, posterior probability distributions can be computed efficiently for any of the other nodes using a variety of inference algorithms <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . DPNs allow for reasoning in domains where variables take on different values over time [ Dean and Kanazawa, 1988 ] . observations are taken at regular `time slices,' and a given network structure is replicated for each slice.

Reference-contexts: It first slows down and waits for an opening in the traffic before accelerating and changes lanes to the left. Clearly, much remains to be done. We are currently investigating the application of new learning algorithms to construct DPNs automatically from time series data <ref> [ Russell et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Combined with our computer vision subsystem, this will allow the construction of human driver models from videotapes. In our network representation, we are working to incorporate continuous variables, thereby avoiding the combinatorial explosion caused by discretization.

Reference-contexts: The sensor model in a DDN is similar to that in a DPN; the state evolution model, on the other hand, now includes the action node as a parent, and therefore represents the effects of the BAT's actions. Tatman and Shachter <ref> [ Tatman and Shachter, 1990 ] </ref> provide an algorithm for computing the policy for a DDN. In the case of driving, which is a partially observable problem, only a subset of the variables in a given time slice will be instantiated as evidence.
