Abstract: In many applications in mobile robotics, it is important for a robot to explore its environment in order to construct a representation of space useful for guiding movement. We refer to such a representation as a map, and the process of constructing a map from a set of measurements as map learning. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing map-learning problems in which the measurements taken by the robot are subject to known errors. We investigate two approaches to learning maps under such conditions: one based on Valiant's probably approximately correct learning model, and a second based on Rivest & Sloan's reliable and probably nearly almost always useful learning model. Both methods deal with the problem of accumulated error in combining local measurements to make global inferences. In the first approach, the effects of accumulated error are eliminated by the use of reliable and probably useful methods for discerning the local properties of space. In the second, the effects of accumulated error are reduced to acceptable levels by repeated exploration of the area to be learned. Finally, we suggest some insights into why certain existing techniques for map learning perform as well as they do.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we explore a number of problems involved in constructing useful maps from measurements taken with sensors subject to known errors. In previous work <ref> [ Dean, 1988 ] </ref> , we have looked at various optimization problems related to constructing maps (e.g., construct the most accurate map consistent with a set of measurements). Even in cases involving only a single dimension, such optimization problems can turn out to be NP-hard [ Yemini, 1979 ] .

Reference-contexts: section, we are concerned with the conditions under which a graph can be completely learned, and how much time will be required for the exploration and assimilation. 3.1 Tessellation Graphs It's not hard to see that any connected, undirected graph can be completely learned easily if there is no uncertainty; <ref> [ Kuipers and Byun, 1988 ] </ref> describes a way of doing this by building up an agenda consisting of unexplored paths leading out of locations and then moving about so as to eventually explore all such paths. Nothing about the graph need be known before the exploration begins.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we consider two related approaches. Kuipers defines the notion of "place" in terms of a set of related visual events <ref> [ Kuipers, 1978 ] </ref> . This notion provides a basis for inducing graphs from measurements. In Kuipers' framework [ 1988 ] , locations are arranged in an unrestricted planar graph.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, rather than look at problems that involve doing the best with what you have, we consider problems that involve going out and getting what you need to generate useful representations. In particular, we consider a form of reliable and probably almost always useful learning <ref> [ Rivest and Sloan, 1988 ] </ref> in which the robot gathers information to ensure that it nearly always (with probability 1 ffi) can provide a guaranteed perfect path from one location to another. <p> The above approach to map learning was inspired by Rivest's model of learning <ref> [ Rivest and Sloan, 1988 ] </ref> , in which complex problems are broken down into simple subproblems that can be learned independently.
