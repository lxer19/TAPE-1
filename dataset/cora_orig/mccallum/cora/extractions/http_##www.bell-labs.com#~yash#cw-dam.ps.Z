Abstract: Crumbling walls are a general class of quorum systems. The elements (processors) of a wall are logically arranged in rows of varying widths. A quorum in a wall is the union of one full row and a representative from every row below the full row. This class considerably generalizes a number of known quorum system constructions. In this paper we study the availability of crumbling wall quorum systems. We show that if the row width is bounded, or if the number of rows is bounded, then the wall's failure probability F p does not vanish as the number of elements tends to infinity (i.e., F p is not Condorcet). If the wall may grow in both the row number and row width, we show that the behavior depends on the rate of growth of the row width. We establish a sharp threshold rate: when the row width n i blog 2 2ic then F p is Condorcet, and when n i (1 + ") log 2 i then F p is not Condorcet.

Reference-contexts: A desirable asymptotic behavior of F p is that F p ! 0 when n ! 1 for all p &lt; 1 2 , and such an F p is called Condorcet, after <ref> [Con] </ref>. The Crumbling Walls class of quorum system constructions was introduced in [PW95b]. The construction is defined as follows. The elements are arranged in rows, and a quorum is the union of one full row and a single representative from every row below the full row. <p> When we consider the asymptotic behavior of F p (S n ) for a sequence S n of quorum systems over a universe with an increasing size n, we find that for many constructions it is similar to the behavior described by the Condorcet Jury Theorem <ref> [Con] </ref>. Hence, the following definition of [PW95a]. Definition 2.10 A parameterized family of functions g p (n) : N ! [0; 1], for p 2 [0; 1], is said to be Condorcet iff lim n!1 ( 2 , 2 , 2 for all n.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is somewhat surprising that this is not true for all wall families.

Reference-contexts: Our emphasis is on the asymptotic behavior of the failure probability F p , and in particular we investigate when F p is or is not Condorcet. The asymptotic availability of the Sngl, Triang, Grid and Wheel crumbling walls has been analyzed in <ref> [KC91, RST92, PW95a] </ref>. All four of these constructions share the property that their failure probabilities are not Condorcet, i.e., when n increases, F p does not vanish when p &lt; 1 2 .

Reference-contexts: A desirable asymptotic behavior of F p is that F p ! 0 when n ! 1 for all p &lt; 1 2 , and such an F p is called Condorcet, after [Con]. The Crumbling Walls class of quorum system constructions was introduced in <ref> [PW95b] </ref>. The construction is defined as follows. The elements are arranged in rows, and a quorum is the union of one full row and a single representative from every row below the full row. <p> Special emphasis is given in <ref> [PW95b] </ref> to the CWlog system, which is a wall with row width n i = blg 2ic. 2 It is shown that CWlog has many advantageous properties, such as log-sized quorums and low load. Calculations demonstrate that CWlog has high availability for small systems, with n 100. <p> A coterie S is called dominated if there exists a coterie R such that R S. If no such coterie exists then S is non-dominated (ND). Let NDC denote the class of all ND coteries. The following proposition of [Nei92] and <ref> [PW95b] </ref> shows that the Lovasz coteries of [Nei92] are the only ND walls constructions. Proposition 2.4 CWhni 2 NDC iff n 1 = 1 and n i 2 for all 2 i d. 2.2 The Probabilistic Failure Model We use a simple probabilistic model of the failures in the system. <p> Definition 2.10 A parameterized family of functions g p (n) : N ! [0; 1], for p 2 [0; 1], is said to be Condorcet iff lim n!1 ( 2 , 2 , 2 for all n. Below we list some of the basic results of <ref> [PW95b] </ref> which we need in the asymptotic analysis. These results give formulas for the failure probability of a crumbling wall, and show that walls with monotone increasing row widths have the best availability among all the row permutations. <p> Notation: Let F p (i) denote F p of the sub-wall of the top i rows of CWhni. Fact 2.11 <ref> [PW95b] </ref> Let CWhni be given. Then the sub-wall failure probability F p (i) obeys the recurrence ( F p (1) = 1 q n 1 ; Fact 2.12 [PW95b] The failure probability of a wall CWhni on d rows with n 1 = 1 is F p (CWhni) = d X <p> Notation: Let F p (i) denote F p of the sub-wall of the top i rows of CWhni.

Reference-contexts: Set systems with the intersection property are known as quorum systems, and the sets in such a system are called quorums. Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as mutual exclusion (cf. <ref> [Ray86] </ref>), data replication protocols (cf. [DGS85, Her84]), name servers (cf. [MV88]), selective dissemination of information (cf. [YG94]), and distributed access control and signatures (cf. [NW96]). A protocol template based on quorum systems works as follows.

Reference-contexts: Our emphasis is on the asymptotic behavior of the failure probability F p , and in particular we investigate when F p is or is not Condorcet. The asymptotic availability of the Sngl, Triang, Grid and Wheel crumbling walls has been analyzed in <ref> [KC91, RST92, PW95a] </ref>. All four of these constructions share the property that their failure probabilities are not Condorcet, i.e., when n increases, F p does not vanish when p &lt; 1 2 . Therefore it is somewhat surprising that this is not true for all wall families. <p> In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced. Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries are proved. Alternative protocols based on quorum systems (rather than on voting) appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), [AE91] (the Tree system), [CAA90, KRS93] (using a grid), <ref> [Kum91, KC91, RT91, RST92] </ref> (hierarchical systems). The triangular system is due to [Lov73, EL75]. A generalization of the triangular system appears in [Nei92] under the name Lovasz coteries. The Wheel system appears in [MP92]. In [HMP95], the question of how evenly balanced the work load can be is studied.

Reference-contexts: The case when the elements fail with different probabilities p i , all less than 1 2 , is addressed in <ref> [SB94] </ref>. The first paper to explicitly consider mutual exclusion protocols in the context of intersecting set systems is [GB85]. In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced. Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries are proved.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is somewhat surprising that this is not true for all wall families. Specifically, we prove that the CWlog wall has a failure probability that is Condorcet. 1.2 Related Work The first distributed control protocols using quorum systems <ref> [Tho79, Gif79] </ref> use voting to define the quorums. Each processor has a number of votes, and a quorum is any set of processors with a combined number of votes exceeding half of the system's total number of votes.

In order to perform some action (e.g., update the database, enter a critical section), the user selects a quorum and accesses all its elements.
