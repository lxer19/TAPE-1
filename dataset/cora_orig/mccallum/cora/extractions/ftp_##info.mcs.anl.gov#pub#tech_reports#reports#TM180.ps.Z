Reference-contexts: Although the field of applications of the method of integration by parts is somewhat limited, the method is very powerful when it works. Precise theorems of sufficient generality are difficult to formulate; examples can be found in <ref> [1, Section 2.1] </ref> and [2, Chapter 3]. 1 Because of the limited usefulness of those theorems, we prefer to illustrate the method with a very simple example to get the idea across. <p> For example, results similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2 hold if x is a complex parameter and x ! 1 in the complex plane within any sector S = fx 2 C : j arg (x)j g with &lt; 1 2 . We refer the reader to <ref> [1, Section 2.2] </ref> for details. 3 Laplace's Method The essence of Theorem 2 is that, under certain circumstances, the asymptotic behavior of a Laplace-type integral as x ! 1 is determined by the asymptotic behavior of its integrand as t # a. This result extends to more general situations. <p> This result is not very good, as F a;b (f )(x) = o (1) in this case. Fortunately, we can do better, thanks to a method developed by Erdelyi for functions f that are weakly singular near the endpoints a and b; see <ref> [1, Section 2.8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The function fl fl (a; x) = x a fl (a; x)=(a) is a single-valued analytic function of a and x, possessing no finite singularities. Use Mathematica to draw the graph of fl fl on the rectangle f (a; x) : jaj 5; jxj 4g. Compare the result with <ref> [3, Figure 6.3] </ref>. 3. Use the asymptotic expansion of the -function obtained above to derive the asymptotic expansion of the complementary error function, erfc (x) = 2 x dt = n=0 2 ) x 2n+1 as x ! 1: 4. <p> Use the duplication formula for the -function, (2x) = (2) 1=2 2 2x1=2 (x)(x + 1 2 ), to fix the arbitrary constant and establish the asymptotic expansion log (x) = (x 1 2 log (2) + n=1 2n (2n 1) Here, B n is the nth Bernoulli number; cf. <ref> [3, Section 23.1] </ref>. 7 2. When x is positive, the logarithmic integral li (x) is defined by li (x) = 0 log t the integral being a Cauchy principal value (P ) when x &gt; 1.
