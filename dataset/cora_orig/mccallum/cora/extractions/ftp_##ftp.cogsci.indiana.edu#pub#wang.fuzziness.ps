Title: The Interpretation of Fuzziness

Abstract: Without a clear interpretation of fuzziness, it is hard for fuzzy logic to justify its rules, to get initial data from users, or to make its results understandable. It is possible to interpret grade of membership, at least in some cases, as the proportion of positive evidence. In this way, fuzziness and randomness can be uniformly treated.

Reference-contexts: This equation can be generalized to all fuzzy concepts of the type 1 by considering S (y) : C ! (1; 1) as a measurement corresponding to the relation "R-er than", and P (x) : (1; 1) ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as the probability distribution of objects in C with respect to S (y). In this way, we get a function that calculates the membership of an object from a fundamental argument, as Zadeh did (see section 1). However, there is a basic difference. <p> What follows naturally is the relation between fuzziness and randomness, where the latter is usually handled by probability 1 Tversky's contrast model cannot be written into a ratio, but it is not a counter example of the above observation, since it is not defined on <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. 8 theory. Probability is closely related to the ratio (or frequency, proportion) of positive evidence among all relevant evidence, so can also be represented as w + w , or its limits. <p> Probability is closely related to the ratio (or frequency, proportion) of positive evidence among all relevant evidence, so can also be represented as w + w , or its limits.

Reference-contexts: Since "the source of imprecision is the absence of sharply defined criteria of class membership rather than the presence of random variables", and "the notion of a fuzzy set is completely nonstatistical in nature", probability theory cannot be applied here. A new theory is needed (also see <ref> [3] </ref>). Based on these intuitions, he defined the concept of fuzzy set, the relations between fuzzy sets (equal and containment), and operations on fuzzy sets (complement, union, and intersection), which become the kernel of the "fuzzy family" (fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, fuzzy control system, and so on).

Reference-contexts: the uncertainty in "A is similar to B" is jS A "S B j jS A [S B j , where S A and S B are the set of properties for A and B, respectively (both formulas are special cases of ratio model of similarity, defined by Tversky in <ref> [22] </ref>). 7 Now, if we replace the A in the above two formulas by a variable X, the formulas become B's membership function, corresponding to the two interpretations of similarity (symmetric and asymmetric).

Reference-contexts: However, the same is also true for fuzziness ([26]), so randomness and fuzziness can still be similarly processed. 9 detailed discussions on this issue, see [26] and <ref> [25] </ref>. 6 Discussions In this paper, a frequency interpretation of fuzziness is suggested, which has the following advantages: * Different types of uncertainty, such as fuzziness, randomness, ignorance, and so on, can be processed by an unified mechanism; * The membership function can be generated and modified by the system itself,

Reference-contexts: In NARS, fuzziness and randomness are processed in a symmetrical way (see <ref> [26] </ref> for detail), and they are different in how the evidence is collected. If these two types of uncertainty are different, why bother to treat them in an uniform way? The basic reason is: in many practical problems, they are involved with each other. <p> However, the same is also true for fuzziness (<ref> [26] </ref>), so randomness and fuzziness can still be similarly processed. 9 detailed discussions on this issue, see [26] and [25]. 6 Discussions In this paper, a frequency interpretation of fuzziness is suggested, which has the following advantages: * Different types of uncertainty, such as fuzziness, randomness, ignorance, and so on, can be processed by an unified mechanism; * The membership function can be generated and modified by the

Reference-contexts: They sometimes obviously lead to counter-intuitive results. For example, in <ref> [33] </ref> Zadeh define big = long ^ wide ^ high, but long fi wide fi high looks much more reasonable than minf long ; wide ; high g as big's membership function. Some psychological results are also inconsistent with the results predicted by the min rule ([16, 21]).

Reference-contexts: Such a compatibility have no frequency interpretation. By "The membership of John's age to `young' is 0.7", we don't mean that John's age is a random number, which takes the value "young" in 70% of the times. In <ref> [34] </ref>, Zadeh proposed a "Possibility/probability consistency principle": a lessening of the possibility of an event tends to lessen its probability | but not vice versa. 2 4.
