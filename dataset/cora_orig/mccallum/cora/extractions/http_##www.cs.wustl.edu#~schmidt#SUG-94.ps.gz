Abstract: Earlier versions of this paper appeared in the 11 th and 12 th Sun User Group conferences in San Jose, California, Dec. 7-9, 1993 and San Francisco, California, June 14-17, 1993. Abstract This paper describes the structure and functionality of ACE and illustrates core ACE features using examples from domains like telecommunications, enterprise medical imaging, and WWW services. ACE is freely available and is being used for many commercial projects (such as Ericsson, Bell-core, Siemens, Motorola, Kodak, and McDonnell Douglas), as well as many academic and industrial research projects. ACE has been ported to a variety of OS platforms including Win32 and most UNIX/POSIX implementations. In addition, both C++ and Java versions of ACE are available.
