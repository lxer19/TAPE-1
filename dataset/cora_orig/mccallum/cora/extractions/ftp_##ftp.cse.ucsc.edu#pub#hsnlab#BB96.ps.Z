Abstract: In this paper we study the performance of an explicit rate allocation algorithm for ATM networks using the available bit-rate (ABR) class of service. We examine the behavior of ABR traffic with simple cell sources, and demonstrate that the allocation algorithm is fair and maintains network efficiency in a variety of network configurations. We also study the behavior of TCP/IP sources using ABR service in a network of switches employing the rate allocation algorithm; the results show substantial improvements in fairness and efficiency in comparison with the performance of TCP in an underlying datagram-based network. We study the performance of ABR traffic in the presence of higher-priority variable bit-rate (VBR) video traffic and show that the overall system achieves high utilization with modest queue sizes in the switches, and the ABR flows adapt to the available rate in a fairly short interval. We also demonstrate the scalability of the rate allocation algorithm with respect to the number of connections.

Reference-contexts: Networks based on ATM combine the flexibility of packet-switched networks with the service guarantees and predictability offered by circuit-switched networks. Several service classes have been defined in the context of ATM networks. The Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) service class <ref> [Giroux, 1995] </ref>, defined to support delay tolerant best-effort applications, uses rate-based feedback mechanisms to allow them to adjust their transmission rates to make full utilization of the available bandwidth [Bonomi, 1995]. Compliant connections are also assured of a low loss rate, and if needed, a minimum bandwidth allocation.

Detailed information on the ATM Forum's source policy as well as a complete description of the rate allocation algorithm under investigation can be found in <ref> [Bonomi, 1995, Kalampoukas, 1995b] </ref>. According to the ATM Forum's framework, the source of a connection (VC) transmits cells at a rate allowed by the network, termed the allowed cell rate (ACR), until it receives new information in an RM cell that it had transmitted previously.

Reference-contexts: With the explicit rate scheme, switches communicate in the RM cell, the amount of instantaneous bandwidth it can allocate to each connection to the source of the connection. The goal of the allocation is to arrive at an efficient allocation that is also max-min fair <ref> [Bertsekas, 1992] </ref>. Several rate allocation algorithms using the explicit-rate option have been proposed [Charny, 1994, Kalampoukas, 1995a, Jain, 1995]. In this work we study the dynamics and evaluate the performance of the rate allocation algorithm proposed in [Kalampoukas, 1995a].

Traditionally, feedback-based congestion control mechanisms have shown a bias towards flows with shorter round-trip times when they co-exist with long round-trip time flows.

Reference-contexts: An important observation we make is that the same set of parameters are used for both WAN and LAN configurations which have widely different characteristics. When simulating TCP over ATM, we use the ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL 5) <ref> [I363] </ref>. AAL 5 performs segmentation and re-assembly between IP packets and ATM cells. Each IP packet is extended by eight bytes to accommodate the AAL header. Thus, the number of ATM cells produced by the original IP datagram is given by ~ IP packet size+8 48 .

Reference-contexts: Thus, the number of ATM cells produced by the original IP datagram is given by ~ IP packet size+8 48 . The model for TCP used in the simulations is based on the TCP-Reno version. It supports the congestion control mechanism described by Jacobson <ref> [Jacobson, 1988] </ref>, ex three connections in the R1 configuration. ponential back-off, enhanced round-trip (RTT) estimation based on both the mean and the variance of the measured RTT, and the fast retransmit and fast recovery mechanisms. <p> The TCP congestion control algorithm is based on end-to-end windows and consists of several components. Key components are the slow-start algorithm, a congestion-avoidance mechanism, and an algorithm to estimate round-trip delays <ref> [Jacobson, 1988] </ref>. The TCP Reno Version, introduced in 1990, added the fast retransmit and fast recovery algorithm to avoid performing slow-start when the level of congestion in the network is not severe to warrant congestion recovery by slow-start.

Reference-contexts: All the ABR connections request peak bandwidth. The VBR connections have an allocated bandwidth, which is based on the average rate for the video data generated by the application. The VBR traffic is based on the model described in <ref> [Heyman, 1992] </ref>. One frame of video data is generated approximately every 1/25 seconds (the model assumes a PAL system, not an NTSC system which transmits 30 frames/sec) and the size of the frame expressed in number of cells follows the probability density function given in Figure 10.
