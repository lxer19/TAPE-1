Abstract: b. Determine the diameter of SE k . Solution: The diameter of SE k is 2k 1. First, consider any two nodes u = u 1 u k and v = v 1 v k in SE k . To construct a path from u to v, we simply cycle through all the bits of u by traversing shuffle edges, making sure to change bits as necessary by traversing exchange edges. Thus, we start by traversing an exchange edge (if necessary) as follows: Now we traverse edges as follows: where the first transformation traverses a shuffle edge and the second traverses an exchange edge if necessary. The resulting path has k 1 shuffle edges and at most k exchange edges, for a total of 2k 1 edges overall. This establishes an upper bound. A lower bound follows by considering any path from 0 0 to 1 1. Any such path must traverse k different exchange edges to change the 0's into 1's, and since exchange edges are nonadjacent, there must be at least k 1 shuffle edges between them. c. Determine the bisection width of SE k . Solution: The bisection width of SE k is fi(2 k =k). The proof is fairly complicated, so pay close attention. As always, we prove a fi bound by proving the corresponding O and upper and lower bounds. To prove that the diameter of SE k is O(2 k =k), we must find an O(2 k =k)-set of edges that bisect the node set of SE k . To do this, it is useful to embed SE k in the complex plane, as follows. Let ! k = e 2i=k denote a u 1 u 2 u k1 u k ! u 1 u 2 u k1 v 1 :
