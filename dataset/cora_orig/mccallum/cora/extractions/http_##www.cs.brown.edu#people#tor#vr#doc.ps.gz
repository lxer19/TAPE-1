Reference-contexts: External modules talk to Geomview using the Geomview Command Language (GCL), which provides support for controlling almost all aspects of Geomview's behavior. Geomview can display manifolds through discrete group support and an external module, Maniview <ref> [Gun93] </ref>. Maniview provides a user interface for loading and displaying 3-manifolds. While a manifold is infinite in extent, graphics hardware can only display a finite number of polygons. <p> The complete interface should be capable of all the things currently possible in Maniview. Developing such a complex interface with the low resolution of today's helmet displays calls for creative solutions, such as virtual data column used by the Sparcchair [Rei93]. Charlie Gunn <ref> [Gun93] </ref> suggests that using sound in a virtual environment may help in exploring and understanding manifolds. Determining echo patterns in a manifold is a challenging and interesting problem. Not all work in non-euclidean spaces deals directly with mathematics.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The mathematical study of different spaces and manifolds has shown that these entities have interesting visual properties. Recently software has been written that allows a user to visualize different spaces and manifolds <ref> [LMP93] </ref>. However, this software only provides a small window into these fantastic spaces. To obtain a more interesting and helpful window into these worlds, we turn to a Virtual Environment (VE) system. <p> The tracking system tracks 360 ffi in yaw and 45 ffi in pitch and roll. The helmet is shown in Figure 10. 3.2 Software Base The display engine of the three-manifold virtual environment is a modified version of Geomview <ref> [LMP93] </ref>, a mathematics visualization program written and distributed by the Geometry Center, a National Science and Technology Research Center. Geomview supports viewing in all three spaces discussed | euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic. Geomview runs on Silicon Graphics, 10 NeXT, and plain X11 workstations.
