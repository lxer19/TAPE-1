Abstract: We consider the problem of privacy in a 3D multi-user collaborative environment. We assume that information objects are represented by visual icons, and can either be public or private, and that users need effective methods for viewing and manipulating that state. We suggest two methods, which we call vampire mirrors and privacy lamps, that are unobtrusive, simple, and natural.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Privacy is an important issue in the design of any multi-user system. We present two methods for visually representing and manipulating the privacy state of objects in multi-user 3D environments. These methods are being developed for a proposed networked collaborative immersive environment <ref> [3] </ref> incorporating camera imagery and synthesized graphics [5]. Each user will sit in a physical telecubicle whose two walls and desk are stereo projection displays. A set of up to four remote telecubicles will be assembled electronically into one large virtual room (see Figs. 1 and 2).
