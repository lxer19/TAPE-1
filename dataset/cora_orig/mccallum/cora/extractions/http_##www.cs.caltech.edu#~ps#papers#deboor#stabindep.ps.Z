Abstract: CMS Technical Summary Report #95-07 February 1995 ABSTRACT Due to their so-called time-frequency localization properties, wavelets have become a powerful tool in signal analysis and image processing. Typical constructions of wavelets depend on the stability of the shifts of an underlying refinable L 2 function. In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the shifts of certain compactly supported refinable functions. These conditions are in terms of the zeros of the refinement mask. Our results are actually applicable to more general distributions which are not of function type, if we generalize the notion of stability appropriately. We also provide a similar characterization of the (global) linear independence of the shifts. We present several examples illustrating our results, as well as one example in which known results on box splines are derived using the theorems of this paper.

Reference-contexts: However, for refinable it is actually more desirable to characterize these properties in terms of the mask A. At least in the case d = 1, characterizing orthonormality can be based on characterizations of stability via the (1.5)Result <ref> [C] </ref>. Suppose 2 L 2 (IR) is refinable with mask A. Then the shifts of are orthonormal if and only if (i) A (0) = 1 and jAj 2 + jA ( + )j 2 = 1; (ii) The shifts of are ` 2 -stable.

We should also point out that the easily verifiable assumption that A ~ () be zero is very reasonable. For example, the proof of Theorem 2.4 from <ref> [JM] </ref> shows that b ~ vanishes on the set 2ZZ d n0 whenever b ~ vanishes at infinity. If the shifts of ~ are suitable, this in turn implies that A ~ () is zero.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it is desirable to characterize the properties of a multiresolution in terms of this refinement mask. In dimensions greater than one, the problem of wavelet construction is much more challenging. However, in dimensions no greater than three, a method for construction is given in <ref> [RS] </ref>. Compactly supported wavelets are constructed based solely on the refinement mask of a symmetric compactly supported real-valued function , the shifts of which are orthonormal.
