Abstract: We present a general approach to flexible plan adaptation based on a deductive framework that enables a planner to correctly adapt complex plans containing control structures like conditionals and loops.

Reference-contexts: The mrl system provides the reuse component of the phi planner which is working in a help-system application. Here, plans are generated to provide active help to users of software environments <ref> (Bauer et al. 1993) </ref>. This means that plans are required to meet exactly the user's goals and to be as simple as possible. Therefore, control structures are only reused in a restricted way in the implemented system mrl.

Reference-contexts: The underlying planning formalism is the modal temporal logic LLP that possesses an interval-based semantics <ref> (Biundo, Dengler, & Koehler 1992) </ref>. LLP provides the modal operators ffi (next), - (sometimes), ut (always) and the binary modal operator ; (chop) which expresses the sequential composition of formulae.

Reference-contexts: During the proof, the planvariable Plan is replaced by a plan formula meeting the specification. The proofs are guided by tactics which can be described in a tactic language <ref> (Dengler 1994) </ref> provided by the system, an idea which was borrowed from the field of tactical theorem proving (Constable 1986; Paulson 1990). The application domain of phi is the unix mail domain where objects like messages and mailboxes are manipulated by actions like read, delete, and save. <p> The tactic specifies a well-defined ordering of deduction rule applications. It is composed of tacticals <ref> (Dengler 1994) </ref> like iterate rule, apply rule strict, and call tac. Each tactical specifies a specific mode of rule or tactic applications.

Reference-contexts: While plan reuse and adaptation have been studied in extensions to strips-based planners, such as priar (Kambhampati & Hendler 1992) and spa <ref> (Hanks & Weld 1992) </ref>, no approaches have tackled the problem in the context of deductive planning (Green 1969; Manna & Waldinger 1987). The deductive planning approach to adaptation leads to adapted plans which are provably correct.

Reference-contexts: How does the evaluation validate or illuminate your theory of adaptation of knowledge for reuse? The results revealed various influence factors making reuse and adaptation more or less efficient than generation from scratch <ref> (Koehler 1994b) </ref>. The system showed a predictable behavior corresponding to the theoreti cal expectations. 5.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, since plan adaptation is done deductively, a semantic comparison of planning problems is possible instead of a syntactic match. A general formalism with clearly defined semantics is obtained and the formal view facilitates the investigation of theoretical properties <ref> (Nebel & Koehler 1995) </ref>. While current approaches are limited to the adaptation of sequential plans containing no control structures, this approach enables a system to automatically adapt sequential, conditional, and iterative plans. <p> What type of evaluation? We varied the types of plans, plan adaptation strategies, sizes of plan libraries, application domains, and the degree of similarity of planning problems during the empirical evaluation. Complexity-theoretic analyses <ref> (Nebel & Koehler 1995) </ref> of plan reuse versus plan generation complement the empirical studies. 3. What comparisons were made with other methods? The overall performance of mrl was compared to priar and spa. The comparison demonstrated that deductive planning and reuse can compete very well with strips-based planners.
