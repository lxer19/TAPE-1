Abstract: Let an algebraic variety over a zero-characteristic ground field be given as a set of common zeros of a family of polynomials of the degree less than d in n variables. In this paper the following algorithms with the working time polynomial in the size of input and d n are constructed: an algorithm for the computation of the degrees of algebraic varieties, an algorithm for the computation of the dimension of the given algebraic variety in the neighborhood of a given point, an algorithm for the computation of the multiplicity of a given point of the algebraic variety, an algorithm for the computation smooth points with their tangent spaces on each component of a given algebraic variety.

Reference-contexts: We consider an algebraically closed field of zero characteristic as an extension of degree 2 of a real ordered field. The required property can be formulated over this real ordered field. After that we can apply the "transfer principle", see <ref> [1] </ref>, and reduce everything to the case of the field of real numbers. For this field we have a developed theory. The result from [14] is crucial which in its turn is based on the result of [13]. <p> In the case when one changes k for C the statements of the lemma follow directly from the theorem about the implicit function. In the considered case it is sufficient to apply the transfer principle for the field supplied with a real structure, c.f. [3], see <ref> [1] </ref>. The lemma is proved. Now set V 0 = p 1 (fL 0 6= 0g) ae W 0 where p is the projection from Lemma 2 and y = x u for some u 2 A.

Reference-contexts: The multiplicity (x; V s ) of the point x of the variety V s is defined by the formula (x; V s ) = min f1 + deg V s #V s " Lg: This formula can be explained in the following way, c.f. <ref> [12] </ref>. By its initial meaning the multiplicity (x; V s ) is equal to to the number of points infinitely close to x of the intersection of a generic linear subspace ~ L, dim ~ L = s, which is infinitely close to the point x.

Reference-contexts: After that we can apply the "transfer principle", see [1], and reduce everything to the case of the field of real numbers. For this field we have a developed theory. The result from [14] is crucial which in its turn is based on the result of <ref> [13] </ref>. It should be emphasized that this paper can not appear until two principle steps were made in [3] and [5]. In [3] the problem of the computation of dimension was solved for the case of projective varieties.
