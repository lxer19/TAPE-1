Abstract: A major challenge for the design of multiservice networks with quality of service guarantees is an efficient implementation of a bounded delay service, that is, a service that guarantees maximum end-to-end delays for every packet from a single traffic stream. A crucial component of a bounded delay service is the packet multiplexing technique employed at network switches that must keep the variable statistical multiplexing delays below a predetermined threshold. To achieve a high utilization of network resources, the multiplexing technique must be sufficiently sophisticated to support a variable set of delay bounds for a large number of traffic streams. On the other hand, since multiplexing of packets is to be performed at the data rate of the network links, the complexity of the multiplexer should be strictly limited. A novel packet multiplexing technique, called Rotating Priority Queues (RPQ), is presented which exploits the tradeoff between efficiency, i.e., the ability to support many connections with delay bounds, and low complexity. The operations required by the RPQ multiplexer are similar to those of the simple, but inefficient, Static Priority (SP) multiplexer. The efficiency of RPQ can be made arbitrarily close to the highly efficient, yet complex, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) multiplexer. Exact expressions for the worst case delays in an RPQ multiplexer are derived and compared to expressions for an EDF multiplexer. fl This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NCR-9309224.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we only consider a single multiplexer at an arbitrary network switch. Our results can be applied to routes which include multiple multiplexers by either considering the distortion of the packet stream at each multiplexer as in <ref> [5, 18] </ref>, or by providing a holding mechanisms at each switch as shown in [22, 26]. Next we provide a description of packet multiplexers for networks with a bounded delay service.

Reference-contexts: However, since bandwidth assignment to connections is based on the peak rate of traffic both multiplexers have a low efficiency. Additionally, since delay bounds are tied to the frame size, Stop-and-Go as well as HRR have limited flexibility for assigning different delay bounds to connections. Fair Queueing (FQ) <ref> [6] </ref> employs a round-robin strategy for selecting packets for transmission. <p> Since in FQ the maximum delay of a packet from a connection is proportional to the traffic generated by this connection, FQ has limited flexibility for assigning delay bounds to connections, in particular, for connections with low bandwidth but stringent delay requirements. The Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) multiplexer <ref> [6, 18] </ref> is an extension of FQ where the delay bound of a connection can be derived from weights that are assigned during connection establishment. Parekh has derived schedulability conditions for WFQ in [18]. <p> Using a fluid flow traffic approximation, Cruz has shown necessary and sufficient conditions [4].

Reference-contexts: The first packet in the highest-priority FIFO queue is selected for transmission. Due to the implementation with FIFO queues, the complexity of SP multiplexing is low. However, the efficiency achieved by SP multiplexing is significantly inferior to EDF multiplexing <ref> [15] </ref>. Also, since SP multiplexers can enforce only one delay bound at each priority level, the flexibility in providing variable delay bounds is limited by the number of priority levels. <p> We present the exact schedulability conditions for RPQ multiplexers; hence, we can accurately provide the delay bounds obtained with RPQ multiplexing. By comparing the schedulability conditions of RPQ with those of EDF and SP multiplexers <ref> [15] </ref> we can precisely compare the efficiency of these multiplexers. We show that RPQ approximates the efficiency of EDF to a very high degree even for large values of the rotation interval. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. <p> In Section 2 we discuss previous work on multiplexing techniques for networks with bounded delay services. In Section 3 we discuss a general traffic and multiplexer model. In Section 4 we present the schedulability conditions of EDF multiplexers as derived in <ref> [15] </ref>. In Section 5 we present the novel RPQ packet multiplexer, and prove its necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions. In 1 Preemptive EDF scheduling is optimal in respect to efficiency. <p> Ferrari and Verma show sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF multiplexers in [8]. Necessary and sufficient conditions for EDF are derived in [29] for a particular policing algorithm, and in <ref> [15] </ref> for general policing methods.

We assume that the connections are ordered so that i &lt; j whenever d i &lt; d j . <p> For the efficiency comparison, we use necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for all considered multiplexers. The conditions are obtained from Theorem 1 for EDF multiplexing, from <ref> [15] </ref> for SP multiplexing, and from Theorem 2 for RPQ multiplexing. For the sake of the presentation, we show the efficiency comparison for groups of connections rather than for individual connections.

However, RPQ multiplexing can guarantee that no packet exceeds a given delay bound. We discuss the operations of an RPQ multiplexer in the next subsection.

Reference-contexts: The performance of a packet multiplexer in providing bounded delay services can be determined by the degree to which it satisfies the following requirements <ref> [26] </ref>: * Efficiency: An efficient use of network resources such as link bandwidth can only be achieved if the packet multiplexers can support bounded delays for a large number of connections. * Flexibility: A packet multiplexer must be sufficiently flexible to satisfy a diverse set of delay requirements. <p> RPQ can be considered a hybrid of the well-known Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Static Priority (SP) packet multiplexers, both of which have been considered for bounded delay services <ref> [8, 26] </ref>. <p> Ferrari and Verma show sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF multiplexers in [8]. Necessary and sufficient conditions for EDF are derived in [29] for a particular policing algorithm, and in [15] for general policing methods. The Rate-Controlled Static-Priority multiplexer (RCSP) <ref> [26, 27] </ref> is based on fixed priorities for each connection. Static priority multiplexers can be implemented with low complexity, however, their efficiency is significantly lower than that of EDF multiplexers [15]. Zhang proves sufficient schedulability conditions for static priority multiplexers in [26, 27]. <p> The Rate-Controlled Static-Priority multiplexer (RCSP) <ref> [26, 27] </ref> is based on fixed priorities for each connection. Static priority multiplexers can be implemented with low complexity, however, their efficiency is significantly lower than that of EDF multiplexers [15]. Zhang proves sufficient schedulability conditions for static priority multiplexers in [26, 27]. Using a fluid flow traffic approximation, Cruz has shown necessary and sufficient conditions [4]. For a general class of policing functions, necessary and sufficient conditions are proven in [15]. <p> Our results can be applied to routes which include multiple multiplexers by either considering the distortion of the packet stream at each multiplexer as in [5, 18], or by providing a holding mechanisms at each switch as shown in <ref> [22, 26] </ref>. Next we provide a description of packet multiplexers for networks with a bounded delay service. In Subsection 3.1 we present a general traffic characterization of packet arrivals from a rate-controlled traffic source at a multiplexer.

Reference-contexts: Using a fluid flow traffic approximation, Cruz has shown necessary and sufficient conditions [4]. For a general class of policing functions, necessary and sufficient conditions are proven in [15]. Several multiplexing techniques can provide throughput guarantees, e.g., Fair Queueing [6], Virtual Clock <ref> [28] </ref>, FIFO+ [3]; however, since schedulability conditions are not available for these multiplexers, delay bound guarantees cannot be directly obtained. 3 3 Packet Multiplexers for Bounded Delay Services We consider connection-oriented packet-switching networks with arbitrary topologies.

Reference-contexts: Jitter-EDD [22] extends Delay-EDD by a holding mechanism for packets and can also provide bounds on network delay variations, i.e., the delay jitter. Ferrari and Verma show sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF multiplexers in [8]. Necessary and sufficient conditions for EDF are derived in <ref> [29] </ref> for a particular policing algorithm, and in [15] for general policing methods. The Rate-Controlled Static-Priority multiplexer (RCSP) [26, 27] is based on fixed priorities for each connection. Static priority multiplexers can be implemented with low complexity, however, their efficiency is significantly lower than that of EDF multiplexers [15].
