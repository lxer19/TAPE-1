Abstract: In certain signal processing applications it is required to compute the null space of a matrix whose rows are samples of a signal with p components. The usual tool for doing this is the singular value decomposition. However, the singular value decomposition has the drawback that it requires O(p 3 ) operations to recompute when a new sample arrives. In this paper, we show that a different decomposition, called the URV, decomposition is equally effective in exhibiting the null space and can be updated in O(p 2 ) time. The updating technique can be run on a linear array of p processors in O(p) time.

Reference-contexts: Parallelization. We have seen that the algorithm can be implemented on a linear array of p processors so that it runs in order p time. On the other hand, the singular value decomposition requires p 2 processors to achieve the same updating time. Numerical Results. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the algorithm has been used with the music algorithm to estimate directions of arrival from simulated data. The algorithm performs well, estimating the rank correctly and providing a sufficiently accurate error subspace to obtain the directions of arrival. Availability.

Reference-contexts: The initial cost of computing a singular value decomposition would not be an objection, if the decomposition could be cheaply updated; however, all known updating schemes require on the order of p 3 operations (e.g., see <ref> [2] </ref>). Recently, abridged updating schemes that produce an approximate singular value decomposition have been proposed [7]. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not yet been demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: The difficulties in working with the singular value decomposition have sparked an interest in rank revealing QR decompositions, which decompose the matrix into the product of an orthogonal matrix, an upper triangular matrix, and a permutation matrix in such a way that the effective rank of the matrix is obvious <ref> [3] </ref>. However, a QR decomposition | even a rank-revealing one | does not provide an explicit basis for the error space.

Since treatments of plane rotations are widely available (e.g., see <ref> [4] </ref>), we will not go into the numerical details here. Instead we will sketch the few basic facts needed to understand the updating algorithm and introduce some conventions for describing reductions based on plane rotations. plane rotation.

Reference-contexts: The effect of this is to polish the approximation to the error space. Whether the refinement is worth its cost will have to be determined experimentally. Preliminary runs indicate that the refined version is preferable to the unrefined version when it is used with the music algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. 5. Updating a URV Factorization In this section we will show how to update a rank revealing URV decomposition of A when a row z H is appended. Specifically we will suppose that A has the URV decomposition (2.2), where V is known.

Reference-contexts: This 8 Subspace Tracking ! w w =) ! w w 0 ! w =) 0 1 problem has been extensively studied under the rubric of condition estimation (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a survey), and there exist reliable algorithms that, given a triangular matrix R, produce a vector w of norm one such that with b = Rw we have kbk ~ = inf (R): (4:1) The algorithms generally require a single solution of a triangular system whose matrix is R <p> The crux of the matter is the reliability of the condition estimator that produces the approximate null vector in (4.1). Although counterexamples exist for most condition estimators, a wealth of experiments and experience has shown them to be very reliable in real-life applications <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Many problems in digital signal processing require the computation of an approximate null space of an n fip matrix A whose rows represent samples of a signal (see <ref> [9] </ref> for examples and references). Specifically, we must find an orthogonal matrix V = (V 1 V 2 ) such that 1. AV 1 has no small singular values. 2. AV 2 is small.
