Abstract: We introduce a stable multiple access protocol for broadcast channels shared by bursty stations, which we call CARMA-NTQ (for collision avoidance and resolution multiple access with non-persistence and transmission queues). Like previous efficient MAC protocols based on tree-splitting algorithms (e.g., DQRAP), CARMA-NTQ maintains a distributed queue for the transmission of data packets and a stack for the transmission of control packets used in collision resolution. However, CARMA-NTQ does not require the mini-slots commonly used in protocols based on collision resolution. CARMA-NTQ dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a queue-transmission period. The queue-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the distributed transmission queue by successfully completing a collision-resolution round in a previous contention period. During the contention period, stations with packets to send compete for the right to be added to the data-transmission queue using a deterministic first-success tree-splitting algorithm, so that a new station is added to the transmission queue. A lower bound is derived for the average throughput achieved with CARMA-NTQ as a function of the size of the transmission queue and the number of queue-addition requests that need to be resolved. This bound is based on the upper bound on the average number of collision resolution steps needed to resolve a given number of queue-add requests.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the stations' physical layer adhere to IEEE 802.11 specifications [16]. Handling hidden terminals in CARMA-NTQ is more difficult than in other MAC protocols based on collision avoidance (e.g., MACAW <ref> [1] </ref>, FAMA [6], MACA [10]) because all stations whose transmissions can impact one another must agree on the same state of the channel and the transmission queue, rather than just agreeing on allowing a given sender to transmit a packet without interference.

Reference-contexts: Fullmer and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [7] </ref> have demonstrated sufficient conditions for MAC protocols based on RTS/CTS exchanges to eliminate unwanted collisions due to hidden terminals. <p> For the case of MAC protocols that use carrier sensing, a CTS must be longer than the length of an RTS, plus a maximum round-trip time and processing delays (including radio turn-around times). The net effect of the CTS length suggested in <ref> [7] </ref> is that of a single-channel, receiver-based busy tone that forces hidden sources 10 to back off after they are forced to listen to at least part of the CTS sent by a receiver that has accepted the RTS from a given sender.

Reference-contexts: As long as a station maintains its position in a transmission queue, it transmits packets without collisions. Variants of this basic strategy can be designed using different types of contention-based MAC protocols like ALOHA or CSMA to transmit RTS packets into the channel. We have recently shown <ref> [9] </ref> that collision resolution when applied to the RTS/CTS handshake used in many MAC protocols can improve the throughput of the system substantially. In this paper we describe and analyze a new channel access protocol that combines distributed queues and RTS/CTS handshakes with collision resolution.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the stations' physical layer adhere to IEEE 802.11 specifications [16]. Handling hidden terminals in CARMA-NTQ is more difficult than in other MAC protocols based on collision avoidance (e.g., MACAW [1], FAMA [6], MACA <ref> [10] </ref>) because all stations whose transmissions can impact one another must agree on the same state of the channel and the transmission queue, rather than just agreeing on allowing a given sender to transmit a packet without interference.

Reference-contexts: We call the resulting protocol "Collision Avoidance and Resolution Multiple Access" protocol with non-persistence and transmission queues (CARMA-NTQ).

Like GAMA [15], CARMA-NTQ builds a dynamically-sized cycle that grows and shrinks depending upon traffic demand. Each cycle consists of a contention period and a queue-transmission period during which one or more stations transmit data packets without collision.

Reference-contexts: Using these bounds, Section 4 provides a lower bound on the average throughput achieved by CARMA-NTQ using the model first used by Kleinrock and Tobagi <ref> [12] </ref> for CSMA. The average throughput obtained in CARMA-NTQ is described as a function of the size of the transmission queue and the number of stations that request to be added in the queue in a contention interval. <p> other station; (b) the channel introduces no errors, so control-packet collisions are the only source of errors; (c) stations detect such collisions perfectly; (d) two or more transmissions that overlap in time in the channel must all be re-transmitted; (e) a packet propagates to all stations in exactly t seconds <ref> [12] </ref>, and (f) no station failures occur. Because each station is assigned one or zero RTS at any given time, stations in the network are assigned an "RTS" or an "idle," depending on whether or not they have an RTS to send. <p> Notice that m &gt; ff and m fi cannot both be true since fi ff; therefore, we disregard this case. 4. Throughput Analysis The analysis in this section uses the same traffic model used by Kleinrock and Tobagi <ref> [12] </ref> to analyze CSMA protocols. It is assumed that there is large number of stations, each forming a Poisson source of RTSs (both new and retransmitted). The aggregate mean generation rate of RTSs by all stations is RTSs per unit time.

Reference-contexts: However, prior protocols based on data transmission queues and collision resolution require the establishment of time slots or mini-slots for the transmission of control packets [19,21]. The concept of "Group Allocation Multiple Access" (GAMA) was first introduced by Muir and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [15] </ref> to provide performance guarantees in asynchronous MAC protocols. A GAMA protocol dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a queue-transmission period. <p> We call the resulting protocol "Collision Avoidance and Resolution Multiple Access" protocol with non-persistence and transmission queues (CARMA-NTQ). CARMA-NTQ provides dynamic reservations of the channel, together with collision resolution of the reservations requests based on a tree-splitting algorithm [11]. Like GAMA <ref> [15] </ref>, CARMA-NTQ builds a dynamically-sized cycle that grows and shrinks depending upon traffic demand. Each cycle consists of a contention period and a queue-transmission period during which one or more stations transmit data packets without collision.

Reference-contexts: In this section we summarize a simple modification of the basic scheme intended for wireless LANs in which some stations may be hidden from others and where some stations may capture one of multiple RTS that collide. We assume that the stations' physical layer adhere to IEEE 802.11 specifications <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A way to stabilize the system is by increasing the retransmission delays. Several stable MAC protocols have been proposed in the past based on tree-splitting algorithms (e.g., [5,8,14]). Those protocols in which data packets are used to resolve collisions achieve throughput below 0:6 <ref> [20] </ref>. More recent MAC protocols have been proposed that implement collision resolution using either control packets that are much smaller than data packets, or are based on the ability of the transmitter to abort transmission rapidly after detecting collision (e.g., [3,9,11]).
