Abstract: We first present our view of detection and correction of syntactic errors. We then introduce a new correction method, based on heuristic criteria used to decide which correction should be preferred. Weighting of these criteria leads to a flexible and parametrable system, which can adapt itself to the user. A partitioning of the trees based on linguistic criteria: agreement rules, rather than computational criteria is then necessary. We end by proposing extensions to lexical correction and to some syntactic errors. Our aim is an adaptable and user-friendly system capable of automatic correction for some applications.

Reference-contexts: First centered on lexical errors (Courtin, 89), research work has since turned towards syntactic errors. Latter 1 TRILAN : TRaitement Informatique de la LAngue Naturelle (Computational Treatment of Natural Language) developments aim at building a complete system for detection and correction of errors <ref> (Courtin, 91) </ref>, and even to define a more extensive Computer Aided Writing system (Genthial, 92). In this kind of system, we have at our disposal a large number of modules, each with its own linguistic competence (morphology, phonetic, syntax). <p> The first method can be encountered for example in systems which aim to build a logico-semantic interpretation of the input sentence: in these systems, syntactic constraints are almost completely relaxed and parsing is based on semantic information (Granger, 83; Wan, 92). We have therefore built a prototype <ref> (Courtin, 91) </ref> which can detect and correct agreement errors in number, gender and person, in simple French sentences. The most interesting feature of this prototype is not its coverage, which is limited, but the exhaustive design and implementation of all agreement rules of French grammar.
