Reference-contexts: PTSs extracted from feedbacks of different decoders, when compared, reveal the asynchrony if any. The DSM can then take corrective action for instance, by muting the leading stream until the lagging stream catches up <ref> [2] </ref>. We have developed and implemented this feedback technique for media synchronization in our UCSD Multimedia Laboratory. The laboratory hardware environment consists of four 486-based personal computers connected by both Ethernet and FDDI to a multi-gigabyte storage server.

Reference-contexts: We have omitted a detailed description of the feedback techniques themselves and their peformance evaluation in this paper; for an elaborate treatment of these topics, the reader is kindly referred to a companion paper <ref> [3] </ref>. 7 Concluding Remarks MPEG is the emerging standard for multimedia retrieval and playback. It consists of an encoding layer around which is wrapped a system layer. Whereas the encoding layer handles compression and decompression, the system layer handles streaming, continuity, and synchronization.

Reference-contexts: The synchronization can be driven by either one of the media streams serving as the master, or by the DSM. Both of these approaches are elaborated next. 6.1 Synchronization using A Master Stream All of the media streams being decoded and displayed must have exactly one independent master <ref> [4] </ref>. Each of the individual media display units must slave the timing of their operation to the master stream. The master stream may be chosen depending on the application.

Reference-contexts: non-zero delays in real transmission channels, the clocks of DSM and STD may differ (see Figure 6): T DSM T STD = 2 [ max ; min ] (12) where, max and min are bounds on the transmission delay (possibly introduced by the network) between the DSM and the STD <ref> [5] </ref>. If at any time, the STD buffer suffers an underflow, discontinuity in playback may occur. The worst case scenario for buffer underflow is when an earlier pack arrives after minimum delay and a later pack arrives after maximum delay. Suppose that the first pack arrives after a minimum delay.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia services, in which stored media objects are retrieved on demand by end users, are rapidly emerging to be offered on digital communication networks. There are two distinguishing requirements of media playback: intra-media continuity and inter-media synchronization <ref> [6] </ref>. In the emerging international multimedia encoding standard MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group), continuity and synchronization are handled at different layers of the multimedia stream. In this paper, we discuss how they are specified and propose techniques for their implementation within a distributed multimedia environment.

Reference-contexts: In order to understand MPEG synchronization, it is necessary first to familiarize with the encoder's system architecture, without of course going into details of the encoding algorithms themselves. At the time of encoding in MPEG <ref> [7] </ref>, in the first stage, video frames and audio samples are separately encoded, and an independent stream of bytes is output for each media channel. This is shown in step I of Figure 1. Each media stream is then packetized independently (step II).
