Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the classical, educational topics in Formal Languages and Automata Theory is the pumping lemma for regular languages. This lemma is maturely treated in excellent textbooks (e.g. [2, 4, 5, 6]), or in <ref> [1, 7, 8, 9, 10] </ref>. In a concise logical form, the lemma states that if L is regular, then 9k8w 2 L There has been some useful effort in trying to make the lemma easier to understand.

In a concise logical form, the lemma states that if L is regular, then 9k8w 2 L There has been some useful effort in trying to make the lemma easier to understand. <p> Informed reader can recognize that this result follows fairly straightforward from Myhill-Nerode Theorem, a more advanced topic in automata theory <ref> [5] </ref>. Myhill-Nerode Theorem states that if L is regular, then the number of right-invariant equivalence classes induced by L is finite. <p> It is less straight forward with the conventional pumping lemma. Example 3. L = fxx R w j x; w 2 (0 + 1) + g. (This is a stared exercise in Chapter 3 of <ref> [5] </ref>.) Proof. Before getting to the proof, it is important to note that the non-regularity of the above language cannot be proved by the standard pumping lemma, for the following reasons. Let k = 4.

In <ref> [7] </ref>, for example, the lemma is reinterpreted in terms of games, and proofs are interpreted as winning strategies. Beginners, however, may still find it hard to grasp; they may not feel comfortable to apply the lemma to prove that a given language is not regular.
