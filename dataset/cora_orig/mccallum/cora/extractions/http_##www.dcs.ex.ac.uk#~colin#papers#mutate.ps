Abstract: What is the meaning of the phrase "the gene is the unit of selection"?? Many evolutionists, including Benzer [Ben57], Dawkins [Daw82] and Mayr have explored the diverse meanings of this pregnant phrase. Dawkins gives a particularly careful analysis of this, distinguishing the optimon, the "unit for whose benefit mutations may be said to exist", as one aspect of the gene, and analyzing this optimon the active germ-line replicator. An active replicator is one in which different variations in the replicator affect its chance of being copied. A germ-line replicator is one which has the potential of passing its information on an indefinite number of times, e.g. a gamete, contrasted with a dead-end replicator, such as the chromsomes in a mitotic cell. What I would like to explore in my talk are some speculative thoughts about the effects that a mutation at one locus for changed mutation-susceptibility at another locus might have. Such mutations have been discovered experimentally [Rho41]. We may contrast this local phenomenon with other types of mutation-causing mutations such as alleles at a locus which affect the overall mutation rate along the genome [Kim60, CG74] or where different alleles at a locus have apparently identical phenotypic effects except that they have different mutation rates [Rou79]. The main point here though is two-pronged. Firstly there can be effects in evolution which depend qualitatively on probabilistic effects and for which deterministic models are not good qualitative approximations. Secondly natural selection is potentially a very subtle process, and in applying ideas of optimization in biology we must take great care that we are aware of the underlying genetic mechanism.
