Abstract: We study the off-diagonal blocks in the M(atrix) model that are supposed to correspond to open strings stretched between a Dp-brane and a Dp 0 -brane. It is shown that the spectrum, including the quantum numbers, of the zero modes in the off-diagonal blocks can be determined from the index theorem and unbroken supersymmetry, and indeed reproduces string theory predictions for p-p 0 strings. Previously the matrix description of a longitudinal fivebrane needed to introduce extra degrees of freedom corresponding to 0-4 strings by hand. We show that they are naturally associated with the off-diagonal zero modes, and the supersymmetry transformation laws and low energy effective action postulated for them are now derivable from the M(atrix) theory.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction D (irichlet)-branes have many faces. In string theory, they arise as nonperturbative dynamic objects, allowing strings to end on them and carrying R (amond)-R (amond) charge <ref> [1] </ref>. In the conformal field theory formulation, a Dp-brane is a p-dimensional hyperplane in target space on which strings satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions [2].

In the low energy field theory limit (supergravity), it appears as a soliton-like background with nontrivial R-R antisymmetric tensor field, solving classical equations of motion (see a recent review [3] and references therein).

The low energy dynamics of parallel D-branes, due to strings stretched between them, can be described by a dimensionally reduced supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on their world volume [4], which happens to describe a quantum space in the sense of non-commutative geometry [5].

Thus, in M (atrix) theory, everything else appears as a collective (bound) state of D0-branes. In particular, a multiple parallel D-brane background is realized as a block-diagonal matrix <ref> [6] </ref>, each block represented by a topologically nontrivial gauge field configuration [7, 8] on a D-brane volume. In this paper we study the dynamics of D-branes by introducing and examining off-diagonal blocks, that are supposed to correspond to strings stretched between D-branes. <p> and bosonic modes in M (atrix) theory. (Though it is amusing to note that in M (atrix) theory, the bosonic off-diagonal blocks that are supposed to correspond to 0-4 strings are SO (4) vectors!) 3 3 M (atrix) Description of D-Brane Configurations The action of the M (atrix) model is <ref> [6] </ref> S = dtT r ( 4 1 [X ; ]); (1) where ; - = 0; 1; ; 9, F - = [X ; X -] and X 0 = iD 0 = i ( @ @t + A 0 ). <p> There are two ways to realize this physical setting in the M (atrix) theory. Take the D2-brane as an example. One way is to set X 1 = R 1 P , X 2 = R 2 Q, where [P; Q] = i2=N <ref> [6] </ref>. P and Q can in turn be realized as P = i (2=N ) @ @ and Q = through an angle parameter 2 [0; 2).
