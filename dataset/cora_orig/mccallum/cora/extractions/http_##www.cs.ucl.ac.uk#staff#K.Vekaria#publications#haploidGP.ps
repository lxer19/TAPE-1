Abstract: This paper presents a new crossover operator for genetic programming dominance crossover. Dominance crossover is similar to the use of dominance in nature. In nature, dominance is used as a genotype to phenotype mapping when an organism carries pairs (or more than one) chromosome, but here we use dominance on a haploid structure. The haploid form contains all the information relevant to the problem, and is the structure that is widely used in evolutionary algorithms. Dominance crossover is used as a way of retaining and promoting successful genes (those which increased the individuals fitness in the current generation) into the next generation. Current crossover operators fail to exploit knowledge acquired in previous generations and rely highly on selection pressures. Dominance crossover in theory allows this exploitation to occur during crossover but we highlight a problem with the application of dominance crossover with genetic programming.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Dawkins model of evolution is based on the gene. He presents his theory of the gene as the fundamental unit of natural selection <ref> [Dawk89] </ref>. Chromosomes have a life span of one generation but a genetic unit lasts for many generations, thus natural selection favours the genetic unit. Genetic material in complex organisms is often presented using diploid chromosomes.

Reference-contexts: b y d e w v u t w v f g s r s r (c) and (y) are chosen for crossover (y) has a greater dominance value than (c) Experiments and Results Both SNDC and STDC were applied to the symbolic regression, lawnmower and Santa Fe Trail problems <ref> [Fras94] </ref>. The following properties were found for SNDC: The population converged too ear ly. Sometimes it failed to find a solution. This is probably because trees were not allowed to grow. The following properties were found for STDC: The trees bloated to the maximum size. <p> If this study proves the success of selective crossover in GA, it will also prove that the current GP structure is unable to exploit advance operators.

Reference-contexts: In addition dominance is used to exploit knowledge acquired in previous generations. Diploidy and Dominance in GAs Hollstien (1971) (in [Gold89]), <ref> [GoSm87] </ref> and most recently [HaEi97] have modelled diploidy or polyploidy and dominance in genetic algorithms. Hollstiens (1971) work done on diploidy and dominance contained diploid genotypes. Each individual in the population carried a pair of chromosomes. <p> Dominance shift (change) is handled like the mutation operator i.e. mapping a 2 to a 1 or vice versa. His scheme maintained better population diversity than his haploid simulations, but no improvement in average or ultimate performance. Goldberg and Smith <ref> [GoSm87] </ref> concentrated on the role of dominance and diploidy as abeyance structures (shielding information that may be useful when situations change). They compared a haploid GA with a diploid GA, which used fixed dominance map (1's dominate 0's) on a nonstationary knapsack problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition dominance is used to exploit knowledge acquired in previous generations. Diploidy and Dominance in GAs Hollstien (1971) (in [Gold89]), [GoSm87] and most recently <ref> [HaEi97] </ref> have modelled diploidy or polyploidy and dominance in genetic algorithms. Hollstiens (1971) work done on diploidy and dominance contained diploid genotypes. Each individual in the population carried a pair of chromosomes. <p> This improvement was due to the fact that the triallelic scheme allowed dominance to evolve at each locus; hence the population was able to adapt more quickly to the change. Hadad and Eick <ref> [HaEi97] </ref> showed that polyploidy (two or more sets of chromosomes) is beneficial for adapting to changing environment. They introduced an extra vector, the crossover control vector, which dictates where a chromosome can split to create gametes. These gametes are later combined to form another individual (similar to natural reproduction).

Reference-contexts: Here we use dominance, during crossover, to exploit knowledge acquired in previous generations to promote genes onto the next generation. Dominance Crossover in GP The idea for dominance crossover was originally proposed in [VeCl97] and is described here in more depth. Genetic programming <ref> [Koza92] </ref> traditionally uses a haploid chromosome: the haploid form contains all the information relevant to the problem and the genes do not have associated dominance values. With dominance crossover the parse tree contains the normal defined function and terminal sets.

Reference-contexts: When building the body the genes in one set compete with those in the other set. Genes that are expressed in the phenotype of an organism are dominant and those that are not are recessive. The relationship between a dominant and recessive gene is not a simple binary relationship <ref> [Merr94] </ref>: some genes that have been known to be dominant have become more recessive in successive generations and vice versa. These dominance characteristics have evolved over generations and have been promoted via natural selection.

Reference-contexts: Much work (see next section) has been done to model diploidy and dominance in GA but dominance has not been used as an evolving factor for crossover on haploid structures. Assuming a correlation between program fitness and subtree fitness, an alternative method of crossover Dominance Crossover was proposed <ref> [VeCl97] </ref> for GP. Dominance crossover is not what happens in nature although it extracts the same characteristics as used in nature. Dominance is used here during crossover in haploid structures rather than a genotype to phenotype mapping, it evolves over successive generations and these characteristics are promoted via selection pressures. <p> The motivation behind the use of dominance with diploidy was as abeyance structures for changing environments. Here we use dominance, during crossover, to exploit knowledge acquired in previous generations to promote genes onto the next generation. Dominance Crossover in GP The idea for dominance crossover was originally proposed in <ref> [VeCl97] </ref> and is described here in more depth. Genetic programming [Koza92] traditionally uses a haploid chromosome: the haploid form contains all the information relevant to the problem and the genes do not have associated dominance values. With dominance crossover the parse tree contains the normal defined function and terminal sets.
