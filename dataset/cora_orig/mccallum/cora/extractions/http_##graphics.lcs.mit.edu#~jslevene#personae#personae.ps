Reference-contexts: Rather than radically changing a users web experience, our aim has been to add new functions without substantially altering a users ordinary interaction <ref> (as in Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996) </ref>. In designing Personae agents, we followed four major guidelines: 1. Web agents should act as advisors and not as assistants. Assistantstyle agents always perform tasks for the user, creating a relationship where an agents success creates dependency. <p> In other words, the user should communicate principally and directly with the web (using HTTP and HTML) rather than with agents. This guideline ensures that the true nature of the web is not abstracted out so as to simplify interaction and create user-agent dependency <ref> (Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996) </ref>. 3. Agents should act both proactively and reactively, maintaining a dialogue with the user. The agents should offer 11 relevant information when it is appropriate, and the user should be able to request for an agents assistance at any time. <p> The agents should offer 11 relevant information when it is appropriate, and the user should be able to request for an agents assistance at any time. Combining both these qualities creates a more interactive and personal experience <ref> (Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996) </ref>. 4. Agents should not take control from the user. Although agents may offer advice, the user must remain in charge. This builds trust, confidence, and reliability in the user-agent relationship and reduces intimidation (Norman 1994). <p> It simply performs its task and then terminates. For example, WBI contains an autonomous module which augments the knowledge a user has accrued by finding new web pages which are related to a previously viewed one <ref> (Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996 - See Figure 6) </ref>. 4.3 Using WBI modules WBI contains a central loop that arbitrates among possible generators to determine which handles the request from the browser. It then dynamically constructs a network composed of monitors and editors to observe and alter the incoming response. <p> For example, a generator can stipulate that it is invoked only when the current request is for a fake document on a nonexisting server such as http://_wbi/usermodel/query as in Figure 6 <ref> (Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996) </ref>. WBI uses its monitors to build a user model (which stores a users past history) and uses its generators and editors to predict a users interests and needs.

Reference-contexts: When the mind is focused on one piece of information, it jumps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain <ref> (Bush 1945) </ref>. With the web, hypertext allows one particular page to contain multiple links to other pages. A user merely clicks on one of these hyperlinks and is easily transported to the related page. This allows for a trail to be forged through the vast information space of the web. <p> The trail history of a Persona captures some of the thought and understanding which went into a particular searching or browsing session of the author and intends to communicate this to a viewer <ref> (Bush 1945) </ref>. As one browses the web, one does not usually jump randomly from one page anywhere on the web to another unrelated page. A browsing session (a sequence of web pages) is usually very logical, and viewing the browsing session of another user can be very informative.

Reference-contexts: For example, the agent was not designed so that all interaction would be based on explicit conversations with the agent rather than with the web directly <ref> (as in Etzioni & Weld 1994) </ref>. Rather than radically changing a users web experience, our aim has been to add new functions without substantially altering a users ordinary interaction (as in Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996). In designing Personae agents, we followed four major guidelines: 1.

Reference-contexts: Combining both these qualities creates a more interactive and personal experience (Barrett, Maglio & Kellem 1996). 4. Agents should not take control from the user. Although agents may offer advice, the user must remain in charge. This builds trust, confidence, and reliability in the user-agent relationship and reduces intimidation <ref> (Norman 1994) </ref>. With these user-interface guidelines in mind, I now turn to the details of the implementation of Personae. 4. The implementation of Personae 4.1 The WBI system I implemented Personae as an extension to Barrett, Maglio and Kellems existing Web Browser Intelligence (WBI) system.

Reference-contexts: Web agents should act as advisors and not as assistants. Assistantstyle agents always perform tasks for the user, creating a relationship where an agents success creates dependency. Advisory-style agents, on the other hand, build a user relationship with the explicit goal of educating the individual <ref> (Selker 1994) </ref>. 2. In keeping with the first guideline, web agents should maintain the standard user interface of the web. In other words, the user should communicate principally and directly with the web (using HTTP and HTML) rather than with agents.
