Title: PAVING THE ROAD TO NETWORK SECURITY OR THE VALUE OF SMALL COBBLESTONES  
Author: Hilarie Orman Sean O'Malley Richard Schroeppel David Schwartz 
Address: Tucson, Arizona  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Arizona  
Abstract: Software subsystems that implement cryptographic security features can be built from small modules using uniform interfaces. The methods demonstrated in this paper illustrate how configuration flexibility can be achieved and how complex services can be constructed, all using the same building block modules. These allow the configuration process to be independent of algorithm details, while the algorithms used in the subsystem are obvious. 1

Reference-contexts: The simple protocols are, however, appropriate for constructing protocols that are defined by external standards. Our building blocks concept can support the implementation of cleanly layered protocols such as NLSP <ref> [3] </ref>. The sample configurations from the Modes of Operation section are in the spirit of such a protocol. They provide privacy and integrity via composition of DES and MD5.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the ways that building blocks can be configured, the next sections show how the cryptographic enhancements can be added to a standard local area network protocol graph, one that has optimizations that bypass the IP layer for messages that are destined for local delivery.
