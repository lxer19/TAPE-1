Abstract: Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) local-area networks based on the optical passive-star coupler have traditionally been classified as being either single-hop or multihop. A single-hop network provides a direct connection between the source and the destination of a packet during the packet transfer duration, but may require some amount of coordination between the nodes which may involve tuning of the transmitters or receivers at each node. Since the time required to tune a tunable optical transmitter or receiver may be high, a single-hop network may incur significant overhead. On the other hand, a typical multihop network requires little or no tuning, but a packet may traverse a number of intermediate nodes between the source and destination nodes. Each hop incurs additional queuing delays at each node and also increases the overall load on each link and on the network. In this paper, we propose a new class of multiconfiguration multihop protocols (MMPs) which use tunable transmitters and receivers to cycle through a number of configurations which together make up a multihop logical topology. This class of protocols offers a trade-off between the tuning required in a single-hop network and the number of hops required in a multihop network. We present a generalized framework for comparing the proposed protocols with existing single-hop and multihop protocols, and we show that these protocols may offer significant performance gains for systems with high tuning delays and a limited number of transmitters and receivers at each node.

Reference-contexts: The practicality of this approach is limited by the high cost of optical transmitters and receivers. 2. Channel sharing: The second method for providing connectivity in a WDM PSC network is to reduce the number of channels in the network, and allow channel sharing <ref> [1] </ref> [2]. By limiting the number of channels in this manner, multiple transmitters and receivers from different nodes can be made to occupy the same channel, thus creating more direct connections between nodes. As an example, consider a network with N nodes and one transceiver pair per node.

Another extension to this work is to introduce channel sharing. With channel sharing, the number of channels, w, is less than the number of stations. In <ref> [2] </ref>, it has been shown that channel sharing increases the connectivity of the network by using fewer channels. The study assumed a single fixed transmitter and a single fixed receiver per node.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a station cannot obtain information regarding each of the other stations' traffic demands without tuning to each channel. Packet switching may be provided in a static manner in a single-hop network by using time-division multiplexing (TDM) <ref> [5] </ref> [6]. In the static WDM/TDM approach, time on each channel is divided into a number of frames, with each frame subdivided into slots. Nodes are equipped with a fixed transmitter and a tunable receiver (FT-TR), however such protocols may be easily modified to accommodate a tunable-transmitter, fixed-receiver system (TT-FR).

The dynamic single-hop approach requires more tuning and overhead, but is able to accommodate varying traffic patterns. <p> In either case, some amount of coordination is required. This coordination may be provided either through a separate control channel, or through the use of in-band signaling over the data channels (see, for example, <ref> [10] </ref>). The case in which the logical topology changes infrequently is a straightforward extension of the static protocol. It may be implemented by having each station accumulate traffic information over a period of time, and then having the stations exchange this information at predetermined intervals.

Reference-contexts: In previous works, the logical topology has been created by fixing each transmitter and each receiver to an appropriate channel <ref> [11] </ref>. In the case of a single transmitter and a single receiver per node, the only possible fully-connected topology would be a ring. <p> In <ref> [11] </ref>, the problem of finding an optimal logical topology for a given traffic matrix and a given physical topology is addressed. However, in our case, we are not constrained by a physical topology, nor is the logical topology constrained by the number of transmitters or receivers at each node. <p> We can then modify the problem statement in <ref> [11] </ref> to accommodate networks in which multiple configuration are employed to create a logical topology. <p> per node Objective: Find a logical topology and corresponding configurations which minimize the average packet delay Design variables: Logical topology c: Number of configurations K: Duration of each configuration Composition of each configuration (transmitter and receiver tuning schedule) Such topological optimization problems have been shown to be hard to solve <ref> [11] </ref>. In this work, we will simplify the problem by assuming that the traffic matrix is uniform, and that each node is equipped with one fixed transmitter and one tunable receiver (FT-TR). Since the traffic matrix is uniform, we will consider only regular logical topologies.

Reference-contexts: Since the traffic matrix is uniform, we will consider only regular logical topologies. One class of regular logical topologies which is scalable and able to accommodate an arbitrary nodal degree is GEMNET <ref> [14] </ref>. GEMNET also compares favorably to other classes of topologies in terms of average hop distance. 3.4 Configuration Design Once a logical topology is selected, another issue to consider is how to partition the logical topology into individual configurations, and how long the network should remain in any given configuration. <p> An (x; y; z) GEMNET has x columns, y rows, and a nodal degree of z (see Fig. 9 for an illustrative example). We select one or two columns for the GEMNETs since these configurations yield the lowest average hop distances <ref> [14] </ref>. The details of each logical topology are given in Table 1. In these examples, we also assume that the propagation delay is negligible, since we are considering a local-area network environment. The analytical results are verified through simulation.

Reference-contexts: The queueing model can then be solved to find the queuing delay, D i , for each individual link using the generalized TDM model from <ref> [15] </ref>. The queueing delays, D i , consist of three components. The first is the time required for an arriving packet to synchronize to the appropriate configuration.
