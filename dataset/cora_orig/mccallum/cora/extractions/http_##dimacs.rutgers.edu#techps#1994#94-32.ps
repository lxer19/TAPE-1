Reference-contexts: Berge and Duchet studied kernels and kernel solvability (solvability), and conjectured that kernel solvability is equivalent with perfectness. More precisely, the following two conjectures were stated in <ref> [3] </ref>: Conjecture 1. Perfect graphs are kernel solvable. Conjecture 2. Kernel solvable graphs are perfect. The first conjecture was proved for some special cases, including Gallai graphs in [16], line graphs in [17], and complements of strongly perfect graphs in [5].

Based on this equivalence, in Section 6, we show that perfectness of a graph G is equivalent with the g-stability of the associated family K G of coalitions. The connection between the two types of stability enables us to prove Theorems 1 and 2. <p> The main technical result of this section, Lemma 5 is essentially equivalent with a result of <ref> [6, 10] </ref> about the integrality of the fractional vertex packing polytope.

Reference-contexts: It was proved in <ref> [15] </ref> that if G is perfect then every blow-up G 0 of it is perfect, too. Thus, according to Theorem 1, any blow-up G 0 of a perfect graph G is kernel solvable. <p> Since G 0 is perfect, it contains a stable set S W intersecting all maximum weight cliques of G 0 (with respect to the weights z v , v 2 W , see <ref> [15] </ref>). <p> To show that G is perfect it is enough to show that in any induced subgraph G 0 = (W; E 0 ) of G induced by - 10 - W V there is a stable set S W which intersects all maximum cliques of G 0 (see <ref> [15] </ref>). <p> Since G 0 is perfect, there exists in this case a stable set S 0 W which intersects all maximum weight cliques of G 0 (see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref>), and thus for any maximal stable set S of G for which S " W = S 0 , S 2 D i implies S " i " W 6= ;. Let v 2 S " i " W be an arbitrary vertex now. <p> Let us assume first that Conjecture 2 holds. Then, by Lemma 6 perfectness and kernel solvability are equivalent, thus Conjecture 4 follows by <ref> [15] </ref>. Let us assume now Conjecture 4 to be true, and let us consider a non perfect graph G. Then its complement, G is also non perfect (see [15]), and thus G has a blow up, G 0 which is not kernel solvable, by Lemma 6. <p> Then, by Lemma 6 perfectness and kernel solvability are equivalent, thus Conjecture 4 follows by <ref> [15] </ref>. Let us assume now Conjecture 4 to be true, and let us consider a non perfect graph G. Then its complement, G is also non perfect (see [15]), and thus G has a blow up, G 0 which is not kernel solvable, by Lemma 6.
