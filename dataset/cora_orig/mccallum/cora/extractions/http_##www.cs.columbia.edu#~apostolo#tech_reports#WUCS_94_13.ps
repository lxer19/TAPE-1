Reference-contexts: It has to take into account the percentage of cells that were discarded although they could have been transmitted, the probability that a legally operating source is restricted, the time it takes to respond to a violating source, and other parameters. Such measures of effectiveness are given in <ref> [3, 6, 39] </ref>. According to the definition of efficiency proposed in [39], the leaky bucket turns out to be the most efficient policing algorithm. 8.

Reference-contexts: Another parameter whose impact on the network performance has been shown to be important through simulations is the mean burst length. While quite a few policing mechanisms have been suggested for policing of the peak rate and the mean rate <ref> [8, 49] </ref>, most policers can impose limits only on the maximum burst length but are unable to police the mean burst length. <p> Pick-up mechanisms must observe a few tens of cells before taking any action, introducing some latency in the mechanism's reaction. A mechanism intended for policing the peak rate is presented in <ref> [8, 26] </ref>. The hardware implementation suggested in [8] is called spacer-controller. <p> Pick-up mechanisms must observe a few tens of cells before taking any action, introducing some latency in the mechanism's reaction. A mechanism intended for policing the peak rate is presented in [8, 26]. The hardware implementation suggested in <ref> [8] </ref> is called spacer-controller. The basic idea of this mechanism is to store the incoming traffic and re-transmit it in such a way that the traffic pattern is as close as possible to the initial structure of the source in terms of the distance between consecutive cells.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the tagging approach cannot be used in a framework supporting priorities, since tagged traffic would interfere with conforming low priority traffic. Finally, the decision of where to place the policer will affect the traffic expected at the entrance to the policer. CCITT's recommendation I.371 <ref> [9] </ref> suggests that connections be monitored and controlled in terms of offered load, by a mechanism called the usage parameter control (UPC) mechanism at the user-network interface (UNI) at the T B reference point, and by a mechanism called the network parameter control (NPC) at the network-node interface (NNI) point.

Reference-contexts: This recommendation points out that a certain CDV tolerance between the source and the T B reference point must be specified for the UPC mechanism properly to control the parameters agreed on during negotiation time.

Reference-contexts: The leaky-bucket enforces the mean rate and poses a limit on the maximum burst length. Some problems associated with the leaky bucket along with proposed solutions, can be found in <ref> [21] </ref>. 12 The leaky-bucket and other mechanisms such as window flow control mechanisms are examples of a general category of flow control mechanisms called pick-up mechanisms. Pickup mechanisms consist of a pool of N credits generated according to a rule depending on the mechanism.

Reference-contexts: This property makes the proposed scheme particularly suitable for the purposes of CAC algorithms. An extension of the above scheme, aimed at the provision of different restrictions on the extent of the permissible traffic distortion, according to the distortion the source can tolerate, is proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>. The extension is based on the use of frames with different sizes at the expense of increased hardware complexity. 7.

Reference-contexts: Pick-up mechanisms may have to contain a few tens of credits in order to be transparent to conforming traffic, while accommodating for CDV. According to a heuristic rule given in <ref> [34] </ref>, the leaky bucket policing a connection with a peak emission period T must contain [d =T ] +2 credits, in order for the rejection probability of conforming cells to be very low (say 10 10 ).

Reference-contexts: Policing mechanisms can be combined in parallel or in tandem when multiple parameters must be simultaneously policed <ref> [36] </ref>. For example, policing the peak and the mean rate can be performed by a spacer-controller followed by a leaky-bucket. Also if a stream contains cells with different priorities, two (or more) policing mechanisms can be combined in parallel, one for each sub-stream.

Reference-contexts: It has to take into account the percentage of cells that were discarded although they could have been transmitted, the probability that a legally operating source is restricted, the time it takes to respond to a violating source, and other parameters. Such measures of effectiveness are given in <ref> [3, 6, 39] </ref>. According to the definition of efficiency proposed in [39], the leaky bucket turns out to be the most efficient policing algorithm. 8.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is the introduction of a finite measurement interval or an averaging interval over which the parameter is monitored. A typical example of a finite measurement interval can be found in <ref> [40] </ref>. One of the main difficulties with such an approach is determining the 11 length of the measurement interval, which influences both the amount of buffer needed by the policer and also the time required to detect violating traffic. <p> Finally, another use of a shaper can be to shape the traffic of the source at the customer premises, before the policer, so as to make the source traffic conform to the predefined traffic parameters <ref> [40] </ref>. Policing mechanisms can be combined in parallel or in tandem when multiple parameters must be simultaneously policed [36]. For example, policing the peak and the mean rate can be performed by a spacer-controller followed by a leaky-bucket.

Reference-contexts: Each incoming cell takes a credit if available; if not, it is detected as a violating cell. Pick-up mechanisms do not reshape the conforming traffic; thus they do not introduce any extra latency. An extension to the leaky bucket which introduces possible shaping of the traffic was proposed in <ref> [45] </ref>. The proposed mechanism, called buffered leaky bucket, introduces a buffer whose purpose is to store cells if no tokens are currently available. Pick-up mechanisms are very attractive because of their simplicity.
