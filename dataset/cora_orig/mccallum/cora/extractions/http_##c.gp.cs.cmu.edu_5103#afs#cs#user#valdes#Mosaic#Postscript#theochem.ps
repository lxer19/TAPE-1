Abstract: Recently discovered methods have enabled the computerized prediction of the poss i-ble labeled products of a reaction mechanism, given a proposed labeling experiment. Here, we report an extension of these methods for the purpose of generating reaction mechanisms that can explain the observed presence or absence of labeled products. This new capability has been int e-grated into MECHEM, an interactive program for elucidating reaction mechanisms. We demo n-strate the capability by generating a full set of the simpler mechanisms that can account for l a-beling results in the decomposition of formic acid over metal and metal oxide catalysts.

Reference-contexts: Case Study Using the Model Reaction: Formic Acid Decomposition We demonstrate the new capability on the decomposition of formic acid as discussed on p. 89 of a monograph by Ozaki <ref> [1] </ref>. According to Ozaki, formic acid yields CO and H 2 over a ZnO catalyst, which transforms into formate Zn [OC (O)H] 2 by the reaction with HCOOH. <p> MH + MCOOH (1) fi MOH + O=CHM 4.

For example, over a silver cat a-lyst, both HCOOD and DCOOH yield the entire spectrum of hydrogen/deuterium molecules (H 2 D , HD) (see the monograph by Ozaki [1], p. 187, and references therein). <p> by M) the decomposition of formic acid occur s via di f-ferent mechanisms than in the case of metal oxide catalysts <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For predictive and/or discriminative purposes, one determines and/or contrasts the obtainable labeled products, given a contemplated labeling of the starting materials. For explanatory purposes, the experiments have already been carried out, possibly by previous investigators, and the task is to account for the evidence. In a previous article <ref> [4] </ref>, we reported systematic methods for predicting the distribution of l a-beled products and intermediates given a hypothetical mechanism and a proposed labeling e x-periment [4]. These methods were incorporated into MECHEM [5], an interactive aid for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms. <p> In a previous article <ref> [4] </ref>, we reported systematic methods for predicting the distribution of l a-beled products and intermediates given a hypothetical mechanism and a proposed labeling e x-periment [4]. These methods were incorporated into MECHEM [5], an interactive aid for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms. This paper treats the converse problem: Given the results of isotopic labeling experiments, generate all the simpler mechanisms consistent with these results. <p> Two types of qualitative evidence must be accommodated: (i) a set of products and intermediates cannot be formed (i.e., are not observed) or, on the contrary, (ii) must be formed. The adaptation of the originally predictive methods <ref> [4] </ref> to the current goal of expl a-nation involves some technical difficulties, which are resolved below.

Explanation versus Prediction A forthcoming article [4] describes in detail how, given (i) a reaction mechanism, (ii) a labe ling experiment, and (iii) user selections of which steps are reversible, a computer program can predict (i.e., determine) all the labeled variants that the mechanism can possibly form. <p> therefore does not account for isotopic tracing experiments, but this can be done subsequent to MECHEMs output by external means. (3) Currently, the program operates in two modes: (i) given a mechanism, whether input directly by the user or generated by the program itself, predict the positions of l a-bels <ref> [4] </ref>; and (ii) feed the results of isotopic labeling experiments and then generate mechanisms to explain these results. In predictive mode, the user can correct or augment the mechanism with additional steps (e.g., degenerate steps), and also specify which steps are reversible. <p> That is, mechanisms are given the benefit of the doubt with respect to step reversibilities, as explained in detail above. After the mechanisms are reported, the use can then select specific reversibilities at his discretion and reconsider the labeling results while in predi c-tive mode <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: MECHEM found twelve mechanisms of which seven contained these unlikely steps: HCOOH + 2M fi MOH + MCH=O 7 The five remaining mechanisms are listed below. The numbers embedded in the arrows are stoichiometric Horiuti numbers (also known as reaction extents) <ref> [9] </ref>. The five mechanisms are similar in the sense that, in each case, the first two steps serve to form a catalytically active su r face species that is regenerated at step 4. 1.
