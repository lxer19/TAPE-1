Reference: [Briggs] <author> P. Briggs, Nuweb, </author> <title> a simple literate programming tool, </title> <note> Version 0.87, </note> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: The program is presented here with limited use of Knuth's "literate programming style" [Knuth84] of combined documentation and code development, supported by Brigg's Nuweb tool <ref> [Briggs] </ref>. [This presentation currently doesn't fully follow the literate programming style, since the program was developed earlier just as a code file and has simply been quickly repackaged here as a Nuweb file.
