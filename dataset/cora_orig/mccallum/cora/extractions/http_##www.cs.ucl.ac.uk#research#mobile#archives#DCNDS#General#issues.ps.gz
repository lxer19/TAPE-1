Abstract: We describe some of the issues in the design of a new packet switched network protocol. Adaptation to various network technologies along the dimensions of speed, error model, robustness, etc., is a goal for this new protocol. We look at the adaption in size of the packet header to the speed and robustness of the underlying network to allow efficient communication on low-speed wireless networks, for example. We also explore issues in resource reservation and multicast for real-time multimedia, the notion of a network "flow", a hybrid of datagrams and virtual circuits, and suggest common solutions for both mobile and multicast routing. The authors are engaged in the design of a network protocol, NP++, whose goal is flexibility over a wide dynamic range of speeds and varying kinds of hardware switching elements.

We agree that the idea of having packets contain the code that network elements should use to process them is very flexible.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, if it is the processing power of the switches that is the forwarding bottleneck, one could add more fields to the header, as suggested in <ref> [4] </ref>, to decrease the processing time in the switch. This is, in effect, the inverse of header compression. Another example of adapting headers to networks is the use of header implication such as can be done when layering IPv6 over ATM.

Soft-state <ref> [5] </ref>, where timers and refresh messages keep state in place avoiding tear-down messages, has been developed for networks where hard-state is a problem. In large networks, routing tables are usually maintained by dynamic routing protocols. Changing network conditions can cause such protocols to modify the routing table.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of this centralized approach, however, is that since the sender must keep track of every receiver, the number of receivers per-sender is limited. The group broadcast model of multicast, used in Multicast IP <ref> [7] </ref>, builds trees from senders to receivers without the sender necessarily knowing the identities of the receivers. The DVMRP multicast routing protocol for IP, for example, uses flooding and pruning to reach potential receivers on the edges of the network.

Reference-contexts: At a sufficiently high level of abstraction, the address of the mobile host is like a multicast address that is restricted to having only a single receiver. The similarity between Multicast and Mobile IP becomes clear when comparing the latter to the PIM multicast routing protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. In PIM, a rendez-vouz point, RP, acts as a place where senders and receivers in a multicast group can meet. Receivers inform the RP that they want packets sent to the multicast group, and senders send their packets to the RP for further delivery to receivers.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, a virtual circuit is also a network flow. In the Internet, unicast or multicast IP packets from source to destinations have also been termed "flows," especially when these packets contain real-time continuous media like voice and video. In the next-generation IP protocol, IPv6 <ref> [9] </ref>, there is a new field called the Flow Label that provides at least syntactical support for flows in the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Thus, by removing large addresses from packets and assigning small, temporary connection identifiers, header compression can be achieved on a low speed link with soft state that is refreshed by the arrival of address field chunks sent less frequently than the data <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. On a high speed link the small connection identifier may speed up forwarding as no routing lookup is necessary. 3 Network Hardware Architectures Another dimension in which NP++ is designed to be flexible is in its adaptability to various network hardware architectures.

Reference-contexts: The burden on the network by advance reservations could be minimized by having the sender send Path messages in advance infrequently, increasing the frequency as the time of the teleconference approaches <ref> [11] </ref>. The problem with this scheme for RSVP is that the sender must be present and sending Path messages for the receiver to be able to make a reservation; and this may be impractical.

Reference-contexts: Soft-state could be established at a downstream switch, with the larger addresses sent downstream periodically to refresh the state. This can provide a new kind of header compression for links in a path that have relatively low-bandwidth. Our design for IPv6 header compression <ref> [13] </ref>, uses this principle to achieve soft-state-based header compression for UDP/IP.

Reference-contexts: For this to be the case, the new protocol must be able to fragment and reassemble itself in the network when necessary <ref> [15] </ref>. 4 Datagrams and Virtual Circuits This section describes the two dominant ways of designing protocols for packet switched networks: datagrams as in the IP protocol used in the Internet, and virtual circuits as in ATM.

Reference-contexts: For virtual circuits, the routing table is accessed when a connection is established. If all IP addresses were given out systematically such that all addresses in a certain part of the Internet had identical prefixes <ref> [16, 24] </ref>, the number of entries in routing tables would be smaller than today, probably in the hundreds instead of in the tens of thousands. The cost of a routing lookup would thus be significantly reduced and there would be one less advantage of virtual circuits over datagrams. <p> For datagram networks, one bottleneck is the size of routing tables. With CIDR <ref> [16] </ref> a hierarchical structure is imposed on subnet identifiers by assigning subnet identifiers in the same "area" a common prefix. Several routing table entries can thus be collapsed into a single entry consisting of the common prefix.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the scheme easily allows quality of service to be preserved over the hop for real time multimedia, if the ATM network provides the quality needed by the IP flow. 7 Switching at one layer only The Ipsilon flow switching system <ref> [18] </ref> for switching IP packets in an ATM network is similar to the header implication scheme outlined in the previous section, except that the IP header is not removed.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it has been argued that today's ATM cell switches offer the best price/performance for high speed packet switching. On the horizon however are new designs and prototypes for IP routers <ref> [19] </ref> that will provide cost-effective routing of variable-length packets at multi-gigabits per second, where large packets increase the total throughput.

Reference-contexts: With datagrams, however, changes in the routing table causes packets to follow different paths through the network, possibly resulting in changes in service quality. Routing changes are not uncommon in the Internet. A recent study <ref> [20] </ref> shows that the routing instability in the Internet has increased slightly between December 1994 and December 1995. When the network is actually damaged, on the other hand, virtual circuit networks require special mechanisms if connections through the damaged part are to be recreated on paths circumventing the damage.

Reference-contexts: This index is sometimes called a virtual circuit identifier, (VCI), and is placed in each data packet belonging to the connection. In addition, there has to be an end-to-end virtual circuit identifier that uniquely identifies the circuit across all of its hops, as in ST-2 <ref> [26] </ref>. These two identifiers, along with the per-switch identifiers that must be present in order to negotiate the VCI between any two hops, mean that virtual circuit networks need at least three levels of naming.

Reference-contexts: For each packet, a router must determine if the packet needs special treatment and, if it does, the router must access the forwarding parameters for that kind of packet. Current work in the IETF on Controlled Load Service <ref> [28] </ref> is attempting to reduce the amount of forwarding state needed by lumping packets together into classes of packets that are treated in the same way. Such aggregation does not reduce the lookup time, however, since the size of the lookup domain is not decreased. <p> Such aggregation does not reduce the lookup time, however, since the size of the lookup domain is not decreased. Classification of packets is typically done on the basis of addresses, transport protocol, and port numbers. Aggregation of the form discussed in <ref> [28] </ref> reduces the amount of forwarding state by sharing it, but does not help to simplify the procedure of deciding what class a packet belongs to.

Thus, even in the Internet, one may be able to make reservations on behalf of flows. These reservations are not made using classical hard-state based signaling protocols (although they could be).
