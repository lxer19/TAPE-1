Abstract: This paper presents three broad classes of network architecture that support discovery of information sources. Relevant concepts such as query routing and the extraction, propagation, and retrieval of metadata are defined. Based on these concepts, different models of locating and querying relevant information sources are presented. Finally, we estimate several important characteristics of these models and classes as well as their expected scalability.

Reference-contexts: What was once a problem of limited choice has become a problem of too much choice. The existence of thousands of newsgroups, World-Wide Web (WWW) sites, FTP archives, and digital libraries renders traditional methods of locating good information sources infeasible. Current WWW indexes, such as AltaVista <ref> [1] </ref>, Ly-cos [8], and Yahoo [11], which are designed for locating information on the Internet, are limited in several ways. For example, they are limited to on-line, text documents, and they give no control to the sources of the documents to determine the frequency with which they are indexed.

Reference-contexts: This system also propagates descriptions of server contents through a hierarchy of information servers. Harvest <ref> [3] </ref> automatically indexes documents within a source and distributes these indexes. It can be used to describe WWW sites, newsgroups, repositories of technical reports, etc. and includes subsystems for caching and replicating the indexes. <p> One of the advantages of Class 3 in general is that it allows intermediary metadata to be less than linear with respect to the number of sources; this is not possible in Class 1 or 2. Several resource discovery models <ref> [3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>, including Pharos, allow intermediaries to collect information from other intermediaries, including metadata describing a collection of collections, rather than just a collection of documents.

Reference-contexts: It is similar, in this regard, to the SMART automated text retrieval system [9], replacing the two-dimensional term/document matrix by a term/collection matrix.

Reference-contexts: Many of these non-text documents, as well as many text documents, are also characterized by, for example, image feature-vectors, geographical coordinates, temporal information, etc. Given these metadata extensions, we describe a new model, Pharos, shown in Figure 7. Pharos is described in detail in <ref> [5] </ref>. Pharos is designed to select a small set of (highly relevant) sources from among a very large set. <p> One of the advantages of Class 3 in general is that it allows intermediary metadata to be less than linear with respect to the number of sources; this is not possible in Class 1 or 2. Several resource discovery models <ref> [3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>, including Pharos, allow intermediaries to collect information from other intermediaries, including metadata describing a collection of collections, rather than just a collection of documents.

Reference-contexts: For example, they are limited to on-line, text documents, and they give no control to the sources of the documents to determine the frequency with which they are indexed. The gGlOSS text database discovery system <ref> [6] </ref> represents sources by vectors of term frequencies. It is similar, in this regard, to the SMART automated text retrieval system [9], replacing the two-dimensional term/document matrix by a term/collection matrix. SMART and gGlOSS are only two of several automatic text retrieval systems. <p> A fairly new approach currently 1 being discussed among some of the major WWW index vendors is the STARTS Model [7], shown in Figure 6 on the following page. In this model, built on a gGlOSS <ref> [6] </ref> framework, each source performs its own (collection) metadata extraction. The intermediary then gathers this metadata rather than extracting its own. In principle, this procedure allows off-line documents to be included, since the intermediary is not required to have direct access to documents. <p> All sizes in Table 2 after S R are related to meta-data. It is difficult to estimate these sizes; as an example, we derive two of them. For text-based vector analysis <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, the size S CT S of the full collection metadata at a source is a function of the number of unique words, t, in its collection, which is generally a function of the total number of words in the collection, N . <p> One of the advantages of Class 3 in general is that it allows intermediary metadata to be less than linear with respect to the number of sources; this is not possible in Class 1 or 2. Several resource discovery models <ref> [3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>, including Pharos, allow intermediaries to collect information from other intermediaries, including metadata describing a collection of collections, rather than just a collection of documents.

Reference-contexts: This model is shown in Figure 4. 3.2 Single Intermediary Within Class 2, the Single Intermediary models, we describe two architectures: the Brute-Force (BF) Model and the STARTS Model <ref> [7] </ref>. Both these models maintain a single intermediary between the query generators and sources. This intermediary handles both query and metadata traffic, though there is no synchronization between its reception of a query and its (collection) metadata retrieval. <p> Queries are not propagated to the sources, and results are not able to include information about documents which have not been analyzed directly by the intermediary. A fairly new approach currently 1 being discussed among some of the major WWW index vendors is the STARTS Model <ref> [7] </ref>, shown in Figure 6 on the following page. In this model, built on a gGlOSS [6] framework, each source performs its own (collection) metadata extraction. The intermediary then gathers this metadata rather than extracting its own.
