Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic characteristics of uniform scalar quantizers that are optimal with respect to mean squared error. It is shown that when a symmetric source density with infinite support is sufficiently well behaved, the optimal step size D N for symmetric uniform scalar quantization decreases as 2s N -1 V -1 1 / 6N 2 ( ) , where N is the number of quantization levels, s 2 is the source variance and V -1 () is the inverse of V (y) = y -1 P(s -1 X &gt; x) dx y . Equivalently, the optimal support length ND N increases as 2s V -1 1 / 6N 2 ( ) . Granular distortion is asymptotically well approximated by D N 2 / 12 , and the ratio of overload to granular distortion converges to a function of the limit t lim y E[ X| X &gt; y], provided, as usually happens, that t exists. When it does, its value is related to the number of finite moments of the source density; an asymptotic formula for the overall distortion D N is obtained; and t = 1 is both necessary and sufficient for the overall distortion to be asymptoti cally well approximated by D N 2 / 12 . Applying these results to the class of twosided densities of the form b x b ax a , which includes Gaussian, Laplacian, Gamma, and generalized Gaussian, it is found that t = 1, that D N decreases as (ln N) 1/a / N , that D N is asymptotically well approximated by , and that more accurate approximations to D N are possible. The results also apply to densities with onesided infinite support, such as Rayleigh and Weibull, and to densities whose tails are asymptotically similar to those previously mentioned. Key words: Uniform scalar quantization, optimal step size, granular distortion, overload distortion, generalized Gamma, asymptotic quantization theory. 1 This work was supported by NSF Grant NCR-9415754.

Reference-contexts: We focus on symmetric source densities since they simplify the analysis and since most important source densities, such as Gaussian and Laplacian, are symmetric. Though there are examples of symmetric source densities for which the optimal uniform scalar quantizer is asymmetric <ref> [5] </ref>, we restrict attention to symmetric uniform scalar quantizers because they are of more interest, easier to deal with, and have performance close to optimum. Our results extend immediately to densities with onesided infinite support, such as Rayleigh.
