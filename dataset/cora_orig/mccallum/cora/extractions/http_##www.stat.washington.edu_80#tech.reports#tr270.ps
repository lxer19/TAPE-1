Abstract: Both knowledge-based systems and statistical models are typically concerned with making predictions about future observables. Here we focus on assessment of predictive performance and provide two techniques for improving the predictive performance of Bayesian graphical models. First, we present Bayesian model averaging, a technique for accounting for model uncertainty. Second, we describe a technique for eliciting a prior distribution for competing models from domain experts. We explore the predictive performance of both techniques in the context of a urological diagnostic problem.

Reference-contexts: Our results are especially relevant to the increasing number of knowledge-based system builders and statistical analysts using Bayesian graphical models (Spiegelhalter et al., 1993, 1994). 2 Measuring predictive performance For probabilistic predictions, there exist two types of discrepancies between observed and predicted values <ref> (Gaver at al., 1992) </ref>: predictive bias (a systematic tendency to mispredict on the low or high side) and lack of calibration (a systematic tendency to over- or understate predictive accuracy). The logarithmic score combines these discrepancies into a single measure.
