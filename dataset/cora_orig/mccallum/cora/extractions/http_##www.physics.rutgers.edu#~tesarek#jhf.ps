Abstract: The KTeV program just finished taking data as part of the Fermilab fixed target program. Both KTeV experiments, E832, precision measurement of the CP violation parameters in neutral kaon decays and E799-II, search and measurement of rare neutral kaon decays, were highly successful. We present the current status of the KTeV experiments and preliminary results, based on fractions of the data, regarding new limits on supersymmetry and branching ratios for two previously unobserved decays, BR(K L ! + e + e ) = (2:6 0:5) fi 10 7 and BR(ffi 0 ! + e -) = (2:6 0:2 stat 0:3 syst ) fi 10 5 . Finally, prospects for the future will be discussed. The KTeV (Kaons at the Tevatron) program consists of two different experiments E832 and E799 each measuring properties of neutral kaon decays. Experiment E832 is designed to make precision measurements of the CP violation parameters in the neutral kaon system. Of particular interest are the ratio of complex amplitudes: In addition, we search for direct CP violation (CP violation occuring in the decay of the kaon, rather than through mixing) in the two pion decays by measuring &lt;(* 0 =*) to a precision of 1 fi 10 4 . Experiment E799 searches for rare neutral kaon decays and measures properties of some decay modes with branching ratios of 10 5 or less. Table 1 lists many decays and their physics interest. Of particular interest are the CP violating modes such as K L ! 0 ` + ` , K L ! 0 -, K L ! + e + e . The observed neutral kaon is an admixture of both the K 0 and K 0 . Within the context of the standard model, this mixing can proceed through a S = 2 transition involving the exchange of W bosons in a weak box diagram. The vertices in the box involve involve the decay or production of different quarks and can be described by a mixing matrix involving three quark generations originally formulated by Kobayashi and Maskawa [1]. Imposing a unitarity constraint to this matrix reduces the number of independent parameters to four, including a single complex phase. This phase
