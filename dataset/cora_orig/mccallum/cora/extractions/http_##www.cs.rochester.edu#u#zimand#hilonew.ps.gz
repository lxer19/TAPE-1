Title: A High-Low Kolmogorov Complexity Law Equivalent To The 0-1 Law  
Author: Marius Zimand 
Keyword: Kolmogorov complexity, logical definability, probability asymptotics.

Abstract: It is shown that the 0-1 Law for recursive logics on finite structures admits an equivalent formulation in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. The new formulation opens the possibility of using the Kolmogorov complexity apparatus to easily derive various properties for finite struc tures satisfying a given properties. Examples that illustrate this point are provided.

Reference-contexts: This property is related to the probability that a random structure with domain of size n satisfies a given formula in the logic. The 0-1 Law states that the above probability is either asymptotically 1 or asymptotically 0 as n goes to infinity. Glebskii et: al [GKLT69] and Fagin <ref> [Fag76] </ref> were the first to establish this surprising connection between logical definability and asymptotic probability by showing that first-order logic satisfies the 0-1 Law.

Reference-contexts: Excellent expositions on the incompressibility method can be found in [LV93] and [LV90]. We give three examples to illustrate its benefits: (1) the computation of a probability related to an important class of finite structures which correspond to the well studied MAX SNP class of NP optimization problems <ref> [PY91] </ref>, (2) a definability criterion which generalizes the well-known fact that parity is not expressible in any logic admitting the 0-1 Law, and (3) the evaluation of the convergence rate of instances of the 0-1 Law. <p> Such languages L form an important subclass of NP that contains NP-complete problems like 3-SAT (see [KV87] and <ref> [PY91] </ref>).
