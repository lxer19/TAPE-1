Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for learning general knowledge in a diagnostic case-based system through the use of a neural network. We take advantage of the self-adapting nature of the neural network to discover the most relevant features and combination of features for each diagnosis considered. The knowledge acquired by the network is interpreted and mapped into symbolic diagnosis descriptors, which are kept and used by the case-based system to guide its reasoning process, to retrieve cases from a case library and to build explanations. The neural network used in the learning process was the Combinatorial Neural Model, a network that has been combined with other symbolic approaches previously. The paper presents the method used to interpret the knowledge learned in the neural network, as well as the guidelines followed by the reasoning process of the CBR system. An initial experiment in clinical psychology is also reported, where the case-based model introduced here was used to learn and represent the psychological profile of patients in evaluation for heart transplant.

Reference-contexts: The psychological features of heart transplant patients have been studied since 1969 [9]. The initial studies showed the importance of a patient's psychological profile for a satisfactory outcome after the transplant <ref> [2] </ref>. At present, psychological evaluation is a routine procedure before heart transplants, used in 5 out of 6 of the transplantation centres worldwide. Between 1988 and 1994, 463 psychological evaluations were performed and catalogued in a case library at the Heart Institute of S~ao Paulo University Medical School.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) emphasises the use of particular experiences in reasoning. However, general knowledge often plays an equally important role in such systems. For example, a number of early CBR systems such as CYRUS <ref> [5] </ref> or CASEY [6] have compiled experiences in generalized episodes. These generalizations have been used to organize the case library and index the cases by exploiting the differences among them.

Reference-contexts: Our choice of neural network had much to do with our previous experience with this same network, as well as with the fact that it had been successfully combined with symbolic approaches previously, to solve problems in different application domains such as renal diseases [11], cardiology <ref> [7] </ref> and banking [16]. The paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the CNM, the operation of the network and its learning mechanism. Section 3 presents the structure of the diagnosis descriptors and details of how the knowledge stored in the neural network is interpreted and mapped into them.

Reference-contexts: A knowledge graph is described as a minimal directed AND/OR acyclic graph representing the knowledge of an expert for a specific diagnostic hypothesis <ref> [8] </ref>. The structure of the CNM is therefore very similar to that of the graphs. The CNM has a feedforward topology with three layers. The input layer is formed by fuzzy-number cells.

Reference-contexts: In Protos [15], a well-known system for the diagnosis of hearing disorders, normative experiences are stored in prototype cases. The same can be seen in more recent examples, such as in <ref> [12] </ref>, where the memory of the system is split into two levels, one containing atypical cases and the other containing prototype cases. In the architecture presented in this paper, normative experiences are not represented in the same form of cases, but in the form of diagnosis descriptors.

Reference-contexts: Each case was described in terms of the following attributes: psychological functioning, use of psychoactive substances, family dynamics, intellectual resources, adherence, motivation and knowledge about the transplant, psychological state and psychiatric antecedents in the family <ref> [14] </ref>. We have started the development of a system for psychological evaluation using part of the cases set contained in this library.

Reference-contexts: Regarding the organization of the system's memory, it can often be observed that in CBR systems both normative experiences and distinctive ones are represented as cases. In Protos <ref> [15] </ref>, a well-known system for the diagnosis of hearing disorders, normative experiences are stored in prototype cases.

Section 3 presents the structure of the diagnosis descriptors and details of how the knowledge stored in the neural network is interpreted and mapped into them. <p> Furthermore, by incorporating prototypical cases in the model, as well as positive and negative remindings in the diagnosis descriptors, we have defined a way to connect the diagnoses to real cases in the library. In <ref> [16] </ref> we have introduced another approach for combining neural networks with CBR in a system for classifying credit card transactions. In that scheme the two reasoning mechanisms work in an independent fashion, the answers provided by each of the individual mechanisms being merged by a mediator.

Reference-contexts: The main task was therefore to extract from the neural network symbolic descriptors for each diagnosis considered, in doing something similar to what is stated in some previous work <ref> [17] </ref> on combining the CNM with a frame system. Three attributes were created to describe generalized knowledge about a diagnosis. The features referenced by these attributes are characterized by their frequency and specificity in relation to the diagnosis. <p> Instead, we tried to define symbolic interpretations for the knowledge stored in the neural networks, and use these interpretations, combined with specific cases, to support the reasoning. The mapping of the knowledge stored in the neural network into diagnosis descriptors is similar to our previous work <ref> [17] </ref>. Here, however, we have discussed diagnosis descriptors more extensively and we have proposed a new method for eliciting symbolic knowledge of the neural network.

Reference-contexts: The CNM uses a punishment and reward learning algorithm to modify connection weights and force the network to converge to a desired behaviour intrinsically represented in a set of examples. This algorithm uses a simple version of the backpropagation mechanism <ref> [18] </ref>; it rewards the pathways that lead to correct results, and punishes the pathways that lead to incorrect results. Punishment and reward accumulators are stored for each connection of the network.
