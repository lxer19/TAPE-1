Abstract: In the evolution of the mammalian brain the two-sided nature of the neural motor control and sensory input has been preserved in the architecture of the cerebral matter. We believe this fundamental two-sided nature of the mammalian brain to hold a very important clue to the problem-solving capability of the higher mammals. The idea of a two-hemisphere architecture on the macro-level and modules of neural networks on the micro-level, with conflicts between the two, as observed in Nature, provides a basis for the next generation of artificial problem solvers, exemplified by our Janus architecture. This architecture consists of two halves that can independently process the same data and generate decisions about a change of the robot's state. The halves are connected by simple processing channels through which they can exchange information at various levels. The brain consists of neural networks at its lowest level, and so is adaptive, but the two sides process and learn about the environment in subtly different ways. The Janus architecture is described here in a top-down modular fashion, leading to the presentation of the model for a simple prototype system, Janus I, which is to be developed through simulation. Janus I is a first step into "reflective" architectures, whereby the system internally reflects about the capabilities and reliability of its modules.

Reference-contexts: The call for a step in the direction of the development of modular systems has frequently been made [Sel59, Min85, MP88b, Ede87, Mel88], but up till now most of the emphasis has been on developing small modular systems specialized as a whole for a particular task domain <ref> [Wai89, NKK90, SNA89, Ebe89] </ref> rather than systems capable, merely through a higher-level alteration in the specification of the architecture or environment interaction, of being used in a wide range of applications.

Reference-contexts: The choice of the architecture constraints was directly influenced by simple observations of the top-level structure and behaviour of the human brain <ref> [Ecc79, SD85] </ref>. However, the similarities end at that level and a great deal of freedom is permitted in lower-level development, within the framework of the above constraints. <p> We hope to include such differences in our model eventually in a general way through imposing greater self-supervision on the left side <ref> [Ecc79] </ref>. In the initial stages such differences will have to be more specific. Since the sides can both operate independently and process the same information differently, a mechanism exists for reconciling two opposing motor decisions, based on a dominance-recessiveness principle.

Reference-contexts: As inputs each side receives the current state of its own leg and the other leg via the inter-side channels, and the intention. The outputs consist of one of four possible suggested motions for both legs. At these outputs a winner-takes-all procedure is initiated for each leg movement <ref> [Mal73, Gro76, RZ85] </ref>, and at the same time excitatory connections channel the outputs of the left leg of the left side to the outputs of the left leg of the right side, and similarly for the right leg outputs. The competition will cease when both sides agree on leg movements.

Reference-contexts: It is intended that each important module has associated a monitor module that estimates and alters the capabilities of the important module.

Our initial experiments with such systems of neural modules have been very promising.
