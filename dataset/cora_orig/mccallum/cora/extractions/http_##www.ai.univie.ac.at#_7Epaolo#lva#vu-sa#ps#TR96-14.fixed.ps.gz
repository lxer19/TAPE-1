Abstract: We have developed an application-independent toolkit, called Collagen, based on the SharedPlan theory of collaborative discourse, in which interaction histories are hierarchically structured according to a user's goals and intentions. We have used Collagen to implement an example collaborative interface agent with discourse processing, but not natural language understanding. In this paper, we concentrate on how a segmented interaction history supports user orientation, intelligent assistance, and transformations, such as returning to earlier points in the problem solving process and replaying segments in a new context.

Reference-contexts: In particular, at the end of Figure 6, she is revisiting the earlier airline specification segment (fifth subsegment down from the top) in order to see what happens if she adds USAir to the specified airlines. RELATED WORK Cohen et al. <ref> [1] </ref> first demonstrated the use of an explicit, structured interaction history to allow users to locate and return to earlier contexts. The structure of Co-hen's histories, however, only captured the relationship between questions and follow-up questions in a query interface.

Reference-contexts: Internally, however, Moore's work does use a deep representation of the user's and system's goals. The basic idea underlying Collagen's user communication menu, namely replacing natural language understanding by natural language generation based on the expectations of context, has also been used by Fischer <ref> [2] </ref> for cooperative information retrieval and by Mittal and Moore [11] for clarification subdialogues. Finally, in terms of overall goal, the most closely related work is Stein et al.'s MERIT system [16], which also strives to systematically apply human discourse theory (albeit a different one) to human-computer interaction.

Reference-contexts: Given the interaction above, it is tempting to think of what the agent is doing as plan recognition, which is known to be exponential in the worst case <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this misses a key property of normal human discourse, namely that speakers work hard to make sure that their conversational partners can understand their intentions without a large cognitive search.

Reference-contexts: Our history representation, by comparison, captures the relationship between both actions and communications (including questions) and the goals to which they contribute, making possible much more powerful intelligent assistance and transformations. In Moore et al.'s work <ref> [7, 12] </ref>, which focuses on explanation dialogues, users are presented with a full textual history of their interaction with the system, from which they may select any phrase as the context for a further query.

The main job of discourse processing is to explain how the current communication or application act contributes to the current discourse purpose, i.e., the purpose of the top segment on the focus stack. This breaks down into five main cases.

It is important to note that these discourse processing algorithms and data structure are application-independent. The only application-specific information used is the recipe library, which contains an abstract specification of each act type and its parameters, plus recipes for implementing the non-primitive acts.
