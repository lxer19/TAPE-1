Abstract: A crucially important adequacy test of any theory of speech acts is its ability to handle performatives. This paper provides a theory of performatives as a test case for our rationally based theory of illocutionary acts. We show why "I request you. . ." is a request, and "I lie to you that p" is self-defeating. The analysis supports and extends earlier work of theorists such as Bach and Harnish [1] and takes issue with recent claims by Searle [10] that such performative-as-declarative analyses are doomed to failure.

Reference-contexts: The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties: * A sincere utterance of "I request you to open the door" is both a request and an assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other. * "I lie that the <p> The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further details of this logic can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.1 Syntax The language we use has the usual connectives of a first-order language with equality, as well as operators for the propositional attitudes and for talking about sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x p) say that p follows from x's beliefs or goals (a.k.a choices) respectively; <p> Their last event arguments would be used only in the interpretation of indexicals. 4 See other work of ours <ref> [2] </ref> for a full model theory. 5 In other words, we only deal with semantic structures where these propositions come out true. 4 3 Individual Commitments and Intentions To capture one grade of commitment that an agent might have toward his goals, we define a persistent goal, P-GOAL, to be one <p> Let us notate these correlations as: 6 For simplicity, we omit here one condition from the definition of INTEND 2 in <ref> [2] </ref>. 5 DECLARATIVE ) (BEL x (TRUE s e)) IMPERATIVE ) (GOAL x 39e' (DONE y e') ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s e' e) We formalize this notation below. <p> More critically, intending to act at time t 1 is also introspectable at time t 1 because agents know what they are doing at the next instant and because there is no time to drop their commitment <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, one can repackage these mental states up into an ATTEMPT and then a REQUEST. 6.3 Performatives Used as Assertions We have shown that the speaker of a sincere performative utterance containing an illocution-ary verb has performed the illocutionary act named by that verb.

Reference-contexts: The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in <ref> [3] </ref>, is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions [2]. 2 As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties: * A sincere utterance of "I request you to open the door" is <p> Goals are known: j=(GOAL x p) (BEL x (GOAL x p)). Memory: j= (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e) (BEL x (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e)). That is, agents remember what their beliefs were. 1 This differs from the BEFORE relation described in <ref> [3] </ref>, which is here labelled PRIOR. 2 Feel free to substitute your favorite syntactic predicates. 3 TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are just placeholders for semantic theories of truth, reference, and the meanings of imperatives, respectively. <p> we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance's features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker's mental state, termed a "core attitude" in <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be correlated with the speaker's believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker's wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence. <p> Domain Axiom 1 Declaratives and Imperatives: A. j=DECLARATIVE ) (BEL spkr (TRUE s e)) B. j= IMPERATIVE ) (GOAL x 39e'(DONE y e') ^ (FULFILL-CONDS s e' e) Below, we present our definitions of illocutionary acts.

Reference-contexts: Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying the agent (x) are also defined. An action expression here is built from variables ranging over sequences of events using the constructs of dynamic logic <ref> [4] </ref>: a;b is action composition; ajb is nondeterministic choice; ajjb is concurrent occurrence of a and b; p? is a test action; and finally, a fl is repetition. The usual programming constructs such as IF/THEN actions and WHILE loops, can easily be formed from these.

Reference-contexts: we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance's features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker's mental state, termed a "core attitude" in <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be correlated with the speaker's believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker's wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence. <p> In general, if an utterance is produced when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental state <ref> [8] </ref>. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths. To do so, we use the notion of ABEL. <p> In what follows, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between utterance events and full-blooded communicative acts. 4.1 Notation for Describing Utterance Events We now provide a formal notation for this correlation of utterance form and the speaker's mental state as a kind of default axiom (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). First, we specify who is speaking (spkr), who is observing (obs, which includes the speaker and addressee, but also others), who is 6 being addressed (addr), and what kind of sentence (s) has been spoken (indicated by ).

Reference-contexts: So, which verbs can be use performatively, and in Searle's words <ref> [10] </ref>, "how do performatives work?" Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to provide a solution to questions such as these. But, such questions are not merely of theoretical interest. <p> The most compelling defense of this performative-as-assertion analysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Harnish [1], who address many of the linguistic phenomena discussed by Sadock [9], but who, we believe, have misanalyzed indirect speech acts. However, in a recent paper, Searle <ref> [10] </ref> forcefully criticizes the performative-as-assertion approach on the following grounds: * Assertions commit the speaker to the truth of what is asserted * Performative statements are self-referential * "An essential feature of any illocutionary act is the intention to perform that act" Searle claims that accounts based on self-referential assertions are <p> Theorem 1 A Performative Request j=8 spkr, addr, e, n, t 1 , (MK spkr addr (DONE spkr t 1 ?;e) ^ (UTTER spkr addr e s)) ^ (BEFORE t 1 ?;e (GOAL spkr [AFTER t 1 ?;e 8 Searle <ref> [10] </ref> correctly points out that performatives can be uttered in the passive, and in the first-person plural. 9 We are ignoring the habitual reading of bare present tense sentences because we do not have a semantics for them. 10 (KNOW addr [BEFORE t 1 ?;e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))])])) (DONE

The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts.
