Reference-contexts: The block and inode caches in the filesystem drive much of the logic behind the algorithms used to maintain the superblock. 10 2.2.1 Free Block Cache The free block cache is documented very well in <ref> [Ba86] </ref>. When the filesystem is made, the free blocks are organized into a linked structure. The System V/386 filesystem stores 50 addresses in the block cache.

Reference-contexts: occur in the true implememtation * if ninode = 100 then return * superblock.ninode ++ * superblock.inode [superblock.ninode]=number of returnInode * return 2 Note: The implementation of the inode cache in the project versus the true implementation in the System V/386 filesystem differ somewhat, as I discovered just recently, see <ref> [Sh87] </ref>. 14 2.3 Inodes The internal inode representation, as with any Unix system, is the key to the organization of the filesytem. The System V/386 filesystem follows virtually the same format as any other Unix system, though with some important distinctions.
