Reference-contexts: In this essay we offer an alternative view for assessing TOC, namely the scientific one, and our evaluation and recommendations drastically differs from the main message of the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>. True to our nature as theoreticians, we explicitly recall the philosophical foundations on which any assessment of a scientific discipline should be based. Using these criteria, we evaluate the importance of TOC as well as its achievements so far. We also provide a critique of Aho et. al. Report [1] <p> <ref> [1] </ref>. True to our nature as theoreticians, we explicitly recall the philosophical foundations on which any assessment of a scientific discipline should be based. Using these criteria, we evaluate the importance of TOC as well as its achievements so far. We also provide a critique of Aho et. al. Report [1] which is based on the same foundations. Our fundamental theses are: * TOC is the science of computation. It seeks to understand computational phenomena, be it natural, man made or imaginative. TOC is an independent scientific discipline of fundamental importance. <p> its dissemination through education and interaction was responsible for enormous technological progress. 1 Indeed, some have already confessed to us that they feel forced to do so. 2 Indeed, some had already gleefully picked up this hammer and started applying it far beyond the naive intentions of the authors of <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 * The success of TOC is directly correlated to the extremely high quality and creativity of researchers in TOC, to their independence, and to the fundamental (and exciting) nature of the questions TOC addresses. * In order for the Theory of Computing to prosper in the future it is <p> Yet, decisions taken by individual scientists following their own understanding of the discipline differ drastically from attempts to direct the whole discipline towards directions which are not intrinsic to it. Thus, we completely reject the main conclusion in Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> that the prosperity of TOC depends on service to other disciplines and immediate applicability to the current technological development. We feel that the wrong conclusions of the Aho et. al. Report [1] follow naturally, not only from external pressures, but from what we view as misconceptions and dangerous moods that <p> Thus, we completely reject the main conclusion in Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> that the prosperity of TOC depends on service to other disciplines and immediate applicability to the current technological development. We feel that the wrong conclusions of the Aho et. al. Report [1] follow naturally, not only from external pressures, but from what we view as misconceptions and dangerous moods that have spread through the community in the last few years, which the report sadly echoes and amplifies. <p> To summarize, as the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> says, "trouble is looming for the field of TOC", but ironically it stems more from the report itself and the moods it reflects than from the outside pressures. We call all of you to examine the main theses of this essay. <p> In Chapter 3 we try to explain the reasons for a feeling of crisis within TOC and offer ways to overcome these feelings and confront outside induced problems. In Chapter 4 we provide a critique of <ref> [1] </ref>. In Chapter 5 we present our recommendations. Important comment: After reading the Aho et. al. Report [1] a month ago, we have discussed it with many colleagues. All have found major flaws and dangers in it, but none seem to plan a 3 significant rebuttle. <p> In Chapter 4 we provide a critique of <ref> [1] </ref>. In Chapter 5 we present our recommendations. Important comment: After reading the Aho et. al. Report [1] a month ago, we have discussed it with many colleagues. All have found major flaws and dangers in it, but none seem to plan a 3 significant rebuttle. <p> A third is repetition of our basic claims while boring, this was a reaction to their (near) absence in Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>. A personal comment: We consider ourselves very fortunate to have taken our first steps in the Theory of Computing in an enlightened and exciting atmosphere, very much different from the current mood. <p> One can illustrate the point above by numerous examples, and in particular the ones given in Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> (regrettably without such illustration) are perfect. We prefer to give two very recent examples whose technological and practical effects are imminent and yet to come. So far their "practicality" is demonstrated by a major leap in the algorithmic understanding of major problems. <p> It is sad to speculate that in the world where the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> is adopted (as one of its author conceded), such proposals are likely to be rejected on the basis of "plac [ing] excessive weight on mathematical depth and elegance, and attach [ing] too little importance to genuine links between theory and concrete applications", especially if written by junior people. 2.5 On <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref>. Needless to say that we believe our speculations and reject alternative speculations offered by the Aho et. al. Report (see Chapter 4). The research community in Theory of Computation (TOC) seems to be a crisis in the last few years. <p> Perhaps Mathematics and Physics provide the clearest, most outstanding examples, on a much more impressive time scale, but so do 1 The Introduction of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> provides a good illustration to our claims; see Chapter 4. 13 Biology, Medicine, Psychology and many others. In judging such a state of affairs, and deciding if to quit or continue, indeed it is not sufficient that the ultimate goals are of fundamental importance. <p> This include all faculty members in systems and applications research. 15 Finally, we completely agree with Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> that a popularization of the main achievements of TOC is needed. <p> The Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> mentions the saturation in the academic job market and the shrinking funds for U.S. funding agencies. We add to this list the pressure put by non-theory computer scientists and by university administrations on TOC to contribute to applied computer science projects. <p> Finally, chairs and deans should be convinced to judge work not by the grants it attracts (as this is already biased against TOC and by the recommendations of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> will be further biased). Rather, being academic leaders they should judge the work by academic standards, and if needed, influence funding to correct biases. None of these tasks is easy by any means. <p> Report In this section we take the task of pointing out our major disagreements with the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>, as well as the sources of these disagreements. This task is made hard as the report fails to explicitely state the methodological foundations on which it bases its views. This lack in itself is a major flaw. <p> The report's unjust critique of the value structure of TOC. 8. The report's controversial view of the history of TOC. 9. What will TOC look like if the report is adopted. We remind the reader that Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> has taken upon itself to "assesses the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community and suggests actions and initiatives to enhance the community's impact and productivity". 4.1 Authority and representation The first and foremost danger is that the Aho et. al. Report [1] report is taken <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref> has taken upon itself to "assesses the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community and suggests actions and initiatives to enhance the community's impact and productivity". 4.1 Authority and representation The first and foremost danger is that the Aho et. al. Report [1] report is taken as the representative and authoritative view on its subject matter (which amplifies the effect of every flaw in it). This is 17 certainly (by definition) the perception of those who solicited the report. <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref> misrepresents the relation of TOC to the rest of Computer Science (CS) as well as to other disciplines. It seems as if the Aho et. al. Report regards TOC as a subcontractor of the rest of CS and the other disciplines. Our view of the relationship is different. <p> But a forced redirection of any of these parties, contrary to their intrinsic goals, has no place in the academia. 4.3 Future Prosperity The main recommendation of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> is the redirection of TOC scientists towards goals which are not intrinsic to TOC. To quote [1]: In order for TOC to prosper in the coming years, it is essential to strengthen our communication with the rest of computer science and with other disciplines, and to increase our impact on <p> But a forced redirection of any of these parties, contrary to their intrinsic goals, has no place in the academia. 4.3 Future Prosperity The main recommendation of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> is the redirection of TOC scientists towards goals which are not intrinsic to TOC. To quote [1]: In order for TOC to prosper in the coming years, it is essential to strengthen our communication with the rest of computer science and with other disciplines, and to increase our impact on key application areas. <p> In contrary, our main recommendation (based on the clear scientific foundations laid in Chapter 2) is for the TOC community to concentrate on TOC research. Searching <ref> [1] </ref> for a justification of its main recommendation, we only found the following opportunistic justification (in the same paragraph): If we do so then funding will flow to TOC from a variety of sources, young theoretical computer scientists will have good employment opportunities, our field will contribute to the revolutionary developments <p> Furthermore, we fear that the negative influence on funding and jobs (which seem to be the report's main concern) will be the only effect of the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>. We believe that a serious effort should be made to reverse the self-fulfilling prophecies of the Aho et. al. Report. * draw intellectual stimulation. This must be a joke. The last thing TOC lacks is intellectual stimulation. <p> But we are not their subcontractors nor should we be (and nor will they want us to be if they were explained the above). 4.4 Communicating the fundamental nature of TOC The Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> fails to communicate (despite its promise to do so in its title and abstract) the scientific goals of TOC. Further, it neglects to clearly state and explain the fundamental nature and importance of the formative questions of TOC; that is, the questions relating to the nature of efficient computation. <p> Further, it neglects to clearly state and explain the fundamental nature and importance of the formative questions of TOC; that is, the questions relating to the nature of efficient computation. We see no justification or explanation for this failure. Furthermore, the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> fails to communicate that the TOC agenda constitutes a scientific task of gigantic proportions which is in need of the best creative forces and external support to continue its successful work. It is ironic that the Aho et. al. Report [1], in pointing to the need for TOC by computer <p> Furthermore, the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> fails to communicate that the TOC agenda constitutes a scientific task of gigantic proportions which is in need of the best creative forces and external support to continue its successful work. It is ironic that the Aho et. al. Report [1], in pointing to the need for TOC by computer and other sciences, misses this as key indication to TOC fundamental importance and impact. In general, the scientific perspective on concepts and achievements of TOC is rarely and briefly presented in Aho et. al. Report [1], and the focus is mostly <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref>, in pointing to the need for TOC by computer and other sciences, misses this as key indication to TOC fundamental importance and impact. In general, the scientific perspective on concepts and achievements of TOC is rarely and briefly presented in Aho et. al. Report [1], and the focus is mostly on the technological and industrial impacts. Clearly such a basis cannot suffice to convince anyone that a scientific discipline is engaged in fundamental work, nor to evaluate its real achievements. <p> Even the detailed examples (except NP completeness) are praised mainly from their application viewpoint and even this is done from a strange perspective (e.g., "..ten billion dollar industry..") The authors of <ref> [1] </ref> are surely aware of the generally accepted foundations of assessing scientific disciplines that we recalled in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above. Nevertheless, even when they praise TOC achievements, there is never a scientific argument to substantiate it. <p> These clearly convey the fundamental nature of our scientific goals. This neglect in Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> will cause significant damage. The following example may demonstrate that what is so wrong in the report. The Aho et. al. <p> The following example may demonstrate that what is so wrong in the report. The Aho et. al. Report explicitly states that the discovery of the Interior Point Algorithm by Karmarkar in 1984 is equally important to the implementation of the algorithm by Karmarkar in the following years <ref> [1, P. 6] </ref>. We hope that the authors of [1] do not really think so and that they were merely carried away in their attempt to encourage the implementation of novel algorithms. <p> The Aho et. al. Report explicitly states that the discovery of the Interior Point Algorithm by Karmarkar in 1984 is equally important to the implementation of the algorithm by Karmarkar in the following years [1, P. 6]. We hope that the authors of <ref> [1] </ref> do not really think so and that they were merely carried away in their attempt to encourage the implementation of novel algorithms. Still, the message sent by this way of evaluating scientific progress (and the strange ad-hoc justification given that follows it) is wrong and dangerous. <p> There is no mention, let alone stress, of the time, stamina, interaction and connections between distinct subareas, which made some of the most celebrated recent (and past) results possible. Lacking these, the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> creates an impression that the field is stagnant. This impression is intensified by the statement that our field has discovered hard problems which may take decades to solve. <p> However, if Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> chose this measure, it should have done a better job using it, not to mention trying to justify its use. We claim that the Aho et. al. Report [1] greatly underestimate of the technological impact of TOC. <p> However, if Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> chose this measure, it should have done a better job using it, not to mention trying to justify its use. We claim that the Aho et. al. Report [1] greatly underestimate of the technological impact of TOC. All the report contains in this regard are very few (good) examples in the introduction. <p> This is too often taken for granted, especially by those who like to bash theory. They should be constantly reminded of the conceptual 3 Except in the telegraphic list of <ref> [1, Sec. 2] </ref> mentioned above. 21 frameworks and algorithmic insights they have borrowed and continue to borrow from TOC. The Aho et. al. Report should have highlighted this reminder. The Aho et. al. <p> Indeed why does Applied CS need us so badly, if not for these frameworks and insights. Unfortunately, Applied CS tend not to realize that also it needs TOC to further recreate and develops these frameworks and insights. The Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> should have done this explanation too. Another major point not communicated by Aho et. al. Report is that more often than not the technological impact of TOC ideas materialized in very roundabout ways, and stemmed from models that had little if anything to do with practical applications. <p> Many of these, and cryptography is but one example, had an impressive impact on technology, which is still growing at fantastic speed. Indeed, if seeking to seriously judge the impact of TOC on technology the authors of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> should have studied computer technology in depth, in a fair attempt to understand the academic sources of major successes. <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref> is the "wrong" value structure of TOC. In their definition of Application Specific Theory, the Aho et. al. Report [1] says that ".. this area has not flourished to the same extent as Core Theory and Fundamental Algorithms. <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref> is the "wrong" value structure of TOC. In their definition of Application Specific Theory, the Aho et. al. Report [1] says that ".. this area has not flourished to the same extent as Core Theory and Fundamental Algorithms. <p> While there is no doubt that implementation has to take into account many factors when trying to create a (potentially) working product, the progress of theoretical work depends on the ability to abstract away such factors and elucidating the important ones. If Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> wanted to voice the opinion that this "wrong" value structure was the reason that TOC did not engage in implementation and fine-tuning, they should have stressed that it is nevertheless the "absolutely right" value structure for achieving the intrinsic goals of TOC. <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref> concedes should go on. 4.8 History according to the Aho et. al. Report The Formative Years. The Aho et. al. Report identifies 1955-75 as the "formative years" of TOC. <p> Maturity. The Aho et. al. Report state as a fact that TOC has achieved maturity (e.g., see <ref> [1, P. 11] </ref>). Again, it is not clear what criteria has been applied here and our personal feeling is that TOC is still in its childhood. <p> When progress in the field is currently proceeding in full speed, where is the sense of maturity emanating from? This point of view serves the recommendations of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>, as it creates the atmosphere that there are less things to do in TOC, and we can turn to other objectives such as implementations and fine-tuning. Again, no justification is given by the authors to their evaluation of maturity, and we completely reject its implied consequences. <p> Certainly, this should be true in an active discipline which constantly generates new notions, connections and targets for study in its strive to understand efficient computation. If the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> still wanted to take on such a role, its authors should have justified their assessments by a serious comparative study of the evolution of TOC and other disciplines. 4.9 TOC according to the Aho et. al. <p> Report are adopted (especially by parties alien to TOC). Who will join TOC? The Aho et. al. Report states that in the last 20 years TOC has "attracted to its ranks some of the brightest young scientists" <ref> [1, P. 2, L. 4-5] </ref>. Why were these bright scientists attracted to TOC? Will they be attracted to TOC when it takes the form advocated by the Aho et. al. <p> Why were these bright scientists attracted to TOC? Will they be attracted to TOC when it takes the form advocated by the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>? We believe that these bright scientists were attracted to TOC because of the strong appeal of the fundamental questions which TOC is all about. They were attracted too by the exciting atmosphere of research and achievement TOC. <p> While we may have less jobs to offer to the future generations, we have to make sure that we continue to attract the most creative and talented. The precondition of fundamental and important questions is threatened to be taken away by adopting the recommendations of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>, and the precondition of exciting atmosphere is reversed by moods as portrayed in Aho et. al. Report [1]. <p> The precondition of fundamental and important questions is threatened to be taken away by adopting the recommendations of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref>, and the precondition of exciting atmosphere is reversed by moods as portrayed in Aho et. al. Report [1]. <p> Report <ref> [1] </ref>. It should be emphasized that such decisions must take the responsibility of giving up the unforseeable fruits of this model, including PCPs and the revolution in understanding approximation mentioned above. But 2-party proof systems is merely one example. We claim that the attitude reflected in the Aho et. al. <p> These revolutionary ideas are the engine of any science and were the key to so much of TOC success. Thus, the attitudes reflected in the Aho et. al. Report constitute a big danger to science. The good hearted may point out that the Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> does suggest to continue supporting research in "core theory and fundamental algorithms", and not to shrink funds for this support. <p> Report seems to recognize the importance of interaction between the various areas of TOC. We fear, however, that their recommendations will tear TOC apart into non-interacting entities confined in their application areas. This will be the direct consequence of Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> demand from TOC researchers to invest time in implementation and fine-tuning the results in their area, which will drain the time for keeping up and interacting with other areas of TOC. <p> The Aho et. al. Report does acknowledge this point and seems to suggest to maintain a small avantgarde for these purposes <ref> [1, P. 3, L. 27-35] </ref>. Our point is that the TOC community is below the critical mass and cannot afford having its most brilliant minds taken away. We consider any form of discouraging TOC research to be a dangerous impediment to science. The applicability of TOC. <p> This reminds us of the comment "too many notes" attributed to Emperor Joseph II hearing Cosi fan tutti. Again, we disagree with this thesis completely. 4.10 Summary The Aho et. al. Report <ref> [1] </ref> suggests that TOC harness itself to help technology and other disciplines. Our answer is that TOC is too small a field (in number of scientists) to handle the fundamental questions which constitute it. The intellectual challenges of TOC are gigantic and of the greatest importance.

Reference-contexts: To be on the safe side, here is some evidence. An excellent demonstration of the the fundamental nature of TOC was provided by Papadim-itriou <ref> [2] </ref> in his survey on the impact of NP-completeness on other sciences. Papadimitriou lists about 20 diverse scientific disciplines which were unsuccessfully struggling with some of their internal questions and came to recognize their intrinsic complexity when realizing that these questions are, in some form, NP-complete.
