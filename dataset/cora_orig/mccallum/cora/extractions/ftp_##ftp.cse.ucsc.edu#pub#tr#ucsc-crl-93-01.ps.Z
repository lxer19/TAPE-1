Reference-contexts: These are often incorporated in large visualization projects developed at the nation's leading research laboratories such as those reported in [Phil90]. Some of the more recent work in flow visualization include a virtual environment interface <ref> [Brys92] </ref>, an interactive flow visualization using color lookup tables [VanG92], and extending direct volume visualization from scalar to vector fields [Craw92]. Another driving force in visualization is medical imaging.

Reference-contexts: Techniques for viewing three dimensional data volumes have evolved from image processing and data conversion. A few examples would be extracting contour edges and surface tiling [Fuch77], finding isosurfaces with the marching cubes algorithm [Lore87] and 3D surface shading in the cuberille and voxel environment <ref> [Chen85, Kauf88, Levo88] </ref>, and finally to direct volume visualization that simulates the amount of material traversed by a light ray in an opacity parameter [Dreb88, Upso88, Sabe88].

Another driving force in visualization is medical imaging. Non-invasive techniques for data gathering produce cross-sectional views that must be reconstructed (e.g. curved coronal views of the lumbar spine [Rhod85]) to facilitate understanding of the underlying three dimensional structure and aid in pre-surgical planning [Gold85].

Reference-contexts: First of all, it is convenient to think of sparts as small spherical balls or light emitting points. However, the individual sparts may also take the form of glyphs <ref> [Ells88] </ref> or 3D icons. For example, one can create paint particles that are shaped like leaves. These particles can then be sprayed or thrown into the wind to highlight wind flow and the presence of vortices.

Reference-contexts: A major driving force is fulfilling the flow visualization requirements usually found in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) experiments.

Reference-contexts: In data poor environment, data are sparsely distributed and often in unstructured, irregular grids. An initial work along this direction that handles unorganized data points is already being undertaken <ref> [Hopp92] </ref>. Another consideration is that data may be noisy and users must be given a visual assessment of data quality at different spatial locations. Still another challenge is to provide interactive steering capabilities to computational problems.

Reference-contexts: Examples usually include avoiding collision, maintaining average speed and direction, as well as not straying too far away from the group center. More recently, interaction of the characters with their environment has been incorporated. An example of this is the leaves in the wind simulation <ref> [Wejc91] </ref>. Although both particle systems and behavioral animation were originally designed for modeling and animation applications, the combination of these two ideas provide a synergy with very promising contributions in the context of a framework for visualization.
