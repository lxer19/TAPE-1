Title: Fast Subsequence Matching in Time-Series Databases

Abstract: We present an efficient indexing method to locate 1-dimensional subsequences within a collection of sequences, such that the subsequences match a given (query) pattern within a specified tolerance. The idea is to map each data sequence into a small set of multidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then, these rectangles can be readily indexed using traditional spatial access methods, like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case efficiently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements). We compared the method to sequential scanning, which is the only obvious competitor. The results were excellent: our method accelerated the search time from 3 times up to 100 times.

Reference-contexts: For example, D () can be the Euclidean distance.) The case of `whole match' queries can be handled as follows <ref> [2] </ref>: A distance-preserving transform, such as the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), can be used to extract f features from sequences (eg., the first f DFT coefficients), thus mapping them into points in the f-dimensional feature space. <p> Text and DNA strings can be viewed as 1-dimensional sequences; however, they consist of discrete symbols as opposed to continuous numbers, which makes a difference when we do the feature extraction. * `whole matching' approximate queries on time-sequences <ref> [2] </ref> or on color images [14, 21] or even on 3-d MRI brain scans [8]. <p> The resulting index that contains points in feature space is called F index <ref> [2] </ref>. The F-index works as follows: Given N sequences, all of the same length n, we apply the n-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and we keep the first few coefficients. Let's assume that we keep f numbers - thus, each sequence is mapped into a point in an f-dimensional space. <p> That is, we want to prove that D object (Q; O) * ) D feature (F (Q); F (O)) * (2) However, this is obvious, since D feature (F (Q); F (O)) D object (Q; O) * (3) 2 Following <ref> [2] </ref>, we use the Euclidean distance as the distance function between two sequences, that is, the sum of squared differences. <p> for two sequences S and Q of the same length l, we define their distance D (S; Q) as i=1 ! 1=2 As an example of feature extraction function F () we choose the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for two reasons: (a) it has been used successfully for `whole matching' <ref> [2] </ref> and (b) it provides a good, intuitive example to make the presentation more clear. It should be noted that our method is independent of the specific feature extraction function F (), as long as F () satisfies the condition of Lemma 1 (Eq. 1). <p> We keep the first few (2-3) coefficients of the DFT as the features, following the recommendation in <ref> [2] </ref>. This `truncation' results in under-estimating the distance of two sequences (because we ignore positive terms from equation 4) and thus it introduces no false dismissals, according to Lemma 1. The truncation will introduce only false alarms, which, for practical sequences, we expect to be few. <p> Each point was a real number, having a size of 4 bytes. Figure 4 (a) shows a sample of 250 points of such a stock price sequence. The system is written in `C' under AIX, on an IBM RS/6000. Based on the results of <ref> [2] </ref>, we used only the first 3 frequencies of the DFT; thus our feature space has f =6 dimensions (real and imaginary parts of each retained DFT coefficient). <p> This method generalizes the work in <ref> [2] </ref>, 9 log-log scale (w=128, Len (Q) =512 points). random walk data in a log-log scale (Len (Q) =w=512 points). which examined the `whole matching' case (i.e., all queries and all the sequences in the time-series database had to have the same length).

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to handle subsequence queries, by mapping data sequences into a few rectangles in feature space. Since we rely on spatial access methods as the eventual indexing mechanism, we mention that several multidimensional indexing methods have been proposed, forming three classes: R*-trees <ref> [9] </ref> and the rest of the R-tree family [15, 17, 28]; linear quadtrees [26, 24]; and grid-files [22]. To guarantee that the `F-index' method above does not result in any false dismissals, the distance in feature space should match or underestimate the distance between two objects. <p> These MBRs can be subsequently stored in a spatial access method. We have used R*-trees <ref> [9] </ref>, in which case these MBRs are recursively grouped into parent MBRs, grandparent MBRs etc. <p> Figure 4 (c) similarly plots the amplitudes of the 1-st and 2-nd DFT coefficients. For both figures the window size w was 512 points. The smooth evolution of both curves justifies our method to group successive points of the feature space in MBRs. An R*-tree <ref> [9] </ref> was used to store the MBRs of each sub-trail in feature space. We carried out experiments to measure the performance of the most promising method: `I-adaptive'. For each setting, we asked queries with variable selectivities, and we measured the wall-clock time on a dedicated machine.
