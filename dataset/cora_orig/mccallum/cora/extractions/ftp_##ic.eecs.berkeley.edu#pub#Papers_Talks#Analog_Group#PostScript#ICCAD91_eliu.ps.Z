Abstract: This paper presents a behavioral representation for the class of Nyquist rate A/D converters. The representation captures the nominal A/D behavior, as well as all the statistical variations. The variations are classified into noise and process variations according to how these non-idealities affect the A/D behavior. To describe noise effects we use a joint probability density function. To describe behavioral effects due to process variations we use a variance-covariance matrix, t , which is a generalization of the integral nonlinearity vector. t 's rank characterizes the testability of an A/D; its decomposition yields efficient strategies for A/D testing. Finally, parameter extraction results obtained from prototypes are presented.

Reference-contexts: Behavioral simulators have been implemented using the C++ language on a DECstation 3100 for the following circuits and their parameter extraction results are presented below. (a) t for a 4 bit resistor string A/D (figure 3, CPU time negligible) (b) t for a 4 bit Cyclic A/D generated by CADICS <ref> [1] </ref> (figure 4, CPU time 0.5 secs) (c) Error signatures for A/D in (b) The first signature corresponds to offset error. The second corresponds approximately to gain error.

Reference-contexts: This approach is inefficient because these parameters are not totally independent. In fact, all of these parameters can be derived from t , a variance-covariance matrix. The traditional CAD approach to A/D behavioral modeling is to model the A/D transfer function <ref> [2] </ref> only. For a Nyquist rate A/D, the transfer function maps a continuous input value to an output code as shown in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Using this procedure, c is a multivariate normal distribution with r statistically independent variates. The columns of U are called the error signatures <ref> [3] </ref> and form a set of orthonormal vectors spanning the error space. While t completely describes the distribution of the transition points, often the differences between the transition points provide more insight into some A/D architectures.
