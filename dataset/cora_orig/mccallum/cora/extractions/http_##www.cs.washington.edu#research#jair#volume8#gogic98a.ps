Abstract: Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of "knowledge compilation," supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.

Reference-contexts: There are many instances of such enumeration problems in the literature, for which no output-polynomial algorithm is known (despite the fact that, in contrast to NP-complete problems, it is trivial to output the first solution). The most famous one is to compute all transversals of a hypergraph <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995) </ref> (see the Appendix for a definition and discussion of this problem).

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that recent research paints a rosier picture for the TRANSVERSAL problem, by showing that it can be done in output-subexponential time <ref> (Fredman & Khachiyan, 1996) </ref>; but still, no output-polynomial algorithm is known. Theorem 1: Enumerating all clauses of the Horn envelope of a given set M of models is TRANSVERSAL-hard.

Reference-contexts: Call a clause pure if it contains only positive or only negative literals. A Boolean formula in CNF is called pure if it contains only pure clauses. PURE3SAT is the problem of deciding whether a pure 3CNF formula is satisfiable; it is known to be NP-complete <ref> (e.g. Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There are Horn sets that can be represented much more succinctly by characteristic models than by formulae, but there are also examples showing the opposite. One definite advantage of the characteristic models representation is that it allows for polynomial-time abduction <ref> (Kautz, Kearns, and Selman 1993, 1995) </ref>. Our next result points out a disadvantage of the characteristic models over Horn formulae.

Reference-contexts: Finally, although we do argue that our approach is surrounded by negative complexity results in almost all directions, we are of course not claiming that it is the only computationally feasible approach that is possible. 2.
