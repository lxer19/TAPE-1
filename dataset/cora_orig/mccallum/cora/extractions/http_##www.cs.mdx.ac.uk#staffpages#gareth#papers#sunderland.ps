Abstract: The machining of a mechanical part will normally involve the removal of a number of separate volumes. There will generally be more than one method of removing each volume; there may be a choice of tools, fixtures, machines, or even processes. It is relatively simple to determine the optimal method for removing each individual volume, but it is the optimal combination of methods - giving the lowest total finished part cost - which is actually important. Finding this optimal combination is a diffi cult task, since (with the exception of very simple parts) the number of possible combinations is far too large to be enumerated. An automated process planning system must necessarily be able to select one removal method for each volume (feature) of a part, and also order those removals into the best sequence. At what stage in the process planning task this is done depends upon the approach taken. It is suggested that the later these decisions are left, the easier it will be to find an optimal combination of methods. Such an approach to the design of an automated process planning system is outlined here. An analysis of the selection and sequencing task shows it to have important similar ities to problems which have been successfully tackled by tech niques originating in artificial intelligence (AI) research. It was therefore felt that these AI techniques might be appropriate to this part of the process planning problem; this paper explores the feasibility of their application. It was found that the nature of the task is such that it is not necessary to resort to a knowledge based (expert systems) approach; there are other AI techniques which can lead to a simpler and more efficient solution.
