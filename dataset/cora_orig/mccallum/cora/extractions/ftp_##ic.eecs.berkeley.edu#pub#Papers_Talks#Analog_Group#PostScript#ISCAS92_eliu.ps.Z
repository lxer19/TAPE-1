Abstract: This paper presents a behavioral representation for the class of Nyquist rate A/D converters that captures the nominal behavior, as well as all the statistical variations. To describe noise effects we use a joint probability density function. To describe behavioral effects due to process variations we use a covariance matrix, t . Applications of the model include identification of important A/D error sources, efficient computation of the distributions of integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL), signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (TSNR), and efficient worst case and Monte Carlo system simulations. Finally, parameter extraction results are presented that agree well with actual measurements.

Reference-contexts: The traditional SPICE simulation is clearly not viable because (a) the simulation speed is too slow for worst case or Monte Carlo simulations for yield predictions (b) SPICE cannot calculate noise effects of sampled data circuits, so TSNR cannot be calculated for architectures with such circuits. Recent approaches <ref> [1] </ref> model components of A/D converters with behavioral models and are capable of finding the transfer function in a more timely fashion.

Reference-contexts: For example, to verify worst case system performance without detailed knowledge of the A/D architecture, 2 m simulations have to be performed. (b) Noise effects are not modeled, so TSNR cannot be calculated. In this paper we present a behavioral model <ref> [2] </ref> for the class of Nyquist rate A/D (Section 2) and some parameter extraction techniques for effects due to process variations (Section 3.1).

Reference-contexts: Mathematically, t = U c U T (5) where U is an 2 N x r transformation matrix, c is an r x r diagonal matrix, and r is the rank of t . The columns of U are called the error signatures <ref> [3] </ref> and form a set of orthonormal vectors spanning the error space.

Reference-contexts: Using a fabricated algorithmic A/D <ref> [4] </ref> as an example, Section 3.1 illustrates parameter extraction techniques for effects due to process variations, followed by algorithms to compute distributions of INL and DNL (Section 3.2), a D/A synthesis example (Section 3.3), an efficient algorithm for computing TSNR (Section 3.4), and a procedure to identify important A/D error sources <p> Therefore, they are ignored, and the rank r of t is set to three instead of six. To verify that the first three errors vectors are sufficient to characterize this A/D, we obtained the measured error, ^ t t , of a fabricated A/D <ref> [4] </ref>, and try to work backwards from the data to the error location described by U ^c using (6).

Reference-contexts: The nominal transition points, t , are found by simulation of the A/D using nominal components and searching for each of the transition points using an iterative bisection search algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The sensitivity of the transition points with respect to the process variations, S v = @t @v , is found using the finite difference method by perturbating the nominal system with each of the process variations.

Reference-contexts: The DNL's nominal value and covariance matrix are given by d and d , respectively, d = D + s (16) + (17) 3.3 D/A synthesis To illustrate the efficiency of this approach to computing INL and DNL of a high resolution D/A, a simple example of performance-driven hierarchical synthesis <ref> [6] </ref> is briefly described. In this example, numerical optimization with behavioral simulation is used for high level architecture selection, as opposed to worst case analytical analysis in [7] or ruled based systems [8].

We used an existing optimizer to find the optimal resolutions of the stages of a two stage, interpolative 10 bit D/A for a performance constraint of 3 INL and DNL less than 2 and 0.5 lsb, respectively, where lsb refers to the smallest output step.
