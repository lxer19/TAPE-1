Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any centralized administration or standard support services. In such an environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of others in forwarding a packet to its destination, due to the limited propagation range of each mobile host's wireless transmissions. Some previous attempts have been made to use conventional routing protocols for routing in ad hoc networks, treating each mobile host as a router. This position paper points out a number of problems with this design and suggests a new approach based on separate route discovery and route maintenance protocols.

Reference-contexts: This scheme is similar to that used for finding source routes in source routing bridges in IEEE 802 LANs. The Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR) work also used source routing in wireless networks, but the routes were staticly configured by the user <ref> [4] </ref>. Since many mobile hosts may be within transmission range of each other, though, there may be many duplicate copies of each request propagated.

Reference-contexts: example, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is nearing completion of a proposed standard for mobile host internetworking in the Internet, involving the support services of a home agent on a mobile host's home network, and a foreign agent on the foreign network currently being visited by the mobile host <ref> [8] </ref>. In an ad hoc network, no home agent or foreign agent is available. Some form of routing protocol is in general necessary in such an environment, since two hosts that may wish to exchange packets might not be able to communicate directly. <p> We are also exploring additional areas related to ad hoc networking, such as the routing between an ad hoc network and a wide-area network such as the Internet: if one or more of the mobile hosts in an ad hoc network are also connected to the Internet <ref> [8] </ref>, it is possible for other mobile hosts in the ad hoc network to communicate with Internet hosts, but additional routing support is needed for them to learn an appropriate route to these Internet hosts and for Internet hosts to be able to route packets into the ad hoc network.

In effect, mobile host B in Figure 1 acts as a router between the network directly reachable by A and the network directly reachable by C. Host A transmits its packets for C to B, which then forwards them on to C. <p> The speed of convergence may be improved by sending routing updates more frequently, but such a shift only wastes more bandwidth and battery power when topology changes are less dramatic. Some of these problems can be addressed by improvements to the routing protocol <ref> [9] </ref>, but many of the problems still remain. This position paper, instead, takes the view that a new approach to routing in ad hoc networks is needed. 3. Route Discovery and Maintenance The problem of routing can be divided into the two areas of route discovery and route maintenance.

Reference-contexts: Host A transmits its packets for C to B, which then forwards them on to C. Conventional routing protocols are based on either distance vector or link state algorithms <ref> [10] </ref>. In distance vector routing, each router maintains a table giving the distance from itself to all possible destinations. Each router periodically broadcasts this information to each of its neighbor routers, and uses the values received from its neighbors to compute updated values for its own table.

ARP is designed for dynamically translating a host's network protocol address (such as an IP address <ref> [12] </ref>) to its MAC-level address (such as an Ethernet address). A host attempting to translate another host's address broadcasts a query packet onto its local network, which is answered by the target host giving its MAC address; other hosts on the local network receiving the query do not reply.

Reference-contexts: This route discovery exchange between the two end mobile hosts could optionally be piggybacked on the first data packets sent between them. For example, when opening a TCP connection, separate packets are usually used to exchange SYN and ACK control bits between the two end hosts of the connection <ref> [13] </ref>; the route discovery information could easily be carried in these same packets. If the end mobile hosts use a flow setup protocol to reserve resources or bandwidth for a specified quality of service between them, this route discovery exchange could likewise be integrated with the flow setup exchange.
