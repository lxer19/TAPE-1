Abstract: This paper describes a technique to automatically locate emphasized segments of a speech recording based on pitch. These salient portions can be used in a variety of applications, but were originally designed to be used in an interactive system that enables highspeed skimming and browsing of speech recordings. Previous techniques to detect emphasis have used Hidden Markov Models; emphasized regions in close temporal proximity were found to successfully create useful summaries of the recordings. The new research described herein presents a sim - pler technique to detect salient segments and summarize a recording without using statistical models that require large amounts of training data. The algorithm adapts to the pitch range of a speaker, then automatically selects the regions of highest pitch activity as a measure of emphasis.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Pitch (fundamental frequency or F0) provides infor - mation in speech that is important for comprehension and un - derstanding, and can also be exploited for machine-mediated systems. There are many techniques to determine pitch <ref> [1] </ref> [2], but there have been few attempts to extract high-level informa - tion from pitch for use in segmenting speech recordings. <p> There are several clearly identifi - able areas of increased pitch activity. Figure 2 is a close-up of the same data. Note that pitch extraction is difficult <ref> [1] </ref>, and that the resulting data may be noisy and contain anomalous points. 50 150 250 0 1 0 2 0 30 4 0 Time (seconds) Fig. 1 F0 plot of a monologue from a male talker.

There are many techniques to determine pitch [1] <ref> [2] </ref>, but there have been few attempts to extract high-level informa - tion from pitch for use in segmenting speech recordings. <p> Creating software that can automatically locate acoustic correlates of these features is thus difficult. Automatically locating emphasized or stressed por - tions of a recording is easier (stress can be thought of as an acoustic marker to highlight semantically important words in an utterance <ref> [2] </ref> [14]), but emphasis is not always correlated with major topics. A talker may use emphasis for a variety of reasons in addition to indicating a new or important point [15]. Some talkers also tend to emphasize just about everything they say, making it hard to identify important segments.

EMPHASIS DETECTION Chen and Withgott trained a Hidden Markov Model (HMM, see [18]) on hand-marked data to detect emphasis based on the pitch and energy content of conversations <ref> [3] </ref>. Emphasized portions in close temporal proximity were found to successfully create summaries of the recordings. This prosodic approach for extracting high-level information from speech signals is promising as it does not require any lexical recogni - tion or understanding.

FUTURE WORK Some errors are made by the algorithm, such as selecting unimportant portions of a recording, or missing important ones. <p> These errors can probably be reduced by refining the metrics, or combining the emphasis detection with other prosodic in - formation such as pause length. Along with informal evaluations, such as those described in <ref> [8] </ref>, it is necessary to develop more formalized evaluation methods to extend and refine these speech processing tech - niques. One of the problems associated with evaluation is in precisely defining the information that one wants to extract from the speech signal.

Reference-contexts: A speaker may increase their pitch range to highlight the information in a particular phrase, and the pitch range is expanded at the beginning of a new topic <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, in an investigation of fundamental frequency and discourse structure, it was found that topic changes were associated with large increases in F0 [16]. <p> A talker may use emphasis for a variety of reasons in addition to indicating a new or important point <ref> [15] </ref>. Some talkers also tend to emphasize just about everything they say, making it hard to identify important segments. Perhaps the best way to evaluate such a system is to have a large database of appropriately labeled speech data. <p> Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg say final lowering re - flects the degree of finality of an utterance; the more final lowering the more the sense that an utterance completes a topic <ref> [15, p. 279] </ref>. CONCLUSION A technique for automatically locating emphasized por - tions of a speech signal is described. The algorithm uses simple metrics to measure the pitch activity within a region of a speech recording. The algorithm is straightforward and effi - cient to implement.

Reference-contexts: Automatically finding features such as increased pitch range and final lowering in a speech signal is difficult, as pitch data contains similar features at different scales. Ostendorf says prosody can operate at multiple levels (e.g., word, phrase, sen - tence, paragraph), making computational modeling of prosody particularly challenging <ref> [19, p. 315] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A variety of hand labeled speech databases are available, but much of the existing labeling has been oriented toward speech recognition systems rather than high-level information based on the prosody of spontaneous speech (however, see <ref> [21] </ref>). Use of such databases allows algorithms to be tested, com - pared, and improved. For example, it would be possible to evaluate different scoring metrics, such as comparing the use of range or standard deviation against the threshold measure, in an unbiased manner.
