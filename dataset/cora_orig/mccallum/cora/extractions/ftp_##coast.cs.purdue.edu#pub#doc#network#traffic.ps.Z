Abstract: In this paper, we characterize wide-area network applications that use the TCP transport protocol. We also describe a new way to model the wide-area traffic generated by a stub network. We believe the traffic model presented here will be useful in studying congestion control, routing algorithms, and other resource management schemes for existing and future networks. Our model is based on trace analysis of TCP/IP wide-area internetwork traffic. We collected the TCP/IP packet headers of USC, UCB, and Bellcore networks at the point they connect with their respective regional access networks. We then wrote a handful of programs to analyze the traces. Our model characterizes individual TCP conversations by the distributions of: number of bytes transferred, duration, number of packets transferred, packet size, and packet interarrival time. Our trace analysis shows that both interactive and bulk transfer traffic from all sites reflect a large number of short conversations. Similarly, it shows that a very large percentage of traffic is bidirectional, even for bulk transfer. We observed that interactive applications send significantly different amounts of data in each direction of a conversation, and that interarrival times for interactive applications closely follow a constant plus exponential model. Half of the conversations are directed to a handful of networks, but the other half are directed to hundreds of networks. Many of these observations contradict commonly held beliefs regarding wide-area traffic.

Reference-contexts: No packet losses due to buffer overflows were detected during the UCB measurements. The packet loss rate induced by separate stress testing was less than 5% in the worst case. The USC data was collected using the NNStat program suite <ref> [Braden89] </ref> on a Sun SparcServer 4/490. The NNStat program uses the Sun gettimeofday () system call which has a 20-millisecond resolution. During similar measurements, we estimated the loss rate by sending a Poisson stream of ping packets. We observed that 0.6% of these packets were missing from the tape.

Reference-contexts: Table 1: Selected results. Previous traffic studies of TCP/IP have examined the statistics of the aggregated packet arrival process on local area networks [Jain86] [Gusella90] [Leland91], at border routers <ref> [Cceres89] </ref>, and inside a wide-area backbone [Heimlich89]. These studies have shown that packet interarrival times are not Poisson, but rather follow a packet-train model. The packet-train model has proven valuable in the design of packet routers [Feldmeier88] [Jain89].

Reference-contexts: Tracing Instrumentation and Packet Loss Rate The UCB data was collected with a Sun 3 workstation equipped with a microsecond timer <ref> [Danzig90] </ref>. The resulting time stamp resolution was 10 microseconds. The workstation ran a modified Unix kernel with a circular buffer big enough to hold 128 fullsize Ethernet packets. A dedicated user program transferred trace records from this buffer to tape.

Reference-contexts: For legibility, we present only UCB data in the body of the paper. Appendix 1 contains representative figures comparing data from the three sites. Additional data can be found in <ref> [Danzig91] </ref>. One does need to account for the differences in traffic breakdown when generating the actual sequence of conversations to simulate. 2.5. Traffic Pattern Analyzer We wrote a traffic pattern analyzer to reduce the raw packet trace data and produce the statistics presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Current practice is to use FTP and TELNET sources, where FTP sources send huge quantities of data in one direction and TELNET sources send a Poisson stream of small packets in one or both directions <ref> [Demers89] </ref> [Rama90]. Current practice ignores the distribution of number of bytes transmitted, the bidirectionality of bulk traffic sources, and the duration of interactive connections. Future broadband wide-area networks will probably transfer large amounts of data and carry a mix of traffic currently not found on the Internet. <p> Traffic Breakdown For lack of a more accurate model, previous studies that simulate flow control, congestion control, multiple access protocols, and traffic dynamics in general have been forced to assume a rather simple traffic model <ref> [Demers89] </ref>, [Floyd91], [Wilder91], [Will91], [Zhang90], [Zhang91]. These studies either use a continuous bulk transfer or an arbitrary mix of bulk and interactive traffic. <p> Bulk Data Transfer Many simulation studies commonly overestimate the amount of data sent by bulk data transfer applications such as FTP. Transfer sizes usually range from 80K to 2M bytes, or simply continue to the end of the simulation run <ref> [Demers89] </ref> [Floyd91] [Wilder91] [Zhang90] [Zhang91]. conversations transfer less than 10K bytes. We think this observation is correlated with the observation made in [Ouster85] that most files are small. <p> In most traffic models used in existing simulations or testbed studies, conversations are assumed to last anywhere from 500 seconds, 600 seconds, to keep on forever <ref> [Demers89] </ref> [Mankin90] [Floyd91] [Wilder91] [Zhang91]. conversations is highly variable. This fact, along with the small number of packets per conversation (see Figure 2b), might influence steady state feedback assumptions, as well as per packet processing time with respect to gateway algorithms. <p> Traffic Flow Most simulations on gateway queueing such as <ref> [Demers89] </ref>, [Floyd91], and [Zhang90] have assumed unidirectional data flow. Figure 5 shows that a large percentage of traffic, both interactive and bulk, is bidirectional. Simulations should generate traffic in both directions.

Small packets, short conversations, and birectional flow all contribute to the traffic dynamics of the internetwork. These characteristics of current internetwork traffic could affect traffic segregation and oscillation findings <ref> [Floyd91] </ref> [Wilder91] [Zhang91]. 3.5. Wide-Area Network Locality Mogul reports strong locality of reference between pairs of hosts on a local area network [Mogul91]. This locality of reference means that certain hosts communicate more with one another than with other hosts.

Reference-contexts: The problem of multiplexing application datagram traffic over wide-area virtual circuits reappears with the advent of highspeed Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. Assuming the existence of a reservation scheme for handling the requirements of multimedia traffic <ref> [Ferrari90] </ref>, we still have to accommodate the dynamics and requirements of traditional datagram traffic. When a datagram arrives at an ATM gateway, it needs to be routed onto an appropriate virtual circuit. If such a circuit doesnt exist, data transmission must wait until one is established.

In the packet-train model, a stream of packets is broken up into trains. Two consecutive trains are delimited by a MAIG (maximum allowable inter-car gap). The MAIG is usually chosen to encompass 90 percent of all interarrival gaps.
