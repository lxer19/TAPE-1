Title: Four Challenges for a Computational Model of Legal Precedent

Abstract: Identifying the open research issues in a field is a necessary step for progress in that field. This paper describes four open research problems in computational models of precedent-based legal reasoning: relating case representation to precedent use; modeling the selection and construction of both arguments based on pairwise case comparison and multiple-precedent arguments; modeling the process whereby purposes, policies, and principles are used in case similarity assessment; and extending the applicability of precedents to tasks other than classification.

Reference-contexts: Nearest-neighbor models of precedent typically place little emphasis on explanation generation. An alternative approach that emphasizes explanation more strongly is the 6 dimensional approach exemplified by HYPO <ref> (Ashley, 1990) </ref>. The dimensional approach uses knowledge of the factors that tend to establish or negate a predicate and the magnitude of these factors in precedents and new cases.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Ashley has identified a number of legal problem solving tasks that involve case reuse rather than classification <ref> (Ashley, 1993) </ref>. An initial step towards extending the use of precedents beyond classification was taken in the CHIRON project (Sanders, 1991), which explored the use of precedents to guide tax planning. In CHIRON, precedents were used to evaluate prototypical transaction plans and suggest possible plan adaptations.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a system whose representation language is limited in the aspects of a case that it can express will be able to generate 3 only a correspondingly limited set of distinct explanations. First-order predicate calculus, McCarty's Language for Legal Discourse (McCarty, 1989), and the relational representations of BRAMBLE <ref> (Bellairs, 1989) </ref> and GREBE (Branting, 1991b) have a high degree of extensibility and expressiveness. However, there are three distinct costs associated with such highly expressive case representation formalisms. The first is the cost of case matching. <p> Two cases are structurally similar if "objects in the cases can be placed into correspondence so that relations also correspond" (Holyoak and Thagard, 1989). This approach, which was originally suggested as a model of precedential legal reasoning in (Winston, 1980), was used in BRAMBLE <ref> (Bellairs, 1989) </ref>. The motivation for use of structural similarity as a similarity metric is the hypothesis that relevant similarity between cases is a function of "relational commonalities independent of the objects in which those relations are embedded." (Gentner, 1989).

Reference-contexts: custom, historical development of legal doctrine, or models of social justice in the assessment of relevant similarity, and therefore none can produce arguments that appeal to these factors. 11 A preliminary step towards incorporating purposes, policies, and princi-ples into precedent-based reasoning was taken by Berman and Hafner, who showed in <ref> (Berman and Hafner, 1993) </ref> how to associate purposes with dimensions in a manner that permits much more idiomatic and persuasive legal arguments. However, techniques for incorporating purposes, policies, or principles into the case similarity metric itself are largely unexplored.

Reference-contexts: First-order predicate calculus, McCarty's Language for Legal Discourse (McCarty, 1989), and the relational representations of BRAMBLE (Bellairs, 1989) and GREBE <ref> (Branting, 1991b) </ref> have a high degree of extensibility and expressiveness. However, there are three distinct costs associated with such highly expressive case representation formalisms. The first is the cost of case matching. <p> Moreover, different knowledge enterers often chose to represent identical facts differently, creating the danger of inconsistent analyses of equivalent cases. Limitations in problem formulation, rather than problem solving, prevented GREBE from being usable in any practical setting <ref> (Branting, 1991b) </ref>. Charting a course between the Scylla of representational inadequacy and the Charybdis of intractability in systems for precedent-based reasoning will require a much deeper analysis of the interplay between representation and performance than has been performed in past work.

Reference-contexts: However, there has been a growing awareness that not all legal problem solving consists of classification. For example, Clark and Economides argue in <ref> (Clark and Economides, 1991) </ref> that attorneys typically spend most of their time in activities such as advising, negotiating, planning transactions, and drafting documents, which do not necessarily entail classification. Similarly, Ashley has identified a number of legal problem solving tasks that involve case reuse rather than classification (Ashley, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Under this framework, precedents are essential to the analysis of open-textured legal predicates when legal rules "run out," i.e., when there is uncertainty whether a legal predicate is satisfied by a particular set of facts <ref> (Gardner, 1987) </ref>. 4 One of the earliest expressions of the insight that many types of legal problem solving were reducible to classification was Meldman's definition of legal analysis as "the logical derivation of a legal conclusion from a particular factual situation in the light of some body of legal doctrine."

Reference-contexts: The motivation for use of structural similarity as a similarity metric is the hypothesis that relevant similarity between cases is a function of "relational commonalities independent of the objects in which those relations are embedded." <ref> (Gentner, 1989) </ref>. Like the nearest neighbor model and the dimensional models, the structural model of precedent presupposes pairwise comparison between a new case and individual precedent cases. However, at least two kinds of precedential arguments requiring multiple precedents can be identified.

Reference-contexts: A third approach uses a structural representation of case facts and uses structural similarity between case facts as a similarity metric.

McCarty's prototype-plus-deformation model <ref> (McCarty and Sridharan, 1982) </ref> provides a preliminary model of multiple-precedent arguments of the first type.

Typical formulations among legal scholars are that two cases share relevant 10 similarity with respect to a legal category if the "principle of policy" (Boden--heimer, 1974), "rationale" <ref> (Murray, 1982) </ref>, or "justification" (Raz, 1979) for membership in the category by the first applies as well to the second.
