Abstract: Hyper-redundant manipulators present an alternative to conventional 6 DOF manipulators for inspection, space, and medical applications. The additional degrees of freedom facilitate obstacle avoidance and allow tasks to be performed even if some of the actuators fail. In this paper we consider hyper-redundant manipulators that are actuated discretely, e.g. using two-state actuators or motors with finite resolution. The inverse kinematics problem for a discretely actuated manipulator is intrinsically different from the one for its continuously actuated counterpart. We present a framework for the discussion of the discretely actuated case and propose an algorithm for the inverse kinematics. The algorithm generates solutions in linear time with respect to the number of manipulator actuators, as opposed to the exponential time required by brute force search.

More recent developments include a prototype of a Hyper-redundant Active Endo-scope for use in remote and minimally invasive surgery [2], and a prototype with 12 degrees of freedom that is currently being tested at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for inspection tasks on space stations [3].

Reference-contexts: An advantage of this type of manipulator is that it offers excellent static stability. Different candidate topologies and their suitability for applications in space have been discussed extensively, e.g. <ref> [6, 7, 8] </ref>. One approach to the inverse kinematics of general macroscopically-serial manipulators is to prescribe their shape using backbone curves ([9, 10] and references therein).
