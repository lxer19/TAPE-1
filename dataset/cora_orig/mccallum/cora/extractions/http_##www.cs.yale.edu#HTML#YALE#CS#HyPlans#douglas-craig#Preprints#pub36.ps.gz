Abstract: Flame sheet problems are on the natural route to the numerical solution of multidimensional flames, which, in turn, are important in many engineering applications. In order to model the flame structure more accurately, we use the vorticity-velocity formulation of the fluid flow equations instead of the streamfunction-vorticity approach. The numerical solution of the resulting nonlinear coupled elliptic partial differential equations involves a pseudo transient process and a steady state Newton iteration. Rather than working with dimensionless variables, we introduce scale factors that can yield significant savings in the execution time. In this context, we also investigate the applicability and performance of several multigrid methods, focusing on nonlinear damped Newton multigrid, using either one way or correction schemes.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Recent advances in the development of computational algorithms and supercomputers have provided new extremely powerful tools with which to investigate chemically reacting systems that were computationally infeasible only a few years ago (see [1], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], and [4]). The difficulties associated with solving high heat release combustion problems stem from the large number of dependent unknowns, the nonlinear character of the governing partial differential equations and the different length scales present in the problem. <p> To further simplify the governing equations, one neglects thermal diffusion effects, assumes constant heat capacities and Fick's law for the ordinary mass diffusion velocities, and takes all the Lewis numbers equal to unity <ref> [2] </ref>. With these approximations, the energy equation and the major species equations take on the same mathematical form and by introducing Schvab-Zeldovich variables, one can derive a source free convective-diffusive equation for a single conserved scalar. <p> Hence, a brief discussion on the various formulations of the Navier-Stokes equations in the context of laminar combustion problems is of order. The first numerical solution of two dimensional axisymmetric laminar diffusion flames was obtained using the streamfunction-vorticity formulation <ref> [2] </ref>. This approach is attractive for three reasons: 1. It eliminates the coupling associated with the presence of the pressure in the momentum equations. 2. It reduces the number of equations to be solved by one. 3. It also has the important advantage that continuity is explicitly satisfied locally. <p> A source free convective-diffusive equation for a conserved scalar is solved coupled together with the flow field equations and the temperature and major stable species profiles in the system can be recovered from the conserved scalar (see <ref> [2] </ref>, [19], and references therein). <p> Hence, in this model, the determination of all the transport coefficients is reduced to the specification of a transport relation for the viscosity and we use the same power law as the one given in <ref> [2] </ref>. We also note that, due to the high temperature gradients present in the system, the viscosity derivatives in the right hand side of the vorticity transport equation (2) can not be neglected. <p> A solution is first obtained on an initial coarse grid. Additional mesh points are then adaptively inserted in regions of high physical activity by equidistributing weight functions of the local gradient and curvature of the numerical solution <ref> [2] </ref>, which yields a 129 fi 161 grid. To verify the grid independence of the solution, we refined this grid to 257 fi 219 points. <p> The Jacobian matrix J (U n ) is computed numerically using vector function evaluations and the grid nodes are split into nine independent groups which are perturbed simultaneously (see <ref> [2] </ref> for more details). Selected cases were rerun with a more stringent convergence tolerance of 10 6 , without any significant changes in the numerical solution.

INTRODUCTION Recent advances in the development of computational algorithms and supercomputers have provided new extremely powerful tools with which to investigate chemically reacting systems that were computationally infeasible only a few years ago (see [1], [2], <ref> [3] </ref>, and [4]). The difficulties associated with solving high heat release combustion problems stem from the large number of dependent unknowns, the nonlinear character of the governing partial differential equations and the different length scales present in the problem. <p> However, the specification of boundary conditions meets with difficulties when one attempts to specify vorticity boundary values. In particular, a zero vorticity boundary condition at the inlet of the computational domain results in a rough approximation of the true solution, thus severely altering the resulting velocity field <ref> [3] </ref>. On the other hand, the specification of vorticity boundary values in terms of the streamfunction requires the discretization of second order derivatives, thus yielding off diagonal terms in the Jacobian matrix which result in having to solve severely ill conditioned linear systems. <p> Alternatively, a primitive form of the Navier-Stokes equations has been recently implemented for several axisymmetric laminar diffusion flames (see <ref> [3] </ref> and [4]). In this approach, the velocity field is computed using the momentum equations and the pressure field is recovered from the continuity equation.

Reference-contexts: The numerical techniques presented in this paper, however, also apply to combustion problems with finite rate chemistry <ref> [9] </ref>. We note that a flame sheet model adds only one field to the hydrodynamic fields that describe the underlying flow. A detailed kinetics model adds as many fields as species considered in the kinetic mechanism, each with its own coupled conservation equation. <p> However, when the function evaluations are expensive, the damped Newton multilevel method usually produces an approximate solution faster than FAS. In a typical diffusion flame problem with finite rate chemistry <ref> [9] </ref>, the function evaluations are horrendously expensive, so we did not explore FAS. For a flame sheet problem solved using FAS, see [24]. 5. NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section, we present several numerical results obtained on an IBM RISC System/6000 (model 560).

Reference-contexts: Since being studied as a means of obtaining an approximate solution to use as an initial iterate for a one dimensional detailed kinetics computation in <ref> [10] </ref>, flame sheets have been routinely employed to initialize multidimensional diffusion flames. In x2, a comparison of three possible formulations of the problem is presented, including the governing equations and boundary conditions.

Reference-contexts: A review of incompressible fluid flow computations using this formulation is well documented in [15]. The vorticity-velocity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations has been recently extended to two and three dimensional compressible flows and implemented for the numerical solution of flame sheet problems (see <ref> [16] </ref> and [17]). As motivated in these references, a vorticity-velocity formulation allows replacement of the first order continuity equation with additional second order equations. <p> Another important attractive feature of the vorticity-velocity formulation is that the governing equations can be discretized on a nonstaggered grid, thus allowing the implementation of a multigrid algorithm at a relatively low overhead in additional programming (see <ref> [16] </ref>, [17], and [18]). The flame sheet governing equations consist of the conservation of total mass, momentum and a conserved scalar equation. The conservation of total mass and momentum equations constitute the flow field problem and are formulated using the vorticity-velocity formulation of the compressible axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. <p> The linear system (5) is inverted at each Newton step through an inner iteration. This inner iteration may consist of either the Bi-CGSTAB algorithm [21] or a restarted version of GMRES [22] combined with a Gauss-Seidel (GS) left preconditioner. This choice is motivated in <ref> [16] </ref> through various numerical simulations of flame sheet problems. Although a single Bi-CGSTAB/GS iteration requires approximately 1.5 times more time than an average GMRES/GS iteration, both algorithms yield total execution times which are in general within a few percent of each other. <p> The convergence of the inner iteration is based on the norm of the left preconditioned linear residual using an absolute tolerance equal to one-tenth of the Newton tolerance. Such termination criterion brings enough information on the update vector U n back to the Newton iteration (see <ref> [16] </ref> for more details). Due to the nonlinearity of the original problem, a pseudo transient process is used to produce a parabolic in time problem and bring the starting estimate into the convergence domain of the steady Newton method.

First, as motivated in <ref> [17] </ref>, the vorticity inlet boundary condition is discretized using the vorticity values at the first two lines of the computational domain.

Reference-contexts: A source free convective-diffusive equation for a conserved scalar is solved coupled together with the flow field equations and the temperature and major stable species profiles in the system can be recovered from the conserved scalar (see [2], <ref> [19] </ref>, and references therein). <p> The inlet velocity profile of the fuel and oxidizer are a plug flow of 35cm/s. This yields a typical value for the Reynolds number of 550. Further, the flame length is approximately L f =3cm <ref> [19] </ref> and the length of the computational domain is set to L =30cm. <p> The narrowness of the Gaussian profile has a relevant influence on the calculated flame length, so that its parameters have to be determined appropriately <ref> [19] </ref>. The boundary conditions are summarized in Table 1. Finally, we note that the use of the definition of the vorticity (1) for the vorticity outlet boundary condition does not yield any relevant changes in the computed solution. 3. <p> By comparing our numerical solutions with a primitive variable solution of the same problem <ref> [19] </ref>, we found that these two boundary conditions exerted a strong influence on the overall accuracy of the numerical solution.

Reference-contexts: This yields a coarsest grid of 17 fi 21 points. It is worthwhile to note that the use of even coarser grids in these problems meets with difficulties since the calculated flame speeds become excessively large due to the influence of numerical diffusion and/or conduction (see <ref> [25] </ref>) and the Newton iteration (5) fails to converge. In the one way nonlinear multigrid approach, we solve the nonlinear problem F (U ) = 0 in one cycle, starting at the coarsest level and ending at the finest.
