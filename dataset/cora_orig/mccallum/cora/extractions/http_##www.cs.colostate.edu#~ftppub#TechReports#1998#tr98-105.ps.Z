Reference-contexts: Channel allocation schemes are of two types: fixed (or static) <ref> [7, 1] </ref> and dynamic [10, 9, 2]. Fixed channel allocation techniques assign channels to cells according to some a-priori known reuse patterns and these assignments don't change with time or load in the system. These techniques are simple to implement and have negligible channel acquisition time.

Reference-contexts: N borrow + 3~ 2 mN + ~ 3 (3ff + 4)N We can easily estimate the message complexity and the channel acquisition time for 3 distinct channel acquisition schemes available in the literature, e.g., the basic search scheme [4], the basic update scheme [4], and the advanced update scheme <ref> [3] </ref> and the results are summarized in the Table 1.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of a hybrid scheme, that attempts to combine the advantages of the static and the dynamic schemes is to minimize the call drop rate and at the same time minimize the channel acquisition time. There exist a number of such hybrid schemes in the literature <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> We denote the set of Ids of all cells in the interference re gion of cell i by I N i . 2.2. Distributed Channel Allocation Schemes Distributed dynamic channel allocation scheme can be categorized into update based schemes and search based schemes. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Dong and Lai have presented representative scheme for each approach, namely the basic update scheme and the basic search scheme. In the basic search scheme a MSS needing a channel searches its interference region for an available channel. <p> ~ 3 Fraction of channel acquisitions by a cell in the borrowing mode using search scheme (~ 1 + ~ 2 + ~ 3 = 1). n p Number of primary cells of a channel r which are in interference region of any cell c (used for Advance update scheme <ref> [4] </ref>). We make the following observations: * When a local channel is acquired, the cell has to exchange N borrow ACQUISITION messages and N borrow RELEASE messages. <p> 1)~ 3 gT and the average message complexity as 2~ 1 N borrow + 3~ 2 mN + ~ 3 (3ff + 4)N We can easily estimate the message complexity and the channel acquisition time for 3 distinct channel acquisition schemes available in the literature, e.g., the basic search scheme <ref> [4] </ref>, the basic update scheme [4], and the advanced update scheme [3] and the results are summarized in the Table 1. <p> average message complexity as 2~ 1 N borrow + 3~ 2 mN + ~ 3 (3ff + 4)N We can easily estimate the message complexity and the channel acquisition time for 3 distinct channel acquisition schemes available in the literature, e.g., the basic search scheme <ref> [4] </ref>, the basic update scheme [4], and the advanced update scheme [3] and the results are summarized in the Table 1. <p> Our proposed scheme also overcomes one problem associated with the advanced update scheme of <ref> [4] </ref>. The advanced update scheme saves on messages by sending request messages only to cells which are primary with respect to a cell (N P (c; r)), but this can result in no two cells in the same interference region obtaining a channel and unfairness.

Reference-contexts: In order to reuse radio spectrum, the current wireless systems use a cellular architecture; the geographical area is divided into several coverage areas called cells, and the radio spectrum is divided into a number of wireless communication channels using combination of frequency division, time division, and code division techniques <ref> [5] </ref>. A channel r can be used by a cell c without any interference if it is not concurrently used by any other cell within the minimum reuse distance of cell c.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic allocation schemes improves bandwidth utilization and minimizes call drops at the cost of increased channel acquisition time and additional message complexity (arbitration between cells in a neighborhood needs exchange of control messages and hence extra time). Fixed channel allocation schemes work well at uniform loads <ref> [6] </ref>. This is because the assignments of channels to cells is made in such a way that a channel can be reused in other cells at distances greater than the interference region of a particular cell. This allocation does not change over time.

Reference-contexts: These scenarios are not possible in our scheme since the request is sent to all neighbors. Our adaptive scheme also compares well with the advanced search scheme of <ref> [8] </ref> which uses the concept of the Allocated channels. The scheme of [8] adapts to load in that it allows a cell to keep a channel once it is allocated to it; thus, at transient high loads a cell can satisfy requests from its allocated set. <p> These scenarios are not possible in our scheme since the request is sent to all neighbors.
