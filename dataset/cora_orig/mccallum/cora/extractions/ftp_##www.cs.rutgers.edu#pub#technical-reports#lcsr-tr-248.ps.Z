Abstract: Let G = (V; E) be an undirected graph. Given an odd number k = 2l + 1, a matching M is said to be k-optimal if it does not admit an augmenting path of length less than or equal to k. We prove jMj jM fl j(l+1)=(l+2), where M fl is a maximum cardinality matching. If M is not already (k + 2)-optimal, using M, in O(jEj) time we compute a (k + 2)-optimal matching. We show that starting with any matching, repeated k-optimizations result in an optimal matching in O( approximation scheme extends to the minimum weight perfect matching, and the minimum weight uncapacitated perfect 2-matching problems over complete graphs, and complete bipartite graphs with edge weights of one and two. In particular we obtain a fast approximation algorithm for the traveling salesman problem over complete graphs with edge weights of one and two. p

Reference-contexts: The characterization of the maximum cardinality matching (Corollary 1) is also known to be generalizable to the weighted versions, e.g. see the survey paper of Berge <ref> [2] </ref>. The notion of k-optimality 13 and its properties are certainly worthy of further study for many combinatorial problems, e.g. the minimum weight perfect matching problem, the maximum flow problem, as well as the maximum cardinality matching problem itself, in the hope of deriving faster exact algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, successive approximation in O ( p n m) time results in an optimal solution. 2 Consider the traveling salesman problem, TSP, for the graph G stated above.

Reference-contexts: A matching M is a subset of E such that no two edges are incident to a common vertex. The polynomial time solubility of the problem of computing a maximum cardinality matching was established by Edmonds <ref> [4] </ref>. An O ( p n m) time algorithm for the bipartite case was given by Hopcroft and Karp [8], and an algorithm of the same complexity for the general case was given by Micali and Vazirani [11].

Reference-contexts: Acknowledgments. The first author wishes to thank Professor Karp for raising the question of the existence of approximation algorithms, for the minimum weight perfect matching problem, over complete graphs with edge weights of one and two <ref> [9] </ref>. This question motivated the present paper.

Reference-contexts: In view of our results this expected behavior becomes more intuitive. It should be mentioned that the notion of k-optimality is not new and in fact has been defined for the traveling salesman problem with general weights, e.g. see <ref> [10] </ref>. The characterization of the maximum cardinality matching (Corollary 1) is also known to be generalizable to the weighted versions, e.g. see the survey paper of Berge [2].

Reference-contexts: This algorithm can be viewed as a realization of the algorithm of Hopcroft and Karp, and has some common features with the algorithm of Micali and Vazirani (which itself is a realization of Hopcroft and Karp algorithm), but is simpler. Motwani <ref> [12] </ref> has shown that for random graphs the algorithm of Micali and Vazirani has expected running time of O (m). In view of our results this expected behavior becomes more intuitive.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1. (Berge [1], Norman and Rabin <ref> [13] </ref>) A matching M is optimal if and only if there is no augmenting path relative to M . Definition 1. A matching M is said to be k-optimal, k = 2l + 1, if there does not exist an augmenting path of length less than or equal to k.

Reference-contexts: For example while it can be shown that in an undirected graph G, the problem of testing the existence of a perfect 2-matching free of 2 cycles, is reducible to the problem of computing a maximum matching in another graph (see <ref> [14] </ref>, Problem 13, Page 245), for the purpose of approximation, such reductions appear to be fruitless. 6. Concluding Remarks.

Reference-contexts: solution in O (tm) time. 2 At the cost of more computation, e.g. the computation of the optimal perfect 2-matching free of two cycles, or free of triangles, it is possible to obtain better approximate solutions for the TSP with edge weights of one and two, see Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [15] </ref>. It should be mentioned that the task of designing approximation schemes for these restricted 2-matching problems appears to be more difficult than the uncapacitated case considered in this paper, and interesting in their own right.
