Reference-contexts: Subsequently, Agarwal, Sharir, and Toledo <ref> [1] </ref> gave an algorithm that achieved fi (d) = O (d 3 log d) and ff (d) = 1=2. All these algorithms are quite complex and require many oracle calls, even for small d.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present a two-dimensional weighted version of the multidimensional search technique of Megiddo [4, 7, 9]. The result has applications to a class of two-dimensional convex optimization problems <ref> [2, 3, 5, 6, 11] </ref>. We need to present some background before stating our result precisely. Let fl R d be convex and let h : R d ! R be an affine function. <p> Let S be a set on which a weight function w : S ! R + has been defined. For S 0 S we write w (S 0 ) to denote P s2S 0 w (s). The following result is known <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 1 For each d 0, there exist constants fi (d) and ff (d), ff 1=2 and an algorithm Weighted-Search with the following property. <p> Supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-9211262. 1 Agarwala and Fernandez-Baca <ref> [2] </ref> gave two algorithms for this problem, one of which achieved fi (d) = 2 d 1 and ff (d) = 12=24 2 d1 , the other achieved fi (d) = 2 (60 d1 ) and ff (d) = 1=12.

The result has applications to a class of two-dimensional convex optimization problems [2, 3, 5, 6, 11]. We need to present some background before stating our result precisely. Let fl R d be convex and let h : R d ! R be an affine function. <p> that w (H 0 ) w (H )=2. (For example, if fl lies in the quadrant described by y &lt; b fl and x &gt; a fl , then we resolve fh i 2 H + : (b fl b i + c i )=a i a fl g; see <ref> [9] </ref> for details.) In either case, we resolve H 0 H such that w (H 0 ) (1=2)(W=2 w (H 0 )). Furthermore, p fl can be found in O (m) time by adapting a technique due to Megiddo [10] as described in the next section.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, p fl can be found in O (m) time by adapting a technique due to Megiddo <ref> [10] </ref> as described in the next section. <p> Euclidean plane, we have fi (2) = 3 and the weight resolved is at least (1=2)(W=2 w (H 0 )) + w (H 0 )=2 = W=4 giving us ff (2) = 1=4 with O (n) additional work. 3 Finding p fl We rely on an idea introduced by Megiddo <ref> [10] </ref> who gave an algorithm for the case where W N and W P correspond to unweighted medians. Like Megiddo, we use a line query algorithm which finds the position of the corresponding p fl with respect to any straight line in O (m) time. <p> Hence these lines can be discarded and we have a similar problem with 7jRj=8 lines.
