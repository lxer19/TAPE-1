Abstract: We present alternative designs for efficiently supporting multicast for mobile hosts on the Internet. Methods for separately supporting multicasting and mobility along with their possible interactions are briefly described, and then various solutions to the combined problem are explored. We examine three different multicast delivery mechanisms and compare them based on their efficiency and impact on host protocol software.

Reference-contexts: A MH, on the other hand, attaches itself to various networks, called foreign networks, whose network addresses will differ from the one indicated by its unique home address. IP routing however insists on delivering datagrams for the MH to the home network. On the draft standard for mobile IP <ref> [1] </ref>, this problem is solved by having a router on the home network of the MH, called the home agent (HA), and the router on the foreign network to which the MH is currently attached, called the foreign agent (FA), cooperate.

Reference-contexts: Since the MH may move outside the FAs area at any time, there is no de-registration procedure. Instead, information on visiting MHs is deleted from FA tables if renewal registrations are not received periodically. IP Multicasting IP multicasting is based on the concept of the host group <ref> [2] </ref>: a dynamic set of hosts identified by a single, class D, IP address. A host can join or leave a group at any time, in order to start or stop receiving datagrams sent to the group. Sending datagrams to a group is not limited to group members. <p> Local Multicasting Mechanisms Locating hosts belonging to multicast groups is the task of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [2] </ref>. Each local network that supports multicasting designates one multicast router (MR) as the group manager. This router periodically sends queries for group membership in its local area, and the attached hosts reply with reports identifying the groups that they participate in.

Reference-contexts: Since IGMP detects implicitly that a previously present group has no more local members, multicast datagrams are delivered to networks without any recipients for a period, called the leave latency. To avoid it, the draft standard for IGMP v2 <ref> [3] </ref> defines a leave group message: when a host leaves a group for which it was the last to send a report, it sends a leave group message.

Reference-contexts: Global Multicasting Mechanisms Delivering multicast datagrams to routers serving the corresponding group members requires global router cooperation. The earliest routing mechanism was the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [4] </ref>. With DVMRP each router keeps track of the best paths to the sources of multicast datagrams. Whenever a multicast is received, if it arrived via the best path to its source, it is forwarded through all other interfaces of the router, else it is discarded.

Reference-contexts: These tunnels are virtual links, and the collection of multicast aware areas connected by them is a virtual network known as the MBone <ref> [5] </ref>. In IP, datagram delivery is limited by the time to live (TTL) field, which is usually implemented as a limit to the hops that a datagram can make before it is discarded.

Reference-contexts: Since virtual links look like a single hop, MRs only forward multicast datagrams via tunnels if their TTL values exceed certain thresholds, to limit their scope. A second routing mechanism, the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) <ref> [6] </ref> protocol, is based on a link state algorithm, where each router floods information about its adjacent links, including its group membership list, throughout the network, so that all routers know the complete network topology and the location of all group members.

Reference-contexts: Again, to reduce routing table sizes, routers only keep track of networks, for both senders and receivers. With MOSPF, datagrams are only propagated when actually needed, a marked improvement over DVMRP. A third proposal, Core Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [7] </ref>, employs a single tree for each group rather than one tree per source. A router called the core is chosen in an ad hoc way for each group, and all multicast datagrams are initially sent there.

Reference-contexts: This enables the router to selectively unicast the multicast datagrams over the appropriate PtP links only. Transmission overhead can be reduced by employing this additional state to optimize IGMP behavior, by having each MH explicitly join and leave a group <ref> [9] </ref>. The router keeps track of the groups each MH is currently a member of, updating this state when a new join or leave message arrives, or when the MH leaves the area.

Reference-contexts: A final approach for receiving multicasts mixes tunneling from the HA with local multicast service from the FA <ref> [10] </ref>. The FA g a th e r s me m b e r sh i p information and arranges for unique tunnels to be set up for each group.
