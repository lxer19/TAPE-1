Abstract: This paper analyzes the variations of the relative positions of the parts composing an assembly when part dimensions span their specified tolerance zones. We focus on the simplified case where each part is modeled as a toleranced polygon defined as follows: each edge of this polygon is supported by a line of fixed orientation lying anywhere in a strip bounded by two extreme lines; these lines are themselves defined in a coordinate system attached to the part. The relative placements of parts in an assembly A are defined by spatial relations, such as edge e of part P is parallel to edge f of part Q, at distance d. We define the relative position of any two parts, P and Q, in an instance of A as the transform (a translation in our case) between the coordinate systems attached to these parts. Because of the possible variations in the geometry of each individual part, the relative position of P and Q is not constant over multiple instances of A. Hence, the question: What is the range of possible relative positions of any two parts in A? This paper describes an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. Experimental results obtained with an assembly sequence planner that incorporates this algorithm are also presented.

Reference-contexts: The above question is interesting in itself. However, it appeared to us as we were designing an assembly sequence planner with toleranced parts <ref> [2] </ref>. A building block of this planner is an algorithm computing how each part Q may possibly block the motion of another part P . The motion directions of P that are blocked by Q depend on the geometry of the two parts, as well as on their relative position. <p> For all valid geometries of the parts of A, we denote the locus of p j with reference to p i by W i;j . (Note that this region is slightly different from its homonym in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>.) We now present an algorithm to compute W i;j . 3 Overview of the Computation Given two parts P i and P j , let L i;j stand for the list of parts whose geometry influence their relative position. <p> Both characterizations can be derived from Proposition 3. 7 Experiments We have implemented the computations presented above. The corresponding software module is part of an assembly sequence planner that computes and queries a data structure called the strong non directional blocking graph (ndbg) <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. This data structure compactly represents the set of all extended translations of one part which are blocked by another part, for all pairs of parts in the assembly. Our implementation was done within the cas.cade environment of Matra-Datavision and consists of 11,000 lines of C++ code. <p> Thus, taking tolerances into account in assembly sequencing is of major practical importance. 8 Conclusion This paper gives an algorithm to compute the relative position of two parts in a toleranced assembly defined by a simple, yet non-trivial tolerance language.
