Abstract: Genesis and ATIS are being developed under the umbrella of the Intelligent Transportation Systems to facilitate various kinds of travel, including daily commuting to work via private/public transportation and visiting new places and points of attraction. Travelers are naturally mobile, and the most effective way to disseminate information to travelers is with wireless communications, which is being explored in the Genesis project in Minnesota. The travelers can use personal communication devices including pagers and portable computers (e.g. Apple Newton) to avail themselves of the ATIS services provided by Genesis. This extended abstract presents an overview of the goals and preliminary design of Genesis, illustrating the data-dissemination needs of ATIS. This paper describes the application domain rather than evaluating candidate solutions.

Reference-contexts: Trip status allows the user to receive travel duration, real-time, planned event, and bus exception advisories. Figure 2 shows the Trip Management function <ref> [1] </ref> in Genesis. Route optimization determines "favorable" routes from the vehicle's current position to a chosen destination. Route evaluation capabilities are also supported to evaluate a set of alternate routes between origin and destination, based on the current travel-time, congestion, restrictions and other attributes of the transportation network. <p> Figure 3 shows an operational view of Genesis <ref> [1] </ref> . The TMC is the communications control and computer center for managing traffic on Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Freeways. The TMC is equipped with video and radio monitoring and broadcasting equipment, as well as traffic management workstations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) is one facet of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) [2] , which is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of automobile travel. ATIS assists travelers with planning, perception, analysis and decision-making to improve the convenience, safety and efficiency of travel <ref> [4, 8, 3, 11, 5] </ref> . ATIS applications create a shared resource for efficient data integration and dissemination. As shown in Figure 1, ATIS obtains information from different sources, including traffic reports, scheduled traffic events, sensors, and maps. Periodic sensor data might lead to high update rates.

Several approaches to wireless communication are being explored, including Infrared and RF beacon technologies, FM sideband technology, Mobile satellite services, Cellular phone technology and Radio-Frequency (RF) data communication networks <ref> [5] </ref> . The user interface communicates with the user (traveller), accepting requests for service and delivering driving directions and other information. Direction screens present simple, highly stylized graphics that can be taken in at a glance.

Reference-contexts: A large number of travelers will query databases over the wireless communication channel to seek traffic information and driving advisories. Data dissemination is the core of ATIS. fl This paper is a shortened version of the paper which appeared in the NSF MOBIDATA Workshop <ref> [6] </ref> on Mobile and Wireless Information Systems, Nov. 1994.

Reference-contexts: Efficient wireless communication architectures and technologies need to be explored to support full-scale ATIS features. Communication overhead, caching strategies, data currency, scalability, computer cost and service charge, etc., need to be carefully evaluated in designing ATIS. In addition, efficient routing algorithms <ref> [9, 7, 10] </ref> should be investigated for minimum travel time (or other selectable criteria) that takes into account current traffic conditions and traffic network travel times. 6 ATIS is a very promising application requiring wireless data dissemination.
