Reference-contexts: From such traces the possible pass observables are extracted. Unfortunately, we cannot ensure that we find possible pass observables, because this problem is equivalent to the reachability problem of turing machines <ref> [BZ83] </ref> which is not decidable. We search the required observables by simulating the SDL description and the MSC in parallel. There exist several search methods like depth and breadth search. Breadth search can not applied because it is impossible to store all possible states of the SDL system 4 .

Reference-contexts: When 2 they are extended with states also test purposes concerning the flow of control can be described [GR89]. The introduction of parameters and variables in MSCs will make it possible to describe data flow. For the specification of the IUT SDL <ref> [CCI88] </ref> is chosen. The next section will present the SAMSTAG (Sdl And Msc baSed Test cAse Gen- eration) method. The SAMSTAG method interprets SDL as LTS and test purposes are described as FSMs, i.e. an MSC is transformed into an FSM. <p> The tool is implemented on Sun workstations. Its inputs are MSC/PR [CCI92] and SDL/PR <ref> [CCI88] </ref> descriptions, and its output is a TTCN/MP description [ISO92b]. Front- and backends of the tool are commercial SDL, MSC and TTCN editors. 5 Conclusions A test generation methodology has been presented which is totally in line with current practical testing approaches and [ISO92a].

Reference-contexts: When an IUT passes a test case (gets a pass verdict) then it has fulfilled the test purposes and did not show a behaviour contradicting the specification. For the description of the test purposes MSCs <ref> [CCI92, GGR93] </ref> are used. In their simplest form they are able to describe the flow of signals very well. When 2 they are extended with states also test purposes concerning the flow of control can be described [GR89]. <p> The tool is implemented on Sun workstations. Its inputs are MSC/PR <ref> [CCI92] </ref> and SDL/PR [CCI88] descriptions, and its output is a TTCN/MP description [ISO92b].

Reference-contexts: The presented method can easily be adopted to other description techniques and is therefore not restricted to SDL and MSC at all. For further details we refer the reader to <ref> [GHN93] </ref> or [NGH93].

Reference-contexts: The resulting test case can be seen as a tree, where the nodes are input and output events of the tester. Figure 1 shows the dynamic part of a test case for the Inres protocol <ref> [Hog91] </ref>, in which it is tested if the Initiator can establish a connection after a third CR (Connection Request). Every path of the tree, from the root to a leaf node is associated with a test verdict. We call these paths observables.

Reference-contexts: of the paper is the result of an analysis of the current theoretical approaches to testing, the approach taken in 'Conformance Testing Methodology and Framework' [ISO92a] and the testing methods applied in industry. 1.1 Drawbacks of current theoretical test methods Quite a number of test methods (some are discussed in <ref> [Hol91] </ref>) have been introduced in the last twenty years. In general they have the aim to prove behavioural equivalence of an Implementation Under Test (IUT) and its specification. In conformance testing only black box testing is considered. Current methods make a lot of assumptions on the IUT and its specification.

Reference-contexts: This part of the paper is the result of an analysis of the current theoretical approaches to testing, the approach taken in 'Conformance Testing Methodology and Framework' <ref> [ISO92a] </ref> and the testing methods applied in industry. 1.1 Drawbacks of current theoretical test methods Quite a number of test methods (some are discussed in [Hol91]) have been introduced in the last twenty years. <p> Furthermore, they allow to use a standardized FDT, since LOTOS, Estelle and SDL specifications are representable as LTS. The results of our test method are weaker than the results with current theoretical approaches, but the results of our method are in line with practical testing and <ref> [ISO92a] </ref>. When an IUT passes a test case (gets a pass verdict) then it has fulfilled the test purposes and did not show a behaviour contradicting the specification. For the description of the test purposes MSCs [CCI92, GGR93] are used. <p> The SDL specification describes the test architecture, i.e. the IUT, the test context and the tester processes. The tester processes, e.g. in the context of <ref> [ISO92a] </ref> upper and lower testers, are modelled as processes, which can send and receive every valid signal at any time. The MSC describes the test purpose, i.e. part of the signal exchange, which has to be performed in order to get a pass verdict. <p> Front- and backends of the tool are commercial SDL, MSC and TTCN editors. 5 Conclusions A test generation methodology has been presented which is totally in line with current practical testing approaches and <ref> [ISO92a] </ref>. The implemented tool SAMSTAG is able to generate a complete test case in TTCN from an SDL specification of the IUT and an MSC description of the test purpose.
