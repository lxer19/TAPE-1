Abstract: Introduction. In [1] it is claimed that the lack of comparative studies is one of the impediments for Formal Methods to gain broader acceptance in industry. The Forschungszentrum Informatik Karlsruhe (FZI), a technology transfer institute dedicated to bridge the gap between scientific research and industrial praxis, has therefore launched a large comparative study in formal software development, the case study production cell. The particular goal of this case study is to demonstrate the application of specification and verification methods to the same real world problem in order to provide insight to the benefits, the strengths, but also the limitations and weaknesses of particular methods and tools. The case study should help to gain a better understanding how crucial it is to select methods which are adequate for the problem. Up to now, more than a dozen of different methods has been applied to this problem. A short summary is given in [2], a comprehensive report describes them in more detail [3]. The case study still is open for new competitors. Anybody willing to participate is kindly requested to contact the authors in order to get a task description. Problem. The case study is a real world example: its task is to construct control software for a production cell as it can be found in a metal-processing plant near Karlsruhe.Several machines, operating concurrently have to be controlled using sensor values and actuator switches. It is a reactive system, as the software has to react on changes of the sensors permanently. In principle, the problem is a real-time problem, though, assuming that the reaction of the computer is quick enough in any situation simplifies the task to a causality based one. 1. The work reported here was done as contribution to the KorSo project and was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology deposit belt
