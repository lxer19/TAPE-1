Title: A Theory of Parallelism and the Case of VP Ellipsis  
Author: Jerry R. Hobbs and Andrew Kehler 
Address: 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International  
Abstract: We provide a general account of parallelism in discourse, and apply it to the special case of resolving possible readings for instances of VP ellipsis. We show how several problematic examples are accounted for in a natural and straightforward fashion. The generality of the approach makes it directly applicable to a variety of other types of el lipsis and reference.

Reference-contexts: By "sufficiently powerful" we mean that there must be a formalization of the notion of inference, strength of inference, and inferential independence, and there must be a reasonable knowledge base. In Hobbs and Kehler (forthcoming), we show how our approach can be realized within the "Interpretation as Abduction" framework <ref> (Hobbs et al., 1993) </ref>. There are at least two other treatments in which VP ellipsis is resolved through a more general system of determining discourse parallelism, namely, those of Prust (1992) and Asher (1993).

Reference-contexts: Lazy Pronouns "Lazy pronouns" can be accounted for similarly. In 7 This example is due to Prust (1992), whose approach successfully handles this example. (14) The man who gives his paycheck to his wife is wiser than the man who gives it to his mis tress. <ref> (Karttunen, 1969) </ref> the pronoun it does not refer to the first man's paycheck but the second's. In text, it normally requires an explicit, corefer-ring antecedent. However, the parallelism between the clauses licenses a sloppy reading via the similarity option.

Reference-contexts: There are at least two other treatments in which VP ellipsis is resolved through a more general system of determining discourse parallelism, namely, those of Prust (1992) and Asher (1993). Prust (1992) gives an account of parallelism developed within the context of the Linguistic Discourse Model theory <ref> (Scha and Polanyi, 1988) </ref>. Parallelism is computed by determining the "Most Specific Common Denominator" of a set of representations, which results from unifying the unifiable aspects of those representations and generalizing over the others. VP ellipsis is resolved as a side effect of this unification.
