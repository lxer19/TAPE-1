Abstract: A local rule theory is developed which shows that the self-assembly of icosahedral virus shells may depend on only the lower-level interactions of a protein subunit with its neighbors, i.e. local rules, rather than on larger structural building blocks. The local rule theory provides a framework for understanding the assembly of icosahedral viruses. These include both viruses that fall in the quasi-equivalence theory of Caspar and Klug and the polyoma virus structure, which violates quasi-equivalence and has puzzled researchers since it was first observed. Local rules are essentially templates for energetically favorable arrangements. The tolerance margins for these rules are investigated through computer simulations. When these tolerance margins are exceeded in a particular way, the result is a "spiraling" malformation that has been observed in nature.

Reference-contexts: In bacteriophage , mutations of the coat protein exist that form functional T = 4 shells [17]. Finally, the T = 7 bacteriophage P2 has a satellite virus P4 that forms T = 4 shells using the P2 coat protein by substituting a different scaffolding protein <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. 9 3.1.2 Example: T = 3 Rules Many viruses have T = 3 shells.

Reference-contexts: One of the most notable aspects of virus shells is their highly regular structure: they are generally spherical and possess strong symmetry properties. Almost all human viruses, and many plant and animal viruses, are icosahedral <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. These include the rhinovirus, poliovirus, and herpesvirus, all of which have rounded icosahedral shells. These shells are constructed of repeated protein subunits, or coat proteins, which surround their condensed DNA or RNA genomes. <p> Another common malformation of virus shells is the formation of open tubes. These can be viewed as planar sheets of hexamers which have been curved until two of their edges meet. This kind of malformation has been observed in many viruses, including SV40 <ref> [2] </ref> and bacteriophages and T4 [15]. The formation of these tubes may require some binding interactions between two conformations which are not allowed in the local rules.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a protein needs to know nothing about what is going on in the rest of the structure in order to form icosahedral shells. In particular, the local rule-based theory introduced by Berger et al. <ref> [3] </ref> showed that possible assembly pathways can be given that depend on only the interactions of a protein with its immediate neighbors, rather than on larger structural building blocks. This leads to simple, local rule theories that suffice to explain assembly. <p> A local rule theory can be divided into a combinatorial part, which says which conformations can bind to each other, and a numerical part, which gives the relative angles and 2 the lengths of these bonds. In <ref> [3] </ref>, two combinatorially different sets of local rules for the T = 7 shell are given (the T number classifies the combinatorial structure of the shell). One uses seven conformations of the coat protein; the other uses only four. <p> For a number of viruses, incorrect or malformed assemblages of coat protein subunits have been described, including tubular and spiral variants. The coat subunits in these structures are normal, but there have been errors in their interactions with each other [10, 18]. We have a computer simulation (see also <ref> [3] </ref>) which shows that if the local rules are distorted in certain ways, or if certain mistakes are made in the assembly process, spiral structures can form. Previous attempts at interfering with the infection process have mainly focused on interrupting infection by a fully-formed shell at the binding site. <p> Local rules for SV40 can be constructed that are not substantially different than for other icosahedral viruses. It could simply have six local rules (figure 16), one for each of its conformations, as described in Berger et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. For SV40, six protein conformations have been confirmed, but the binding interactions are more complicated than as indicated by the local rule theory [19]. 13 its conformation.

For example, the T = 1 shell of satellite tobacco necrosis virus <ref> [5] </ref> is typically viewed as an icosahedron, except that instead of having one protein at each vertex, it has a protein at each corner of each triangular face (figure 1b). The same structure can be redrawn by grouping the proteins at each vertex into pentamers, as in Figure 1c.

Reference-contexts: In icosahedral viruses this has been particularly difficult to explain because very often the same protein occurs in non-symmetric positions [25]. Previous attempts at explaining the formation of closed icosahedral shells from subunits have focused on the icosahedral symmetry, through the Caspar and Klug theory of quasi-equivalence <ref> [8] </ref>. This theory classifies icosahedral shells whose protein subunits all have very similar (quasi-equivalent) neighborhoods and form hexamers and pentamers in the virus shell. The general belief was that shells were formed by assembly of these pentamer and hexamer building blocks. <p> All the viruses discussed in this paper have what is called icosahedral structure. They are based on the icosahedron (figure 1a), a mathematical solid, and they have the same symmetry properties as the icosahedron.

Reference-contexts: Many of these viral shells are believed to assemble with only limited aid from cellular machinery; they appear to "self-assemble," or spontaneously polymerize and take shape, in the host cell environment.

SV40 is a 360-subunit spherical virus with a shell consisting entirely of pentamers, some of which contact five other pentamers and some of which contact six other pentamers (figure 15). This structure still has 5-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold symmetry and is therefore icosahedral. <p> SV40 has been considered an anomaly, because the theory of quasi-equivalence assumes that all icosahedral shells have exactly 12 equally-spaced pentavalent (i.e. have five neighboring capsomeres) pentamers and that all other subunits are packed into hexavalent hexamers.

These could be having a secondary effect which can be accounted for by the 8% tolerance margins of the local rule theory, described below. <p> In the alternate set of T = 7 rules, the hexamers are symmetric under rotations of 180 ffi . This is intriguing because the micrographs of P22 show near-symmetry of the hexamers under 180 ffi rotations <ref> [21] </ref>. It is possible that this alternate set of rules is responsible for determining the assembly of P22, and that the reason seven different conformations of the protein are observed is that functionally equivalent conformations in non-equivalent positions are responding to different stresses. <p> The double, directed edges could be simplified to either a single, directed or undirected, edge; we have drawn them as double edges so as to correspond to the known biological structure <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we further elaborate on the numerical parts of the local rules through computer experimentation. Local rule theories are not limited to viruses that conform to the theory of quasi-equivalence. Recently, investigators have discovered viruses with unusual icosahedral symmetries <ref> [19, 24, 20] </ref>, such as the polyomavirus, which causes tumors in mice. These have five-sided building blocks surrounded by six neighboring building blocks. Little is understood about the assembly of these "non-quasi-equivalent" viruses. <p> SV40 has been considered an anomaly, because the theory of quasi-equivalence assumes that all icosahedral shells have exactly 12 equally-spaced pentavalent (i.e. have five neighboring capsomeres) pentamers and that all other subunits are packed into hexavalent hexamers. Clearly this assumption does not hold for SV40. Research <ref> [19, 24, 20] </ref> on the structure of SV40 has focused on how pentamers could be hexavalent and on how the same protein could occupy very asymmetric environments.

Reference-contexts: At first glance, the assembly of the shells seems easy to understand, because the structure is so regular. In fact, it has been difficult to determine the actual pathway through which the subunits interact to form a closed shell composed of hundreds of subunits <ref> [25] </ref>. In icosahedral viruses this has been particularly difficult to explain because very often the same protein occurs in non-symmetric positions [25]. Previous attempts at explaining the formation of closed icosahedral shells from subunits have focused on the icosahedral symmetry, through the Caspar and Klug theory of quasi-equivalence [8]. <p> In fact, it has been difficult to determine the actual pathway through which the subunits interact to form a closed shell composed of hundreds of subunits <ref> [25] </ref>.

Previous attempts at explaining the formation of closed icosahedral shells from subunits have focused on the icosahedral symmetry, through the Caspar and Klug theory of quasi-equivalence [8]. <p> It was also generally believed that proteins took on only one conformation, particularly very stable proteins such as those that form virus shells. Recent evidence indicates that virus shell proteins in fact take on several conformations [14, 19, 21], as has been proposed by <ref> [7, 25] </ref>. This important observation informs the approach to virus shell assembly presented below. It is useful to consider what an individual protein "knows," from an information-theoretic point of view. It might appear that each protein needs to know something about the global structure.

Reference-contexts: Another well-studied class of icosahedral viruses are the T = 3 plant viruses [14, 16, 27]. Several theories for their assembly have been advanced <ref> [26, 28] </ref>. Although these T = 3 virus shells have three non-equivalent positions, the proteins in two of these positions assume quite similar conformations [28, 27]. These are labeled 1 in the graph representation in Figure 10, while proteins in the third position are labeled 2. <p> A set of rules can be extracted from this representation that permits both T = 3 and T = 1 shells (Figure 9). The coat proteins of many of these viruses can in fact form T = 1 shells <ref> [26] </ref>. However, as similarly noted by [28], if assembly is initiated by a structure containing a type 2 conformation, these will propagate during assembly to uniquely determine the T = 3 structure. The final set of local rules for T = 3 is given in Figure 11.

Reference-contexts: These proteins appear to be designed so that they can fit together in only one way to form a virus shell, thus corresponding to the set of rules in 8.

Reference-contexts: The local rules tell us that if we can interfere with a single binding interaction, the shells may not close. Recent experiments indicate that the subunit assembly process may be a sensitive locus for inhibitors of virus assembly <ref> [29] </ref>. 2 Icosahedral Structure One striking aspect of virus shells is their strong symmetry properties. All the viruses discussed in this paper have what is called icosahedral structure. They are based on the icosahedron (figure 1a), a mathematical solid, and they have the same symmetry properties as the icosahedron.

Reference-contexts: The final set of local rules for T = 3 is given in Figure 11. This set of rules has two conformations, 1 and 2, and determines the T = 3 structure given in Figure 12. The structure of the bacteriophage MS2 was recently determined <ref> [30] </ref>. This bacteriophage has a coat protein which is different structurally from any previously known viral coat protein. It also appears to use this combinatorial set of rules for assembly, again unlike any previously known virus.
