Title: Crumbling Walls: A Class of Practical and Efficient Quorum Systems Extended Abstract  
Author: David Peleg Avishai Wool 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general class of quorum systems called Crumbling Walls and study its properties. The elements (processors) of a wall are logically arranged in rows of varying widths. A quorum in a wall is the union of one full row and a representative from every row below the full row. This class considerably generalizes a number of known quorum system constructions. The best crumbling wall is the CWlog quorum system. It has small quorums, of size O(lg n), and structural simplicity. The CWlog has optimal availability and optimal load among systems with such small quorum size. It manifests its high quality for all universe sizes, so it is a good choice not only for systems with thousands or millions of processors but also for systems with as few as 3 or 5 processors. Moreover, our analysis shows that the availability will increase and the load will decrease at the optimal rates as the system increases in size.

Reference-contexts: Thus PickBalanced is appropriate in systems with broadcast communication capabilities in which the current configuration is available to the processors (e.g., the Transis system <ref> [ADKM92] </ref>), or in point-to-point systems in which probability p. the configuration changes are infrequent, where we can assume that the configuration is known for long periods of time.

Reference-contexts: In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced. Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries are proved. Alternative protocols based on quorum systems (rather than on voting) appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), <ref> [AE91] </ref> (the Tree system), [CAA90, KRS93] (using a grid), [Kum91, KC91, RT91, RST92] (hierarchical systems). The triangular system is due to [Lov73, EL75]. A generalization of the triangular system appears in [Nei92] under the name Lovasz coteries. The Wheel system appears in [MP92a]. <p> The constructions of [NW94] have both optimal load and high availability, however the availability becomes high only for large values of n. Additionally, all the existing constructions have quorum sizes larger than p n (except for the Tree construction of <ref> [AE91] </ref>). 1.3 New Results This paper introduces a new class of quorum system constructions, which we call Crumbling Walls (or simply walls). <p> The Lovasz coteries of [Nei92] are a generalization of the Triang, in which the first row contains a single element, and all the other rows contain at least 2 element each. A quorum in the system is defined as in the Triang. In the Tree system <ref> [AE91] </ref> the elements are organized in a complete rooted binary tree. A quorum in the system is defined recursively to be either (i) the union of the root and a quorum in one of the two subtrees, or (ii) the union of two quorums, one in each subtree. <p> This means that CWlog is asymptotically superior to the FPP [Mae85] and the Grid [CAA90], both of which have failure probabilities tending to 1 (see [KC91, RST92]). The CWlog has asymptotic availability similar to that of the Tree system of <ref> [AE91] </ref> (as analyzed in [PW93]). The CWlog has worse asymptotic availability than the constructions of [Kum91, KC91, NW94] and than the Maj system [Tho79], which has the optimal availability [BG87].

Reference-contexts: The simple majority system is the most obvious voting system. The availability of voting systems is studied in [BG87]. It is shown that in terms of availability, the majority is the best quorum system when p &lt; 1 2 . In <ref> [PW93, DKK + 94] </ref> the failure probability function F p is characterized, and among other things it is shown that the singleton has the best availability when p &gt; 1 2 . <p> The singleton system, denoted by Sngl, is the set system Sngl = ffugg. The majority system [Tho79], denoted by Maj, is the collection of all sets of n+1 2 elements over a universe U , when n = jU j is odd. The Wheel <ref> [MP92a, PW93] </ref> contains n 1 "spoke" quorums of the form f1; ig for i = 2; : : : ; n, and one "rim" quorum, f2; : : : ; ng. <p> Let fail (S) be the event that all the quorums S 2 S were hit, i.e., fail (S) = T S2S E S . Let the system failure probability be F p (S) = P (fail (S)).

Reference-contexts: Section 3 contains proofs of the basic properties of crumbling walls. In Section 4 we introduce the CWlog system and discuss its properties. In Section 5 we treat the asymptotic behavior of the failure probability of walls. A preliminary version of this paper can be found in <ref> [PW94] </ref>. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Definitions and Notation Let us first define the basic terminology used later on. Definition 2.1 A Set System S = fS 1 ; : : : ; S m g is a collection of subsets S i U of a finite universe U . <p> Our somewhat improved variant, in which representatives are required only below the full row, has smaller quorums and dominates the regular Grid. 3 The proofs are deferred to the full paper (see also <ref> [PW94] </ref>). where the summations are over all the values giving nonzero binomial coefficients. Using a combinatorial identity [Knu68, p. 84] we get #Walls = Fib (n 3). Remark: Proposition 3.4 counts non-isomorphic walls, in contrast to the counts of ND coteries and voting coteries cited above.

Reference-contexts: This situation leads to a quest for new quorum system constructions that combine small quorum sizes with high availability and low load, both asymptotically and for practical system sizes. 1.2 Related Work The first distributed control protocols using quorum systems <ref> [Tho79, Gif79] </ref> use voting to define the quorums.
