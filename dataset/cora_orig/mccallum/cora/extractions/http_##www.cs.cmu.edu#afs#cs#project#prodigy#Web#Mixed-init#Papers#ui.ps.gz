Title: Supporting Combined Human and Machine Planning: An Interface for Planning by Analogical Reasoning

Abstract: Realistic and complex planning situations require a mixed-initiative planning framework in which human and automated planners interact to mutually construct a desired plan. Ideally, this joint cooperation has the potential of achieving better plans than either the human or the machine can create alone. Human planners often take a case-based approach to planning, relying on their past experience and planning by retrieving and adapting past planning cases. Planning by analogical reasoning in which generative and case-based planning are combined, as in Prodigy/Analogy, provides a suitable framework to study this mixed-initiative integration. However, having a human user engaged in this planning loop creates a variety of new research questions. The challenges we found creating a mixed-initiative planning system fall into three categories: planning paradigms differ in human and machine planning; visualization of the plan and planning process is a complex, but necessary task; and human users range across a spectrum of experience, both with respect to the planning domain and the underlying planning technology. This paper presents our approach to these three problems when designing an interface to incorporate a human into the process of planning by analogical reasoning with Prodigy/Analogy. The interface allows the user to follow both generative and case-based planning, it supports visualization of both plan and the planning rationale, and it addresses the variance in the experience of the user by allowing the user to control the presentation of information.

Reference-contexts: Prodigy/Analogy includes several strategies to merge the guidance from the set of similar cases [13]. 3 Visualization of the Plan and the Planning Process One of the main goals underlying the design of the graphical user interface for PRODIGY is to provide a clear animation of the planning algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. Given the planning algorithm outlined in the previous section, we discuss several features in the user interface that enable the visualization of the running of algorithm.

The user interface runs in a separate process from the planner, and the two communicate through Tcl/Tks IPC mechanism. <p> Also, although not shown here (see <ref> [2] </ref> instead), the user can easily preempt automated planning decisions, making them manually instead. Finally, the system supports a concrete experiential basis for planning (i.e., planning is by cases, rather than strictly by first principles).

Reference-contexts: Within a mixed-initiative framework, however, a black-box philosophy that shields some of the technological and implementational details from the user (especially the nave user) can be appropriate as well <ref> [4] </ref>. A major goal of the interface reported here is to develop a selective-control mechanism to support the range of expertise from novice to expert in both dimensions.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, updating the state through this possible commitment allows Prodigy4.0 to use its state to more informed and efficient future decisions. Hence, the planning algorithm is a combination of state-space search corresponding to a simulation of plan execution of the plan (the head plan; <ref> [6] </ref>) and backward-chaining responsible for goal-directed reasoning (the tail plan). The reasons that these choices are made by the automated planner (or, if under user control, the user) are preserved in a plan derivation trace to improve planning efficiency in the future.

Reference-contexts: The system uses a similarity metric that weighs goal-relevant features <ref> [14] </ref>. Essentially, it selects a set of past cases that solved subsets of the new goal statement. The initial state is partially matched in the features that were relevant to solving these goals in the past.

Reference-contexts: From the beginning, the PRODIGY philosophy has been one of a glass-box approach, allowing the user to exert control over all aspects of decision making in the planner <ref> [15] </ref>. Within a mixed-initiative framework, however, a black-box philosophy that shields some of the technological and implementational details from the user (especially the nave user) can be appropriate as well [4]. <p> When under case-based planning mode (Prodigy/ Analogy), it retrieves from a case library past plans that are most similar to a given new problem. These plans are reused (replayed) to create a solution for the current goals. 2.1 The Generative Planning Algorithm The Prodigy4.0 system <ref> [15] </ref> employs a state-space nonlinear planner and follows a means-ends analysis backward-chaining search procedure that reasons about both multiple goals and multiple alternative operators from its domain theory appropriate for achieving such goals.

Reference-contexts: To further support the planner who is both a novice in the planning domain and knows little about planning formalisms, we have integrated Prodigy/Analogy with the ForMAT military-force deployment planner (see <ref> [16] </ref>). Using stored cases that match current planning problems, Prodigy/Analogy provides adaptation advice to the ForMAT user when modifying old deployment plans. In this mode, the user is remote across the internet and knows nothing about the manner in which Prodigy/Analogy works.
