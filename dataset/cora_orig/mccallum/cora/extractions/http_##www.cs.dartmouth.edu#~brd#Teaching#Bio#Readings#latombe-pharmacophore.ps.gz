Abstract: This paper describes a randomized approach for finding invariants in a set of flexible ligands (drug molecules) that underlies an integrated software system called RAPID currently under development. An invariant is a collection of features embedded in &lt; 3 which is present in one or more of the possible low-energy conformations of each ligand. Such invariants of chemically distinct molecules are useful for computational chemists since they may represent candidate pharmacophores. A pharmacophore contains the parts of the ligand that are primarily responsible for its interaction and binding with a specific receptor. It is regarded as an inverse image of a receptor and is used as a template for building more effective pharmaceutical drugs. The identification of pharmacophores is crucial in drug design since the structure of the targeted receptor is frequently unknown, but a number of molecules that interact with the receptor have been discovered by experiments. It is expected that our techniques and the results produced by our system will prove useful in other applications such as molecular database screening and comparative molecular field analysis.

Of course the problem is polynomially solvable when m = 2 [3] but that is not good enough for our purposes.

In the sequel, we consider the following version of LCP, called LCP-ff: determine a point set S of size jSj ffn congruent to some subset of each P i ; 1 i s.

This yields a bound of ~ O (n 2:8 =ff 3 ) on the running time for BASIC-SAMPLE. Run-time profiling revealed that BASIC-SAMPLE examines many spurious triples (i.e., those that do not yield a large invariant).

Our approach is fairly different and involves heavy use of randomized search techniques [39]. 4 Conformational Search The goal of conformational search as defined in Problem 1 (Section 2) is to produce a number of distinct low-energy conformations of a given ligand. We proceed as follows.

Reference-contexts: This assumption is supported by a number of experimental results showing molecules with geometric and chemical complementarity in their active, or binding, conformations [11]. When the three-dimensional structure of the receptor is known, docking methods <ref> [10] </ref> exploit both the geometric and the chemical information available. However, the geometric structures of relatively few molecules have been obtained via X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. As a result, computational chemists often try to develop pharmaceutical drugs for receptors whose structure is unknown [9, 37]. <p> Each of these contributes to a combinatorial explosion in the search process for the invariants. 3 Related Work As far as conformational search is concerned, both systematic and randomized techniques are being investigated <ref> [10, 32, 33] </ref>. Systematic search methods sample each torsional degree of freedom of the ligand at regularly spaced intervals and minimize all conformations produced [34]. These techniques can be prohibitively expensive [32] and several heuristics are employed to quickly prune away conformations that are close to previously generated conformations [43].

Reference-contexts: This distribution is frequently the uniform distribution. However, if some a priori information is available about the preferred values of a particular degree of freedom [31], then the corresponding values are selected according to a distribution that reflects the a priori information (i.e. a Gaussian distribution). An efficient minimizer <ref> [12, 40] </ref> is then used to obtain conformations at local energy minima. Minimization is the most time-consuming step during conformational search, so we have carefully optimized this procedure.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computational chemists working in the area of structure-based drug design consider both chemical and geometric properties of the interacting molecules when developing new pharmaceutical drugs <ref> [8, 28, 33] </ref>. The underlying assumption is that drug activity, or pharmacophoric activity, is obtained through the molecular recognition and binding of one molecule (ligand) to a pocket of another, usually larger, molecule (receptor). <p> Geometric invariants can also suggest alignments of molecules for input to CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) and other 3D QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) methods <ref> [9, 28] </ref>. These are methods that predict the activity of hypothetical compounds based on the assayed activity of previously synthesized ones. This paper describes our efforts to prototype an integrated software system, called RAPID (RAndomized Pharmacophore Identification for Drug design), for addressing the pharma-cophore identification problem.

Determining the congruence of two point-sets in &lt; 3 is tractable [1, 3] in the absence of complications such as noise. However, invariant identification is more closely related to the problem of identifying the largest common point set (LCP). <p> Unfortunately, the LCP problem turns out to exceedingly difficult; in fact, even for m collections of n points on the real line, the LCP cannot be approximated to within an n factor unless P = N P , and only weak positive results are known <ref> [2, 30] </ref>. Of course the problem is polynomially solvable when m = 2 [3] but that is not good enough for our purposes. Also, there are constraints in the molecular structures, but there are also various complications as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computational chemists working in the area of structure-based drug design consider both chemical and geometric properties of the interacting molecules when developing new pharmaceutical drugs <ref> [8, 28, 33] </ref>. The underlying assumption is that drug activity, or pharmacophoric activity, is obtained through the molecular recognition and binding of one molecule (ligand) to a pocket of another, usually larger, molecule (receptor). <p> Each of these contributes to a combinatorial explosion in the search process for the invariants. 3 Related Work As far as conformational search is concerned, both systematic and randomized techniques are being investigated <ref> [10, 32, 33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recent articles, which attempt to compare different methods, emphasize the superior quality of the results obtained with randomized methods [22]. Other considered methods produce low-energy conformations, which obey distance constraints, using inverse kinematics <ref> [36] </ref>, algebraic methods [24], or distance geometry techniques [17]. Note that the protein-folding problem is also a conformational search problem but its large size prohibits the use of the above techniques (see [18]).

Reference-contexts: However, the geometric structures of relatively few molecules have been obtained via X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. As a result, computational chemists often try to develop pharmaceutical drugs for receptors whose structure is unknown <ref> [9, 37] </ref>. The starting point in this case is a collection of ligands that have been experimentally discovered to interact with the considered receptor. <p> Figure 1 (c) shows the conformation of 1TMN of Figure 1 (a) as a set of points in &lt; 3 These points may represent atom centers or groups of atoms aggregated to one point endowed with a feature common to all these atoms (e.g., a rigid benzene ring) <ref> [37] </ref>. We assume that once a conformation is given, one can automatically transform it to a unique collection of points. For the purposes of this paper, a conformation C may represent a valid geometric embedding of a molecule where bonds are retained, or a set of points without bond information. <p> Also, there are constraints in the molecular structures, but there are also various complications as discussed earlier. In the computational chemistry literature, the most popular algorithms for invariant detection are based on clique-detection. For instance, DISCO <ref> [37] </ref> initially considers a pair of conformations c 1 and c 2 belonging to different molecules and constructs a correspondence graph G. The nodes of G are all node pairs, and an edge is created if the pairs in each of the connected nodes can be matched simultaneously. <p> A clique detection algorithm [13] is then used to find cliques in G. These correspond to invariants in c 1 and c 2 , and thus to candidate pharmacophores. Maximum clique detection is NP-hard [21], but this algorithm seems to work well in practice <ref> [37, 44] </ref>. The approach has been generalized to n conformations by choosing a reference conformation and comparing it with the other n 1 conformations.

Reference-contexts: Given this situation, several new approaches are under development. For instance, one idea is to start with small invariants (2-3 features) and gradually expand them [9]. Our approach is fairly different and involves heavy use of randomized search techniques <ref> [39] </ref>. 4 Conformational Search The goal of conformational search as defined in Problem 1 (Section 2) is to produce a number of distinct low-energy conformations of a given ligand. We proceed as follows. Initially a large number of conformations are generated at random. <p> The proof of this theorem is straightforward. Observe that the probability of picking three points that belong to the common substructure is at least ff 3 . Applying a Chernoff bound <ref> [39] </ref> yields the desired probability. Theorem 3 BASIC-SAMPLE runs in time ~ O (n 2:8 3 ) using space O (n 2 ). 4 The running time can be written as T = n P 1=ff 3 where i is the number of candidate transformations generated during iteration i.

Reference-contexts: Besides providing starting points for designing effective pharmaceutical drugs, there are several important applications where geometric invariant identification is useful. For example, the geometric invariants identified by our system can help in the formulation of database queries that may retrieve functionally equivalent, but structurally novel, molecules from molecular databases <ref> [44] </ref>. Geometric invariants can also suggest alignments of molecules for input to CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) and other 3D QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) methods [9, 28]. These are methods that predict the activity of hypothetical compounds based on the assayed activity of previously synthesized ones. <p> A clique detection algorithm [13] is then used to find cliques in G. These correspond to invariants in c 1 and c 2 , and thus to candidate pharmacophores. Maximum clique detection is NP-hard [21], but this algorithm seems to work well in practice <ref> [37, 44] </ref>.
