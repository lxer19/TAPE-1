Abstract: In this paper, we report on a first estimate of the contribution of galaxies to the diffuse extragalactic background from the far-UV to the submm, based on semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution. We conclude that the global multi-wavelength picture seems to be consistent provided a quite important fraction of star-formation be hidden in dust-enshrouded systems at intermediate and high-redshift. We show that, according to such models, galaxies cannot stand as important contributors to the background hydrogen-ionizing flux at high-redshift unless neutral hydrogen absorption sites are clumpy and uncorrelated with star forming regions. We briefly discuss the robustness of such a result.

Then, one is naturally able to derive the time evolution of the Lyman-limit background from star-forming galaxies. This is what is shown in Fig. 2. Two conclusions can be drawn from this figure. First, galaxies produce the required amount of luminosity to explain the observations. <p> Hence we believe that the limits we derived for the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the Lyman-limit background flux are fairly robust. A more detailed discussion may be looked up in <ref> [2] </ref>. We conclude that in many respects, the picture that emerges in different windows from the UV to the submm does not seem to be inconsistent.

Reference-contexts: This is due to the fact contribution from the semi-analytic models with a "burst-like" star formation rate at intermediate and high-redshift. The dashed line is the background flux predicted by the same models with a "quiescent" star formation rate (see text). For details see <ref> [3] </ref>, [5]. that this UV to submm background gives a fair estimate of the amount of energy released by cosmic star formation at all epochs in the universe.

Recent observations (see <ref> [4] </ref>) have enabled a detection of this background in the IR/submm and the lower limits given by faint counts in the optical and near IR both from the ground and from space with HST are very close to a detection of the optical background (see [9]).

Reference-contexts: These stars interact with the medium in which they formed, enriching it with metals and dust or blowing it away. Giving reasonable prescriptions to describe these mechanisms enables one to compute statistical properties of galaxies, say, their luminosity function (L). As demonstrated for instance by <ref> [6] </ref>, such semi-analytic models can match the optical data quite well. We have extended such models to the IR window, in order to be able to handle the energy budget of galaxies correctly. In the following, we discuss results we obtained thanks to this extension.

Reference-contexts: These results are mainly based on the assumption that the UV flux seen by Madau and co-workers (see <ref> [8] </ref>) in the Hubble Deep Field has been correctly estimated. However, one would have to increase this flux by more than an order of magnitude and invoke a very clumpy distribution of HI in the ISM, to turn galaxies into important contributors to the Lyman-limit flux.

As shown in Fig. 1, models with "quiescent" star formation rates (meaning a star formation history which varies slowly as in our own Milky Way) do not reproduce the detected IR/submm extragalactic background flux.
