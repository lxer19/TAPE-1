Title: PROJECT FOR CSC 2108 AUTOMATED VERIFICATION Prof. Marsha Checkic Studying the behaviour of Place/Transition and
Author: Cathy Jansen, Alberto Paccanaro 
Abstract: Some elementary concepts on Equational Theories and Term Rewriting Systems are introduced, followed by a brief review of the main ideas of the Knuth-Bendix Completion procedure. Then a formalization of Place/Transition and Coloured Petri Nets as Term Rewriting Systems is proposed, which allows the use of Rewriting Techniques for studying the behaviour of such nets. We verify the relationships existing between Completion, Theorem Proving and Term Simplification and some properties of Petri Nets, and show how such operations can be used to prove facts about the nets. Particularly , the formalization proposed in this paper leads to an efficient method for determining the movements of the tokens in the net, and it allows a natural way of simplifying nets in order to express more efficiently the movements of tokens when transitions are fired. The theory has been implemented using LP, the Larch Prover which has been used to derive the results of the examples presented in this paper.

Now we need to prove that there always exists a weight assignment to the unary function symbols such that the order of the rewrite rules is preserved.
