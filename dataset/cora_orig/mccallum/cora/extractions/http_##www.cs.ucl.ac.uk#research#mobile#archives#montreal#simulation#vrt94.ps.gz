Abstract: We give an overview of the main techniques for improving the statistical efficiency of simulation estimators. Efficiency improvement is typically (but not always) achieved through variance reduction. We discuss methods such as common random numbers, antithetic variates, control variates, importance sampling, conditional Monte Carlo, stratified sampling, and some others, as well as the combination of certain of those methods. We also survey the recent literature on this topic.

Reference-contexts: Special cases of that correlation-induction frame-work include AV and the latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method <ref> (Avramidis and Wilson 1994) </ref>, which we now describe. Select a finite subset as above and for each k 2 , generate a random permutation of the integers f1; : : :; ng (independently for the different indices k), and let i;k denote the ith element of that permutation.

Reference-contexts: Roughly, if Z contains much less information than X, then the CMC estimator X cm = E [X j Z] should have much less variability than X. More specifically, one has <ref> (Bratley, Fox, and Schrage 1987) </ref> E [X cm ] = E [X] and Var [X cm ] = Var [X] E [Var [X j Z]], so the variance can only decrease.
