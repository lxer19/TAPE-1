Title: A FAMILY OF OVERLAPPING SCHWARZ ALGORITHMS FOR NONSYMMETRIC AND INDEFINITE ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS  
Author: XIAO-CHUAN CAI 
Abstract: The classical Schwarz alternating method has recently been generalized in several directions. This effort has resulted in a number of new powerful domain decomposition methods for solving general elliptic problems, including the nonsymmetric and indefinite cases. In this paper, we present several overlapping Schwarz preconditioned Krylov space iterative methods for solving elliptic boundary value problems with operators that are dominated by the self-adjoint, second-order terms, but need not be either self-adjoint or definite. All algorithms discussed in this paper involve two levels of preconditioning, and one of the critical components is a global coarse grid problem. We show that, under certain assumptions, the algorithms are optimal in the sense that the convergence rates of the preconditioned Krylov iterative methods are independent of the number of unknowns of the linear system and also the number of subdomains. The optimal convergence theory holds for problems in both two- and three-dimensional spaces, and for both structured and unstructured grids. Some numerical results are presented also. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we present a family of overlapping domain decomposition methods for the solution of large, sparse, nonsymmetric and/or indefinite linear systems of equations obtained by discretizing elliptic partial differential

Reference-contexts: We denote the energy norm associated with the matrix A as k k A = (A; ) 1=2 : In practice, there are many discretization schemes can be used to obtain the linear system (3), such as the artificial diffusion and streamline diffusion methods [23] and the methods in <ref> [1] </ref>. Multiple discretizations can also be combined in the same iterative process; see, e.g., [24]. The preconditioning techniques to be discussed in the next few sections can easily be used together with these discretization schemes. 3 2.

For a comparison of some of the overlapping and nonoverlapping algorithms, we refer to the paper <ref> [8] </ref>. Overlapping methods generally permit simple (Dirichlet) updating of the boundary data of the subregions at the expense of having to solve some larger linear systems, defined on subregions, per iteration from the redundantly degrees of freedom. <p> An advantage of the overlapping methods, over non-overlapping substructuring type methods, is that the solution of the so-called interface problems (see <ref> [8, 13] </ref>) can always be avoided. We remark here that a general purpose, robust interface solver that guarantees the optimal convergence for the class of general variable coefficients, nonsymmetric and indefinite elliptic problems is yet to be introduced. <p> For comparison, We also include some results obtained by using ILU (k) as preconditioners. Two test problems will be considered. A more complete comparison of overlapping Schwarz algorithms with other domain decomposition algorithms can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Some three dimensional experiences with overlapping Schwarz algorithms can be found in [22]. Example 1. Lu = 4 u + ffiu x + ffiu y : Example 2.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, a global grid is assumed to have been introduced before the domain, or mesh, is partitioned into subdomains. We shall consider only the second approach. Some of the material presented in this paper can also be found the references <ref> [8, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. This family of overlapping Schwarz algorithms has been shown to be efficient and robust for solving differential equations of many different types under a wide range of circumstances. <p> These subdomains can be of any shapes. In the case of unstructured meshes, this partitioning is often achieved by using certain graph partitioning techniques; namely, we first define an adjacency graph for the finite element mesh, then partition the graph into a number of disjoint subgraphs. We refer to <ref> [10, 21, 26, 33] </ref> for issues of graph partitioning. We assume that the vertices of any i , not on @, coincide with the h-level nodes. <p> Color "0" is for the global coarse grid. The extended subregions of the other colors are indicated by the dotted boundaries. same color. Obviously, colorings are not unique. Simple greedy heuristic subgraph coloring algorithms have been discussed in the literature; see for examples, <ref> [10] </ref>. Numerical experiments support the expectation that minimizing the number of colors enhances convergence. An optimal five-color strategy (J = 4) is shown for the decomposition in Figure 1, in which the total number of subregions (including the coarse grid on the global region) is N + 1 = 17. <p> In fact, both additive and multiplicative Schwarz algorithms are special cases of this family of polynomial Schwarz algorithms. Finally, in the last subsection, we briefly discuss an algebraic extension of the overlapping Schwarz algorithms, introduced recently in <ref> [10] </ref>, for solving general sparse linear systems. 3.1. Multiplicative Schwarz method (MSM). Unlike other preconditioners, such as the additive Schwarz, MSM algorithm can be employed either as an iterative algorithm by itself or used as a preconditioner. <p> For examples, the above linear system can be "solved", by (1) a few multigrid cycles [29]; or (2) a few Gauss-Seidel (SOR, SSOR, Jacobi) iterations; or (3) replacing B k with its ILU [30] or ILUT factorization [34], etc. 9 3.5. Algebraic Schwarz algorithms. According to <ref> [10] </ref>, the previously studied Schwarz framework can also be extended for solving general sparse linear systems. The fundamental principle underlying this extension is to replace the domain of definition of the problem by the adjacency graph of the sparse matrix, i.e., the graph that represents its non-zero pattern. <p> We note that by switching from a domain to a graph the concept of Euclidean distance, which plays an important role in the optimality analysis of these domain decomposition methods, is lost. It was shown in <ref> [10] </ref> that, mostly by means of numerical experiments, that the efficiency of the overlapping methods can be preserved to some extent with certain well-balanced overlapping graph decomposition. Suppose B = fb ij g is an n fi n sparse matrix. <p> The only missing piece is the coarse preconditioner. As indicated in <ref> [10] </ref>, without further geometric information of the problem, to define a coarse preconditioner is generally very difficult. 4. Convergence theory. We now discuss very briefly a theory that can provide with us some understanding of these Schwarz preconditioners.

This family of overlapping Schwarz algorithms has been shown to be efficient and robust for solving differential equations of many different types under a wide range of circumstances. <p> A coarse space, which is used in all the algorithms, plays an extremely important role in obtaining the optimality. It essentially reduces the original nonsymmetric and/or indefinite elliptic problem to a positive definite problem <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, which may not be symmetric. Most of the theory concerning the convergence rate of domain decomposition methods is in the framework of the Galerkin finite element method. <p> We begin with the overlapping partitioning of the mesh.

Reference-contexts: An obvious symmetrization exists, upon which a conjugate gradient method can be used as the acceleration method; however, we shall not emphasize the case of a symmetric B in this paper. 3.2. Additive Schwarz algorithm (ASM). An additive variant of the Schwarz alternating method was originally proposed in <ref> [15, 17, 31] </ref> for selfadjoint elliptic problems and extended to nonselfadjoint elliptic cases in [5, 11]. The idea is simply to give up the data dependency between the subproblems defined on subregions with different colors, as in going from Gauss-Seidel to Jacobi.

Reference-contexts: We remark that algorithms based on preconditioned iterative solution of the normal equations can also be used to solve nonsymmetric and/or indefinite linear systems, but are beyond the scope of this paper. Interested readers should consult, for exam 2 ples, <ref> [3, 28, 32] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. In the rest of this section, we shall define our model elliptic problem and its discretization. Section 2 is devoted to the description of an overlapping partitioning of the mesh, as well as algorithms for subdomain coloring.

Reference-contexts: These subdomains can be of any shapes. In the case of unstructured meshes, this partitioning is often achieved by using certain graph partitioning techniques; namely, we first define an adjacency graph for the finite element mesh, then partition the graph into a number of disjoint subgraphs. We refer to <ref> [10, 21, 26, 33] </ref> for issues of graph partitioning. We assume that the vertices of any i , not on @, coincide with the h-level nodes.

Reference-contexts: the lack of a generally applicable discretization technique for the general nonsymmetric elliptic operator, the lack of "good" algebraic iterative methods (such as CG for symmetric, positive definite problems), and the incompleteness of the mathematical theory for the performance of the algebraic iterative methods that do exist, such as GMRES <ref> [35, 36] </ref>. By a "good" method, we mean a method that is provably convergent within memory requirements proportional to a small multiple of the number of degrees of freedom in the system, independent of the operator. <p> We remark that the bounds (10), (11), (12) and (13) can be used to estimate, theoretically, the number of iterations for some of the Krylov space iteration methods, such as GMRES. As is well-known, the GMRES method, introduced in <ref> [35] </ref>, is mathematically equivalent to the generalized conjugate residual (GCR) method [20] and can be used to solve the linear system of algebraic equations: P x = b;(14) where P is a nonsingular matrix, which may be nonsymmetric or indefinite, and b is a given vector in R n . <p> The algorithm is parameter-free and quite robust. Its main disadvantage is its linear-in-m memory requirement. To fit the available memory, one is sometimes forced to use the k-step restarted GMRES method <ref> [35] </ref>. 5. Numerical experiments. We present a few numerical experiments in this section to illustrate the convergence behavior of some of the Schwarz algorithms. For comparison, We also include some results obtained by using ILU (k) as preconditioners. Two test problems will be considered.

Reference-contexts: This family of methods originates from the classical Schwarz alternating algorithm, introduced in 1870 by H. A. Schwarz <ref> [37] </ref> in an existence proof for elliptic boundary value problems defined in certain irregular regions. This method has attracted much attention as a convenient computational method for the solution of a large class of elliptic or parabolic equations, see e.g., [14, 38], especially on parallel machines, [22].

Reference-contexts: A. Schwarz [37] in an existence proof for elliptic boundary value problems defined in certain irregular regions. This method has attracted much attention as a convenient computational method for the solution of a large class of elliptic or parabolic equations, see e.g., <ref> [14, 38] </ref>, especially on parallel machines, [22]. There are essentially two ways to use the algorithm as a computational tool. The first approach is to use it directly on the continuous partial differential equation defined on a physical domain.
