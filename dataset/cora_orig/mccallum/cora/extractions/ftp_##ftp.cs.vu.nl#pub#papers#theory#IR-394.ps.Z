Title: Alexandroff and Scott Topologies for Generalized Ultrametric Spaces  
Author: M.M. Bonsangue, F. van Breugel, and J.J.M.M. Rutten 
Abstract: Both preorders and ordinary ultrametric spaces are instances of generalized ul-trametric spaces. Every generalized ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded in a (complete) function space by means of an ultrametric version of the categorical Yoneda Lemma. This simple fact gives naturally rise to: 1. a topology for generalized ultrametric spaces which for arbitrary preorders corresponds to the Alexandroff topology and for ordinary ultrametric spaces reduces to the *-ball topology; 2. a topology for algebraic complete generalized ultrametric spaces generalizing both the Scott topology for arbitrary algebraic complete partial orders and the *-ball topology for complete ultrametric spaces.

We propose two topologies on generalized ultrametric spaces. <p> This category is also monoidal closed. Many properties of gum's derive from this categorical structure on [0; 1] (cf. <ref> [Law73, Rut95, BBR95] </ref>). A gum generally does not satisfy 3. if X (x; y) = 0 and X (y; x) = 0 then x = y, 4. X (x; y) = X (y; x), which are the additional conditions that hold for an ordinary ultrametric space. <p> Therefore by using the Yoneda embedding of Corollary 3.2, we have that every gum can be isometrically embedded in a complete gum. This fact is used in <ref> [BBR95] </ref> to define the completion of a gum X. A mapping f : X ! Y between gum's X and Y is continuous if it preserves limits: if x = lim x n in X then f (x) = lim f (x n ) in Y . <p> b m ) [y B is isometric (Corollary 3.2)] = lim lim X (a n ; b m ) [B X] n X (a n ; y) [a n is finite in X] = X (x; y) [definition of limit] 2 The converse of the above theorem holds as well <ref> [BBR95, Theorem 5.6] </ref>. For an algebraic complete gum X with basis B we can now consider the collection ^ B of fuzzy subsets of B rather than the collection ^ X as we have done in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: For both topologies the two alternative definitions are shown to coincide. Our definition of the generalized Alexandroff topology in terms of open sets is similar to the ones given by Smyth [Smy87, Smy91] and Flagg and Kopperman <ref> [FK95] </ref>. A definition of a generalized Scott topology in terms of open sets similar to ours is briefly mentioned by Smyth in [Smy87]. The definitions of the topologies in terms of closure operators are new. <p> For instance, for every x in X, the *-ball B * (x) is a gA-open set. The pair hX; O gA (X)i can be shown to be a topological space with fB * (x) j * &gt; 0 and x 2 Xg as basis (cf. <ref> [FK95] </ref>). Every topology O (X) on a set X induces a preorder on X called the specialization preorder: for any x and y in X, x O y if and only if 8V 2 O (X); x 2 V ) y 2 V . <p> Recently, we have been influenced also by the work of Flagg and Kopperman <ref> [FK95] </ref> and Wagner [Wag94]. Generalized ultrametric spaces are a special instance of Lawvere's V-categories. The nonsymmetric ultrametric for [0; 1] is also described and studied in his paper. The notion of forward Cauchy for a non-symmetric metric space is from [Smy87] as well as the notion of limit.

Reference-contexts: According the terminology of the latter paper, our generalized Scott topology is the finest strongly appropriate topology for an algebraic complete quasi ultrametric space X whenever X is taken together with the standard quasi-uniformity. Recently, Flagg and Sunderhauf <ref> [FS95] </ref> have proved a quasi metric version of Hofmann's Theorem on the soberification of the generalized Alexandroff topology. It has as a corollary the fact that the generalized Scott topology on an algebraic complete quasi ultrametric space is sober. A generalized Scott topology is given also in [Wag95].

Also for gum's, a suitable refinement of the generalized Alexandroff topology exists. A key step towards its definition is the following restriction of the Yoneda embedding to a continuous and isometric function. Theorem 5.1 Let X be a complete gum.

Reference-contexts: The present work is inspired by Lawvere's enriched-categorical view of generalized metric spaces [Law73] as well as the more topological view of Smyth on quasi metric spaces [Smy87, Smy91]. It is based on the work <ref> [Rut95] </ref>, in which some of the basic theory of generalized ultrametric spaces has fl Department of Computer Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081a, 1081 HV Ams-terdam, The Netherlands, email: marcello@cs.vu.nl. y School of Computer Science, McGill University, 3480 University Street, Montreal H3A 2A7, Canada, email: franck@cs.mcgill.ca. <p> We considered generalized ultrametric space because the distance induced by a preorder is indeed a generalized ultrametric. Moreover, because of the strong triangle inequality, ultrametric space are|from a computational point of view|better behaved than metric spaces and seem to arise naturally in the semantics of programming languages (cf. <ref> [Rut95] </ref>). The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 4 give the basic definitions and facts on generalized ultrametric spaces. The Yoneda Lemma and the generalized Alexandroff topology are discussed in Section 3, while the generalized Scott topology is presented in Section 5. Finally Section 6 discusses related work. <p> This category is also monoidal closed. Many properties of gum's derive from this categorical structure on [0; 1] (cf. <ref> [Law73, Rut95, BBR95] </ref>). A gum generally does not satisfy 3. if X (x; y) = 0 and X (y; x) = 0 then x = y, 4. X (x; y) = X (y; x), which are the additional conditions that hold for an ordinary ultrametric space. <p> It follows that a preorder is complete if and only if all its !-chains have a least upper-bound. Complete partial orders are called cpo. For ordinary ultrametric spaces this definition of completeness is the usual one. There is the following fact (cf. Theorem 6.5 of <ref> [Rut95] </ref>). Proposition 4.2 Let X and Y be gum's. If Y is complete then Y X is complete. Moreover, limits are pointwise: let (f n ) n be a Cauchy sequence in Y X and f an element in Y X . <p> A purely enriched-categorical definition of forward Cauchy sequences and of limits can be found in Wagner's [Wag94, Wag95]. The notion of finiteness and algebraicity for a generalized ultrametric spaces are from <ref> [Rut95] </ref>.

Other papers on reconciling complete partial orders with metric spaces are <ref> [WS81, CD85, Doi88, Mat94] </ref>. Different definitions of Cauchy sequence for non-symmetric metric spaces can be found in [RSV82]. 18

Reference-contexts: This observation corresponds to a generalized ultrametric version of the categorical Yoneda Lemma <ref> [Yon54] </ref>. The corresponding Yoneda embedding isometrically embeds a generalized ultrametric space X into the generalized ultrametric space of fuzzy predicates on X. By comparing the fuzzy predicates on X with the subsets of X we obtain the closure operator defining the generalized Alexandroff topology.
