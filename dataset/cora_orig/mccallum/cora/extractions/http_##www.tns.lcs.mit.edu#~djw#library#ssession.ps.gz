Abstract: Multi-party applications are of great importance, and perhaps the greatest challenge is achieving both a) robustness in terms of adaptation to dynamic topology and group membership, and b) scalability in terms of bandwidth, state, and processing, as the size of a group grows. Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) [1] is a rich example of a robust design intended to work across a wide range of group sizes and dynamic topologies. However, the adaptation mechanisms in SRM rely on shared group state achieved via exchange of session messages. Similar synchronization is likely to be of importance in other multiparty applications and services. Various mechanisms have been proposed to reduce the overhead of this loose group synchronization. This paper applies the concept of self-configuring hierarchy to SRM. Unlike previous proposals, our mechanism uses a stochastic algorithm for self-configuration based on randomized timers and local appropriateness measures. We present initial evaluations of the impact of this mechanism on SRM performance, and evaluate the hierarchical structure formed by the protocol participants. Many interesting questions remain to be investigate in future work such as self-evaluation of appropriateness, dynamics and stability of self-configuration process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Various multicast transport protocols <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref> have been proposed to provide reliability and other transport level functions on top of IP multicast [7]. One such protocol, Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) [1], is a reliable multicast framework for application level framing and light-weight sessions. <p> 1 Introduction Various multicast transport protocols [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have been proposed to provide reliability and other transport level functions on top of IP multicast [7]. One such protocol, Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [1] </ref>, is a reliable multicast framework for application level framing and light-weight sessions. <p> A similar algorithm is used for scheduling repairs when a request is received. Any member that has received data can participate in the repair process. Algorithms for adapting the various parameters for scheduling requests and repairs have also been proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.3 Scaling Issues The SRM session messages are sent to the whole group at regular intervals. If the session messages are sent at fixed intervals, the bandwidth consumed by global distribution of session messages is proportional to the square of the size of the group. <p> The values of the loss recovery parameters (C1; C2; D1; D2) was set to (2:0; 2:0; 1:0; 1:0) for the simulations presented here. We are conducting more performance comparisons using adaptive timer parameters as described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 7 shows the number of requests per loss for the two schemes. We observed that scalable session messages did not significantly increase the number of requests per-loss. <p> Loss Recovery Performance The underlying topology of the network affects the loss recovery performance of SRM. Floyd et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> suggest adjusting the timer parameters based on the past behavior of loss recovery process. In this paper, we have compared the loss recovery performance using fixed timer parameters. Future work will study scalable session messages' loss recovery performance with adaptive timer parameters.

Reference-contexts: The distance estimation is based on a simplified version of the NTP <ref> [8] </ref> algorithm. Figure 1 shows one round of session message exchange to estimate the distance between two members. Session message P 1 is sent by member A at time T 1. Member B records the time T 2 when P 1 arrives at B.

Reference-contexts: To counter this problem SRM rate limits the session messages to a small fraction (e.g. 5%) of the data bandwidth. SRM uses the same algorithm as RTP (Realtime Transport Protocol) <ref> [9] </ref> for adapting the session message frequency to the size of the group. As the size of the group grows, each member reduces the frequency of session message transmission. While this keeps the session message overhead low it can lead to very poor response times. <p> The rate limiting mechanism has to be extended for hierarchical distribution of session messages. We need to design mechanisms for sharing the session message bandwidth among differently scoped session messages. Generalizing our Approach to other Protocols Global group synchronization is required by other multiparty end-to-end protocols such as RTP <ref> [9] </ref>. Such protocols that distribute information globally can also use the mechanisms suggested in this paper for improving the scaling behavior. Though we have described the scheme assuming two levels, it is can be extended to a multiple level hierarchy also.

Reference-contexts: While this keeps the session message overhead low it can lead to very poor response times. The interval between session messages grows linearly with the size of the group. Timely exchange of session messages is particularly important when network topology and session membership dynamics occur <ref> [10] </ref>. Low frequency session messages result in slow adaptation to the network conditions. As mentioned earlier, the requests and repairs are scheduled based on the distances to the other members. Thus each member must maintain a table of distances to every other member.

Reference-contexts: We briefly discuss some of the existing work addressing these scaling issues before presenting our approach. 2.4 Related Work The scaling problems described in the previous section have been observed for SRM and some other end-to-end multiparty protocols <ref> [11] </ref>. Some of the approaches that have been proposed are: 1. Delay Report and Echo : Montgomery [12] suggests a report-echo mechanism for computing the delays between the various members. The members send a delay-report (DR) requesting other members to echo back the information about the delay.

Reference-contexts: Each member has to store distance to every other member. Thus this scheme scales better than the original SRM scheme but not for very large groups. 2. Distance Vector Style Distribution : An approach similar to the distance vector routing information exchange has been proposed for SRM session messages <ref> [13] </ref>. The members only exchange session messages with their neighbors and aggregate group states received from their neighbors. Such message exchange requires an overlapped chain of scopes as shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: We will build on this concept of scoped messages, however, using hierarchy to improve scaling. 4 3. Proxy Servers : Proxy servers have been used for web caching and other network optimizations. For example, the Session Advertisement Protocol (SAP) <ref> [14] </ref> proposes uses of proxy servers for advertising on behalf of local members. A similar approach, where the proxy servers distribute the session messages on behalf of members local to it, can be used in SRM.

Reference-contexts: Proxy servers limit the distribution of session messages to a local region. However, because it relies on static configuration this approach is not efficient for SRM like protocols that have dynamically changing membership and assume underlying topology dynamics <ref> [15] </ref>. Also it might require non-participating members to be involved in distribution of session messages.

Reference-contexts: To improve the scalability of session message distribution, we developed a self-configuration protocol to dynamically organize the participants in a hierarchy and distribute session messages with limited scope. Use of hierarchy reduces <ref> [16] </ref> the number of members at any level and hence improves the scaling properties of SRM. In particular, distribution of session messages with limited scope tackles the bandwidth usage problem because not all members send session messages with global scope.

Reference-contexts: The scope of a member's session messages is determined by its level in the hierarchy. This scoping of session messages is similar to the scoping of control messages used in Landmark Hierarchy routing protocol <ref> [17] </ref> and interdomain PIM [18]. In this study we assume a two level hierarchy for SRM session message dissemination, although we believe our approach is extensible to any number of levels in hierarchy, for this study we assume a two level hierarchy for session message dissemination.

Reference-contexts: We conducted simulations on a wide range of scenarios with different topologies, session sizes and member placement. In this paper we present the simulation results using the topology shown in the Figure 6. This topology is a 100 node transit-stub topology generated using Georgia Tech Internet Topology generator <ref> [24] </ref>. Transit-stub topologies are two level hierarchical graphs generated by interconnecting transit and stub domains. Several measurements were taken for various session sizes. Other topologies also showed similar results. <p> The total session message traffic is another potential metric for such comparisons. Some of the analyses performed on the hierarchies constructed using our self-configuration algorithm are presented here. Our simulations used transit-stub topologies generated by the Georgia Tech Internet Topology generator <ref> [24] </ref>. In this section we present some simulation results with a 440 node, 629 links, transit-stub topology with 2 transit domains. The session size was 90 and the members were chosen randomly from the stub domains. No member was placed in the transit domains.
