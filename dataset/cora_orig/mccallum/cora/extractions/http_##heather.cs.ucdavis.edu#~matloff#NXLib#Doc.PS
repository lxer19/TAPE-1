Reference-contexts: Especially the latter approach seems to be promising as distributed memory multiprocessors achieve good scalability. Recently, networks of workstations have also become popular to serve as a computational resource. Several message-passing libraries which support parallel applications on coupled workstations have become available [2] <ref> [1] </ref> [9] [3]. Most of these environments are also available for multicomputer systems, which allows for migrating applications from networks of workstations to multicomputer systems and vice versa. The disadvantage of the above approaches is, that on multicomputer systems these environments introduce additional software overhead.
