Reference-contexts: These functions provide a translation mechanism from one level of attributes to another. Hence they should be considered as an integral part of the design of multi-level simulations. The rules-of-thumb suggested in <ref> [Allen92] </ref> are useful guidelines in the design of and . 7.3 Load Considerations In a typical disaggregation approach, computing resources must be available to simulate the newly generated DEs when an AE is disaggregated.

Some of our definitions are based on those in <ref> [AMG95] </ref>. Object: A fundamental element of a conceptual representation that reects the real world at levels of abstraction and resolution appropriate for a planned simulation. Entity: A unit of organization at some level of abstraction, such as a tank, human, platoon, battalion, cloud or radar.

Reference-contexts: In the Local Virtual approach, the DE receives aggregate information from the AE. The DE then locally disaggregates the AE information in order to obtain the level of information it needs. This is also known as pseudo-disaggregation and is employed by the JPSD program <ref> [Calder95] </ref>. It solves the chain disaggregation problem, but exhibits other problems. Temporal inconsistency could occur if two DEs locally disaggregate the same AE using different algorithms. Furthermore, this solution is not scalable, because each DE may have to know how to disaggregate every AE in the simulation.

Reference-contexts: While reaggregating, for example, the actual positions of the DEs may be lost. If the aircraft returns within a short time after reaggregation, a disaggregation must be effected. On disaggregating again, a standard algorithm or doctrine [France93] <ref> [Clark94] </ref> would be applied to position the entities. This might cause unrealistic discontinuities or jumps in position. 5 Proposed Approach It is clear from the above discussions that temporal inconsistency must be solved in order to make multi-level simulations feasible.

Reference-contexts: These equations are easily computed in their simplest form, but in order to model the capabilities of the aggregated entities better, a number of factors are added to the equations, making them more time-consuming to compute <ref> [Karr83] </ref>. It is then possible to reach a state where entities have an inconsistent view of each other, as follows. In the airborne reconnaissance example, suppose battalion A 1 is engaged in a battle with another battalion A 2 . A 1 and A 2 interact at the battalion level.

Reference-contexts: of aggregation, and low-resolution means high level of aggregation. 4 Problems with Current Approaches A common approach for handling interactions between AEs and DEs in a multi-level simulation has been to designate some areas of the battlefield as virtual playboxes in which all interactions are performed at the DE level <ref> [Karr94] </ref>. When an AE enters the playbox, it undergoes a disaggregation process whereby the AE is separated into its constituent DEs. Upon leaving the playbox, these DEs may reaggregate.

Reference-contexts: Some solutions to chain disaggregation 5 4.4 Transition Latency We refer to the time taken to effect an aggregation or disaggregation as the transition period. Transition periods can be significantly long depending on the complexity of the protocol. For example, a proposal in <ref> [Robkin92] </ref> requires on the order of 10 seconds to complete the aggregation process. This is because each DE could request to be reaggregated, and each could also refuse to be reaggregated, thus stopping the entire process.

Reference-contexts: However, several options arise when AEs interact with DEs. A nave approach is to disaggregate an AE whenever it comes into sensor proximity of a DE. However, this could cause chain disaggregation, wherein many AEs are forced to disaggregate in a short period of time <ref> [Smith94] </ref>. Consider a simple case where four AEs are interacting in the following linear fashion (A B indicates that entities A and B interact with each other), i.e. AE 1 AE 2 AE 3 AE 4 . AE 1 comes into contact with a DE, causing AE 1 to disaggregate.
