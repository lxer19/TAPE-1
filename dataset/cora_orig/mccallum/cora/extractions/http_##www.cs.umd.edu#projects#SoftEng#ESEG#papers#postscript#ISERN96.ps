Abstract: The external validity of an empirical investigation can be incrementally strengthened by replications performed by independent researchers. External replications can be promoted by the availability of experimental kits which package the experience of the original researchers. We present the lab manual of a controlled experiment for evaluating the effectiveness of a software reading technique known as Perspective-Based Reading (PBR). The lab manual includes the experimental design, the instruments for its execution, and the procedures for statistical tests. We have made the lab manual available over the World Wide Web. We hope to use the experiences we have gained through this process to evolve a lab package that meets the needs of software engineering researchers, to develop a consistent method for packaging experiments, and to facilitate the replication of experiments.

Reference-contexts: In order to address these difficulties and encourage replication of a particular experiment we have developed a lab package. The package is designed to facilitate replication of an experiment for evaluating the effectiveness of Perspective-Based Reading (PBR) <ref> [BGLLSSZ96] </ref>. We refer to it throughout this paper as a concrete example to illustrate our discussion of essential elements of a useful lab package. The lab package has three major objectives: 1 . Description of the particular technique under study (PBR). 2 .
