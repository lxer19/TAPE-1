Abstract: A key issue in designing software multicast algorithms is to consider the trade-off between performance and portability. Portable software multicast algorithms which base on generic communication models cannot capture some architecture-specific features. Without considering the underlying network architecture, these multicast algorithms may not achieve the truly optimal performance when implemented in real networks. The objective of this research is to investigate architecture-dependent tuning on performance of multicast algorithms developed based on architecture-independent models. Specifically, we intend to optimize the mulitcast algorithm based on the parameterized communication model. We propose two multicast algorithms, OPT-mesh and OPT-min which are the optimized versions of the parameterized multicast algorithm for wormhole-switched mesh networks and BMIN networks, respectively. Using our flit-level simulator, the performance of both algorithms are compared with the architecture-independent version of the parameterized multicast algorithm and two other well-known network-dependent algorithms based on the binomial tree.

Reference-contexts: Our results have been collected from running these trees on our flit-level simulator. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6. 2 Construction of an Architecture Independent Multicast Tree 2.1 The Parameterized Communication Model The parameterized communication model is the extension of the LogP model <ref> [2] </ref>. Basically, the model involves five parameters: sending latency (t send ), receiving latency (t recv ), network latency (t net ), holding latency (t hold ), and end-to-end latency (t end ).

Reference-contexts: Our previous work investigated the problem of constructing an efficient and architecture-independent multicast algorithm [7]. Our findings indicated that the binomial mul-ticast tree, which is very popular and has been used as a basis in several multicast algorithms (e.g., U-mesh algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> and U-min algorithm [9]), may not be optimal in most systems when considering the actual implementation overhead and latency. Even worse, it may be outperformed in some networks by other multicast algorithms based on simple multicast trees such as a sequential tree [5]. <p> This can be done by ordering the node so that the contention can be avoided. The ordering scheme is architecture-dependent and will be discussed in the next two sections. 3 Optimal Multicast in Mesh Networks Constructing contention-free multicast trees on wormhole-routing mesh network was studied in <ref> [3] </ref>. Based on the dimension-ordered chain and recursive-doubling technique, U-mesh algorithm can construct an efficient contention-free multicast tree for a mesh network. Observe that U-mesh trees are binomial trees, and binomial trees are optimal only if they are implemented on networks with t hold = t end . <p> Based on the dimension-ordered chain and parameterized multicast tree, OPT-Mesh tree can construct a contention-free optimal multicast tree that matches network parameters. We base our proof on some notations and results discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. Algorithm 3.1 OPT-MESH Input: : dimension-ordered chain fx l ; x l+1 ; ; x r g for source and destinations. x s : the address of source node. j i : the size of the subtree containing the source, where i = r l + 1. <p> In this example, the multicast latency of the OPT-mesh tree is 130. Given the same timing parameters, the multicast latency of the U-mesh tree <ref> [3] </ref> is 165. Theorem 1 The implementation of parameterized multi-cast trees in meshes using the OPT-mesh algorithm is optimal. 4 Optimal Multicast in BMIN Networks The issue of contentions using the software multicast in multistage interconnection network with turnaround routing was discussed by Xu and Ni [9].

Reference-contexts: However, our contention-avoidance technique is not restricted to these two networks. This concept can be applied to any network as long as the underlying networks can be partitioned into contention-free processor clusters. In some networks, such as a butterfly unidirectional MIN, this partitioning may not be possible <ref> [4] </ref>. In this case, the best one can do is to minimize network contention as much as possible. Instead of preventing a common communication channel used by different senders at any time, some channels are allowed to be shared.

Reference-contexts: Even worse, it may be outperformed in some networks by other multicast algorithms based on simple multicast trees such as a sequential tree <ref> [5] </ref>. Our approach is based on the parameterized communication model. Each system is characterized by a small set of easily measurable parameters. By identifying a set of architecture-independent communication and system parameters, we proposed a multicast algorithm called OPT-tree which is truly portable and still provides good performance. <p> Observe that t hold represents the latency of invoking the send operation, and t end reflects the delay of delivering a message across the network. In <ref> [5] </ref>, we explain how to evaluate both t hold and t end at the user-application level. 2.2 Architecture-Independent Optimal Multicast Trees In this section, we give a brief review of our O (k) time algorithm to construct an optimal multicast tree of k nodes using two parameters t hold and t

Reference-contexts: We consider wormhole-switched mesh networks and bi-directional multistage interconnection networks (BMINs) which are popular in the market, such as the Intel Paragon and the IBM/SP series. Due to the limiting space, proofs, examples, and additional results can be found in our technical report <ref> [6] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the parameterized communication model as well as the construction of an architecture-independent multicast tree. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the contention-free implementation of the parameterized mul-ticast algorithm on wormhole-switched mesh networks and wormhole-switched BMINs, respectively. <p> Each data point presented in our results is the average of the multicast latency from all 16 experiments. Due to space limitation, details of our simulators and additional results can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. trees on a 16x16 mesh. In Figure 2, we measure the multicast latency of the three multicast trees (OPT-mesh, OPT-tree, and U-mesh) with 32 nodes. The OPT-mesh tree provides the best performance while the U-mesh tree performs the worst.

They proposed the U-min algorithm which can construct a binomial multicast tree without stepwise and depth contention. As mentioned earlier, the binomial tree is guaranteed to be optimal only if it is implemented on the network with t hold = t end . <p> Thus, the U-min tree is only a special case of parameterized multicast tree. To eliminate the overhead due to contentions, we propose an algorithm called OPT-min algorithm which tunes the parameterized multicast tree specifically for BMIN networks. The basic concept of OPT-min algorithm is based on the framework in <ref> [9] </ref>. Algorithm 4.1 OPT-MIN ALGORITHM Input: : lexicographic-ordered chain fx l ; x l+1 ; ; x r g for source and destinations. x s : the address of source node. j i : the size of the subtree containing the source, where i = r l + 1.
