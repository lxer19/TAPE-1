Abstract: We describe efficient constructions of small probability spaces that approximate the joint distribution of general random variables. Previous work on efficient constructions concentrate on approximations of the joint distribution for the special case of identical, uniformly distributed random variables.

In light of the above developments, we chose to omit all these results from the current write-up.
