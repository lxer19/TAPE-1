Reference-contexts: Since foil, one of the best learning algorithms with heuristic search, is unable to learn the intended concept descriptions, we need algorithms restricting capable of the hypothesis space by syntactical structures to lead the learning into areas of expected rules. 3.2 Grendel 3.2.1 General description of Grendel grendel <ref> [Cohen, 1991, Cohen, 1992, Cohen, 1993] </ref> is a learning algorithm based on foil. Representation language, search strategy, and hypothesis evaluation are identical. The important difference is the way grendel specializes hypotheses. This specialization can be determined by the user with a grammar explicitly defining the hypothesis space.

After each instantiation, 6 grendel expands a lazy macro A ! B where P by proving P and adding a grammar rule A !

Reference-contexts: We cancelled the experiment after a long time without having learned any rule. But the generated hypotheses look promising. 3.3 Rdt The last learning algorithm to be presented, rdt [Kietz and Wrobel, 1992], is based on ideas of <ref> [Emde, 1987] </ref>. rdt differs significantly from the two previously described algorithms. The representation formalism of mobal, into which rdt is integrated, is more powerful than foil's and grendel's, because negated literals are allowed to occur in the clauses.

Reference-contexts: To execute this kind of commands, the robot must be able to classify the objects it perceives with its sensors, i.e., to assign them to concepts. Additionally, the system must be able to perform actions with these objects like moving through the doorway of the door found. <ref> [Morik and Rieger, 1993] </ref> have shown that this requires perceptual features and action features to be integrated, and perceptual features to be action oriented and action features to be perception oriented. They developed a representation for these operational concepts based on first order logic. <p> Nevertheless, applying these algorithms to real systems like autonomous mobile robots is a another challenging task. In this paper, we will first present the representation of the perceptions of a mobile robot and a scenario used for learning, both developed by <ref> [Morik and Rieger, 1993] </ref>. In Section 3, we will describe three different learning algorithms of inductive logic programming, ILP, the research area of learning Horn clause programs. We will also describe the results we got from applying these learning algorithms to our learning tasks.

Reference-contexts: But we need a large number of rule schemata to solve the learning task. For the first task, we have one schema for each expected pattern length (see Figure 5). rdt orders the rule schemata by - subsumption <ref> [Plotkin, 1970, Plotkin, 1971] </ref>. This allows pruning, if a hypothesis is already too special to be accepted. But the used schemata are not comparable by -subsumption, none of two schemata is more general than the other. Therefore, exactly the same partial patterns were tested for each schema.

Reference-contexts: To handle this huge space, parts of it will be pruned semantically during learning by a heuristic. This heuristic leading search through the hypothesis space to find a short path to a good hypothesis, is the information gain, well-known from the propositional learner id3 <ref> [Quinlan, 1986] </ref>. foil's algorithm can be described as follows: while positive examples are still uncovered by the previously learned rules while negative examples are still covered by the recent hypothesis build all specializations of the recent hypothesis by extending the clause by a linked literal calculate the information gain for all

Reference-contexts: The other two algorithms 6 3 DIFFERENT ILP ALGORITHMS use different kinds of an explicit definition of the hypothesis space, so that it can be reduced. In the third algorithm, a complete search in the restricted hypothesis space will be performed. 3.1 Foil foil <ref> [Quinlan, 1990] </ref> is presently one of the most acknowledged ILP-algorithms.
