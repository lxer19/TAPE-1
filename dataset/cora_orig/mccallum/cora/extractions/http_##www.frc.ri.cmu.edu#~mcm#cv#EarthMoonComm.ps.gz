Abstract: Carnegie Mellon University has proposed an educational and entertainment-based robotic lunar mission which will last two years and cover 1000km on the moon and revisit several historic sites. With the transmission of live panoramic video, participants will be provided the opportunity for interactively exploring the moon through teleoperation and telepresence. The requirement of panoramic video and telepresence demands high data rates on the order of 7.5 Mbps. This is challenging since the power available for communication is approximately 100W and occupied bandwidth is limited to less than 10 MHz. The tough environment on the moon introduces additional challenges of survivability and reliability. A communication system based on a phased array antenna, Nyquist QPSK modulation and a rate 2/3 Turbo code is presented which can satisfy requirements of continuous high data rate communication at low power and bandwidth reliably over a two year mission duration. Three ground stations with 22m parabolic antennas are required around the world to maintain continuous communication. The transmission will then be relayed via satellite to the current control station location. This paper presents an overview of the mission, and communication requirements and design.

Reference-contexts: For this application a parabolic dish must be mechanically pointed with high precision, which is a major challenge from a moving rover. Phased Array: Although a less mature technology than parabolic dishes, phased arrays have matured greatly over the last couple years <ref> [3] </ref> and are beginning to see some ight tests. Phased arrays have several advantages. They are usually more efficient than parabolic reectors. Also, the beam may be electronically, rather than mechanically, pointed by adjusting the phases of the individual transmitters.

Reference-contexts: For the modulated rate of 11.25 MHz above, that would be a data rate of 5Mbps. Space qualified hardware already exists that implements the standard. Recently, however, a new way of interleaving recursive convolutional codes has been found that performs near theoretical limit ([2], <ref> [8] </ref>). These codes, called Turbo Codes, were discovered in 1993 and have been a hot research topic since.

Reference-contexts: Also, given the power constraints of the rover, the modulation method must also be power efficient. There are two techniques that meet the requirements of the Lunar Rover Initiative, Nyquist QPSK [11] and continuous phase modulation (CPM) ([1], <ref> [9] </ref>). With Nyquist QPSK, the power amplifier must be linear, which is less power efficient than one which operates in saturation only. The theoretically optimum bandwidth efficiency is 0.5 Hz/bps, however this isnt achievable in practice.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The Lunar Rover Initiative (LRI) <ref> [10] </ref>, undertaken by the Planetary Robotics Program at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, is chartered to place a robotic vehicle on the Moon before the year 2000. LRI has chosen a mission focused on providing entertainment and education, or edutainment, rather than the science agenda of traditional space exploration.

Reference-contexts: The maximum data rate is primarily limited by the bandwidth allocation. Frequency licensing is required from all the countries where earth stations will be installed. Frequency allocation usually takes time (2-3 years). Various bands (S, X, Ku, Ka) for space research <ref> [12] </ref> were considered and analyzed. With the limited power available at the rover, Ka-band does not serve the purpose due to very high rain attenuation. S-band and X-band are preferable due to low attenuation. Although Ku-band has higher attenuation than S-band and X-band it can be used.
