Reference-contexts: This is the standard use of "Abnormality" predicates: All rules have an extra assumption "and there is nothing abnormal" added, and the rule can thus be broken by adding the assumption that this particular case is abormal in some way <ref> [Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987] </ref>: X and "+ Abnormal (X) -&gt; Y f1 (X) -&gt; Abnormal (X) f2 (X) -&gt; Abnormal (X) : : : : : : : : : where the fi are initially assumed false (Closed World Assumption).

Reference-contexts: Knowing the principles underlying "shallow" rules in the KB may allow better explanations to be produced. The general form and example Murray gives in <ref> [Murray, 1990a] </ref> is: GIVEN A -&gt; B A -&gt; C, C -&gt; B THEN we can justify A -&gt; B by the chain A -&gt; C -&gt; B Example: leaf is green leaf contains chlorophyll -&gt; leaf contains green thing -&gt; leaf is green 4 4.2 Explanation-Based Generalization (EBG) Murray gives <p> The general form and the example from <ref> [Murray, 1990a] </ref> is: GIVEN X Reln Y -&gt; helps fulfil X's purpose (s) x1 Reln y1 ABDUCE ALL xi Reln y1.

Reference-contexts: Adding the assumption some fj (xi) is true allows the inference xi -&gt; yi to be retracted, rather than retracting the whole inference rule. Murray gives two examples of this in <ref> [Murray, 1990b] </ref> and [Murray and Porter, 1989], which we summarize (in simplified form) below. From [Murray, 1990b]: 3 Strictly, they may also introduce trivial concepts into the graph eg. numbers. <p> Adding the assumption some fj (xi) is true allows the inference xi -&gt; yi to be retracted, rather than retracting the whole inference rule.

Our goal here is to show how we can express the rules' complex logical expressions as graphs.
