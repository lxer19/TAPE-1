Reference-contexts: Furthermore, both TP4 and TCP are based on a connection-oriented paradigm of information transfer; real-time systems generally require a exible array of paradigms offered through the services of the communication subsystem, including datagrams and transactions. Of the experimental transport protocols, the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP, <ref> [CHER88] </ref>) and the Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP) both are designed for support of real-time systems, although neither explicitly provides performance guarantees. 2.2. Real-Time Communication Requirements In general, distributed systems must maintain two properties: safeness (nothing wrong can happen) and liveness (something good will eventually happen).

Reference-contexts: As such, XTP has generated a great deal of interest in such application areas as avionics systems ([COHN88a]), naval systems ([COHN88b], <ref> [MARL89] </ref>), and space systems ([WEAV89]). Since a specific design goal of XTP is for its algorithms to be implementable in VLSI, the chip-based XTP is expected to provide nearly MAC-layer performance at a transport layer interface ([CHES88]).

Reference-contexts: Rather, XTP offers simple, straight-forward priority queued processing. XTP does not impose an interpretation of this priority; if the 22 priority (as embodied in the sort field) is a deadline, then messages are handled in nearest deadline order. It is recognized in <ref> [STRA89] </ref> that a single priority field does not adequately convey all of the timing or other information about how important this message is. Of course, the sort field can be divided into two parts, one for the deadline and one for the criticalness, but this approach is user-defined.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, XTPs design is highly parallelizable, so the need to preempt processing is not as acute. Since the Communication Manager provides similar message processing functionality as a transport protocol, an XTP-based communication subsystem would probably not need a full-scale Communication Manager as described in <ref> [TOKU89] </ref>. 6. Conclusions The ARTS distributed real-time operating system uses timing information, especially period and worst-case execution time, to schedule its tasks. It attempts to guarantee the hard real-time tasks first, then reduce the response time on the soft real-time tasks.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The ARTS operating system ([TOKU89], <ref> [TOKU90] </ref>) is a distributed real-time operating system designed for the Advanced Real-Time Technology (ART) testbed at Carnegie-Mellon University. The goal of the ARTS system is to provide users with a predictable, analyzable, and reliable distributed real-time computing environment. <p> The testbed over which ARTS is implemented uses both an Ethernet 9 and IEEE 802.5 Token Ring for the physical and media access control layers of the network. 3.3.1. Requirements The requirements for real-time communication subsystem, as derived from <ref> [TOKU90] </ref>, are the following: The subsystem should provide a mechanism for handling the timing requirement of the message traffic. Since real-time systems rely on fine priority granularity to make guarantees about system performance, this priority granularity should be extended to the communication subsystem. <p> The time fence value is discussed below. The message descriptor includes information about the message. This structure is shown as it is given in <ref> [TOKU90] </ref>. typedef struct MSGD - MSG_TYPE m_type; /* message type */ u_short m_pri; /* message priority */ MSG_ADDR m_addr; /* message address */ u_long m_size; /* message size */ u_long m_errorno; /* invocation error code */ - MSGD; The m_type field indicates whether the message is LONG or SHORT, where LONG
