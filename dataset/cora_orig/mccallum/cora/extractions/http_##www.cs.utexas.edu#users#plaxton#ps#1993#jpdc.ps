Abstract: MIT in 1977, and his Ph.D. from the Technical University in Munich in 1980. He was then a visiting scientist at MIT and Stanford, and from 1982 through 1988 on the faculty of the Stanford Computer Science Department. Since 1988, he is Professor for Theoretical Computer Science at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University in Frankfurt, Germany. His interests are combinatorial algorithms, parallel algorithms, and complexity theory.
