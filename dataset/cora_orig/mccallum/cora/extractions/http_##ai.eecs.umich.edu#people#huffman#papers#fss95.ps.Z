Title: A navigation assistant for data source selection and integration  
Author: Scott B. Huffman and David Steier Price Waterhouse

Abstract: We describe an intelligent assistant that is being designed to help information specialists select and combine data sources to produce new information services. Rather than fully planning out and answering queries autonomously, the assistant will provide interactive knowledge-based support for a specialist designing a query plan. The assistant uses heuristics and constraints to help its user navigate through a potentially large set of data sources to locate those needed to produce a desired information service.

Reference-contexts: A number of researchers are building systems that act as complete query processors for end users: the user enters a query in some global representation language, and the system plans, optimizes, and executes a query across multiple heterogeneous sources to answer the query. SIMS <ref> [Arens et al., 1993] </ref> and the Information Manifold [Kirk et al., 1995] are good examples of this type of system. QPEA's goal is different: rather than attempting to autonomously construct a full query plan and execute it, QPEA uses its knowledge to assist a specialist constructing such a plan. <p> This central vocabulary is also be used by the user to specify content. Such an ontology is a standard element of agents that interact with multiple heterogeneous sources. For instance, SIMS <ref> [Arens et al., 1993] </ref> uses LOOM to represent a global ontology; the Information Manifold uses CLASSIC [Kirk et al., 1995]; and the Stanford Information Brokers project uses KIF/Ontolingua and context logic [Dappert et al., 1995]. 2. Source meta-information. <p> The planning techniques we implement will be somewhat similar to those used by Sage in SIMS <ref> [Arens et al., 1993] </ref>, but using a heuristic set of query operators, and allowing the initial plan to be partially specified ahead of time. Also, we will not initially focus on query plan optimizations, such as those de scribed in [Knoblock and Levy, 1995]. 5. Graphical user interface.

Source meta-information. QPEA must have knowledge about available data sources: both what information they contain (cast in terms of the global vocabulary); and meta properties such as access cost, accuracy, and timeliness of data.

Reference-contexts: Rather, we are focusing on providing them with "power tools" that will increase their productivity. Because QPEA uses knowledge about data sources to help a user identify sources for a query, it is also related to "information broker" or "mediator" agents that contain repositories of source information <ref> [Fikes et al., 1995; Wiederhold, 1992] </ref>. However, these broker/mediator agents are typically designed either to interact with other information agents, or with an end user who has a query and wants an answer.

Reference-contexts: Heuristic relational query operators. QPEA aids in constructing query plans that contain heuristic relational query operators in addition to regular relational operators. For instance, in addition to regular equi-joins, QPEA can plan for a heuristic join <ref> [Huffman and Steier, 1995] </ref> across sources that refer to the same ontological category (e.g. company, person, etc.) in different ways.

Reference-contexts: We have recently developed a data source of high-level corporate management changes, that contains tuples reporting a date, company name, person's name, and position they have obtained (e.g. "CEO"). This source is constructed automatically using an information extraction system <ref> [Huffman, 1995] </ref> that scans newswire articles. Thus, it is not 100% accurate or complete. In addition, since names of companies and people are drawn directly from newswire text, they do not follow any uniform format.

QPEA will interact with information specialists using a graphical representation of the query/service being produced. This is illustrated in the next section. A QPEA Scenario: Selecting management changes As a simple example of using QPEA, consider the following (real) problem.

Reference-contexts: The user may specify more or less about the service and input databases. (A companion paper, <ref> [Steier et al., 1995] </ref>, provides a case study of the kinds of meta-information users might wish to specify, based on those observed in real-world business data integration problems). To perform this task, QPEA must include the fol lowing components: 1. Domain ontology.
