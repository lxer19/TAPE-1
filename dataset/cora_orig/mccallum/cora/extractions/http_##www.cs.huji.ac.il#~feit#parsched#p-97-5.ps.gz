Abstract: In this paper we have characterized the inter-arrival time and service time distributions for jobs at a large MPP supercomputing center. Our findings show that the distributions are dispersive and complex enough that they require Hyper Erlang distributions to capture the first three moments of the observed workload. We also present the parameters from the characterization so that they can be easily used for both theoretical studies and the simulations of various scheduling algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The Erlang distribution, like the exponential distribution, has an underlying Markovian process, thus making it attractive for use in queuing theory. The Erlang distribution can represent more types of systems than the exponential distribution can. Finally in 1955, Cox, in a seminal paper <ref> [7] </ref>, demonstrated that the key advan-tage of the Erlang and the exponential distributions for analytical work stems from the fact that their Laplace transforms are rational.

Reference-contexts: This involves solving 3 simultaneous equations with 3 unknowns. The analytical expression for the three parameters has been derived by Johnson and Taaffe <ref> [9] </ref>. In general, an infinite number of n's can fit the data, while satisfying equations 17 and 18. We select the smallest such n.
