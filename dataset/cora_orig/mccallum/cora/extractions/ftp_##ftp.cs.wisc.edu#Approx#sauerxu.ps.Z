Abstract: Use of a new notion of multivariate divided difference leads to a short proof of a formula by Sauer and Xu for the error in interpolation, by polynomials of total degree n in d variables, at a `correct' point set. In [3], Sauer and Xu consider interpolation from the space n (R d ) of d-variate polynomials of degree n at a point set X which is correct for it in the sense that, for an arbitrary g, there is exactly one p 2 n (R d ), denoted here by
