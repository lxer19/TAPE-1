Abstract: Birds, fish, and many other animals travel as a flock, school, or herd. Animals in these groups must remain in close proximity while avoiding collisions with neighbors and with obstacles. We would like to reproduce this behavior for groups of artificial creatures with significant dynamics. In this paper we describe an algorithm for creatures that move as a group and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with three simulated systems: legged robots, human-like bicycle riders, and point-mass systems. Both the legged robots and the bicyclists are dynamic simulations that must control balance, facing direction, and forward speed as well as movement with the group. The point-mass systems have minimal dynamics and are included to facilitate our understanding of the effects of the dynamics on the performance of the algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Arkin explored the question of communication in a group of interacting mobile robots using schema-based reactive control ([1] and <ref> [2] </ref>). Example schemas are move-to-goal, move-ahead, and avoid-static-obstacle. Each behavior computes a velocity vector that is combined with the vectors from other behaviors. Arkin demonstrated that for some tasks robots can interact with no communication other than observations of the environment or with very limited explicit communication.

Reference-contexts: These control laws leave the motion of several joints of the bicyclist unspecified. The wrists and the waist are held at a constant angle with proportional-derivative controllers. The ankle joints are controlled to match data recorded from humans <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Groupings exemplify an attraction that modulates the desire of each member to join the group with the desire to maintain a sufficient distance from nearby creatures [12]. As an example of this attraction, Cullen, Shaw, and Baldwin <ref> [4] </ref> report that the density of fish is approximately equal in all planes of the school, as if each fish had a sphere around its head with which it wished to contact the sphere of another fish.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm used to calculate the properties of the polygonal model integrates over the set of tetrahedra formed by the triangular faces of the model and the origin <ref> [6] </ref>. Density data obtained from the anatomical literature were used in calculating the dynamic properties of the body segments. The degrees of freedom of the bicycle model are shown in figure 6.

Reference-contexts: These robots, like Arkin's, do not explicitly communicate state or goals and the system has no leaders. This work demonstrated that combinations of such simple behaviors as attraction and repulsion can produce complex relationships such as dispersion and flocking in physical robots in the laboratory ([7] and <ref> [8] </ref>). Group Behaviors The algorithms for group behaviors described in this paper were evaluated on three simulated systems: a one-legged robot, a rigid body model of a human riding a bicycle, and a point-mass system with minimal dynamics.

Reference-contexts: To increase the speed, the foot is positioned closer to the hip. To decrease the speed, the foot is positioned further from the hip. The details of the locomotion control algorithms are given in Raibert <ref> [9] </ref>. The reference angles of the model are shown in figure 4. The desired position computed by the algorithms for group behaviors is used to compute a desired velocity. <p> The parameters for the one-legged robot are similar to those of robots that have been built <ref> [9] </ref>, but the parameters for the bicyclist match those for a human and are superior to the materials available for robot construction. We have not explored the question of how the algorithms will perform on a heterogeneous population.

Reference-contexts: The success of behaviors such as these in biological systems makes it reasonable to assume that it would be advantageous to reproduce them in robotic systems. Early work in the simulation of group behaviors was performed by Reynolds <ref> [10] </ref>. Actors in his system are bird-like objects similar to point-masses except that each bird also has an orientation. The birds maintain position and orientation within the flock by balancing three desires: avoiding collisions with neighbors, matching the velocity of nearby neighbors, and moving towards the center of the flock.

Reference-contexts: The equations of motion for the robot and the bicyclist were formulated using a commercially available package <ref> [11] </ref>. The equations of motion for the individuals in the group do not take into account the physical effects of collisions between two members of the group, although collisions are detected and a count of collisions is recorded for use in analyzing the data.

Reference-contexts: Their system first constructs a global plan without taking into account moving obstacles. When a collision is imminent, the system locally replans using in-terrobot communication to resolve the conflict. This solution reduces the communication overhead associated with group behaviors. Sugihara and Suzuki <ref> [13] </ref> demonstrated that robots can form stable formations without a priori knowledge about the total number of robots when each robot executes an identical algorithm for determining position within the group. Wang [15] investigated the asymptotic stability of multiple robots in formation.

Reference-contexts: Formations are represented as a set of offsets from a predefined reference robot. In this way, a formation can be directly defined as a set of positions for each robot relative to the leader, the closest neighbor, or set of closest neighbors. Takeuchi, Unuma, and Amakawa <ref> [14] </ref> implemented path planning in simulated multiagent systems where the attraction between agents is dependent on properties of the agents. The simulated agents are point-masses where forces are applied to the agents based on the vector sum of attractions to observable agents.

Wang <ref> [15] </ref> investigated the asymptotic stability of multiple robots in formation. Each robot in the model is simulated as a point mass and perceives other robots in a cone-shaped region in the direction of travel.

Reference-contexts: Reynolds's work demonstrated that realistic-looking animations of group formations can be created by applying simple rules to determine the behaviors of the individuals in the flock. Yeung and Bekey <ref> [16] </ref> proposed a decentralized approach to the navigation problem for multiple agents. Their system first constructs a global plan without taking into account moving obstacles. When a collision is imminent, the system locally replans using in-terrobot communication to resolve the conflict.

Reference-contexts: Herding benefits group members by limiting the average number of encounters with predators (data summarized in Veherencamp <ref> [17] </ref>). Group behaviors also allow animals to hunt more powerful animals than those they could overpower as individuals. The success of behaviors such as these in biological systems makes it reasonable to assume that it would be advantageous to reproduce them in robotic systems.
