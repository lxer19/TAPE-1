Abstract: Term project report for the course Broadband Networks offered by Professor Kenneth Vastola. Abstract This project report discusses the various proposals for running IP over ATM and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each compared to the other. First the basic philosophy of running a network layer protocol over another network layer protocol and the options available to do the same are detailed. Of the two models presented, the peer model having certain inherent disadvantages makes the overlay model a more suitable choice for implementing IP over ATM. Next the various packet encapsulation schemes proposed for the IP over ATM goal, like LLC/SNAP, VC-multiplexing, TULIP, TUNIC, etc., are discussed. It is noted that the LLC/SNAP encapsulation is the most popular encapsulation scheme as it is the least inhibitive and allows the maximum multiplexing onto a single VC. Next the various models like the Classical IP model and the NHRP model are discussed as candidates for the implementation of IP over ATM. Further more general models and protocols like the LANE protocol for LAN emulation and the Integrated P-NNI model for an integrated services network and the MPOA protocol for establishing Layer 3 virtual LANs are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Details of the P-NNI routing are not covered in this report and are available in <ref> [1] </ref>. It is called Integrated services as it is the best candidate for an integrated services Internet envisioned by IPng, as it supports the Quality of Service guarantees represented by RSVP and integrates well with ATM backbones.
