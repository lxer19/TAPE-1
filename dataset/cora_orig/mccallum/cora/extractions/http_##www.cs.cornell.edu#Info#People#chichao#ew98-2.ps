Reference-contexts: However, there are several problems with this approach. First, the actual pricing mechanism implemented in existing and proposed systems seems to invariably be either cheap to implement but rather arbitrary [ 3] or more realistic auction-based but with high-overheads. For example, Edell et al. <ref> [ 1] </ref> propose a system that enables billing users for their TCP traffic but it increases the average connection setup time by 66%. A second issue is who actually funds applications in economy-based resource management environments.

Reference-contexts: Instead, it is often possible to trade one resource for another one and continue to provide the same quality of service. In this paper, we focus on a Java-based system, the J-Kernel <ref> [ 2] </ref>, which supports the execution of untrusted code, called servlets 1 , in servers. The servlets can be stored on the server itself or they can be uploaded dynamically by users in order to customize the server functionality.

If it is the system, then the accumulation of money over periods of inactivity must be dealt with. Some systems propose a form of taxation <ref> [3] </ref>, but the formulas used are again rather arbitrary. If the user funds the applications based on real money the pricing and its evolution must be easy to understand. Most current services appear to quickly converge on flat rates. However, introducing flat rates actually defeats the purpose of economics-based models.

Reference-contexts: system should provide the necessary information so that servlets can adjust their behavior to take advantage of possible resource tradeoffs, as described below. 6 A critique of economics-based approach to resource management A number of research projects advocate the use of economical models to force applications to compete for resources <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach may seem ideal for Internet systems. In fact, there is an unquestionable merit to bidding for resources prioritizing applications according to the amount of funding they have, which should in turn reflect the relative importance of different tasks. However, there are several problems with this approach.
