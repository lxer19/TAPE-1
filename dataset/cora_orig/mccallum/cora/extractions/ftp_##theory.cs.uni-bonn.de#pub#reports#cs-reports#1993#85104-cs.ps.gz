Abstract: It is a fundamental open problem in the randomized computation how to separate different randomized time or randomized small space classes (cf., e.g., [KV 87], [KV 88]). In this paper we study lower space bounds for randomized computation, and prove lower space bounds up to log n for the specific sets computed by the Monte Carlo Turing machines. This enables us for the first time, to separate randomized space classes below log n (cf. [KV 87], [KV 88]), allowing us to separate, say, the randomized space O (1) from the randomized space O (log fl n). We prove also lower space bounds up to log log n and log n, respectively, for specific languages computed by probabilistic Turing machines, and one-way probabilistic Turing machines.

Reference-contexts: It appears now that these algorithms are more efficient than the purely deterministic ones in terms of running time, hardware size, circuits depth, etc. The advantages of randomized Turing machines over deterministic machines have been studied early starting with <ref> [Fr 75] </ref> where the sets of palindromes were proved to be computed by Monte Carlo off-line Turing machines much faster than by the deterministic machines of the same type.

Reference-contexts: This can be done in space k. Finally, the machine deterministically recognizes whether the assertions (i)-(ii) hold. No more than logarithmic (in jvj) space is needed for this. The Assertion 2) is a corollary from Theorem 2.2. 2 M. Karpinski and R. Verbeek <ref> [KV 87] </ref> have shown that there are many small functions which are self-constructible for space complexity of 2-way Monte Car-lo Turing machines. Among these functions one should mention log log : : : log n (repeated arbitrarily many times), log fl n, the inverse Ackermann function.
