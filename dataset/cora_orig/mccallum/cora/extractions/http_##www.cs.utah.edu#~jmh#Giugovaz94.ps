Reference-contexts: Thus there would be three unsensed freedoms at the endpoint, similar to the case of a ball joint except that the axes will not all intersect. Second, the fixed parameters that were used in Table 1 may not be exact. We plan to employ open-loop calibration <ref> [1] </ref> to check on these parameters and to verify the closed-loop results. Third, the fixture used is very stiff, but it is more flexible than the arm.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it is necessary to define a force control strategy, which permits manipulator pose changes in compliance with a constrained end effector and initially incorrect kinematic parameters. In a previous implementation on the fingers of the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand <ref> [2] </ref>, the fingers were manually placed into different poses and advantage was taken of the backdrivability of the finger joints. For the Sarcos Dextrous Arm, which is a hydraulic ma nipulator, an active force control strategy is required to move the joints.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the past, we proposed the closed-loop kinematic calibration method <ref> [3] </ref>, which permits a manipulator to be calibrated without endpoint sensing. In this method, a manipulator forms a mobile closed kinematic chain by attachment of the end effector to the environment. This attachment may be rigid or may have up to 5 unsensed degrees of freedom. <p> In order to make this joint mobile, and hence to identify the parameters associated with this joint, it is necessary to free at least one of the end effector constraints. One way is to add an external unsensed hinge joint; this situation was analyzed in <ref> [3] </ref> and a procedure was given to eliminate the hinge joint angle from the loop closure equations. In addition, it is necessary to define a force control strategy, which permits manipulator pose changes in compliance with a constrained end effector and initially incorrect kinematic parameters. <p> In [5], a fiducial point on the end effector is touched to a fiducial point on the environment in several different poses; this corresponds to the point contact case in <ref> [3] </ref>. In [12], a teleoperated excavator with un-sensed joints was calibrated by adding an additional linkage (called a calibrator by the authors) with some sensed joints to form a closed loop. In [7], a ball bar with fixed length and unsensed spherical joints at each end was employed. <p> Experiments on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm are then presented. 2 Methodology The Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) convention is employed for the geometric parameters (Figure 1). In the present case, Hayati coordinates are not required because the Sarcos Dextrous Arm has all neighboring joints orthogonal. The subsequent development is taken from <ref> [3] </ref>. Lydia Giugovaz and John M. <p> Using differential rotation about orthogonal axis rather than non-orthogonal Euler angles, we have r i = [@x i ; @y i ; @z i ] T . The relation between both are given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The Jacobians are then found by screw axis analysis as in [3]. 2.2 Closed-Loop Calibration with Fixed Endpoint We next consider a redundant manipulator ( 7 DOFs) with fixed end-point. <p> Using differential rotation about orthogonal axis rather than non-orthogonal Euler angles, we have r i = [@x i ; @y i ; @z i ] T .

Generally, the resulting closed-loop chain will be mobile, since the fixed endpoint constraints only 6 of the 7 DOFs of the manipulator.

Reference-contexts: In [14], a line constraint was defined by a laser, which was tracked using an endpoint retroreflector on a PUMA 560 and a 4-quadrant detector.

Reference-contexts: For example, the hinge joint was positioned such that neither joint 7 nor joint 1 were parallel to it. (Parallel adjacent joints would require Hayati parameters during a numerical calibration <ref> [9] </ref>). The following force control strategy was used to move the constrained arm. With rigid attachment of the endpoint to the environment through a hinge joint, the redundant Sarcos Dextrous Arm with 7 DOFs will form a mobile closed kinematic chain with 2 DOFs.

Reference-contexts: In a least-squares analysis on the endpoint pose error, position errors and orientation errors have to be combined. It has been argued that for arm lengths of around one meter, then the units of meters and radians are directly comparable <ref> [10] </ref>. Hence task variable scaling is not performed. Column scaling is performed for the parameters [13]. With regard to identifiability and pose selection, after scaling and for the experiment done and the pose set selected, we obtained a condition number of 28.

Reference-contexts: By placing such a constrained manipulator into a number of poses, the kinematic parameters may be calibrated using joint angle sensing alone and the loop closure equations. This paper presents an experimental implementation of closed-loop kinematic calibration on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm, a 7-DOF redundant manipulator <ref> [11] </ref>. With rigid attachment of the endpoint to the environment, the Sarcos Dextrous Arm will form a mobile closed kinematic chain with 1 DOF. Unfortunately, this anthropomorphic arm will have an immobile elbow joint during this motion.

At the moment, we have not implemented an independent test to verify the identified parameters.
