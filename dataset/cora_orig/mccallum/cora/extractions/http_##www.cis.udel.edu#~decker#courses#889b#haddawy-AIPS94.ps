Reference-contexts: Each branch is a conditional probability statement. For example, the first branch means that P (e 11 jA^c 1 ) = p 11 . This representation is similar to that used by Hanks <ref> (Hanks 1990) </ref>. World Model The state of the world is represented with a probability distribution over a set of attributes. Attributes may be symbolic or quantitative. For simplicity, we assume that all the attributes are probabilistically independent.

Reference-contexts: The action descriptions are organized into an abstraction/decomposition network, which is described later. A plan is a sequence of actions. So the planning task is to find the sequence of actions that maximizes expected utility relative to the given probability and utility models. Abstracting Actions We extend Tenenberg's <ref> (Tenenberg 1991) </ref> notion of inheritance abstraction for STRIPS operators to apply to conditional probabilistic actions.
