Title: OPTIMIZATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER PCx User Guide: Windows 95/NT Supplement 1  
Author: by Joseph Czyzyk, Magdalena Stolarski, and Stephen J. Wright 
Date: April 28, 1997  
Pubnum: Technical Report OTC 97/03  
Abstract: We describe the installation and use of the Windows 95/NT version of PCx, the primal-dual interior-point code for linear programming. This document is a supplement to the PCx User Guide, which describes the Unix version of the code. The current version number is 1.0. Key words: linear programming, interior-point methods, software, Windows 95/NT.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction PCx is a linear programming solver developed at the Optimization Technology Center at Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University. Instructions for downloading, installing and using the Unix version of PCx can be found in the PCx User Guide <ref> [1] </ref>. Most of the material in the Guide remains relevant to the Windows 95/NT version of the code. The main difference from the user's point of view is in the process of inputting parameters to override the default setting. <p> A click on this button will produce a window with the current parameter settings displayed in various fields, which may be edited by the user. An explanation of the significance of the various parameters can be found in <ref> [1, Section 6] </ref>. See Table 1 for the correspondence between the parameter keywords of [1] and the field names in the OPTIONS window. Click OK to fix the modified parameters and return control to the operating window. <p> An explanation of the significance of the various parameters can be found in [1, Section 6]. See Table 1 for the correspondence between the parameter keywords of <ref> [1] </ref> and the field names in the OPTIONS window. Click OK to fix the modified parameters and return control to the operating window. Subsequent uses of SOLVE in the session will make use of the modified parameters, which can be changed between solves. <p> For the same reason, PCxwindows.specs should not be modified directly by the user while a PCx session is in progress. 2 Keyword in <ref> [1] </ref> Field name in OPTIONS window boundname Bound Name cachesize Cache size centerexp Exponent for Centering Parameter dualfeastol Dual Feasibility Tolerance HOCorrections Perform Higher-Order Corrections? inputdirectory No equivalent iterationlimit Iteration Limit max Maximization MaxCorrections Maximum Corrections min Minimization objectivename Objective Cost Name opttol Optimality Tolerance preprocess Presolve? presolve Presolve? prifeastol Primal
