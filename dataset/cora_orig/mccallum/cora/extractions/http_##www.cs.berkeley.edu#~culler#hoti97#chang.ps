Abstract: This paper describes the design of a novel CMOS 2 Gb/s asymmetric serial link. The serial link is designed for systems that use high speed chip-to-chip communications. In such designs, power dissipation is a common problem, particularly when multiple serial links are required on one chip. The power arises primarily from the phase adjustment circuitry used to align data with the clock. This circuitry is usually placed at the receiver, but in our asymmetric link design we take a different approach. We first assume that a link consists of two unidirectional connections one for each direction of the link. We move the phase adjustment circuitry from one end of the link to the other, adjusting the phase of the transmitter rather than the receiver. Although this does not reduce overall system power, it allows us to choose the location of the phase adjustment circuitry, moving it from chips with a large number of links to chips with a smaller number. The link was designed for use in the Tiny Tera packet switch, which has a crossbar switch at its center. Simulations suggests that the power dissipation of serial links on the crossbar switch can be reduced by a factor of 4.

Reference-contexts: For example, the receiver clock is early when the timing sample is zero for a zero-to-one transition. Two identical receivers driven by two different clocks with 90 o phase shift can be used for separately sampling data and timing <ref> [1] </ref>. However, because of phase errors resulting from receiver and clock buffer mismatches, it is difficult to ensure that the data and timing sampling points are exactly 90 o apart. The mismatch means that the data sampling point would not be in the center of the bit time.

Reference-contexts: IV. IMPLEMENTATION A. Clock Generation The clock generation circuit is a dual-loop PLL with digitally controlled phase adjusters [4]. The inner loop is a four-stage VCO-based PLL. The VCO uses differential elements with symmetric loads and replica biasing <ref> [2] </ref> to generate eight clock phases, which are 45 o of a half-bit-rate clock cycle apart. Each phase adjuster selects two adjacent clock phases and uses a digitally-controlled interpolator to generate one of 17 finer phases between them.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, on the smart end, a dual-loop PLL with digitally controlled phase adjusters <ref> [4] </ref> generates phase-locked transmitter and receiver clocks. The link transmits a fixed repeating frame structure, consisting of multiple bytes. <p> Each calibration frame only changes the clock by one phase based on a majority vote of the early/late signals generated from the timing bytes.

Reference-contexts: With the output transistor gates driven to Vdd, the output can only drop to Vdd-Vt before the linear region is entered and the output resistance drops quickly. However, differential receivers have been shown to operate below 10 -13 BER with as little as 200 mV of input <ref> [5] </ref>, so larger swing is not needed. D. Receivers The receiver must achieve a very low bit error rate on a low swing, high bandwidth signal in the presence of supply noise and reections. <p> D. Receivers The receiver must achieve a very low bit error rate on a low swing, high bandwidth signal in the presence of supply noise and reections. The use of fully differential circuitry provides excellent supply noise rejection, and the use of integrating receivers <ref> [5] </ref> rejects high frequency reections and other noise. Two receivers operate on alternate bits in parallel, synchronized by the half-bit-rate clock. V. SIMULATION RESULTS A test chip has been designed and is being fabricated with Texas Instruments 0.25mm CMOS technology.
