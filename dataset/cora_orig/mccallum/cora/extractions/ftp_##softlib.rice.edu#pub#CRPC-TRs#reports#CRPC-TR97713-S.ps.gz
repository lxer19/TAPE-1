Title: A New Deflation Criterion for the QR Algorithm  
Author: Mario Ahues Fran~coise Tisseur 
Date: January 14, 1997  
Abstract: We present a new deflation criterion for the multishift QR algorithm motivated by convergence analysis for the basic QR algorithm. The performance of the criterion is illustrated by numerical experiments using the LAPACK implementation of the double-shift QR algorithm.

Reference-contexts: It therefore seems better to have a criterion that compares the subdiagonal elements to their neighboring diagonal elements. Most of the practical implementations of the QR algorithm (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, [4]) use a deflation criterion proposed by Wilkinson [2]. <p> Our deflation criterion is that both (3.1) and (1.1) are satisfied, where the latter condition is imposed so as to ensure that backward stability of the algorithm is maintained. This criterion can be easily implemented in LAPACK <ref> [1] </ref> by modifying the routine xLAHQR.

At iteration k, the element in position (i; i 1) of the iterated Hessenberg matrix H is set to zero if jh i;i1 j u (jh i1;i1 j + jh i;i j): (1.2) Note that if this criterion is satisfied then the more crude criterion (1.1) is automatically satisfied. <p> This criterion can be easily implemented in LAPACK [1] by modifying the routine xLAHQR.

Reference-contexts: With the use of the criterion (1.1), the QR algorithm is backward stable [6]. Stewart <ref> [5] </ref> notes, however, that this criterion is unsatisfactory for graded matrices of the form illustrated by A = B @ 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 6 10 8 10 10 10 12 C A ; for which some of the eigenvalues may be much smaller than ukAk
