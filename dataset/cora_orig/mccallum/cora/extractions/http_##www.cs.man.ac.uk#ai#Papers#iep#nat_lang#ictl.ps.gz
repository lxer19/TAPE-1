Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between temporal logic and the semantics of some temporal expressions in English. Specifically, we show how the meanings of English temporal preposition-phrases can be expressed as modal operators in an interval-based temporal logic which we call ETL0. We show how cascaded temporal preposition phrases and temporal preposition phrases with complex complements can be translated into ETL0. Finally, we present a decision-procedure for ETL0 and establish its correctness. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a characterization, in terms familiar to modal logicians, of the expressive resources made available by an important class of temporal expressions in English.

Reference-contexts: The semantics of tensed expressions are notoriously complicated (references are too numerous to cite; for a recent survey, see <ref> [11] </ref>), but, simplifying somewhat, we may take sentence (1) to state that Mary kissed John at some time within some (contextually determined) period, which we call the time of interest (toi).

Reference-contexts: There is now a great deal of interest in the development of logics specialized for (various aspects of) natural language (see, for example [1],[3],[7]; for an earlier reference, see <ref> [12] </ref>), and the present paper falls into this tradition.
