Abstract: Co-evolution can give rise to the "Red Queen effect", where interacting populations alter each other's fitness landscapes. The Red Queen effect significantly complicates any measurement of co-evolutionary progress, introducing fitness ambiguities where improvements in performance of co-evolved individuals can appear as a decline or stasis in the usual measures of evolutionary progress. Unfortunately, no appropriate measures of fitness given the Red Queen effect have been developed in artificial life, theoretical biology, population dynamics, or evolutionary genetics. We propose a set of appropriate performance measures based on both genetic and behavioral data, and illustrate their use in a simulation of co-evolution between genetically specified continuous-time noisy recurrent neural networks which generate pursuit and evasion behaviors in autonomous agents.

Reference-contexts: A relatively complex `morphogenesis' process translates the genotype into the agent's body morphology: the body has simple effectors, visual sensors, and a recurrent continuous-time dynamic artificial neural network whose parameters (connectivity, weights, thresholds, time-constants, etc) are determined by the genotype. Rather than using variable-length genotypes (e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) to allow evolutionary control of the number of artificial neurons in the network, sequences of the fixed-length genotype are ignored in morphogenesis unless they are preceded by an appropriate `marker sequence' which enables their expression: thus some portions of each genotype may be active (i.e. expressed in morphogenesis) while others

Reference-contexts: functions for determining the reproductive success of individuals, the fitness landscapes will vary over time as adaptations in one population warp and shift and deform the fitness landscape of the other. 2.2 Simulation Methods Brief details of our simulation system were given in [13], and full details are available in <ref> [3] </ref>. We will give here here only enough detail to establish the context for discussion of the problems of measuring co-evolutionary progress. The simulation uses a conventional generational (as opposed to steady-state) genetic algorithm (GA). <p> Reproduction uses mutation, a stochastic multipoint crossover operator, and a translocation operator: see <ref> [3] </ref>. Elitism is used in the breeding phase (i.e. the newly bred population receives an unadul-terated copy of the most fit genotype from the previous generation, located at the same grid position as before). <p> The differences in the scoring techniques mean that the contests are not zero-sum. See <ref> [3] </ref> for further discussion of this and other fitness scoring methods. At the end of each generation, various statistics are calculated in order to monitor progress.

Reference-contexts: more technically, using artificial co-evolution to develop neural-network sensory-motor architectures for controlling robot-like autonomous virtual pursuers which chase autonomous virtual evaders around a 2-dimensional (2-D) space, generating pursuit and/or evasion strategies on the basis of simulated visual input. 3 An expanded version of this paper, with full illustrations, is available <ref> [4] </ref>. We have argued for the importance of studying these pursuit-evasion contests in previous papers [13, 12]. For the purposes of this methodological paper, we can simply note that pursuit-evasion contests offer a prime scenario for studying co-evolutionary dynamics. <p> Two techniques are introduced below: "elite bitmaps" and "ancestral Hamming maps"; a third technique,"consensus distance plots", is described in <ref> [4] </ref>. All three techniques analyze one population in isolation from any other co-evolving populations: the intention is to identify periods of significant genetic change which can clarify features present in the ciao data. <p> For brevity, we illustrate these techniques with examples generated using only the pursuer population from the experiment analyzed in the previous sections: in practice it is necessary to separately apply these monitoring techniques to both the pursuer and the evader populations: see <ref> [4] </ref> for illustration of the results of applying these techniques to the evader population. Another technique we are exploring is chronospeciation analysis: testing whether successful offspring result from crossing individuals of generation g with individuals from generation g g. <p> The consensus sequence for the population can be thought of as the "average" genotype in the population. The rationale for these plots, and illustration of their use on data from the above experiment, are given in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5 Conclusion Co-evolutionary simulations for developing advanced artificial autonomous agents are so complex that new techniques for monitoring progress are required.

Reference-contexts: The Red Queen question is a microcosm of the ancient debate over the links between evolution, life, teleology, and progress. Testing the significance of the Red Queen has proven difficult. The fossil record provides only ambiguous evidence of co-evolutionary progress <ref> [7] </ref>, and fossils may not reveal the bodily and behavioral innovations that are important in most co-evolutionary scenarios. Simple population genetics models may over-estimate the smoothness of co-evolution by neglecting phylogenetic and developmental constraints that keep lineages stuck in local optima while their competitors surge ahead.

Reference-contexts: An alternative method of setting the gray-scales is to normalize all scores in each row in the image to the range of the data in that row. The effect on the image is similar to histogram-equalization used for contrast enhancement in image processing (e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>), but here the adjustment of gray-scales on each row has a natural interpretation: the darkest cell in each row signifies the highest score for the elite in P 2 of the generation plotted on that row, and the lightest the worst.

Reference-contexts: In fact, because the space of possible behaviors for our artificial agents is continuous in both time and space, a precise definition of what constitutes a `trait' is problematic. Although Kauffman's work on co-evolution in N KC fitness landscapes (e.g. <ref> [10, Chapter 6] </ref>) appears relevant, it is not clear how to determine N , K, or C for our simulations, 5 particularly as all three factors could vary dynamically as co-evolution progresses.

Reference-contexts: Co-evolving pursuit and evasion strategies may appear related to the long-established literature on theoretical modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. Yet all such work with which we are familiar, from the well-known deterministic Lotka-Volterra equations to the more recent spatially-distributed stochastic population models (see e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>), depends on monitoring fluctuations in the sizes of two competing populations. As the population size is constant in our experiments, this large body of theoretical work is of little use to us.
