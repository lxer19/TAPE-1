Title: LOSSY COMPRESSION OF INDIVIDUAL SIGNALS BASED ON STRING MATCHING AND ONE PASS CODEBOOK DESIGN

Abstract: This paper describes an effort to extend the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to a practical universal lossy compression algorithm. It is based on the idea of approximate string matching with a rate-distortion (R D) criterion, and is addressed within the framework of vector quantization (VQ) [4]. A practical one pass algorithm for VQ codebook construction and adaptation for individual signals is developed which assumes no prior knowledge of the source statistics and involves no iteration. We call this technique rate-distortion Lempel-Ziv (RDLZ). As in the case of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, the encoded bit stream consists of codebook (dictionary) updates as well as indices (pointers) to the codebook. The idea of "trading" bits for distortion in modifying the codebook will be introduced. Experimental results show that, for Gaussian sources as well as real images, RDLZ performs comparably, sometimes favorably, to static code-book VQ trained on the corresponding sources or images.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Dictionary coding achieves compression by replacing blocks of source symbols by indices to some dictionary. The dictionary is composed of blocks of source symbols, or phrases, that are expected to occur frequently <ref> [1] </ref>. In adaptive lossless dictionary coding such as the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, the dictionary is built from phrases already seen in the source sequence, and subsequent occurrences of identical phrases are encoded by their indices to the dictionary.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [2] </ref>, Chou et al. introduced an iterative algo-rithm called entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) to design vector quantizers that minimize average distortion subject to an entropy constraint: i) Given C, each x ` i is quantized to ^x ` i = c ` k such that r (c ` i ; c <p> A heuristic estima tion is given by D = KD (C i ; c ` where K is a constant describing the fractional reduc-tion in distortion by splitting the code-vector. Unsurprisingly, the splitting criterion is again (1). Deleting Code-vectors In <ref> [2] </ref>, code-vectors whose cells are unpopulated after an iteration are effectively deleted from the codebook. For our purpose, it may be worthwhile to keep the code-vectors around, since adding them later on will involve considerable overhead.

Reference-contexts: Hence, RDLZ is of the same order in complexity (O (M `) per source vector) as static codebook VQ in terms of source encoding and decoding, except for tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ) <ref> [4] </ref>, which has a lower complexity. However, the average codebook size M for RDLZ can be kept much smaller. stationary memoryless Gaussian signals. - - ECVQ, TSVQ, | RDLZ source distribution at time t 2 , = 0:6, (d) Codebook at time t 2 .
