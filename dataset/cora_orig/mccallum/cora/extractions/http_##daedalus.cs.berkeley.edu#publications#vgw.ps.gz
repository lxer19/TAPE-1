Abstract: The current model for multicast transmission of video over the Internet assumes that a fixed average bandwidth is uniformly present throughout the network. Consequently, sources limit their transmission rates to accommodate the lowest bandwidth links, even though high-bandwidth connectivity might be available to many of the participants. We propose an architecture where a video transmission can be decomposed into multiple sessions with different bandwidth requirements using an application-level gateway. Our video gateway transparently connects pairs of sessions into a single logical conference by manipulating the data and control information of the video streams. In particular, the gateway performs bandwidth adaptation through transcoding and rate-control. We describe an efficient algorithm for transcod-ing Motion-JPEG to H.261 that runs in real-time on standard workstations. By making the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) an integral component of our architecture, the video gateway interoperates with the current Internet video tools in a transparent fashion. We have built a prototype of the video gateway and used it to redistribute multi-megabit JPEG video seminars from the Bay Area Gigabit Network as 128 kb/s H.261 MBone sessions.

Reference-contexts: We intend to implement additional formats including a vector quantization scheme developed for the In-foPad project at U.C. Berkeley <ref> [1] </ref>. For non-transcoded streams, the rate-controller adapts only the packet rate, not the frame rate. This leads to degraded quality because packets are dropped randomly across the bit stream. A more effective model is to adjust the bandwidth by controlling the frame rate.

Reference-contexts: The linear equations are determined by M , which is easily computed with the S <ref> [2] </ref> program shown in on an 8x8 2D matrix would require 8 3 multiplies, which is higher in complexity than a brute force approach using forward and reverse DCTs. Fortunately, many of the values in M are zero and by using approximate arithmetic the computation runs very fast.

Reference-contexts: Distribution Monitoring. The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback to the session on the quality of the data distribution. This information is critical in diagnosing fail ures and monitoring performance, and can be used by applications to dynamically adapt to network congestion <ref> [3] </ref>. Monitoring statistics are disseminated from active sources via RTCP sender reports (SR) and from receivers back to the entire session via receiver reports (RR). The SR statistics include, among other things, the sender's cumulative packet count and sender's cumulative byte count.

Reference-contexts: APPENDIX This appendix describes an efficient algorithm for (approximately) subsampling a signal by operating directly on the DCT coefficients of the transformed signal. We use a matrix decomposition as in <ref> [8] </ref>. Instead of judicially factoring the matrices to reduce the number of multiply operations, we use approximate multipliers in order to reduce them to fixed point shifts and adds.

However, a number of issues need to be resolved before the full potential of these new applications can be realized. <p> At low bit rates, this interval can be substantial. Intra-H.261. A solution to this problem is to avoid inter-mode blocks altogether and instead code every block in intra-mode. This approach, called Intra-H.261 <ref> [9] </ref>, relies on conditional replenishment instead of motion compensation to reduce the bit rate. In conditional replenishment, the video image is partitioned into small blocks and only the blocks format. <p> The JPEG decoder performs table-driven Huffman decoding of the DCT transform coefficients in parallel with conditional replenishment. We optimize the case of an unreplenished block by Huffman decoding the first six DCT coefficients and comparing them to what has already been transmitted, as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. If they are similar enough, we skip the current block by parsing the rest of the coefficients in the block without any additional processing. Hence, in the case where there is little motion in the scene, the system runs at the Huffman decoding speed (which just uses table lookups). <p> The external control interface to the video gateway has not yet been implemented. We plan to realize it with the Conference Bus abstraction described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The Conference Bus provides a high-level coordination protocol for real-time multimedia applications. Simple control scripts can be easily prototyped using a Tcl [11] interface to the Conference Bus. In this way, users can easily configure the gateway for unforeseen applications.

Reference-contexts: For a heterogeneous set of receivers, the source would have to run at a rate that matches the most constrained receiver. This is not satisfactory. Instead, receivers along high bandwidth paths should receive correspondingly higher quality. One approach to this problem is the use of layered coding algorithms <ref> [10, 15, 17] </ref> where hosts along lower bandwidth paths receive fewer layers. While this approach is elegant and efficient, it is not yet deployed nor compatible with the installed base of JPEG hardware and existing video applications.

Reference-contexts: Our approach provides a mechanism for matching the transmission quality to the heterogeneous bandwidth constraints of distinct regions of a single logical multicast session. The gateway does so by intelligently managing incoming and outgoing video streams using transcoding and rate-control. By making the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [14] </ref> an integral component of our architecture, the video gateway interoperates seamlessly with the current Internet video tools. <p> In this section, we give a brief overview of RTP, discuss the ramifications of transcoding an RTP data stream, and propose an architecture that can perform this transcoding in a protocol-consistent fashion. 3.1 Real-time Transport Protocol The Real-time Transport Protocol <ref> [14] </ref> is an application-level protocol that is designed to satisfy the needs of multi-party multimedia applications. In the IP protocol stack, RTP lies (a) (b) just above UDP. The protocol consists of two parts: the data transfer protocol RTP and the control protocol RTCP.
