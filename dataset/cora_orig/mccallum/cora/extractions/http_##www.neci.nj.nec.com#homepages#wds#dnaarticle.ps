Abstract: We show how DNA molecules and standard lab techniques may be used to create a nondeterministic Turing machine. This is the first scheme that shows how to make a universal computer with DNA. We claim that both our scheme and previous ones will work, but they probably cannot be scaled up to be of practical computational importance. In vivo, many of the limitations on our and previous computers are much less severe or do not apply. Hence, lifeforms ought, at least in principle, to be capable of large Turing universal computations. The second part of our paper is a loose collection of biological phenomena that look computational and mathematical models of computation that look biological. We observe that cells face some daunting computational problems, e.g. gene regulation, assembly of complex structures, and antibody synthesis. We then make simplified mathematical models of certain biochemical processes and investigate the computational power of these models. The view of "biology as a computer programming problem" that we espouse, may be useful for biologists. Thus our particular Turing machine construction bears a remarkable resemblance to recently discovered "RNA editing" processes. In fact it may be that the RNA editing machines in T.Brucei and other lifeforms are clonable, extractible and runnable in vitro, in which case one might get a far better performing Turing machine than all constructions so far, including our own. The fact that RNA editing is a Turing machine may in turn have a lot to do with the origins of life. We also have a computer science explanation for "junk DNA."

Are the true mechanisms of multicellular development actually of this sort? Evidence: It is known that some simple multicellular organisms do develop according to rules which entirely fit inside the cellular automaton framework.

These mysteries were resolved by the exciting discovery <ref> (Benne et al. 1986) </ref> of "RNA editing." According to Maslov 1994, "RNA editing occurs in all trypanoso-matid species so far examined," but T.Brucei is the most studied one. Many of the genes in T.Brucei maxicircles are in a so called "encypted" form.

Reference-contexts: We further speculate that junk DNA may be in large part composed of the corpses of former replicons, which would explain (1) how it got there, (2) the fact that a lot of junk is highly repetitive <ref> (Britten and Kohne 1968) </ref> 38 and (3) our theory is also supported by the fact that closely related species often have vastly differing amounts of DNA (factors of 5-10). Finally, even with replicon killers, higher life forms still face the problem that their genomes may gradually become overwhelmed by junk.

Reference-contexts: ribosomes are general purpose protein constructors which work to order to mRNA blueprints, the micro-tubule vesicle-transportation system of eukaryotic cells may also work to order, according to some sort of "train tickets." It is a commonplace that membranes in cells have many sophisticated kinds of portals, and it is known <ref> (Lombardi, Soldati, Riederer 1993) </ref> that vesicles "dock" with the right lipid membranes with the aid of recognition molecules called "Rab proteins." Be that as it may, the entire problem of multicellular development is easy to explain, assuming we live in a certain oversimplified mathematical model universe a "cellular automaton." See x3.6.3.

Reference-contexts: B comes from an mRNA in which a single C!A, conversion was performed, but this is known (Greeve et al. 1991) to occur via an entirely different sort of mechanism from the one in T.Brucei; meanwhile the RNA editing in yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) seems to be more similar to T.Brucei <ref> (Mueller et al. 1993) </ref>. eukaryotes." In most genes known so far in most eukary-otes, mammals included, the only RNA editing which goes on (but it happens extensively!) is the excision of introns (substrings) by "spliceosomes." What makes T.Brucei and its kinetoplastid kin different is that more than simply splicing out introns

Reference-contexts: The non-anchored strands are washed away.)
