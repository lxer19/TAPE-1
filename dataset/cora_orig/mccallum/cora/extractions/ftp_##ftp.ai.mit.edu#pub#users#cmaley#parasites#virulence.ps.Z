Reference-contexts: any particular host-parasite association will ultimately depend on the way the virulence and the projection of transmission stages of the parasite are linked together: depending on the specifics of this linkage, the coevolutionary course can be toward essentially zero virulence, or to very high virulence, or to some intermediate grade. <ref> [ Anderson and May, 1982 ] </ref> In other words, there are significant pressures on parasites that might select for varying levels of virulence, not just for avirulence or commensalism. This can be seen formally in a simple equation for the reproductive rate given by May and Anderson (1990).

Reference-contexts: For example, Herre (1993) operationalizes virulence as a reduction in lifetime reproductive success of the host, rather than disease induced death rate as per Ewald (1983) and May and Anderson (1990). has been focused on the theory behind the construc-tion of configuration models <ref> [ Maley and Caswell, 1993, Baveco and Lingeman, 1992 ] </ref> . configuration models open up the possibility of explicitly representing the interactions between individuals.

Reference-contexts: Rich, R.C. Berwick, E.S. Johnson, and M.S. Golden for their helpful comments and support. The Theory I am using the term parasite in the broadest possible understanding. A parasite is any organism that gains its nutrients from other living organisms and usually has a deleterious effect on those organisms <ref> [ Begon et al., 1990 ] </ref> . It was long thought that a parasite's relationship to its host would evolve to become less deleterious, or virulent, over time. This was based on an essentially group selectionist, or "good of the species" argument. <p> In the biological world, a parasite's mode of transmission is not fixed, and may evolve along with virulence. It is also clear that there are many complex interactions between real parasites and the host's immune system, as well as between different parasite species, not to mention other factors <ref> [ Begon et al., 1990 ] </ref> . These effects are likely to be dramatic compared to the effect of dispersal distance on virulence.

Reference-contexts: The model keeps track of the configuration of all of the individuals in the population. Since the distribution model is also based on the individuals in the population, this new form of model may be called a configuration model <ref> [ Caswell and John, 1992 ] </ref> . Although configuration models are relatively new to ecological modeling [ Huston et al., 1988 ] , they have been essential to artificial life. Emergent dynamics are often observed through the local interaction of individuals.

Reference-contexts: These models lump individuals together into homogenous groups that can be represented by a single number, the number of individuals in that group. They may break a population down into a number groups depending on any number of characteristics, like age, sex, weight, etc. <ref> [ Caswell, 1989 ] </ref> . However, in each subgroup, the individuals within the groups are still treated as identical. In this way, these models may describe the distribution of individuals in the population. Caswell and John (1992) label these distribution models.

Reference-contexts: On occasion this has produced evidence that contradicts or extends the analysis of distribution models <ref> [ Boerlijst and Hogeweg, 1992, Collins and Jefferson, 1992 ] </ref> . In the case of a host-parasitoid interaction, a configuration model can explicitly model the reproduction and transmission of parasites. This allows an intuitive and direct analogy between the dynamics of the model and the dynamics of the biological system.

Reference-contexts: Introduction There is a growing interest in the application of evolutionary theory to disease control and treatment <ref> [ Ewald, 1983, Williams and Nesse, 1991 ] </ref> . At the same time, computer modeling is opening up new areas of evolutionary theory by allowing us to ask questions that were previously extremely difficult to test in the lab [ Koza, 1994, Lindgren and Nordahl, 1994, for example ] . <p> In no single instance do we have enough information to determine the likely evolutionary tra jectory dictated by maximizing R 0 in [equation 1]. The Observations In fact, parasite reproduction is generally correlated with disease severity <ref> [ Ewald, 1983 ] </ref> . As Ewald puts it, the question then becomes, "What environmental conditions select for different levels of parasite reproduction and, hence, for different levels of severity?" Two examples help to illustrate the point. <p> and 1960's, the milder agent of cholera, the El Tor type of Vibrio cholerae, displaced the more dangerous form, clas sical V. cholerae. [ Ewald, 1993 ] Unfortunately, the evidence for the evolution of virulence in relation to the parasite's mode of dispersal remains largely observational, and thus only correlational <ref> [ Ewald, 1983 ] </ref> . Ewald (1983) goes on to predict that parasites that are highly mobile should cause severe diseases. <p> This removes the entire dynamic of coevolution. It also removes the possibility for sexual reproduction in hosts. Hamilton, Axelrod, and Tanese (1990) argue that sexual reproduction may have evolved as an adaptive response to parasitism. We lack data on the relationship between parasite reproduction and virulence in general <ref> [ May and An-derson, 1990, Ewald, 1983 ] </ref> , or and ff in equation 1. Therefore I have let the relationship be linear as a first approximation. Specifically, a parasite will produce d energyparasite reproduction threshold parasite cost of reproduction e number of offspring in one time step.

Reference-contexts: Baveco and Lingeman were not trying to model the evolution of virulence. In fact, they were not trying to model evolution at all. They took a classical distribution model <ref> [ Nicholson and Bailey, 1935 ] </ref> of an ecological interaction between hosts and parasites and examined the dynamics of the system when all the individuals were explicitly represented. However, a similar model might be constructed where the parasites might have a "gene" for virulence.
