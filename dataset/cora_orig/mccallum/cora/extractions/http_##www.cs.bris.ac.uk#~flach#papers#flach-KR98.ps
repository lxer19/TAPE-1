Title: Comparing Consequence Relations

For all other premisses they agree on the consequences. It follows that the set of CNM

Abstract: The technical problem addressed in this paper is, given two rule systems for consequence relations X and Y, how to construct Yapproximations of a given X-relation. While an upper Y-approximation can be easily constructed if all Y-rules are Horn, the construction of lower Y-approximations is less straightforward. We address the problem by defining the notion of co-closure under co-Horn rules, that can be used to remedy violation of certain rules by removing arguments. In particular, we show how the co-closure under Monotonicity can be used to construct the monotonic restriction of a preferential relation. Unlike the more usual closure under the rules of M , this co-closure operator supports the intuition that preferential reasoning is more liberal than monotonic reasoning. The approach is embedded in a general framework for comparing rule systems for consequence relations. A salient feature of this framework is that it is also possible to compare rule systems that are not related by metalevel Nonmonotonic reasoning is the process of tentatively inferring from given information rather more than is deductively implied (Makinson, 1994). Nonmonotonic reasoning can thus be said to be more liberal than monotonic reasoning. Correspondingly, the set of arguments accepted by a nonmonotonic reasoning agent (also called a consequence relation, and defined as a subset of LL, where L is the language) can be divided into a deductive or monotonic part and a nonmonotonic part. Let us call the function which maps an arbitrary consequence relation to its monotonic core the monotonic restriction. considered before (Stachniak, 1993), it does not seem to occupy a central place in the theory of nonmonotonic consequence relations, and operators to construct the monotonic core of a given relation have not been defined before. 1 Kraus et al. (1990) define a monotonic closure operator, which however maps a consequence relation to a monotonic superset (and may therefore be called the monotonic extension). The operator seems to be inspired by the Horn form of the rules they consider. However, as we show in this paper even with Horn rules it is possible to apply them in the reverse direction to remove arguments from the consequence relation. Another aspect we clarify in this paper is the role of metalevel entailment between rule systems. For instance, we have that all the rules of P are rules of M , hence all monotonic consequence relations are preferential. In our view this is a special case of a more general phenomenon, namely that P-semantics encodes more information than M-semantics, because it has to distinguish more consequence relations. However, the presence of metalevel entailment does not, by itself, indicate whether this extra information is used to establish a more liberal or rather a less liberal form of reasoning. Moreover, metalevel entailment is not even a necessary condition for one rule system to be more liberal than another. This will be demonstrated by defining a variant of P that is incomparable to it wrt. metalevel entailment (each system includes a rule that is not a rule of the other system), yet clearly and unambiguously axiomatises a less liberal form of reasoning than P . In fact, failure to relate these rule systems by an existing comparison criterion was the original motivation for this paper. entailment.
