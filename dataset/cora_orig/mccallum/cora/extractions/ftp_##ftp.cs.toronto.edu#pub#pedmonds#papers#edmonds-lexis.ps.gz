Abstract: In this paper, we examine how lexical knowledge has been modelled and used in generation systems of the past, and, looking to the future, what will be required of the lexicon to build versatile and expressive generators. Three central issues discussed are the following: the relationship between words and text structure, the connection between concepts and words, and the influence of context on word use and combination. We find that for a generator to be expressive, it must have knowledge of phrasal items, especially of collocations. We also find that the many available options for expressing a concept can be distinguished from another by pragmatic factors such as connotation, implicature, and style. Most importantly, this phrasal and pragmatic knowledge should be explicit and functional; it must prescribe how words are used, chosen, and combined.

Reference-contexts: Near-synonyms may differ in many ways, sometimes several at once, including differences in denotation (e.g., lie vs. fib), emphasis (e.g., foe vs. enemy), implicature (e.g., mislay vs. lose), and formality (e.g., drunk vs. pissed), among others <ref> (DiMarco, Hirst and Stede, 1993) </ref>. Hirst proposes that differences be represented as objects that can be reasoned about at both the level of concept and the level of word.

Reference-contexts: The second application is made outside the framework of the MTM. Here, lexical functions serve as the basis of a set of lexical resources for a complex lexical choice process in a text generator. 4.3.1 An Application Within the MTM GOSSiP <ref> (Iordanskaja, Kittredge and Polguere, 1991) </ref> is a sentence-generation system that implements the MTM. The strength of the system is that it can generate a large variety of different lexicalizations from a single input by paraphrasing the utterance at its various levels of representation.

Reference-contexts: So systemic-functional generators would not seem to be a good choice for such applications. However, this has not stopped the Pangloss machine translation project from pursuing an effort to merge the upper parts of Penman's knowledge base with other resources to form a language-independent ontology <ref> (Knight and Luk, 1994) </ref>. 2.2.3 Phrasal Lexicons In a sense, Penman represents the lexicon as part of the grammar. A different perspective would be to view the grammar as part of the lexicon, a view that starts by considering the phrasal patterns in language.

Reference-contexts: He estimates that "we probably know as many or more phrases than we know single words." This idea has been used in several implemented generators. Kukich's Ana <ref> (Kukich, 1988) </ref> uses the simplest notion of phrase by representing only frozen phrases in the lexicon. A `macro-level' grammar has production rules that combine phrases to make sentences and paragraphs. However, the system and methodology are inadequate because the phrases are taken from a very restricted domain.

Reference-contexts: The interface between these two stages has been a very contentious issue in text generation circles. Wanner's solution is to model the interface as a complex lexical choice process that can transform a text plan, built out of Mann and Thompson's RST relations <ref> (Mann and Thompson, 1987) </ref>, into a grammatical structure that is given to a sentence generator. 15 The lexical choice process makes use of a situation-specific, multi-layered model of lexical resources that is grounded in lexical functions, and ultimately words.

Reference-contexts: The qualia structure is a novel formalism that is a powerful means of representing certain kinds collocational behaviour. In generation, we have seen this to be important for both using language creatively <ref> (McDonald and Busa, 1994) </ref>, and for choosing appropriate combinations of words (Viegas and Bouillon, 1994). One thing that the formalism is lacking is a lexical choice procedure.

Reference-contexts: So, only the most basic of lexical knowledge is used by the system: features relevant to morphology and syntax are stored in the lexicon. One of the first complete text generation systems was McKeown's TEXT <ref> (McKeown, 1985) </ref>. Lexical knowledge in TEXT is stored in several places because of the architecture of the system.

Reference-contexts: In sections 3 and 4 I will examine two avenues of recent lexical research that have sophisticated representations, both descriptive and functional, of how words combine. In section 3 we look at Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon <ref> (Pustejovsky, 1991) </ref>, and in section 4, Mel'cuk's Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (Mel'cuk and Polguere, 1987). 2 Lexical Knowledge in Generation Systems Lexical knowledge can take many forms in natural language generation systems.

Reference-contexts: This meant that a text generator would have to at least allow for interaction between lexical and structural decisions. Researchers also realized that the problem of selecting words was much more important than was previously thought <ref> (Pustejovsky and Nirenburg, 1987) </ref>; because, as application domains grew more complex, their lexicons also grew, and consequently concepts in the input could be realized by many possible words. This would inevitably require more complex mappings between concepts and words.
