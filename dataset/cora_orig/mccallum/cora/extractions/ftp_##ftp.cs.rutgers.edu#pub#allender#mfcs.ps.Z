Abstract: In [AS], we defined a notion of measure on the complexity class P (in the spirit of the work of Lutz [L92] that provides a notion of measure on complexity classes at least as large as E, and the work of Mayordomo [M] that provides a measure on PSPACE). In this paper, we show that several other ways of defining measure in terms of covers and martingales yield precisely the same notion as in [AS]. (Similar "robustness" results have been obtained previously for the notions of measure defined by [L92] and [M], but for reasons that will become apparent below different proofs are required in our setting.) To our surprise, and in contrast to the measures of Lutz [L92] and Mayordomo [M], one obtains strictly more measurable sets if one considers "nonconservative" martingales that succeed merely in the lim sup rather than having a limit of infinity. For example, it is shown in [AS] that the class of sparse sets does not have measure zero in P, whereas here we show that using the "nonconservative" measure, the class of sparse sets (and in fact the class of sets with density * &lt; 1=2) does have measure zero. We also show that our "nonconservative" measure on PSPACE is incomparable with that of [M]. fl A paper announcing these results appears in the proceedings of the 1995 International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS '95). y Research supported by NSF grant CCR-9204874.

In this paper, we show that the class of measure zero sets one obtains using the definition of <ref> [AS] </ref> is the same as that one obtains by formulating the definition in terms of conservative martingales (both in the lim sup sense and in the limit sense) and it is also equivalent to being covered in the limit sense by a martingale that is not assumed to be conservative. <p> Furthermore, some of the classes one is able to cover in this sense are fairly interesting and natural. For instance, using the definition presented in <ref> [AS] </ref>, we showed that the class of sparse sets does not have measure zero in P. However, using the more generous notion of measure (non-conservative martingales) we show here that the class of all sets that are not exponentially dense has measure zero in P. Our previous paper [AS] provided a <p> presented in <ref> [AS] </ref>, we showed that the class of sparse sets does not have measure zero in P. However, using the more generous notion of measure (non-conservative martingales) we show here that the class of all sets that are not exponentially dense has measure zero in P. Our previous paper [AS] provided a notion of measure not only for P (and other time-bounded classes), but also for PSPACE (and other space-bounded classes).

The measure on PSPACE presented in [AS] provides strictly fewer measurable sets than the measure of [M]. However, if one defines a measure on PSPACE using the nonconservative, lim sup notion, we show here that one obtains a notion that is incomparable with that of [M]. <p> The reason this strikes us as surprising is that one of the technical difficulties that had to be overcome in defining the measure in <ref> [AS] </ref> was that an appropriate representation for numerical outputs had to be found that could be represented in a small number of bits, but still would allow efficient arithmetic operations.

In order that the notion of measure be a "reasonable" notion of big and small, certain axioms have to be satisfied, and this is most easily done in the delicate formulation of [AS], which involves output as differences of formal sums of powers of two, and martingales whose values are approximated rather than computed exactly. In nearly all cases, the arguments here also apply to the measures of [L92] and [M]. <p> In nearly all cases, the arguments here also apply to the measures of [L92] and [M]. Thus this paper gives a unified treatment of the robustness theorems. 2 Definitions First we review the measure defined in <ref> [AS] </ref>. <p> We write w v z to denote that w is a prefix of z. Now we present a key notion that is essential to defining the measure in <ref> [AS] </ref>. <p> Thus, without loss of generality, we can assume G ^ d;jwj;r G ^ d;jwj;s for r s: While the observation of Lemma 1 is immediate, it is important for the constructions in this paper, as well as for Theorem 4 in <ref> [AS] </ref>. ([AS] was somewhat unclear on this point.) The reader should not confuse monotonicity in r (which is always possible and henceforth always assumed) with the niceness property "monotonicity" (i.e., monotonicity in jwj). Next we give an exact computation lemma for martingales and density systems in our setting. <p> If ^ d k;r is a computation for d k ; then, as in <ref> [AS] </ref>, the martin gale d has computation ^ d r (w) = k=0 This construction destroys conservation, so one cannot use it to convert a conservative density system into a conservative martingale. <p> Theorem 4 If a set is covered by a conservative cover, then it is covered by a slothful cover. Proof. We will give the proof for increasingly general cases. First we review an argument in <ref> [AS] </ref> for exactly computed martingales, then give the proof for martingales that are not exactly computed. Density systems are handled similarly. <p> The reader is invited to convert a conservative density system into a martingale of the desired form by tracing the entire Fig. 1. We know of no way to do this other than using all of theorems 4 through 8. 3.3 Space The notion of measure of <ref> [AS] </ref> can be defined for space as well as time. We conclude this section by comparing our conservative measure on PSPACE, denoted (PSPACE) , with the measure of [M], here denoted (PSPACE) : Theorem 10 If a set has a (PSPACE) cover, than it also has a (PSPACE) cover. Proof. <p> From this it can compute log jwj and djwje even before it sees input. The machine will first compute G d;djwje : As the input is read, the machine can cache the bits in positions in G d;djwje ; then compute d (w) from the cached bits alone. In <ref> [AS] </ref> it is shown that SPARSE does not have (PSPACE) measure zero. <p> In the previous section we showed (PSPACE) is strictly weaker than (PSPACE) ; here we show that 0 (PSPACE) is incomparable with (PSPACE) : 4.1 Conservative versus Nonconserva tive measure In <ref> [AS] </ref> it was shown that SPARSE, the set of languages with at most polynomially many words of a given length, does not have an exactly-computable conservative cover. The theorems of the last section show that SPARSE has no conservative cover at all. <p> j j = n 2 log 2 jwj: Finally, let L be a language of density less than *: Then the density of L is less than * on R j for infinitely-many j's, and for such j d climbs to d j =j 2 = j along L: In <ref> [AS] </ref> it is noted that the set of languages with density n k (fixed k) is (P)-null, whereas all of SPARSE is not. Thus [AS] presents a threshold density for (P)-measure. <p> is less than * on R j for infinitely-many j's, and for such j d climbs to d j =j 2 = j along L: In <ref> [AS] </ref> it is noted that the set of languages with density n k (fixed k) is (P)-null, whereas all of SPARSE is not. Thus [AS] presents a threshold density for (P)-measure. Theorem 11 shows that 0 (P)-measure is significantly stronger in this regard. 4.2 Space Now we compare our PSPACE measure to that of [M]. <p> Suppose L is defined for all words of length less than n: First extend according to the path of decreasing d; as in the proof of Theorem 4 of <ref> [AS] </ref>; call this extended language L 0 : Thus d 0 is bounded along L 0 : For all large n; let x be the lexicographically largest string of length n such that pos (x) =2 G pos (1 n ) : Note that (by transitivity) for all m 2 (pos <p> Also, the possible final parity fix leaves d (L [1::m]) = d (L 0 [1::m]) for all other m pos (1 n ); so d obeys twice the bound on L that it obeys on L 0 : We now present a set measurable in the sense of <ref> [AS] </ref> but not in the sense of [M]. Partition fl as follows. Write n as two phases 0 n ; where i n consists of words of length n beginning with i (so 0 n consists of the words in positions 2 n through 2 n + 2 n1 ). <p> We draw two important corollaries: * The usual way that sublinear-time machines compute functions is to output the i th bit as a function of i: The most natural way is to output the value in binary. In <ref> [AS] </ref> functions output "differences of formal sums of powers of two." Now, since two-sided quasipolyon-mial precision suffices, we see that all three conventions are equivalent. * If a set A has a cover d with approximation ^ d; such that jd ^ d r j 1 r 2 and ^ d <p> Still, a large and growing body of results have shown that resource-bounded measure is a useful tool providing surprising connections to other questions in computer science [RSC]. The extension of this notion to small classes such as P is a much newer notion, and although the results of <ref> [AS] </ref> have shown that interesting results can be obtained using one definition of a measure on P, we should not be surprised if this notion evolves as further experience is gained. This paper represents the next step of such an evolution. <p> This paper represents the next step of such an evolution. Although we were able to show here that the measure of <ref> [AS] </ref> is robust under many changes to the details of the definition, we have learned the surprising fact that one can obtain strictly more measurable sets by considering betting strategies that throw away information periodically.

In the setting of Lutz et al, the covers have at least linear time. It has been shown <ref> [JLM] </ref> that one can take an exactly-computed but not-necessarily-conservative cover d (w); check the linearly many prefixes z v w where d may fail to be conservative, and fix each one, that is, output d (w) + zvw d (z) 2 6 as a conservative cover.
