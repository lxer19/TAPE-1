Abstract: An algorithm for surface reconstruction from a polyhedron with arbitrary topology consisting of triangular faces is presented. The first variant of the algorithm constructs a curve network consisting of cubic Bezier curves meeting with tangent plane continuity at the vertices. This curve network is extended to a smooth surface by replacing each of the networks facets with a split patch consisting of three triangular Bezier patches. The remaining degrees of freedom of the curve network and the split patches are determined by minimizing a quadratic functional. This optimization process works either for the curve network and the split patches separately or in one simultaneous step. The second variant of our algorithm is based on the construction of an optimized curve network with higher continuity. Examples demonstrate the quality of the different methods.

Reference-contexts: a unique circular segment s; we set fl fl fl = arc (s) (see Figure 2). 5 DeBoor-Hollig-Sabin: This method requires additional information about the curvature at V 0 and V 1 ; a detailed discussion of the construction of this type of curve is given by DeRose and Mann <ref> [2] </ref>; we use the norm of the tangents of the DeBoor-Hollig-Sabin-curve to set the length of ~ t. The curves of the network are defined as cubic Bezier curves interpolating the corresponding vertex-positions and the tangents with parameteric directions as described above.

Reference-contexts: This can be done by using a quadratic functional to approximate the exact, but highly non-linear functional that, e.g., describes the curvature or the variation of curvature of a curve or surface. Greiner <ref> [4] </ref> shows how these approximative functionals can be chosen in order to achieve a result close to that of the exact functionals. Moreover, we must guarantee that our curve network or surface depends linearly on the free parameters which we want to optimize. <p> The functional 2 is known as Minimum Variation of Curvature (MVC) functional. This functional has proved to yield surfaces with very good shape (see <ref> [4, 10] </ref>). Greiner [4] gives good quadratic approximations to these functionals. The quadratic approximation to 1 is based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator for surfaces (see Section 3.1). The quadratic approximation to 2 involves higher order derivatives and is referred to as simplified MVC functional. <p> The functional 2 is known as Minimum Variation of Curvature (MVC) functional.

Reference-contexts: Moreton and Sequin use exact formulas to describe the non-linear constraints necessary to represent a G 2 curve network (curves with a common end point have the same tangent plane and agree with the same second fundamental form at this point; see <ref> [5] </ref>) and a smooth surface. Optimization based on a non-quadratic objective functional is used to generate an optimized curve network and a smooth surface. As a result of the exact description of the constraints and the non-quadratic objective functional, only iterative methods can be used to determine the optimal parameters. <p> A widely used quadratic functional is (C) = fl fl 2 We refer to this functional as a simple functional. The second functional we use is based on the Laplace Beltrami operator (see <ref> [5] </ref>) C 0 (C) = hC 0 0 i hC 0 0 iC 0 0 jC 0 This operator describes the second derivative of the curve C with respect to the arc-length of the reference curve C 0 . <p> fairing: 1 (F ) = ( 1 ) 2 + ( 2 ) 2 d!; ; 2 (F ) = @ 1 2 @ ^ e 2 d!; (1) where i denote the principle curvatures and ^ e i the corresponding directions of principle curvature of the surface F (see <ref> [5] </ref>). The functional 2 is known as Minimum Variation of Curvature (MVC) functional. This functional has proved to yield surfaces with very good shape (see [4, 10]). Greiner [4] gives good quadratic approximations to these functionals.

Reference-contexts: In the case of functional MNN such extensions to higher order curve networks already exist (see <ref> [6, 15] </ref>). Furthermore, Pottmann [15] introduces cross-boundary derivatives into the optimization of the curve network which leads to a more surface-like network description. The basic idea of the representation of a G 2 curve network is very much the same as for the G 1 curve network.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively one can try to generate a G 1 curve network with admissible data, i.e. a curve network that guarantees a solution consisting of one non-degenerate Bezier patch per 3 facet. Loop <ref> [7] </ref> describes a method doing this. Yet another possibility is to use networks with higher continuity. A G 2 network can always be extended to a smooth surface with only one Bezier patch per facet.

Reference-contexts: The underlaying representation of the curve network yields a relatively large number of unknowns for the optimization. Moreover, this representation can not be extended to curve networks with higher continuity. These seem to be the major disadvantages of this method. Moreton and Sequin <ref> [10] </ref> present a method using functional optimization to generate fair surfaces. The results of their scheme is, in general, very appealing. <p> The functional 2 is known as Minimum Variation of Curvature (MVC) functional. This functional has proved to yield surfaces with very good shape (see <ref> [4, 10] </ref>). Greiner [4] gives good quadratic approximations to these functionals.

The quadratic approximation to 2 involves higher order derivatives and is referred to as simplified MVC functional.

Reference-contexts: One the other hand, optimizing methods try to overcome the short comings of the traditional heuristic methods utilizing the idea of variational design. Nielson [12] proposes a method applying the basic ideas of the minimum norm networks known from functional scattered data interpolation (see <ref> [11] </ref> and Section 2.2) to the general situation. Nielson uses a quadratic functional to optimize a G 1 curve network. This reduces the optimization process to solving a linear system (see Section 2.1).

Reference-contexts: If the underlying curve network is G 1 , the problem of fitting one non-degenerate Bezier patch to each facet of the curve network has, in general, no solution (see Peters <ref> [14] </ref>). One way to overcome this is to fill each facet with several Bezier patches, e.g. by using the split scheme described by Shirman and Sequin [16].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The reconstruction of a surface from a set of (a priori unorganized) points as well as the design of surfaces with arbitrary shape (or topology) are of major concern for numerous applications in CAD/CAM-based technologies. Veltkamp <ref> [17] </ref> gives an overview on existing methods concerning the first topic. In this paper we will address the following surface reconstruction problem which is closely related to both topics: Given: A non-degenerate polyhedron in 3-space with triangular faces.
