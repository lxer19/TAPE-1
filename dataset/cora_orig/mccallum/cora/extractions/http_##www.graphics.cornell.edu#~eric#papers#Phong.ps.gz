Abstract: The first section presents the definition of the bidirectional reflection distribution function (brdf) of a surface and its physical properties. * The third section goes into details about a specific reflectance model, the modified Phong brdf, with its definition, its properties and its use. We show how this model can be correctly integrated in importance sampling schemes for physically based Monte Carlo rendering algorithms.

Any implementation of a global illumination algorithm uses a reflectance model. <p> While the model does not have a physical basis and cannot be used as a brdf as it is, a physically plausible brdf which is very similar to the shading model is commonly used in rendering algorithms <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> It is sampled uniformly over the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and the following actions are taken accordingly: * 0 ~ &lt; d : take a diffuse sample and compute its contribution, * d ~ &lt; d + s : take a specular sample and compute its contribution, * d + s ~ 1: the contribution is 0. <p> Sampling directional distributions In the previous paragraphs two types of pdfs for directions were used. The space of directions in 3D-space is two-dimensional, so these pdfs can be sampled by selecting 2 uniform stochastic variables ~ 1 and ~ 2 over the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and transforming them appropriately: * For pdf (fi) = 1 cos the direction fi can be specified in terms of (; ), where is the polar angle with the surface normal and is the azimuthal angle: (; ) = ( acos p In terms of direction vector coordinates (x;

Reference-contexts: This type of importance sampling is commonly used in stochastic ray tracing where new directions have to be sampled recursively at each intersection point <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] </ref>. * Some algorithms require that brdf (times the cosine factor) can be integrated easily over the hemisphere to obtain the total hemispherical reflectivity . Although the brdf can always be integrated numerically in principle, more efficient ways are much preferred. <p> It is more effective to sample the diffuse part and the specular part of the brdf separately. Even this approach is difficult to implement correctly <ref> [7] </ref>. We propose a mathematically correct procedure in Section 3.3.2. * The brdf times the cosine factor cannot be integrated analytically over the hemisphere because of the specular part. Firstly, the combination of the cosff and cos factors already precludes an exact analytical formula.
