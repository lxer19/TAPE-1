Abstract: When an airbag deploys on a rear-facing infant seat, it can injure or kill the infant. When an airbag deploys on an empty seat, the airbag and the money to replace it are wasted. We have shown that video images can be used to determine whether or not to deploy the passengerside airbag in a crash. Images of the passenger seat, taken from a video camera mounted inside the vehicle, can be used to classify the seat as either empty, containing a rear-facing infant seat, or occupied. Our first experiment used a single, monochrome video camera. The system was automatically trained on a series of test images. Using a principle components (eigenimages) nearest neighbor classifier, it achieved a correct classification rate of 99.5% on a test of 910 images. Our second experiment used a pair of monochrome video cameras to compute stereo disparity (a function of 3D range) instead of intensity images. Using a similar algorithm, the second approach achieved a correct classification rate of 95.1% on a test of 890 images. The stereo technique has the advantage of being less sensitive to illumination, and would likely work best in a real system.

Reference-contexts: These ideas of principle components and nearest neighbor classification can be found in standard textbooks such as Fukunagas <ref> [1] </ref>. Empty Seat Projections -0.4 0 0.4 Infant Seat Projections -0.4 0 0.4 show projections from seat in forward, middle, and back positions. Points near the origin occurred in darker conditions, while points farthest away occurred around noon. Similar structure holds for infant seat projections.

Reference-contexts: The range is inversely proportional to disparity. In fact, we did not compute range at all, using just the raw disparities for classification. For each point in the left image, we find a match in the right image using a stereo correlation method described by Matthies in <ref> [2] </ref>. This method extracts a small window around each point in the left image and finds the best match in the right image using correlation (SSD) search along the epipolar line. For our reduced resolution stereo images of size 120x128, we used windows of size 5x7.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The increased safety afforded by automobile airbags (2505 lives saved to date) has produced government regulations and consumer demand that will have half of all vehicles on the road in 2000 equipped with driver and passengerside airbags <ref> [3] </ref>. All cars made after August 31, 1997 must have dual airbags [4]. The increased number of airbags will also magnify their problems: airbags wastefully deploying on empty passenger seats and dangerously deploying on rear-facing infant seats (RFIS). <p> The average cost of replacing an airbag is $700, which has in part fueled more airbag thefts [4]. A more serious unwanted airbag deployment occurs on RFISs. Airbags deploy at speeds up to 200 mph. This force is blamed for 12 infant deaths since 1990 <ref> [3] </ref>. This paper describes a research effort at Sandia National Laboratories to develop a video sensor mounted inside a vehicle to solve these problems. This occupant detection system reliably classifies a vehicles passenger seat as either empty, occupied by a RFIS, or occupied by a regular person.

Fourth IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, October 1998, Princeton, New Jersey, USA 2 correctly classified about 99% of test images, while the range-based algorithm correctly classified about 95% of a more challenging test set. Alternative technologies for occupant sensing <ref> [5] </ref> include a system from Mercedes Benz that senses the presence of a RFIS with a special resonating device built in. They also use a weight sensor to prevent the airbag from deploying if the passenger seat is empty.
