Abstract: We describe a low-cost, functional tester for the MacII that allows students to test and debug digital systems interactively. This tester provides a large number of programmable I/O signals and can be used to test chips, boards and subsystems. Test programs are easily written using a simple, intuitive interface and we expect a variety of interactive graphical testing and debugging environments to be built for the tester. We plan to make this tester generally available in kit form.
