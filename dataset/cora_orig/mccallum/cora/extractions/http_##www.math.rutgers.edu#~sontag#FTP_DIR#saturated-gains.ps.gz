Abstract: This paper deals with (global) finite-gain input/output stabilization of linear systems with saturated controls. For neutrally stable systems, it is shown that the linear feedback law suggested by the passivity approach indeed provides stability, with respect to every L p -norm. Explicit bounds on closed-loop gains are obtained, and they are related to the norms for the respective systems without saturation. These results do not extend to the class of systems for which the state matrix has eigenvalues on the imaginary axis with nonsimple (size &gt; 1) Jordan blocks, contradicting what may be expected from the fact that such systems are globally asymptotically stabilizable in the state-space sense; this is shown in particular for the double integrator.

Reference-contexts: system (36) is defined to be the symmetric matrix that satisfies ~ AQ + Q ~ A T + BB T = 0 : (41) We know that the Hankel norm for (36) is equal to kW k hankel = 1 2 where max () denotes the largest eigenvalue, cf. <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> By our as-sumption we know that the system _x = Ax + Bu (52) is controllable. Any point x 0 2 IR n can be reached from 0 by trajectories of (52) at time 1. Moreover we can choose a u x 0 on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that steers 0 to x 0 and satisfies ku x 0 k L 1 [0;1] Ckx 0 k, where C &gt; 0 is a constant depending on A; B (cf. e.g. [13]). <p> Moreover kvk L 1 [0;1] can be made small if kx 0 k is small. So if we let u = v (t) f (x (t)) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where x is the solution of (52), then u steers 0 to x 0 for (46) at time 1. Let U be an open neighborhood of 0. <p> If x is the solution of (45) starting at x 0 , and if we let u (t) = u x 0 (t) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and u (t) = 0 on (1; 1), then the solution x u of (46) satisfies x u (t) = x (t 1) on [1; 1).

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we use simply the term L p -stability to mean this stronger finite gain condition. The reader is referred to the companion paper <ref> [2] </ref> for complementary results to those in this paper, dealing with Lipschitz continuity ("incremental gain stability") and continuity of the operators in question. The two papers are technically independent. Organization of Paper Section 2 provides definitions and statements of the main results, as well as some related comments.

(For the use of the same formulas for just state-space stabilization, but applying to linear systems with saturations, see [5] and [9]; see also the discussion on the "Jurdevic-Quinn" method in <ref> [13] </ref>.) 2 In this paper, we essentially generalize the passivity technique to systems with saturations. We first establish finite gain stability in the various p-norms, using linear state feedback stabilizers. Then we show how outputs can be incorporated into the framework. <p> our purposes, and it simplifies matters, we assume that the function f : IR n fi IR m ! IR n is globally Lipschitz with respect to (x; u). (Most results will still be valid under Caratheodory-type assumptions.) Terminology for systems will be as in any standard reference, such as <ref> [13] </ref>. Notice that under the above Lipschitz condition, the solution x of () corresponding to any input u 2 L p ([0; 1); IR m ) for 1 p 1 is well defined for all t 2 [0; 1), as an absolutely continuous function. <p> skew-symmetric, the matrix ~ A := A 2 B 2 B T 2 is Hurwitz. (Just observe that the Lyapunov equation ~ A T I nr + I nr ~ A = 2B 2 B T 2 holds, and the pair ( ~ A; B 2 ) is controllable; see <ref> [13] </ref>, Exercise 4.6.7.) Therefore, the theorem is a consequence of the following lemma. This is where the main parts of our argument lie. 10 Lemma 3 Let ; be as in Theorem 2. Let A be a skew-symmetric matrix. Assume that ~ A := A BB T is Hurwitz. <p> Moreover we can choose a u x 0 on [0; 1] that steers 0 to x 0 and satisfies ku x 0 k L 1 [0;1] Ckx 0 k, where C &gt; 0 is a constant depending on A; B (cf. e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>). By a measurable selection it is also true that there is a measurable control v that steers 0 to x 0 for the system _x = Ax + B (v), provided that x 0 is small enough. <p> EF " ) has an eigenvalue with positive real part, where E = diag ( 0 1 (0); : : : ; 0 m (0)). (This follows as in [12], or by noticing that one may first use a small F to make the system reachable from one input -cf. <ref> [13] </ref>, Remark 4.1.13- and then using Ackermann's formula for pole-shifting.) By the Small-Gain Theorem, the system _x = Ax + B (f (x) + F " x + u) ; (53) obtained by feeding back F " x, is again L p -stable. <p> Now from (i) we know that _x = Ax+B (f (x)+F " x) is locally asymptotically stable. But this is impossible since the linearized system is unstable (see e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>, Corollary 4.8.8). This contradiction shows that A + BF is Hurwitz. 6.2 Dissipation Inequality and Input to State Stability Next we give a slightly different proof of Theorem 2, which results in a weaker statement (we now allow " to depend on p) but which is somewhat simpler.
