Abstract: The paper presents the general theory of designing multidimensional Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF), for use in sub-band coding (SBC) systems, using the McClellan transform [1]. It was recently shown that McClellan transform could be used to generate 2-D diamond shape QMF filters [2]. In this paper we will formalize the proofs of the diamond shape case, and generalize it to other shapes, sampling rasters and dimensions. Moreover we show that we do not really need the 1-D QMF filters: it is also possible and even more convenient to design QMF filter banks by performing transformations on a class of real valued polynomials.

Reference-contexts: This makes designing multidimensional QMF filters important. Such designs have been widely done for 1-D filters, but are more difficult for higher dimensions. The McClellan transform is a popular method to generate multidimensional filters from a simple multidimensional kernel, and a 1-D filter. In <ref> [2] </ref> the McClellan transform was used to design a 2-D diamond shape QMF filter, with good magnitude reconstruction properties by transforming a 1-D QMF filter, using a particular form of the 2-D kernel. The McClellan transform has also been used to generate m-D PRFB's [3] [4] [5]. <p> Remark 3 The proofs of the two theorems above are derived from simple algebraic manipulations (compare <ref> [2] </ref>). One can check that the essential ingredient of the proof is the equality S (z) = S (z). This equality guarantees that the polyphase decomposition of the 1-D filter bank is preserved when extracting S (z).
