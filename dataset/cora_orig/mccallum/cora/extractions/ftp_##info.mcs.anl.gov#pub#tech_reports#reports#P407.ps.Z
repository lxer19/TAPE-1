Reference-contexts: Shallow-water, weakly nonlinear interfacial waves appear as highly coherent groups having well-defined wavelength and are observed propagating shoreward on a density stratification, such as the picnocline. Their crests are generally oriented along isobaths <ref> [Apel1979, Baines1981] </ref>. Their wavelengths range from 200 to 1600 meters, depending on the depth, which can be considerably larger than the local water column depth. An estimate of the energy contained in the larger ones is in the order of 0:1 MJ/m 2 .

Reference-contexts: Some comparisons have been carried out with available data from the coast of Eastern Australia and New Foundland, however, the data was incomplete. Beardsley et al. <ref> [Beardsley et al.1985] </ref> have shown that in areas off the coast of Eastern United States the stratification required to support the propagation of internal waves occurs only during summer, a period in which less sedimentary movement has been observed.

Reference-contexts: Hence, in our formulation of the model for the internal wave case, we assume that the wave field is strictly unidirectional. As a result of experimental observations of sand structures acted upon by water waves <ref> [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Amos & Drapeau1990] </ref>, a two-dimensional model for the formation and evolution of sand ridges was proposed in [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Bona & Cohen1986].

Reference-contexts: It is also quite common in these numerical simulations for the bottom to reach its steady state in a gradual fashion rather than in small spurts of high activity followed by relative inactivity, a common observation in the formation of sand ripples <ref> [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Benjamin & Pritchard1987] </ref>. Since the temporal characterization of the evolution of actual sand ridges has not yet been systematically measured, it is difficult at present to judge whether the temporal behavior of the sand ridges created with the present model is in fact correct.

Reference-contexts: As a result of experimental observations of sand structures acted upon by water waves [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Amos & Drapeau1990], a two-dimensional model for the formation and evolution of sand ridges was proposed in <ref> [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Bona & Cohen1986] </ref>. This model was informally tested against field data, and based on encouraging results, was extended to three-dimensions, with the aim of making it more relevant to the ocean setting [Restrepo & Bona1993].

Reference-contexts: Preliminary experimental evidence supports the claim that a relation may exist between the features of the nonlinear long waves and the bars. Boczar-Karakiewicz et al. <ref> [Boczar-Karakiewicz, Paplinska & Winieki1981] </ref>, in a series of laboratory experiments, observed a relationship between the frequency, the amplitude, and the dispersion, in the waves and the bar spacing.

Reference-contexts: The interaction length is a local quantity which coincides with the distance in which the most energetic interactions in the spectrum of the nonlinear water waves takes place, rather than the recurrence distance 12 which some authors have supposed <ref> [Elgar, Freilich & Guza1991] </ref>. In the two wave packet case this distance would correspond to the length in which energetic interactions between the wave packets takes place and happens to coincide with the recurrence as defined [Elgar, Freilich & Guza1991] for the two-mode case. <p> waves takes place, rather than the recurrence distance 12 which some authors have supposed <ref> [Elgar, Freilich & Guza1991] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Sand ridges hundreds of meters long and up to a few meters high are usually found in groups, arranged in more or less parallel rows separated from each other by hundreds of meters oriented normal or at some small angle to the direction in which the overlying water waves propagate <ref> [McBride & Moslow1991] </ref>. Shallow-water, weakly nonlinear interfacial waves appear as highly coherent groups having well-defined wavelength and are observed propagating shoreward on a density stratification, such as the picnocline. Their crests are generally oriented along isobaths [Apel1979, Baines1981].

Reference-contexts: This model was informally tested against field data, and based on encouraging results, was extended to three-dimensions, with the aim of making it more relevant to the ocean setting <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>. In addition to complementing this last study, the present study shows how the mechanism may be extended to the situation in which a simply stratified ocean approximation is needed. <p> The primary motivation for considering the stratified case is that the mechanism is applicable in the deeper reaches of the continental shelf, and for reasons given later, it may be easier to test in the ocean setting than the version presented in <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>. A secondary motivation is to show how this model accounts for time-dependent forcing. Referring to Figure 1, we envision infragravity waves coming into the purview of the model at the line x = 0, where the long waves begin "feeling" the bottom topography. <p> Assume that O (ff) O (fi 2 ), and take H = O (1), rH = O (ff), j = O (ff), = O (ff). Further, consider the differentiations @ z ; @ t ; r = O (fi). Referring to the results from <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>, we calculate the kinetic energy in the lower layer using an approximation for the velocity potential, OE 1 (r; z; t) = 1 (r; t) 1 O (ff) O (fffi 2 ) O (fffi 2 ) so that K 1 = ae 1 R d 2 rf 2 <p> As discussed in <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>, only weak resonance is to be expected. <p> As shown in <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>, for high Reynolds flows, the equations of motion in the boundary layer are given by fi ~u 0t ~u 0nn = fiU 0bt p 0n = 0 (36) to lowest order. <p> ~u 0 d ~ t~u 0x i + h ~w 0 d ~ t~u 0n i R t ~u 0 d ~ t~v 0x i + h (39) It is assumed that the viscous boundary layer is sediment-laden, composed of cohesionless, rarely interacting sand particles. 9 The mass transport equation <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref> is @h (x; y; T ) = ae 0 where ae 0 is the mean sediment concentration and and are the shoreward mass flux and the longshore mass flux, respectively: j 0 j 0 Note that when weak y dependence scaling is adopted in Equation (40) the longshore <p> In the iteration process the boundary conditions are updated, should the conditions for the forcing are time dependent. 3 Qualitative Features of the Solutions Some of the main qualitative features of the full model were presented in <ref> [Restrepo & Bona1993] </ref>. Further examples are presented here and are meant to give the reader a more complete picture of the model's behavior.
