Title: A PIVOTAL METHOD FOR AFFINE VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES  
Author: MENGLIN CAO AND MICHAEL C. FERRIS 
Abstract: We explain and justify a path-following algorithm for solving the equations A C (x) = a, where A is a linear transformation from IR n to IR n , C is a polyhedral convex subset of IR n , and A C is the associated normal map. When A C is coherently oriented, we are able to prove that the path following method terminates at the unique solution of A C (x) = a, which is a generalization of the well known fact that Lemke's method terminates at the unique solution LCP(q; M ) when M is a P-matrix. Otherwise, we identify two classes of matrices which are analogues of the class of copositive-plus and L-matrices in the study of the linear complementarity problem. We then prove that our algorithm processes A C (x) = a when A is the linear transformation associated with such matrices. That is, when applied to such a problem, the algorithm will find a solution unless the problem is infeasible in a well specified sense.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical Algorithm We describe briefly a theoretical algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution in finitely many steps when the homeomorphism condition developed in [11] holds. This method is a realization of the general path-following algorithm described and justified in <ref> [3] </ref>. In what follows we use various terms and concepts that are explained in [3]. Related methods for finding stationary points of affine functions on polyhedral sets are given in [4, 5]. <p> This method is a realization of the general path-following algorithm described and justified in <ref> [3] </ref>. In what follows we use various terms and concepts that are explained in [3]. Related methods for finding stationary points of affine functions on polyhedral sets are given in [4, 5]. A more detailed description of an implementation of the method is given in the x3; here we deal with theoretical considerations underpinning the method. Other related work can be found in [1]. <p> Now construct a piecewise-linear manifold M from N C by forming the Cartesian product of each cell of N C with IR + , the non-negative half-line in IR. This M will be a PL (n + 1)- manifold in IR n+1 , as can easily be verified (see <ref> [3, Example 4.3] </ref>). <p> Now we apply the algorithm of <ref> [3] </ref> to the PL equation F (x; ) = 0, using a ray start at (w ( 1 ); 1 ) for some 1 &gt; 0 and proceeding in the direction (e; 1). <p> Now we apply the algorithm of [3] to the PL equation F (x; ) = 0, using a ray start at (w ( 1 ); 1 ) for some 1 &gt; 0 and proceeding in the direction (e; 1). As the manifold M is finite, according to <ref> [3, Th. 15.13] </ref> the algorithm generates, in finitely many steps, either a point (x fl ; fl ) in the boundary of M with F (x fl ; fl ) = 0, or a ray in F 1 (0) different from the starting ray. <p> The algorithm in question permits solving the perturbed system F (x * ; * ) = p (*), where p (*) is of the form p (*) = i=1 for appropriately chosen vectors p i . It is shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that p (*) is a regular value of F for each small positive *, and it then follows by [3, Th. 9.1] that for such *, F 1 (p (*)) is a connected 1-manifold Y (*), whose boundary is equal to its intersection with the boundary of M, and which <p> It is shown in [3] that p (*) is a regular value of F for each small positive *, and it then follows by <ref> [3, Th. 9.1] </ref> that for such *, F 1 (p (*)) is a connected 1-manifold Y (*), whose boundary is equal to its intersection with the boundary of M, and which is subdivided by the chords formed by its intersections with the cells of M that it meets. <p> Because we start on this ray, Y (*) cannot be homeomorphic to a circle, and therefore it is homeomorphic to an interval. A simple computation at the starting point shows that the curve index <ref> [3, x12] </ref> at that point is 1. By [3, Lemma 12.1] this index will be constant along Y (*). <p> Because we start on this ray, Y (*) cannot be homeomorphic to a circle, and therefore it is homeomorphic to an interval. A simple computation at the starting point shows that the curve index [3, x12] at that point is 1. By <ref> [3, Lemma 12.1] </ref> this index will be constant along Y (*). <p> A simple computation at the starting point shows that the curve index [3, x12] at that point is 1. By [3, Lemma 12.1] this index will be constant along Y (*). However, a computation similar to that in <ref> [3, Lemma 12.3] </ref> shows that in each cell of M, if the direction of Y (*) in that cell is (r; ) then (sgn )(sgn det T ) = 1 where T is the linear transformation associated with A C in the corresponding cell of N C . <p> We also have available a basis matrix corresponding to this extreme point along with a QR factorization, courtesy of stage two. The method that we use to solve this problem is precisely a realization of the general scheme for piecewise linear equations developed by <ref> [3] </ref>. The general method of Eaves (assuming a ray start and regular value v) moves along the curve F 1 (v) in the direction d 1 from x 1 and can be described as follows: 8 MENGLIN CAO AND MICHAEL C.

Reference-contexts: The calculations of dual variables and incoming columns are performed in a least squares sense using the currently available QR factorization. This factorization is updated at each pivot step either by using a rank-one update to the factorization or by adding a column to the factorization (see <ref> [6] </ref>). In order to invoke Lemma 3.1, we let y e = y fl + Y z fl be the feasible point needed to define (7).

Reference-contexts: We shall use this equivalence throughout this paper without further reference. A very familiar special case of (GE) is when C K is a polyhedral convex cone. Then it is easy to show that (GE) is equivalent to the generalized complementarity problem <ref> [7] </ref> z 2 K; A (z) a 2 K D ; hA (z) a; zi = 0 where K D := fz fl j hz fl ; ki 0; 8k 2 K g is the dual cone associated with K.

Reference-contexts: The pivotal technique that we describe here can be thought of as a generalization of the complementary pivot algorithm due to Lemke <ref> [8] </ref>. In x2 we describe the theoretical algorithm and apply several results of Eaves and Robinson to establish its finite termination for coherently oriented normal maps. <p> Therefore after finitely many steps it will actually have computed x 0 with A C (x 0 ) = a. Note that for linear complementarity problems, the above algorithm corresponds to Lemke's method <ref> [8] </ref>. It is well known that for linear complementarity problems associated with P-matrices, Lemke's method terminates at a solution. For variational inequalities, we have a similar result due to the analysis above. Theorem 2.3.

Reference-contexts: In fact we show how to generate y e as an extreme point of ~ C and further, how to project this extreme point into an extreme point of C. The following result is a well known characterization of extreme points of polyhedral sets <ref> [9, x3.4] </ref>. Lemma 3.2.

Reference-contexts: To see how do these definitions relate to the standard ones given in the literature on linear complementarity problems (e.g. <ref> [10] </ref> and [2]), consider the case that C = IR n + and + . Condition a) says that LCP (q; A) has a unique solution 0 for all q &gt; 0. <p> Similarly, there exists a diagonal matrix E 0 such that A T z 0 = EAz. Hence (EA + A T D)z = 0 where D; E 0 and Dz 6= 0. Thus the notion of L-matrix defined here is a natural extension of that presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. The following lemma shows that the class L-matrices contains the class copositive-plus matrices. Lemma 4.3. If a matrix A is copositive-plus with respect to a closed convex cone K, then it is an L-matrix with respect to K. Proof.

FERRIS In this work we will use the notion of a normal map due to Robinson <ref> [11] </ref>. The normal map, relating to a function F : IR n ! IR n and a non-empty, closed, convex set C, is defined as where C (x) is the projection (with respect to the Euclidean norm) of x onto the set C. <p> A PIVOTAL METHOD FOR AFFINE VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES 3 2.

The following is the central result from <ref> [11] </ref>. Theorem 2.2. The normal map A C is a Lipschitzian homeomorphism of IR n into IR n if and only if A C is coherently oriented. <p> Later in the paper, this condition will be weakened. The first step of the algorithm is to determine if C contains any lines. If it does, take orthonormal bases for lin C and its orthogonal complement according to the scheme explained in <ref> [11, Prop. 4.1] </ref>. The factoring procedure explained there shows how to reduce the problem to one (which we shall also write A C (x) = a) in a possibly smaller space, in which the set C appearing in this problem contains no lines. <p> The factoring procedure explained there shows how to reduce the problem to one (which we shall also write A C (x) = a) in a possibly smaller space, in which the set C appearing in this problem contains no lines.
