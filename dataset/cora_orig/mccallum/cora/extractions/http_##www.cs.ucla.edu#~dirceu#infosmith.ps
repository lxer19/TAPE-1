Abstract: This paper presents a feedback control algorithm for ATM congestion control in which source rates are adjusted according to VC queue lengths at intermediate nodes along the path. The goal is to "fill in" the residual bandwidth, without exceeding a specified queue threshold. In order to obtain this, we propose a simple and classical proportional controller, plus a Smith Predictor to overcome instabilities due to large propagation delays, as well as to avoid cell loss. We propose an effective EPRCA implementation in which each source computes its input rate based on the maximum VC queue length along the path. Theoretical and experimental results show that high throughput is achieved even with queue sizes independent of the round trip delay.

Reference-contexts: Many rate based algorithms can be found in literature. However none of these is completely satisfactory either for its complexity or for lack of stability properties, as is well reported in the excellent paper by Benmohamed and Meerkov <ref> [1] </ref>. In fact, due to transmission and propagation delay, most algorithms exhibit persistent oscillations. Furthermore, they have not been analyzed from the stability point of view, and so cannot guarantee the boundedness of the queues. <p> To our best knowledge, the Benmohamed and Meerkov's paper <ref> [1] </ref> is the first attempt to develop an analytic method for the design of congestion controllers which ensure good dynamic performance along with fairness in bandwidth allocation. However, the control law proposed in that paper requires a complex adjustment of control parameters in order to maintain stability and damp oscillations. <p> Finally we make a comparison with the PRCA scheme and report several simulations results. 2 The Model In this section we define the notation, and also present the models for the network, queue, and control law used throughout the paper. 2.1 Network Model We mainly follow the notation reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. The network consists of N = f1; ::ng nodes and L = f1; :::lg links. <p> This can be obtained if the upstream node of a congested link sends the feedback information, at every sampling time, to all the sources in the upstream direction, as in the Backward Congestion Notification (BCN) scheme. This is what is assumed in <ref> [1] </ref>. We call this type of scheme "Periodic Feedback Control". In systems where Forward Congestion Notification (FCN) scheme is used, like in the PRCA scheme, the source is responsible for transmitting a management cell RM every N RM data cells. <p> We first show the performance of the periodic control algorithm under the same scenario considered by <ref> [1] </ref>. Then we compare the proposed EPRCA scheme with the conventional PRCA scheme [4]. The network topology, shown in Fig. 8, is the same presented in [1]. Links have uniform speeds, normalized to 1 cell per unit of time [cell/s]. <p> We first show the performance of the periodic control algorithm under the same scenario considered by <ref> [1] </ref>.

Links to the right of the bottleneck have a bandwidth-delay product of 10 cells, while the links to the left of the bottleneck have zero propagation delay (similar to [1]). Five VC connections compete for bandwidth resources of a bottleneck link. VC connection activity (i.e. start and end time) is described in the table 1. We assume infinite backlog at each source. <p> Table 1: VC Connections Activity Connection # 1 2 3 4 5 Start Time 500 2500 1000 4000 5500 End Time 7000 10000 8500 10000 10000 Periodic Feedback We first show the performance of a periodic sampling version of our control scheme, in conditions similar to <ref> [1] </ref>. According to equation (5) we choose a sampling time 4 = 10. Figure 9 (a) shows the behavior of the five input rates, corresponding to connections S1S5, at source nodes.

Reference-contexts: In order to reduce oscillations it is necessary to reduce the amplification gain K, but this carries the drawback of a very long transient, i.e. the input rate is not able to fill in rapidly the queue, making the outgoing link underutilized <ref> [5] </ref>. To stabilize this system, still preserving the ability of quickly "filling in" the available queue space, we propose a classical Smith Predictor [3].

Reference-contexts: However, in ATM, feedback information is relayed in cells, and thus not available in continuous time, but rather in sampled form. Fortunately, the discrete time implemention of the Smith Predictor is simpler than the continuous one <ref> [7] </ref>. We start with the system model shown in Fig. 5. Here we place the controllers at edge source nodes for implementation simplicity. of view From Fig. 5, we note that the input rate u (t) takes the time T fw (feedforward delay) to reach the queue (an integrator).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, as a difference from a "blind" additive increase/multiplicative decrease policy, our scheme implements a feedback regulation which is based on a rigorous control model. Further research is in progress in order to use the proposed control algorithm with a common queue per link. Preliminary results were presented in <ref> [8] </ref>.
