Abstract: Resolving Result Set Contention in Heterogeneous Abstract Federated databases are one of the challenges for database system builders. In an effort to create these systems, current implementations require every member of the federation to agree to a particular standard. We examine query optimization under the Z39.50 standard for heterogeneous library information systems, looking specifically at the problem of managing temporary relations within a library system limiting the number of these relations held by a single user. We propose a strategy which uses knowledge of the current user query and an approximation of a set of future user queries in order to choose which temporary relation is the least likely to be useful in answer the current and future queries. Simulation results indicate that this strategy, called Look-Ahead, performs better than strategies based on operating system concepts. fl Work supported in part by a summer sabbatical from Baylor University

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Federated database management systems (FDBMS) must connect a variety of consumers with a variety of producers in such a way that both consumers and producers are satisfied. This subsumes difficult problems like schema integration [SL90], heterogeneous concurrency control <ref> [BST90] </ref>, and multi-system transaction processing [LMR90]. It also includes the very challenging problem of finding the best way to provide the services as in the case of query optimization. Within a heterogeneous environment, it is very difficult to determine the best method of answering a query.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the system is using the Z39.50 standard, which is currently being drafted for such systems <ref> [Den92] </ref>. The Z39.50 standard designates the site which submits the query as the origin, while the site (s) responding to the query are the targets. The answer to a query is called the result set.

Reference-contexts: The optimum R primarily minimizes network data transmission, secon darily minimizes origin workload, and finally minimizes target workload. It can be shown that r q = p q ( S R [r t ), and an algorithm exists which derives the optimum result resolutions <ref> [Don93] </ref>. 2.2 Result Set Deletion Strategies When browsing, a user may create a large number of result sets. Unfortunately, target systems may impose limits on the number of result sets owned by a single user or by a single origin site. <p> The number of possible future queries can be very large; therefore, it is not reasonable to derive every possible query. Instead, we need only derive a set of the most likely future queries. We use a simple algorithm which can quickly derive up to n MLE queries <ref> [Don93] </ref>. Our Look-Ahead strategy combines the current query and future (MLE) query optimization techniques. In the Look-Ahead strategy, the cost 0 (r i ) is still calculated for each result set, but in addition, a transmission and derivation penalty is calculated for the deletion of each result set.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 contains our conclusions and presents future work needed for this area. It should be noted that since we are working under the constraints of the Z39.50 protocol, this work is fundamentally different from other multidatabase query optimization techniques like DIRECT [MK92], Mermaid [TBD + 87], InterBase <ref> [ELLR90] </ref> and others. We do not have the capability to put servers of our own design on individual sites, but must instead use 3 the capabilities provided by the protocol to resolve and overcome these problems. However, problems similar to ours exist in all federated database systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, at some point, when the user asks a query, the target system will refuse to answer the query until one of the result sets is deleted. Since result sets derived from earlier user queries can be used to optimize future user queries <ref> [SD93] </ref>, the choice of which result set to delete can influence the response time of the system; therefore, the query optimizer must choose the correct result set to delete. This paper examines five possible approaches for selecting result set to delete including our proposed approach.
