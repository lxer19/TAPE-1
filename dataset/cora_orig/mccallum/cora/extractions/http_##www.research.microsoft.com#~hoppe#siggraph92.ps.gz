Abstract: We describe and demonstrate an algorithm that takes as input an unorganized set of points fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g IR 3 on or near an unknown manifold M, and produces as output a simplicial surface that approximates M. Neither the topology, the presence of boundaries, nor the geometry of M are assumed to be known in advance all are inferred automatically from the data. This problem naturally arises in a variety of practical situations such as range scanning an object from multiple view points, recovery of biological shapes from two-dimensional slices, and interactive surface sketching.

Reference-contexts: The critical subproblems are (with their standard time complexity): * EMST graph (O (n 2 * k-nearest neighbors to a given point (O (n + k log n)) * nearest tangent plane origin to a given point (O (n)) Hierarchical spatial partitioning schemes such as octrees [20] and k-D trees <ref> [2] </ref> can be used to solve these problems more efficiently. However, the uniform sampling density assumed in our data allows simple spatial cubic partitioning to work efficiently. The axis-aligned bounding box of the points is partitioned by a cubical grid.

Reference-contexts: The domain surface M is most commonly a plane embedded in IR 3 , in which case the problem is a standard one considered in approximation theory. The case where M is a sphere has also been extensively treated (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). Some recent work under the title surfaces on surfaces addresses the case when M is a general curved surface such as the skin of an airplane [16].

Reference-contexts: The problem is then to select orientations for the tangent planes so as to maximize the total cost of the graph. Unfortunately, this problem can be shown to be NP-hard via a reduction to MAX CUT <ref> [8] </ref>. To efficiently solve the orientation problem we must therefore resort to an approximation algorithm. Before describing the approximation algorithm we use, we must decide when a pair of nodes are to be connected in the graph.

Reference-contexts: The resulting simplicial surface can contain triangles with arbitrarily poor aspect ratio (Figure 2e). We alleviate this problem using a post-processing procedure that collapses edges in the surface using an aspect ratio criterion. 2 The final result is shown in guarantee bounds on the triangle aspect ratio <ref> [14] </ref>. 2 The edges are kept in a priority queue; the criterion to minimize is the product of the edge length times the minimum inscribed radius of its two adjacent faces.

Reference-contexts: On the practical side, a single algorithm that solves the general problem can be used to solve any specific problem instance. 1.1 Terminology By a surface we mean a compact, connected, orientable two-dimensional manifold, possibly with boundary, embedded in IR 3 (cf. O'Neill <ref> [17] </ref>). A surface without boundary will be called a closed surface. If we want to emphasize that a surface possesses a non-empty boundary, we will call it a bordered surface. A piecewise linear surface with triangular faces will be referred to as a simplicial surface.
