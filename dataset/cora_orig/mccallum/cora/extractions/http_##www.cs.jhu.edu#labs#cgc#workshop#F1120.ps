Reference-contexts: Though one might think that the corresponding offline problem, i. e. computing the optimal watchman route, is difficult, it has been shown <ref> [1] </ref> to be solvable in time O (n 4 ), n being the number of polygon vertices, which was later improved [7] to O (n 2 ).

Reference-contexts: For the important on-line problem it is a priori not clear if a competitive strategy exists; e. g. the related problem of searching for a goal in a general polygon admits no constant competitive factor [6]. At FOCS '91 a paper by Deng et al. <ref> [2] </ref> has appeared that claims for the first time that both rectilinear and general polygons can be learned by competitive strategies. For the rectilinear case, a full proof has appeared later in [3]. <p> For the rectilinear case, a full proof has appeared later in [3]. Here, a simple greedy strategy can be applied that guarantees a competitive factor of p For the more difficult case of general polygons, <ref> [2] </ref> discusses only the so-called greedy off-line tour that always walks to the closest point on the next essential cut. But it does not say how this can be done on-line and which competitive factor can be achieved. This however, is the major part of the problem.

For seeing all points of the polygon, a path is sufficient which can see all edges which are adjacent to reflex vertices.

Reference-contexts: So while moving in an unknown polygon, we only concentrate on reflex vertices and distinguish the explored and the unexplored vertices, i. e. those of which we have already seen the two adjacent edges, and those where at least one edge is still hidden. There is a result <ref> [5] </ref> which says that even for a polygon with only one reflex vertex, walking directly to this vertex is not competitive.
