Abstract: Learning from examples is a field of research in machine learning where class descriptions, like decision trees or implications (production rules or horn clauses) are produced using positive and negative examples as information. To solve this task many different heuristic search strategies have been developed, so far. The search by specialization is the most widely used search strategy, whereas other approaches use a search by generalization only. JoJo is an algorithm that combines both search directions into one search procedure. According to the estimated quality of the currently regarded rule either a generalization or specialization step is carried out by deleting or adding one premise to the conjunction part of the rule. But, to create an even more flexible (and faster) algorithm, it should be possible to delete or add more than just one premise at a time. Relaxing this restriction of JoJo led to the new highly flexible algorithm Frog that additionally uses a third search direction.

Reference-contexts: But, since it performs an exhaustive search it can be applied only to small data sets as it is impossible to find the minimal hypothesis in polynomial time (cf. <ref> [BEH87] </ref>). 2. Bi-directional Heuristic Search: JoJo Since it cannot be decided that either specialization or generalization should be prefered (cf.[Fen93]) in any general case, we developed the algorithm JoJo that integrates both search dirctions into one bi-directional process using a heuristic search strategy.

Reference-contexts: The ID3 ([Qui84]) and C4 ([Qui90b]) algorithms use a set of positive and negative examples for a class to derive a decision tree describing the class. The algorithms AQ ([MMH86]), CN2 ([ClN89], <ref> [ClB91] </ref>), JoJo ([Fen93], [FeW93]) and PRISM ([Cen87]) deal with the same task producing a set of production rules as classifier. In this paper we discuss the heuristic search strategies of the algorithms JoJo and Frog that both produce a set of rules to solve this classification problem.

Reference-contexts: The generalizer and the specializer compute, validate and order the descriptions that can be reached by the next generalization or specialization step using a predefined strategy and a predefined preference criterion. An example for a simple generalizer is H-RELAX (cf. <ref> [FeK92] </ref>): Conjunctions are generalized by deleting a premise. 4. Algorithms that work by specialization only have to start with the most general description so that they dont overlook possible solutions while only generalizing algorithms have to start with most specific descriptions 5.

Reference-contexts: Starting Points Contrary to algorithms that use just one search direction, JoJo is able to start at any arbitrary point in the lattice because using both search directions makes it possible that every rule in the lattice can be reached. 4 Heuristics for choosing appropriate starting points are discussed in <ref> [Fen93] </ref>. Furthermore, it is possible to carry out several program runs with different starting points.

In chapter two, we discuss the bidirectional search strategy of JoJo ([Fen93], <ref> [FeW93] </ref>, [FKN93]) that integrates generalization and specialization into one flexible algorithm. But even JoJos very general search strategy has a serious limitation. In every generalization or specialization step just one premise is deleted from or added to a rule. <p> An evaluation of JoJo and its extension to a four-step incremental procedure to refine, complete, reduce, and minimize a set of rules according to new examples is given in <ref> [FeW93] </ref>. <p> Otherwise, choose the best generalization if a possible generalization exists, i.e. a generalization with allowable error rate. Otherwise stop. The scheduler would prefer most-general (but correct) descriptions. The third main feature of JoJo, its immediate integration of an incremental learning procedure, is discussed in <ref> [FeW93] </ref>. Rules which are produced by JoJo or other algorithms can be refined by JoJo according to new examples which are introduced. The rules are used as starting points for the search for the refined rules. 3.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a rule can be specialized by adding a premise and be generalized by deleting a premise. 2 The above generalization problem is essentially a search problem.<ref> [Mit81] </ref>. The version space algorithm (cf. [Mit81]) is a classical algorithm that learns rules from a set of examples by using a dual search strategy. But, since it performs an exhaustive search it can be applied only to small data sets as it is impossible to find the minimal hypothesis in polynomial time (cf. [BEH87]). 2.
