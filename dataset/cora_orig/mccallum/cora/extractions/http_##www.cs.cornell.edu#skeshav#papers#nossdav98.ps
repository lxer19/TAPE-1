Abstract: We believe that current mechanisms for providing quality of service guarantees in integrated services networks have two major flaws. First, these mechanisms, such as signaling, scheduling, and reservations, require significant changes to the existing Internet. Second, they do not provide mechanisms for management of QoS state. In this paper, we present an alternative approach which attempts to provide macroscopic QoS guarantees through effective network management.

Reference-contexts: They are usually GUI-centric, painting pretty pictures of network status, rather than helping to find and fix network performance problems (for example, see HPs NetMetrix <ref> [1] </ref>). In the absence of good tools, scientific process and good engineering practice gives way to trial-and-error and a gut-feeling approach to performance management. For instance, network operators plan the layout and configuration of their network in an ad hoc manner.

Reference-contexts: We are developing algorithms and tools for each of these stages, as outlined next. We note in passing that current network management solutions deal only with stages (a) and (b). A significant exception is the Netsys suite of tools from Cisco <ref> [2] </ref>, which offers tools for all five phases of the lifecycle. This product, however, is proprietary, and we are not aware of public descriptions either of its algorithms or its effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: We discover a router either using SNMP (an SNMP GET returns the identity) or DNS (a lookup returns multiple IP addresses). We discover links by SNMP queries on routers or by carefully chosen traceroutes. Finally, we discover link speeds using Jacobsons pathchar program <ref> [3] </ref>. The discovered topology information is stored in a hierarchical file system. The attributes of each node are stored as files within a directory devoted to the node. This simplifies access to the topology.
