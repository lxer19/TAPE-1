Abstract: 1 This research is supported in part by grants from DARPA (F30602-96-1-0311), NSF (IRI-96-32225 and CDA-96-25374), and NYSSTF (423115-445). Abstract In this paper we describe our preliminary experiments to extend the work pioneered by Forrest (see Forrest et al. 1996) on learning the (normal and abnormal) patterns of Unix processes. These patterns can be used to identify misuses of and intrusions in Unix systems. We formulated machine learning tasks on operating system call sequences of normal and abnormal (intrusion) executions of the Unix sendmail program. We show that our methods can accurately distinguish all abnormal executions of sendmail from the normal ones provided in a set of test traces. These preliminary results indicate that machine learning can play an important role by generalizing stored sequence information to perhaps provide broader intrusion detection services. The experiments also reveal some interesting and challenging problems for future research.

Reference-contexts: As a result, much effort has been devoted to the problem of detecting intrusions as quickly as possible. There are two basic approaches to intrusion detection: Misuse Intrusion Detection: known patterns of (past) intrusions are used to identify intrusions as they happen, as in <ref> (Kumar and Spafford 1995) </ref> and STAT (Ilgun et al. 1995). Anomaly Intrusion Detection: recognizes behaviors that deviate from (recorded) normal behavior (as in (Forrest et al. 1996)).
