Reference-contexts: The corresponding permutation groups are denoted by G (p; d) and G odd (p; d). The group G (p; d) is clearly 2-transitive whereas G odd (p; d) is a maximal by inclusion odd subgroup of Sym (F ) (see <ref> [1] </ref>) and so 2-closed by 3.5. We say that a permutation group G Sym (V ) is cyclotomic if G ,! ' G (p; d) for some bijection ' : V ! F . 4.4. Here we consider primitive groups with primitive one point stabilizer.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that for k = 2 the first of them is equivalent to the Graph Isomorphism Problem (a modern knowledge of it can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>). In this paper we are interested in the other problem. According to [11] we define the k-closure G (k) of a permutation group G to be Aut (Orb (G)) and say that G is k-closed if G = G (k) . <p> Since the 2-closure problem is reduced to the Graph Isomorphism Problem, the 2-closure of any permutation group can be constructed in moderately exponential time (see <ref> [2] </ref>). We also mention a subex-ponential algorithm from [3] constructing the automorphism group of a tournament (and so solving the 2-closure problem for odd order groups) in time n O (log n) where n is the cardinality of V .

Reference-contexts: The essence of the method is the existence for each positive integer k a Galois correspondence between permutation groups on a finite set V and all partitions of V k (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Namely, to each permutation group G on V we associate a partition Orb k (G) which is the partition of V k into k-orbits of G, i.e. the orbits of the induced action of G on V k . <p> If G is primitive, noncyclic and K is transitive, then G " K is primitive (see <ref> [4] </ref>), which explains the name "primitive". 3.3. Let V be a linear space and GL (V ) be a group. Then the group o K can be viewed as a subgroup of GL (V X ) where V X = x2X V . <p> Moreover, the mapping S 7! (S) is a bijection by (4). Now we prove the fourth statement. Since G " K Sym (V ) " Sym (X) and the last permutation group is 2-closed by <ref> [4] </ref>, we have (G " K) (2) Sym (V ) " Sym (X). Let (fg x g; k) stabilize each 2-orbit of G " K where g x 2 Sym (V ), k 2 Sym (X). <p> For example, if G is a regular permutation group we come to the problem of finding the automorphism group of the S-ring over G generated by (as to S-rings see [10] and <ref> [4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The unity of Sym (V ) is denoted by id V . In all our algorithms a permutation group on V will be given by a set of at most n 2 generators (for this fact and the standard permutation group algorithms see <ref> [5] </ref>). If G is a group, then H G means that H is a subgroup of G. 3 2 Permutation and linear groups All undefined below notions concerning permutation and linear groups can be found in [10] and [9] respectively. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, within the same time one can find the set V =E where E = E (U ) is the decomposition (1) and the permutation group (G v ) E . According to <ref> [6] </ref> we have #G n 4 , so the permutation group G U can be found within the same time by exaustive search. <p> The algorithm IMBED is correctly defined and runs in time polynomial in n. Proof. The time upper bound is clear from #G n 4 (see <ref> [6] </ref>). If the group G appears as an input of Step 2, then it is cyclotomic by [9, x19.1 Cor. 2] and so ' is the required bijection.

It was remarked in <ref> [7] </ref> that the next interesting case is that of groups of odd order. This class is closed under 2-closure and by the famous Feit-Thompson theorem consists of solvable groups. The main result of the paper is a polynomial-time solution to the 2-closure problem in this case.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1.1 Let G be a permutation group of odd order on V . Then the generators of G (2) can be found in polynomial time in the cardinality of V . 2 It was proved in <ref> [8] </ref> that each primitive group of odd order is 4-closed. Combining this result and the above reduction of the k-closure problem to the 2-closure problem we obtain by Theorem 1.1 the following statement. Theorem 1.2 Let G be a primitive permutation group of odd order on V . <p> Since G G, G is a primitive permutation group and G v is a primitive linear group. On the other hand, if G is not cyclotomic, then G v cannot be imbedded in G (p; d) 0 (= (1; p d ) in notation of <ref> [8] </ref>). Then by [8, Th. 2.12] there exists U 2 Orb 1 (G v ) for which the permutation group (G v ; U ) is regular. <p> Since G G, G is a primitive permutation group and G v is a primitive linear group. On the other hand, if G is not cyclotomic, then G v cannot be imbedded in G (p; d) 0 (= (1; p d ) in notation of [8]). Then by <ref> [8, Th. 2.12] </ref> there exists U 2 Orb 1 (G v ) for which the permutation group (G v ; U ) is regular.

Reference-contexts: Here we make use of the fact that the intransitive action of the direct product as well as the imprimitive action of the wreath product preserves the property "to be 2-closed". To manage with primitive permutation groups of odd order we make use of Suprunenko's theory <ref> [9] </ref>. In this case a one point stabilizer G v , v 2 V can be viewed as an irreducible linear group over a prime field GF (p) for p &gt; 2. Using the algorithm BLOCK (see section 5) we proceed depending on the imprimitivity or primitivity of this group. <p> If G is a group, then H G means that H is a subgroup of G. 3 2 Permutation and linear groups All undefined below notions concerning permutation and linear groups can be found in [10] and <ref> [9] </ref> respectively. 2.1. Under a permutation group G = (G; V ) on a set V we mean a group G with a faithful action v 7! v g of G on V . We write 1 V instead of (id V ; V ). <p> Thus the condition of statement (4) of Proposition 3.1 is satisfied for such a group. 4 Odd primitive permutation groups 4.1. All facts cited in this subsection can be found for instance in <ref> [9] </ref>. Let G = (G; V ) be a solvable primitive permutation group. Then G has a uniquely determined normal subgroup H isomorphic to an elementary Abelian p-group of order p d for some prime p. <p> Then ' 0 = g 1 j U 0 is a linear isomorphism from U 0 on U . Collecting all ' 0 we obtain a linear isomorphism ' U : V ! U X such that ,! ' U o E (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Proposition 4.1 Let G = (G; V ) be a solvable primitive permutation group and U be a G v -block, v 2 V . <p> The algorithm IMBED is correctly defined and runs in time polynomial in n. Proof. The time upper bound is clear from #G n 4 (see [6]). If the group G appears as an input of Step 2, then it is cyclotomic by <ref> [9, x19.1 Cor. 2] </ref> and so ' is the required bijection. This proves the correctness of the algorithm for a non-cyclotomic G and after taking into account the end of 4.4 also for a cyclotomic one. Remark.
