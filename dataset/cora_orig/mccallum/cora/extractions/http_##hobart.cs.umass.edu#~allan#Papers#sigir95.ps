Title: Relevance Feedback With Too Much Data  
Author: James Allan 
Address: Amherst, MA 01003-4610  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts  
Abstract: Modern text collections often contain large documents that span several subject areas. Such documents are problematic for relevance feedback since inappropriate terms can easily be chosen. This study explores the highly effective approach of feeding back passages of large documents. A less-expensive method that discards long documents is also reviewed and found to be effective if there are enough relevant documents. A hybrid approach that feeds back short documents and passages of long documents may be the best compromise.

Reference-contexts: Such a method also has the advantage of making moot the question of whether passage retrieval is in fact selecting the relevant passage. This approach was taken in <ref> [KG95] </ref> where documents with more than 160 unique non-stopword terms were considered too big for feedback. These results of discarding such longer documents were encouraging, but they refer only to the massive feedback (large n) routing environment of TREC.

Reference-contexts: Oddly, passages have rarely been used for query expansion in a true relevance feedback or routing setting. One exception is <ref> [TT95] </ref> that discusses passage feedback in terms similar to part of this study, but not as broadly or in as much detail. 3.1 Optimum passage size We first set out to verify past experience regarding an optimum passage length.
