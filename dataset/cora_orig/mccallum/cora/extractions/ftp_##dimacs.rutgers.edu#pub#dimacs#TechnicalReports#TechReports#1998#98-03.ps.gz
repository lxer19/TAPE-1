Reference-contexts: However, numerous computational studies have shown that, in most practical cases, channel width may be very closely approximated by the so-called channel density, an easily computable quantity. Cell flipping was considered in <ref> [2] </ref> for minimizing total wire length in the more general custom cell technology, and was shown to lead to an NP-hard formulation. In [4] a cell flipping formulation was considered to satisfy channel density and net span constraints.

Reference-contexts: Cell flipping was considered in [2] for minimizing total wire length in the more general custom cell technology, and was shown to lead to an NP-hard formulation. In <ref> [4] </ref> a cell flipping formulation was considered to satisfy channel density and net span constraints. In case of one channel an efficient algorithm, based on 2-satisfiability, was proposed. Our purpose in this paper is to show a different pseudo-Boolean formulation for channel density minimization.

Reference-contexts: the cells in the upper row (resp. in the lower row) as a set of disjoint consecutive open intervals of the real line, it is easy to see that the only pairs of variables involved in clauses of F z correspond to the edges of the intersection graph (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>) of this family of intervals. The latter is bipartite without cycles (note that it may not be connected). Hence the intersection graph has at most n 1 edges. Therefore, there are at most n 1 pairs of variables involved in F z .
