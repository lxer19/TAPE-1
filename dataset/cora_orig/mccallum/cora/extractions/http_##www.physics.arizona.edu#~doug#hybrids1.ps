Abstract: Since gluons in QCD are interacting fundamental constituents just as quarks are, we expect that in addition to mesons made from a quark and an antiquark, there should also be glueballs and hybrids (bound states of quarks, antiquarks and gluons). In general, these states would mix strongly with the conventional qq mesons. However, they can also have exotic quantum numbers inaccessible to qq mesons. Confirmation

In addition, hybrid mesons can have exotic quantum numbers. Flavor nonsinglet hybrids with exotic quantum numbers are especially interesting because they cannot mix either with ordinary mesons or with glueballs. They can, however, mix with four quark (q qqq) states.

Reference-contexts: Again, we found that the P-wave operator gave a better signal. Finally, there are three 1 + operators. The first is a quark and antiquark in a "" state, with the color magnetic field. As is well known <ref> [9] </ref>, a 1 + hybrid can be constructed with the quark and antiquark in a relative S-wave state, and this is one of several arguments leading us to expect that it will be the lightest exotic hybrid.

Reference-contexts: These lattices were generated for quenched spectrum studies <ref> [10] </ref>. At 6=g 2 = 6:15 we evaluated propagators at five values of the Wilson hopping parameter, with the largest one chosen at approximately the charm quark mass. We used , , a 1 , and all of the exotic operators in Table 1 as source operators.

Reference-contexts: These mass estimates are crude by today's standards, but we need them only for approximately determining the lattice spacing. For 6=g 2 = 5:85 we include and mass estimates at additional values, done on a 12 3 spatial lattice, coming from our f B calculations <ref> [11] </ref>. At 6=g 2 = 5:85 we estimate 1= c = 6:205 (3) from extrapolating the squared pion masses from the largest four values.

Reference-contexts: However, we also note that in our studies of charmed pseudoscalar meson decay constants we find a discretization error in the decay constants of 10% to 15% at 6=g 2 = 6:15 <ref> [13] </ref>. It might be that decay constants are more sensitive to lattice spacing errors than mass, since the decay constants are basically wave functions at the origin, and are strongly affected by the coarseness of the lattice at short distance.

Reference-contexts: This 25 charmonium 1 + is quite far above the D D threshold. Because of the remaining systematic uncertainties, it is not clear whether it is above the S wave + P wave D D threshold, which in many model calculations determines whether its decay width is large <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. At the strange quark mass (our largest at 6=g 2 = 6:15), we estimate the mass of the 1 + hybrid to be 2170 80 systematic MeV.

For example, Close and Page characterize the (4040) and (4160) states as mixtures of cc and ccg [24]. Close proposes that hybrid states could help explain the "anomalous" production of charmonium observed by the CDF group [25].

Reference-contexts: We briefly review the observational evidence relevant to our results. The particle data table <ref> [16] </ref> does not list any confirmed 1 + hybrid meson states. However a number of potential candidates are mentioned. There is some evidence for a 1 + hybrid state with a mass of around 1:4 GeV, and another with a mass around 1:9 GeV. <p> Only the bag model calculation obtains a mass close to the E852 experimental result. Unfortunately, no good candidates for the theoretically expected 1 + hybrid charmonium state have been observed <ref> [16] </ref>. Such a state is also expected in flux tube models, which are most plausible for heavy quark systems and furthermore provide information about branching ratios. Table 6 also contains some predictions (taken from [15]) for the mass of the 1 + state in the charmonium system.
