Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The subsumption architecture was described initially in <ref> [Brooks 86] </ref> and later modified in [Brooks 89] and [Connell 89]. The subsumption compiler compiles augmented finite state machine (AFSM) descriptions into a special purpose scheduler to simulate parallelism and a set of finite state machine simulation routines.
