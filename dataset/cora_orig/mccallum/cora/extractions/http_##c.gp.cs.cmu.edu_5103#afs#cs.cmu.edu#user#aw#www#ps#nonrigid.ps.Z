Title: Fast Animation and Control of Nonrigid Structures

Abstract: We describe a fast method for creating physically based animation of non-rigid objects. Rapid simulation of non-rigid behavior is based on global deformations. Constraints are used to connect non-rigid pieces to each other, forming complex models. Constraints also provide motion control, allowing model points to be moved accurately along specified trajectories. The use of deformations that are linear in the state of the system causes the constraint matrices to be constant. Pre-inverting these matrices therefore yields an enormous benefit in performance, allowing reasonably complex models to be manipulated at interactive speed.

Reference-contexts: This association allows us to express the body's inertial proprties, in particular its kinetic energy, as a function of the deformation parameters and their time derivatives. Once we have expressed the kinetic and potential energies as a function of the parameters, Lagrange's equations of motion (see <ref> [8] </ref> or any other classical mechanics text) provide a cookbook procedure for deriving the equations of motion, producing a generalization of the familiar f = ma: In the parlance of Lagrangian dynamics, the vector of parameters constitute the system's generalized coordinates, which we will denote by q.

Reference-contexts: This formulation provides objects that deform in a geometrically simple but physically correct way. A further simplification is achieved by restricting attention to deformations that are linear in the system's state variables. This class includes both free-form deformations of the sort described in <ref> [14] </ref>, and simpler affine deformations. One beneficial effect of this simplification is that the body's mass matrix is constant, allowing it to be pre-inverted. Attachment constraints.
