Reference-contexts: Rather than using an active set approach <ref> [10, 9] </ref>, we follow the strategy of interior point methods (see for example [12, 26, 18]) and associate with (1.2) the following barrier problem in the variables x and s min f (x) i=1 subject to g E (x) = 0 g I (x) + s = 0; where &gt; 0 <p> the presentation we define z = x ! m I X ln s (i) ; (1.9) g I (x) + s ; (1.10) and rewrite the barrier problem (1.3) as min '(z) subject to c (z) = 0: (1.11) We now apply the sequential quadratic programming method (see for example <ref> [10, 9] </ref>) to this problem. <p> We now digress to discuss the relationship between our approach and other interior point methods. 1.1 KKT Systems It is known that Sequential Quadratic Programming, in at least one formulation, is equivalent to Newton's method applied to the optimality conditions of a nonlinear program <ref> [9] </ref>. This relationship can be used to establish a connection between our approach and other interior point methods.

As in affine scaling methods <ref> [12] </ref>, we can restrict the displacement d s to be less than a certain fraction of the distance to the first non-negativity constraint.

Reference-contexts: In practice it may be advantageous to handle the steps in x and s separately and to use non-symmetric trust region shapes; see for example <ref> [15] </ref>. The algorithmic framework given in x1 can be used to implement primal or primal-dual interior point methods. <p> In this paper we have focused on primal methods because they are easier to implement, and we have devoted much attention to their global convergence properties because the analysis provides important clues on how to design the algorithms. Computational experience with the primal interior point method is given in <ref> [15] </ref>; that paper also provides some preliminary computational results with primal-dual methods. Another question to be dealt with is how to ensure that a good rate of convergence is obtained.

Reference-contexts: Several modifications to (1.15) have been proposed to make the constraints consistent [5, 4, 22], and in this paper we follow the approach of Byrd [3] and Omojokun [19], which we have found suitable for solving large problems <ref> [17] </ref>. The strategy of Byrd and Omojokun consists of first taking a vertical (or transversal) step v that lies well inside the trust region and that attempts to satisfy the linear constraints in (1.15) as well as possible. <p> Lalee, Nocedal and Plantenga <ref> [17] </ref> describe an iterative procedure for approximately solving (1:17) in the case when the number of variables is large. 3 We now need to decide if the trial step d obtained from (1.17) should be accepted, and for this purpose we introduce a merit function for the barrier problem (1.11). (Recall <p> becomes min kg k + s k + A &gt; s.t. k (u x ; ~ ffi k u s )k T ~ k : In the case where the trust region norm is the Euclidean norm on u and ~ ffi k = 1, it is straightforward to show <ref> [17] </ref> that (2:12) has a solution in the range of S k : (2.13) But for other norms, or when ~ ffi k 6= 1, this can only be guaranteed if kg k + s k k is small enough. <p> We should also mention that since our merit function is non-differentiable, getting fast convergence may necessitate use of a second-order correction or a watch-dog strategy to avoid the Maratos effect. Our computational experience with equality constrained problems <ref> [17] </ref> indicates that use of a second-order correction can be an efficient strategy for this purpose.

Several researchers, including Yamashita <ref> [25] </ref> have noted this relationship.
