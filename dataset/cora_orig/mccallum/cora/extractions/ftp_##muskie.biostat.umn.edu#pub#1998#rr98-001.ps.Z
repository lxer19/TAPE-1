Abstract: Under a Bayesian approach to a hierarchical model, interest often lies in summarizing the posterior distribution of a parameter in order to enable easy comparison across prior structures. This can be done, for example, through quantile or interval estimation. When using an MCMC algorithm such as the Gibbs sampler to generate a sample from the posterior of interest, calculations are often easier when done on a per-iteration basis, with the final result then taken from a combination across iterations; this is often called "Rao-Blackwellization." Such an approach is not yet used in the calculation of credible regions. We examine the performance of a weighted-average estimator of the endpoints of a credible region, and compare it to other alternatives including a nave average estimator, an order statistics estimator, and an estimator based on density estimation. We obtain theorems showing when there is convergence to the true interval and discuss Central Limit Theorems for these estimators. An animal epidemiology example is used to examine the estimators' numerical behavior.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear, however, how to choose the bandwidth for a dependent sample such as a Markov chain, since the correlation within the Markov chain increases the variance of the kernel density estimator. Since in addition strong assumptions may be required to provide asymptotic convergence <ref> (Chen, 1994) </ref>, we will not utilize this kernel technique. Gelfand and Smith (1990) also state that the CMDE is better than the KMDE based on a Rao-Blackwell Theorem based argument; a sketch of a proof is provided 8 there.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, DiCiccio and Martin (1991) present analytic approximations to tail areas, which can be applied to a Bayesian hierarchical model, but which can also be computationally cumbersome <ref> (see Strawderman, 1997) </ref>. Severini (1993) discusses Bayesian intervals which are also confidence intervals in the frequentist sense. Nicolaou (1993) addresses the same topic, where priors are chosen specifically to yield Bayesian intervals with good frequentist performance, and estimation is done in the presense of nuisance parameters.

Reference-contexts: From the Ergodic Theorem we also know that: 1 t X j;x (j i ; x) = ^ jx (jx) ! jx (jx) (5) t i=1 a:s: as t ! 1, with no additional regularity conditions required. Similar statements can be made for the posterior density and distribution of <ref> (Tierney, 1994) </ref>. The Gibbs sampler thus provides us with a sample from both jx (jx) and jx (jx), and with a way to estimate jx (jx) to a high degree of precision as well.
