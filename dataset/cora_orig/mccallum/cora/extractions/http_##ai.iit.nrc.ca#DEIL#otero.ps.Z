Abstract: The area of Expert Systems will benefit from the inclusion of automatic rules induction extending the expert's knowledge. A study for the inclusion of inductive learning in Temporal Expert Systems is presented. We begin by defining a correspondence between the formalisms of the Expert System and the inductor, addressing the requirements introduced by time in the selection of classes, examples and descriptors. Secondly, the expresiveness of the induced temporal rules is enhanced using constructive induction and Qualitative Physics to fit the needs of the Expert System.

Reference-contexts: This requirement needs to be present in the inductor's features in order to select the desired knowledge. Our aim in this work is to report on a study for introducing learning in Expert Systems developed with an environment for Temporal Expert Systems called Medtool <ref> [1] </ref>. This environment has a particular knowledge representation and reasoning formalism Generalized Magnitudes scheme- intended for building Expert Systems in domains where temporal representation and reasoning are required. <p> Finally, in section 5 the previous ideas are combined to obtain a set of more powerful temporal descriptors. 2 2 Temporal Expert Systems in Medtool Our basic orientation in defining the Generalized Magnitudes formalism <ref> [1] </ref> has been to give the ES's builder the ability to represent almost all he needs to build an usable Temporal ES, rather than establishing theoretical but difficult-to-use temporal formalisms. Knowledge in the Generalized Magnitudes formalism, is structured around the facts the system knows rather than around itself.

Reference-contexts: The environment is oriented to the Medical domain in which several ESs have been developed in the context of previous projects (ESPRIT I P1592) <ref> [2] </ref> and are currently in use at hospitals. The Temporal Expert Systems developed with Medtool maintain a database of facts describing the subject's history. Besides, a Medtool ES can manage several subject's instances (patients) maintaining a separate database for each one.

Reference-contexts: In the Medical domain, the relevant knowledge is always in the form of subject-independent knowledge. So, we always select the examples from the whole set of patients. This can be not so valid in other domains, for example for the induction of Discrete Event structures in Systems Theory <ref> [3] </ref>, where most of times a single subject (system) is considered. 5 4 Enhancing the induced knowledge Once we have translated the ES's facts into the inductor's language to become usable, we must address the "inverse" compatibility to incorporate the induced rules as knowledge in the ES. <p> On the other hand, some constructive induction issues has been added that allow the inductor to suggest new descriptors both temporal and non-temporal. The methods introduced here, are proving to be useful for the automatic induction of Discrete Event Systems <ref> [9, 3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We have shown how these rules enter the Knowledge Base as knowledge expressions associated to the class-GM, so structural compatibility is already addressed. In this section the expresiveness of both the inductor and ES's languages will be related. Pure induction algorithms like AQ-family <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, generate characteristic descriptions that need to be enhanced with regard to their representational capacity in order to become comparable to the expert's knowledge in the ES. This statement becomes fundamental in inducing temporal knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The effect of this issue on temporal induction will be treated in section 5. Constructive induction also allows us to manage numerical variables in a better way than the classical management through intervals. We can begin with data driven constructive induction <ref> [6] </ref> that constructs new descriptors on 6 the basis of the initial descriptors and some basic arithmetical operators, like A + B; A fl B, : : : But, unlike many DCI systems, we will not obtain new descriptors before the induction process but during the process, and hence only those

Reference-contexts: From the study of these data, one or a set of expressions must be obtained that covers the whole set of examples. This is related to the work done by Falkenheiner and Michalski in <ref> [8] </ref>. In this case, relational operators like &lt;; &gt;; 6= will not be used because we need assign a value to the class-GM.
