Abstract: This is the abstract of my paper. It must fit within the size allowed, which is about 3 inches, including section title, which is 11 point bold font. If you don't want the text in italics, simply remove the 'em' command and the curly braces which bound the abstract text. If you have em commands within an italicized abstract, the text will come out as normal (non-italicized) text.

Reference-contexts: Heading text is 11 point bold font. Paragraphs are indented one pica. There is no blank line between paragraphs. Throughout I may cite references of the form <ref> [1] </ref> or [2], and LaTeX will keep track of numbering. The numbers are based on the order you place them in the bibliography, not the order they appear in the text. They should (I believe) be in alphabetical order.
