Abstract: This paper describes four scheduling algorithms and two packet-dropping algorithms for transmitting soft-real-time variable-bit-rate traffic in a packet-switched network. Simulation results show that the first-come-first-serve algorithm, which is equivalent to the earliest-deadline-first algorithm when all packets have equal relative deadlines, outperforms the timed-token algorithm as well as two other real-time scheduling algorithms. We also simulated the last-in-first-discard (LIFD) algorithm as well as a more complex (1; k) packet-dropping algorithm which, for each stream, tries to drop no more than 1 packet in any sequence of k packets. We found that although the (1; k) dropping algorithm does significantly reduce the failure rate, the same reduction in this failure rate can be achieved by slightly lowering the network utilization and using the simpler LIFD algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Because the higher complexity of the (1; k) dropping algorithm reduces the achievable transmission rate of the switches and effectively reduces the achievable utilization of the network by a comparable amount, the simple LIFD algorithm performs just as well as the more complex (1; k) dropping algorithm. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Clark et al. presented the FIFO+ algorithm for scheduling soft-real-time VBR traffic and compared its performance to the WRR algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Best-effort or data traffic has no delay requirement, but short average delay is desired. Best-effort traffic such as data requires lossless transmission, but reliable delivery is usually handled in the higher layer protocols. Several algorithms have been proposed to handle hard-real-time traffic <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17] </ref> while best-effort traffic may be handled using the well-known methods used in today's packet-switched networks. In contrast there are not yet good methods for handling soft-real-time traffic such as compressed audio or video. <p> We assume the network is connection-oriented, transmits messages as fixed-size packets or cells (e.g., ATM cells), and provides some type of admission control. We simulate the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) algorithm as well as three algorithms designed for hard-real-time constant-bit-rate (CBR) traffic: the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [2, 10] </ref> algorithm, the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm [11], and the timed-token (TT) algorithm [6].

While this seems likely for all interactive traffic, for example, this assumption may not hold if playback traffic and interactive traffic are mixed. As pointed out in <ref> [3] </ref> a single FCFS queue does not provide flexibility in assigning different delays or quality-of-service. Separating different classes of traffic into multiple queues may provide more flexibility, but it may also reduce the achievable statistical multiplexing gain.

Reference-contexts: Our work differs from theirs in that we include a comparison of the FCFS algorithm to the TT algorithm and discuss the conditions under which the FCFS algorithm is able to transmit all packets by their deadlines. In <ref> [7] </ref>, Hamdaoui and Ramanathan presented a method for scheduling soft-real-time traffic with a (m; k) loss requirement where the network is allowed to drop at most m packets in any sequence of k packets. Our (1; k) dropping algorithm is a special case of their algorithm where m = 1.
