Title: Reliable Communication over Partially Authenticated Networks  
Author: Amos Beimel Matthew Franklin 
Keyword: Key Words: Reliable Communication, Private Communication, Authentication Keys, Graph Connectivity, Byzantine Failures.  
Date: January 14, 1998  
Abstract: Reliable communication between parties in a network is a basic requirement for executing any protocol. In this work, we consider the effect on reliable communication when some pairs of parties have common authentication keys. The pairs sharing keys define a natural "authentication graph", which may be quite different from the "communication graph" of the network. We characterize when reliable communication is possible in terms of these two graphs, focusing on the very strong setting of a Byzantine adversary with unlimited computational resources.

All of the processors cooperate to execute some protocol, but some of them are maliciously faulty. Dolev <ref> [4] </ref> and Dolev et al.

Notice that if there is an edge between u and v then the graph is (t; u; v)-connected for every t and there is no (u; v)-separating set. 3 All-Pairs Reliable Communication In this section we characterize when reliable transmission between every pair of parties is possible.

Reference-contexts: We present a general protocol for private and reliable transmission that succeeds if G is (t + 1; a; b)-connected and reliable communication is possible. A very similar protocol appeared previously in <ref> [9] </ref>. We use this protocol to show that for both all-pairs and single-pair, the sufficiency condition for reliable communication from a to b and from b to a is a sufficient condition for reliable communication with privacy. We formally define private transmission.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, no previous papers addressed reliability in partially authenticated networks. The tasks we consider in this paper bear some relation to practical group communication tasks <ref> [10] </ref>. Reliable multicast protocols are often designed to operate in distributed adversarial environments similar to the ones we consider. When these multicast protocols are built on top of a network of reliable single-receiver channels, then they could be implemented directly from our results.

Reference-contexts: We mention that in Byzantine agreement all honest parties should agree on the same message while in reliable communication only the transmitter and the receiver agree on the message. Digital signatures have been used for Byzantine agreement, see, e.g. [15] and discussion and references in <ref> [13] </ref> (some of these reference use the term authentication for digital signatures). Signatures are stronger than authenticated messages, which are used in our work. They enable the signer to sign the message such that every other party can verify the signature, but cannot sign a different message.
