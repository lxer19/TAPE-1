Reference-contexts: Each connection carries multiple streams of real-time data that must be delivered from one end of the connection to the other end in time. Other variations of the classical ow shop and job shop models are ow shop with recurrence and periodic ow shop and job shop <ref> [12] </ref>. In a ow shop with recurrence, each task executes more than once on one or more processors. This variation models a system that does not have a dedicated processor for ev ery function.

Reference-contexts: We can also view a n end-to-end schedule produced independently by the individual schedulers as a priority-driven schedule based on decisions that are at best locally optimal. It is known that priority-driven scheduling strategies have unacceptably poor worst-case performance in systems that contain functionally dedicated processors <ref> [16] </ref>. In despite of all the preliminary evidence against it, local scheduling approach should be thoroughly evaluated for two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Under the assumptions stated above, there is no choice but to schedule the subtasks on each processor completely on-line. It is known that the performance of completely on-line scheduling is poor <ref> [21] </ref>. We can also view a n end-to-end schedule produced independently by the individual schedulers as a priority-driven schedule based on decisions that are at best locally optimal. It is known that priority-driven scheduling strategies have unacceptably poor worst-case performance in systems that contain functionally dedicated processors [16].

Reference-contexts: In this way, we can reduce the update frequency of the global information and improve the responsiveness of the system. A well-known example of strategies for combining global and local decisions is delta routing in networks <ref> [22] </ref>. Analogous strategies for combining global information with local information to make end-to-end scheduling more responsive and robust while keeping the cost of maintaining status information low should be explored. Specifically, hybrid scheduling strategies combine off-line scheduling based on global information with on-line scheduling based on local information.
