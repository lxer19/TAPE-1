Abstract: whether to make query an object or an operation. As all our rules are based on the structure of the sentence, such decisions cannot be made by the program. As noted earlier, a program that will automatically produce a perfect object diagram from the specifications document is still a dream. But our program can be used to validate an object diagram given the specification document and to generate a preliminary object diagram that can be refined by a human designer. The following enhancements suggest themselves as future directions for our research: Comparing the results of our semi-automatic validation with that produced in a design review, both for thor oughness and cost-effectiveness.
