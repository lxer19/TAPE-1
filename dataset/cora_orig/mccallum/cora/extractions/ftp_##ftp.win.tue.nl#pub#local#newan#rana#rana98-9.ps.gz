Abstract: Immiscible two-phase flow in porous media can be described by the fractional flow model. If capillary forces are neglected, then the saturation equation is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law, known as the Buckley-Leverett equation. This equation can be numerically solved by the method of Godunov, in which the saturation is computed from the solution of Riemann problems at cell interfaces. At a discontinuity of permeability this solution has to be constructed from two flux functions. In order to determine a unique solution an entropy inequality is needed. In this article an entropy inequality is derived from a regularisation procedure, where the physical capillary pressure term is added to the Buckley-Leverett equation. This entropy inequality determines unique solutions of Riemann problems for all initial conditions. It leads to a simple recipe for the computation of interface fluxes for the method of Godunov.

Reference-contexts: These equations are completed by two state equations, one expressing that the pore space is filled only with the two fluids and the other expressing that the difference of the pressures of both phases is equal to the capillary pressure (see <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 16, 19] </ref>). The set of equations can be rewritten into the so-called fractional flow model, consisting of a saturation equation for the wetting phase and an equation for the total velocity. In this article the total velocity is assumed to be known. <p> In this article the total velocity is assumed to be known. If capillary forces are neglected, i.e. the capillary pressure is assumed to be equal to zero, then the saturation equation is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law. It is known as the Buckley-Leverett equation (see <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 16, 19] </ref>). If gravity is neglected, then the flux function is monotone. However, if the vertical component of the total velocity is small compared to the product of density, gravitational acceleration and mobility, then the vertical component of the flux function is non-monotone. <p> A necessary condition for monotonicity of the vertical component of the flux function is given in [6]. In Section 2 a necessary and sufficient condition is proved. The Buckley-Leverett equation can be numerically solved by several conservative schemes, e.g. the method of Godunov (see <ref> [1, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 18] </ref>). In this method the saturation is approximated by a function that is constant in each discretisation cell. The solution at a new time level is computed from the solution of Riemann problems at cell interfaces. <p> The solution of a Riemann problem for the Buckley-Leverett equation is well-known if gravity is neglected and if the porous medium is homogeneous. In this case the flux function is monotone and the solution can be constructed from the convex or concave hull of the flux function (see <ref> [1, 5, 16] </ref>). The usage of such a hull is an immediate consequence of the so-called entropy inequality. The proper choice of the entropy inequality can be derived from a regularisation procedure, i.e. a small diffusion term is added to the Buckley-Leverett equation (see [13]). <p> Adding a linear diffusive term or the physical capillary pressure term leads to the same entropy inequality (see Section 3). The same construction for the solution of a Riemann problem can be used if gravity is included (see <ref> [1, 16, 17, 19] </ref>). The influence of a piecewise heterogeneity on the solution of the Buckley-Leverett equation is studied in [16] for some typical examples. At a discontinuity of permeability the solution has to be constructed from a horizontal jump from the left to the right flux function. <p> The two phases are linked by the state equations S w + S nw = 1 and p nw p w = p c (S w ), where the capillary pressure p c [Pa] is a given function of saturation (see <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 16, 19] </ref>). In this study, a rigid isotropic medium is considered, i.e. porosity, absolute permeability and relative permeabilities are assumed to be independent of time whilst the tensor K reduces to a scalar K. <p> It is the limiting lowest saturation that can be achieved through attempts of displacement of a phase from the porous medium by the other phase. Typical curves of relative permeability are shown in <ref> [1, 3, 5, 10, 16, 19] </ref>. <p> Typical curves of relative permeability are shown in [1, 3, 5, 10, 16, 19].
