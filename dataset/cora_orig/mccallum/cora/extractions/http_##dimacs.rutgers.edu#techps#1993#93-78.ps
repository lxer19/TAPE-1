Title: On reducing the cut ratio to the multicut problem  
Author: Nabil Kahale 
Abstract: We compare two multicommodity flow problems, the maximum sum of flow, and the maximum concurrent flow. We show that, for a given graph and a given set of k commodities with specified demands, if the minimum capacity of a multicut is approximated by the maximum sum of flow within a factor of ff, for any subset of commodities, then the minimum cut ratio is approximated by the maximum concurrent flow within a factor of O(ff ln k).

Reference-contexts: It is intuitively clear that the value of any feasible flow from s to t is at most the capacity of any cut separating s and t. A well known result by Ford and Fulkerson <ref> [1] </ref> states that in fact, the value of the maximum flow between s and t is equal to the minimum capacity of a cut between s and t.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the case with only one commodity, the max-flow is not equal to the minimum capacity of a multicut. However, an approximate min-max theorem holds in this case: the max-flow is lower bounded by the minimum capacity of a multicut <ref> [2] </ref> divided by a factor proportional to ln k. fl DIMACS, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08855. <p> For each cut U , denote by dem (U ) the sum of the demands of the commodities with exactly one endpoint in U .

Note that using the algorithm by Garg, Vazirani and Mihalis <ref> [2] </ref> for finding a multicut within a factor of O (ln k) from the max-flow, one can deduce immediately from Theorem 1 an algorithm for finding a cut ratio within a factor of O (ln 2 k) from the maximum concurrent multicommodity flow. <p> Such an algorithm was derived directly in <ref> [2, 7] </ref>, as was mentioned in the introduction. 4 Acknowledgments The author is grateful to R.

Theorem 4 For any instance of the multicommodity flow problem, we have (1= ln k) min F (A) f min F (A) : (10) Proof As in [7], we decompose the commodities into groups Q r , for r 1, such that Q r consists of the commodities with demands between (4k) r1 d min and (4k) r d min . <p> Quantities related to the multicommodity flow problem of the group Q r will be superscripted by r. The following lemma is central in our analysis: Lemma 1 <ref> [7] </ref> f (1=4) min r f r : We now apply theorem 3 to each group Q r . First, we note that the sum of demands of the commodities in each group is upper bounded by a factor of 4k 2 from the minimum demand in that group. <p> Such an algorithm was derived directly in <ref> [2, 7] </ref>, as was mentioned in the introduction. 4 Acknowledgments The author is grateful to R.
