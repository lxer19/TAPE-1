Reference-contexts: Sometimes, however, there may be extra information (for example, from the bidding) which indicates that the Queen is with West. Is it now hopeless to make three tricks? No, there is one chance, and that is that East has the 10. Goren <ref> [Goren 86] </ref> describes the correct play as: "...execute what is known as the backward finesse, leading the Jack first. Notice that you must not lead the Ace first. <p> In addition to being used in an attempt to remove the defence's high cards, ducking may also be employed as a means of retaining control in a suit. This is illustrated by the following example from <ref> [Goren 86] </ref>. N S 6 3 "The North hand has no other entries than Spades, and your object is to win five tricks. It can be seen that regardless of how the adverse cards are distributed one trick must be lost in any event.

Reference-contexts: The problem to which we will turn our attention first, then, is how the decisions on the applicability of tactics can be made. This is achieved by the use of methods. 2.3.1 Methods in Clam As described in the Clam Users' Manual <ref> [Harmelen 90] </ref>, methods are the basic stuff that make up proof plans. They are specifications of tactics, which are procedures which execute a (large) number of proof steps as a single operation. In Clam, a method is a structure with 6 `slots': 1. <p> The method specifications needed to deal with such diversity threaten to be large, ad hoc, and difficult to understand. Since van Harmelen <ref> [Harmelen 90] </ref> says that "Part of the goal of the whole proof plan enterprise is to try and formulate a good language for controlling proof search, and this language should exactly be the one used inside the method slots," it has to be questionable as to whether this is the right <p> A difficulty that is likely to trouble any solution is that even the notion of Critical cards is not fixed, but relative to a set of possibly changing methods. 45 CHAPTER 4. THE PRE-PLANNER 46 4.1 Iterators <ref> [Harmelen 90] </ref> describes iterators as follows: It is possible to create a new method out of a given set of methods by constructing an iterator . This iterator will exhaustively apply the elements of the given set until none of them apply any longer.

Reference-contexts: Converting this `knowledge' into rules that could be expressed as essentially declarative code was one of the major challenges of this project. In designing Python, however, <ref> [Nygate 84] </ref> found an area of Bridge for which a standard text ([Love 59]) did attempt to lay down some rules.

Reference-contexts: involves the possibility of `interference' between lines of play in different suits (e.g, in a `ruff-and-discard' situation, the declarer has to be aware of the losers that can be discarded in each suit). * The addition of a probability database (eventually including the kind of knowledge-based inference system described in <ref> [Quinlan 79] </ref>) would be a necessary part of the system, since it would ensure the probabilities assigned to the qualitative measures in the interpretation trees would be consistent with the current knowledge available to the declarer, and also help to decide when re-planning became necessary. * Least specifically, while Finesse is

Reference-contexts: Based on the formulae in its interpretation trees, Finesse calculates (correctly) that the probability of success of this line of play is 0:75 (the second finesse will lose only when both missing cards are in East's hand). Example 8 N S 7 6 4 EW Q 10 2 In <ref> [Reese 91] </ref> the above situations are analysed as follows: "As usual, declarer begins by finessing the lowest card of the combination.
