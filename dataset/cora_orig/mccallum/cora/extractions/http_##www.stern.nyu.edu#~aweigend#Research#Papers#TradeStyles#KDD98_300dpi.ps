Abstract: This study uncovers trading styles in the transaction records of US Treasury bond futures. We use statistical clustering techniques to group together trades that are similar. Trade profit was held back in the clustering process. Results show that clusters differ significantly in their profit and risk characteristics. Some clusters uncover "technical" trading rules. Using the information about the individual accounts, we describe the assignments of accounts to clusters by entropy, and model the transitions of a given account through clusters by a first order Markov model. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission records every transaction of the bond futures market. The comprehensiveness of this data as well as the maturing of technologies to process large amounts of information is enabling researchers to investigate many aspects of the futures market that were not possible before. In this study, we adopt a data-driven clustering approach to address the following questions: What trading styles and hidden regularities can statistical methods uncover in bond futures? Do we find evidence consistent with technical trading? How consistently do small traders adhere to one trading style? Can we model transitions from one style to another? What are the profit and risk characteristics for these styles? The goal of uncovering trading style through clustering implies that the basic unit of analysis has to be an individual trade. We define a trade to begin when an This study analyzes the transactions of the US Treasury bond futures September 1992 contract. We concentrate on non-exchange members trading off the floor (CTI type 4), who have no outstanding contracts at expiration and have executed at least 10 transactions. This filtering leaves us with a data set of 9271 trades, representing 1127 accounts. For a more detailed discussion of the data and variable selection process, see Chen et al. (1998a). The trades can be viewed as a set of unlabeled examples forming clusters in the space defined by our choice of trade-specific and market-specific variables. The goal is to find similar trades and categorize them as one cluster.
