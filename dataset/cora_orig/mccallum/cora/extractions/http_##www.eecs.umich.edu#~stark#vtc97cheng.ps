Abstract: In this paper we consider coding and modulation schemes for direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS-SS) systems with multiple-access (MA) interference in a fading environment. Our goal is to be able to adapt the code to different environments. Communication in an environment with a large amount of interference will require lower transmission (code) rate while small levels of interference will allow high rate transmission. In this paper the following coded modulation systems are considered: a conventional 64-ary orthogonal (M 64 ) code, the trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson (TCNR) code, and the trellis coded Reed-Muller (TCRM) code. Each of these is concatenated with a (63; k) Reed-Solomon (RS) outer code. The performance measure of interest is error probability and throughput. These are evaluated by making a Gaussian approximation on the multiple-access interference. Our results show, given an error probability requirement, and a certain data rate, a maximum number of users for each of the three DS-SS schemes can be determined. This indicates the receiver can adjust the coding and modulation scheme to achieve the given requirement.

Reference-contexts: Starting with this biorthogonal code, we can increase the number of codewords up to 256 by carefully adding selected cosets of the biorthogonal code to the original code, with the minimum distance slightly decreasing to 6. By doing so we get the nonlinear Nordstrom-Robinson (NR) code <ref> [2] </ref>. The 256 codewords are divided into 8 cosets, each of 32 biorthogonal codewords. The geometric uniformity property is satisfied with the NR code, although it is not linear. Since the demodulator under consideration is noncoherent, only the orthogonal subcode of the NR code can be used. <p> Simulation results [6] show that this approximation is pretty accurate when the number of users K is reasonably large. C. Trellis Coded Reed-Muller (TCRM) Code The original NR code with 256 codewords, is actually a subcode of second-order Reed-Muller code of length 16 (RM (2,4)) <ref> [2] </ref>. Moreover, in addition to the 8 cosets of the NR code, we can carefully add 8 more cosets to the NR code, which is also a subcode of the RM (2,4) code, with the minimum distance decreases to 4.

Reference-contexts: A fair comparison can be made between the TCNR code and the M 64 code since both have the same data rate. Previous work [1] <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that when SIR is high, the errors in the TCNR code occur asymptotically independently, and most errors happen within a 16-ary orthogonal signal set, i.e., within the same coset in the NR code. <p> Nevertheless, under the same channel condition and Gaussian assumption mentioned in Subsection II.A, the codeword error probability p e; T CNR and the bit error probability p b; TCNR can be obtained from simulation under Gaussian assumption. Simulation results <ref> [6] </ref> show that this approximation is pretty accurate when the number of users K is reasonably large. C.

Previous work <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that, similar to the TCNR code, the 16 cosets can be combined with a 16-state trellis to form a trellis coded Reed-Muller (TCRM) code, and a fair comparison can be made between the TCRM code, the M 64 code, and the TCNR code since all have the same

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, for a given number of users K and a given an error roof for P B , an optimal k, i.e., a maximum k, in the (63,k) RS code can be determined <ref> [7] </ref>. In Figure 3 we display the optimum number of information symbols in the Reed-Solomon code to maximize the code rate subject to the bit error probability being less than 0.01.
