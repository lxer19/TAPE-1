Abstract: A source characterization method which models the properties of a large number of sources is ideally required for the purposes of analysis. One approach for achieving such models for video sources is to identify basic components of video sources and video sequences and from these properties predict bit rates for these sources[7]. While this can lead to a universal source characterization framework, the basic components which need to be identified for modeling the source may not be readily available and may vary among different classes of coding algorithms. The parameters needed for such an approach may therefore not be easy to obtain. The other approach is to model video sources where the source coding is based on a standard algorithm which is exible enough to be applied to a multitude of video services, which is the approach taken in this paper. We study the output stream of a video coder, which complies with the Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) coding standard, with an NTSC quality video sequence as the input. Unlike previous works, we do not examine just bit rates per frame but also the manner in which these bits may arrive within the time period of a frame. This involves examining the bit generation process at the lowest level possible and then applying a packetization algorithm to generate ATM cells. Since the MPEG video coding algorithm has been proposed for a variety of applications, we also investigate the effect of changing some of the coding parameters on the statistics of interest. The outline of the paper is as follows; section 2 presents an overview of the MPEG coding algorithm including the modifications made for our real time application, section 3 discusses modeling issues for the MPEG video source and section 4 describes some of the statistical results obtained. Abstract In this paper we take a close look at the MPEG video coding standard for the transmission of variable bit rate video on ATM based Broadband ISDN. The MPEG standard has been defined for use in a variety of applications. Our focus in this paper is in its use for real time transmission of broadcast quality video. We were particularly interested in observing the impact of two key parameters, the intraframe to interframe picture ratio and the quantization index which are defined in the standard, on the bit rates per frame. These parameters may be used to control video sources depending on the state of the network. Also, as opposed to previous work which looks only at bit rates per frame, we study the bits generated per macroblock, the basic MPEG coding unit. By packetizing these bits, we obtain insights into the cell arrival process to a network for a MPEG video source. The transmission of variable bit rate video over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) has been the focus of much research recently. Several issues relating to the interaction of a video source and the network are still open topics[10]. The two major issues of interest are the effect of network parameters such as delay and loss on video service and the effect of high bit rate video sources on network performance.The detailed characterization of a single video source is an important first step in any effort to study these issues. One of the obstacles to such characterization has been the variety of techniques which can be used to encode video sequences. In addition, each type of video source, i.e. video telephone, video conference, broadcast television, usually needs to be characterized independently. The coding technique and the source from which the video sequence is obtained must therefore always be specified for a source characterization study to be meaningful.

Reference-contexts: An outline of the coding algorithm and structure is presented below with emphasis on the parameters and processes that are of interest in understanding the cell arrival process. For a fuller description of the MPEG coding standard and associated background information see <ref> [2] </ref>. The decision parameters for the compression algorithm (source coder) were obtained from the MPEG Video Simulation Model Three (SM3) report issued by Simulation Model Editorial group of the ISO-IEC working group.

Reference-contexts: For pure intraframe (N=1) or interframe (N=2592) coding, correlation between cells generated per frame exists for up to 300 frames. However the magnitude of the correlation is not large for frame lags greater than around 50 frames. In <ref> [4] </ref>, it was noted that a gamma distribution fits the empirical distribution of the number of cells generated per frame quite well for a variety of video conferencing sources. It was also hypothesized that the gamma distribution might be suitable for a variety of sources and coding algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The little that is known about this cell generation process for a variable bit rate video source is found in <ref> [5] </ref>. In this work, it was shown that the cell arrival process from a video source can have a complicated distribution. Most authors, however, have assumed, for the sake of convenience, arrival processes for video streams which will lead to queueing behavior that can be analyzed easily. <p> In general, they appear to be more complex distributions which may need to be modeled as a combination of distributions as observed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 5.0 Statistical Analysis The statistical properties of video coder bit streams are not well understood. Knowledge of these properties is essential for determining the best strategies for allocating resources for these types of services.

Reference-contexts: It can also be noticed that increasing q causes the shape of the pmf to become more one sided. This observation is somewhat similar to the observations in <ref> [9] </ref>, where it was shown that a lower resolution source, like video conferencing, had a skewed probability density function of bit rates when compared to a broadcast television source. within a frame.
