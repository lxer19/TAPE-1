Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Power diagrams <ref> [Aur87] </ref> are a useful generalization of Voronoi diagrams in which the sites defining the diagram are not points but balls.

Reference-contexts: Several algorithms and applications for the power diagrams are already known, including those referenced in <ref> [IIM85, Aur88] </ref>. Most recently power diagrams have played a key role in work related to alpha shapes and `skins' [Ede93, EM94, Ede95], as collections of balls are a natural model for molecular structures. The Voronoi diagram of point sites in any dimension has many useful proximity properties.

Reference-contexts: If we can continuously keep track of the closest pair of balls as the objects move, we will have a way to detect such collisions. This setting is examined in <ref> [BGZ97] </ref>, where a kinetic data structure ([BGH97]) is given for the case when all the balls have similar sizes. However, that method doesn't apply to the case when there is no bound on the ratio on the largest radius to the smallest radius.

Reference-contexts: They derive their name from the fact that the distance used in their definition is not the standard Euclidean distance, but instead the classical notion of the power of a point with respect to a ball <ref> [Cox61] </ref>. The advantage of the power distance is that the `bisector surfaces', the surfaces equidistant from two given balls, are hyper-planes, and thus the Euclidean structure of these diagrams is polyhedral and they are easier to compute and manipulate than standard Voronoi diagrams.
