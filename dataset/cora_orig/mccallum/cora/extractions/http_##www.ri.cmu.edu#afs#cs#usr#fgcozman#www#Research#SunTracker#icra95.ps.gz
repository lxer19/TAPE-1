Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of using Sun altitude for localization of a robot in totally unknown territory. A set of Sun altitudes is obtained by processing a sequence of time-indexed images of the sky. Each altitude constrains the viewer to a circle on the surface of a celestial body, called the circle of equal altitude. A set of circles of equal altitude can be intersected to yield viewer position. We use this principle to obtain position on Earth. Since altitude measurements are corrupted by noise, a least-square estimate is numerically calculated from the sequence of altitudes. The paper discusses the necessary theory for Sun-based localization, the technical issues of camera calibration and image processing, and presents preliminary results with real data.

Reference-contexts: The latitude of the GP of a body in the celestial sphere is denoted declination. The Sun maintains an almost constant declination on a given day. Sun declination varies slowly between +23 and 23 degrees, during a year. Sun declination is tabulated in the Astronomical Almanac <ref> [1] </ref> for every day of a given year. The longitude of the GP of the Sun, contrary to its declination, changes continuously during a day (since the Sun moves from East to West).

Reference-contexts: Three measurements are effected every time a pair altitude/GP is obtained: * An image is acquired. Camera parameters were obtained through a calibration method proposed by Robert [4]. The method generates the perspective projection matrix <ref> [2] </ref> which contains all the relevant information about the imaging system. * An angle is obtained through a digital inclinometer. We use a digital inclinometer with recalibration, but limited to 0:2 degrees of accu racy (reduced to 0:4 for large inclinations). * Greenwich Mean Time is stored.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This work addresses the problem of robot localization: how can a robot make precise measurements of position in totally unknown territory? We focus on the use of celestial cues in order to obtain localization. Techniques for celestial navigation are fundamental for any sea navigator <ref> [3] </ref>. Celestial information is also used in spacecraft and satellite applications for attitude control and accurate positioning [5]. Yet celestial navigation has not been heavily mentioned in connection to autonomous rovers. This comes as a surprise since planetary rovers will need reliable means of checking dead reckoning data. <p> We pursue an automatic solution of the localization problem. Instead of using a sextant to obtain the altitude of a celestial body, we use a camera and a digital inclinometer. The measurements are processed by a non-linear least-squares optimization that replaces the tables used by mariners <ref> [3] </ref>. We use measurements fl This research is supported in part by NASA under Grant NAGW-1175.

An extensive treatment is given by Hobbs <ref> [3] </ref>. We take position on Earth to be represented by a latitude/longitude pair. For calculations, we take south latitude as negative (zero at the equator) and west longitude as negative (zero at Greenwich). <p> The latter is measured with a digital inclinometer. Raw altitude is given by: h a = ff + fi where fi is the inclinometer reading. There are additional factors that must be taken into account in this type of measurement <ref> [3] </ref>. The gradual bending of an incoming light ray in the Earth's atmosphere is called atmospheric refraction; it must be corrected. Atmospheric refraction depends on the raw altitude, because rays bend in different ways when they reach the atmosphere at different angles. <p> The parallax correction (referred to as P A <ref> [3] </ref>) for the Sun is: The final observed altitude is h o = h a R + P A. 3.2 Obtaining GP of the Sun The astronomical position of the Sun is fixed for a given Greenwich Mean Time value.

Reference-contexts: The remaining solutions are the result of the whole procedure. 5 System Calibration The system is sensitive to errors due to miscalibra-tion. Three measurements are effected every time a pair altitude/GP is obtained: * An image is acquired. Camera parameters were obtained through a calibration method proposed by Robert <ref> [4] </ref>. The method generates the perspective projection matrix [2] which contains all the relevant information about the imaging system. * An angle is obtained through a digital inclinometer.

Reference-contexts: A grassfire transform is performed in order to destroy noisy features in the thresholded image. The grassfire transform is a fast algorithm for execution of morphological operations on images (for a discussion of this and other algorithms, see Xia's paper <ref> [6] </ref>). In a binary image, the grassfire transform calculates, for each pixel, the distance be sity Filters and Adjustable Platform tween the pixel and the background. In an image, background can be taken either as the "0" pixels or the "1" pixels.
