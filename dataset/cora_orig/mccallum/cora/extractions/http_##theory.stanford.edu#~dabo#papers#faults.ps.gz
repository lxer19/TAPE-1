Abstract: We present a theoretical model for breaking various cryptographic schemes by taking advantage of random hardware faults. We show how to attack certain implementations of RSA and Rabin signatures. An implementation of RSA based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be broken using a single erroneous signature. Other implementations can be broken using a larger number of erroneous signatures. We also analyze the vulnerability to hardware faults of two identification protocols: Fiat-Shamir and Schnorr. The Fiat-Shamir protocol can be broken after a small number of erroneous executions of the protocol. Schnorr's protocol can also be broken, but a larger number of erroneous executions is needed.

Reference-contexts: Induced faults When an adversary has physical access to a device she may try to purposely induce hardware faults. For instance, one may attempt to attack a tamper-resistant device by deliberately causing it to malfunction. See the informative discussion by Anderson and Kuhn <ref> [1] </ref> for more information on how to tamper with tamper resistant devices. We show that the erroneous cryptographic values computed by the device (e.g. erroneous RSA signatures) enable the adversary to extract the secret stored on it. We consider a fault model in which faults are transient.

Reference-contexts: Since the initial publication of our results several authors devised faults based attacks on other cryptographic systems. Biham and Shamir [5] presented elegant and novel attacks on DES. Some of their techniques can be used to recover the secret key of a totally unknown cipher. Anderson and Kuhn <ref> [2] </ref> used a different fault model to obtain powerful attacks. Bao et al. [3] devised fault attacks against DSS and several other signature schemes. Joye and Quisquater [12] noted that the CRT attacks (described in the next section) can also be mounted against several elliptic curve systems.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, our attack suggests that for security reasons devices must protect internal memory by adding some error detection bits (e.g. CRC). Another way to prevent our attack on RSA signatures is the use of random padding. See for instance the system suggested by Bellare and Rogaway <ref> [4] </ref>. In such schemes the signer appends random bits to the message to be signed. To verify the RSA signature the verifier raises the signature to the power of the public exponent and verifies that the message is indeed a part of the resulting value. <p> Such a result would significantly improve our Theorem 6.1. Another interesting question is whether an implementation of the Bellare-Rogaway signature scheme <ref> [4] </ref> based on RSA/CRT can be broken using a single erronous signature.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6 we show that hardware faults can be used to break other implementations of the RSA system though many more erroneous signatures are required. In Sections 4 and 5 we discuss the vulnerability of two identification schemes to hardware faults. For the Fiat-Shamir identification scheme <ref> [7] </ref> we show how a few erroneous executions of the protocol enable an adversary to completely recover the private key of the party trying to authenticate itself. Similar results hold for Schnorr's identification protocol [16] though a larger number of erroneous executions is necessary. <p> As before, all errors are transient and the hardware has no clue that the change has taken place. 4 The Fiat-Shamir identification scheme The Fiat-Shamir <ref> [7] </ref> identification scheme is an efficient method enabling one party, Alice, to authenticate it's identity to another party, Bob. They first agree on an n-bit modulus N which is a product of two large primes and a security parameter t.

Reference-contexts: CRC). We discuss these points in more detail at the end of the paper. We note that FIPS <ref> [8] </ref> publication 140-1 suggests that hardware faults may compromise the security of a module. Our results explicitly demonstrate the extent of damage caused by such faults. we give algorithms that show how certain faults can expose sensitive security information.

Reference-contexts: The idea of using hardware faults to attack cryptographic protocols applies to authentication schemes as well. For instance, we explained how the Fiat-Shamir and Schnorr identification protocols may be broken using hardware faults. The same applies to the Guillou-Quisquater identification scheme <ref> [10] </ref> though we do not give the details here. Verifying the computation and protecting internal storage using error detection bits defeats attacks based on hardware faults. We hope that this paper demonstrates that these measures are necessary for security reasons.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Direct attacks on the famous RSA cryptosystem seem to require that one factor the modulus. Therefore, it is interesting to ask whether there are attacks that avoid this. The answer is yes: the first was the recent attack based on timing <ref> [13] </ref>. It was observed that a few bits could be obtained from the time that operations took. This would allow one to break the system without factoring. We have a new type of attack that also avoids directly factoring the modulus.

Reference-contexts: It makes no difference what type of fault or how many faults occur in the computation of E 1 . All we rely on is the fact that faults occur in the computation modulo only one of the primes. Arjen Lenstra <ref> [14] </ref> observed that one faulty signature of a known message M is sufficient. For completeness we describe Lenstra's improvement here. Let E = M s mod N .

Reference-contexts: We assume that the probability of such faults is small so that only a small number of them occur during the computation. Our attack is effective against several cryptographic schemes such as the RSA system and Rabin signatures <ref> [15] </ref> as well as several identification schemes. As expected, the effectiveness of the attack depends on the exact implementation of each of these schemes. <p> Lenstra's improvement shows that as long as the entire signed message is known, even such RSA/CRT systems are vulnerable to the hardware faults attack. The attack on Chinese remainder theorem implementations applies to other cryptosystems as well. For instance, the same attack applies to Rabin's signature scheme <ref> [15] </ref>. A Rabin signature of a number x mod N is the modular square root of x.

Reference-contexts: For the Fiat-Shamir identification scheme [7] we show how a few erroneous executions of the protocol enable an adversary to completely recover the private key of the party trying to authenticate itself. Similar results hold for Schnorr's identification protocol <ref> [16] </ref> though a larger number of erroneous executions is necessary. Both attacks use faults that corrupt the prover while waiting for a challenge from the verifier. <p> Once Bob has a method for computing r he can recover the secrets s 1 ; : : : ; s t as discussed in the previous section. 5 Attacking Schnorr's identification scheme The security of Schnorr's identification scheme <ref> [16] </ref> is based on the hardness of computing discrete log modulo a prime. Alice and Bob first agree on a prime p and a generator g of ZZ fl p . Alice chooses a secret integer s and publishes y = g s mod p as her public key.

Reference-contexts: In other systems verification appears to be costly (e.g. DSS). Due to the extreme vulnerability of RSA/CRT checking appears to be necessary whenever it is used. This is especially true for Certification Authorities where a single transient fault could leak the private key. Recently Shamir <ref> [17] </ref> presented an ingenious method for verifying signatures generated by the RSA/CRT method. When the public exponent e is small (e.g. 3) standard verification (i.e. raising the signature to the power of e) is still the best way to go.
