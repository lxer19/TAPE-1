Title: Exploiting Plan Reasoning to Generate Effective Task Descriptions

Abstract: The task of generating effective textual descriptions of the plans produced by automatic planning algorithms is made more difficult by the complexity of the plans themselves. Describing every component of a complicated plan makes for an awkward and ineffective description. Previous work on the generation of instructional text from plans has not addressed the issue of the generation of concise and effective plan descriptions. The work I propose focuses on the development of domain-independent techniques to eliminate the complexity from these textual descriptions. I propose several techniques that exploit the plan reasoning capabilities of users and the task context in which plan descriptions occur to produce effective and concise descriptions.

Reference-contexts: Computational models of this type of reasoning prove useful when determining the constraints an effective plan description should contain. Background: Planning As Refinement Search Research in AI plan generation has been heavily influenced by the development of simple algorithms for partial-order, causal link (POCL) planning, no tably TWEAK <ref> (Chapman 1987) </ref>, SNLP (McAllister & Rosenblitt 1991) and UCPOP (Penberthy & Weld 1991). POCL-style planners are typically characterized as performing refinement search (Kambhampati 1993) through a space of partial plans.

Reference-contexts: The criteria I provide above only set a lower bound on the amount of constraints that appear in a description. They leave unspecified an upper bound and make no suggestion about the structure of the partial plan the constraints form. Related work by Dale and Reiter <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1995) </ref> describe four interpretations of Grice's maxims for systems generating object descriptions and discuss the computational properties of four corresponding algorithms.

Reference-contexts: These negative constraints, prohibitions against the occurrence of specific constraints in a plan, are typically found in task-related discourse in the form of negative imperatives <ref> (Di Eugenio 1993) </ref> and other constraint-related prohibitions. Motivated by principles similar to Joshi's revised maxim of quality (Joshi 1982), a speaker that anticipates the potential unwanted inferences that a hearer may draw about the structure of a plan can include negative instructions in a description to prevent these implicatures.

Reference-contexts: To identify a plan effectively, some technique for conveying information about the plan must be found that communicates less than the plan's full structure. Grice <ref> (Grice 1975) </ref> uses the expression conversational implicature to describe a type of inference that can be drawn based not only on what is said but also on the greater context in which the conversation occurs.

Reference-contexts: POCL-style planners are typically characterized as performing refinement search <ref> (Kambhampati 1993) </ref> through a space of partial plans. In this model, each node in the search space is defined by a partial plan and denotes the node's candidate set, the class of all legal completions of the partial plan at that node.

Reference-contexts: approaches have either described plans produced by simplified planning models designed specifically for text generation (Vander Linden 1993; Delin et al. 1994) or have used plans produced by automatic planning systems and consequently generated descriptions that were unnatural and ineffective due to the amount of detail contained in the plans <ref> (Mellish & Evans 1989) </ref>. In this paper I outline a technique for the generation of concise and effective plan descriptions that exploits a model of the task and the plan-space characteristics of the planning process in order to leave implicit much of the required detail in a plan description. <p> Conversational Implicature While the explicit communication of the complete structure of a plan is not a problem between computational agents whose communication channels are comparable in bandwidth even to the simplest of today's networks, describing a plan to human agents in this manner is unnatural <ref> (Mellish & Evans 1989) </ref>. To identify a plan effectively, some technique for conveying information about the plan must be found that communicates less than the plan's full structure. <p> A complete plan for this situation is shown in figure 1. A complete description of this plan, similar in detail to plan descriptions produced by Mellish and Evans <ref> (Mellish & Evans 1989) </ref>, is: Description 2 R takes the bus. In order for R to be at work at the final state, use the effect of R taking the bus. R and M talk.

Reference-contexts: The work described in this paper applies in general to planners characterized as performing refinement search; for illustration I will use plans generated by the DPOCL planning algorithm <ref> (Young, Pollack, & Moore 1994) </ref> as the underlying action representation. DPOCL is a hierarchical planner that incorporates action decomposition directly into the POCL framework.
