Abstract: With long-lived multi-party connections, resource allocation subsystems in distributed real-time systems or communication networks must be aware of dynamically changing network load in order to reduce call-blocking probabilities. We describe a distributed mechanism to dynamically reallocate ("migrate") resources without adversely affecting the performance that established connections receive. In addition to allowing systems to dynamically adapt to load, this mechanism allows for distributed relaxation of resources (i.e. the adjustment of overallocation of resources due to conservative assumptions at connection establishment time) for multicast connections. We describe how dynamic resource migration is incorporated in the Tenet Scheme 2 protocols for multiparty real-time communication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The increasing speed of computer networks and the improvement of workstation capabilities are enabling a new class of distributed applications, those involving multimedia data. It is widely believed that these applications should be supported in the general framework of real-time communication <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>, which provides predictable performance (e.g., end-to-end delay bounds for data delivery); typically, the clients negotiate with the network service provider to obtain a desired Quality of Service (QoS), which the provider guarantees. <p> A number of schemes and protocols have been proposed to provide real-time communication services. Most of the schemes are connection-oriented, and reserve resources (bandwidth, buffers, and so on) along the route of a real-time connection <ref> [1, 2, 7] </ref>. QoS guarantees cannot be provided if the network does not check for saturation before accepting new channels. Thus, the network must perform admission control to ensure that the guarantees are met.

Our previous paper [10] describes the relevant aspects of Tenet; in this discussion, we limit ourselves to discussing a few of its salient features. <p> In this manner, the target sets support the decoupling between the senders and the receivers and also provide the rendezvous among them. 4 Traditional real-time network systems (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>) treat traffic on different connec-tions independently when determining their resource requirements. For multi-party real-time communication, this results in inefficient over-allocation of resources [12]. For example, consider an audio-conference of one hundred persons.

Reference-contexts: The signalling protocol then determines the end-to-end performance provided at the current allocation levels; if this exceeds the performance bounds requested by the clients, the signalling protocol can, in the second pass (called relaxation pass), inform the LRM to reduce (relax) the resource allocations <ref> [8, 10] </ref> appropriately. This is the approach that the Tenet protocols have taken [8]. With the first approach, the resource allocation decisions for a channel are oblivious of the channel's end-to-end performance bounds. <p> This is the approach that the Tenet protocols have taken <ref> [8] </ref>. With the first approach, the resource allocation decisions for a channel are oblivious of the channel's end-to-end performance bounds. This may lead to inefficiencies in resource allocations, as well as the network not meeting the end-to-end performance bounds.

Reference-contexts: For services that provide bounds on end-to-end delay, at least three distinct approaches are possible: * The LRM allocates resources based on the current workload. The amount of resources allocated does not depend on the end-to-end performance parameters that the client requires. This is the approach that RSVP takes <ref> [9] </ref>. * The LRM provides, to the signalling protocol, a range of feasible resource allocations; in a separate pass, the signalling protocol chooses the final resource allocation. This is the approach followed in OPWA [11]. * In a first pass, the LRM makes a tentative resource allocation.

One approach <ref> [11] </ref> is to insist that the information be provided as a function of a set of parameters (e.g., that the local delay bound will be of the form a + b x , where a and b are provided by the LRM, which also provides bounds for values of x).

Reference-contexts: For multi-party real-time communication, this results in inefficient over-allocation of resources <ref> [12] </ref>. For example, consider an audio-conference of one hundred persons. In the strawman proposal, the conference is set up by establishing one hundred multicast channels, one from each speaker (sender) to all listeners (destinations). It is reasonable to expect that only one person speaks at any time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the resource allocation can be reduced (and the allocation efficiency increases) if the network clients can specify these resource sharing properties to the network and if the network can use such information to reduce the resource allocation along common sub-paths. The Tenet Scheme 2 provides channels groups <ref> [13] </ref>; the resource sharing channel groups allow the network clients to specify these resource sharing relationships to the network. In the above example, the application would: (a) create a new channel group, and (b) inform the network to include the hundred audio channels in this channel group.

Reference-contexts: In order to be efficient, and to reduce the granularity of change to which such a scheme can adapt, the renegotiations must be light-weight. Thus, the number of nodes involved in a renegotiation must be kept small. An example of the opposite approach is Dynamic Channel Management (DCM) <ref> [14] </ref>, where the renegotiation consists of a re-establishment of the entire channel. Although particular attention is given in this scheme to minimizing transient over-allocation of resources during the re-establishment process, DCM is not easily scalable, in particular for multicast channels.

Reference-contexts: In addition, dynamic resource reallocation does not affect the QoS guarantees provided to the receivers. In the following, we describe the steps involved in resource renegotiation. For sake of simplicity of argument, we will assume a rate-controlled fixed-priority (RCSP) scheduling discipline <ref> [15] </ref> on all the nodes. With the appropriate modifications, the description below is valid for other scheduling disciplines as well, such as jitter-controlled earliest-deadline-first (J-EDD) [16], stop-and-go [17], hierarchical round robin [18], and combinations thereof. <p> The value of d i depends on the scheduling algorithm used, and is typically determined by time-demand analysis. The amount of buffer space that must be allocated for C at node N i is defined by <ref> [15] </ref>: B i = d i1 ' & X min P ; where X min and P are the worst-case packet inter-arrival time and worst-case packet length, respectively. In the following, we describe the reallocation process in detail.
