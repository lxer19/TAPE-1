Abstract: We provide a tight analysis of Grover's algorithm for quantum database searching. We give a simple closed-form formula for the probability of success after any given number of iterations of the algorithm. This allows us to determine the number of iterations necessary to achieve almost certainty of finding the answer. Furthermore, we analyze the behaviour of the algorithm when the element to be found appears more than once in the table and we provide a new algorithm to find such an element even when the number of solutions is not known ahead of time. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the efficiency of any possible quantum database searching algorithm and we show that Grover's algorithm comes within 2.62% of being optimal. ?

Reference-contexts: Throughout this paper we assume for simplicity that each evaluation of F takes unit time. Grover <ref> [1] </ref> has discovered an algorithm for the quantum computer that can solve this problem in expected time in O ( p N ), provided there is a unique solution. <p> The heart of Grover's algorithm is the iteration described in the previous section. A simple calculation|see Grover's original article <ref> [1] </ref> for details| shows that each iteration efficiently transforms j (k; `)i into fi fi N2 2 (N1) N ` 2 jE It follows that the j-th iteration produces state j j i = j (k j ; ` j )i where k j+1 = N2 2 (N1) N ` j <p> It is sufficient to perform half this number of iterations, approximately 8 N , if we are satisfied with a 50% probability of success, as Grover considered in his original paper <ref> [1] </ref>. We shall prove in Section 7 that this is optimal within a few percent because any quantum algorithm that solves the search problem with a 50% probability of success must evaluate F at least (sin 8 ) N times and 8 1:026 sin 8 . <p> We are interested in finding an arbitrary solution. Grover briefly considers this problem <ref> [1] </ref>, but he provides no details concerning the efficiency of his method. We assume in this section that the number t of solutions is known and that it is not zero. Let A = fi j F (i) = 1g and B = fi j F (i) = 0g. <p> claim in a time in O ( p N ) that there are no solutions when this is the case, with an arbitrarily small probability of failure when in fact there is a solution. 2 7 An Improved Lower Bound Drawing on general results from [2], Grover points out in <ref> [1] </ref> that any algorithm for quantum database searching must take a time at least proportional to p to succeed with nonnegligible probability when there is a unique solution.

Reference-contexts: Grover [1] has discovered an algorithm for the quantum computer that can solve this problem in expected time in O ( p N ), provided there is a unique solution. He also remarked that a result in <ref> [2] </ref> implies that his algorithm is optimal, up to an unspecified multiplicative constant, among all possible quantum algorithms. In this paper we provide a tight analysis of Grover's algorithm. In particular we give a simple closed-form formula for the probability of success after any given number of iterations. <p> We also generalize Grover's algorithm to the case N is not a power of 2. Finally, we refine the argument of <ref> [2] </ref> to show that Grover's algorithm is within 2.62% of being optimal. To motivate this work, here are three simple applications for Grover's algorithm. Assume you have a large table T [0 : : N 1] in which you would like to find some element y. <p> In this case Grover's algorithm solves the problem in a time in O (2 n=2 ), which is better than the time in O (2 n ) required by the obvious classical algorithm, but not good enough to imply that NP BQP <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Overview of Grover's Algorithm Grover's algorithm consists of an initialization followed by a number of identical iterations, a final measurement, and a classical test. <p> algorithm, which allows us to claim in a time in O ( p N ) that there are no solutions when this is the case, with an arbitrarily small probability of failure when in fact there is a solution. 2 7 An Improved Lower Bound Drawing on general results from <ref> [2] </ref>, Grover points out in [1] that any algorithm for quantum database searching must take a time at least proportional to p to succeed with nonnegligible probability when there is a unique solution.

Reference-contexts: An exciting cryptographic application is that Grover's algorithm can be used to crack the widely used Data Encryption Standard (des) <ref> [3] </ref> under a known plaintext attack. Given a matching pair (m; c) of plaintext and ciphertext, consider function F : f0; 1g 56 ! f0; 1g defined by F (k) = 1 if and only if des k (m) = c.

Reference-contexts: Provided there is a unique solution, the required key k can be found after roughly 185 million expected calls to a quantum des device <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus quantum computing makes single-key des totally insecure. For yet another application, consider a Boolean formula 2 on n variables. You would like to determine if the formula is satisfiable.

Reference-contexts: You would like to determine if the formula is satisfiable. There may exist an efficient classical algorithm for this problem but none are known. (This is equivalent to the famous P ? = NP open question in theoretical computer science <ref> [5] </ref>).
