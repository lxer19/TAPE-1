Abstract: The complexity of managing and controlling large heterogeneous networks requires the availability of management stations equipped with sophisticated tools. A fundamental feature of an advanced network management station is the capability to present to the human manager a comprehensible picture of the relevant scenarios. The tools present at the station must allow the manager specify management functionalities in a graceful manner. But the overwhelming volume and complexity of the information involved in network management poses a major challenge. In this paper we show how the Hy + visual database system fulfills the information presentation and specification requirements of advanced network management stations. A visual database system is capable of manipulating data visualizations through visually expressed queries. The Hy + system provides a uniform framework for hygraph based data visualizations, queries, and their results. Visual queries, expressed in the GraphLog language, are interpreted as patterns that match existing visualizations and create new ones. A prime example of the functionality supported by the system consists of describing a query that filters a large visualization to retain the portion that is of interest for the network manager in the context of a particular task. Examples of data visualizations that are relevant for network management are the network topology at different levels of abstraction, the presentation of network configuration information, and the display of management information bases and their history traces. Employing a fault management scenario as motivation, we demonstrate how the Hy + system deals with all of the above visualizations and several of their combinations, as well as entirely new ones generated through ad-hoc visual queries. With the aid of this system a network manager can also specify network management functionalities as declarative GraphLog queries, for example, define alerts.

Reference-contexts: If the condition is satisfied, an edge called problem-area is created from the node labeled samba to the node labeled with the name of the alert. The queries define82 and define83 should be interpreted as two (active database) rules (see <ref> [Day88, BM91, Cer92] </ref>) that are triggered on non-empty retrieval events and perform the action of adding the distinguished edges. These queries defining an alert shows how relevant network 11 management functions can be specified as declarative GraphLog queries.

Reference-contexts: Defining potential problem symptoms is very difficult without a priori knowledge of the behavior of the network. Symptoms can be defined in terms of statistics or the expected behavior of the network. In <ref> [GL91] </ref>, it is observed that a temporal cycle exists in the traffic distribution of a network. Therefore, a suitable approach consists of defining problem symptoms in terms of traffic patterns. For example, during high traffic periods, it is natural that network accesses are slowed down. <p> Current SNMP TCP MIB variables do not provide us with traffic information on a per TCP link basis. However, given SNMP's widespread usage and simplicity, we will use SNMP MIB objects in our example. Traffic patterns can also be established using the procedure mentioned in <ref> [GL91] </ref>. The traffic information between two subnets (dbnet and distnet) taken from the example network in Figure 3) is shown against the topology map in Figure 8 The server samba located in the subnet dbnet is accessed by clients, in the same as well as in other subnets.

Our first hypothesis is that the cause is congestion at nearby gateways (routers).
