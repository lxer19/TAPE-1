Abstract: Technical Report #1130 December 1992 Abstract To date, the overwhelming use of motion in computational vision has been to recover the three-dimensional structure of the scene. We propose that there are other, more powerful, uses for motion. Toward this end, we define dynamic perceptual organization as an extension of the traditional (static) perceptual organization approach. Just as static perceptual organization groups coherent features in an image, dynamic perceptual organization groups coherent motions through an image sequence. Using dynamic perceptual organization, we propose a new paradigm for motion understanding and show why it can be done independently of the recovery of scene structure and scene motion. The paradigm starts with a spatiotemporal cube of image data and organizes the paths of points so that interactions between the paths and perceptual motions such as common, relative and cyclic are made explicit. The results of this can then be used for high-level motion recognition tasks.

Reference-contexts: Scene motion computes the motion of points in world coordinates. Only after the objects are recognized are the scene dynamics analyzed by using the scene motion to compute what, if any, high-level motion the objects are undergoing (e.g., walking by a human) <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>. This paradigm, which is the Marr approach with motion aspects emphasized, is shown in Figure 1. Note that the recognition of object motion is computed last. <p> The four categories are: low-level structure, high-level structure, low-level motion and high-level motion. Low-level structure consists primarily of work that recovers 3D scene structure of rigid parts from image sequences (e.g., structure from motion). High-level structure has dealt with recovering and representing articulated objects <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>. However, given some object in an image sequence, all these articulated object representations are better suited to match the scene structure with a model rather than match the image motion or scene motion with a model. <p> Most of the work that might be 6 considered to address this issue is actually recovering high-level structure and not modelling how objects move in order to recognize their motion <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Specific perceptually-salient features are then detected from groups of flow curves. These perceptual features include, but are not limited to: interactive motion between groups (e.g, occlusion and disocclusion), cyclic motion, and common and relative motion. cube, which we call the spatiotemporal surface flow <ref> [Allm90a] </ref>. This is the lowest level in our hierarchy. The next step is to organize the instantaneous motion of points into the long-range motion of each point through the ST cube up to the most recent frame. <p> The temporal component of a vector indicates the speed, as the speed approaches 0, t approaches 1, and as the speed approaches infinity, t approaches 0. ST surface flow can be computed as shown in <ref> [Allm90a] </ref> or traditional optical flow fields can be converted into ST surface flow fields. Vectors in an optical flow fields are typically two-dimensional, V = (x; y), with x and y indicating the direction of motion and 9 the length, kVk, indicating the speed. <p> In particular, the computation of the instantaneous motion of points in an ST cube is presented, followed by the recovery and grouping of ST flow curves. Results such as these can then be used for further computations such as the computation of relative and common motion.

Reference-contexts: From these groups even higher-level spatiotemporal structures can be organized. For example, spatiotemporal interaction between two groups of ST flow curves implies occlusion and disocclusion is occurring [Allm91b]. Periodic flow curves indicate cyclic motion (common among ambulatory objects) <ref> [Allm90b] </ref>. In addition, the ST flow curves in a group can be decomposed into the relative motion and common motion of the points. <p> Sections 3.3 and 3.4 discuss the importance of relative and common motion, and why they are necessary. The importance of cyclic motion will not be discussed further in this paper since it has been described elsewhere <ref> [Allm90b] </ref>. Briefly, it is a significant generic spatiotemporal feature because it is characteristic of many natural objects and their motions. <p> We showed promising results for the early levels of our approach, indicating that the computation of spatiotemporal features and their relations is an important and well-defined step. These results and other work on cyclic motion detection <ref> [Allm90b] </ref> show that it is possible to organize the motion through an image sequence independently of scene structure and scene motion. Future work will continue to explore the full potential of this dynamic perceptual organization paradigm. 26

Reference-contexts: A small number of researchers have argued that it is possible to recognize an object and its high-level motion without first recovering its high-level geometric structure <ref> [Pola92, Yama92, Allm91a, Goul89, Godd88] </ref>. The image-sequence motion of a few representative points rather than the low-level structure, e.g., rigidity, can be used to recognize an object [Goul89]. Most of these approaches require high-level models that are rich in temporal information [Godd88].

Reference-contexts: As additional images become available, the paths of points are extended into the new frames. An ST curve through an ST cube such that the tangent vector at a point on the curve equals the ST surface flow at that point is called a spatiotemporal flow curve <ref> [Allm91b] </ref>. This is the next level in our hierarchy. Similarly shaped ST flow curves are then organized into groups so that each group represents a single coherent motion such as translation or rotation. From these groups even higher-level spatiotemporal structures can be organized. <p> From these groups even higher-level spatiotemporal structures can be organized. For example, spatiotemporal interaction between two groups of ST flow curves implies occlusion and disocclusion is occurring <ref> [Allm91b] </ref>. Periodic flow curves indicate cyclic motion (common among ambulatory objects) [Allm90b]. In addition, the ST flow curves in a group can be decomposed into the relative motion and common motion of the points. <p> Further, similarly shaped ST flow curves, i.e., curves with similar curvature and slope, can be organized into groups using standard clustering techniques and interactions between flow curves (Interactive Motion in Figure 3) can be detected and interpreted. (It was argued by Allmen and Dyer <ref> [Allm91b] </ref> that torsion is not necessary to distinguish between different types of motion.) Specifically, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to initially cluster the flow curves. Each resulting group then represents a single coherent motion. <p> From these groups of ST flow curves, separate moving objects can be hypothesized, and occlusion and disocclusion between them can be identified by examining how groups merge and split <ref> [Allm91b] </ref>. Results of this process are shown in Section 5. Using the groups of ST flow curves, we can now organize the motion into higher-level representations such as the common and relative motion within and between these groups of ST flow curves. <p> Results such as these can then be used for further computations such as the computation of relative and common motion.

Reference-contexts: This is guaranteed to be the case because p 1 (i) specifies only one scene configuration. Perhaps even more important than being unnecessary, the recovery of scene structure 20 and scene motion is also undesirable. This is because the process, even when well-posed, is unstable because of non-linear constraints <ref> [Aloi88] </ref>. In practice, since ST flow curves are noisy, using them or any recovered image motion representation will result in very noisy computed scene structure and scene motion. Therefore, rather than use this unstable process, we believe it should be avoided altogether. <p> Therefore, rather than use this unstable process, we believe it should be avoided altogether. It is possible to avoid it because the image-sequence motion uniquely represents the scene. Alternatively, one could use an "active observer" approach and make the problem stable <ref> [Aloi88] </ref>, but, again, this is unnecessary for the reasons stated above. 5 Results In this section we show computational results for the first steps of our dynamic perceptual organization approach.

Reference-contexts: The novel aspect of this work is that motion recognition is performed prior to object recognition and prior to recovery of scene structure, and does not require recovery of scene motion. Aloimonos <ref> [Aloi90] </ref> made a similar point, that scene structure is not necessarily needed in order to perform certain visual tasks.

Reference-contexts: The most novel aspect of the dynamic perceptual organization paradigm is that scene structure and scene motion are not recovered. In this section we briefly review the work of Ullman [Ullm79], Hoffman and Flinchbaugh [Hoff82], and Bennett and Hoffman <ref> [Benn85] </ref> to show the assumptions necessary to recover structure from motion. Given these assumptions about the scene, the image-sequence motion uniquely represents the scene motion. <p> Thus it is possible to explain the HVS's performance with MLDs if we believe that the HVS exploits the planarity assumption. Bennett and Hoffman <ref> [Benn85] </ref> made even stronger statements about recovering scene structure.

Reference-contexts: In order to prevent the two types of throwing from being equivalent, relative spatial information must be incorporated. Cutting showed that relative spatial information is a necessary component of MLDs in order for the HVS to perceive walking <ref> [Cutt81a] </ref>. He presented subjects with a spatially anomalous "walking" MLD, where the initial positions of the lights were altered while keeping their individual absolute motions correct. None of the subjects detected the walking motion.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the ST flow curves in a group can be decomposed into the relative motion and common motion of the points. These two motions are equivalent to the relative and common motions that are observable by the human visual system <ref> [Cutt82] </ref>. 8 As stated above, this hierarchy includes only bottom-up, i.e., non model-based, aspects. <p> The cycloidal absolute motion is generally not perceived. Even though the absolute cycloidal motion is not perceived, the following equation 13 the rim of a rolling wheel. holds <ref> [Cutt82] </ref>: common motion + relative motion = absolute motion (2) For example, we can show how this equation holds for a rolling wheel. <p> Therefore, how the HVS perceives these motions can be used to derive additional constraints to solve Eq. (2).

Reference-contexts: The motion of a few points attached to a walking human will usually require a relatively long temporal sequence ("one or two steps" as observed by Johansson <ref> [Joha73] </ref>). Because the necessary interval of time to organize the data is scene dependent, it is important to analyze long image sequences (i.e., on the order of hundreds of frames) in order to handle all situations. <p> This is consistent with psychophysical evidence using moving light displays <ref> [Joha73] </ref>. Historically, image motion has been used in two main ways: (1) to recover structure in the 3D scene, and (2) to recover instantaneous motion in the scene. Scene structure is often represented as the 2 1 2 -D sketch or intrinsic images. <p> Note that this figure is organized with structure on the left and motion on the right. perceptual organization paradigm alone is sufficient for recognition as shown by the human visual system's ability to recognize certain objects and their motion <ref> [Joha73] </ref>. Also, in cases where depth information is unavailable and perceptual organization of static image features is ambiguous, grouping dynamic features based on their spatiotemporal characteristics can be used for recognizing generic high-level motions such as rolling and swinging. <p> Johansson's moving light displays (MLDs) are image sequences containing the motion of a few points of light, produced, for example, by attaching lights to the joints of a person walking in the dark <ref> [Joha73] </ref>. Because each image consists of a few random points of light containing no structure, the perceptual organization of these points and the recognition of the objects is strictly due to the relations between the spatiotemporal curves swept out by the lights. Johansson [Joha73] used MLDs consisting of ten lights to <p> of a person walking in the dark <ref> [Joha73] </ref>. Because each image consists of a few random points of light containing no structure, the perceptual organization of these points and the recognition of the objects is strictly due to the relations between the spatiotemporal curves swept out by the lights. Johansson [Joha73] used MLDs consisting of ten lights to examine human performance at interpreting articulated objects. MLDs were used so that only point motion information at the joints was available. In the first demonstration, adults watched an MLD of human walking, as viewed from the side of the walker. <p> Therefore, how the HVS perceives these motions can be used to derive additional constraints to solve Eq.

Reference-contexts: Rather than focus on recovering quantitative "maps" of intrinsic 3D structure, an alternative approach is to emphasize the goal of perceptual organization, i.e., discovering primitive image relations that group sets of image features into relevant structures <ref> [Witk83b, Lowe83, Lowe85] </ref>. The key organizing principle is to find relations that are unlikely to have occurred by accident. For example, proximity, collinearity and parallelism have been used for organizing spatial data [Lowe85].

Reference-contexts: The structure could not have been used since the person's structure remained unchanged between displays; it was the motion of the person that varied with the weight of the box. Other studies <ref> [Cutt81b, MacA83] </ref> found evidence that adults are capable of recognizing friends and the gender of a person from only the joint motions in MLDs.

Reference-contexts: Scene motion computes the motion of points in world coordinates. Only after the objects are recognized are the scene dynamics analyzed by using the scene motion to compute what, if any, high-level motion the objects are undergoing (e.g., walking by a human) <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>. This paradigm, which is the Marr approach with motion aspects emphasized, is shown in Figure 1. Note that the recognition of object motion is computed last. <p> The four categories are: low-level structure, high-level structure, low-level motion and high-level motion. Low-level structure consists primarily of work that recovers 3D scene structure of rigid parts from image sequences (e.g., structure from motion). High-level structure has dealt with recovering and representing articulated objects <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>. However, given some object in an image sequence, all these articulated object representations are better suited to match the scene structure with a model rather than match the image motion or scene motion with a model. <p> Most of the work that might be 6 considered to address this issue is actually recovering high-level structure and not modelling how objects move in order to recognize their motion <ref> [Marr80, Hogg83, Akit84] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We propose that motion should be perceptually organized in a hierarchical representation. We will construct this hierarchy non-purposively, i.e., without depending on high-level models, analogous to the way Marr developed the primal sketch and 2 1 2 sketch <ref> [Marr82] </ref>. image sequence data is given as a three-dimensional spatiotemporal (ST) volume, i.e., an image plane fi time cube of pixels, and the fixed temporal depth of the cube provides a moving temporal window into the infinite "stream" of images.

Reference-contexts: A small number of researchers have argued that it is possible to recognize an object and its high-level motion without first recovering its high-level geometric structure <ref> [Pola92, Yama92, Allm91a, Goul89, Godd88] </ref>. The image-sequence motion of a few representative points rather than the low-level structure, e.g., rigidity, can be used to recognize an object [Goul89]. Most of these approaches require high-level models that are rich in temporal information [Godd88].

Reference-contexts: However, since F is only defined at coordinate points and must be interpolated at intermediate pixels, the relatively simple Runge-Kutta method <ref> [Pres88, Gear71] </ref> is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: The results with this display were similar to the results in the first demonstration. Johansson also tested displays for running, cycling, climbing, dancing in couples, various types of gymnastic motion, and others. In all cases adults correctly identified the motion. Runeson <ref> [Rune81] </ref> made MLDs that had points of light not only on the joints of a person but also at the corners of a box that the person was lifting. Observers of this MLD were able to recognize and judge the weight of the box.

Reference-contexts: Spelke also showed the importance of motion on object recognition, observing that young infants fail to recognize objects based on static configurational properties, but do apprehend objects by analyzing the motion of cohesive, bounded and spatiotemporally-continuous surfaces <ref> [Spel90] </ref>. Related work on computational visual motion can be classified into four categories according to the type of information recovered from an image sequence. The four categories are: low-level structure, high-level structure, low-level motion and high-level motion.

Reference-contexts: The most novel aspect of the dynamic perceptual organization paradigm is that scene structure and scene motion are not recovered. In this section we briefly review the work of Ullman <ref> [Ullm79] </ref>, Hoffman and Flinchbaugh [Hoff82], and Bennett and Hoffman [Benn85] to show the assumptions necessary to recover structure from motion. Given these assumptions about the scene, the image-sequence motion uniquely represents the scene motion. <p> The rigidity assumption states that any set of elements undergoing a spatiotemporal transformation and that has a unique interpretation as a rigid body moving in the scene, should be interpreted as such a body in motion. Ullman <ref> [Ullm79] </ref> used this assumption to show: Given three distinct orthographic views of four non-coplanar points in a rigid con figuration, the structure and motion compatible with the three views is uniquely determined up to a reflection about the image plane.

Reference-contexts: There are no "correct" solutions to Eq. (2), only solutions that are similar to the HVS's perception. Therefore, how the HVS perceives these motions can be used to derive additional constraints to solve Eq. (2). Psychologists have long recognized this perceptual phenomenon <ref> [Joha50, Hoch57, Wall65] </ref>, but have failed to develop a complete model of how the HVS computes relative and common motion [Joha73, Cutt82]. One commonality in those models is to minimize the total com 15 plexity of the relative and/or common motions [Hoch53, Hoch60, Cutt82].

While Witkin and Tenenbaum suggested using the manner in which objects move as an organizing criterion <ref> [Witk83a] </ref>, motion properties have not been used to their full potential in this respect. As objects and contours move in the scene (i.e., undergo scene motion), their projections into the image also move, generating image or spatiotemporal motion. Over time, these projections sweep out spatiotemporal volumes, surfaces and curves.
