Reference-contexts: 1 CONVENTIONS This document type definition (abbreviated DTD) was developed using DTDSPIN <ref> [2] </ref>. Specific typographical conventions used in DTDSPIN generated DTD's are explained below. The conventions will be used throughout the manuscript; it is essential they are well understood.

Reference-contexts: The DTD encompasses a large number of document types, including articles, recordings, books, and technical reports, to mention a few. The DTD is based on a bipartite model for bibliographic DTD's described in a separate paper <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.1 Character Entities The following ISO standard character entities are used in mathematical and technical writing.

Reference-contexts: An element is referred to in prose using its start tag &lt;lhs&gt;. A tag with empty content contains a right hand side of . Attributes follow a vertical bar directly below the element. The attribute definition is similar in form to a SGML attribute definiton <ref> [5] </ref>. The ! symbol suggests a rule in a context-free grammar. The = symbol (used below) assigns a name to an expression. A DTDSPIN sequence (s.lhs below) is an ordered list of elements forming a content model. <p> The DTD is based on a bipartite model for bibliographic DTD's described in a separate paper [3]. 2.1 Character Entities The following ISO standard character entities are used in mathematical and technical writing.
