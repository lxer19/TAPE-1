Abstract: In control theory, the usual notion of causality|that, at all times, a system's output (action) only depends on its past and present inputs (observations)|presupposes that all inputs and outputs can be ordered, a priori, in time. Many distributed systems (those subject to deadlock, for instance) are not sequential in this sense. In this paper we explore the relationship between a less restrictive notion of causality and the properties of a potentially non-sequential generic stochastic control problem formulated within the framework of Witsen-hausen's intrinsic model. Specifically, the generic problem is defined to be causal when it is deadlock-free. A property of the problem's information structure that is necessary and sufficient to ensure deadlock-freeness is identified, and this property is shown to be sufficient to ensure that all of the generic problem's control policies possess expected rewards. It is also shown, by example, that there exist stochastic control problems for which all sequential policies are suboptimal. These results subsume Witsenhausen's "causality" condition (property C), suggest a framework for the optimization of non-sequential stochastic control problems, and provide a surprisingly intuitive characterization of the cause/effect notion of causality. The results also have game theoretic implications|they suggest, for instance, necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite game to possess an extensive form.

Conditions based on the problem's design-dependent properties are introduced in a companion paper <ref> [1] </ref>. 3. Design-Independent Conditions In this section, necessary and sufficient conditions for problem (P) to be well-posed and causal are developed under the assumption that the problem's design set is unconstrained (i.e., C = ).

Reference-contexts: Most game-theoretic models that accommodate non-sequentiality are variations of Kuhn's extensive form [10], a "game tree" representation that precludes deadlock by definition (cf. [17], x2). The discrete event models that accommodate non-sequentiality are, for the most part, state transition- (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>, [14]), algebraic equation- (e.g., [7], [8], [13]), or logical calculus- (e.g., [6], [12], [15]) based representations of the action sequences (traces) that a system can generate; consequently, they are incompatible with the usual control theoretic representations of uncertainty and information. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: However, they presuppose a fixed ordering of the system's control actions. In this paper we relax this assumption. 2.1 Preliminaries Consider a generic stochastic system in which the number of control actions and uncontrolled inputs are both finite (Figure 1, page 5). From a game theoretic perspective (cf. <ref> [16] </ref>), the control actions can be viewed as being the actions of N distinct decision-making agents (computers, devices, processes, etc.). Likewise the uncontrolled inputs can be viewed a single action of nature (chance).

[V (w; fl (w))] exists. Systems that satisfy i) are said to possess property S while systems that satisfy ii) are said to possess property SM <ref> [17] </ref>. 3.2 Property CI Property SM holds when, for each fl 2 , and each uncontrolled input ! 2 , every agent's action is uniquely determined and the actions' !-dependence is B-measurable. <p> rule out the possibility that, for some ! 2 , agent N 's information depends on agent 1's action, and for all k = 1; 2; . . . ; N 1, agent k's information depends on agent k+1's action, property SM is not sufficient to ensure property DF (cf. <ref> [17] </ref>, Thm. 2)|i.e., although property SM holds, for some ! 2 , every agent's information may depend on every other agents' actions, and consequently, for that !, no agent can act without precognition. <p> Intuition suggests that such deadlocks can not arise if for each ! 2 , the agents can be ordered such that each agent's information only depends on ! and its predecessors' actions. To formalize this intuition it is convenient to adopt the notation in <ref> [17] </ref>. For all k = 1; 2; . . . ; N , define S k to be the set of all k-agent orderings|i.e., all injections of f1; 2; . . . ; kg into f1; 2; . . . ; N g. <p> Accordingly, it is always possible to construct a design that deadlocks. 4. Property CI's Relationship to Property C Witsenhausen was the first to develop conditions sufficient to ensure a system's deadlock-freeness (he termed it "causality"). Specifically, he introduced the following property. Definition 2 <ref> [17] </ref>: An information structure I possesses property C (causality) when there exists at least one map : fi U ! S N such that for all s := (s 1 ; s 2 ; . . . ; s k ) 2 S k ; k = 1; 2; . . <p> Theorem 2 <ref> [17] </ref>: Let I be an arbitrary information structure; then: (i) I possesses property SM if I possesses property C, and (ii) I possesses property DF if I possesses property C. Proof: See [17], Sections 6 and 7. <p> Theorem 2 <ref> [17] </ref>: Let I be an arbitrary information structure; then: (i) I possesses property SM if I possesses property C, and (ii) I possesses property DF if I possesses property C. Proof: See [17], Sections 6 and 7. Since property C implies property DF (Thm. 2 (ii)), and since property DF implies property CI (Thm. 1 (ii)), it is clear that Corollary 1: Property C implies Property CI. Proof: See Appendix C for a direct proof. <p> Non-equivalence would imply, that property C is in general, only a sufficient condition for deadlock-freeness. When N 2, properties C and CI are always equivalent. Formally 8 Here, in contrast to <ref> [17] </ref>, is a mapping from fi U to S N and F (O) is the cylindrical extension of B to fi U (see [19]). 18 Corollary 2: Property CI implies property C when N 2. <p> These results subsume the principal result in <ref> [17] </ref> (Thm. 1), and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for unconstrained stochastic control problems of the form (P) to be well-posed and causal.
