Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Continuous planning refers to the process of planning in a world under continual change. Traditionally, as new world information is encountered, a planner adapts to it through the refinement of the plans that are under construction. The major thesis of this paper, however, is that often it is necessary to modify the goals of the planner in addition to the plans themselves. We introduce the concept of goal transformations in a continuous planner. The extended planner can automatically select the appropriate goal transformations in response to world changes and can completely solve the transformed problem. We present a set of goal transformations that handle, in particular, changes in resources in the world. We introduce a detailed taxonomy of goal transformations. We implemented several transformations within a planning system, and we show empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: However, the adjustment that planners classically perform given dynamic events during planning entails change with regard to the knowledge concerning the current state of the world and, in response, adaptation of the current plan. During execution of plans, outcomes may diverge from expectations, so plans are again adjusted accordingly <ref> (see Tate, Hendler, & Drummond, 1990) </ref>. The major thesis of this paper, however, is that the adjustment of the goals of the planner is often required in addition to the adjustment of the plans themselves.

Reference-contexts: Different choices give rise to different ways of exploring the search space. These choices are guided by either control rules (see Carbonell, et al., 1992; Minton, 1988), by past problem-solving episodes (i.e., cases; see Veloso, 1994), or by domain-independent heuristics <ref> (see Veloso & Stone, 1995) </ref>. Prodigy4.0 follows a sequence of decision choices, selecting a goal, an operator, and an instantiation for the operator to achieve the goal.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, subgoaling on the preconditions of a planning operator can be considered a goal intrusion transformation. Finally, when a rationale-based sensing monitor suggests a plan-based cut <ref> (Veloso, Pollack, & Cox, 1997) </ref>, this is equivalent to a goal retraction transformation.

The continuous planning version of the system includes two primary changes (last bullet in 3 and line 5 from whenever the plan has been updated.
