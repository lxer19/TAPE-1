Abstract: Boston College Computer Science Department Technical Report BCCS-98-01 (June 1998) Appears in 1998 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Vehicles, Stuttgart, Germany, October 1998. ABSTRACT This paper describes and evaluates a real-time vision system that detects and tracks vehicles on highways under reduced visibility conditions. The system uses a forward looking video camera in a moving car to estimate the distances of the car to other vehicles on the road. Results of experiments on images sequences in difficult visibility conditions are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Vision systems that automatically analyze highway scenes from a moving vehicle have been remarkably successful in fair weather conditions (see, for example, <ref> [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13] </ref> ). Reliability of these systems, however, is also required for reduced visibility conditions that are due to rainy or snowy weather, tunnels and underpasses, and driving at night, dusk and dawn. <p> This description is then used to estimate the positions of the vehicles in the environment and their distances from the camera-assisted car.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the symmetry of the tracked objects is ex ploited. * Due to the strong up-and-down motion of the video camera in the camera-assisted car, tracking windows are adjusted adap tively. * Road boundaries and lane markings are detected in each frame by a spatial recursive least squares filter <ref> [5] </ref>. * A statistical model for "road color" is computed o*ine, which is then used online to 2 classify the pixels that image the road and to discriminate them from pixels that image obstacles such as other vehicles.
