Abstract: Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service network remains a challenging research problem. Most protocols for reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay, which can lead to missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a repair technique that combines forward error correction (FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in reliable multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal state at senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond what is required by the current multicast service model. Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair request implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth usage for repairs low. We show how a protocol using the technique can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time deadline with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations of the protocol that use the technique in various fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations that examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.

Reference-contexts: The topology was constructed in a similar manner to the trees used in the round-by-round simulation in Section 4. We use a single tree for all multicast transmissions, including receiver NAKs. This corresponds a routing protocol like CBT <ref> [2] </ref>. The results from our simulation can be considered as pessimistic bounds for protocols that can construct multiple trees depending on the source of the multicast transmission.

The group size is restricted to 500 due to the memory and time constraints imposed by the multicast group size on such a simulation. The results presented here used a randomly constructed tree topology, where the minimum, average, maximum hops to the sender were 7, 15.1, and 25 respectively.
