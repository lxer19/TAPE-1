Title: The Rank of Sparse Random Matrices over Finite Fields  
Author: Johannes Blomer Richard Karp Emo Welzl 
Abstract: Let M be a random matrix over GF[q] such that for each entry M ij in M and for each non-zero field element ff the probability Pr[M ij = ff] is p=(q 1), where p = (log n c)=n and c is an arbitrary but fixed positive constant. The probability for a matrix entry to be zero is 1 p. It is shown that the expected rank of M is n O(1): Furthermore, there is a constant A such that the probability that the rank is less than n k is less than A=q k : It is also shown that if c grows depending on n and is unbounded as n goes to infinity then the expected difference between the rank of M and n is unbounded.

Reference-contexts: Our results are complementary to a recent result of Calkin [?] about linear dependencies over GF <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The results of this paper imply the following result. Assume that c (n) is a function that is unbounded as n goes to infinity and assume that p = (log n O (1))=n: If n vectors are chosen in (GF <ref> [2] </ref>) n such that each entry in a vector is 1 with probability p, then the probability that less than n c (n) of these vectors are linearly independent tends to 0 for n ! 1. <p> It is a well-known result (see for example [?]) that a random (nfin)-matrix over GF [q]; where each entry is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the elements of GF [q]; is nonsingular with at least some constant probability. For example, over GF <ref> [2] </ref> the probability is roughly 0:29 (and the probability that the defect excceds 2 tends to less than 0:06). On the other hand, Corollary ?? shows that for p = log n=n c=n the random matrix M is almost nonsingular with high probability. This poses the following question. <p> On the other hand, Corollary ?? shows that for p = log n=n c=n the random matrix M is almost nonsingular with high probability. This poses the following question. Assume that a random (nfin)-matrix M over GF <ref> [2] </ref> is chosen such that each entry M ij is 0 with probability 1 p and is 1 with probability p: What is the smallest p such that the probability that M is nonsingular is bounded from below by some constant? So far, we have not been able to prove the
