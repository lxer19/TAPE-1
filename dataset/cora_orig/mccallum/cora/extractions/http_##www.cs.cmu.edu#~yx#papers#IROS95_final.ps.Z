Title: Moment Filters For High Precision Computation of Focus and Stereo

Abstract: Many low level visual computation problems such as focus, stereo, etc. can be formulated as problems of extracting one or more parameters of a non-stationary transformation between two images. Because of the non-stationary nature, finite-width windows are widely used in various algorithms to extract spatially local information from images. While the choice of window width has a very profound impact on the quality of results of algorithms, there has been no quantitative way to measure or eliminate the negative effects of finite-width windows. To address this problem, We introduce a new set of filters, moment filters. Due to their recursiveness in the Fourier and spatial domains, these filters allow the effects of finite-width windows and foreshortening to be explicitly analyzed and eliminated.

Reference-contexts: The RMS errors we use below are in pixel widths. We first tested the stereo algorithms on synthetic images. The synthetic image pair is the 20th and 21st frames of the translating tree sequence <ref> [1] </ref> as in Figure 11 (b). The scene is a planar surface textured by a picture of a tree. Because the ground truth of the motion is in horizontal direction, we can use them as a stereo pair.

Reference-contexts: We apply the technique of moment filters to the problems of focus and stereo. Traditionally, people estimate the parameter by comparing the outputs of convolutions of the two images with the same filter, usually a Gabor filter. Examples in focus are [5, 7, 10], in stereo are <ref> [6, 8, 2] </ref>. Our moment filter approach provides a new insight into this traditional approach by showing that the output of the convolution of one image with a Gabor filter can be represented as an infinite sum of the output of convolutions of the other image with moment filters. <p> Therefore, when the magnitude of U 1 or U 2 is not small, using Eq. 23 to compute D 0 will result into large errors. It is not a surprise to learn that the stability constraint used by Fleet et al <ref> [2] </ref> is actually the magnitude ratio of U 1 and U 0 , i.e. k @x 1 @a k= k U 0 k where is the phase, and a is the magnitude.

A simple SSD-based matching is performed to generate pixel resolution disparity, and the same pixel resolution disparity is used for our algorithms and Kanade & Okutomi's algorithm. We implemented our algorithms under the fixed window scheme. More details of the implementation can be found in [9].
