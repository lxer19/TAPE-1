Title: Guiding or Hiding: Explorations into the Effects of Learning on the Rate of Evolution.  
Author: Giles Mayley

Abstract: Individual lifetime learning can `guide' an evolving population to areas of high fitness in genotype space through an evolutionary phenomenon known as the Baldwin effect (Baldwin, 1896; Hin-ton & Nowlan, 1987). It is the accepted wisdom that this guiding speeds up the rate of evolution. By highlighting another interaction between learning and evolution, that will be termed the Hiding effect, it will be argued here that this depends on the measure of evolutionary speed one adopts. The Hiding effect shows that learning can reduce the selection pressure between individuals by `hiding' their genetic differences. There is thus a trade-off between the Baldwin effect and the Hiding effect to determine learning's influence on evolution and two factors that contribute to this trade-off, the cost of learning and landscape epis tasis, are investigated experimentally.

Reference-contexts: However, unlike the Baldwin effect, I have not see any investigation into the nature or conditions of this effect. The Hiding effect can be considered as one of the costs or selective disadvantages of learning <ref> (intro. Belew & Mitchell, 1996) </ref>. It occurs like this: Members of an evolving population with different genotypes are selected for according to their phenotypic traits. The differences between the genotypes produce differences between their associated phenotypes that allow selection to get a hold and make a discrimination.

Reference-contexts: However, there are many evolutionary scenarios that cannot be described as function optimisation; for example, the Species Adaptive Genetic Algorithms (SAGA) of Harvey (1992) or coevolutionary systems that are prone to Red-Queen effects <ref> (Cliff & Miller, 1995) </ref>. In these cases, measures of evolutionary speed, rate or progress that simply involve the number of generations until a fit phenotype is produced are meaningless since there will always be evolutionary driven movement in genotype space that may not lead to fitness increases.

Reference-contexts: The goals of evolution and learning are to produce phenotypes with the highest fitness according to Kauffman's NK fitness landscape model <ref> (Kauffman, 1993) </ref>. It is expected that Kauffman's NK fitness model with N = 8, K = 2. the majority of the readership is familiar with NK fitness landscapes but for those who are not, here is the briefest of descriptions.

Reference-contexts: Assuming these costs become reduced the `more innate' a trait becomes, then they provide the selection pressure for the reduction in the level of learning that is necessary for genetic assimilation to occur. Another condition that has been discussed in <ref> (Mayley, 1996b) </ref> is that the genotypic space and the phenotypic space must have the property of neighbourhood correlation with respect to the genetic operators and the learning rule for genetic assimilation of a learned trait to be guaranteed.

Reference-contexts: Learning has guided evolution to the fitness peak. genotypes at the beginning of a generation and are then modified by learning on the same task <ref> (Menczer & Belew, 1994) </ref> and given a fitness score. The fitness score of the modified individual is used for the purposes of selection among conspecifics but no information about the structure or behaviour of the modified individual is translated back into the genotype.

Reference-contexts: The `centre of gravity' of the population thus moves in genotype space towards the area of increased fitness (Figure 1b) and the initially learned trait may become innate in subsequent generations (Figure 1c) in a process known as genetic assimilation <ref> (Waddington, 1942) </ref>. It can be said that learning is `guiding' evolution (Hinton & Nowlan, 1987; Maynard Smith, 1987). This process is subject to a few conditions, though.
