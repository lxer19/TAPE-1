Title: Learning Anaphoric Metaphors

Abstract: In this paper we describe an experiment conceived for the study of metaphor learning. Subjects repeatedly exposed to one anaphoric metaphor gradually become faster at understanding it. We hypothesize that, in the case of anaphoric metaphors, people are first looking for literal meanings, and, failing to find it, they create a new (metaphorical) meaning for the vehicle of the metaphor. An ACT-R model to test this theory has been developed; the model captures the main trends observed in the experimental data.
