Abstract: The degree to which a planner succeeds and meets response deadlines depends on the correctness and completeness of its models which describe events and actions that change the world state. It is often unrealistic to expect perfect models, so a planner must detect and respond to states it had not planned to handle. In this paper, we characterize different classes of these "unhandled" states and describe planning algorithms to build tests for, and later respond to them. We have implemented these unhandled state detection and response algorithms in the Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA), and present experiments from flight simulation that show how the new algorithm enables a fully-automated aircraft to react appropriately to certain classes of unhandled states, averting failure and giving the aircraft a new chance to achieve its goals.

Reference-contexts: In either situation, failure to notice and react to the problem will cause a crash. We included simple features gear with values up and down and traffic with values yes and no. We will discuss only the gear failure emergency here. Results from additional aircraft tests are discussed in <ref> (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1996) </ref>. During normal flight, the gear was left down. A TTF occurred with gear "up" to simulate the impending crash.

Reference-contexts: Timely reactions may be achieved either by bounding execution times for replanning and rescheduling, or by building reactions in advance. Many of todays architectures bound planner execution time ((Dean et. al. 1993), <ref> (Garvey and Lesser 1993) </ref>). We hope to enhance CIRCAs capabilities using such ideas.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms to build tests for deadend, removed, and imminent-failure states are described below. TAPs could include tests for every set of features in that unhandled state list (e.g., each deadend state), but these tests would be repeated frequently during plan execution and may be time-consuming, as in PRS <ref> (Ingrand and Georgeff 1990) </ref>, where context checking could involve a large, non-minimal number of tests, including updates from sensors.

Reference-contexts: In CIRCA, once an unhandled state list is completed, the planner calls ID3 <ref> (Quinlan 1986) </ref> with that list as the set of positive examples and a subset of the reachable states (depending on unhandled state type) as the set of negative examples. ID3 returns what it considers a minimal test set, which is then used to detect that unhandled state class.

Reference-contexts: With the addition of unhandled state feedback, CIRCA begins to reach beyond traditional autopilots, allowing the system to select a new plan which may not reach the previous goal but that can avoid failure and divert to a new location if necessary. We interfaced the ACM F-16 flight simulator <ref> (Rainey 1994) </ref> to a Proportional-Derivative (P-D) controller (Rowland 1986) that calculates actuator commands to achieve a specific altitude and heading.
