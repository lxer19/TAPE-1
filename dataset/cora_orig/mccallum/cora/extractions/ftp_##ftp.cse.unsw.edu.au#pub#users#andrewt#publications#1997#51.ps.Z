Title: Acquisition of Search Knowledge

Abstract: The development of highly effective heuristics for search problems is a difficult and time-consuming task. We present a knowledge acquisition approach to incrementally model expert search processes. Though, experts do not normally have introspective access to that knowledge, their explanations of actual search considerations seems very valuable in constructing a knowledge level model of their search processes. The incremental method was inspired by the work on Ripple-Down Rules which allows knowledge acquisition and maintenance without analysis or a knowledge engineer. We substantially extend Ripple Down Rules to allow undefined terms in the conditions. These undefined terms in turn become defined by Ripple Down Rules. The resulting framework is called Nested Ripple Down Rules. Our system SmS1.2 (SmS for Smart Searcher), has been employed for the acquisition of expert chess knowledge for performing a highly pruned tree search. Our first experimental results in the chess domain are evidence for the validity of our approach, even though a number of the planned features are still under develop ment.

Reference-contexts: Capturing the expertise being employed for such skilled search processes is a difficult task. This is reflected in the great efforts being spent on building tools for semi-automatic or even automatic design for many technical problems, e.g. in circuit design [18], mechanical design <ref> [13] </ref> or architecture [14]. For example, in circuit design, usually the design produced by current design tools is optimised by human intervention. The process of such human intervention is very difficult to formalise and, thus does not usually become automated.

Reference-contexts: Either their explanation would not cover the step they would take or their explanation would suggest search steps they would actually not consider. Thus, we pursue an approach similar to <ref> [16] </ref>, which allows to incrementally acquire complex concept definitions without demanding an operational definition from the expert. Rather, the expert is merely required to judge whether the concept applies to particular instances.
