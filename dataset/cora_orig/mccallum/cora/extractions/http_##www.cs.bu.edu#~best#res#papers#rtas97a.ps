Abstract: In a recently completed study, we have unveiled a new transport protocol, TCP Boston, that turns ATM's 53-byte cell-oriented switching architecture into an advantage for TCP/IP. In this paper, we demonstrate the real-time features of TCP Boston that allow communication bandwidth to be traded off for timeliness. We start with an overview of the protocol, and analytically characterize the dynamic redundancy control features of TCP Boston. Next, we present detailed simulation results that show the superiority TCP Boston compared to other adaptations of TCP/IP over ATMs. Namely, we show that it improves TCP/IP's performance over ATMs for both network-centric metrics (e.g., throughput and percent of missed deadlines) and real-time application-centric metrics (e.g., response time and jitter).

Reference-contexts: The output buffer uses FIFO scheduling, and cells in input ports are served in a round-robin fashion to ensure fairness. In our simulations, the ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) implements the basic functions found in AAL5, namely fragmentation and reconstruction of IP packets <ref> [2, 16] </ref>. To support TCP Boston the destination AAL reconstructs a packet out of the received cells even when the resulting packet is incomplete. Incomplete packets are discarded by the destination AAL for Reno and Vegas implementation.

Reference-contexts: There have been a number of attempts to remedy this problem by introducing additional switch-level functionalities to preserve throughput when TCP/IP is employed over ATM. Examples include the Selective Cell Discard (SCD) <ref> [3] </ref> and the Early Packet Discard (EPD) [23]. In SCD, once a cell c is dropped at a switch, all subsequent cells from the packet to which c belongs are dropped by the switch.

Reference-contexts: Four different packet sizes were selected to reflect maximum transfer unit (MTU) of popular standards: 576 bytes for IP packets, 1,500 bytes for Ethernet, 4,470 bytes for FDDI link standards [20], and 9,180 bytes which is the recommended packet size for IP over ATM <ref> [4] </ref>. The values for the TCP window size are 8 kB, 16 kB, 32 kB, and 64 kB. Buffer sizes used for the ATM switch are 64, 256, 512, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 cells.

Reference-contexts: Both the dispersal and reconstruction operations are simple linear transformations that can be performed in real-time <ref> [5] </ref>. The IDA approach is different from other redundancy-injecting protocols in that redundancy is added uniformly; there is simply no distinction between data and parity. This feature makes it possible to scale the amount of redundancy used in IDA. Indeed, this is the basis for Adaptive IDA (AIDA) [6].

Using AIDA, a bandwidth allocation operation is inserted after the dispersal operation but prior to transmission. This step allows the system to scale the amount of redundancy used in the transmission.

Reference-contexts: For realistic, multi-hop ATM networks the cumulative wasted bandwidth (as a result of cells discarded through SCD or EPD) may be large, and the impact of the ensuing packet losses on the performance of TCP is likely to be severe. Our Research: In a recent study <ref> [7] </ref>, we have unveiled a new transport protocol, TCP Boston, that turns ATM's packet fragmentation problem into an advantage for TCP/IP, thus enhancing the performance of TCP in general and its performance in ATM environments in particular. <p> AIDA makes TCP/IP's performance less sensitive to cell losses, thus ensuring a graceful degradation of TCP/IP's performance when faced with congested resources. The details of TCP Boston, along with analytical and simulation results that show its superior performance, have been presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper, we unveil the real-time capabilities of TCP Boston that allow it to trade off network bandwidth for timeliness through the use of AIDA's Forward Error Correction (FEC) features. We start in section 2 with an overview of TCP Boston. <p> to be less than 5%, then the appropriate value for ff would be 1, making the necessary percentage of bandwidth to trade off for timeliness equal to 3%. 2.2 Overview of TCP Boston In this section we give a high level description of our implementation of TCP Boston detailed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The purpose of TCP Boston is to provide a reliable transfer of data for end-to-end applications. It consists of three components: Session Manager, Segment Manager, and Flow Manager. <p> This multiplexing is beneficial since cell (or packet) drops are likely to occur in bundles [9]. For a baseline performance characterization of Boston-FEC, Boston-BP, and Vegas we rely on two metrics: effective throughput and response time. The results obtained for these metrics are similar to those presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, where the performance of a Reno-based implementation of TCP Boston (as opposed to the Vegas-based implementation presented here) was characterized. Effective Throughput Characteristics: The effective throughput (or goodput) refers to the throughput where only the bytes that are useful at the application layer are considered.

The poor performance of TCP over ATMs is mainly due to packet fragmentation, when a relatively large-sized IP packet flows into an ATM virtual circuit through the AAL5 (ATM Adaptation Layer 5)[2].

Reference-contexts: In addition, segments that belong to current transmission window are multiplexed, so that the cells that belong to a packet are interleaved in the transmission line. This multiplexing is beneficial since cell (or packet) drops are likely to occur in bundles <ref> [9] </ref>. For a baseline performance characterization of Boston-FEC, Boston-BP, and Vegas we rely on two metrics: effective throughput and response time.

Reference-contexts: Since the response time (and thus the standard deviation of the response time) varies widely for various switch buffer sizes, a more consistent measure of variabilityand thus (un)predictabilitywould be one that normalizes the standard deviation of the response time relative to its mean (using the Z-score theory <ref> [10] </ref>). Figures 6 (e) show the behavior of such a variability index.
