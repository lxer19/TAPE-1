Abstract: In this paper we present three scheduling mechanisms that are manipulation-proof for closed systems. The amount of information that each user must encode in the mechanism increases with the complexity of the mechanism. On the other hand, the more complex the mechanism is, the more it maintains the privacy of the users. (for the most part) and allows users to have the greatest influence on the resulting schedule.

Reference-contexts: Some common criteria include Pareto Optimality, Fairness, and Individual Rationality. 1 In this section we briefly summarize the most common criteria. 1 The issues of solution criteria are discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, in the context of combining various default theories. 2 2.1 Attributes of Social Decision Processes In general, the optimality of the decision process may be viewed with respect to two main aspects/categories: attributes of the resulting decision, and attributes of the group decision mechanism itself.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the process answers both the "simplicity" and "stability" criteria. A second advantage of the technique is that it satisfies several desirable criteria, including the "Condorcet Winner" (|a choice that would have beaten every other choice in pair-wise votes is guaranteed to be chosen by the mechanism <ref> [6] </ref>), "monotonicity" (|by giving an alternative a higher value, a user cannot undermine the alternative's selection), "independence of irrelevant alternatives" (|removal of any "unchosen" alternative from the set of alternatives will not change the outcome [28]), "individual rationality" (a user may only gain utility by taking part in the process), "anonymity"

Reference-contexts: It seems reasonable, however, that the preferences of certain users (e.g., managers) might carry greater weight in deciding when to set a meeting. Fortunately, the influence of a user on the social decision may be easily controlled without losing the power of the mechanism as an effective preference revealer <ref> [7] </ref> (of course, by assigning weights to users we lose the possibility of anonymity). This control may be achieved by giving an influence weight z i (2 IR + ) to each user u i .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The basic research problem in meeting scheduling is that of timing, that is, when to set a meeting. This question becomes more complicated when there are several meetings to be scheduled that involve the same resources (mainly participants), and as the number of participants (constraints) grows <ref> [14, 18] </ref>. One key question is how to allocate all the feasible time slots for a meeting [20, 21]. Another key question is how to choose, among these possible time slots, the most appropriate one for a particular meeting [26]. This paper is concerned with both of the above questions.

Reference-contexts: However, the CTm requires the least amount of tax to be paid, from among the members of this decision mechanism family [12]. It guarantees the best minimal utility level for each of the participants, and is the only mechanism within this family that has no free-rider problem <ref> [15] </ref> (i.e., a user will not be tempted to avoid the process, hoping to benefit from the decision without the risk of paying the tax). All these good attributes make the mechanism a very desirable tool for meeting scheduling.
