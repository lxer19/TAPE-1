Abstract: This paper presents a neural network based approach to a mobile robot positioning in front of a certain local object. The robot is equipped with ultrasonic range sensors mounted round the platform. We employ the Fuzzy-ARTMAP network for supervised learning of associations between vectors of sensors readouts and the robot's pose coordinates. In this approach, a world model in a form of a map, as well as its updating routine, become superflous for the considered problem solution. The system, trained on a real world data of a door neighborhood region reveals satisfactory performance, sufficient for a door passing task purposes. The proposed method of a mobile robot positioning may be efficiently applied in environments containing natural, geometrical beacons.

Reference-contexts: For each training stage three sequences of testing, with use of different testing sets, were performed. Three empirical error rates were calculated for each learning trial <ref> [19, 1] </ref>. The overall error rate E ov experesses a total number of wrong associations made by the taught system among the training set.

Reference-contexts: The tool we implemented is the Fuzzy-ARTMAP neural network, described in the following section. 2 Fuzzy-ARTMAP for learning localization associations ART is a class of neural network structures, based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory <ref> [2] </ref>, which perform nonlinear, incremental, unsupervised categorization of a set of input data. The fundamental ART algorithm divides input vectors into a number of clusters, in such a way that the data belonging to each cluster are all similar within a specified tolerance.

Reference-contexts: Thus new patterns may fit in and modify shapes of existing categories, if they match closely, or require establishing new categories when neccesary. The Fuzzy-ART network <ref> [3] </ref> is one of the ART family. It accepts real-valued components of input vectors, and treats data as patterns of fuzzy membership values. The procedure extends to representing to which degree subsequent features are present in an input vector or in a certain recognition category. <p> Actually, the absence of a feature, and even the extent to which the feature is absent in the data vector, may also be taken into account by the Fuzzy-ART module, when it is implemented in a complementary coding form <ref> [3] </ref>. The ARTMAP system [4] is composed of the two ART networks, interconnected by the layer of neuronlike nodes called a map field. This layer is used to form predictive associations between categories established in ART a and ART b structures (Fig.2).

Reference-contexts: This brings them close to the classical approaches based upon vectorial description of the world (as in <ref> [5] </ref>). The matching evaluation techniques range from geometrical methods for obtaining relative displacements and rotations neccesary to transform the perceived scene description into the pre-defined one [5, 13], to those employing Kalman fiter formalism for tracking some environmental features to update the estimated robot's pose [16, 12, 18, 15]. <p> This brings them close to the classical approaches based upon vectorial description of the world (as in [5]).

Reference-contexts: The location of a mobile robot is usually described by the estimates of the vehicle's position and orientation (the pose) expressed in some coordinate system, coupled with certain statistical measures of the estimation errors <ref> [7] </ref>. A typical approach is to reduce the position estimation problem to that of matching a perceived configuration of the robot's environment with an a priori known model of it, usually given as a map.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Mobile robot navigation problem can be stated into three fundamental sub-problems: estimation of the current position with respect to the goal and surrounding objects, finding an obstacle-free path between some distinguished locations and execution of the preplanned trajectory <ref> [12] </ref>.
