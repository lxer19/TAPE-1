Title: Exceptions and Applets in Java Programming nature and will attempt to examine a particular facet

Abstract: Introduction In the two previous articles in this series, we have examined the basic syntax of the Java language, the structure of a Java program, building classes and using native classes and the use of standard packages included with the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Sun MicroSystems. As was mentioned in the first article the true power of the language is the ability to bring life in the form of sound and animation to web pages and internet applications. The work so far has been to set up for these types of applications called applets. An applets is nothing more than a small piece of Java code executing in either your Java-enabled browser or a tool called an applet viewer. (Netscape 2.0 is Java-enabled). Once the applet code is built you have to build the HTML (Hyper-Text Markup-Language) code to integrate the applet into your web page. Handling Exceptions Before moving on to building applets and web pages, there is one more significant piece of the Java language that needs to be examined, exceptions. An exception is a run-time error. Examples of such errors include: an error opening a file, indexing past the end of an array, generic system call errors. In languages you probably most often work with (C and C++) errors like this are probably the result of one of two things:a failed system call which we can handle by calling perror() or from a programming error that leads to a signal being sent and maybe terminating the program (SIGSEGV or SIGBUS).
