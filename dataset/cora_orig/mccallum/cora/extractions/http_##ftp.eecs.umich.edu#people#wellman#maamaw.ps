Abstract: A computational market is any collection of software agents interacting through a price system. Markets can provide effective allocation of resources for a variety of distributed environments, and economic analysis a powerful design tool for interaction mechanisms. The spread of computational markets puts a premium on market-aware agents, and presents a case for market awareness on the part of agent developers and AI researchers as well.

Reference-contexts: developing a variety of computational market systems, we have found that decisions about good space typically drive an extensive chain of related design decisions [27]. 3.2.1 Time and Uncertainty One very common set of issues arises when goods have temporal extent, such as systems that schedule time in a factory <ref> [1] </ref>, or on a CPU. In such cases, the time that a resource is available is a defining attribute. Today's newspaper is different than next week's, and today's newspaper available today is different than today's available next week.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction By its very name, the workshop on "Modelling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World" (MAAMAW) <ref> [2] </ref> envisions a universe populated by numerous (presumably artificial) agents, acting and interacting autonomously. This interaction produces behaviors of complexity beyond our means to predict|hence the need for the modeling effort called for in MAAMAW's first "M". <p> In the years since this conference was founded, research trends and technological developments have conspired to render this multiagent vision a fl Based on an invited talk at MAAMAW-97 <ref> [2] </ref>. 1 commonplace, to the point of cliche. Any Internet user even vaguely follow-ing the popular press will naturally anticipate a future where autonomous agents roam the net, serving our needs, representing our interests, engaging other agents, and generally interacting on our behalf.

Reference-contexts: As market mechanisms become more prevalent (for reasons adduced above and otherwise), design of agents specializing in market interactions will become an important category of agent research. Artificial intelligence and economics both have much to say about the principles of agent design <ref> [3] </ref>, and we expect that design principles specific to market mechanisms will build on these foundations.

Reference-contexts: Although we make no attempt to survey existing work bearing on this topic, at least one current research topic seems worthy of 5 Cases where agents are under the control or partial control of the designers may call for very different approaches <ref> [4] </ref>. In such situations, the agency of the modules is more ambiguous, as their autonomy is somewhat compromised. 16 mention. One way to classify agents in a multiagent system is with respect to the degree and depth to which agents attempt to reason about each other.

Reference-contexts: results are valued (defined by the consumption sector), from (2) what can be done to produce results with resources (the production sector). 4 1.3 Mechanisms The method by which an allocation is determined for a multiagent system is what we call a multiagent interaction protocol, or more simply, a mechanism <ref> [5] </ref>. A mechanism describes a communication protocol, in effect defining who can communicate with whom and what message types are allowed. The study of allocation mechanisms and their properties is known in economics as mechanism design [10, 19]. <p> We present some of the more important ones below. A more detailed explanation of some of these can be found in Campbell's monograph on resource allocation <ref> [5, Chapter 2] </ref>. Rosenschein and Zlotkin [20, Chapter 2] discuss a similar set of desiderata in the context of multiagent systems. Note that these criteria apply to all resource allocation mechanisms, not just market systems. * Privacy preservation.

Reference-contexts: In that case, a price quote is essential for effective coordination of the agent's exchanges. For example, in the taton-nement and related protocols <ref> [6, 13] </ref>, agents adjust their bids for all goods based on changes in prices for all goods. Indeed, methods for reaching general equilibrium invariably rely on such iterative price adjustment processes.

Reference-contexts: The idea that markets in uncertain propositions can be used to coordinate decentralized behavior under uncertainty was first proposed in the context of multiagent systems by Hanson <ref> [8] </ref>. In our own work, we have shown how securities markets can serve to aggregate the beliefs of multiple agents with possibly divergent information sources [18].

Reference-contexts: We might also distinguish variant forms of k-level agents, according to whether they reason about other agents individually or in the aggregate. In one recent investigation <ref> [9] </ref>, we compared agents of different types acting within a simple market game. Specifically, the experiments included 0-level (competitive) agents, along with 1-level agents that formed an aggregate model of the others as competitive.

Reference-contexts: A mechanism describes a communication protocol, in effect defining who can communicate with whom and what message types are allowed. The study of allocation mechanisms and their properties is known in economics as mechanism design <ref> [10, 19] </ref>. Unmediated mechanisms involve bilateral, or multilateral, communication among all of the agents involved. Such mechanisms may not scale well to large numbers of agents. In mediated mechanisms, on the other hand, agents submit messages to some institution implementing the mechanism (or a part thereof).

Reference-contexts: Specifically, Mount and Reiter [17] have shown that the competitive mechanism (i.e., behaving according to given prices) minimizes the dimensionality of the message space required to determine an efficient allocation for convex problems. Jordan has further shown that this mechanism is uniquely minimal <ref> [11] </ref>. 7 Prices structure the mechanism protocol.

Reference-contexts: Although the price system is restrictive (at least in the sense of narrowing the set of reachable allocations), basing a mechanism on prices has numerous advantages <ref> [12] </ref>. Here we mention several, without doing complete justice to all the underlying subtleties. Prices define a common scale of resource value. Rather than consider all combinations of good exchanges, agents and mechanism institutions can simply relate each good to the common scale.

Reference-contexts: For example, a competitive equilibrium is an equilibrium allocation in which each agent gets its optimal choice, given resource prices reported by the mechanism. Under certain conditions, competitive equilibria can 9 be shown to exist <ref> [13] </ref>, along with convergent mechanisms. Under fairly general circumstances, any such equilibrium must be Pareto efficient. 3.2 Good Space Selecting the commodities which will be traded is often the most difficult part of the design process. Sometimes a resource allocation problem has an obvious breakdown into commodities. <p> Whereas it would usually be inconceivable to introduce goods corresponding to every resource in every state of nature, it generally suffices to introduce securities|one for each state|paying off in some designated resource unit if the state obtains <ref> [13] </ref>. Of course, this too may require too many goods, and so we will often prefer to cover only a selected set of important contingencies. <p> In that case, a price quote is essential for effective coordination of the agent's exchanges. For example, in the taton-nement and related protocols <ref> [6, 13] </ref>, agents adjust their bids for all goods based on changes in prices for all goods. Indeed, methods for reaching general equilibrium invariably rely on such iterative price adjustment processes.

Reference-contexts: The general definition of an auction (see <ref> [14] </ref>) is quite general indeed. It essentially includes any well-defined mediated protocol that determines prices as a function of messages submitted by participating agents. As a type of protocol, an auction is defined in terms of the messages that comprise it. <p> By reporting such information, auctions reduce the information inequality that would otherwise exist between agents participating in previous transactions and everyone else. Exactly what interim information is revealed and when can have a significant effect on agents' bidding strategies and the overall effects of auctions. Theoretical analysis of auctions <ref> [14, 16] </ref> is always based on explicit assumptions about price quotes. For example, sealed-bid auctions are defined as those that eschew price quotes altogether. Sometimes, limiting or even eliminating information revealed through price quotes can be a beneficial policy.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the FCC spectrum auctions, an agent was dropped out of the iterative bidding process whenever it failed to maintain some number of high bids among the recent bidding history <ref> [15] </ref>. 3.3.3 Notifications Notifications per se are not very interesting; they merely report the result of the auction process. What is salient, of course, is how the allocation is determined itself. The allocation determination event is called a clear, as in clearing a market.

Reference-contexts: The reason is that the strategic agents may had no way to verify their conjectures about actions not taken, and so they often missed favorable opportunities. In a related model, Sandholm and Ygge <ref> [21] </ref> also found that competitive agents could outperform their strategic counterparts under uncertain conditions, as the more sophisticated policies were more sensitive to errors in models formed. Clearly, these types of experiments merely scratch the surface.

Reference-contexts: When M = 1, these prices reduce to the well known first- and second-price auctions (with reservation prices). As Vickrey demonstrated in his seminal work on auction analysis <ref> [24] </ref>, the second-price sealed-bid auction is incentive compatible with respect to bids to buy. The (M + 1)st-price sealed-bid auction is similarly incentive compatible for buyers, and the M th-price auction for sellers.

Reference-contexts: One way to classify agents in a multiagent system is with respect to the degree and depth to which agents attempt to reason about each other. Vidal and Durfee's concept of a k-level agent <ref> [25] </ref> can be described inductively, roughly as follows: * A 0-level agent does not reason directly about others. * A 1-level agent forms models of other agents as 0-level agents. * A k-level agent forms models of other agents as (k 1)-level agents.
