Title: Diagnostic Evaluation of Shallow Parsing Through an Annotated Reference Corpus  
Author: Judith Klein, Stephan Busemann, and Thierry Declerck 
Address: Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3, 66123 Saarbrucken (Germany)  
Affiliation: German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)  
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a diagnostic tool, implemented as an annotated e-mail corpus database, for the evaluation of the analysis component of a German dialogue system, which has been realized as a NL front end to autonomous agent systems for appointment scheduling that use e-mail as their communication means. A shallow parsing approach has been adopted as the NL server's module. Methodology and measures applied for the evaluation must be understood in the context of the role played by the NL component within the overall system.

Reference-contexts: The e-mails were selected from a collection of several hundred e-mails dealing with appointment information. In total, 240 domain-relevant email fragments have been annotated. The annotation work is based on the TSNLP guidelines for the annotation of test material for NLP systems <ref> [ Lehmann et al., 1996 ] </ref> . The annotations mainly comprise structural information, functor-argument dependencies and information on verb frames. While the syntactic annotations of TSNLP could be used as is, application-specific refinements according to temporal expressions and information on negation, mode and modality had to be added.

Reference-contexts: various categories | followed by basic phenomena including different verbal subcategorizations, local and thematic PPs and the verbal complex are given highest scoring for performance measures in the evaluation. 3 Shallow-Parsing in COSMA The syntactic analysis of the e-mails has been carried out with the Saarbrucker Message Extraction System (smes) <ref> [ Neumann et al., 1997 ] </ref> , which combines a core engine for shallow processing and a user-defined system of finite state automata defining the grammar.
