Abstract: Users with no specialized computer training are often discouraged by the complex syntax of query languages and the output of long tables of alphanumerical values. The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory has recently developed the concept of dynamic queries which allows user control of animated visual displays of information. Experiments with our first applications have shown that dynamic queries can help reveal trends or global properties as well as assist users in answering specific questions. We present a new application developed with the National Center for Health Statistics and running on a simple PC. A thematic map of the United States is animated by adjusting sliders displayed on the side of the map. A time slider illustrates time trends. The other sliders control the filtering out of areas of the map according to parameters such as demographics. Detailed data about a particular area is obtained by clicking directly on its location on the map. We have received encouraging feedback from users. We also hypothesize that this new tool will facilitate the finding of confounders. apparent from tabular statistics. Printed atlases such as the Atlas of U.S. Cancer Mortality [1] have triggered many important studies. As a result of the rapid advancement of computer technology, maps are playing an increasing role in the presentation of statistical information as they can be produced in a small fraction of the time it took before One of the drawbacks of a map printed on paper or in an atlas is that the access to detail and exact values is lost. Since all values are split in only a few categories (i.e. 5 colors for a grouping in quintiles) users still have to refer to tables in order to access the exact rate in an area. Research on map graphic design (e.g.. [2]) shows that careful graphic design allow the tuning of the map to favor cluster identification or point value estimates, but printed maps have to select a single middleground design. Graphical Information Systems (GIS) are increasingly being used. They are powerful tools for preparing and printing maps but remain complex to use (i.e. difficult to master for people with no computer training). Producing a map requires typing or selecting many options and parameters then waiting for the map to appear. GIS are aimed at the production of the "best possible map" to show the result of a study or to illustrate a fact probably discovered another way. So far they are not appropriate for the rapid browsing between maps which is necessary for the exploration and hypothesis formulation tasks. In addition, GIS do not include query mechanisms. Showing trends Epidemiology often involves the study of time trends (to look at diseases spread, effect of treatment etc.) Beside the usual tabular displays this can be done by showing series of maps. For example Carat and Valleron report a study of the spread of an influenza-like illness in France by a series of six maps showing the extent of the sickness at six time points [3]. Specialized software (such as Macromind Director) allow canned animations to be prepared in advance. For maps tools
