Title: Towards a Qualitative Theory of Movement  
Author: Antony Galton 
Address: Exeter EX4 4PT, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: The phenomenon of movement arises whenever the same object occupies different positions in space at different times. Therefore a theory of movement must contain theories of time, space, objects, and position. We provide a theoretical basis for describing movement events in terms of the conditions for their occurrence, which refer to the holding or not holding of various positional fluents at different times. For this we need to bring together a formal model of time with a formal model of space. By attending closely to the constraints imposed by continuity on the temporal behaviour of different fluents we develop theory of dominance, which enables us to generate ab initio the perturbation relation on the full set of positional relations.

Reference-contexts: We can define further relations on intervals as follows. We use infix notation after the fashion of <ref> (Allen 1983) </ref>: iOj = 9i 0 ; j 0 ; k (i = i 0 + k ^ j = k + j 0 ) D iDj = 9k; l [j = k + i + l] D i &lt; j = iSj _ iDj _ iF j D (O; S;

Reference-contexts: We write Holds-at (S; t) to indicate that state S holds at instant t, and Holds (S; i) to indicate that S holds throughout the interval i <ref> (Allen 1984, Galton 1990) </ref>. These two notations are connected by the rule Holds (S; i) $ 8t&lt;iHolds-at (S; t); which says that a state holds throughout an interval if and only if it holds at every instant which divides the interval.

Reference-contexts: TPP A is a tangential proper part of B NTPP A is a non-tangential proper part of B TPPI A has B as a tangential proper part NTPPI A has B as a non-tangential proper part These eight relations correspond closely to the eight relations determined by Egenhofer's 4-intersection method <ref> (Egenhofer 1991) </ref>. Regions will be mainly of interest to us as possible positions for movable bodies. The position of a body can be given, with greater or less precision, by the RCC-8 relation which it bears to some known region, such as the position of another body.

Reference-contexts: There is considerable scope for further research in investigation of the dominance structure of other qualitative spaces in the literature on spatial reasoning, as for example the orientation-based system of <ref> (Freksa 1992) </ref>. With regard to the work presented in this paper, an intriguing open question remains. Our theory of dominance depends on our being able to speak meaningfully of a state holding at an instant.

Reference-contexts: This is the example used to criticise Allen in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. Suppose the whole movement takes up interval ht 1 ; t 3 i. The part of the movement during which a moves from p to q must occupy some initial interval of this, say ht 1 ; t 2 i.

Reference-contexts: Our paradigm for analysing movement will be to specify a movement event e in terms of its occurrence conditions, that is in terms of a formula of one of the forms Occurs (e; i) D Occurs-at (e; t) D where the right-hand side is a formula not containing e <ref> (Galton 1993, Galton 1994) </ref>. We shall consider a number of examples. Suppose we wish to define what it is for a to move from position r 1 to position r 2 over the interval i.

Reference-contexts: Since we are deal ing with dominance spaces, information regarding dominance also provides complete information about perturbation as well. In the next section we illustrate this with two examples of particular relevance to the present study. Further examples can be found in <ref> (Galton 1995) </ref>. 6 Applications to Spatial Change We can construct RCC-8 as a dominance space by noting that the RCC-8 relations are uniquely determined by knowing (a) whether all, some, or none of A is inside B, (b) whether all, some, or none of B is inside A, and (c) whether

Reference-contexts: Response 1 (a) is interesting because it has become prominent in AI, largely owing to the influence of Allen. Allen's work was prefigured by that of Hamblin in philosophy <ref> (Hamblin 1969, Hamblin 1971) </ref>. Hamblin was very much motivated by the dividing instant problem.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the later material on continuity and the theory of dominance applies specifically to dense time, and does not make much sense in the discrete case. 5 3 Movements and their Occurrence Conditions We use the RCC-8 system <ref> (Randell, Cui and Cohn 1992) </ref> for specifying relations between regions. <p> A clearer view of the dominance space can be obtained by deleting all the `impossible' nodes and rearranging those that remain as in Figure 2. It is reassuring to note that this diagram is identical, apart from the addition of the dominance arrows, to that of <ref> (Randell et al. 1992) </ref>! From this figure we can read off, for example, that a transition between DC and PO must involve passing through EC, though since this dominates both its neighbours the intermediate state need only hold for an instant.

Reference-contexts: There is an asymmetry between the states represented by `a is at r' and `a is not at r', which could be expressed by saying that the former must be true on closed sets of instants, the latter on open sets (compare the continuity rule of <ref> (Williams 1990) </ref>). In the somewhat infelicitous terminology of Galton (1990), `a is at r' is a state of position whereas `a is not at r' is a state of motion.
