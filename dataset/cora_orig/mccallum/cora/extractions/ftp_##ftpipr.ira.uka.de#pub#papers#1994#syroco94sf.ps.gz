Abstract: In this paper a new control system for the intelligent force control of multifinge-red robot grips is presented. The multilevel system architecture combines both fuzzy-based and a neural-based control algorithms. After defining the fine manipulation problem fuzzy and neural controller are developed. The demands of flexibility and real-time control of the implementation of the control system are suited by a tailorable parallel computer concept. The basic ideas of the concept are to set up each processing element and the communication individually for its application

Reference-contexts: Its design is specific to the number of fingers of the gripper in our case for a three-fingered-gripper. For every other multifingered-hand you have to change the design. For the Karlsruhe Hand, the three-fingered gripper developed at our institute <ref> (Doll, 1989) </ref>, the controller has six input values (a normal and tangential components for each of the three fingers) and one output value DN for all fingers.

Reference-contexts: One reason for this is that the tolerances of the objects, which have to be assembled in industry, are stricter than the accuracy of the used robots and their grippers. For the grasp control of an intelligent robot a common multilevel control system architecture has already been considered <ref> (Fatikow and Whlke, 1993) </ref>. The result is a new concept for task planning and control that combines the specific advantages of fuzzy logic and neural network approaches. Two kinds of a fuzzy controller are presented which can be integrated into this control architecture.

Reference-contexts: The control strategy of the grasp controller is that the resultant force in the contact point must lie inside the friction cone and DN has not become to big. The simulated results of the fuzzy controller show their performance in handling the uncertainties of the peg-in-hole task <ref> (Streit, 1993) </ref>. A comparison of the two designed controllers is shown in Table 1 (Dx horizontal deviation, DQ angle of the vertical deviation). It shows the maximum tolerated positioning errors. The performance of the finger controller is better than that of the grasp controller.

Reference-contexts: Training data have been generated by the successive simulation of finger forces, followed by the determination of the corresponding holding forces as the desired output of the network <ref> (Sundermann, 1993) </ref>, see Fig. 5. The force control ability of the fuzzy and neural controller have been analysed by using the simulation system for the peg-in-hole insertion task.
