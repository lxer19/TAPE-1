Abstract: A prototype system has been developed for diagnosing problems in software that controls computer networks. Techniques for model-based diagnosis that have been used successfully in physical systems are applied and extended to computer network software. Our approach divides this software into its natural hierarchy of layers, subdividing each layer into three separately modeled components: the interface to the layer above on the same machine, the protocol to the same layer on a remote machine, and the configuration. This paper presents a case study illustrating the diagnosis of some configuration problems involving the widely used FTP and DNS network software. Our approach considers diagnosis as a dynamic partial constraint satisfaction problem. Activity constraints are used to interface the model with the "real world" of the network, allowing the model to dynamically obtain data from the network and to use that data to change the problem as the search for a solution progresses. The partial solutions discovered by our system constitute the diagnosis. This work concentrates on modeling the network infrastructure itself. We believe it gives us a solid foundation for understanding basic problems that occur at all levels in information networks, and that the techniques we have developed are applicable at higher levels as well.

Reference-contexts: The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is a set of procedures used to map DNS names to IP addresses and vice versa <ref> (Albitz & Liu 1994) </ref>. It consists of a number of server daemons running at various locations in the Internet, each with the responsibility of resolving a subset of the names. On OSF/1 (DEC 1993) a name is resolved as follows: 1.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the error messages from the system are usually so general and vague that little can be gleaned from them as to the exact cause of (and hence the fix to) the problem. Techniques for model-based diagnosis have been used successfully in the diagnosis of physical systems <ref> (Hamscher, Console, & de Kleer 1992) </ref>. We have applied and extended this approach to computer network software. We consider this software to be constructed in a hierarchy of layers fashion as described in the ISO OSI Reference Model (ISO 1992). <p> file are not valid IP addresses and the resolver fails trying to contact them. name server Background Model-based Diagnosis as Partial Constraint Satisfaction Model-based diagnosis techniques compare observations of the behavior of a system being diagnosed to predictions based upon a model of the system in order to diagnose faults <ref> (Hamscher, Console, & de Kleer 1992) </ref>. The fundamental presumption behind model-based diagnosis is that, assuming the model is correct, all the inconsistencies between observation and prediction arise from faults in the system.

Reference-contexts: Programs that interface with users therefore have to map names to numbers, and vice versa. Programs that utilize networking need to map between the names used by people to refer to host computers and the IP addresses (numbers) used to communicate over the network. The Domain Name Service (DNS) <ref> (Mockapetris 1987) </ref> consists of a method for constructing names of host computers in a hierarchical manner and a way to resolve these names in a distributed fashion.

Regarding the interacting components of the system as constraints, and faulty components as failed constraints, minimal diagnoses naturally correspond to PCSP solutions that leave minimal sets of constraints unsatisfied. These sets are minimal in that there is no solution which leaves only a proper subset unsatisfied. <p> Second, since we are trying to solve a diagnosis problem which might have no complete solution, the (partial) solution we accept may violate some of the constraints, but we are still looking for an optimal solution, according to some criterion (e.g. minimal number of violated constraints), as presented in <ref> (Sabin et al. 1994) </ref>. Model Specification Studying name service configuration and modeling it using the DCSP formalism, we found out that quite a simple language is sufficient for specifying the associated dynamic constraint satisfaction problem.
