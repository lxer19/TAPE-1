Abstract: The asymptotic performance of Reed-Solomon coded M-ary orthogonal signaling with ratio-threshold test (RTT) type demodulation in a Rayleigh fading channel is considered. We show that the minimum E b =N 0 needed for error-free communication is e ln 2 (2.75 dB) with RTT, and 4.79 (6.8 dB) with hard decisions. The optimum code rate that minimizes the required E b =N 0 is e 1 with RTT and 0.46 with hard decision, and the optimum ratio threshold approaches 1 for large M . Next, we investigate the fundamental limit in direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS/SSMA) system employing an M-ary orthogonal code of length N = M m, which is obtained by spreading every row of an MxM Hadamard matrix with a user-specific random sequence of length N . We derive the minimum E b =N 0 for error-free communication as a function of the number of users, the optimum code rate that minimizes E b =N 0 , and the maximum limit on the 1 This research was supported in part by the Army Research Office under Grant DAAH04-95-1-0246

Reference-contexts: There are a number of methods for generating side information, and their performances have been analyzed in [1-3]. In this paper, we consider the ratio threshold test (RTT) <ref> [3] </ref> as a method for generating an information on the quality of the channel. RTT declares an erasure whenever the ratio of the largest to the second largest of the energy detector outputs does not exceed a fixed threshold greater than one.
