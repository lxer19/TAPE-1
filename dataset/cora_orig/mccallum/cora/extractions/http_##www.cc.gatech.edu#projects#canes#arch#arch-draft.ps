Title: Architectural Framework for Active Networks AN Working Group  
Date: July 3, 1998  
Abstract: This memo defines an architectural model for active networks. It defines the assumptions and goals for the active network and describes the functionality of each node. The approach specifies a set of basic functions from which the end-to-end abstractions presented to the user are implemented.

Reference-contexts: For example, a miss generated by a packet could be forwarded to the node that last processed the packet, as is done in [ANTS]. Another possibility is to allow the user code to handle the loading explicitly <ref> [SANE] </ref>. The number and nature of common abstractions to be supported is an issue for further research. 9 Evolution Strategy As experience is gained with active network applications and infrastructure, it will become clear which features are generally useful. <p> Helpful inputs on this version were also provided by Bobby Bhattacharjee and Sandy Murphy.

Reference-contexts: The NodeOS presents this information to an enforcement engine, which verifies its authenticity and checks that the node's security policy database (see Figure 1) authorizes the principal to receive the requested service or perform the requested operation. A companion document <ref> [SecArch] </ref> describes the active network security architecture; see also Section 6. DRAFT 3 July 3, 1998 Each node has a distinguished management execution environment, through which certain aspects of the node configuration may be controlled. <p> Moreover, the range of values to be specified is likely to be extensive. Therefore a logarithmic metric is recommended for measures of memory and computation. 8.2.2 Security Credentials The node OS must pass security information (e.g. public-key certificates) to components of the security architecture <ref> [SecArch] </ref>. A standard syntax and semantics for such information is needed. DRAFT 12 July 3, 1998 8.3 Common Objects and Services The Node OS may, in the interest of efficiency, support certain common abstractions that can be used by any environment.

Reference-contexts: One possibility is to allow an environment to specify a "thunk" to be executed whenever it incurs a "miss" on the (common) object store. For example, a miss generated by a packet could be forwarded to the node that last processed the packet, as is done in <ref> [ANTS] </ref>.
