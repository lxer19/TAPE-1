Title: Datalog and TwoGroups and C++

Abstract: Datalog is the language of deductive databases, a first step towards intelligent relational databases. TwoGroups is a database of p-groups, primarily the groups of order dividing 2 8 , which has seen actually use by research mathematicians. TwoGroups was originally developed on the NU-Prolog platform. We report on our efforts to implement a Datalog interpreter in C++, and to implement TwoGroups in C++ on top of the Datalog platform. Although TwoGroups is very relational in style, its use of range queries means that Datalog is not the perfect platform on which to implement TwoGroups. However, TwoGroups can directly utilise the multi-attribute retrieval algorithms within the Datalog implementation which do support range queries.

Reference-contexts: The collections are searched or queried in much the same fashion as the printed literature. The libraries of group data for the computer algebra systems Cayley and GAP are used in the same manner as these on-line collections of files. TwoGroups is the first mathematical database. SmallSimpleGroups <ref> [4] </ref> is the first knowledge base for mathematics, though still experimental. It contains objects, parameterised data, and heuristics. Fig. 1.

A formal treatment of Datalog semantics, and the optimi-sation of Datalog queries can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. The major aim of optimization of Datalog queries is to eliminate recursion in the rules, so that retrieval from the database of facts is not repeated unnecessarily. Proplog handles propositional calculus, which has constants but not variables. Datalog handles predicate calculus, which allows variables for attribute values.

For an attribute without an index, a search must be performed. Index data structures for single attribute retrieval have been well-studied, and are usually based on hashing or B-trees.

Reference-contexts: Proplog handles propositional calculus, which has constants but not variables. Datalog handles predicate calculus, which allows variables for attribute values. These are implicitly quantified: universally quantified in the head of a rule, and existentially quantified in the body of a rule. An object model <ref> [25] </ref> of the language concepts is presented in Figure 3. The DDL (Data Definition Language) allows the definition of rules and facts as clauses. The DML (Data Manipulation Language) only allows queries, which are posed as (headless) clauses: that is, as a list of literals.
