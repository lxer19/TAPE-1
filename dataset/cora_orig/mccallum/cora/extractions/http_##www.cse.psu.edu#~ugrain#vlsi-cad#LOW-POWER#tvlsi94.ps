Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider only those bases which are powers of 2. The use of SD numbers allows addition to be performed in constant time by restricting carry propagation to at most one digit position <ref> [2] </ref>. Each SD is encoded using a 2's complement encoding, where each SD occupies n = dlog re + 1 bits. To represent an N-bit number, k = dN=(n 1)e SDs are required. The SD addition algorithm is given in Table 1 [2]. of the SD addition algorithm involves the sign <p> carry propagation to at most one digit position <ref> [2] </ref>. Each SD is encoded using a 2's complement encoding, where each SD occupies n = dlog re + 1 bits. To represent an N-bit number, k = dN=(n 1)e SDs are required. The SD addition algorithm is given in Table 1 [2]. of the SD addition algorithm involves the sign extended addition of two n-bit SDs. The advantage of using a 2's complement encoding is that digit addition can be done using a simple n-bit RCA - module A1.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results showed that Perflex can significantly improve the timing of a circuit while the layout area is kept comparable to that obtained when the layout is optimized for area. A 286-transistor 8-bit adder description based on gates from the MisII standard-cell library <ref> [3] </ref> was given as input to both Timberwolf-SC4 [18] and Perflex. HSPICE [17] simulations showed that the layouts generated by Perflex were better in all respects of maximum signal delay, layout area and power consumption. Hence we decided to use Perflex.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The three most widely accepted metrics for measuring the quality of a circuit are area, delay and power. Minimizing area and delay has always been considered important, but reducing power consumption has been gaining prominence recently <ref> [8, 7, 6, 5] </ref>. This can be attributed to the increasing popularity of mobile communication systems. Since dramatic improvements in battery technology are not foreseen, low-power designs are crucial not only to lighten the overall weight, but also to reduce the time between recharges. <p> Among the SDAs, SDA-4 has the least delay and the delay of the SDA increases with the base since the digit addition carry chains become progressively longer. The estimation of power dissipation of a circuit is a difficult problem and has received a lot of attention <ref> [5, 10, 11, 13] </ref>. HSPICE can measure the power consumed by a circuit given a set of inputs. But the power dissipation is a strong function of the inputs. The node voltages of each Table 4. <p> The height of the power curve was recorded as the maximum instantaneous power dissipation of the circuit. Since the inputs are independent, power can be approximated to be normally distributed <ref> [5] </ref>.

The choice of the addition algorithm significantly affects p f , the activity factor of a circuit [8]. Reference <ref> [6] </ref> compares the power consumption of some CMOS adders. But they do not size transistors whereas practical circuits usually employ transistor sizing to improve speed. Further estimating the power consumption of signed-digit adders has not been done before. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: 1670 2 Average power dissipation 109.904 mW 70.066 mW Max instantaneous dissipation 33.729 mW 29.418 mW Worst case delay 12.585 ns 12.625 ns Power fi Delay 1:383142 fi 10 9 0:884578 fi 10 9 The transistor sizing algorithm used in Perflex is the posynomial programming approach used in AT&T's TILOS <ref> [12] </ref>. But in the TILOS heuristic, transistors are sized only as a preprocessing step to the layout process whereas in Perflex sizing is done repeatedly as the simulated-annealing layout optimizer slowly solidifies the gate placement to the final one. This allows transistors to be sized more optimally.

Reference-contexts: Since, in the worst case, the carry can propagate from the least significant bit position to the most significant bit position, the addition time of an N-bit RCA is O (N ). 2.2 Blocked Carry Lookahead Adder We use the structure of the "ELM" blocked carry lookahead adder (BCLA) <ref> [14] </ref>. Compared to the Brent and Kung [4] adder, the ELM adder occupies the same area (O (N log N )), but uses fewer interconnects (2N log N + N as opposed to 3N log N ).

Reference-contexts: A 286-transistor 8-bit adder description based on gates from the MisII standard-cell library [3] was given as input to both Timberwolf-SC4 [18] and Perflex. HSPICE <ref> [17] </ref> simulations showed that the layouts generated by Perflex were better in all respects of maximum signal delay, layout area and power consumption. Hence we decided to use Perflex. <p> Table 3 lists their salient features. The layouts were then used to extract circuit equivalents for use in a detailed circuit simulation using HSPICE v. 93a <ref> [17] </ref> to obtain the power and delay measures. The transistor parameters used 7 were from a recent 1:2 MOSIS fabrication run and the simulations were carried out at 27 ffi C with an input frequency of 10 MHz.

Reference-contexts: But a comparison based on a level `playing field' was a prime consideration for our experiments and hence we decided to use the latter option. Among the automatic layout generation tools, we had to choose between standard cell place and route tools (for example, Timberwolf-SC4 <ref> [18] </ref>) and Perflex, an in-house performance driven module generator [15, 16].

Reference-contexts: Hence the mean power dissipation of the circuit is given by x t c s p , where x is the sample mean, s is the standard deviation, N is the number of samples and t c is obtained from the t-distribution for c% confidence interval <ref> [19] </ref>. (For 95% confidence, t c = 1:9647 for N = 500.) Similarly the power-delay product is also computed. The power measures for the seven adders are shown in Table 4. Figures 5 and 6 show the probability distribution of the power dissipation and power-delay product, respectively.
