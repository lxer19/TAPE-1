Abstract: 6 and the rest of the SDSC crew for help getting the hardware and software set up at IETF; Steve Coya and Megan Davies for logistics; and Van Jacobson for work on vat and help in searching for the packet losses. Walt Prue set up a special route for the tunnel from San Diego to DART-net at ISI, and Milo Medin and Jeff Burgan set up a connection from DARTnet to FIX-West for a clear shot to Hawaii and Australia. We also thank the remote vat participants for their help as guinea pigs during testing. Simon Hackett in Ade-laide had to get up very early in the morning; Ian Wake-man and Jon Crowcroft in London, along with Anders Klemets and Steve Pink in Stockholm, had to stay up late at night. This points out one impediment to distributing the IETF that will be hard to fix: too many time zones! A pre-release of the LBL audio tool vat is available by anonymous FTP from ftp.ee.lbl.gov in the file vat.tar.Z. Included are a binary suitable for use on any version of Sparcstation and a manual entry. The authors of vat say the source will be released soon. You don't need kernel sources to add multicast support. Pick up the file vmtp-ip/ipmulti-sunos411.tar.Z by anonymous FTP from gregorio.stanford.edu. It contains the IP multicast code to be added to a SunOS 4.1.1 kernel. Once you build the kernel, you should use adb to permanently patch the kernel variable audio_79C30_bsize from the standard value of 1024 to be 180 decimal to match the audio packet size for minimum delay. Otherwise there will be bad breakup when sound from two sites gets mixed for playback. The current work on protocols for packet audio and video transport over UDP is considered experimental because UDP transmission is only sufficient for small-scale use over fast portions of the Internet. If many people tried to send packet audio today, significant network congestion would likely result. Since packet audio does not practice congestion control, well-behaved TCP traffic would back off and let the audio take over which is probably not fair. Even so, when there is congestion, the resulting packet loss would impair the audio quality as well. Research is underway on DARTnet and elsewhere to develop resource management (or traffic control) algorithms to solve this problem [5,6,7]. These algorithms, running in the various levels of packet switches in the network, would give priority to real-time traffic such as audio and video to achieve low delay and packet loss. At the same time, the algorithms would prevent real-time traffic from using more than its fair share, as determined by payment or policy. On small links with a low degree of multiplexing, new calls may be blocked when there is insufficient capacity to avoid degrading interference with established calls. The audio/video transport protocols may be used in conjunction with other protocols such as ST-II [8] or connectionless resource setup protocols to access the resource management functions. A big part of the effort required to set up this IETF audio-cast was in constructing the virtual network of multicast tunnels by hand and testing its performance. The tunnel mechanism in mrouted was only intended for experimental support of internet multicasting, pending widespread support for multicast routing by the regular routers. We need multicast routing in the real networks to reduce the setup effort and make the routing more robust. To reach the goal of ubiquitous support for multicast-ing, more work on multicast routing protocols is needed. Mrouted suffers from the well-known scaling problems of any distance-vector routing protocol, and does not support hierarchical multicast routing or interoperation with other multicast routing protocols. Multicast extensions are being tested for the OPSF [9] and BGP [10] routing protocols, but complete coverage will likely require the design of a hierarchical scheme incorporating these and other protocols. IP multicast addressing works well for broadcast-type applications such as this audiocast where a priori agreements on addressing and media encoding can be made. A predefined multicast address and UDP port number are built in to vat, so to join in one can just start listening. To expand from a single broadcast to multiple, private teleconferences, connection/session management protocols will be required to request call acceptance, negotiate compatible encodings, dynamically allocate IP multicast addresses, etc. Since IP multicast traffic may be received by anyone, the control protocols must handle authentication and key exchange so that the audio/video data can be encrypted. Like resource management, connection management is the subject of current research. We expect that standards-track protocols integrating transport, resource management, and connection management will be the result of later IETF working group efforts. The first IETF audiocast was an interesting and valuable experiment both for the experimenters and the participants. Though there were some problems, the results were good enough to suggest that the experiment be continued for future IETF meetings. There are several open issues that provide promising areas for additional work: We thank Allison Mankin for suggesting the idea of the IETF audiocast. Many people helped to make the audio-cast work. We particularly thank Paul Love, Tom Hutton w better real-time performance measurement tools
