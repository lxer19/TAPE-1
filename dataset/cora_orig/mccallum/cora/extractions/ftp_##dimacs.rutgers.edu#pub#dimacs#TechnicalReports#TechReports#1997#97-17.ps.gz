Abstract: The construction of evolutionary trees is a fundamental problem in biology, and yet methods for reconstructing evolutionary trees are not reliable when it comes to inferring accurate topologies of large divergent evolutionary trees from realistic length sequences. We address this problem and present a new polynomial time algorithm for reconstructing evolutionary trees called the Short Quartets Method which is consistent and which has greater statistical power than other polynomial time methods, such as Neighbor-Joining and the 3-approximation algorithm by Agarwala et al. (and the "Double Pivot" variant of the Agarwala et al. algorithm by Cohen and Farach) for the L 1 -nearest tree problem. Our study indicates that our method will produce the correct topology from shorter sequences than can be guaranteed using these other methods.

Reference-contexts: We will say that a distance-based method is reasonable if it is both combinatorially consistent and continuous at every additive distance matrix defining a binary tree. An interesting characterization of additive matrices D is the following: Theorem 2. Four Point Condition, from <ref> [4] </ref>: A distance matrix D is an additive matrix if and only if for all i; j; k; l, of the three pairwise sums D ij + D kl ; D ik + D jl ; D il + D jk , the largest two are identical.

Reference-contexts: Construct the tree (if it exists) consistent with all the constraints on the topologies of quartets. If no tree exists consistent with all the constraints, output a star tree. (A similar procedure was described by Fitch in <ref> [9] </ref>.) Constructing a tree consistent with all quartet topologies is easily done in polynomial time through a variety of techniques, hence this is a polynomial time method. We now present a comparison of various distance based methods based upon topology invariant neighborhoods. Theorem 4.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Evolutionary trees indicate how species evolved from a common ancestor and are of fundamental concern to biologists. There are many methods for reconstructing trees from biomolecular sequences, and all potentially competitive methods are evaluated according to their accuracy for topology prediction <ref> [11] </ref>. However, reconstructing this topology is a difficult task for at least two reasons. First, all accepted optimization problems in this area are NP-hard, so that methods which are efficient typically do not provide good performance on large sets of sequences.

Reference-contexts: The importance to biologists of this measure of accuracy (called efficiency or power in the systematic biology literature [14]) is reflected in the extensive performance analysis literature in systematic biology in which methods are analyzed according to their performance on model tree reconstruction under various stochastic models of evolution <ref> [12] </ref>. Initially these studies focused on consistency [7], i.e. the question of whether a method would be guaranteed to produce the correct topology given long enough sequences.

Reference-contexts: Initially these studies focused on consistency [7], i.e. the question of whether a method would be guaranteed to produce the correct topology given long enough sequences. Since the discovery around 1970 <ref> [13] </ref> of consistent distance transformations (which produce "corrected distances"), it has been clear that all reasonable distance-based methods can recover the true tree with high probability given long enough sequences when applied to corrected distances computed on sequences generated by binary trees.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the sequence length needed by a method imposes a significantly more severe limitation than its computational requirements. The importance to biologists of this measure of accuracy (called efficiency or power in the systematic biology literature <ref> [14] </ref>) is reflected in the extensive performance analysis literature in systematic biology in which methods are analyzed according to their performance on model tree reconstruction under various stochastic models of evolution [12].

Reference-contexts: Instead, we attempt to construct topologies only on those quartets that are close within the tree; these are called the short quartets. The reconstruction of the tree from these short quartets involves solving a special case of a problem which is in its general form NP-complete <ref> [15] </ref>. The method we use to reconstruct the topology on each quartet is not specified; if we can afford the time, we may elect to use maximum likelihood which has great statistical power, but which is computationally too expensive to use for all but small trees.
