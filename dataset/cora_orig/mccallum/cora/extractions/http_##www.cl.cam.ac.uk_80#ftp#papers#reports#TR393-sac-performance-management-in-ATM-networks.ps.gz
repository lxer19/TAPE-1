Reference-contexts: For a given set of parameters QLT and MLT can compromise between the loss of delay sensitive traffic and the delay of delay insensitive traffic. Whilst MLT performs better, QLT is favoured for its ease of implementation. Aawater and Schoute <ref> [Aawater91] </ref> have shown that the optimal set of priority based policies which balance low loss with low delay are the set of QLT policies with different values of the threshold parameter. Two other algorithms of interest are FIFO+ [Clark92] and Hop Laxity Threshold (HLT) [Schulzrinne94].

Reference-contexts: Previous implementations of MSNA [Dixon92, McAuley90] have combined the functions user and control planes into a single functional unit, normally bound within the operating system kernel of a host or network gateway in a system specific manner (following the example of Unix [Le*er89] and Mach <ref> [Accetta86] </ref>). This makes the management of multiprocessor systems such as the Fairisle switch difficult, because it assumes that each processor (kernel) is responsible for its own management.

Reference-contexts: Many candidate CAC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, for example <ref> [Ahmadi90, Kelly91, Gibbens95] </ref>. Details of the CAC algorithm are beyond the scope of this dissertation; some initial work on CAC using Fairisle is reported in [Crosby95]. In addition to making the CAC decision, resource allocation decisions must be made at lower layers.

Reference-contexts: Whilst the former is attractive, it has a cost which grows with the square of the switch size. Two distributed algorithms for scheduling the fabric (which require hardware support for efficient implementation) are proposed in <ref> [Anderson92] </ref>. The first, called "parallel iterative matching", iteratively matches inputs with outputs in a pseudo-random fashion. It can be shown to find a maximal match of inputs to outputs in logarithmic time, and to guarantee fairness. Because of its random nature, however, the algorithm cannot bound the cell queueing time.

Reference-contexts: It is important that the development of broadband communications does not follow this route. 1.3.2.4 The Distributed Systems Approach Many of the problems which the ITU-T standards have attempted to address have already been solved by advanced distributed systems architectures, such as ANSA <ref> [ANSA89, ANSA92] </ref> and others. In such architectures service interfaces, the procedures they export, and the data types they use are strongly typed. Each service instance exports a unique interface reference representing its service offer, and a federated "trading" environment allows prospective clients to obtain service offers which match their requirements. <p> The MSRPC2 runtime was developed by the author and the user interface by Timothy Roscoe, 21 the author, and Richard Hayton of the Computer Laboratory. It is based on as-pects of the ANSA <ref> [ANSA89] </ref> Computational Model and the DEC SRC Network Objects system [Birrell94]. It differs fundamentally from them at the low level in that it is extremely lightweight: bindings are implicitly single-threaded and have a one-to-one correspondence with MSNL liaisons. <p> The call procedures identify all valid sequences of state transitions at the UUMI and MUMI in response to inputs from the interface and environment. Interface description languages such as MIDDL, ANSA IDL <ref> [ANSA89] </ref>, CORBA IDL [OMG91] and the OSF DCE [OSF92] permit the definition of data types which cross the interface, operations which are offered by the server, and exceptions which may be raised. <p> The TINA architecture is based on well understood principles of distributed computing, and has built on the CORBA [OMG91], ANSA <ref> [ANSA89] </ref> and ODP [ITU-T92a] principles, whilst preserving compatibility with ITU-T standards. The architecture is broken down into four components: the computing, service, management and network architectures. The computing architecture uses the OSF Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) [OSF92] to define an object-based model for computation, communications services and management.

Reference-contexts: It is now widely accepted that the signalling procedures should be located in an Out of Band (OB) control plane, for reasons of performance and efficiency. Current OB signalling protocols, including draft signalling standards for ATM such as those defined and standardized by the ITU-T [ITU-T94a] and ATM Forum <ref> [ATMF94] </ref>, are complex and inflexible. This results from their origins in existing message-based ISDN signalling protocols which assume that all services are embedded within the network, under control of a single provider. <p> The call procedures in this protocol are inadequate for ATM networks, however, with the result that Recommendation Q.2931 [ITU-T94a], and extensions, also known as DSS 2, are being developed. The ATM Forum UNI <ref> [ATMF94] </ref> is a similar protocol aligned as far as possible with DSS 2, but with some simplified procedures, and a broader set of connection services. Details of the differences between the two can be found in [Stiller95].

Reference-contexts: Because of this, results for only two sources are presented. 4 Other definitions use the variance to mean ratio or mean burst length <ref> [Bae91] </ref>. 104 where ref is the load placed on the link by the reference connection. <p> An improvement of several orders of magnitude in the loss rate of delay-sensitive traffic (due to lateness) can be achieved with only a small performance penalty for the loss insensitive traffic if the proportion of priority traffic is low <ref> [Bae91] </ref>. 1 This is being done by Naeem Khan at the Computer Laboratory. 143 8.3.1.1 Deadline Schedulers An alternative is to use priorities which vary in response to the traffic load.

Reference-contexts: Each interface contains input and output buffers which model RPC operations with asynchronous message passing. The UUMI and MUMI programs are composed to model the whole protocol using a connector. Full details of the model are given in [Cuellar94b], and a related paper <ref> [Barnard95] </ref>. A full TLT specification of the MUMI program is given in Appendix B. 4.4.4 Verification of the Design TLT includes a toolbox which enables rapid verification of TLT programs. The TLT specification of the UMI was verified using these tools by Dieter Barnard of Siemens Corporate Research and Development.

Reference-contexts: MSRPC2 thus cannot guarantee that a remote operation will be executed. As a 1 A reliable transport using TCP is also available. 22 result the only semantics supported when using an MSNL transport are At Most Once (AMO) <ref> [Birrell84] </ref> semantics.

Reference-contexts: The MSRPC2 runtime was developed by the author and the user interface by Timothy Roscoe, 21 the author, and Richard Hayton of the Computer Laboratory. It is based on as-pects of the ANSA [ANSA89] Computational Model and the DEC SRC Network Objects system <ref> [Birrell94] </ref>. It differs fundamentally from them at the low level in that it is extremely lightweight: bindings are implicitly single-threaded and have a one-to-one correspondence with MSNL liaisons. MSRPC2 also incorporates transparent optimisations for calls within a single address space which map invocations onto single procedure calls.

Reference-contexts: Section 5.1 describes the Unix implementation and comments on its performance. The Unix kernel implementation was performed by Richard Black of the Computer Laboratory, and is not described in detail. Details of both the master and the kernel support may be found in a joint paper <ref> [Black94a] </ref>. Section 5.2 describes the implementation of the UMI and SCI service interfaces within the Wanda micro-kernel, on a Fairisle port controller. <p> Although the UMI protocol permits the specification of user QoS requirements, such as the IP MTU, the current implementation uses 4 different MTU sizes to enable experimentation. Details of the IP implementation are to be found in <ref> [Black94a] </ref>. 5.1.6 Design of the User Space master The user space master implements the control and management planes for MSNA. It is responsible for routeing, MMI signalling (in the form of metasignalling) and communication with the control interfaces in the kernel.

Reference-contexts: Fairisle ATM Network Building on earlier ATM experience at Cambridge, including the Cambridge Fast Ring (CFR) [Hopper86], the Cambridge Backbone Network (CBN) [Greaves88] and the Cambridge Fast Packet Switch [Newman89], the Fairisle Project developed an experimental ATM platform to permit research into performance, architectural and management issues in ATM networks <ref> [Leslie91, Black94b] </ref>. Fairisle is based on a network architecture composed of ATM switches interconnected to form a general topology LAN; the Fairisle switch is a descendant of the Cam-bridge Fast Packet Switch. <p> The CDV is further influenced by two Fairisle-specific features: the fabric operates at a rate 1:2375 times higher than the line rate to partially overcome the head-of-line blocking problem <ref> [Black94b] </ref>. In addition a small output FIFO is used to accommodate the rate difference between the fabric and line. The FIFO applies back pressure across the fabric when half full, complicating the blocking mechanism. <p> This, in turn, requires a small degree of output buffering, which is provided by small output FIFO with space for approximately 5 cells <ref> [Black94b] </ref>. In spite of the speedup, it is impossible to bound the cell queueing delay, because the arbitration at each point of contention (the output of each switching stage and the fabric) is independent.

Reference-contexts: This enables them to behave intelligently in response to the received resource allocation. Three prototype implementations of the architecture have been implemented. Hyden [Hyden94] implemented a prototype system called NEMO, defining a QoS paradigm which enables the operating system to support continuous media. Black <ref> [Black95] </ref> used the Fairisle port controller as a platform for the development of Fawn, an operating system with support for explicit scheduling of network activity, and support for optimized I/O. <p> The two cases were pictured in Figure 3.7 which shows the principles underlying the CLS. Local liaisons also require resources at layers above MS-Access, typically CPU time and memory. This problem has been addressed by the Pegasus project, for example in the Fawn implementation <ref> [Black95] </ref>, and is beyond the scope of this dissertation. In both cases an active producer and consumer are required which inject cells into and eject cells from the CLS respectively. These are described below for the two cases of interest. <p> This is a drawback which can only be remedied either by scheduling a (periodic) method which forces the CLS to return control to Wanda, or by using 92 a non-work conserving policy. Fawn solves this problem by scheduling the Fairisle device driver as an application domain <ref> [Black95] </ref>. The overhead of FIQ interrupts is severe: measurements indicate that the latency from the instant of cell reception until it is transmitted into the fabric is typically 2 cell times (approximately 7:11s).

Reference-contexts: A nave approach would be to partition the buffer between the connections. This is similar to peak rate allocation of bandwidth, and requires large buffer 161 sizes [Kroner91]. Partial Buffer Sharing (PBS) <ref> [Hebuterne89, Petr90, Bonomi90] </ref> discriminates by class, assigning a maximum queue length to the delay sensitive traffic an arriving cell which finds its share of the buffer space full is discarded. There is no threshold associated with the loss sensitive traffic.

Reference-contexts: Recently the RACE EXPLOIT project has reported the practical validation of several analytical models of CDV <ref> [Brinkmann94, Louis94, Nellas94] </ref>. This work, however, suffers from several important drawbacks: first, the traffic is artificially generated to conform to the assumptions of the analytical models, and bears little relation to real ATM traffic.

Reference-contexts: There is no obvious way to integrate such systems into traditional network control architectures based on the ISDN approach. Support for multimedia applications has been addressed by extending the network signalling interface <ref> [Bubenick91, Minzer91, Heijenk94] </ref>, providing sophisticated call and connection management signalling services. These approaches go some way towards addressing the problems of network control, but result in extremely complicated interfaces which are very difficult to specify and verify. <p> This is unfortunate, since it is precisely the problems which they cause that it is designed to overcome. Also TINA-C has yet to address the problem of interaction with "dumb" multimedia devices, which are implicitly supported by the MSN-CMA. 4.5.4 Connection Management Access Protocol The CMAP proposal <ref> [Bubenick91, Bubenick92] </ref> is an ATM user-network signalling protocol featuring a rich set of signalling primitives: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint calls can be set up, managed and monitored.

Reference-contexts: a receiver distinguish messages received from two different senders? Multicast connections are complicated to set up, administer and control because they involve the determination and maintenance of the mul-ticast routeing tree [Doar93], membership eligibility tests, and require primitives to support solicited and unsolicited addition of new parties to the communication <ref> [Bubenick92] </ref>. 4.3.3.2 Fast Reservation Another possible feature is fast reservation, which allows a source to request resources for each traffic burst, waiting for permission from the network, and delaying transmission by a round-trip time [Doshi90]. <p> This is unfortunate, since it is precisely the problems which they cause that it is designed to overcome. Also TINA-C has yet to address the problem of interaction with "dumb" multimedia devices, which are implicitly supported by the MSN-CMA. 4.5.4 Connection Management Access Protocol The CMAP proposal <ref> [Bubenick91, Bubenick92] </ref> is an ATM user-network signalling protocol featuring a rich set of signalling primitives: point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint calls can be set up, managed and monitored.

Reference-contexts: Yet another variation on the deadline scheduler is the Oldest Customer First (OCF) policy: each packet carries a time stamp indicating its accumulated delay in the network, which is used by the scheduler to order transmission <ref> [Chen89] </ref>. Although optimal with regard to minimizing the maximum delay and maximising the minimum delay, all deadline-based algorithms require the customers to be sorted according to the deadline schedule. Computation of the schedule has high cost without appropriate hardware support.

Reference-contexts: Cells in queue 1 wait for service. HOL-PJ requires less computational overhead than EDD, but can satisfy any relative average delay requirements for different classes and approximately minimize the overall maximum tail probability in the system. Chipalkatti et al. <ref> [Chipalkatti89] </ref> proposed the Minimum Laxity Threshold (MLT) algorithm which transmits the delay sensitive cell with the least time remaining until its deadline, provided that its laxity is below some threshold. If no such cell exists then the delay insensitive traffic is given priority.

Reference-contexts: Characteristics Two VBR video sources were used as the two classes of traffic, namely an AVA video trace, and a trace of the "Starwars" movie. 8.5.2.1 The Starwars Data The Starwars data set was produced by Garrett and Vetterli at Bellcore, and has been studied in some detail, for example <ref> [Garrett94, Chong94, Crosby95] </ref>. It comprises the information content in bytes per frame for about 2 hours of the film, as transmitted by a DCT based codec similar to JPEG. The byte count per frame is broken down into "slices" of 16 video lines.

Reference-contexts: Stallings [Stallings89] identifies the need for a three-way handshake protocol when unreliability of the signalling network can cause confusion as to the state of 1 The design of the multicast service is due to Shaw Chuang of the Computer Laboratory, and will be described in detail in <ref> [Chuang95] </ref>. 58 a connection. In this case the use of RPC to implement the connection set up is unreliable because the MSNL Master has no way of knowing that the active user received its reply to the connect request.

Reference-contexts: This is true also of the UMI protocol in the MSN-CMA. An alternative mechanism has been proposed by Cidon et al. <ref> [Cidon93] </ref>, which aims to reduce the latency of the resource allocation phase of connection setup. The protocol supports fast bandwidth reservation, and guaranteed release of resources in the face of switch or link failures. Although designed for the Paris/plaNet network, it could also be used in the ATM context.

Reference-contexts: Aawater and Schoute [Aawater91] have shown that the optimal set of priority based policies which balance low loss with low delay are the set of QLT policies with different values of the threshold parameter. Two other algorithms of interest are FIFO+ <ref> [Clark92] </ref> and Hop Laxity Threshold (HLT) [Schulzrinne94]. Under FIFO+, each network node estimates the average delay for each class of traffic. Each packet is given a priority, on departing, which indicates its experienced delay relative to the average.

Reference-contexts: The network establishes a mapping between the VCI and state which is used to route cells through the network and allocate them transmission capacity. This contrasts with non-connection oriented networks, such as the IP-based Internet <ref> [Comer91] </ref>, in which no resource reservation is required before transmission. <p> One of the first things an entity must do is discover its own identity and then attempt to boot. The process of identity mapping is called the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) <ref> [Comer91] </ref>, and in MSNA is achieved using the metasignalling protocol. Thus, at the start-of-day, each entity must be able to metasignal 6 . A service not mentioned previously which is implemented by the MD is the RARP daemon, to which all RARP requests are forwarded.

Reference-contexts: Given a particular traffic mix, the CAC function must determine whether accepting a new connection will cause the QoS constraints of any of the connections to be violated, either on the basis of pre-computed [Kelly91] or measured data <ref> [Courcoubetis91, Crosby95] </ref>, or both [Gibbens95]. * Flow and congestion controls, (burst and cell scales). <p> First, how big should the buffers be? Queueing models can help to identify a size which guarantees a low probability of buffer overflow, but may not realistically reflect the queueing dynamics of real ATM traffic. Recent approaches based on dynamic measurement <ref> [Duffield95, Crosby95] </ref> are promising in this regard. Second, how should the buffer space be multiplexed between different connections? Static allocation is inefficient, but dynamic sharing risks domination by one class. When an arriving cell finds the buffer full, either it or a cell in the buffer must be discarded. <p> Many candidate CAC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, for example [Ahmadi90, Kelly91, Gibbens95]. Details of the CAC algorithm are beyond the scope of this dissertation; some initial work on CAC using Fairisle is reported in <ref> [Crosby95] </ref>. In addition to making the CAC decision, resource allocation decisions must be made at lower layers. Specific allocations of transmission resource and buffer space must be made within each CLS, according to the policy it implements. Correspondingly, policy-specific resource allocation functions must be implemented by the MSNL Master. <p> Characteristics Two VBR video sources were used as the two classes of traffic, namely an AVA video trace, and a trace of the "Starwars" movie. 8.5.2.1 The Starwars Data The Starwars data set was produced by Garrett and Vetterli at Bellcore, and has been studied in some detail, for example <ref> [Garrett94, Chong94, Crosby95] </ref>. It comprises the information content in bytes per frame for about 2 hours of the film, as transmitted by a DCT based codec similar to JPEG. The byte count per frame is broken down into "slices" of 16 video lines. <p> Additional work should aim to establish procedures for dynamically parameterising the algorithms in response to changes in the multiplexed load. Further use of the Fairisle CLS in a study of CAC algorithms is in progress; some results are reported in <ref> [Crosby95] </ref>. 174

Reference-contexts: the duplication of physical networks, and their inability to accommodate different modes of communication led to the search for a technology which could integrate multiple services. 1.3.1 The Asynchronous Transfer Mode The Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing (ATDM) technique, whose early developers included AT&T Bell Laboratories [Fraser93], Cambridge [Hopper78] and CNET <ref> [Devault88] </ref>, has become accepted as the best solution to the problem of integrating communications services. ATDM, now simply called ATM, borrows the best properties from each of two existing multiplexing mechanisms. From the Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM), ATM borrowed the notion of a fixed size unit of access.

Reference-contexts: The implementation available at the start of this research incorporated all MSNA functionality within the kernel.

Wanda is a single address space system, and supports lightweight threads, both within the kernel and in user space. <p> In order to successfully incorporate such devices into a multi-service network, proxy signalling is required whereby some other node signals on behalf of the device; the control path must be able to differ from the data path. Previous implementations of MSNA <ref> [Dixon92, McAuley90] </ref> have combined the functions user and control planes into a single functional unit, normally bound within the operating system kernel of a host or network gateway in a system specific manner (following the example of Unix [Le*er89] and Mach [Accetta86]). <p> (switched) 42.1 8.7 Table 5.1: Connection setup and teardown times The implementation performs worse than an earlier implementation of a (simpler) version of the control plane within the Unix kernel, for which average connection setup times of 3.5 ms were measured between two Unix hosts over a lightly loaded Ethernet <ref> [Dixon92] </ref>. Although it would be unreasonable to expect this implementation to perform as well as a more mature, though less functional, kernel implementation, better results might have been expected.

Reference-contexts: For some classes of application both the end-to-end delay and the jitter which result may affect their performance, requiring large playout buffers at the receiver. For video conferencing, for example, a maximum delay of approximately 20ms (half a frame time) is frequently cited <ref> [Frater94] </ref>. Furthermore, queueing delays can cause cells from a connection to become grouped together, artificially increasing the peak rate and making the traffic more bursty, violating its traffic parameters, and leading to buffer overflow. <p> Phrased differently, the loss probability for an arriving cell is a function of the burst size distribution of its traffic type. This means that bursty sources experience greater loss for the same load. Frater <ref> [Frater94] </ref> observed as a result of an analytical study that loss is determined by the weight of the tail of the queue length distribution for each class. In this case the AVA traffic has a far heavier tail, and suffers as a result.

Reference-contexts: A fundamental requirement is that they capture the dynamic aspects of ATM traffic: computer communication is bursty, and calls may last seconds or days. Data and compressed video traffic have been shown to exhibit signs of long range dependence <ref> [Leland93, Garrett94] </ref>, and both client-server (distributed) and distributive communication can give rise to highly correlated traffic. Section 1.3.2 argued that in an open multi-service network it will be impossible to characterise all services because they, too, are network users. The traffic 9 parameters are thus of key importance. <p> Characteristics Two VBR video sources were used as the two classes of traffic, namely an AVA video trace, and a trace of the "Starwars" movie. 8.5.2.1 The Starwars Data The Starwars data set was produced by Garrett and Vetterli at Bellcore, and has been studied in some detail, for example <ref> [Garrett94, Chong94, Crosby95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The"stop-and-go" queueing mechanism is a rate-based control which guarantees no congestion whilst preserving smoothness properties of the input traffic <ref> [Golestani90] </ref>. Each node divides time into frames of fixed size; traffic which arrives during frame i is transmitted during frame i + 1. Sources are policed at entry, and the mechanism guarantees a rate and the minimum and maximum end-to-end delay.

Reference-contexts: Random discard performs better than tail dropping, but is more difficult to implement [Yuan89]. It is also unsuitable for traffic with a higher layer frame structure, such as packet data. Finally, buffer allocation can be combined with service priority to accommodate both delay and loss sensitive traffic <ref> [Gravey90, Roberts92] </ref>. To investigate the performance of the different buffer allocation policies, three were implemented on the Fairisle testbed.

Reference-contexts: This chapter investigates the CDV sustained by ATM traffic to determine the degree of tolerance required by the network and end-systems in the absence of traffic shaping functions. 6.1.1 Related Work To date, most research into CDV in ATM networks has been based on analytical models, for example <ref> [Roberts92, Molnar94, Gravey94] </ref>. These studies tend to approach the CDV problem by studying traffic at a single switch in isolation, and deriving bounds on the maximum queue length seen by an arriving customer. <p> It can be shown, however that as the length of the observation period tends to infinity, the proportion of cells discarded is the same irrespective of the starting point <ref> [Gravey94] </ref>. Recently an exponentially weighted CDV measure has been proposed, which produces the same CDV distribution (with mean 0) irrespective of the starting point of observation [Roosma94]. A drawback of this algorithm is the complexity of performing the exponential weighting on-the-fly. <p> A drawback of this algorithm is the complexity of performing the exponential weighting on-the-fly. An alternative definition, the so-called 2-point CDV, is defined to be the difference between the absolute cell transfer delay between two measurement points and the delay of a reference cell which experiences no contention <ref> [Gravey94] </ref>. The 2-point CDV is difficult to measure without a (synchronous) global clock, and was thus not measured.

Support for multimedia applications has been addressed by extending the network signalling interface <ref> [Bubenick91, Minzer91, Heijenk94] </ref>, providing sophisticated call and connection management signalling services. These approaches go some way towards addressing the problems of network control, but result in extremely complicated interfaces which are very difficult to specify and verify. <p> A study by the author [Crosby93], found that the gain in link utilisation resulting from renegotiation is insufficient to warrant its implementation. 57 4.3.3.3 A Simple Approach Other authors have addressed the grouping of related connections into calls and the composition of basic call components into sophisticated objects <ref> [Minzer91, Heijenk94] </ref>. The MSN-CMA recognises the need for sophisticated services, but adopts a simplified approach, providing only a point-to-point connection service, whose basic element is a liaison, uniquely defined by a pair of SAPs and a QoS specification.

Reference-contexts: obvious drawbacks, namely the duplication of physical networks, and their inability to accommodate different modes of communication led to the search for a technology which could integrate multiple services. 1.3.1 The Asynchronous Transfer Mode The Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing (ATDM) technique, whose early developers included AT&T Bell Laboratories [Fraser93], Cambridge <ref> [Hopper78] </ref> and CNET [Devault88], has become accepted as the best solution to the problem of integrating communications services. ATDM, now simply called ATM, borrows the best properties from each of two existing multiplexing mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Application domains receive explicit notification of all system activity which affects their QoS, and may dynamically negotiate for resources. This enables them to behave intelligently in response to the received resource allocation. Three prototype implementations of the architecture have been implemented.

Reference-contexts: The wire representation used by MSRPC2 for encoding data types, MSDR, is based on the procedural mechanism of XDR [Sun87], except that the byte ordering used by a client is specified by the server. The MSRPC2 Runtime The MSRPC2 runtime is implemented over the POSIX Pthreads interface <ref> [IEEE92] </ref>, and is portable apart from a layer which is used to hide the platform specific IPC primitives. MSRPC2 libraries exist for both Wanda and DEC Ultrix. <p> Since the control socket delivers requests asynchronously and since the master needs to be able to process several requests (from all layers) simultaneously, it is implemented as a multi-threaded process. The implementation uses the POSIX Pthreads package <ref> [IEEE92] </ref> to implement several threads of control to manage communication, timers, and management functions. Independent threads are scheduled by the Pthreads package, which also implements concurrency control primitives for shared data.

Reference-contexts: A number of formal description techniques (FDTs) have been developed which allow the specification (and testing) of protocols. The ITU-T has standardized the Specification and Description Language (SDL) <ref> [ITU-T88] </ref> for specification of signalling protocols. This has an associated graphical notation which may be used to illustrate protocol operation. Although it has been used to specify several large protocols, SDL permits the specification of infinite systems, which renders the verification of the specification formally undecidable in some cases.

Reference-contexts: The TINA architecture is based on well understood principles of distributed computing, and has built on the CORBA [OMG91], ANSA [ANSA89] and ODP <ref> [ITU-T92a] </ref> principles, whilst preserving compatibility with ITU-T standards. The architecture is broken down into four components: the computing, service, management and network architectures. The computing architecture uses the OSF Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) [OSF92] to define an object-based model for computation, communications services and management.

Reference-contexts: In summary, the approach fails to capitalise on advances in high level service architectures. The network management protocols standardized by the ITU-T are based on a layered network architecture, known as the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) <ref> [ITU-T92b, ITU-T92c] </ref>, which overlays a management network on top of the underlying transmission network topology.

Reference-contexts: This leads to severe difficulties when attempting to extend or evolve the protocols to new applications or technologies, such as ATM. The favoured approach of the ITU-T for the development of broadband services is to add a B-ISDN User Part (B-ISUP) to SS7 <ref> [ITU-T93a] </ref>, and to modify the ISDN user-network protocol, Q.931, to support B-ISDN access. This approach has already run into difficulties: Q.931 is unable to support virtual circuits, resource reservation, multicast or multi-connection calls, and consequently a new protocol, Q.2931 [ITU-T94a], is being developed.

Reference-contexts: It is widely recognised, however, that it is difficult or impossible to accurately police moments of the source distribution other than the peak, based on a short observation period [Tutufor90]. The ITU-T has selected a simplified leaky bucket algorithm <ref> [ITU-T93b] </ref> for policing the peak rate of a connection. Under this algorithm arriving cells are placed in a (virtual) buffer of size one, which is drained at the peak rate. <p> The CDV experienced by a connection determines the size of the buffer required at the receiver to ensure smooth playout of the signal; if this is too large the perceived quality will deteriorate. 94 The CDV is also intimately related to the leaky bucket algorithm, adopted by the ITU-T <ref> [ITU-T93b] </ref> and the ATM Forum as a technique for policing the peak rate of traffic entering the network. The algorithm relies on observation of the cell stream at a single point, and is consequently known as the 1-point CDV measure.

Reference-contexts: This approach has already run into difficulties: Q.931 is unable to support virtual circuits, resource reservation, multicast or multi-connection calls, and consequently a new protocol, Q.2931 <ref> [ITU-T94a] </ref>, is being developed. More seriously, this indicates that the telecommunications industry has yet to realise that service integration in broadband (specifically, ATM) networks, occurs at the ATM layer, and not at a higher "service layer". <p> It is now widely accepted that the signalling procedures should be located in an Out of Band (OB) control plane, for reasons of performance and efficiency. Current OB signalling protocols, including draft signalling standards for ATM such as those defined and standardized by the ITU-T <ref> [ITU-T94a] </ref> and ATM Forum [ATMF94], are complex and inflexible. This results from their origins in existing message-based ISDN signalling protocols which assume that all services are embedded within the network, under control of a single provider. <p> The ITU-T ATM UNI protocol was initially based on Recommendation Q.931, also known as the Digital Subscriber Signalling System 1 (DSS 1) used for ISDN signalling [ITU-T94b]. The call procedures in this protocol are inadequate for ATM networks, however, with the result that Recommendation Q.2931 <ref> [ITU-T94a] </ref>, and extensions, also known as DSS 2, are being developed. The ATM Forum UNI [ATMF94] is a similar protocol aligned as far as possible with DSS 2, but with some simplified procedures, and a broader set of connection services.

Reference-contexts: At the next node, the packet is held for that amount of time before entering the scheduler. Thus the mechanism can bound the variance in end-to-end delay. The Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) mechanism has a similar time-framed structure <ref> [Kalmanek90] </ref>. To enable the provision of multiple transmission rates to different traffic types, HRR has a hierarchy of frames: a frame at level i is allocated a proportion of the bandwidth at level i1. The server processes frame 0 repeatedly.

Reference-contexts: Given a particular traffic mix, the CAC function must determine whether accepting a new connection will cause the QoS constraints of any of the connections to be violated, either on the basis of pre-computed <ref> [Kelly91] </ref> or measured data [Courcoubetis91, Crosby95], or both [Gibbens95]. * Flow and congestion controls, (burst and cell scales). <p> Many candidate CAC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, for example <ref> [Ahmadi90, Kelly91, Gibbens95] </ref>. Details of the CAC algorithm are beyond the scope of this dissertation; some initial work on CAC using Fairisle is reported in [Crosby95]. In addition to making the CAC decision, resource allocation decisions must be made at lower layers.

Studying the renewal process of the above model after the reference stream has passed through an infinite series of heavily loaded queues, they derived an expression for the tail behaviour of a GI=G=1 queue (representing a playout buffer at the sink) serving arriving reference cells.

Reference-contexts: A nave approach would be to partition the buffer between the connections.

Partial Buffer Sharing (PBS) [Hebuterne89, Petr90, Bonomi90] discriminates by class, assigning a maximum queue length to the delay sensitive traffic an arriving cell which finds its share of the buffer space full is discarded. There is no threshold associated with the loss sensitive traffic.

Reference-contexts: Under Ultrix, access to a raw MSNL protocol layer is provided via the BSD 4.3 socket interface <ref> [Le*er89] </ref>, which permits applications to set up connections and to send and receive data. The implementation available at the start of this research incorporated all MSNA functionality within the kernel. <p> Previous implementations of MSNA [Dixon92, McAuley90] have combined the functions user and control planes into a single functional unit, normally bound within the operating system kernel of a host or network gateway in a system specific manner (following the example of Unix <ref> [Le*er89] </ref> and Mach [Accetta86]). This makes the management of multiprocessor systems such as the Fairisle switch difficult, because it assumes that each processor (kernel) is responsible for its own management. <p> In a conventional communication architecture, these functions are presented to the user (application) via a control interface which is platform specific; they may, for example, be represented by the BSD socket interface <ref> [Le*er89] </ref> or the Wanda IPC interface. Beneath this interface the platform implements the control plane functions to build the appropriate connection components for the user. Most existing application programming interfaces (APIs) are insufficiently descriptive to allow proper control of the communication needs of multi-service applications.

Reference-contexts: A fundamental requirement is that they capture the dynamic aspects of ATM traffic: computer communication is bursty, and calls may last seconds or days. Data and compressed video traffic have been shown to exhibit signs of long range dependence <ref> [Leland93, Garrett94] </ref>, and both client-server (distributed) and distributive communication can give rise to highly correlated traffic. Section 1.3.2 argued that in an open multi-service network it will be impossible to characterise all services because they, too, are network users. The traffic 9 parameters are thus of key importance. <p> The data sources used in these experiments were constructed from the Bellcore Ethernet traces <ref> [Leland93] </ref>, which contain the measured activity on a busy Ethernet over tens of hours. Two traces were constructed from the measurements of wide area traffic by multiplexing 50 and 60 independent segments of the Bellcore traces.

Layering, multiplexing and error control are min-imised; MSNA provides guarantees only on the integrity of data actually delivered end-to-end. In MSNA an ATM connection (called a liaison) is uniquely identified by the two ATM end-point addresses, called Service Access Points (SAPs), which it connects.

Reference-contexts: Only three studies of which the author is aware have attempted to model analytically the CDV arising in a tandem arrangement of queueing systems typical of a multi-hop ATM network <ref> [van den Berg92, Kelly94, Matragi94] </ref>. The first two are used in this chapter, which compares their predictions with measured results. They are described in Section 6.3 below. <p> Fixing the maximum tolerable loss rate fl permits the leak rate of the bucket to be determined. Alternatively, fixing the leak rate at 1:05T , as used in this study, w represents an upper bound on the CDV with loss rate fl. Finally, note that <ref> [Matragi94] </ref> offers a model of CDV which is more general than the above, using a model of bursty background traffic in which the burst size distribution is determined by a Markov chain. <p> The two bounds and the measured results confirm this. For almost the same load, source E with Bernoulli and AVA traffic shows that the key parameter influencing the CDV is the variance of the background traffic, as suggested in <ref> [Matragi94] </ref>. In all cases except for the high loads of data and video traffic the measured values of the tail of the CDV distribution develop in a way which is dependent on the background traffic type and the total link load. <p> Alternatively, given that the CDV bound can be determined for a given traffic mix, the operator might choose to set the tolerance parameter t according to the predictions of the analytical models. This would simplify the intra-network control mechanisms. Finally, validation of the multi-stage model of <ref> [Matragi94] </ref> should be considered for future work, since this would permit more direct comparison with the measured results presented in this chapter. 124 Chapter 7 The Burst Expansion Phenomenon 7.1 Introduction This chapter studies a process known as burst expansion the mechanism whereby bursts of cells entering an ATM network tend

Reference-contexts: Multimedia streams are routed directly to the devices which consume them, freeing the CPU and improving performance. 2.2 The Multi-Service Network Architecture The ATM protocol stack implemented at the Computer Laboratory is called the Multi-Service Network Architecture (MSNA) <ref> [McAuley90] </ref>. Key to the efficiency of MSNA is its use of lightweight Virtual Circuits (VCs) which can be quickly set up and torn down, and which optimise for the common case, namely error-free communication [Leslie83]. <p> to the end of Chapter 4, in which details of the call control procedures supported by the MSN-CMA are described. 3.2 Existing Control Plane Functions in MSNA Before describing the design of the MSN-CMA, it is necessary to review the control functions provided by MSNA, both as described by McAuley <ref> [McAuley90] </ref>, and as implemented at the Computer Laboratory. MSNA was described in some detail in Section 2.2. <p> In order to successfully incorporate such devices into a multi-service network, proxy signalling is required whereby some other node signals on behalf of the device; the control path must be able to differ from the data path. Previous implementations of MSNA <ref> [Dixon92, McAuley90] </ref> have combined the functions user and control planes into a single functional unit, normally bound within the operating system kernel of a host or network gateway in a system specific manner (following the example of Unix [Le*er89] and Mach [Accetta86]).

Reference-contexts: There is no obvious way to integrate such systems into traditional network control architectures based on the ISDN approach. Support for multimedia applications has been addressed by extending the network signalling interface <ref> [Bubenick91, Minzer91, Heijenk94] </ref>, providing sophisticated call and connection management signalling services. These approaches go some way towards addressing the problems of network control, but result in extremely complicated interfaces which are very difficult to specify and verify. <p> A study by the author [Crosby93], found that the gain in link utilisation resulting from renegotiation is insufficient to warrant its implementation. 57 4.3.3.3 A Simple Approach Other authors have addressed the grouping of related connections into calls and the composition of basic call components into sophisticated objects <ref> [Minzer91, Heijenk94] </ref>. The MSN-CMA recognises the need for sophisticated services, but adopts a simplified approach, providing only a point-to-point connection service, whose basic element is a liaison, uniquely defined by a pair of SAPs and a QoS specification. <p> No attempt, of which the author is aware, has been made to verify the correctness of the CMAP protocol, and no reports of its implementation have been made. 4.5.5 EXPRESS The EXPRESS architecture <ref> [Minzer91] </ref> is similar to CMAP in its service interface, but offers an object-based approach to call construction: call components can be treated as building blocks of more sophisticated connection services and thus the architecture is more open than CMAP.

Reference-contexts: This chapter investigates the CDV sustained by ATM traffic to determine the degree of tolerance required by the network and end-systems in the absence of traffic shaping functions. 6.1.1 Related Work To date, most research into CDV in ATM networks has been based on analytical models, for example <ref> [Roberts92, Molnar94, Gravey94] </ref>. These studies tend to approach the CDV problem by studying traffic at a single switch in isolation, and deriving bounds on the maximum queue length seen by an arriving customer.

Reference-contexts: Although optimal with regard to minimizing the maximum delay and maximising the minimum delay, all deadline-based algorithms require the customers to be sorted according to the deadline schedule. Computation of the schedule has high cost without appropriate hardware support. A candidate hardware queue sorting mechanism proposed by Moore <ref> [Moore94] </ref> could be implemented in ATM port controllers for this purpose. This device has a cost proportional to twice the number of elements to be sorted. 8.3.1.2 Rate Guarantees Several other mechanisms have been proposed which guarantee each connection a minimum rate of service whilst isolating its traffic.

Reference-contexts: Recently the RACE EXPLOIT project has reported the practical validation of several analytical models of CDV <ref> [Brinkmann94, Louis94, Nellas94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: New services incorporating multiple media must be integrated into the distributed systems environment. This problem has been addressed by several authors. Nicolaou <ref> [Nicolaou91] </ref>, for example, defined an architecture named IMAC for real-time multimedia communication, integrating control and synchronisation support for typed continuous media streams and their performance constraints into the ANSA framework. Sreenan [Sreenan92] developed a synchronization service for continuous media applications, also using ANSA. <p> The services are responsible for ATM address management, signalling, routeing, CAC, and traditionally low-level device control functions, including parametari-sation of In Band (IB) control mechanisms which ensure that each connection meets its performance constraints. This approach is ideally suited to the support of multimedia communication architectures such as IMAC <ref> [Nicolaou91] </ref> which implement specialized control mechanisms for multimedia devices and streams. Each node surrenders control of communication to a separate master service. A single master may be responsible for many nodes of different types; where necessary it implements a protocol conversion which enables it to communicate with different equipment types. <p> Thus, support for architectures such as IMAC <ref> [Nicolaou91] </ref> is implicit in the MSN-CMA. Third party services, such as a synchronisation service or other "provider" acting on behalf of a client, may need to be able to set up communications paths and perform manipulation both of data and control interfaces before presenting the data to the client. <p> User plane services include both distributed computing and transport protocols. This is similar to the MSN-CMA in which MSRPC2 offers the distributed computing environment, and MSNA 71 offers stream based communication, but their model of multimedia communica-tion needs is more complex. An architecture such as IMAC <ref> [Nicolaou91] </ref>, integrated with the MSN-CMA would provide a service interface similar to that of MBA.

Similar to the MSN-CMA, the MBA is open in the sense that it provides building blocks for higher level services.

A further extension, called delay-EDD, permits the server to provide a hard delay and mean rate bound provided the source obeys a peak and mean rate [Ferrari89]. The deadline in this case is the theoretical deadline of each packet assuming that the source obeys the contract.

Reference-contexts: A nave approach would be to partition the buffer between the connections. This is similar to peak rate allocation of bandwidth, and requires large buffer 161 sizes [Kroner91]. Partial Buffer Sharing (PBS) <ref> [Hebuterne89, Petr90, Bonomi90] </ref> discriminates by class, assigning a maximum queue length to the delay sensitive traffic an arriving cell which finds its share of the buffer space full is discarded. There is no threshold associated with the loss sensitive traffic. <p> There is no threshold associated with the loss sensitive traffic. Threshold based discard performs significantly better than nave discard from the tail, but choice of the thresholds is critical <ref> [Petr90] </ref>.

These studies tend to approach the CDV problem by studying traffic at a single switch in isolation, and deriving bounds on the maximum queue length seen by an arriving customer. <p> analytical models, namely the approximation of van den Berg and Resing [van den Berg92], described in Chapter 6, and an analytical approximation from the COST 224 project, which is introduced in Section 7.2 below. 7.2 The Burst Expansion Rate The COST 224 project developed an analytical approximation for burst expansion <ref> [Roberts92] </ref>, pp 193, which aims to approximate the rate at which a burst of 125 traffic will expand as it proceeds through a network of output buffered switches. <p> The pessimistic estimation for the expected increase of the burst size is given by E (B) 2 (1 )(1 ( + )) For example, with D = 20; = 0:9 and + 1=D = 0:95 the expected burst expansion is E (B) 5. In <ref> [Roberts92] </ref> this approximation was compared to simulated results for a network with 100 switching stages, using the above parameters. In the simulation the position of each cell in a burst was traced over successive switching stages. <p> Random discard performs better than tail dropping, but is more difficult to implement [Yuan89]. It is also unsuitable for traffic with a higher layer frame structure, such as packet data. Finally, buffer allocation can be combined with service priority to accommodate both delay and loss sensitive traffic <ref> [Gravey90, Roberts92] </ref>. To investigate the performance of the different buffer allocation policies, three were implemented on the Fairisle testbed. <p> For mix B the pushout mechanism can protect the bursty AVA traffic because it represents only 28% of the load. For mix A, however, even the pushout mechanism fails to protect the AVA traffic. This observation concurs with <ref> [Roberts92] </ref> which suggests that pushout traffic should be less than 0.2 of the total load. * Irrespective of the service discipline and buffer allocation policy the total CLR remains roughly the same under all mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: The encoding of these protocol elements is service-specific, and even though an abstract syntax and encoding scheme such as ASN.1 <ref> [Rose91] </ref> may be used, the syntax of the elements used by an application must be identified on a per-interaction basis. The problem here is that signalling for all services is multiplexed onto a single access protocol which must be continually enhanced as applications develop. <p> In Capability Set 3, additional support will be provided for broadcast connections and other services which have yet to be identified. The encoding rules for signalling messages are specified individually for each ITU-T protocol, rather than using a set of standardised procedural rules, such as ASN.1 <ref> [Rose91] </ref> or MSDR. The encoding is often inefficient, requiring bit-wise operations on arbitrary sub-parts of data words. <p> The network management protocols standardized by the ITU-T are based on a layered network architecture, known as the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) [ITU-T92b, ITU-T92c], which overlays a management network on top of the underlying transmission network topology. Management protocols are based on the use of CMIP/CMIS <ref> [Rose91] </ref> (the OSI management protocols), which are crude in the sense that they permit only basic query and response type interaction with managed objects.

Reference-contexts: In classic Earliest Due Date scheduling (EDD) [Jackson60] customers are scheduled by their deadlines to the start of service, where the deadline is a function of the customer arrival time. EDD can be shown to minimise the proportion of customers which miss their deadlines <ref> [Saito90] </ref>. A modification of EDD, the Shortest Time to Extinction (STE) policy, discards customers which have already exceeded their due dates, reducing the delay for the remaining customers [Panwar88].

Reference-contexts: Periodically the TDS queries each entity to determine the status of its links, and to detect whether or not the entity itself has failed. If any element of the MD has failed then the TDS triggers a topology update. The topology discovery algorithm used in the Autonet <ref> [Schroeder90] </ref> could be adapted for use in this way. The TDS can also make use of the ANS for notification of link errors.

Reference-contexts: Aawater and Schoute [Aawater91] have shown that the optimal set of priority based policies which balance low loss with low delay are the set of QLT policies with different values of the threshold parameter. Two other algorithms of interest are FIFO+ [Clark92] and Hop Laxity Threshold (HLT) <ref> [Schulzrinne94] </ref>. Under FIFO+, each network node estimates the average delay for each class of traffic. Each packet is given a priority, on departing, which indicates its experienced delay relative to the average.

Further details can be found in <ref> [SRG94] </ref>. 2.1.1 The Fairisle Switch Fabric The Fairisle switch fabric is based on a simple, 4 fi 4, input buffered, self-routeing crossbar element. Switches of degree greater than 4 are constructed using multiple 4 fi 4 crossbars in a 2-stage delta interconnection network. <p> Although MSNA defines the control point for IB functions, namely MS-Access, in practice it has ever been implemented, and the mechanisms for setting up and parameterising IB control points were never defined. 3 Based on the ATM camera described by Pratt in <ref> [SRG94] </ref>. 32 3.3 Structure of the MSN-CMA The motivation of the introduction, combined with lessons learned from the failings of the simple metasignalling protocol, lead to a statement of the main architectural requirements of the MSN-CMA, which include: * A rich set of features for use by multimedia applications which demand <p> For a simple FCFS queueing policy the CLS can sustain a cell forwarding rate of approximately 60 Mb/s or 0.6 of the line rate whilst performing simple measurements.

Reference-contexts: An important factor determining the size of the playout buffer required at the receiver is the degree of correlation in the perturbed reference stream. Appendix C presents results using the Index of Dispersion for Counts (IDC) <ref> [Sriram86] </ref>, which show that the reference stream assumes the properties of the background traffic, and is thus correlated in the same way.

Reference-contexts: In traditional telephony and the narrowband Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), a circuit represents a static allocation of bandwidth and identifies the route followed by data through the network. In ATM, as in other connection oriented packet networks such as X.25 <ref> [Stallings89] </ref>, circuits are virtual: the network allocates the user a Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) which is used to label every cell. The network establishes a mapping between the VCI and state which is used to route cells through the network and allocate them transmission capacity. <p> Both user terminals and network nodes may now be sophisticated computers, capable of communicating reliably at high data rates. Software technology has also advanced significantly. Since SS7 was first released the familiar OSI 7 layer model of communications <ref> [Stallings89] </ref> has been developed, encouraging the specification of layered services and protocols. Structured programming, high level languages and distributed systems techniques have also become widely used. <p> Both to enable this, and for enhanced reliability, the UMI uses a (modified) three-phase signalling mechanism for connection setup. Other interactions, including SAP management, are two-phase.

Reference-contexts: The ATM Forum UNI [ATMF94] is a similar protocol aligned as far as possible with DSS 2, but with some simplified procedures, and a broader set of connection services. Details of the differences between the two can be found in <ref> [Stiller95] </ref>. Both are based on message exchange on top of a reliable signalling adaptation layer, Q.SAAL. Messages contain commands, and compulsory and optional, variable length information elements. An example of a compulsory information element in a CONNECT message is the call reference.

Reference-contexts: The wire representation used by MSRPC2 for encoding data types, MSDR, is based on the procedural mechanism of XDR <ref> [Sun87] </ref>, except that the byte ordering used by a client is specified by the server. The MSRPC2 Runtime The MSRPC2 runtime is implemented over the POSIX Pthreads interface [IEEE92], and is portable apart from a layer which is used to hide the platform specific IPC primitives. <p> It implements message-based connection control between users and switches, and between switches, and does not define any architectural aspects of network control. Like the MSDR representation used in the MSN-CMA UMI, SPANS message encoding is procedural, using the XDR <ref> [Sun87] </ref> representation. SPANS is also lightweight, using an unreliable transport with timeouts and retransmission as in the UMI. Unlike the UMI protocol, it is not RPC based. The protocol incorporates 26 signalling message types which enable the management of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections, including multicast membership.

Reference-contexts: This is performed by the master, allowing an AF INET address to be specified as the destination for an ATM connection. This provides more flexibility than the static mapping as used in a previous mechanism for IP address resolution over X.25 <ref> [Malis92, Sun90] </ref>. Although the UMI protocol permits the specification of user QoS requirements, such as the IP MTU, the current implementation uses 4 different MTU sizes to enable experimentation.

Reference-contexts: The problem here is that signalling for all services is multiplexed onto a single access protocol which must be continually enhanced as applications develop. Ten-nenhouse <ref> [Tennenhouse89] </ref> identified the need to avoid multiplexing in the data path because it is inefficient and leads to poor performance.

Reference-contexts: It is widely recognised, however, that it is difficult or impossible to accurately police moments of the source distribution other than the peak, based on a short observation period <ref> [Tutufor90] </ref>. The ITU-T has selected a simplified leaky bucket algorithm [ITU-T93b] for policing the peak rate of a connection. Under this algorithm arriving cells are placed in a (virtual) buffer of size one, which is drained at the peak rate.

Reference-contexts: Only three studies of which the author is aware have attempted to model analytically the CDV arising in a tandem arrangement of queueing systems typical of a multi-hop ATM network <ref> [van den Berg92, Kelly94, Matragi94] </ref>. The first two are used in this chapter, which compares their predictions with measured results. They are described in Section 6.3 below. <p> This can be used in a comparison with an analytical approximation for a series of output buffered switches due to van den Berg and Resing <ref> [van den Berg92] </ref>, which is reproduced below. The analysis shows that a CBR connection traversing successive switches where it is multiplexed with Poisson traffic at high load, asymptotically approaches a maximum perturbation. <p> The model may be solved using a probability generating function for the X n : let h n (z) = E (z X n ): In <ref> [van den Berg92] </ref> it is shown that h n (z) = zh n1 (g (z)); where g (z) = e (z1) is the probability generating function of a Poisson random variable with mean . From this recurrence relation expressions for the mean and variance of X n can be derived. <p> This chapter investigates burst expansion using the experimental platform based around the Fairisle network, described in previous chapters. The results of the study are compared to two analytical models, namely the approximation of van den Berg and Resing <ref> [van den Berg92] </ref>, described in Chapter 6, and an analytical approximation from the COST 224 project, which is introduced in Section 7.2 below. 7.2 The Burst Expansion Rate The COST 224 project developed an analytical approximation for burst expansion [Roberts92], pp 193, which aims to approximate the rate at which a <p> Fortunately such a model is to hand: the analysis of van den Berg and Resing <ref> [van den Berg92] </ref>, described in Section 6.6, suggests that irrespective of the input traffic characteristics of a given reference source, after large number of multiplexing stages at which the reference source is multiplexed with Poisson background traffic, its traffic will have the properties of a renewal process, with an inter-cell arrival

Reference-contexts: Choice of the frame size is difficult, because it must accommodate multiple rates. The jitter-EDD policy 145 is similar to OCF, but maintains an additional variable per packet which repre-sents the difference between its deadline and its actual service time <ref> [Verma91] </ref>. At the next node, the packet is held for that amount of time before entering the scheduler. Thus the mechanism can bound the variance in end-to-end delay. The Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) mechanism has a similar time-framed structure [Kalmanek90].

Reference-contexts: Discarding from the head may be preferable to discarding from the tail: from the network's point of view, traffic which has already consumed resources is more valuable, however delay-sensitive cells at the front of a queue have already been delayed, and have a higher chance of discard at the receiver <ref> [Yin90] </ref>. Discarding from the tail, however, has a lower cell buffer requirement for the same total cell loss [Lucantoni90]. Random discard performs better than tail dropping, but is more difficult to implement [Yuan89]. It is also unsuitable for traffic with a higher layer frame structure, such as packet data.

Finally, buffer allocation can be combined with service priority to accommodate both delay and loss sensitive traffic [Gravey90, Roberts92].

Reference-contexts: Fair Queueing can be shown to be equivalent to the Virtual Clock algorithm, in which arriving packets are stamped with the difference between their expected arrival times, given the negotiated source rates and the time at which they arrived <ref> [Zhang90] </ref>. This is used to schedule the cells for transmission. The two algorithms differ from EDD because they provide only a rate guarantee and not a delay bound. 8.3.1.3 Priority Mechanisms In [Lim88] Lim and Kobza described the HOL-PJ scheduler, which stands for Head-Of-Line with Priority Jumps.

An excellent comparison of work conserving and non-work conserving policies is given in <ref> [Zhang91] </ref>. Finally, a mechanism named Rate Controlled Static Priority scheduling (RCSP) which separates the regulation of traffic and the ordering for transmission has been proposed by Zhang and Ferrari [Zhang93a]. <p> Slight rate mismatches between the source and the RB scheduler will result in some 149 variation, with the result that the inter-cell time for reference connection cells should be bounded by 2T <ref> [Zhang91] </ref>, as shown in Figure 8.3. The diagram shows the arrival and transmission times for each of 3 cells at the RB scheduler. Cell 1 arrives just before a RB scheduling epoch and is transmitted on the epoch.

Finally, a mechanism named Rate Controlled Static Priority scheduling (RCSP) which separates the regulation of traffic and the ordering for transmission has been proposed by Zhang and Ferrari <ref> [Zhang93a] </ref>. RCSP has the advantage that it avoids the frame-based granularity of bandwidth allocation of HRR and stop-and-go, whilst still enabling the implementation of work conserving and nonwork conserving policies.
