Title: THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF N-GRAMS IN GENERATION  
Author: Irene Langkilde and Kevin Knight

Affiliation: Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California  
Abstract: We examine the practical synergy between symbolic and statistical language processing in a generator called Nitrogen. The analysis provides insight into the kinds of linguistic decisions that bigram frequency statistics can make, and how it improves scalability. We also discuss the limits of bigram statistical knowledge. We focus on specific examples of Nitrogen's output.

Reference-contexts: Syntactic tags will alleviate the blurring problem that occurs when a lexical item has more than one part of speech, (e.g., in example 1 where the frequency count for "trusts" includes both its use as a noun and as a verb). We plan to use the Penn Treebank corpus <ref> (Marcus et al., 1994) </ref> in collecting this data. Thus for now the symbolic half of Nitrogen's generation mainly provides word order information and mappings from semantic relationships to general syntactic ones (like noun or verb phrases). Detailed syntactic information and agreement rules are omitted.

Reference-contexts: Concept names are enclosed in vertical bars; we use an automated form of Wordnet 1.5 <ref> (Miller, 1990) </ref>. The slash after a label is shorthand for the :INSTANCE relation. Symbolic knowledge in Nitrogen is used to convert an input to a word lattice, from which the statistical extractor selects the best output.
