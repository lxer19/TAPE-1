Reference-contexts: Explanation: The ability of bbns to provide an explanation for their conclusions is still controversial, and it represents a challenge for researchers in the area. Consistency: bbns improve over the traditional scheme of Bayesian expert systems <ref> ( Charniak, 1991 ) </ref> , since they ensure that if a network is locally consistent, it is also globally consistent. Problems arise when an inconsistent probability value is assigned, because they do not provide any efficient contradiction handling method.

Reference-contexts: During the past decade, three main classes of tmss have emerged: Justification-based tmss (jtmss) 498 <ref> ( Doyle, 1979 ) </ref> , Assumption-based tmss (atmss) ( de Kleer, 1986a ) , and Logic-based tmss (ltmss) ( McAllester, 1980 ) . A jtms records derivability dependencies among propositions and propagates binary truth-values along chains of dependencies.

Reference-contexts: Several attempts have been made to include probabilities in tmss. tmss that are able to reason on the basis of probabilistic rather than binary truth-values are called Belief Maintenance Systems (bmss).

Reference-contexts: Researchers in Artificial Intelligence have developed a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (tmss) ( McAllester, 1990 ) , which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge, to provide well-founded explanation for their conclusions, and to detect and handle contradictions <ref> ( Forbus and de Kleer, 1992 ) </ref> . During the past decade, three main classes of tmss have emerged: Justification-based tmss (jtmss) 498 ( Doyle, 1979 ) , Assumption-based tmss (atmss) ( de Kleer, 1986a ) , and Logic-based tmss (ltmss) ( McAllester, 1980 ) . <p> These features enable the ibns to represent both the complete ignorance of a conditional probability and the partial information about a conditional or a prior probability. Explanation tmss provide rational explanation for their conclusions by describing how these conclusions follow from the current set of assumptions <ref> ( Forbus and de Kleer, 1992 ) </ref> : they not only trace back the set of assumptions responsible for the conclusion but they also describe the derivation steps that lead from those assumptions to the conclusion to be explained. In the lbms, each proposition is labeled with an interval truth-value.

Reference-contexts: This property, which is implicit in the form of the inequalities in our constraints, implies a monotonic narrowing of the truth-values, thus ensuring the incrementality of the lbms. 2.5 Properties Extending the usual logical concepts of soundness and completeness from Boolean values to probability intervals <ref> ( Grosof, 1986 ) </ref> , we can say that the system defined by the constraints 1 and 2 is probabilistically sound (i.e. it returns intervals that are equal to or wider than the intended ones), but it is not complete (i.e. it does not return intervals that are equal to or

Reference-contexts: Falkenhainer ( Falkenhainer, 1986 ) developed a Justification-based bms, introducing Dempster-Shafer ( Shafer, 1976 ) belief functions in a jtms. De Kleer and Williams ( de Kleer and Williams, 1987 ) augmented the atms formalism with probability measures. Laskey and Lehner <ref> ( Laskey and Lehner, 1989 ) </ref> proved a formal equivalence between the belief of a proposition computed by a Dempster-Shafer function and the probability of the atms-label of the proposition, and they provide a correct algorithm for computing the beliefs of these labels.

Reference-contexts: During the past decade, three main classes of tmss have emerged: Justification-based tmss (jtmss) 498 ( Doyle, 1979 ) , Assumption-based tmss (atmss) ( de Kleer, 1986a ) , and Logic-based tmss (ltmss) <ref> ( McAllester, 1980 ) </ref> . A jtms records derivability dependencies among propositions and propagates binary truth-values along chains of dependencies. The atms also records derivability dependencies among propositions, but rather than propagating truth-values it labels each proposition with the minimal consistent set of assumptions under which it can be derived.

Reference-contexts: It would be better if they were able to identify the set of inconsistent assignments and ask for the retraction of one (or some) of them. Researchers in Artificial Intelligence have developed a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (tmss) <ref> ( McAllester, 1990 ) </ref> , which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge, to provide well-founded explanation for their conclusions, and to detect and handle contradictions ( Forbus and de Kleer, 1992 ) . <p> On the other hand, a ltms manipulates full propositional formulas built from propositions and truth-functional connectives, rather than networks of dependencies, and propagates truth-values using a unit resolution style algorithm called Boolean Constraint Propagation (bcp) <ref> ( McAllester, 1990 ) </ref> . Several attempts have been made to include probabilities in tmss. tmss that are able to reason on the basis of probabilistic rather than binary truth-values are called Belief Maintenance Systems (bmss).

Reference-contexts: i an interval truth-value: we will denote with P fl (f i ) = p fl and P fl (f i ) = p fl the lower and the upper bounds of the function P (f i ) = [p fl p fl ], respectively. 2.2 Probabilistic Logic Probabilistic logic <ref> ( Nilsson, 1986 ) </ref> provides a semantic framework for extending the standard (Boolean) concept of satisfaction to a probabilistic one, that can be interpreted in terms of the Venn Diagram representation of the probability of a proposition.

Reference-contexts: Since we have devised an efficient method to calculate the overlapping factor and to apply constraint 2, and since probabilistic entailment is known to be intractable in nature <ref> ( Nilsson, 1993 ) </ref> , the incompleteness of the lbms represents a compromise between functionality and efficiency.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns) are a powerful formalism for reasoning under uncertainty. They have been summarized by Pearl <ref> ( Pearl, 1988 ) </ref> , but they have been independently developed by several researchers during the past few years. bbns have been successfully applied to several domains, from medical diagnosis to natural language understanding. <p> The INFERNO system ( Quinlan, 1983 ) , that is usually regarded as a local approximation to probabilistic logic ( Pearl, 1988; Nilsson, 1993 ) , exhibits this kind of behavior, in producing wider bounds. Because of that, INFERNO has been strongly criticized <ref> ( Pearl, 1988 ) </ref> . 2.3 Constraints The weakness of the constraints derived from (2) arises from too strong an enforcement of their locality based on the assumption that all proposition in a clause are pairwise disjoint and, in the Venn Diagram representation of a clause, the intersection of all propositions

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the constraints directly derived from inequality (2) turn out to be too 499 weak: the bounds they produce are too wide, thus including inconsistent values. The INFERNO system <ref> ( Quinlan, 1983 ) </ref> , that is usually regarded as a local approximation to probabilistic logic ( Pearl, 1988; Nilsson, 1993 ) , exhibits this kind of behavior, in producing wider bounds.

Reference-contexts: Generalizing definition (2) to interval truth-values, we derived a set of constraints on the minimum and maximum probability of propositions <ref> ( Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ) </ref> , by dropping the assumption that all literals in a clause are pairwise disjoint. The first constraint enforces the left hand side of (2). <p> In this case, the clause is unit open, and the constraint increases appropriately the minimum probability of the remaining literal. The algorithm for applying the constraint is basically a Waltz's propagation algorithm extended to intervals, and it is described in <ref> ( Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ) </ref> : each proposition is labeled with a set of possible values, and the constraints (in our case, the application of the above defined constraints to the clauses) are used to restrict this set.
