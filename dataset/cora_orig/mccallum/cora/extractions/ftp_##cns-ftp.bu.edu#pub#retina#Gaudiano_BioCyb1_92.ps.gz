Abstract: A Unified Neural Network Model of Spatio-Temporal Processing in X and Y Retinal Ganglion Cells. I: Analytical Results Abstract This work presents unified analyses of spatial and temporal visual information processing in a feed-forward network of neurons that obey membrane, or shunting equations. The feed-forward shunting network possesses properties that make it well suited for processing of static, spatial information. However, it is shown here that those same properties of the shunting network that lead to good spatial processing imply poor temporal processing characteristics. This article presents an extension of the feed-forward shunting network model that solves this problem by means of preprocessing layers. The anatomical interpretation of the resulting model is structurally analogous to recently discovered data on a retinal circuit connecting cones to retinal ganglion cells through pairs of push-pull bipolar cells. Mathematical analysis of the lumped model leads to the hypothesis that X and Y retinal ganglion cells may consist of a single mechanism acting in different parameter ranges. This hypothesis is confirmed in the companion article, wherein the modelin conjunction with a nonlinear temporal adaptation mechanismis used to reproduce experimental data of both X and Y cells by simple changes in morphological and physiological parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The retina of all vertebrates is organized into three cellular (or nuclear) layers and two synaptic (or plexiform) layers <ref> (Dowling, 1987) </ref>. Information flows from the photoreceptors, through a layer of bipolar cells, and finally through the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose axons project via the optic nerve to subcortical and cortical areas.

Reference-contexts: These converging push-pull bipolar pathways coexist with and overlap the well-known diverging bipolar pathways that give rise to ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cell classes (Fig. 5b). Similar push-pull bipolar!RGC connections also appear to exist for the ON- and OFF-alpha RGC classes <ref> (Freed and Sterling, 1988) </ref>. The push-pull mechanism has been interpreted as a means of increasing the cone's effective dynamic range (McGuire et al., 1986; Sterling, 1990) by ensuring that excitation is accompanied by disinhibition, and vice versa.

Detailed derivation of all results presented here and in the companion article can be found elsewhere <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The new model is structurally analogous to the feed-forward circuit connecting photoreceptors to RGCs through opponent pairs of bipolar cells, and suggests that X and Y cells may consist of the same mechanism acting in different parameter ranges. This hypothesis is more fully developed in a companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref>, in which the model is used to simulate several fundamental properties of both X and Y RGCs. <p> Throughout this article it is assumed that C &lt; S and C &gt; S, which is representative of an on-center, off-surround anatomy, though all results generalize to off-center on-surround anatomies as well. Parameters can be found in the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref>. <p> Alternatively, a mechanism that acts feed-forward within each pathway can force the shunting cells to actively decay at input signal cessation. In addition to having the desired functional properties, I will show in this and the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref> that a model based on such a mechanism is able to fit anatomical, morphological, and physiological data on the circuit connecting cones, bipolar cells, and X and Y retinal ganglion cells. Fig. 5a schematically illustrates such a mechanism. <p> the model and the experimentally observed response of RGCs to step functions: although different classes of RGC respond in different fashions to input onset and offset, both X and Y cells respond to stimulus onset (offset) with sharp overshoots (undershoots) followed by a decay (rise) to an approximately constant level <ref> (for some examples, see Gaudiano, 1992) </ref>. Rather than ascribe this discrepancy to a shortcoming of the present model, I use it as a motivational tool to again argue that some processing of the input signal must take place prior to the input level of the shunting network. <p> A specific model of temporal adaptation that has these characteristics is presented and analyzed in the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref>. 10 Response to Modulated Gratings We now turn to another class of spatiotemporal modulation functions that is frequently encountered in this experimental literature: the temporally-modulated sinusoidal grating. <p> In Section 9, I suggested that the overshoots and undershoots seen in RGC responses are generated in preprocessing layers, such as the photoreceptor layer. I now claim that the same overshoots and undershoots are also responsible 9 for on-off responses in Y cells. In the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref>, I introduce a mechanism for nonlinear preprocessing of the input to the push-pull network that resolves the discrepancies outlined thus far, including the existence of on-off responses in Y cells but not in X cells. 12 Summary This article has introduced a model of spatiotemporal processing in retinal ganglion <p> However, it was suggested that all of these discrepancies could be resolved by inclusion of a nonlinear preprocessing mechanism whose properties resemble those of photoreceptors. In the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992) </ref> I will introduce a model of such a nonlinear mechanism, and show that the resulting network can indeed resolve these discrepancies and replicate many experimentally determined aspects of X and Y RGC behavior.

Reference-contexts: The model was derived from the feed-forward shunting network <ref> (Grossberg, 1970) </ref> as a solution to the network's inability to track temporal modulation of nonnegative input signals. The resulting push-pull shunting network possesses a number of important analytical and functional properties.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, (1) guarantees that activation is always bounded between the values B and D, regardless of input intensity. Through a simple change of variables, (1) can be interpreted as a passive membrane equation <ref> (e.g., Grossberg, 1988, p. 35) </ref>, in which case the inputs modulate membrane conductance of two ionic species which have opposite effects on membrane polarization. The behavior of network (1) has been analyzed through various mathematical techniques.

Reference-contexts: steady uniform background, i.e., let I (x) I (constant); the temporal modulation function is m (t) = sin t, (28) and the spatial modulation is J (x) = ff cos !x. (29) The above equations describe a form of counterphase modulation such as is typically encountered in the experimental literature <ref> (e.g., Hochstein and Shapley, 1976a,b) </ref>. <p> Instead, at those relative phases where X cells exhibit a null response, Y cells exhibit an on-off, or frequency doubling response, i.e., they respond equally to introduction and withdrawal of the grating. Similar results hold for other types of spatial and temporal modulation functions <ref> (Hochstein and Shapley, 1976a,b) </ref>. This result is in direct disaccord with the analytical finding of the last section: equation (30) predicts that a null response will obtain at 90 ffi regardless of parameter choice.

Reference-contexts: Although there is general agreement that retinal cells can be subdivided into these broad classes, morphological and anatomical studies have shown the existence of a great number of cell types within each class, including dozens of RGC and amacrine cell types <ref> (e.g., Kolb et al., 1981) </ref>. In addition to morphological and anatomical classification schemes, physiological studies have shown the existence of broad functional classes. Kuffler (1953) and Barlow (1953) first reported the existence of two RGC classes: on-center (ON) and off-center (OFF) cells.

Reference-contexts: (1966) sparked a wave of qualitative and quantitative experiments on RGC response, and although a number of qualitative and quantitative RGC RF models have been proposed, the qualitative nonlinear receptive field model of Hochstein and Shapley (1976b) is still considered to be the authoritative account of the Y-cell's receptive fields <ref> (Lennie et al., 1990, p. 112) </ref>. The push-pull, distance-dependent, feed-forward shunting network (14) may instead provide a framework for a unified quantitative explanation of the behavior of both X and Y cells in response to spatiotemporally modulated inputs.

Reference-contexts: Cone activation has opposite effects on each bipolar within a pair, and there is evidence that the bipolars within each pair in turn have opposite effects on the RGC they contact <ref> (Sterling, 1990) </ref>. These converging push-pull bipolar pathways coexist with and overlap the well-known diverging bipolar pathways that give rise to ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cell classes (Fig. 5b). Similar push-pull bipolar!RGC connections also appear to exist for the ON- and OFF-alpha RGC classes (Freed and Sterling, 1988).

Reference-contexts: Grossberg (1980) has also shown that the region of maximal sensitivity of a cell obeying (1) shifts without compression as the background intensity is parametrically increased. This is known as the shift property, which has been demonstrated experimentally for certain classes of retinal cells <ref> (Werblin, 1971) </ref>. 2 Similar results ensue when the center-surround mechanism consists of distinct, overlapping center and surround components, as shown in Fig. 1b.
