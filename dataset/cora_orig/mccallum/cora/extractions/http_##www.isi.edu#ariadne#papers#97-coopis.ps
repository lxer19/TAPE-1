Abstract: To simplify the task of obtaining information from the vast number of information sources that are available on the World Wide Web (WWW), we are building information mediators for extracting and integrating data from multiple Web sources. In a mediator based approach, wrappers are built around individual information sources to translate between the mediator query language and the individual sources. We present an approach for semi-automatically generating wrappers for structured internet sources. The key idea is to exploit formatting information in Web pages to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. We demonstrate the ease with which we are able to build wrappers for a number of Web sources using our implemented wrapper generation toolkit.

We were then able to pose queries to Ariadne such as `` Find the External debt and Defense expenditures of all countries in the EEC.'' The answer given by the mediator is shown in Figure 7. 5.

Reference-contexts: With their approach, the user provides actions for the system to execute when a query matches a certain template or format. This approach provides a way of rapidly constructing wrappers by example, but it could require a large number of examples to specify a single source. Doorenbos et al. <ref> [6] </ref> developed an Internet comparison shopping agent that can automatically build wrappers for Web sites. Since they focus on pages that contain items for sale, they make much stronger assumptions about the type of information they are looking for and use that information to hypothesize the underlying structure.

Reference-contexts: Capability to retrieve data over the network. Currently we are using PERL scripts for the purpose of making HTTP connections to the Web information sources and retrieving data from them. 3. Communication between the mediator and wrapper. We are using the agent communication language KQML <ref> [8] </ref> for the purpose of providing interprocess communication between the mediator and a wrapper. Adding the above functionality is the final step in generating a wrapper for a new source.

Reference-contexts: Related work Generating wrappers for databases and Web sources, and providing database like querying for semi-structured data are research areas that have received considerable attention recently. Hammer et al. <ref> [9] </ref> developed a template-based approach to generating wrappers for Web sources and other types of legacy systems. With their approach, the user provides actions for the system to execute when a query matches a certain template or format.

Reference-contexts: Such a parser can be automatically generated, since all of the grammatical and lexical information needed to parse the page is obtained at the structuring step. The compiler generator YACC <ref> [10] </ref> and the tool LEX are used for this purpose. The tokens identified in the structuring step are directly input as specifications to LEX to generate a lexical analyzer for a page from the source.

Reference-contexts: Their wrapper language is not very expressive and the system is quite limited in terms of the types of pages for which it can generate wrappers. Kushmerick et al. <ref> [13] </ref> also developed an approach to automatically generating wrappers. The focus of their work is very similar to ours i.e., building wrappers for Web sources to be integrated by a software agent.

Reference-contexts: They may also be written entirely in upper case words, or may end with a colon. We can generate a lexical analyzer that searches a page for such tokens using LEX <ref> [14] </ref>, a lexical analyzer generator. In Table 1 we list the regular expressions given as specifications to LEX to identify tokens indicating headings on a page. From these specifications we generate a lexical analyzer that identifies words or phrases conforming to the regular expressions.

Reference-contexts: We are working on adding capabilities to the system to quickly learn the structure of a new kind of heading from a few user examples. We are applying techniques for inducing Hidden Markov models (HMMs), describing the tokens, from corpora of positive examples. The basic idea, described in <ref> [17] </ref> is to start with an HMM accepting only the initial tokens marked by the user. Then, states in the HMM are merged to yield a generalized model that can be used to identify the remaining tokens in the page.
