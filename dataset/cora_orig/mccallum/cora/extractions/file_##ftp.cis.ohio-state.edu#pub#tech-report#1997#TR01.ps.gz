Abstract: Tech Report OSU-CISRC-1/97-TR01, Comp. & Info. Sci., Ohio State U., 1997 1 Abstract Many important physical phenomena, such as temperature distribution, air flow, and acoustic waves, are described as continuous, distributed parameter fields. Controlling and optimizing these physical processes and systems are common design tasks in many scientific and engineering domains. However, the challenges are multifold: distributed fields are conceptually harder to reason about than lumped parameter models; computational methods are prohibitively expensive for complex spatial domains; the underlying physics imposes severe constraints on observability and controllability. This paper develops an ontological abstraction and an aggregation-disaggregation mechanism, in a framework collectively known as spatial aggregation (SA), for reasoning about and synthesizing distributed control schemes for physical fields. The ontological abstraction models physical fields as networks of spatial objects. The aggregation-disaggregation mechanism employs a set of data types and generic operators to find a feasible control structure, specifying control placement and associated actions that satisfy given constraints. SA abstracts common computational patterns of control design and optimization in a small number of operators to support modular programming; it builds concise and articulable structural descriptions for physical fields. We illustrate the use of the SA ontological abstraction and operators in an example of regulating a thermal field in industrial heat treatment.

Reference-contexts: This work has significantly extended the previously developed SA framework for data interpretation <ref> [17, 1] </ref> to address new problems arising from control and optimization of distributed parameter physical fields. Numerical design and optimization methods must solve large systems of equations obtained from an appropriate discretization of a physical field. <p> We need to develop abstractions and operators that formalize the physical intuition so as to explicitly model field granularity and permit principled and programmed trade-offs among different design choices. SA provides the field ontology that represents a physical field as a network of spatial objects <ref> [17, 1] </ref>. Each spatial object comprises a geometric description for its spatial extent and a feature description for its values. For instance, a spatial object in a temperature field describes a location and the temperature at that location. <p> An even more advanced strategy interleaves aggregation and disaggregation so as to exploit the advantages of both. The spatial aggregation language provides aggregate, classify, and redescribe operators for hierarchically building source aggregates <ref> [1] </ref>. For brevity, we omit the code for aggregation-based design, concentrating instead on the disaggregation-based approach. Disaggregation-based design is an iterative process, repeatedly disaggregating unsatisfactory sources. The spatial aggregation operator update specifies iterative processes by repeatedly applying user-specified update rules until convergence is reached. <p> It also differs from many neural net based learning and optimization methods in that SA explicitly models and exploits field topological structures. This paper develops SA mechanisms for controlling physical fields that significantly extend the framework developed in <ref> [17, 1] </ref>. 5 Conclusions This paper advances the state-of-the-art in qualitative physics and spatial reasoning in several ways. It has developed the SA ontological abstraction for distributed parameter physical fields and an aggregation-disaggregation mechanism for synthesizing structures and parameters for distributed control of the fields.

Reference-contexts: Because of the rapid advance in micro-fabrication technology that can integrate and produce micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices on a massive scale, we are becoming increasingly reliant on large networks of sensors, actuators, and computational elements to augment our ability to interact with and control the physical environment <ref> [2] </ref>. However, it is hard to control and optimize physical fields using networks of sensors and controllers. The difficulties arise from three sources. First, a distributed parameter field is conceptually harder to reason about and model than a lumped parameter system such as a circuit.

Reference-contexts: SA can also describe adaptive aggregation in dynamic programming where states and their dependencies are grouped into meta-states according to residual errors <ref> [3] </ref>. We have described steady-state control problems for a class of physical fields such as heat conduction, gravity, electrostatics, and incompressible fluid flow that are governed by elliptic partial differential equations. To apply SA to transient problems, we need to develop techniques for tracking and correlating temporal objects.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, traditional numerical simulations require humans to interpret and explain the results. Unlike control design for lumped parameter, linear systems, few analytic design techniques have been developed for distributed control of large physical fields <ref> [12] </ref>. In practice, the design is often accomplished by brute-force numerical simulations. SA offers a powerful modeling framework and an alternative mechanism for synthesizing decentralized control. The multi-resolutional SA model is particularly useful for formulating structural design problems that are not well covered by numerical methods.

Reference-contexts: Second, numerical methods developed for designing and controlling physical fields require solving large systems of equations and hence are prohibitively expensive for large, irregular geometric domains and highly non-uniform, nonlinear phenomena.

Reference-contexts: The field values are determined by a local relaxation method that iteratively updates spatial objects using the local constraints. With these two field partitions, the SA abstraction mechanism subsumes the finite difference and finite element models commonly used in engineering and science <ref> [15] </ref>. We note that the SA representation has several unique advantages. First, SA supports many important reasoning and controlling tasks for physical fields, in addition to approximating the field. Second, SA solves the field locally, without the need to establish explicit, global models.
