Abstract: The bandwidth problem is the problem of numbering the vertices of a given graph G such that the maximum difference between two numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. The problem is known to be NP-complete [Pa 76] and there are only few algorithms for rather special cases of the problem [HMM 91] [Kr 87] [Sa 80] [Sm 95]. In this paper we present a randomized 3-approximation algorithm for the bandwidth problem restricted to dense graphs and a randomized 2-approximation algorithm for the same problem on directed dense graphs.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present the first constant approximation ratio algorithm for ffi-dense graphs. In particular we construct a 3-approximation algorithm. We call a graph G ffi-dense, if the minimum degree ffi (G) is at least ffin (see e.g. <ref> [AKK 95] </ref>). To introduce our method, we describe in Section 2 a weaker version of the algorithm namely a 4-approximation algorithm. It uses as one of its building-blocks the construction of perfect matchings in bipartite graphs. <p> We were not able to prove any constant ratio approximation of the bandwidth for dense in average graphs (see <ref> [AKK 95] </ref>) having fi (n 2 ) edges. For this case however we were able to prove NP-hardness. Acknowledgment We thank Sanjeev Arora and Haim Kaplan for helpful discussions.

However this algorithm seems to be far away from being practical and the running time P M (G) of the perfect matching algorithm will be dominated by the rest.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding the bandwidth of a graph is NP-complete [Pa 76], even for trees with maximum degree 3 <ref> [GGJK 78] </ref>. The general problem is not known to have any sublinear n * -approximation algorithms. There are only few cases where we can find the optimal layout in polynomial time. <p> There are only few cases where we can find the optimal layout in polynomial time. Saxe [Sa 80] designed an algorithm which decides whether a given graph has bandwidth at most k in time O (n k ) by dynamic programming. Bandwidth two can be checked in linear time <ref> [GGJK 78] </ref>. Kratsch [Kr 87] introduced an exact O (n 2 log n) algorithm for the bandwidth problem in interval graphs. Smithline [Sm 95] proved that the bandwidth of the complete k-ary tree T k;d with d levels and k d leaves is exactly dk (k d 1)=(k 1)(2d)e.

Reference-contexts: In this way the bandwidth and the bandwidth sum [Ha 64] problems were born (at least for a special graph class).
