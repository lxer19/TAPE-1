Abstract: When designing real-time communication protocols, the primary objective is to guarantee the deadlines of synchronous messages while sustaining a high aggregate throughput. In this paper, we study two token ring protocols for their suitability in real-time systems. The priority driven protocol (e.g., IEEE 802.5) allows implementation of a priority based real-time scheduling discipline like the rate monotonic algorithm. The timed token protocol (e.g., FDDI) provides guaranteed bandwidth and bounded access time for synchronous messages. We study these two protocols by deriving their schedulability conditions, i.e., the conditions which determine whether a given message set can be guaranteed. Using these conditions, we evaluate the average performance of these protocols under different operating conditions. We observe that neither protocol dominates the other for the entire range of the system parameter space. We conclude that the priority driven protocol performs better for bandwidths in the range of 1-10 Mbit/s while the timed token protocol has a superior performance at higher bandwidths.

Reference-contexts: A token is passed from node to node around the ring, allowing the stations to transmit in a round robin fashion. Capacity control in this protocol is also implemented using timers. This protocol has been employed in network standards such as the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) <ref> [1] </ref>, the High-Speed Data Bus and the High-Speed Ring Bus (HSDB/HSRB) [20, 21, 33], and the Survivable Adaptable Fiber Optic Embedded Network (SAFENET) [6, 17]. 1.2 Objectives of this study The objectives of this study are twofold.

However, in each token rotation, there are fixed overheads. Thus, a smaller value of TTRT 5 Also referred as synchronous capacity in the literature <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>. We use the term synchronous bandwidth, in accordance with the most recent version of the FDDI standard. 14 means less synchronous bandwidth to individual nodes and a higher over-head.

Reference-contexts: Capacity control is achieved by setting a token holding timer at each station. Messages are divided into fixed sized frames and the station holding the token can transmit its frames until its token holding timer expires. This protocol has been employed in the IEEE 802.5 standard <ref> [8] </ref>. * The Timed Token Protocol (TTP). This protocol uses a simple access arbitration policy. A token is passed from node to node around the ring, allowing the stations to transmit in a round robin fashion. Capacity control in this protocol is also implemented using timers. <p> This protocol has been incorporated into the IEEE 802.5 standard <ref> [8] </ref>. We then discuss an implementation of the rate monotonic algorithm [15] with this protocol. We also consider a modified version of the IEEE 802.5 standard which provides a more efficient implementation of priority arbitration. <p> Once a station captures the token, it can transmit its frames one after the other until its token holding timer expires. It then transmits a fresh token with the token priority field set to the highest known priority of pending messages on the ring. The reader is referred to <ref> [8, 27] </ref> for further details on the protocol operation. 3.2 Parameter settings The effectiveness of this protocol in guaranteeing the deadlines of synchronous messages depends on the choice of proper values for three parameters: the message priorities, the message frame length, and the token holding timer value at each station. *

Reference-contexts: The choice of Media Access Control (MAC) protocol determines how real-time messages can be scheduled for transmission over the ring. A MAC protocol can be considered to be an entity which implements two specific policies: an access arbitration policy and a capacity control policy <ref> [16] </ref>. In token ring networks, a station gains access to transmission medium by capturing a circulating token. The access arbitration policy determines when a station on the ring may capture the token, influencing the order in which stations receive service. <p> A preliminary comparison of the two protocols based on average breakdown utilization alone was presented in [10].

Reference-contexts: Implementation of the rate monotonic algorithm on an IEEE 802.5 token ring was first proposed by Strosnider, Lehoczky, and Sha [30]. The timed token protocol was first proposed by Grow in [7]. Sevcik and Johnson <ref> [23] </ref> formally demonstrated that this protocol ensures a bounded access time for all stations on the ring. The issue of guaranteeing the deadlines of synchronous real-time messages with this protocol has been addressed recently in [2, 3, 4]. <p> arrives; that is, if a message in stream S i arrives at time t, then its deadline is at time t + P i . 2 The priority arbitration process will be described in Section 3.1. 3 The time to transmit a single asynchronous frame is known as asynchronous overrun <ref> [23] </ref>. It reduces the amount of time available for transmission of synchronous messages during a token cycle of the timed token protocol. 5 3. The payload length of each message in stream S i is C i , which is the amount of time needed to transmit this message. <p> Transmission of an asynchronous frame once begun will always be completed. The time needed to transmit one asynchronous frame is known as the asynchronous overrun and reduces the effective bandwidth available for transmission of synchronous messages <ref> [23] </ref>. 4.2 Parameter settings The performance of this protocol depends on the selection of appropriate values for the following parameters: the TTRT , the synchronous bandwidths of individual stations, the synchronous message frame length, and the asynchronous message frame length. * TTRT selection. <p> Previous studies [9] on choosing an appropriate TTRT value have considered network models with purely asynchronous loading. The issue of selecting TTRT for a real-time environment has not been addressed in the literature so far. As shown in <ref> [23] </ref>, the time between two successive token visits to a station can be at most 2 TTRT . Hence, TTRT should be less than half of the minimum period. <p> That is, n X H i TTRT t (15) where t denotes the sum of various protocol overheads which reduce the actual time available for transmission of data during one typical token rotation duration. The value of t is obtained as <ref> [23] </ref> t = fi + F (16) where F denotes the time to transmit an asynchronous frame and is known as the asynchronous overrun [23]. This constraint must be met to ensure the proper working of the protocol. 2. The Deadline Constraint. <p> The value of t is obtained as <ref> [23] </ref> t = fi + F (16) where F denotes the time to transmit an asynchronous frame and is known as the asynchronous overrun [23]. This constraint must be met to ensure the proper working of the protocol. 2. The Deadline Constraint. This constraint states that the synchronous messages must always be transmitted before their deadlines.

Reference-contexts: Once a station captures the token, it can transmit its frames one after the other until its token holding timer expires. It then transmits a fresh token with the token priority field set to the highest known priority of pending messages on the ring. The reader is referred to <ref> [8, 27] </ref> for further details on the protocol operation. 3.2 Parameter settings The effectiveness of this protocol in guaranteeing the deadlines of synchronous messages depends on the choice of proper values for three parameters: the message priorities, the message frame length, and the token holding timer value at each station. *

Further, this algorithm can be applied to token rings <ref> [30] </ref>. Thus, the synchronous messages are assigned priorities in the inverse order of their periods. * Choice of frame size. The rate monotonic algorithm requires that a node with a high priority message be able to preempt the transmission of a lower priority message.
