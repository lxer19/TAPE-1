Reference-contexts: Computing t-sparse shifts and the representation of f (x) in the basis 1; x ff; (x ff) 2 ; . . . was raised as an open problem in <ref> (Borodin-Tiwari 1990) </ref>. Subsequently, the problem was taken up in a recent paper by Grigoriev and Karpinski (Grigoriev-Karpinski 1993) where they provide an elegant algebraic criterion to be satisfied by any t-sparse shift for f (x): We use that paper as our starting point for further refinement.

This is indeed a much stronger requirement than the requirement in <ref> (Grigoriev-Karpinski 1993) </ref> that only a black box for f (x) be given.

Reference-contexts: rational functions can be evaluated quickly and that makes them attractive to several applications and an interesting line of research is to try to infer properties of sparse polynomials (such as divisibility, existence of non-trivial gcd, the existence of real roots etc.) from their values at a small number points <ref> (see Grigoriev-Karpinski 1992a) </ref>. Sparse univariate polynomial interpolation in the Chebyshev basis is treated in (Lakshman-Saunders 1992) and a different generalized sparse interpolation algorithm that works for a class of bases can be found in (Grigoriev-Karpinski-Singer 1991b).

Reference-contexts: If f (x) is given by a straight-line program, then a straight-line program for the first 2t derivatives can be obtained by a polynomial sized blow-up in the length of the straight-line program for computing f (x) <ref> (Kaltofen 1987) </ref>. Then the algorithm developed in this paper can be used to compute a sparse shift for f (x); provided one exists.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 contains a description of the sparse decomposition algorithm. Proofs of several lemmas are omitted from this abstract. Complete proofs of all the lemmas and theorems can be found in the full paper <ref> (Lakshman-Saunders 1993) </ref>. 1. <p> This follows from an analogue of Descartes' rule of signs for polynomials ex pressed in the falling Pochhammer basis. The details of this fairly extensive argument may be found in the full paper <ref> (Lakshman-Saunders 1993) </ref>. 2 Theorem 1 Let f (x) 2 F [x] be of degree d and let t (d + 1)=2: If there exists an ff in some algebraic extension K of F such that f (x) is t-sparse in the shifted power basis 1; (x ff); (x ff) 2 ; <p> The test hinges on how often two shifted sparse polynomials (with possibly different sparse shifts) can have the same value at real points away from their sparse shifts. We summarize our main observations in the following lemmas and theorem 3 below. Complete proofs can be found in <ref> (Lakshman-Saunders 1993) </ref>. Let H (x) = i=1 h i x i be t-sparse in the standard power basis.

Reference-contexts: The square-free part of the gcd can be computed within the same bounds on the number of operations. Step 2 can be performed in O (t 3 ) operations, step 3 in O (t 2 log d) operations <ref> (Loos 1983) </ref>. The linear system to be solved in Step 4 is a very special, Vandermonde-like system and can be solved in O (t 2 ) steps.
