Abstract: We describe an improved version of Shen's Theorem bounding the Hamming distance of a multivariate function from the space of low degree polynomials in terms of its distances from functions that are polynomials in one of their variables. The latter quantities can be estimated easily by statistical tests. The new bound results in more efficient low degree tests, a key ingredient of transparent proofs.

A smaller constant a would reduce the number of necessary rounds. 4 Proof of the theorem We shall use the following result from <ref> [AS] </ref>, Lemma 4.1 (Arora, Safra) Let f 2 P 1 (n; k) and assume that there exist c 1 ; : : : ; c 2k 2 I, such that d (f j x 1 =c i ; P (n 1; k)) t 1=8 and jIj &gt; 11nk 2 : Let <p> polynomial to f and ff the fraction of lines parallel to the x 1 axis containing points x where f (x) 6= g (x): Then ff 2t: 3 A consequence is that in this case d (f; P (n; k)) 2t: With t = 1=10 this is Lemma 10 in <ref> [AS] </ref>. Proof Let g i 2 P (n 1; k) be the closest to fj x 1 =c i . Let g be the degree k extension of g 1 ; : : : ; g k+1 to I n . Then g 2 P (n; k).

The aim of this note is to give an improvement of Shen's Theorem, using an idea of Arora and Safra [AS].

Reference-contexts: One round uses log n + n log jIj = O (n log jIj) random bits. Repeating this m times would be O (mn log jIj) random bits. If we apply the trick of <ref> [IZ] </ref>, O (n log jIj + m) = O (n log n + n=") random bits suffice. Remark In general from an estimate of the form d (f; P (n; k)) a i=1 it follows that the choice &lt; "=2 and m = O (an=") guarantees small error probability.
