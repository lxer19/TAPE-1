Abstract: A new protocol is presented that controls the quality-of-service of simplex end-to-end packet streams ("flows") in a TCP/IP based internetwork. The protocol, called TReg for Transport Regulation, limits the use of network resources by a rate control mechanism implemented at the traffic sources. The set of flows is partitioned into different traffic classes based on the application type, e.g., video traffic, audio traffic, or bulk data. The rate control mechanisms at the traffic sources adapt to the current traffic load such that flows with in the same traffic class obtain the same quality-of-service (Relative Quality-of-Service).

For example, in the schemes investigated in [3, 5], all flows whose throughput is limited by the same network resource have identical throughput constraints.

Reference-contexts: Since TReg uses the standard TCP and UDP protocols for data transfer and control, it can be installed onto any network that uses the TCP/IP protocol suite. The application programming interface of TReg is almost identical to the widely used BSD Socket <ref> [4] </ref> interface. Thus, any application program that uses BSD sockets for communication can be easily converted to TReg with minimal changes to the source code. Finally, the implementation of TReg does not require any changes to the kernel of the hosts' operating systems.

Reference-contexts: The rate-controller at a flow source is a variation of the leaky bucket <ref> [7] </ref> that restricts the maximum traffic rate of a flow source. In our implementation, credits are added to the leaky bucket only up to a maximum number of credits. A packet is only transmitted if sufficient credits are available, and each packet transmission reduces the number of credits.
