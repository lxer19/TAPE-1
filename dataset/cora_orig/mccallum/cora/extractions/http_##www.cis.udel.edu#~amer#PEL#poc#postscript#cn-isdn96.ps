Abstract: This paper presents an analytic model for investigating the throughput, delay and buffer utilization characteristics of partially ordered transport services. We analyze the effects of packet and ack losses as well as applications' order requirements on overall system performance. The analytic model is verified by comparing its results against those of an OPNET simulation model. Analytic results show that for applications that can tolerate some reordering in the delivery of objects, use of partially ordered service instead of ordered service provides important buffer utilization and delay improvements, particularly as the loss rate increases and the order requirements of applications decrease. In terms of throughput, it makes no difference which service (i.e., ordered, partially ordered, unordered) an application uses. Analytic study also shows that by judicious choice of sender's transmission order, overall system performance can further be improved in a partially ordered service.

Reference-contexts: For simulation study of partially ordered transport services, we built an OPNET-based simulation model at the University of Delaware's Protocol Engineering Lab. OPNET (OPtimize Network Engineering Tools) is a comprehensive engineering system capable of simulating large communication networks with detailed protocol modeling and performance analysis <ref> [2] </ref>. For the verification process of analytic model, we run three different sets of experiments each of which testing a different hypothesis of the analytic model. It is important to state that these four hypotheses were all developed based only on the analytic model and before any simulation were run.

That is, any valid LE of P O is permitted. Does the choice of which LE is used by POC Sender affect the expected performance? In this section, we will address this question by comparing the performance of different LEs of a P O.

Reference-contexts: Thus, both the order and the reliability requirements of the applications are generalized in POC. Previous study has formally confirmed the intuitive results that, in general, a partially reliable service provides lower delay and higher throughput than a reliable service <ref> [9] </ref>. This paper analytically studies the partially ordered aspect of POC. This analytic study basically has the following goals: 1.

Reference-contexts: We only have an approximate expression for pSB b1::bm;a when m 2 in <ref> [10] </ref>.
