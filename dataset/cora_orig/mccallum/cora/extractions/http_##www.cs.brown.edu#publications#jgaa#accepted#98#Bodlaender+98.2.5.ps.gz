Abstract: We show that the minimum fill-in and the minimum interval graph completion of a d-trapezoid graph can be computed in time O(n d ). We also show that the treewidth and the pathwidth of a d-trapezoid graph can be computed in time O(n tw(G) d1 ). In both cases, d is supposed to be a fixed positive integer and it is required that a suitable intersection model of the given d-trapezoid graph is part of the input.

Reference-contexts: One reason for this interest is that many well known and important graph problems become polynomial time, and usually even linear time solvable (and become member of NC), when restricted to a class of graphs with bounded tree- or pathwidth <ref> [1, 3, 4, 5, 7] </ref>. In general, such algorithms need to have a tree-decomposition or path-decomposition of suitable width given together with the input graph. Hence, an important problem is to find tree-decompositions (or path-decompositions) of minimum width.

Reference-contexts: The Treewidth (resp.

(For information on graph classes we refer to [11, 19]. <p> For d 3, our algorithms for d-trapezoid graphs require an intersection model as part of the input. This is clearly a disadvantage although it is a quite natural assumption. On one hand, all four problems that we consider are NP-complete on cocomparability graphs <ref> [2, 36] </ref>, hence there is no polynomial time algorithm for d-trapezoid graphs if the parameter d is unbounded, unless L. Bodlaender et al., d-trapezoid graphs, JGAA, 2 (5) 1-23 (1998) 4 P=NP. On the other hand, the recognition problem for d-trapezoid graphs is NP-complete for any fixed d 3 [35]. <p> The decision problems Treewidth and Pathwidth are NP-complete <ref> [2] </ref>. However, for constant k, graphs with treewidth or pathwidth at most k are recognizable in O (n) time [6, 8]. The large constants depending on k involved in these algorithms make them usually not practical.

Reference-contexts: Hence, an important problem is to find tree-decompositions (or path-decompositions) of minimum width. When the desired width of the tree-decomposition is bounded by a constant, then this problem can be solved in linear time <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the constant factor of this algorithm is exponential in the treewidth (of yes-instances), which limits its practicality. Thus, it is interesting for special classes of graphs to find algorithms, which are also polynomial in the treewidth. A related graph problem is the Minimum Fill-in problem. <p> The decision problems Treewidth and Pathwidth are NP-complete [2].

Reference-contexts: For other definitions we refer to Section 2.) For various special classes of graphs, it has been shown that the treewidth can be computed in polynomial time, as e.g. cographs [10], circular-arc graphs [32], chordal bipartite graphs [22], permutation graphs <ref> [9] </ref>, circle graphs [20] and cointerval graphs [17]. The knowledge on the algorithmic complexity of the Minimum Fill-in problem when restricted to special graph classes is relatively small compared to that of Treewidth and Pathwidth. <p> In Theorem 17 we establish a representation theorem of minimal triangulations of a d-trapezoid graph G in terms of scanlines of a d-trapezoid diagram D (G). Hence in contrast to previous work in this area as e.g. <ref> [9, 20, 28, 32] </ref>, our algorithms are based on a general representation theorem that enables the design of an algorithm for Treewith, Minimum Fill-in and possibly related problems (concerning the optimization of a graph parameter over all minimal triangulations of the graph). <p> A similar algorithm to compute the treewidth and the pathwidth for permutation graphs has been presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. For d 3, our algorithms for d-trapezoid graphs require an intersection model as part of the input. This is clearly a disadvantage although it is a quite natural assumption. <p> For designing efficient treewidth algorithms on special graph classes that do not have bounded treewidth, vertex separators of bounded size have been replaced by minimal separators (see, e.g., <ref> [9, 21] </ref>). Definition 8 Let G = (V; E) be a graph. A subset S V is an a; b-separator for nonadjacent vertices a and b, if the removal of S separates a and b in distinct connected components. <p> problems of this paper are easy for interval graphs.) Scanlines as a tool to represent all minimal separators of a graph have been used in various efficient algorithms to compute the treewidth or the minimum fill-in for special classes of intersection graphs, among them permutation, d-trapezoid, circle and circular-arc graphs <ref> [9, 20, 21, 24, 28] </ref>. Definition 14 Let G = (V; E) be a graph on n vertices with d-trapezoid diagram D (G). <p> The scanline s 1 is between Q u and Q v if either r i u &lt; s i v , v &lt; s i u , for all i 2 f1; 2; : : :; dg. The following results extend corresponding ones for permutation graphs given in <ref> [9] </ref>. Some ideas of the proof of Theorem 15 will be reused in the proof of our main structural theorem in Section 4. Definition 16 Let s be a scanline of a d-trapezoid diagram D (G). <p> The approach taken to prove this theorem differs completely from the techniques used to prove related theorems in previous work as e.g. <ref> [9, 20, 24] </ref>. Definition 17 Let D (G) be a d-trapezoid diagram of a graph G. <p> However the tools that we develop in the next section allow us to exploit the information of the d-trapezoid diagram more cleverly. As a consequence we obtain significantly faster algorithms. 5 Small scanlines and dense sequences The notion of a small scanline has been introduced in <ref> [9] </ref>. It is useful in a treewidth algorithm since a minimal separator S with jSj &gt; k + 1 can not be made into a clique for obtaining a minimal triangulation H with !(H) k. L.

Hence pw (G) = tw (G) and mfi (G) = mic (G) for each asteroidal triple-free graph. Any d-trapezoid graph is a cocomparability graph (see Section 3) and thus asteroidal triple-free.

Definition 1 A graph is chordal if it has no induced chordless cycle of length at least four. <p> Using the characterization in Theorem 2, one can easily identify the minimal separators of an interval graph which has been shown in <ref> [23] </ref>. Lemma 5 Let A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A q be a consecutive clique arrangement of an interval graph G. Then the minimal separators of G are the sets A i " A i+1 , i 2 f1; 2; : : :; q 1g. <p> Theorem 6 Let H be a triangulation of a graph G. Then H is a minimal triangulation of G if and only if for all edges e 2 E (H) n E (G) the graph H e is not chordal. Theorem 7 provides another characterization of minimal triangulations (see <ref> [23] </ref>). Definition 10 Let G = (V; E) be a graph.

Preliminaries on treewidth, pathwidth, minimum fill-in, minimal separators and triangulations are given in Section 2. <p> A similar representation theorem is given in <ref> [24] </ref> for circle and circular-arc graphs. In Section 5 we introduce so-called small scanlines and dense sequences of scanlines as tools to obtain significantly faster algorithms than by a straightforward application of the representation theorem. <p> problems of this paper are easy for interval graphs.)

Definition 14 Let G = (V; E) be a graph on n vertices with d-trapezoid diagram D (G). <p> The approach taken to prove this theorem differs completely from the techniques used to prove related theorems in previous work as e.g. <ref> [9, 20, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For d = 2 we can drop the requirement that a 2-trapezoid diagram must be part of the input since there is an O (n 2 ) recognition algorithm for trapezoid graphs that also computes a trapezoid model if the input graph is a trapezoid graph <ref> [25] </ref>. (Notice that interval graphs are of no interest to us since the four problems of this paper are easy for interval graphs.)

Reference-contexts: In Theorem 17 we establish a representation theorem of minimal triangulations of a d-trapezoid graph G in terms of scanlines of a d-trapezoid diagram D (G). Hence in contrast to previous work in this area as e.g. <ref> [9, 20, 28, 32] </ref>, our algorithms are based on a general representation theorem that enables the design of an algorithm for Treewith, Minimum Fill-in and possibly related problems (concerning the optimization of a graph parameter over all minimal triangulations of the graph). <p> The algorithm to compute the minimum fill-in and the minimum interval completion has running time O (n d ).

Furthermore we obtain an O (n 2 ) algorithm to compute the minimum fill-in of permutation graphs (compared to running time O (n 5 ) of the algorithm for bipartite permutation graphs in [31]). <p> problems of this paper are easy for interval graphs.)

Reference-contexts: The importance of this problem lies mainly in the fact that it is equivalent to finding an order of Gaussian elimination steps of a (usually sparse) symmetric matrix, minimizing the number of generated non-zero entries <ref> [29] </ref>. Due to the lack of efficient algorithms for finding an optimal solution, in practice one usually has to work with certain heuristics. By now there is a large number of results on the algorithmic complexity of the problems Treewidth and Pathwidth when restricted to special graph classes.

Reference-contexts: For other definitions we refer to Section 2.) For various special classes of graphs, it has been shown that the treewidth can be computed in polynomial time, as e.g. cographs [10], circular-arc graphs <ref> [32] </ref>, chordal bipartite graphs [22], permutation graphs [9], circle graphs [20] and cointerval graphs [17]. The knowledge on the algorithmic complexity of the Minimum Fill-in problem when restricted to special graph classes is relatively small compared to that of Treewidth and Pathwidth. <p> In Theorem 17 we establish a representation theorem of minimal triangulations of a d-trapezoid graph G in terms of scanlines of a d-trapezoid diagram D (G).

Reference-contexts: The Minimum Fill-in problem `Given a graph G and a positive integer k, decide whether there is a fill-in of G with at most k edges' remains NP-complete on cobipartite graphs [36] and on bipartite graphs <ref> [33] </ref>. The only graph classes for which the Minimum Fill-in problem were known to be polynomial time solvable were for almost ten years the relatively small classes of cographs [13] and bipartite permutation graphs [31].

Reference-contexts: Consequently as already mentioned in Corollary 10, the treewidth and pathwidth of a d-trapezoid graph coincide, and the minimum fill-in and the minimum interval graph completion of a d-trapezoid graph coincide. Details about the terminology used in Theorem 14 and the remarks above can be found in <ref> [34] </ref>. The definition of a d-trapezoid diagram implies that 1-trapezoid graphs and interval graphs coincide and that 2-trapezoid graphs and trapezoid graphs coin L.

Reference-contexts: Bodlaender et al., d-trapezoid graphs, JGAA, 2 (5) 1-23 (1998) 4 P=NP. On the other hand, the recognition problem for d-trapezoid graphs is NP-complete for any fixed d 3 <ref> [35] </ref>. Thus, for d 3, to compute a d-trapezoid diagram, whenever the input graph is a d-trapezoid graph, means to solve an NP-complete problem. Fortunately, a d-trapezoid diagram as part of the input is not a necessary assumption to establish algorithms with polynomial running time. <p> Theorem 14 The d-trapezoid graphs are exactly the cocomparability graphs of partially ordered sets of interval dimension at most d. Unfortunately, the problem `Given a partially ordered set P , decide whether the interval dimension of P is at most d' is NP-complete for any fixed d 3 <ref> [35] </ref>. Hence for fixed d 3, to compute a d-trapezoid diagram of the given graph, if it is indeed a d-trapezoid graph, means to solve an NP-complete problem. Moreover, at present not even reasonable approximation algorithms for the interval dimension of a partially ordered set are known.
