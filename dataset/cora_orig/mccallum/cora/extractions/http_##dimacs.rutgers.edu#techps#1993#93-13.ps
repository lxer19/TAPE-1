Title: Combinatorial Optimization and Computations in the Ring of Polynomials  
Author: Alexander I. Barvinok 
Date: March 12, 1993  
Note: Version of  
Abstract: We reduce a problem of Combinatorial Otimization to a computational problem in the ring of polynomials. As an application, we find new polynomially solvable classes of the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Weighted 3-Packing Problem. In particular, we show that for any fixed norm in a Euclidean space and for any fixed relative error one can compute the length of a longest Hamiltonian contour joining given points in polynomial time. We also design faster PSPACE algorithms for testing Hamiltonian graphs, for the 3-Packing Problem, and the Vertex Disjoint Paths Problem. We prove that the permanent of a matrix can be computed in polynomial time if we fix the rank of the matrix.

Reference-contexts: However, it is well-known that in some simplest situations there is no need in "translations". For example, the connection between the Shortest Path Problem and matrix multiplication is well studied (see, for example <ref> [1] </ref>). Another natural problem is to improve these algorithms and to get rid of some of their most disturbing shortcomings (like mentioned above). This probably requires a certain synthesis of algebraic and combinatorial technique.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we consider further applications of exponential sums (see, for example, <ref> [2] </ref>) to the problems of Combinatorial Optimization. We design polynomial time algorithms for some particular cases of the Traveling Salesman Problem and of the Weighted 3-Packing Problem and faster PSPACE algorithms for unweighted versions of these problems as well as for the Vertex Disjoint Paths Problem.

Reference-contexts: It is known (see <ref> [3] </ref>) that the (Weighted) 3-Packing Problem is NP-hard. Following the same ideas as before let us substitute formally "min" by " P P Q come to the following homogeneous polynomial in variables c (I) of degree m. (6.2) Hyperhafnian.

Reference-contexts: The method of dynamic pro gramming allows one to test a graph with the time complexity O (n 2 2 n ), however it uses 7 O (2 n ) memory (see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>) (since the basic idea is a reduction to subgraphs). The author can not provide any reference to an algorithm which would have a singly exponential in n time complexity and would use a polynomially bounded space. An immediate corollary of Theorem 3.6 is that such an algorithm does exist. <p> The method of dynamic programming would give us O (n 2 2 n ) time complexity (essentially the number of arithmetic operations) but it would require an exponentially large space (see <ref> [4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Permanent of a matrix of a small rank. Let A = (a ij ) : i; j = 1; : : : ; n be a real n fi n square matrix. The expression per A = g2S n i=1 is called permanent of A (see <ref> [5] </ref>). Here S n denotes the symmetric group, i.e. the group of all permutations of the set f1; : : : ; ng. <p> We call this polynomial hyperhafnian of the tensor C since its analogue for the 2-matchings sometimes is called hafnian (see <ref> [5] </ref>). As in the case of Hamiltonian permanent (see Section 3) it turns out that the hyper-hafnian can be computed in strongly polynomial time if we fix the rank of the tensor. (6.3) Definition. Let C 2 (IR n ) 3 be a cubic tensor.
