Abstract: Introspective reasoning about a system's own reasoning processes can form the basis for learning to refine those reasoning processes. The ROBBIE 1 system uses introspective reasoning to monitor the retrieval process of a case-based planner to detect retrieval of inappropriate cases. When retrieval problems are detected, the source of the problems is explained and the explanations are used to determine new indices to use during future case retrieval. The goal of ROBBIE's learning is to increase its ability to focus retrieval on relevant cases, with the aim of simultaneously decreasing the number of candidates to consider and increasing the likelihood that the system will be able to successfully adapt the retrieved cases to fit the current situation. We evaluate the benefits of the approach in light of empirical results examining the effects of index learning in the

Reference-contexts: Once a reasoning failure is detected the model is used to create an explanation of the failure and to suggest a repair (See <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1994 ] </ref> for a discussion of ROBBIE's failure detection). Currently, ROBBIE can learn new features to use in indexing memory, and can re-index its memory to pay attention to those features. <p> In addition, when ROBBIE chooses new indices, it uses knowledge of both the faulty retrieval and the case that should have been retrieved to guide the choice of new indices. This allows it to select indices that are useful to discriminate between the cases currently in its memory <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1994 ] </ref> . 7 Conclusions The ROBBIE system combines introspective reasoning with a case-based planner to create a system that not only learns new plans in response to its experiences, but also learns to plan better by learning new features to use in indexing.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a system that applies this process to refine the indices used for case retrieval in a case-based planning system. Our program, ROBBIE, combines a case-based planner as its performance system with an introspective reasoning component which monitors its reasoning and guides introspective learning <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1995; 1994 ] </ref> . Applying introspective reasoning to CBR is novel in that learning in CBR systems is generally focused on acquiring domain knowledge, by acquiring new cases. <p> These links are used in explaining failures and finding repairs by focusing on the most fruitful areas of inquiry. Assertions C and D in table 1 show an abstract assertion and its specification. The vocabulary for representing assertions uses simple predicate calculus formulations. In <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1995 ] </ref> we provide a detailed description of the model and the representation it uses, and describe in more detail the need for a hierarchy of assertions. <p> Stroulia uses a "Structure-Behavior-Function" model, a form originally designed for diagnosis of device failures, 4 The cost in development time expended to construct the introspective model is another issue, see <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1995 ] </ref> for a detailed discussion of model transfer. re-indexing, performance drops to a lower average percentage, with greater variation. (50% permuted sequence) to perform introspective reasoning about an underlying system [ Stroulia and Goel, 1994 ] . <p> ROBBIE uses a declarative model of the case-based reasoning process which provides expectations about its reasoning performance through assertions about the ideal reasoning and results. This model contains both general and specific assertions; the framework is designed to be applicable to other underlying systems and failures <ref> [ Fox and Leake, 1995 ] </ref> . In previous research, little has been done to quantitatively evaluate introspective reasoning beyond isolated examples. We have performed empirical analysis of ROBBIE to determine its performance by measuring the success rate and the reasoning efficiency.

RAPTER focuses on analysis of the reasoning trace of the planner, using "justification structures" which trace the chain of assumptions made by the system used to determine what to repair.

Reference-contexts: ROBBIE's model is designed to support failure detection as well as recovery, and facilitates that process through the types of assertions included and their organization. Oehlmann integrates introspective reasoning with the overall domain task in IULIAN: discovering answers to questions through experience or experimentation <ref> [ Oehlmann et al., 1994 ] </ref> . IULIAN contains plans for solving domain tasks, and introspective plans for controlling its reasoning process. It learns by applying these plans to its domain and reasoning tasks, and remembering the resulting successes or failures.

Reference-contexts: It learns by applying these plans to its domain and reasoning tasks, and remembering the resulting successes or failures. Cox implements introspective reasoning in Meta-AQUA by maintaining a set of reasoning trace templates (Meta-XPs) that describe different reasoning failures, and detecting reasoning failures that match a template <ref> [ Ram and Cox, 1994 ] </ref> . Meta-XPs provide the means for determining the failure and suggestions for repairs. In CBR research outside of introspective reasoning, multiple methods have been proposed for determining relevant indices.
