Title: PERFORMANCE DRIVEN GLOBAL ROUTING FOR STANDARD CELL DESIGN

Abstract: Advances in fabrication technology have resulted in a continual shrinkage of device dimensions. This has resulted in smaller device delays, greater resistance along interconnect wires, and a greater impact of interconnect on total system performance. These changes have driven a considerable number of studies on single-net interconnect optimization, but relatively little work has been done to integrate the results on single-net optimization with the problem of global routing and interconnect optimization for the entire circuit. In this paper, we present the DECIMATE global router for performance driven standard cell design. The router applies both interconnect topology optimization and variable-width wire sizing optimization results to the global routing problem, while maintaining routing areas that are comparable with TimberWolf Systems' well-known commercial global router. Optimal selection of interconnection structures is shown to be an NP-Hard problem; we provide a simple heuristic for the problem, and show that it is effective with experiments on industry benchmarks. Under the Elmore delay model, our global router produces as much as a 35% reduction in critical path delay over TimberWolf Systems' global router, while path length reductions are as large as 52%. Circuit area optimization is performed taking into account variably-sized wires, fixed routing topologies, and pre-existing obstacles; an improved cost function obtains as much as an 11.6% reduction in channel density over the result in [16].

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION With the advent of deep submicron design, a number of process parameters have changed, resulting in an increasing importance for interconnect optimization. Interconnect delay can now consume from 50% to 70% of the clock cycle in many cases <ref> [3] </ref>; reduction in interconnect delay will have a significant impact on the overall performance of the circuit. fl This work is partially supported by DARPA/ITO under Contract J-FBI-93-112 and NSF under Young Investigator Award MIP-9357582.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents the DECIMATE global router, which addresses both of these problems, and offers the following features. * Through the use of high performance interconnect topologies, the router addresses global path delay concerns for timing driven circuit design. We apply the topology algorithms of <ref> [14, 23, 5] </ref> and the wiresizing work of [15, 13] in our global router. * Area optimization takes into account both the timing--critical and non-timing-critical nets, as well as variable width routing and pre-existing congestion. <p> Thus, even if we do not constrain the overall cost, the problem of delay minimization can still be quite difficult. In our global router, we support minimum spanning trees, low area topologies (using the algorithms of [23] and <ref> [5] </ref>), high-performance topologies (using the algorithm from [14]), and also variable-width interconnect sizing (using the optimal wire-sizing algorithms from [13, 15]). <p> To motivate our use of minimum spanning trees for interconnect topologies, we first present Table 1, showing the percentage improvement of an algorithm based on the ERT Steiner tree heuristic of <ref> [5] </ref> over minimum spanning tree length. We consider the existence of equivalent pins, and take advantage of them to reduce tree length. <p> Not surprisingly, the slight difference in total tree length results in a slight difference in circuit area. In global routing experiments where we compare minimum spanning tree routing topologies to topologies determined by the ERT heuristic of <ref> [5] </ref>, circuit area results were identical. When we apply the 1-Steiner heuristic of [23], circuit area results are slightly worse, as this heuristic does not take advan tage of equivalent pins to reduce tree lengths or minimize feedthroughs.

Reference-contexts: When a wire is sized, the spacing does not increase. Therefore, a wire that is twice the minimum width takes less routing area than two parallel minimum width segments. In our current implementation, wire width is uniform within each segment; it was shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that when the length of segments were small, solutions had near optimal performance.

Reference-contexts: In [20], the authors use path-based timing constraints and utilize the features specific to bipolar design to optimize both the delay and area of the global routing result. The global router described in <ref> [16, 17] </ref> provides the basis for the work in this paper. It involves two phases, a constructive step in which feedthroughs are inserted, and an iterative deletion step which first constructs redundant connection graphs for each net, and then removes redundant edges to minimize overall channel density. <p> The assignment is improved by a greedy pairwise swapping phase. During our research, we have explored two alternative feedthrough assignment approaches. The first, similar to that of <ref> [16] </ref>, assigns feedthroughs to each interconnect edge based on an edge ordering. In any ordering, edges which receive assignments early in the process obtain high quality assignments, while edges considered later receive lower quality assignments (resulting in significant horizontal jogs). This problem persists under a variety of edge orderings. <p> As high-performance interconnect is not necessarily area minimizing, we are interested in finding interconnect structures for the non-critical nets which are compatible with the fixed high-performance structures. We approach this problem through the application of the iterative deletion method. This method was first introduced in <ref> [16] </ref>, and is a generalization of the solution to the switchable segment problem [37, 35]. 3.5.1. The Switchable Segment Problem The switchable segment problem involves determination of the orientation of edges connecting pairs of pins in the same row (referred to as 2-pin linear nets). <p> The selection of switchable segments can have a major impact on the total density, and thus affect the circuit area. 3.5.2. Iterative Deletion Instead of optimizing only simple 2-pin linear nets, we attempt to find an optimal subset of edges from the "simplified net connection graph," introduced in <ref> [16] </ref>. For each net, the simplified net connection graph is constructed by creating edges between the adjacent pins of a net in each channel. This graph may contain redundant edges, which will be iteratively removed based on their relative costs. <p> An example of such a graph is shown in Figure 5. A simple biconnectivity algorithm can be used to determine which edges are redundant (can be removed), and which are required for connectivity of the net. It was shown in <ref> [16] </ref> that the number of edges in the simplified net connec-tion graph, and the number of edges that must be removed, are linear with the number of pins in the circuit, and that this formulation contains a minimum-density solution. final net topology is a subset of these edges. <p> This process continues until the delay bounds determined for the initial structures are met by the structures after iterative deletion. Therefore, we guarantee that the area optimization performed by iterative deletion will not worsen the circuit performance. 3.5.3. Edge Selection In <ref> [16] </ref>, selection of the maximum cost edge was done by considering the length of an edge, the maximum density of the channel, and the density across the edge. Deletion was done in the most dense regions first, with edge length used to break ties.

We apply the topology algorithms of <ref> [14, 23, 5] </ref> and the wiresizing work of [15, 13] in our global router. * Area optimization takes into account both the timing--critical and non-timing-critical nets, as well as variable width routing and pre-existing congestion. <p> Thus, even if we do not constrain the overall cost, the problem of delay minimization can still be quite difficult. In our global router, we support minimum spanning trees, low area topologies (using the algorithms of <ref> [23] </ref> and [5]), high-performance topologies (using the algorithm from [14]), and also variable-width interconnect sizing (using the optimal wire-sizing algorithms from [13, 15]). <p> We consider the existence of equivalent pins, and take advantage of them to reduce tree length. On random examples, we found that the ERT heuristic produced tree lengths approaching that of the 1-Steiner heuristic <ref> [23] </ref>; the 1-Steiner heuristic obtains improvements of roughly 11% on large problems. Given pin locations from an actual placement, however, improvements were significantly lower. In this table, we consider wirelength of nets with more than two pins; total wirelength improvements are thus even lower. <p> In global routing experiments where we compare minimum spanning tree routing topologies to topologies determined by the ERT heuristic of [5], circuit area results were identical. When we apply the 1-Steiner heuristic of <ref> [23] </ref>, circuit area results are slightly worse, as this heuristic does not take advan tage of equivalent pins to reduce tree lengths or minimize feedthroughs.

Reference-contexts: These methods consider both the traditional concern of low total tree length, and also the path length or Elmore delay between the source node and the timing-critical sink nodes. Many of these algorithms have been surveyed in <ref> [24] </ref> and [12]. In addition to topology optimization, sizing of interconnect wires has also been shown effective for delay reduction [13, 15, 27, 33, 8, 31]. Traditionally, minimum width wires were used for most connections; for high performance sub-micron design, however, this may be inappropriate.

Reference-contexts: This package was previously under development as a university research project [35, 38], and is now supported as a commercial product by TimberWolf Systems. We routed a number of MCNC benchmark circuits <ref> [25] </ref>, with placements for these benchmarks being produced by TimberWolfSC. Note that the placements used by the DECIMATE router were obtained after the TimberWolf global router finished: thus, cell mirroring and swapping performed by the TimberWolf global router was included in the placement used by the DECIMATE router.

Reference-contexts: A hierarchical decomposition of the global routing problem has been used with some success [18, 6], dividing the core area into progressively smaller regions. Simulated annealing has also been applied to the global routing problem <ref> [26] </ref>, where both net topologies and cell positions may be affected. Linear programming methods have been used to select the assignment of segments in [2, 22], in order to minimize the maximum density across a channel.

Reference-contexts: To address these new design parameters, a number of approaches to single net interconnect topology optimization have been proposed, such as bounded-radius bounded-cost trees [10], AHHK trees [1], maximum performance trees [9], A-trees [14], IDW/CFD trees [21], SORT and SERT trees [4], and P-Trees <ref> [28] </ref>. These methods consider both the traditional concern of low total tree length, and also the path length or Elmore delay between the source node and the timing-critical sink nodes. Many of these algorithms have been surveyed in [24] and [12].

Reference-contexts: While the number of structures we consider for each net may be small, and the cost functions are well defined, the problem is still quite difficult. Fact 1 The Interconnect Selection Problem is NP-Hard. Proof: Consider any instance of the well known NP-Hard Knapsack problem <ref> [29] </ref>, and assume that the costs and delays of different interconnect structures in an instance of an Interconnect Selection Problem can be assigned independently.

Reference-contexts: More complex circuit structures may require a more sophisticated approach to interconnect selection; we are currently investigating a variety of methods and delay models. Hill-climbing approaches are an obvious next step, as well as the application of slack-based approaches <ref> [32, 19] </ref>. A number of extensions are also under way, including support for multi-layer global routing, general cell routing, additional topology and wire sizing algorithms, and more accurate delay modeling.

Reference-contexts: We approach this problem through the application of the iterative deletion method. This method was first introduced in [16], and is a generalization of the solution to the switchable segment problem <ref> [37, 35] </ref>. 3.5.1. The Switchable Segment Problem The switchable segment problem involves determination of the orientation of edges connecting pairs of pins in the same row (referred to as 2-pin linear nets). <p> This problem was shown to be NP-hard, and a heuristic no more than 1.5 times optimal was presented in [37]. Many global routing approaches attempt to minimize the total density across all channels by switching segments up and down iteratively. In <ref> [35] </ref>, experiments indicated that 38% of segments were switchable. be routed using one of the two switchable segments. The selection of switchable segments can have a major impact on the total density, and thus affect the circuit area. 3.5.2. <p> EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Results of our global router were compared with those of the well known TimberWolf place and route package. This package was previously under development as a university research project <ref> [35, 38] </ref>, and is now supported as a commercial product by TimberWolf Systems. We routed a number of MCNC benchmark circuits [25], with placements for these benchmarks being produced by TimberWolfSC.
