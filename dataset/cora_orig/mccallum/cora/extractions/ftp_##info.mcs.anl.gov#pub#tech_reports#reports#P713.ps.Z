Reference-contexts: The velocity and scalar fields used in this application were generated by using the PHOENICS CFD package <ref> [1] </ref>. The computational mesh is a static, Cartesian grid containing roughly 150,000 cells, and the query search routine for finding the cell containing a given coordinate is a simple index calculation.

Reference-contexts: Computing and displaying the trajectories of massless particles through a velocity field is a commonly used technique for the visualization of both steady and unsteady fluid flows (for example, see <ref> [2, 9, 12, 14, 15] </ref>). However, massless particle trajectories are not sufficient to accurately represent the particulate motion in the fluid; the particle's mass, velocity, and other physical parameters must be included in the model.

Reference-contexts: The display device used for the applications in this article is the immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago <ref> [3] </ref>. The TrackPack software is linked to the CAVE visualization environment by using the CAVEcomm message-passing library developed at Argonne National Laboratory [7]. <p> We have discussed this work in some detail in [5], and we give only a brief description here. The visualization environment is based on the CAVE technology developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago <ref> [3] </ref>. Users are immersed in the virtual environment by stepping into a ten-foot cube that has stereo images projected onto two walls and the floor. Several users may be immersed simultaneously in the same virtual environment and interact with the same computational model.

Reference-contexts: The evaporation is described by the equation dm p = H v where H v is the heat of vaporization of the particle. 2.2 Numerical Solution A number of numerical integration techniques are available to solve the systems of differential equations given in the preceding subsection (see <ref> [4] </ref> for an overview). <p> For massless particle trajectories in linearized flow fields, these stability requirements are well understood <ref> [4] </ref>, and TrackPack includes a variation of the criteria given in Darmofal and Haimes to ensure both accuracy and stability [4]. <p> For massless particle trajectories in linearized flow fields, these stability requirements are well understood <ref> [4] </ref>, and TrackPack includes a variation of the criteria given in Darmofal and Haimes to ensure both accuracy and stability [4]. The criteria they use bounds local errors arising in massless particle integration through the linearized flow field d~x = d~x and, therefore, can be used to control the global error for trajectories in this flow field.

Reference-contexts: We have discussed this work in some detail in <ref> [5] </ref>, and we give only a brief description here. The visualization environment is based on the CAVE technology developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago [3]. <p> In addition, the ability to connect multiple CAVE environments to the particle tracking software and to each other allows remote collaboration to be possible (see <ref> [5] </ref> for a description of our use of this feature). 5 AN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION The TrackPack software effort was motivated by a joint project between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Nalco Fuel Tech (NFT) to design pollution and slag control systems for commercial boilers and incinerators. <p> Representative sprays for each injector are calculated by using a statistical model consisting of 500 massed, evaporating particles emanating from a singe point in a 30 degree cone <ref> [5] </ref>. The trajectories are displayed by using continuous paths, which can be colored by injector source, by a user-defined scalar quantity such as temperature or particle mass, or by the optimal temperature window scheme.

Reference-contexts: In fact, using the growth error function given above, we found that maintaining small global errors in a massless particle trajectory required excessively small time steps for the forward Euler technique, which led to large round-off error <ref> [6] </ref>. In practice, we have found that for the application problems considered here, only slight differences exist in the trajectories computed by forward Euler and RK4. <p> The solution of Equation 7 depends on the rank of the matrix A. Diachin and Herzog give a complete solution for rank zero matrices through rank three matrices in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Results show that this method is as efficient as the SRK4 method described in [15] but is not restricted to the same stability condition for the time step <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The display device used for the applications in this article is the immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago [3]. The TrackPack software is linked to the CAVE visualization environment by using the CAVEcomm message-passing library developed at Argonne National Laboratory <ref> [7] </ref>. With this software, the engineer can easily define particle characteristics and sources from within the visualization environment and communicate these changes to the simulation process, which could be running remotely on a separate computer. <p> Hence, these components must be able to communicate with each other in an effective, low-cost manner. In addition, this communication layer must be portable so that the numerical calculations in TrackPack can be performed on a variety of architectures. The CAVEcomm library <ref> [7] </ref>, developed at Argonne National Laboratory, provides the performance aspects needed from the software perspective, and we use this as our message-passing interface. The CAVEcomm communication library uses a client-server model in which a broker mediates the communication between TrackPack and one or more CAVE environments.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we normalize the growth factor error by h so that E ( i h)=h &lt; *. The resulting equation for h is nonlinear, and we use the method of false position to find the solution <ref> [8] </ref>. We note that the growth factor error evaluated in this way can be used to bound time steps in linear flow fields or flow fields for which we are using linear interpolation techniques.

Reference-contexts: We are currently working to expand the range of applications that this tool could be used with by developing the software necessary to solve the coupled flow model. Advanced applications are being developed to solve the governing fluid dynamics calculations in parallel using adaptive, unstructured mesh computations <ref> [10] </ref>. We anticipate that the combination of adaptive mesh technologies and parallel computing will allow real-time interaction with more complex models. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the referees for their insightful comments that resulted in significant improvements to this paper.

Reference-contexts: For general use, the user can also choose linear interpolation on tetrahedral cells. If the user data is contained in hexahedral cells, the decomposition to tetrahedral cells is managed by the TrackPack library using the technique described in <ref> [11] </ref>. In line seven, the user sets the solver option to the RK4 integration scheme. As discussed in the preceding section, the user can also choose to use a first-order forward Euler integration routine or the analytic solver for massless particles.

Reference-contexts: However, we recommend that final analysis and design be performed with RK4. 2.3 Analytic Solution Using Linear Tetrahedra In addition to these numerical methods, we also provide an analytic solution technique for massless particle trajectories in linear tetrahedra (see also <ref> [13] </ref>). This algorithm is based on a specialized version of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (SRK4) method described in [15].
