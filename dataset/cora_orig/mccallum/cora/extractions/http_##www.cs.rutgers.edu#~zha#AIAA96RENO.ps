Abstract: The three dimensional crossing shock wave-turbulent boundary layer interaction caused by an asymmetric 7 0 fi 11 0 double fin was calculated by solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a full Reynolds Stress Equation turbulence model. An implicit approximate factorization method is used for the temporal integration. Roe's scheme is used for evaluation of the convective terms of the mean flow and Reynolds stress equations with a third order MUSCL-type differencing. The computed surface pressure is in good agreement with the experiment. The computed heat transfer coefficient shows a modest improvement compared with the previous results obtained using the k * model with Chien's low Reynolds number correction. Both computations of the heat transfer display significant deviations form the experiment. The tests of the grid refinement, different upstream

Reference-contexts: Good understanding and prediction of the shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction will provide important information to aircraft designers. Knight recently reviewed the status of the CFD research on three-dimensional shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction for a family of geometries <ref> [1] </ref>. It is now generally understood that the shock wave structure and pressure field can be accurately predicted in general for simple 3-D shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interactions, e.g., sharp fin and swept compression corner. However, the heat transfer prediction remains a challenge. <p> Collaborative experimental and computational research has elucidated the wave and streamline structure. Good agreement has been observed between computed and ex perimental surface pressure and flowfield profiles; however, computed heat transfer has been found to typically overestimate the experimental data <ref> [1, 10, 17] </ref>. Various modifications to two equation turbulence models have been tested to improve the prediction of heat transfer [16]. There are only a few studies of the asymmetric crossing shock interaction. <p> In energy equation, the triple velocity correla tion 1 2 u j u j u k and the velocity-molecular shear correlation u 00 i t ik are considered small and are ne glected <ref> [1] </ref>. To close the above equations, a turbulence model needs to be introduced to determine the Reynolds stress u 00 00 j and turbulent heat flux c p T u i . A full Reynolds Stress Equation (RSE) turbulence model developed by Knight [21] is employed.

Reference-contexts: Zheltovodov et al [19] obtained surface pressure, heat transfer and flow visualization for several asymmetric crossing shock interactions at Mach 3 and 4. Knight et al <ref> [20] </ref> computed two crossing shock interactions at Mach 4 corresponding to experimental configurations of Garrison and Settles, and Zheltovodov et al, using Chien's k * model. <p> The location 1 is the throat middle line which is along the streamwise direction. Location 2, 3, and 4 are in spanwise direction with the stream-wise position equal to 46 mm, 79 mm and 112 mm. Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 are the pressure distributions compared with the experiment <ref> [20] </ref> and the results using Chien's k * model [20] at those locations. <p> Location 2, 3, and 4 are in spanwise direction with the stream-wise position equal to 46 mm, 79 mm and 112 mm.

In Fig. 3, the computed pressures using both the RSE and k * model along the throat middle line agree well with the experiment except at the very end where there is a strong shock wave reflection from the sidewalls. <p> These results are conjectures and are not verified by the experiment. The total pressure contours looks almost the same as Fig. 7 but with the value decreasing from the entrance to exit <ref> [20] </ref>. Fig. 8 is an enlargement at a streamwise location after the intersection of the shock waves (x=112 mm). <p> Detailed turbulence measurements are not available to assess the accuracy of this prediction. Fig. 9 and 10 are the computed heat transfer coefficient compared with the experiment and the computational results using Chien's k * model. The heat transfer coefficient C h is defined as <ref> [20] </ref>: C h 1 U 1 c p (T w (x; z) T aw (x; z)) where q w (x; z) w @T =@y is the wall heat flux. In the experiment, the C h has a measurement accuracy uncertainty of 10% to 15%.

Reference-contexts: To close the above equations, a turbulence model needs to be introduced to determine the Reynolds stress u 00 00 j and turbulent heat flux c p T u i . A full Reynolds Stress Equation (RSE) turbulence model developed by Knight <ref> [21] </ref> is employed. The model is an extension of an incompressible flow RSE model to its compressible counterparts with some modification regarding the compressibility effects. The model is pre sented below. <p> The turbulent heat flux is modeled using a gra dient diffusion hypothesis c p T u i = c p C h * where C h is a constant. Table 1 presents the values of the closure constants of the present RSE turbulence model <ref> [21] </ref>. <p> However, in the present study, experimental data is available only in the central portion of the flow, and thus our comparison with experiment is expected to be unaffected by the use of slip boundary conditions on the fins. A boundary layer equation code with the same RSE turbulence model <ref> [21] </ref> was used to generate the upstream variable profiles. Since it is generally not possible for the computed upstream profiles to exactly match all the experimental parameters upstream of the intersection, the highest priority was matching the experimental displacement thickness which is considered to have the best measurement accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The correction to the wall functions due to the pressure gradient <ref> [29] </ref> is omitted. The relative contribution of the pressure gradient terms to the Reynolds shear stress at the point of application of the wall functions [29] is proportional to y and thus decreases with decreasing y. <p> The correction to the wall functions due to the pressure gradient <ref> [29] </ref> is omitted. The relative contribution of the pressure gradient terms to the Reynolds shear stress at the point of application of the wall functions [29] is proportional to y and thus decreases with decreasing y. <p> First order accuracy is also used for the LHS implicit operators to save CPU time and to obtain diagonal dominance. 5 At the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, the turbulence variables have discontinuous deriva tives as observed by other researchers [31] <ref> [29] </ref>. The flux limiters, designed to achieve monotone shock wave profiles for the higher order upwind schemes, play a very important role in capturing the turbulent/non-turbulent interface. The 3rd order MUSCL scheme generates oscillations at the interface and drives the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate to be negative.

Reference-contexts: Roe's flux difference splitting scheme is employed for the mean flow and Reynolds stress equation convective terms due to its ability to obtain high resolution shock waves and low nu merical diffusion for viscous flows. The 3rd order MUSCL-type differencing is used for these convective terms <ref> [30] </ref>. However, because central differencing is used for the viscous and turbulence diffusion and the source terms, the general accuracy of the solution is second order. The temporal discretization is first order to save CPU time because only the steady state solutions are of in terest. <p> A smooth lim iter switches the higher order scheme to first order when the turbulent/non-turbulent interface is encountered and can nicely capture the crisp profiles. Two smooth limiters, namely Roe's Super Bee limiter and Minmod Limiter were tested with the MUSCL-type reconstruction [33] <ref> [30] </ref> [34]. The numerical tests indicated that the Minmod limiter was better able to treat the turbulent/non-turbulent interface and therefore is used in the present work.

Reference-contexts: First order accuracy is also used for the LHS implicit operators to save CPU time and to obtain diagonal dominance. 5 At the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, the turbulence variables have discontinuous deriva tives as observed by other researchers <ref> [31] </ref> [29]. The flux limiters, designed to achieve monotone shock wave profiles for the higher order upwind schemes, play a very important role in capturing the turbulent/non-turbulent interface. The 3rd order MUSCL scheme generates oscillations at the interface and drives the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate to be negative.

Reference-contexts: The 3rd order MUSCL scheme generates oscillations at the interface and drives the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate to be negative. The computations have no way to be stable unless smooth limiters are used even though there is no shock wave in the flow fields <ref> [32] </ref>. A smooth lim iter switches the higher order scheme to first order when the turbulent/non-turbulent interface is encountered and can nicely capture the crisp profiles. Two smooth limiters, namely Roe's Super Bee limiter and Minmod Limiter were tested with the MUSCL-type reconstruction [33] [30] [34]. <p> Having benefited from the TVD scheme used in the present computations, the variable profiles captured at the turbulent/non-turbulent interface are as sharp as those resolved by the boundary layer code computation which used a much finer adaptive mesh <ref> [32] </ref>. 5 Results and Discussion To ensure the accuracy of the 3D computer code, several validation computations were performed. Computed supersonic laminar flat plate results have no distinguishable difference from the analytical Blasius solution [35]. This ensures that the code has small numerical dissipation. <p> This ensures that the code has small numerical dissipation. For the supersonic turbulent flat plate flow, excellent agreement was also obtained by comparing the results with those from a separate computation of the compressible boundary layer equations with the same RSE model <ref> [32] </ref>. This ensures that the turbulence model is correctly implemented. The asymmetric double fin channel was calcu lated using the aforementioned algorithm. The two fins have angles of 7 0 and 11 0 , respectively. The Mach number of the upstream flow is 3.95.
