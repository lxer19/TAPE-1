Abstract: Computer technology today only provides modest support for mobile users: small and lightweight `Personal Digital Assistants' are available but are limited to proprietary user interfaces; in particular they lack adequate input facilities. Notebook computers feature standard keyboards but these limit miniaturisation and therefore mobility. Both PDAs and notebook computers suffer from current deficiency of mobile data communication networks which provide, at best, bandwidth of around 800 characters per second. In this paper, we introduce TM, an architecture for Total Mobility, which supports both the mobility of terminals and users. TM consists of two major components:

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, all of these schemes assume the availability of easy to setup connections for the exchange of locks or tokens. This is not the case with many mobile networks; for example, it takes on average 28 seconds to establish a connection on GSM <ref> [AKL+95] </ref>. TM's data management is designed to support disconnected operation for long periods of time and can thus not rely on locking to prevent conflicts.

Instead of associating each mobile entity with a position, we associate each mobile entity with the probability of being in the spatial cell.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 5: Some examples of categories of a lattice-based representation. Instead of associating each mobile entity with a position, we associate each mobile entity with the probability of being in the spatial cell. The mobility of a given entity is obtained from lagged diffusion processes <ref> [Ben79] </ref> on the basis of the continuity, adjacency, and nearest-neighbour relationships between spatial cells. This allows the definition of a filtering mechanism for selecting specific instances of location data from the sensors to be stored within the database.

Reference-contexts: Over the last decade `mobility' has become a key issue for professionals. Nowadays, geographical distances have become totally insignificant. In a recent study, it was found that between 65 to 76% of the entire workforce in Europe spends more than 20% of their time away from the office <ref> [BIS95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although data is already often stored on central servers and accessed by remote sessions via highspeed data networks, this is more difficult where lower capacity data link have to be employed. For example, `teleporting' has recently been proposed and described in detail <ref> [BRH94, RBMH94, Ric95] </ref> as a system for making X-applications mobile across terminals within a highspeed local network by redirecting the X-traffic to the terminal which is closest to the user (see Figure 7 for a simplified overview of the system).

Reference-contexts: TM's file management is described in detail in [HR96, Hil95]. Here, we will give a brief outline of its internal workings. Traditionally, locking has been used to prevent conflicts in disconnected systems. Many derivatives such as voting [Tho78] or token-based schemas such as Burrows' MFS <ref> [Bur88] </ref> are also widely in use. Unfortunately, all of these schemes assume the availability of easy to setup connections for the exchange of locks or tokens. This is not the case with many mobile networks; for example, it takes on average 28 seconds to establish a connection on GSM [AKL+95].

Reference-contexts: These changes have been defined in the Euclidean Space using the binary topological formalism based on the concepts of pointset topology as previously proposed by Egenhofer and Herring [EH91]. The binary topological changes are described as disjoint, meet, overlap, equal, contains, inside, covers, and coveredBy <ref> [CSE94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Can the categories converge? With respect to mobility, computer technology has to deal with three areas: mobility, portability and communication (see Forman and Zahorjan <ref> [FZ94] </ref>). Based on these issues we can identify three distinct categories of mobile computing equipment (see Figure 1): the `stationary' category. This category is populated by large and powerful workstations and personal computers, interconnected to each other via highspeed wired local area networks and the worldspanning Internet.

Reference-contexts: This involves the formalisation of a filtering approach that might avoid redundancy of location data in the database, and it might allow update transactions on the location data of an entity with an optimised rate. 3.1. Sensor System TM uses the Active Badge System 1 <ref> [HH94] </ref> as an example of a sensor system in which infrared base sensors are used to detect the terminal and the person mobility. The Active Badge is an infrared transmitter, sending out pulse-width modulated infrared (IR) signals at regular intervals to a wired network of sensors distributed around a building.

Reference-contexts: Although the sharing of files within TM is, in our experience, a rather rare event, and files will, therefore, predominantly diverse unilaterally, provisions must still be made to handle conflicts. TM's file management is described in detail in <ref> [HR96, Hil95] </ref>. Here, we will give a brief outline of its internal workings. Traditionally, locking has been used to prevent conflicts in disconnected systems. Many derivatives such as voting [Tho78] or token-based schemas such as Burrows' MFS [Bur88] are also widely in use.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, temporal resolution is as fine as the transmitting capacity allowed by the sensor technology. In the case of land-based radio sensors, a mobile user moving at 45 kilometres per hour would have her/his position determined with a spatio-temporal resolution of 430 meters every 35 seconds <ref> [New95] </ref>. The database plays an important role as it integrates sensor observations with different spatial and temporal resolutions from different sensing technologies. Integrating sensor observations will enable query processing about the position of a mobile entity to be carried out independently of how frequently and fast this entity moves.

Reference-contexts: One attempt of addressing these requirements has been carried out in envisaging an architecture for the database using the Active Badge System. An object model based on CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) <ref> [OMG91] </ref> serves as the means for integrating the sensor and the database domains. A variety of object implementations can be supported, including separate servers, libraries, a program per method, and an objectoriented database. This is necessary to allow runtime update transactions as changes occur on location data.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, to optimise the search cost for locating an object, a spatio-temporal indexing is needed in TM. There exist a current trend in spatial data structures of employing recursive hierarchical trees as indexing techniques. Some examples are quadtrees, octrees, and Grid File <ref> [Sam90] </ref>. Such a trend has been influenced by the reliability of the implementation of `search trees' in other types of applications. Temporal databases have also been influenced by search trees as temporal indexing techniques.

Reference-contexts: Technologically little distinguishes the three domains. Improvements in technology have already narrowed the performance and capacity gap and will continue to do so in the future. Especially the development of newer and better PDAs is progressing: laboratories are now working on `wearable' computers <ref> [SS93] </ref>, and there seems no end to the enthusiasm of researchers.

Reference-contexts: Most of the proposed techniques are based on B-trees, which index on timestamp values of a single key; or R-trees, which index on ranges (intervals) of multiple keys. The majority of the indices are tailored to transaction time by associating a timestamp with each object <ref> [TCG+93] </ref>. The indexing technique to be implemented by TM's database is under evaluation. Further research work is required on heuristics for evaluating spatio-temporal indexing techniques which can cope with database search simultaneously with data capture during the run time of a query.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, as outlined in Section 1, the lack of connectivity while on the move has been one of the major obstacles constraining terminal mobility. After a period of considerable growth (for a recent market review see <ref> [TT95] </ref>) a number of mobile communication networks are now available and connections can be established on a variety of cellular voice and data-grade systems with small portable equipment from within large (soon global) coverage areas.

Reference-contexts: Since these restrictions are now becoming apparent, it is time to consider alternative scenarios. In the past, solutions to mobile computing have concentrated on the mobility of computer equipment and have neglected the option of allowing the user himself to move between computers. Wirth <ref> [Wir95] </ref> uses the terms `personal' and `terminal mobility'. With `personal mobility' people are no longer tied to a particular computer but can make use of whatever computer (stationary, portable, or a PDA) is available to them at their current location.
