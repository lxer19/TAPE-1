Abstract: With the proliferation of electronically available information, an additional burden has been placed on the implementors of information gathering (IG) systems. The set of data that represents the best response to a query may be the aggregation of data acquired from distributed, heterogeneous information sources. In such environments, we distinguish between two approaches to the problem of information gathering that may be characterized as distributed processing and distributed problem solving(DPS). The former is characteristic of existing IG systems while the latter is the raison d'^etre for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). We examine features of problems that point to the need for a DPS approach, and discuss the benefits of viewing information gathering as distributed problem solving (which subsumes distributed processing). This approach, called Cooperative Information Gathering (CIG), involves concurrent and asynchronous access and composition of associated information spread across a network of information servers by a group of intelligent agents. Top level queries drive the creation of partially elaborated information gathering plans, resulting in the employment of multiple semi-autonomous, cooperative agents for the purpose of achieving goals and subgoals within those plans. Finally, we briefly survey current work on distributed and agent-based approaches to Information Gathering.

Reference-contexts: That communication step may alter agent behavior, but it does not represent the exploitation of constraints derived from the interdependencies of dynamically generated partial results. A system that uses this approach is the distributed version of INQUERY <ref> [3, 4] </ref> (to be discussed later), where the set of statistics used to compute globally comparable relevance rankings is obtained by pooling statistics from all corpora that will be searched. After that initial computation and communication, retrieval at the various sites proceeds independently and in isolation. <p> However, the kind of domain specificity they exploit in their content-based search algorithms and resource discovery engines is weak domain knowledge like file types, gross syntactic and structural features of documents, or keyword based attribute extraction. IG, however, is potentially very knowledge intensive. Distribution of the INQUERY system <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, on the other hand, is concerned with performance in distributed text corpora. The approach to Distributed IR currently planned for the INQUERY system (as with most other IR systems attacking the problem of distribution) clearly falls under the distributed processing rubric.

Reference-contexts: Also, it may be the case that a solution or partial solution generated by one agent may facilitate (i.e. serve to focus or constrain) the problem solving of another agent and thereby reducing the amount of computation required <ref> [8] </ref>. The problem solving process of one agent in some way assists another agent in its problem solving, perhaps by making the other agent more certain of its local solution or by restricting the space of potential solutions that must be considered. <p> We now discuss implemented aspects of FA/C that have direct relevance to the CIG task.

Reference-contexts: In an IR environment, we want an agent to locate information that is deemed relevant by a user. The notion of relevance is very subjective, leading to research in the area of agents that learn the relevance ranking function of human users. For example, Holte and Drummond <ref> [11] </ref> describe such an agent, called a learning apprentice, that learns from watching a user browse through an electronic library. The actions taken by a user while browsing, carry with them implicit information about goals and justifications for actions taken.

Huhns et. al. <ref> [12] </ref> present a method for learning and updating the relevance of corpora to individual topics of interest via meta-knowledge. Meta-knowledge is kept (learned and updated) by each user on the network and is a 4-tuple of the form [U ser1; U ser2; Keyword; CertaintyF actor].

Reference-contexts: That is, agents can exploit the interdependencies between subproblems to their benefit. This is the essence of the functionally accurate, cooperative (FA/C) paradigm presented by Lesser et. al. <ref> [18, 19] </ref> as an approach to distributed problem solving. In FA/C systems, the interdependencies among subproblems motivate agents to augment their local information with information about global problem solving activity in order to enhance the efficiency of the ongoing problem solving process. <p> These methods have evolved over more than a decade, since the time the FA/C paradigm was first proposed <ref> [18] </ref>. Below, we discuss various techniques and systems from MAS that may have direct bearing on CIG viewed as a DPS task.

Figure 3 (from <ref> [19] </ref>) shows an example of such a goal tree. Solutions to high-level sibling goals like G k1 and G k or more distant goals like G 1;1 and 6 G k;2 can have constraints between them. <p> Each of the agents can model only a part of the global goal structure based on its role in the overall problem solving process. This leads to added complexity in an already complex situation as discussed above. Figure 4 (from <ref> [19] </ref>) illustrates an example where the goal tree from Figure 3 is distributed across two agents. Detection of coordination relationships by the agents now becomes more difficult due to their partial view of the goal tree. replication between two agents.

We will apply the term information server to this combination of an inference engine and a data repository. <p> However, information gathering can exploit more than just relevance knowledge. Besides, when the number of users and the number of topics of interest is large, the propagation of meta-knowledge may easily swamp any given user. 4.2 Intelligent Information Retrieval Ram and Hunter <ref> [23] </ref> take the view that content-based IIR, as opposed to syntax-based IR, requires inference, leading to a combinatorial explosion of potential inferences. Since computational resources are limited, some method of controlling inference must be employed.

Reference-contexts: Further transformations may lead to "Hertz Rentals", "Greyhound" and other transportation companies that are used to retrieve relevant data on the availability of reservations.

Rus and Subramanian <ref> [24] </ref>, discuss the idea of domain-oriented information capture and access using knowledge intensive modules. Given an electronic data environment, the task is to capture the data by acquiring partial models of it and to access the data as guided by the models.

Reference-contexts: The contract net framework can be used to enforce a problem-dependent organization among a set of DPS agents. Along another direction is the work on selfish agents <ref> [25, 33] </ref>. Unlike the agents discussed previously, a selfish agent places self-interest above any "global" requirements and cooperates to the extent of serving its own interests.

Reference-contexts: Information on hand can in turn serve to instantiate and actively direct further retrieval process to resolve the deficiencies in the partial data. Other work in MAS, though not directly falling under the umbrella of FA/C approach, could act as enabling technologies for multi-agent based CIG. The contract net <ref> [26] </ref> is a top-down work allocation scheme among agent sets, where an agent wanting to delegate or contract out a piece of work for some reason announces the work to the agent set.

Reference-contexts: However, note that the delineation between the coordination module and the local processing module may be blurred in many of the existing MAS systems. 4.3 Information Gathering Following the lead of Oren Etzioni's software robots (softbots), Voorhees <ref> [28] </ref> describes an information gathering system composed of corpusbots and userbots. Each corpusbot serves as the system's model of a single collection of documents (corpus). The corpusbot contains all corpus dependent parameters, controls access to the corpus, and provides topic designators that abstract and summarize the corpus.

Reference-contexts: This results in the formation of a search organization for the purpose of satisfying a query. One can easily imagine Telescript servers <ref> [29] </ref> that receive queries and act as regional planning sites, either further decomposing the search into subre-gions or sending agents to local corpora for data retrieval. <p> One exciting aspect of the CIG approach is the availability of technology that facilitates the development of both intelligent agents and supporting structures within the environment, which allow them to interact in exactly the manner that we require. Telescript technology, developed by General Magic, Inc. <ref> [29] </ref>, provides the tools required to build an intelligent agent-based foundation for a global electronic marketplace. Telescript abandons the traditional remote procedure calling (RPC) model of client/server interaction for the remote programming (RP) approach.

Now consider the case where a goal tree is distributed across multiple agents, none of which may have a complete global view of the goal tree.

Reference-contexts: Simply charging ahead blindly, stopping the search when resources have been exhausted is likely to lead to very poor results. Planned activity under time and resource constrained situations is a hard problem needing sophisticated, knowledge-intensive techniques <ref> [1, 10, 31, 32] </ref>. Many questions need to be addressed about the efficient usage of resources.

Reference-contexts: The contract net framework can be used to enforce a problem-dependent organization among a set of DPS agents. Along another direction is the work on selfish agents <ref> [25, 33] </ref>. Unlike the agents discussed previously, a selfish agent places self-interest above any "global" requirements and cooperates to the extent of serving its own interests.
