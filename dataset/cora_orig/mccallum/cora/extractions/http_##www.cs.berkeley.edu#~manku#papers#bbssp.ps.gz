Reference-contexts: Step (D) computes fl, the median of weights of dotted edges and constructs E dl E d , containing all edges weighing less than fl. Median can be computed in O (d) time <ref> [1] </ref>, where jE d j = d. Step (E) computes the mbcc's of L, which can be done in O (d) time, as shown in Section 2.4. Step (F) shrinks L, which again takes O (d) time.

Reference-contexts: Let F T be the family of spanning trees of G. Then, ff = min T 0 2F T max e2T 0 w (e) and 8e 2 T; w (e) ff. T can be computed in O (m) time <ref> [2] </ref>. It is easily seen that w B (G) ff. Step (B) modifies the weights of some edges in E. Any non-tree edge with weight at most ff is increased in weight to ff. All tree-edges are assigned a weight of 1.

Reference-contexts: BBSS finds applications in solving the bottleneck traveling salesman problem [4][8], in communication networks [7] and in approximation algorithms of some `hard' bottleneck problems [5][9]. BBSS with vertices in the Euclidean plane has been studied by Chang, Tang and Lee <ref> [3] </ref>, who propose an O (n 2 ) algorithm. For general graphs, Punnen and Nair [10] present an O (m + n log n) algorithm.
