Abstract: Providing smooth playback capabilities for video servers, which must support potentially thousands of on-demand users, has been an area of active research. From a user's perspective, VCR functions of fast-forward and rewind (FF/Rew), are desirable features in video-on-demand. But FF/Rew at n times the regular playback rate requires n times the regular playback bandwidth from architectural components of the video server. Thus, guaranteeing sufficient bandwidth to enable users to perform FF/Rew reduces the number of supportable users by a factor of n. In this paper we propose an alternative, effective FF/Rew service, which provides FF/Rew capabilities with an associated statistical quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee. This service provides immediate access to full-resolution FF/Rew bandwidth with high probability. When bandwidth is not available, service is either delayed or provided immediately but with a loss in resolution. In addition, we specify several QoS metrics to characterize the delay or loss experienced by a FF/Rew request. We show that using effective FF/Rew with statistical guarantees on these QoS metrics results in a significant increase in the number of supportable users, when compared to systems in which FF/Rew bandwidth is statically reserved for each user. Moreover, a playback-only video server can be extended to provide FF/Rew service by reserving only a small portion of its total bandwidth, which is dynamically shared among FF/Rew requests.

Reference-contexts: This has led to two approaches for allocating I/O, memory system and CPU bandwidth to a stream requiring variable-rate video. In the first approach, a video stream is allocated a fixed bandwidth, often according to its peak bandwidth requirements <ref> [1, 10, 12, 15, 21] </ref>. We refer to this as the peak bandwidth allocation method. The motivation behind this approach is that it leads to simple round-robin or rate-monotonic scheduling in the I/O subsystem or the CPU of the video server.

Reference-contexts: The state variable of each Birth-Death process is the number of users in the FF/Rew queue. Details of the Birth-Death processes for the HD, RD and LS systems are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In that report, we have also derived the QoS performance measures that can be computed analytically. The rest of the metrics are obtained using simulation. 5 Results In this section, we examine and compare the behavior of HD, RD, and LS. <p> The first is N HD (P [W &gt; t] &lt; 0:01) is slightly lower than N HD (E [W ] &lt; t). This also holds for RD. For example, when t = 3, N RD (E [W ] &lt; 3) = 968, whereas N RD (P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> &lt; 0:01) = 953. However, note that if 968 users are admitted following the E [W ] metric under RD, P [W &gt; 3] ' 0:45. P [W &gt; 0] curves under RD and HD when N is in the range [948; 956]. <p> This also holds for RD. For example, when t = 3, N RD (E [W ] &lt; 3) = 968, whereas N RD (P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> &lt; 0:01) = 953. However, note that if 968 users are admitted following the E [W ] metric under RD, P [W &gt; 3] ' 0:45. P [W &gt; 0] curves under RD and HD when N is in the range [948; 956]. <p> This is explained by noting from Figure 4 that E [N F ] is less than the number of FF/Rew servers, and thus there is very little waiting for FF/Rew service in either of the systems. Similarly, there is little difference in the P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> curves under HD and RD in the probability range [0:01; 0:2]. This trend holds for any parameter values where the server is sized for small waiting times. <p> This trend holds for any parameter values where the server is sized for small waiting times. However, as the waiting time and probability thresholds t and Q increase, there is a larger difference between Metrics 4-60 3-20 2-10 N RD (P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> 0:01) 839 953 987 E [W ] slope in overload 1.45 1.24 1.11 Table 1: Comparison between RD systems 4-60, 3-20 and 2-10 N RD (P [W &gt; t] &lt; Q) and N HD (P [W &gt; t] &lt; Q). <p> In Table 1, we give two measures for comparison among the three sets of parameter values. The measures are N RD (P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> 0:01) and the slope of E [W ] (roughly, an overload protection measure) under RD. The trends in both measures are consistent with the fact that 4-60 is more congested than 3-20, which is more congested than 2-10. <p> When users are more tolerant of loss than delay, LS allows the video server to support a higher number of users. For example, for the 3-20 system, N LS (P [L &gt; 0:3] &lt; 0:01) = 963, whereas N RD (P <ref> [W &gt; 3] </ref> &lt; 0:01) = 952. 5.3 Sensitivity Analysis In this section, we examine the sensitivity of the maximum number of supported users under HD, RD and LS, to parameter fluctuations.

Reference-contexts: In a block-by-block frame compression algorithm like MPEG, losing a pixel is equivalent to losing a portion of the frame, and one approach is for the decoder to substitute the corresponding portion of the previous frame <ref> [4] </ref>. Alternatively, the decoder can reconstruct this portion by combining the corresponding portion from the previous frame and interpolations from the adjacent blocks of the current frame [22].

Reference-contexts: Since the number of users simultaneously performing FF/Rew changes in a stepwise fashion over time, a FF/Rew request may experience a series of loss levels. As mentioned in <ref> [9] </ref>, a user often measures the overall quality of a video sequence by its worst resolution. We thus define L max to be the maximum fractional loss experienced by a FF/Rew request.

Reference-contexts: The technique of statistical resource sharing has been used in other areas. Human speech consists of talk spurts and silence periods. In intercontinental telephone circuits, when a speaker pauses, the channel can be reassigned to another user <ref> [13] </ref>. This is done to increase the effective capacity of the circuit. Similarly, processor time-sharing among multiple users takes advantage of the bursty nature of their processing requirements. In packet-based communication, statistical sharing of network resources is a common technique.
