Abstract: Increasing size, complexity, and dynamics of networks require adaptive routing mechanisms. This paper proposes initial concepts towards a learning and generalization mechanism to support adaptive real-time routing. An ASOCS learning model is employed as the basic adaptive router. Generalization of routing is based not only on source/destination address, but also on such factors as packet size, priority, privacy, network congestion, etc. Mechanisms involving continual adaptation based on feedback are presented. Extensions to conventional addressing which can support learning and generalization are proposed.

Reference-contexts: Ad hoc algorithms require unique handling of these different features. A more general learning scheme treats all of these uniformly, with weighting of importance taking place during learning, thus both simplifying and expanding the approach to routing. McDonald <ref> [3] </ref> proposes an Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent System (ASOCS) model as an adaptive network router. ASOCS [4,5,6] are a class of connectionist learning models which seek computational efficiency as highly parallel and adaptive connectionist logic systems that map discrete input values to output values. <p> This paper seeks to extend this approach through more robust generalization techniques. Below, the adaptive mechanism used for learning routing information and doing actual forwarding is simply referred to as the router. The approach proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> assumes a version of the learning bridge algorithm. A router observes the source address and routing features of each incoming packet and remembers on which interface it arrived.
