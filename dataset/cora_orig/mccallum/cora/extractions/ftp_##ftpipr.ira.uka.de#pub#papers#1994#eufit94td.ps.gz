Abstract: In this paper fuzzy-based and neural-based force adaptation approaches for the intelligent control of robotic grip systems are presented. New concepts of nonlinear grasp force control of a three-fingered robot hand are shown: On the one hand two fuzzy controllers, a finger and a grasp controller. On the other hand a neural controller based on a Hooke-Jeeves optimisation approach using a three-layered backpropagation neural network. The development of these controllers is based on the a priori knowledge about the permissible change of the grasp force. A computer based simulation system for the peg-in-hole insertion task performed by a three-fingered robot hand is developed to analyse and to compare the capabilities of both control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Realisation of the neural controller There has been growing interest in using neural networks to perform fast adaptation of the control parameters to the changing environments <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. In this approach we try to optimise the grip stability as mentioned above (3.1). The optimisation is performed by determining holding forces h normal to be superposed to the finger forces in order to maximise the grip stability.

Reference-contexts: The resultant control strategy is that the resultant force in the contact point must lie inside the friction cone and DN has to be as small as possible. The described a-priori knowledge has been transformed into the following fuzzy rule base <ref> [9, 17] </ref>: IF normal_force IS medium THEN DN=Null IF normal_force IS large THEN DN=Null IF tangential_force IS very_small THEN DN=Null IF tangential_force IS small THEN DN=Null IF tangential_force IS medium THEN DN=Null IF tangential_force IS large THEN DN=very_small IF tangential_force IS very_large THEN DN=small IF tangential_force IS extremely_large THEN DN=large IF <p> The simulated results of the fuzzy controller show their performance in handling the uncertainties of the peg-in-hole task performed by a three-fingered robot hand <ref> [9] </ref>. The graphical visualisation is shown in Fig. 4. A comparison of the two designed controllers is shown in Table 1. <p> This comparison demonstrates that the neural network, substituting the algorithm for exact grasp force optimisation, has a greater accuracy than a fuzzy controller <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The optimisation part is the one which is most time expensive and therefore has been transfered to a neural network. The neural network used here is a three-layered backpropagation neural network <ref> [10] </ref> taking the normal and tangential components of each finger force. Therefore, it consists of 6 neurones in the input layer which are only distributing the signals to the hidden layer.

Reference-contexts: This has been performed for several insertion tasks while storing the achieved training data for a later offline training <ref> [11] </ref> of the network (Fig. 5).

Reference-contexts: The grasp-controller takes all the forces in all the contact-points into consideration. Its design is specific to the number of fingers of the gripper - in our case a three-fingered-gripper. For every other multifingered-hand the design has to be changed. For the Karlsruhe-Dextrous-Hand <ref> [14] </ref> the controller has six input values (a normal and tangential-component for each of the three fingers) and one output value DN.

Reference-contexts: cone, is the following: F: = f 0 f x f max , f y + f z m f x - 3 Since there is more than one possibility for compensating finger forces, a criterion for its comparison must be given in order to choose the best among them <ref> [15] </ref>. A finger force should not lie too close to the border of the friction cone where sliding might occur.

Reference-contexts: Manipulation forces, arising from this contact, might cause sliding of the object inside of the gripper. In order to secure a safe and stable grip it is inevitable to control the finger forces in a way that they always compensate the manipulation forces <ref> [16] </ref>. Basically there are two possibilities for solving this problem namely grasp force planning and grasp force control: Grasp force planning is expected to determine an optimal initial force state of the system in order to secure a successful manipulation. <p> This model is called point contact with friction. A grip is called safe when the grasped object does not slide in the gripper; the force of friction, caused by the normal component of each finger force, must exceed the tangential component of the finger force <ref> [16] </ref>. For an easier treatment of this problem it is possible to describe all finger forces in an coordinate system, in which the x-axis is pointing perpendicular to the surface of the object directed towards the interior.
