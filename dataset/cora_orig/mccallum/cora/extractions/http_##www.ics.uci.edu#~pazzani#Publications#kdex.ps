Title: Generating Models of Mental Retardation from Data with Machine Learning  
Author: Subramani Mani Suzanne W. McDermott Michael J. Pazzani 
Abstract: This study focused on generating simple and expressive domain models of Mental Retardation (MR) from data using Knowledge Discovery and Datamining (KDD) methods. 2137 cases (mild or borderline MR) and 2165 controls (randomly selected) from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), a mul-ticentric study involving pregnant mothers and the outcomes, constituted our sample. Twenty attributes (prenatal, perinatal and postnatal), thought to play a role in MR were utilized. The outcome variable (class), was, whether the child was retarded or not, based on the IQ score. Tree learners (C4.5,CART), rule inducers (C4.5Rules,FOCL) and a reference classifier (Naive Bayes) were the machine learning algorithms used for model building. The predictive accuracy ranged from 68.4% (FOCL) to 70.3% (Naive Bayes). CART obtained a sensitivity of 79.0% and also generated highly stable and simple trees across fifty random two-third (training), one-third (testing) partitions of the sample. The algorithms identified emotional/behavioral problem in children as a significant predictor of MR risk. Our study shows that KDD methods hold promise in recovering useful structure from medical data.

Reference-contexts: Mild Mental Retardation (MMR), with an IQ range of 50-69, constitutes eighty percent of all MR and has no known biological cause in more than half of the cases <ref> [1] </ref>, [8]. In contrast, Severe Mental Retardation (SMR), with an IQ &lt; 50, has a known organic basis (e.g. Down's Syndrome, anencephaly, cretinism etc.) in most instances. In this study, we have focussed on learning simple models of MMR, employing KDD methods.

Reference-contexts: When this facility of FOCL is used, it is termed "constrained" FOCL. For this study we used only the "unconstrained" functionality of FOCL. CART <ref> [2] </ref> is a classifier which uses a tree-growing algorithm that minimizes the standard error of the classification accuracy based on a particular tree-growing method applied to a series of training subsam-ples. We used Caruana and Buntine's implementation of CART, (the "IND" package) [3].

For each training set, CART builds a classification tree where the size of the tree is chosen based on cross-validation accuracy on this training set.

To keep the sample representative, only one record per family was selected. We identified 3598 cases who were retarded. We excluded cases with missing values resulting in 2138 cases. An equal number of controls (IQ 85) were also randomly selected for this study.

Reference-contexts: Highly correlated attributes can act as confounders of structural stability. Feature selection could be an option to filter out such attributes. The functional stability of structurally different models could be assessed by the variability in the classification of a representative test sample set apart for this task. Turney <ref> [25] </ref> discusses syntactic and semantic similarity measures (which correspond to structural and functional stability) for characterizing the stability of models. He has argued for semantic similarity measures for ascertaining stability since they are less sensitive to superficial variations in representations. <p> He has argued for semantic similarity measures for ascertaining stability since they are less sensitive to superficial variations in representations. Likewise, they could prove useful in comparisons of stability across much varied representations such as neural networks and decision trees. The reader is referred to <ref> [25] </ref> for a detailed discussion of model stability issues. Adequacy of a model could be extrapolated as a function of its accuracy, comprehensibility and stability. It is mostly domain and user dependent.
