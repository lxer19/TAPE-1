Abstract: The Lorentz lattice gas is studied from the perspective of computational complexity theory. It is shown that using massive parallelism, particle trajectories can be simulated in a time that scales logarithmically in the length of the trajectory. This result characterizes the "logical depth" of the Lorentz lattice gas and allows us to compare it to other models in statistical physics.

Reference-contexts: For the stochastic Lorentz lattice gas each collision is a random event 1 whereas for the deterministic model the effect of the scatterer depends only on the incoming velocity. The behavior of these two classes is quite different <ref> [5] </ref> but the computational approach described below treats both on an equal footing. Computational complexity is the branch of theoretical computer science that seeks to quantify the resources required to solve problems. In this study, we focus on parallel computation and ask the following question.

The size of the problem is defined as the number of bits required for the problem input. <p> The GAP subroutine is the most complex part of solving the Lorentz lattice gas problem so it follows that the Lorentz lattice gas is also in NC. The parallel approach used here is quite similar to that employed for several growth models (e.g. the solid-on-solid model) <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 Discussion We have seen that both the ordinary random walk and the Lorentz lattice gas yield natural decision problems that can be solved in logarithmic parallel time though the approach needed for the Lorentz lattice gas is considerably more sophisticated. <p> Sampling the locations of the walker in this limit is trivial and requires only constant parallel time. The logical depth of the Lorentz lattice gas is roughly comparable to that of a variety of growth models in statistical physics such as the Eden model and invasion percolation <ref> [12] </ref>, all of which are associated with problems in the complexity class NC. These models display less logical depth than diffusion limited aggregation which apparently requires more than polylogarithmic parallel time to simulate [13].
