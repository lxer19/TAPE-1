Title: Propagation of an Electromagnetic Pulse Through a Planar Slab  
Author: Harry E. Moses and Reese T. Prosser 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION. In this paper we derive the solution of Maxwell's equations which describes the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a planar slab of finite width. We consider first the case of a homogeneous slab, where the propagation velocity is constant across the slab, and then the case of an inhomogeneous slab, where the propagation velocity is first piecewise constant, and then continuously varying, across the slab. Our solution is presented in time-dependent form, and includes an incident pulse, of finite extent but arbitrary shape, and the resulting transmitted and reflected pulses. Our results agree with those of Bellman and Kalaba [1] and J. A. Kong [4], which are obtained by a more sophisticated time-independent form. The time-dependent form, however, gives the results directly for incident pulses of arbitrary shape, and shows clearly the effects of the pulse shape and pulse repetition in the slab. Time-dependent methods appear to be having something of a revival lately in the study of both direct and inverse problems involving Maxwell's equations. We hope that this presentation will suggest to the reader something of their simplicity, clarity and flexibility in dealing with problems of this type. 1. SINGLE-LAYER SLAB. We shall assume throughout that the slab lies perpendicular to the z axis in R 3 , with faces at z = a &gt; 0, and z = b &gt; a, and is isotropic in the horizontal x and y directions. We assume that the incident pulse has finite energy, and propagates in the positive z direction, normal to the slab and incident from below. These assumptions make the problem essentially one-dimensional. In this section we review the well-known results for propagation through a homogeneous slab. We assume that the slab is homogeneous in the z-direction as well, and that the propagation velocity is c 0 outside the slab and c 1 inside the slab, where c 0 and c 1 are constants with 0 &lt; c 1 &lt; c 0 (See Figure 1).
