Abstract: Many real world systems and applications require information management components that provide support for managing imprecise data. There have thus been several proposals for extending relational database systems in order to represent as well as query such imprecise data. Little work, however, has been done in modeling uncertainty at the conceptual schema level and in developing design methodologies for developing fuzzy relational databases (FRDBs). To fill this gap, a design methodology for FRDBs is proposed. This methodology contains extensions for representing the imprecision of data in the Entity-Relationship (ER) data model, and a set of steps for the derivation of a FRDB from this extended ER model. As a case study this methodology has been applied to the design of a control database for semiconductor manufacturing. Many real world applications, e.g. genome, geophysical and biological systems, must deal with imprecise or vague data. For such systems, we need information management systems that provide support for managing this imprecise data. Significant work has been done in incorporating uncertainty management in relational databases (RDBs) using fuzzy set theory [BuP82], [PrT84], [RuB92], [Uma82], [ZeK85], but little has been done in modeling fuzziness in conceptual data models. There has also been little progress in developing design methodologies for implementing fuzzy RDBs. In general, a database is designed by first developing a high-level conceptual model, such as an ER model. We support this database design process by extending the representation of imprecision at the conceptual data model level. Next the conceptual model needs to be mapped to an actual implementation, typically using a relational database system. To address this issue, we propose a design methodology for implementing fuzzy relational databases. This methodology, based on the ER design methodology of Teorey et. al. [TYF86], prescribes a sequence of steps to implement a fuzzy relational database from this extended fuzzy ER model. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of our methods by applying our methodology to a system which must cope with imprecise information. This system is a run-to-run (R2R) process control 1 framework developed for supervisory control of VLSI manufacturing processes [CTM93]. At the heart of this framework is a generic cell controller implementation that serves to support the R2R control algorithm [MoM92]. The cell controller, explained in greater detail in Section 5, responds to messages received from external controllers or users by matching these incoming messages to entries in a database. This R2R database contains the information needed to handle the incoming messages. As will be discussed later, a crisp (i.e. a non-fuzzy) data model proves inadequate for providing support for some R2R control tasks. Thus fuzzification can be usefully employed to develop a database that is better suited for R2R control. We identify several aspects of the database that need to be extended to handle imprecision. We then use the proposed fuzzy conceptual design methodology to carry out these fuzzifications to the R2R control database. The resulting fuzzy control database has been successfully integrated into an actual R2R framework.

We adapt the fuzzification operator defined in <ref> [Lee90] </ref> for this purpose. This operator has the effect of transforming crisp data into fuzzy data and is defined by: x = fuzzifier (x o ) where x o is a crisp input value from a process; x is a fuzzy set.
