Abstract: Advancements in storage technology along with the fast deployment of high-speed networks has allowed the storage, transmission and manipulation of multimedia information such as text, graphics, still images, video and audio to be feasible. Our study focused on the performance of the mass storage system for a large-scale video-on-demand server. Different video file stripping schemes, such as application level stripping and device driver level stripping, were examined in order to study scalability and performance issues. To study the impact of different concurrent access patterns on the performance of a server, experimental results were obtained on group access on a single video file and multiple group accesses on multiple video files. All of our experiments were conducted on a fully configured Silicon Graphics Inc. Onyx computer system. The Onyx machine was connected to 31 SCSI-2 channels which have 496 Gigabyte disk storage, 20 MIPS R4400 processors, and 768 MByte main memory. From the experimental results, the storage system of Onyx machine can potentially provide about 360 concurrent video accesses with guaranteed quality of service.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in order to provide a large number of concurrent accesses, the large-scale VOD server should be equipped with a mass storage system with multiple disk systems. Some VOD server design based on the multiple-disk systems have been reported in <ref> [23, 18, 30, 31, 6, 36, 14, 15] </ref> In these studies, multiple disks are usually connected to the same SCSI bus, or 2 SCSI buses in [18]. However, most of the studies are based on analytical models and only verified by simulations. <p> Pre-sorting disk scheduling was used to reduce the disk I/O. However, this server can only supported tens of concurrent accesses and no experimental results were reported in this study. The recent proposed multimedia disk scheduling mechanisms by Chen, Kandlur and Yu in <ref> [6, 36] </ref> assumed that multiple cylinders were retrieved for each continuous media stream, and sequential allocation method was adopted. They also extended their analysis on multiple synchronized disks. The buffering requirement of this scheme was cylinder-based for multi-platter disks, thus requiring large buffer size.

Reference-contexts: Basically, a single RAID 3 would be a severe limitation on the application environments where file transfers on the order of hundred of megabytes or more are becoming commonplace [34]. Given the availability of standard interfaces available on the arrays <ref> [9] </ref> and high-end workstations, a natural extension is to employ multiple RAID 3 devices to achieve the necessary performance and capacity. We shall refer to such a system as array of RAID 3s in this paper. <p> The SGI Onyx computer is connected to a mass storage system consisting of an array of RAID 3s. Each RAID 3 is controlled by Ciprico 6710 <ref> [9] </ref> controller with 8 data + 1 parity Seagate ST12400N 2.1 Gigabyte (formatted) drives [26]. Onyx machines are characterized as shared memory symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures. Up to 36 processors and 8-way interleaving memory could be connected to the 1.2 Gigabytes/sec system bus. <p> the maximum configuration, with four IO4 boards, can deliver up to 640 MBytes/sec disk bandwidth theoretically. 2.2 The Mass Storage System 2.2.1 Hardware Architecture Each 16-bit fast SCSI-2 controller connects to one Ciprico RF6710 RAID 3 which consists of 8 data drives, 1 parity drive, and a disk array controller <ref> [9] </ref> (see Figure 3). The disks used in our RF6710 are the Seagate ST12400N 2.1 GByte disks [26]. A fully configured Onyx machine can support 32 16-bit SCSI-2 channels.

With assistance from Ciprico and SGI we conducted the Maximum Achievable Xfer (MAX) project [24]. <p> The experiments in this subsection study the capability of the disk array regarding to support concurrent accesses with acceptable quality of service. According to the experimental data from Ruwart et al. <ref> [25] </ref>, the throughput of one Ciprico RF 6710 RAID 3 can achieve 17:8 MBytes/sec when the request size is 4096 KBytes. However, it is still not clear what the performance of the disk arrays is when supporting concurrent accesses, which require constant retrieval data rate.

Reference-contexts: Experiments have been performed on this real large-scale server to obtain the experimental results with practical value. Disk arrays have evolved as an effective solution to the I/O bottleneck plaguing many com 2 puter systems today [7, 17]. Arrays of fast, small form-factor, low-power drives <ref> [26] </ref> can provide reliable, cost-effective, high-capacity, high-bandwidth physical I/O devices [16, 19]. Recent studies have focused on the fundamental issues of RAID, including parity placement [17, 29], optimal block sizes [7], and array performance under varying workloads and organizations [7, 8, 22]. <p> The SGI Onyx computer is connected to a mass storage system consisting of an array of RAID 3s. Each RAID 3 is controlled by Ciprico 6710 [9] controller with 8 data + 1 parity Seagate ST12400N 2.1 Gigabyte (formatted) drives <ref> [26] </ref>. Onyx machines are characterized as shared memory symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures. Up to 36 processors and 8-way interleaving memory could be connected to the 1.2 Gigabytes/sec system bus. <p> The disks used in our RF6710 are the Seagate ST12400N 2.1 GByte disks <ref> [26] </ref>. A fully configured Onyx machine can support 32 16-bit SCSI-2 channels. A total of 288 individual disk drives are needed (32 fi 9, 8 data drives and 1 parity drive) to fully populate the 32 disk arrays.

Reference-contexts: The system bus can sustain 1.2 GBytes/sec bandwidth. Up to 32 RISC processors can be connected to the system bus <ref> [27] </ref>. With memory interleaving, the memory subsystem can support low-latency read/write transactions. A brief description of the main components are presented as follows: * System Bus (called POWERpath-2 or E-bus): The E-bus supports up to 32 MIPS R4400 processors, a low-latency memory system, high-speed I/O devices, and high-performance graphics subsystems.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this problem, SGI provides another EFS I/O option, Direct I/O, which allows I/O operations to bypass the RAM buffer cache and gain I/O performance when reading and writing large files <ref> [28] </ref>. One large drawback of the direct I/O is that the data is always written synchronously, i.e., the user process will not return from the read () or write () system calls until the data is transferred. This synchronous behavior will degrade the performance for small I/O request.

However, it is basically still unexplored in the suitability of RAIDs to support the a large-scale VOD server. In this paper, RAID 3 architecture is adopted for the study.

Reference-contexts: Basically, a single RAID 3 would be a severe limitation on the application environments where file transfers on the order of hundred of megabytes or more are becoming commonplace <ref> [34] </ref>. Given the availability of standard interfaces available on the arrays [9] and high-end workstations, a natural extension is to employ multiple RAID 3 devices to achieve the necessary performance and capacity. We shall refer to such a system as array of RAID 3s in this paper.

However, this server can only supported tens of concurrent accesses and no experimental results were reported in this study. The recent proposed multimedia disk scheduling mechanisms by Chen, Kandlur and Yu in <ref> [6, 36] </ref> assumed that multiple cylinders were retrieved for each continuous media stream, and sequential allocation method was adopted. They also extended their analysis on multiple synchronized disks. The buffering requirement of this scheme was cylinder-based for multi-platter disks, thus requiring large buffer size.
