Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We describe an ongoing project to develop an adaptive training system (ATS) that dynamically models a students learning processes and can provide specialized tutoring adapted to a students knowledge state and learning style. The student modeling component of the ATS, ML-Modeler, uses machine learning (ML) techniques to emulate the students novice-to-expert transition. ML-Modeler infers which learning methods the student has used to reach the current knowledge state by comparing the students solution trace to an expert solution and generating plausible hypotheses about what misconceptions and errors the student has made. A case-based approach is used to generate hypotheses through incorrectly applying analogy, overgeneralization, and overspecialization. The student and expert models use a network-based representation that includes abstract concepts and relationships as well as strategies for problem solving. Fuzzy methods are used to represent the uncertainty in the student model. This paper describes the design of the ATS and ML-Modeler, and gives a detailed example of how the system would model and tutor the student in a typical session. The domain we use for this example is high-school level chemistry.

It has been demonstrated that novices focus on the superficial or surface features of a problem, while experts focus on functionality or underlying domain principles <ref> (Chi, Glaser & Rees, 1982) </ref>. In addition, when learning a new task, people often refer back to a previous problem to refresh their memories or to use as an analogy to solve their current problem (Ross, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, this mistake is attributed to a calculation error. Note that since the expert solution was re-solved with the students previous mistake, the error is recognized as not matching [(.045)(.09) 2 ]/(1) 2 = 3.645x10 -4 mol/L not the original expert solution of 4.40x10 -4 mol/L <ref> (see Grer, 1993 for more details of resolving) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The fuzzy methods we propose to use were adapted from the techniques used in Sherlock II <ref> (Katz et al., 1993) </ref>. In Sherlock II, fuzzy probability distributions (fpds) are associated with knowledge variables that correspond to concepts in our network. We also assign fpds to links in the network, and can use the relationships between concepts in the network to help compute the fpds.

Reference-contexts: Conatis work is built on top of the OLAE system <ref> (Martin and VanLehn, 1993) </ref>, which represents a students conceptual understanding of a domain with a Bayesian network of concepts. This probabilistic representation is analogous to our fuzzy representation of the uncertainty attached to each conceptual link in the student model.

Reference-contexts: Related Work To date, cognitive learning theories have mainly focused on computational models of skill acquisition through the process of procedural compilation (Anderson, 1983; Chan, Chee & Lim, 1992; Mbus, Schrder & Thole, 1993) and procedural chunking <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref>. In addition to procedural skill acquisition, deeper cognitive structures are needed that can model abstract principles and concepts, and that can represent relations among these abstract concepts through the use of causal links.

Reference-contexts: In addition, when learning a new task, people often refer back to a previous problem to refresh their memories or to use as an analogy to solve their current problem <ref> (Ross, 1989) </ref>. Pirolli and Recker (1994) showed that good students use self-explanation of example problems using abstract concepts. Elio and Scharf (1990) developed a case-based model that could dynamically represent a novice-to-expert transition, based on a shift from focusing on surface features to abstract principles.

Reference-contexts: These perturbations allow our ATS to model not only the errors and conceptual areas the student is having difficulty with, but also possible incorrect uses of generalization, specialization, and analogy. Representing Uncertainty Fuzzy methods <ref> (Zadeh, 1965) </ref> are used to evaluate the plausible alternatives in ML-Modeler; the most plausible heuristics and concepts (i.e., those that best predict the students behavior) are attributed to the student.
