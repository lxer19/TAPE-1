Reference-contexts: Many possible representations of f exist in this redundant dictionary. Several methods have been suggested to find the "optimal" representation of the form of (1), including method of frames [4], best orthogonal basis [3], matching pursuit [11], and basis pursuit <ref> [2] </ref>. The definition of "optimal" is application dependent. For this work, the application of interest is feature extraction for object recognition [1, 7, 10, 12]. <p> One physically interpretable representation is where each term of (1) corresponds to one of the peaks of the signal. Existing adaptive approximation techniques do not always yield representations with the desired characteristics as summarized in <ref> [2] </ref>. The method of frames and best orthogonal basis tend towards solutions which are not sparsity preserving and are unable to resolve closely spaced features. Matching pursuit (MP) is also unable to resolve closely spaced features. <p> Sections 4 and 5 present numerical examples of the performance of the HRP algorithm. 4 2 Adaptive Approximation of Signals In this section, a brief description of relevant adaptive schemes for signal approximation is presented. In particular, we describe the MP [11] and BP <ref> [2] </ref> algorithms. The following definitions will be used throughout the paper. Let f be a signal in a Hilbert space H. Let fg fl jfl 2 g = D be a set of dictionary vectors with kg fl k = 1 for all g fl 2 D. <p> Figure 4b shows the first ten MP elements. Note that none of these elements correspond to the physical features of the function. 2.2 Basis Pursuit The basis pursuit (BP) principle <ref> [2] </ref> is to find the decomposition given in (1) which minimizes the ` 1 -norm of the coefficients n . The examples presented in [2] indicate that basis pursuit yields decompositions which are sparse and physically meaningful. <p> Note that none of these elements correspond to the physical features of the function. 2.2 Basis Pursuit The basis pursuit (BP) principle <ref> [2] </ref> is to find the decomposition given in (1) which minimizes the ` 1 -norm of the coefficients n . The examples presented in [2] indicate that basis pursuit yields decompositions which are sparse and physically meaningful. Thus, they do not exhibit problems in picking out the two adjacent cubic b-splines in the twin peaks example. An important drawback in the implementation of BP is that of computational complexity. <p> X marks maximum inner product. O marks location of true elements of function. (a) (b) are based on solving a large-scale optimization problem, there exist examples where the decomposition may not be completed in a reasonable amount of time, as stressed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Two algorithms are proposed in [2] to implement the basis pursuit principle : the simplex method and interior point methods. <p> X marks maximum inner product.

This example is similar to an example considered in <ref> [2] </ref>. This signal is the sum of four elements : a Dirac, a sinusoid and two wavelet packet atoms which are closely spaced in time. The dictionary used is a Symmlet wavelet packet dictionary. We will use a time-frequency plane to display the decompositions chosen by each technique.

In particular, we describe the MP <ref> [11] </ref> and BP [2] algorithms. The following definitions will be used throughout the paper. Let f be a signal in a Hilbert space H. Let fg fl jfl 2 g = D be a set of dictionary vectors with kg fl k = 1 for all g fl 2 D. <p> The signal representation is then given by f = i=0 where R n f is the residual in an n-term sum. Often, we choose to approximate f by the n-term sum in (2). 2.1 Matching Pursuit Matching pursuit (MP) is a recursive, adaptive algorithm for signal decomposition <ref> [11] </ref>. The matching pursuit algorithm builds up the signal representation one element at a time, picking the most contributive element at each step. The element chosen at the n-th step is the one which minimizes kR n f k as defined in (2). <p> The MP algorithm yields a cumulative decomposition of f = i=0 The MP approach works well for many types of signals. It has been shown to be especially useful for extracting structure from signals which consist of components with widely varying time-frequency localizations <ref> [11] </ref>. MP is a greedy algorithm in the sense that the element chosen at each step is the one which absorbs the most remaining energy in the signal.

Each of the peaks in the signal are related to physical features of the plane <ref> [13] </ref>.
