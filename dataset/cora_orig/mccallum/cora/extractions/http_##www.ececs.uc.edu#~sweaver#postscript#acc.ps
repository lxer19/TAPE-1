Abstract: Interference in neural networks occurs when learning in one area of the input space causes unlearning in another area. Networks that are less susceptible to interference are called spatially local networks. These networks are often used in neurocontrol, in online applications, where, because of the real time nature of the task, interference is often a problem. Although there are heuristics as to what makes a network local, there is no theoretical framework for measuring localization. This paper provides a formal definition of interference and localization that will allow us to measure a network's local properties. These definitions will be useful in developing learning algorithms that make networks more local. This may lead to faster learning over the entire input domain.

Reference-contexts: When using neural networks, however, learning at x typically does affect the output at x 0 6= x. This allows networks to generalize better but it is also responsible for interference <ref> [1] </ref>. When learning at x causes correct learning at x 0 we say the network is generalizing well, but when learning at x causes incorrect learning a x 0 we say there is interference between training at the two points.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we need a better understanding of what makes local networks local. Although the concept of local networks is found in the literature <ref> [2] </ref>, what is lacking is a rigorous definition of network localization. Generalization, a related concept, is well defined in [3] for example, but the theoretical framework assumes a finite number of input-output pairs. We propose a measure of network localization based on the extent of interference during learning.
