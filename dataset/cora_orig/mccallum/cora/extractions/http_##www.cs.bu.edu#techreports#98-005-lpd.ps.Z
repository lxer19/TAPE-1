Abstract: A number of recent studies have pointed out that TCP's performance over ATM networks tends to suffer, especially under congestion and switch buffer limitations. Switch-level enhancements and link-level flow control have been proposed to improve TCP's performance in ATM networks. Selective Cell Discard (SCD) and Early Packet Discard (EPD) ensure that partial packets are discarded from the network "as early as possible", thus reducing wasted bandwidth. While such techniques improve the achievable throughput, their effectiveness tends to degrade in multi-hop networks. In this paper, we introduce Lazy Packet Discard (LPD), an AAL-level enhancement that improves effective throughput, reduces response time, and minimizes wasted bandwidth for TCP/IP over ATM. In contrast to the SCD and EPD policies, LPD delays as much as possible the removal from the network of cells belonging to a partially communicated packet. LPD preserves network bandwidth by keeping such cells alive and by ensuring that additional cells, obtained through Reed-Solomon block coding at the sender's AAL, are eventually transmitted to salvage the packet in question. We outline the implementation of LPD and show the performance advantage of TCP/LPD, compared to plain TCP and TCP/EPD through analysis and simulations.

Reference-contexts: The output buffer is managed using FIFO scheduling, and cells in input ports are served in a round-robin fashion to ensure fairness. The ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) implements the basic functions found in AAL5, namely fragmentation and reconstruction of IP packets <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. AAL divides IP packets into 48-byte units for transmission as ATM cells, and appends 0 to 47 bytes of padding to the end of data. To support LPD, the destination AAL does not discard cells received even when cell losses are encountered.

Reference-contexts: Four different packet sizes were chosen to reflect the maximum transfer unit (MTU) of popular standards: 576 bytes for IP packets, 1,500 bytes for Ethernet, 4,470 bytes for FDDI link standards [17], and 9,180 bytes which is the recommended packet size for IP over ATM <ref> [3] </ref>. The values chosen for the TCP window size are 8 kB, 32 kB, and 64 kB. Bottleneck ATM switch buffer sizes used are 64, 256, 512, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 cells. Note that the buffer size corresponding to the bandwidth-delay product of the simulated network is 330 cells.

Reference-contexts: The ATM switch architecture we adopted in our simulation engine is a simple, 32-port, output-buffered single-stage switch <ref> [9] </ref>. When the output port is busy, a cell at the input port is queued into the output buffer of the simulated switch. When the output buffer is full, an incoming cell destined to the output port is dropped.

Reference-contexts: Our formulation allows the estimation of wasted bandwidth throughout a multi-hop network, using measurements obtained (say) via simulation of a network with a single, fixed congested switch. The metric to be used in our analysis of the wasted bandwidth in a multi-hop network is the Byte-Hop product (BHops) <ref> [10] </ref>. When data (packet, cell, etc.) of size n bytes travels for h hops, its Byte-Hop product (i.e., the bandwidth consumed by the data), is n fi h.

Reference-contexts: Since TCP/IP relies on the use of temporal redundancy (i.e., retransmissions) to maintain data integrity over unreliable communication channels, our optimistic approach, which relies on message retransmissions for data integrity, could support TCP/IP traffic seamlessly. As pointed out in <ref> [13] </ref>, packet fragmentation can introduce a waste in bandwidth, and it is indeed the main cause of low performance when TCP/IP packets are transmitted through the ATM networks. Fragmentation is inevitable when a packet traverses a network with a smaller MTU.
