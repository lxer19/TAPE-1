Abstract: This paper presents efficient multicasting with reduced contention on irregular networks with switch-based wormhole interconnection and unicast message passing. First, it is proved that for an arbitrary irregular network with a typical deadlock-free, adaptive routing, it may not be possible to create an ordered list of nodes to implement an arbitrary multicast in a contention-free manner with minimal number of communication steps. Next, three different multicast algorithms are proposed with their respective node orderings to reduce contention: switch-based ordering (SO), switch-based hierarchical ordering (SHO), and chain concatenation ordering (CCO). A variation of a binomial tree-based communication pattern with unicast message passing is used on the above ordered lists to implement multicast. The proposed multicast algorithms are compared with each other as well as with the naive random ordering (RO) algorithm for a range of system sizes, switch sizes, message lengths, degrees of connectivity, destination set sizes, and communication start-up times. With larger system size and larger destination set size, the CCO algorithm is shown to be the best to implement multicast with reduced contention and minimum latency. The SHO algorithm emerges as the second best. Such results related to multicast on irregular networks are the first of their kind in the wormhole literature. Thus, these results demonstrate significant potential to be applied to current and future generation NOW systems with irregular interconnection.

This algorithm is very simple to implement and it takes dlog 2 (jDj + 1)e communication start-ups (steps) to complete. Since the destinations and the source are ordered randomly, nothing can be said about contention among messages of the multicast. <p> This is done by doing a switch-based grouping of the processors and then randomly ordering these groups into the list L 0 . Similar to the RO algorithm, the Umesh algorithm <ref> [23] </ref> is now performed on L 0 . Figure 6 (b) shows the multicast tree generated using the SO algorithm for the sample multicast shown in Fig. 5 on an irregular network. It also details the list L 0 for the multicast. <p> The source node s is chosen as the leader node of its subset. A list L 1 is formed by randomly ordering all the leader nodes. The multicast takes place in two stages. The first stage involves performing the Umesh algorithm <ref> [23] </ref> on the elements of the list L 1 . This stage takes dlog 2 jL 1 je start-ups to complete. It is to be noted that there is no contention freedom guaranteed during this stage.

Reference-contexts: Current generation parallel systems like IBM SP2 [33], Intel Paragon [16], Cray T3D [7], Ncube-3 [9], J-Machine [26], and Stanford FLASH [11] use the wormhole-routing switching technique due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead <ref> [25] </ref>. These systems use regular network topologies with various deadlock-free routing schemes. For such regular wormhole networks, many multicast/broadcast algorithms have been proposed in the literature in recent years [2, 4, 6, 8, 17, 18, 21, 23, 29]. <p> As shown in Fig. 1 (a), a port can be connected to the port of another switch, a processor, or kept open. The switch can implement different types of switching techniques: wormhole, virtual cut-through, or ATM. In this paper we restrict ourselves to switches implementing wormhole routing <ref> [25] </ref>. Each port consists of an input and an output flit buffer. These buffers are big enough to capture the header flit of an incoming worm so that the routing decision can be made as soon as the header flit arrives.

Reference-contexts: Switch-based networks are typically built for supporting irregular topology. Such irregularity provides flexibility to design scalable systems with incremental expansion capability. The irregularity also makes the routing on such systems quite complicated. Typically deadlock-free adaptive routing schemes <ref> [30, 31] </ref> are supported on such systems to achieve low-latency and high-bandwidth communication. Such routing flexibility also leads to difficulty in implementing a multicast/broadcast operation in a contention-free manner. Multicast algorithms are typically hierarchical in nature to achieve reduced latency.

We consider some of these issues in the following subsection. 6 2.2 Routing Issues Several deadlock-free routing schemes have been proposed in the literature for irregular networks <ref> [31, 10, 3, 12] </ref>. Without loss of generality, in this paper we assume the routing scheme for our irregular network to be similar to that used in Autonet [10] due to its simplicity and its commercial implementation. Such routing allows deadlock-freedom as well as adaptivity. <p> Our results presented in this paper focus on irregular networks with wormhole routing. We use the software approach with unicast message passing and develop different multicast algorithms while taking network topology and routing into account. In <ref> [31] </ref> Ni et. al. proposed a deadlock-free, adaptive routing scheme for irregular networks with cut-through switches. The routing is based on Eulerian trails. In this paper, we have considered deadlock-free, adaptive routing scheme proposed in [10] due to its simplicity and commercial implementation. <p> The routing is based on Eulerian trails.
