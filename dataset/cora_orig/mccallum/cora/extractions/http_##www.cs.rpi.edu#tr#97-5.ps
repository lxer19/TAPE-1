Reference-contexts: Another application has arisen in the area of computer science concerned with theorem proving by machine, where semi-Thue systems are used and thought about extensively. Typically, these semi-Thue systems, often called "rewrite systems," are used to reduce words to simpler equivalent words (see, e.g., [7] or <ref> [1] </ref>). Rewrite systems and context-free grammars are quite different both in their purpose and their operation. Nevertheless, these enterprises do have in common their use of computationally weak semi-Thue systems.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction, notation and terminology. Semi-Thue systems constitute a universal model of computation, in the sense that any decision problem about computations is reducible to a problem about semi-Thue systems. Every recursively enumerable language is the language of some semi-Thue system. (E.g., see Chapter 7 of <ref> [3] </ref>.) And yet the concept is simple: A semi-Thue system is an ordered pair (; ), where is a finite alphabet of characters and a finite set of rules (u; v), where in each case u and v are words over .

Reference-contexts: At any rate, several research workers have decided to focus on the uniform halting problem; in particular, the question of whether or not that problem is decidable for the subclass of one-rule semi-Thue systems has received some attention, so far without an answer, in <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14] and [16].

Reference-contexts: And more useful, albeit in a restricted set of possible applications, because the ability to tell whether or not derivations will 2 terminate gives the user an advantage. The importance of termination in the practical use of rewrite systems is described in detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. The uniform halting problem seems more difficult than the other two, although there seems to be no general proof that if that problem is solvable for any subclass of semi-Thue systems then the other two problems are solvable also.

This subclass will be discussed in Section 4. <p> Derivations in semi-Thue systems with an inhibitor will be analyzed in detail in Section 2. The subclass of semi-Thue systems with an inhibitor was noticed in the course of studying the subclass of one-rule systems <ref> [13] </ref>. The results of the present paper on semi-Thue systems with an inhibitor lead to a distinction that promises to be fruitful in analyzing derivations in one-rule systems without an inhibitor. That distinction, between well behaved derivations and ill behaved derivations, is explained in Section 4. <p> L for the language S L by repeating the following step as often as possible: for a pair of nodes N; N 0 and an integer i; 1 i k, 1 I am grateful to Friedrich Otto for pointing out a defect in a previous version of this algorithm in <ref> [13] </ref>. if there is a walk from N to N 0 spelling out u i , insert a lambda arc from N to N Li , provided that there is not one already there. <p> Example 1. The inhibition system T 0 of the system T whose one rule is (cb; bbcc) has five rules: (cb; bbcc) 2 This section is based on material from <ref> [13] </ref>. 21 (cb; bbcc) (cb; bbcc) (cb; bbcc) (cb; bbcc) This system T 0 has an infinite derivation. In fact, all we need for this infinite derivation is the one rule (cb; bbcc). <p> By (a) we then see that s 4 cannot exist, which completes our proof that the system with the one rule (ccb; bbccc) has no infinite well behaved derivation, ending our discussion of Example 2. In <ref> [13] </ref> there is a much more expeditious algorithm for the problem of whether a given one-rule semi-Thue system has an infinite well behaved derivation. <p> That algorithm does not require consideration of the inhibition system of the given system, but involves a structural analysis of one-rule systems that is well outside the purview of this paper. That structural analysis having been established, the proof in <ref> [13] </ref> that the one-rule system (ccb; bbccc) has no infinite well behaved derivation takes one quarter the space used in the proof given above as part of Example 2. This example generalizes. <p> In <ref> [13] </ref> it is proved that such a system in which either p &lt; 2n or q &lt; 2m has no infinite well behaved derivation. <p> derivation at all in any of the following cases: (1) p n, (2) q m, (3) p &lt; 2n and q is not a multiple of m, (4) q &lt; 2m and p is not a multiple of n. (Senizergues [14] has extended these results of Zantema and Geser.) In <ref> [13] </ref> it is proved that if p 2n and q 2m then there is an infinite well behaved derivation. The two examples discussed in this section illustrate the distinction between well behaved infinite derivations and ill behaved infinite derivations. <p> It seems to me that further progress on this question will come only if research workers achieve a structural understanding of ill behaved derivations. There are partial results towards this end in <ref> [13] </ref>. The halting problem is open for one-rule semi-Thue systems. On the other hand, we have Theorem 4.3. The derivability problem is decidable for one-rule semi-Thue systems.

Reference-contexts: These systems are called "semi-Thue systems" because the rules are not necessarily reversible, u being referred to as "the left side" and v "the right side" of the rule (u; v). Semi-Thue systems are distinguished from Thue systems (named for their originator Axel Thue <ref> [15] </ref>) whose rules operate in both directions. The important notion in the study of semi-Thue system is that of a derivation from one string to another.
