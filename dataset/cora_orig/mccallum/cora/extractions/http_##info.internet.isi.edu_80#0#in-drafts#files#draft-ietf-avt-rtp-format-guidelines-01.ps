Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. Abstract This document provides general guidelines aimed at assisting the authors of RTP Payload Format specifications in deciding on good formats. These guidelines attempt to capture some of the experience gained with RTP as it evolved during its development.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This document provides general guidelines aimed at assisting the authors of RTP <ref> [1] </ref> Payload Format specifications in deciding on good formats. These guidelines attempt to capture some of the experience gained with RTP as it evolved during its development. 2 Background RTP was designed around the concept of Application Level Framing (ALF), first described by Clark and Tennenhouse [2].

Reference-contexts: These guidelines attempt to capture some of the experience gained with RTP as it evolved during its development. 2 Background RTP was designed around the concept of Application Level Framing (ALF), first described by Clark and Tennenhouse <ref> [2] </ref>. The key argument underlying ALF is that there are many different ways an application might be able to cope with misordered or lost packets.

Reference-contexts: Instead it must define its own fragmentation mechanism. Such mechanisms may involve codec-specific information that allows decoding of fragments. Alternatively they might allow codec-independent packet-level forward error correction <ref> [3] </ref> to be applied that cannot be used with IP-level fragmentation. In the abstract, a codec frame (i.e., the ADU or the minimum size unit that has semantic meaning when handed to the codec) can be of arbitrary size. For PCM audio, it is one byte.
