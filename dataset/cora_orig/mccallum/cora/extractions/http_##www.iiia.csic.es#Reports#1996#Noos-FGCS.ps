Reference-contexts: An example of using NOOS is also presented, but the reader may be interested in other more detailed applications of NOOS for case-based reasoning (CBR) systems <ref> [2] </ref>, integrating induction and CBR [6], and the support NOOS gives for knowledge modelling [3]. 1 2 The NOOS approach generate-and-test generate test 2.1 The NOOS Model 2.2 The NOOS Language domain knowledge concepts relations "owner of a car" problem solving knowledge tasks methods methods metalevel knowledge about metalevel concepts metalevel <p> A metalevel method computes a set of ordered methods for that metalevel feature. This metalevel method can take into account the information given in the current problem. We have shown elsewhere that case-based reasoning methods <ref> [2] </ref> and inheritance [14] can be defined as metalevel methods in NOOS. <p> This method can examine the previous car problems and retrieve those that have in common with current problem at least the same complaint. Then, it selects the explanation methods that were successfully used in the task of those cases as the best possible explanations for the current diagnosis problem <ref> [2] </ref>. Since metalevels and methods are also defined by means of entity descriptions, this uniformity has two main consequences for the expressive power of NOOS. First, since a metalevel is also an entity, a metalevel can also have its own metalevel. Thus, virtually infinite towers of metalevels are allowed.
