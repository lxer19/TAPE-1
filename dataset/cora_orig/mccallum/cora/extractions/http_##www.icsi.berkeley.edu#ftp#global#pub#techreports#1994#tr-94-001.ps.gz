Abstract: Most connectionist research has focused on learning mappings from one space to another (eg. classification and regression). This paper introduces the more general task of learning constraint surfaces. It describes a simple but powerful architecture for learning and manipulating nonlinear surfaces from data. We demonstrate the technique on low dimensional synthetic surfaces and compare it to nearest neighbor approaches. We then show its utility in learning the space of lip images in a system for improving speech recognition by lip reading. This learned surface is used to improve the visual tracking performance during recognition.

Reference-contexts: Our training set consists of 4500 images of a speaker uttering random words 1 . The training images are initially "labeled" with the conventional snake algorithm. 1 The data was collected for an earlier lipreading system described in <ref> (Bregler, Hild, Manke, Waibel 1993) </ref> relaxation c) The final contour. Incorrectly aligned snakes are removed from the database by hand. The contour shape is parameterized by the x and y coordinates of 40 evenly spaced points along the snake. All values are normalized to give a lip width of 1.

Reference-contexts: The full lipreading system which combines the described tracking algorithm and a hybrid connectionist speech recognizer (MLP/HMM) is described in <ref> (Bregler and Konig 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It should be able to identify the corners of the lips and to estimate the bounding curves robustly under a variety of imaging and lighting conditions. Two approaches to this kind of tracking task are "snakes" <ref> (Kass, et. al, 1987) </ref> and "deformable templates" (Yuille, 1991). Both of these approaches minimize an "energy function" which is a sum of an internal model energy and an energy measuring the match to external image features.

Reference-contexts: The principle values can be used to determine the most likely dimension of the surface and that number of the largest principle components span its tangent space <ref> (Omohundro, 1988) </ref>. The key idea behind our representations is to "glue" these local patches together using a partition of unity. We are exploring several implementations, but all the results reported here come from a represenation based on the "nearest point" query.

Reference-contexts: We have described an algorithm which is capable of efficiently performing these tasks and demonstrated it on both synthetic data and on a real-world lip-tracking problem. The approach can be made computationally efficient using the "bumptree" data structure described in <ref> (Omohundro, 1991) </ref>. We are currently studying the use of "model merging" to improve the representation and are also applying it to robot control.
