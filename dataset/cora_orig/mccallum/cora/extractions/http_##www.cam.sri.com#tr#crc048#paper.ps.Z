Abstract: This paper describes a reversible system for the interpretation and generation of sentences containing context dependent constructs like pronouns, focus, and ellipsis. A variant of `quasi-logical form' is used as an underspeci-fied meaning representation, related to `resolved logical forms' via `conditional equivalences'. These equivalences define the semantics of contextually dependent constructs with respect to a given context. Higher order unification and abduction are used in relating expressions to contexts.
