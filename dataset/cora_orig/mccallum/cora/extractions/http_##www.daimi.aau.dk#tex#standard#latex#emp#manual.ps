Abstract: The EMP package allows to encapsulate METAPOST files in L A T E X sources. This is very useful for keeping illustrations in sync with the text. It also frees the user from inventing descriptive names for PostScript files that fit into the confines of file system conventions. EMP is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any later version. EMP is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

Reference-contexts: It is much easier to remember to update an illustration if one doesn't have to switch files in the editor. 2. One does not have to invent illustrative file names, if the computer keeps track of them. Therefore EMP was written to allow to encapsulate METAPOST <ref> [1, 2] </ref> into L A T E X [2, 3, 4]. These macros have some overlap with feynMF [2, 5], axodraw [6] and mfpic [2, 7]. In fact, most of the functionality of EMP is available from feynMF.
