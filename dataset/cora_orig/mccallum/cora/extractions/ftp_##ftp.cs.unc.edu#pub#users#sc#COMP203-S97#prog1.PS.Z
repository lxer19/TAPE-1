Abstract: The input is an n fi n greyscale image represented as an integer array P . Do not assume that n is a power of two. The desired output is an n fi n array R of integers that form a valid labeling of the regions of the input greyscale image. We now define the term region label. Two pixels p and q are connected if and only if there exists a sequence x = hx 1 = p; : : : ; x k = qi of k &gt; 2 distinct pixels such that pixels x i and x i+1 are adjacent for all 1 6 i &lt; k. A set of pixels is connected if and only if every pair of pixels in the set is connected. A region is a maximal connected set of pixels. A region label is a function L from pixels to integers such that two pixels map to the same integer if and only if they belong to the same region. In principle, the integers used to label regions could be arbitrary. However, to simplify program testing and grading, we will require that the region label L(p) of every pixel p in region S be maxfr +nc j (r; c) 2 Sg. We represent the region label as the n fi n array R, such that R[r][c] = L((r; c)) for 0 6 r; c; &lt; n. 1. Random mate: This is the algorithm we are covering in class. It is described in x3.5 of the lecture notes. 4. Roll your own: You could invent your own algorithm for this problem. Just be sure to prove its correctness! Who knows? You could come up with the latest and greatest algorithm for this problem, which would result (at least) in a conference publication.
