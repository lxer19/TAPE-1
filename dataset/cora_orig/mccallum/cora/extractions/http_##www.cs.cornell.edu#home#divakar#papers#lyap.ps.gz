Abstract: Lyapunov exponents are frequently used to characterize chaotic dynamical systems, but most computations are not very accurate. Using a 4th order discretization, a moderately small time step (h = 1=128), and a long integration (till t = 10 7 ), we show that the Lyapunov exponents of the Lorenz equations with = 16:0, = 45:92 and fi = 4:0 are We give the Lyapunov exponents with equal accuracy for other standard choices of the parameters. These computations with the Lorenz equations illustrate the requirements for an accurate determination of the Lyapunov exponents | long integration, higher order discretiza-tion, and a short time step. Even though accurate determination of Lyapunov exponents is usually impractical for high dimensional dynamical systems, we show using examples that ignoring these require ments can lead to an erroneous inference of chaos.

Reference-contexts: Lyapunov exponents are often used to provide numerical evidence of chaos; some examples are [16] [31] [32] [34] [42] [45]. There has also been an effort to define and work with finite-time, local Lyapunov exponents [1] <ref> [2] </ref> [3].

The second choice with the same and fi but = 40 is less common [9] [10] [18]. <p> log (2) is given as 2:16 in [44] though the correct rounded value to two digits is 2:17, and as 2:164 in [36] though the correct rounded value to three digits is 2:168; 1 is given as 1:48804 in [10] which is off by about :01, and as 1:51 in <ref> [2] </ref> which is also off by about :01. The only one of these papers to give an estimate of the error is [2], where it is correctly implied that the value 1:51 can be off by about :01. <p> [36] though the correct rounded value to three digits is 2:168; 1 is given as 1:48804 in [10] which is off by about :01, and as 1:51 in <ref> [2] </ref> which is also off by about :01. The only one of these papers to give an estimate of the error is [2], where it is correctly implied that the value 1:51 can be off by about :01. We note that the error in 1 as reported in Table 1 is only :00008. <p> Besides the rate of convergence of (1.1) 4 as t ! 1 is very slow; it is about t 1=2 for the Lorenz equations as we show in Section 3 or as reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, unsurprisingly, the errors in most published calculations of the Lyapunov exponents are mainly due to the finite length of integration. The length of integration we use for the Lorenz equations, T = 10 7 , is far longer than it was in any previous calculation. <p> The slow convergence as t ! 1 is because of variation in the local rate of divergence of trajectories on the surface of the attractor. The variation of the local rates of divergence on the surface of a strange attractor is studied with several examples by Abarbanel, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Eckmann and Ruelle [14] note that the number of points needed for filling up a d dimensional volume is exponential in d, and argue that the length of the experimental time series needed to correctly infer the dimension of the attractor and the Lyapunov exponents increases exponentially with d.

Reference-contexts: If the initial condition M (0) is taken as the d fi d identity matrix, M (t) will be equal to @y (t) @y 0 . This approach is clearly explained in [13]. We used automatic differentiation [22] <ref> [5] </ref> of the numerical ODE solver that approximately computed y (t) from y 0 5 to approximate @y (t) @y 0 and thus avoided the extra set of matrix differential equations. <p> However, similar questions about products of independent random matrices have satisfactory answers [6] [28]. with respect to y (0) as t ! 1. The higher derivatives were computed using the automatic differentiation package ADOL-C <ref> [5] </ref>. The exponential increase shown in Figure 2 is not surprising. Since the trajectory y (t) itself is exponentially sensitive to small changes in y (0), all derivatives of y (t) with respect to y (0) also have to be exponentially sensitive to changes in y (0).

Reference-contexts: There is no explanation why this is so, in part because there is no perturbation theory for Lyapunov exponents. However, similar questions about products of independent random matrices have satisfactory answers <ref> [6] </ref> [28]. with respect to y (0) as t ! 1. The higher derivatives were computed using the automatic differentiation package ADOL-C [5]. The exponential increase shown in Figure 2 is not surprising.

Reference-contexts: The Lyapunov exponents, 1 2 d , are defined by i = lim 1 log i @y 0 ; (1.1) where i is the ith singular value with 1 being the 2-norm [35] <ref> [7] </ref>. Obviously, 1 &gt; 0 implies sensitive dependence on the initial condition. The right singular vectors of @y (t) @y 0 also converge as t ! 1, and the directions corresponding to positive Lyapunov exponents are called the stretching directions at y 0 . <p> For a description of singular values and vectors, see [43]. Basic questions about the existence of the Lyapunov exponents i and their independence from the initial condition y 0 for a given strange attractor are not answered convincingly by existing theory. Osseledac's theorem [35] <ref> [7] </ref> guarantees both existence and independence from the initial condition with respect to an ergodic, invariant measure.

Reference-contexts: Since Nakagawa and Kuramoto are mainly interested in the limit with infinite oscillators, our observations above may not contradict their conclusions about stretching and folding chaos in coupled Ginsburg-Landau oscillators. Some examples of long transients are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. Manneville [30] refers to long, seemingly chaotic transients in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with periodic boundary conditions. The Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation is often used as a model partial differential equation which can become turbulent.

[17] conclude that these algorithms are problematic. Their conclusions were borne out by our numerical experiments even though we implemented the suggestions in <ref> [10] </ref>. Therefore, we will not consider these continuous algorithms at all. It is well known that it is impossible to approximate trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems accurately as t ! 1 [41]. Since the top Lyapunov exponent is positive, even the inevitable local discretization errors are amplified exponentially in time.

Methods for computing Lyapunov exponents, which are all based on (1.1), are compared and contrasted in [17]. <p> [43], relies on the fact that if 0 = t 0 t 1 t k then @y (t k ) @y (0) equals the product @y (t k ) @y (t 1 ) There are algorithms for computing Lyapunov exponents that perform QR-factorization or the SVD continuously in time [18] <ref> [21] </ref>. But Geist et al. [17] conclude that these algorithms are problematic. Their conclusions were borne out by our numerical experiments even though we implemented the suggestions in [10]. Therefore, we will not consider these continuous algorithms at all.

Reference-contexts: For 1 , we used the accurate but inexact value in Table 1 for computing errors. Figure 3 used the standard 4th order Runge-Kutta method <ref> [26, p. 138] </ref>. From Figure 3, it is clear that the convergence to 1 as t ! 1 is not very clean. <p> But when the time step is not too small the total error in approximating the Lyapunov exponents will be dominated by the discretization error. The 2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods used for the experiments in Figure 4 are described in <ref> [26, p. 135, p. 138] </ref>. The errors in 2 quickly go down to about 10 4 , which is the minimum error possible since all integrations are stopped at t = 10000. <p> The Fehlberg 7th order Runge-Kutta method used is described in <ref> [26, p. 180] </ref>. We believe that the estimate of 1 in the first row, and may be even the estimate in the second row, are corrupted by discretization errors.

Reference-contexts: There is no explanation why this is so, in part because there is no perturbation theory for Lyapunov exponents. However, similar questions about products of independent random matrices have satisfactory answers [6] <ref> [28] </ref>. with respect to y (0) as t ! 1. The higher derivatives were computed using the automatic differentiation package ADOL-C [5]. The exponential increase shown in Figure 2 is not surprising. <p> This argument cannot be made rigorous because examples with discontinuous dependence of the Lyapunov exponents on the parameters are known [13]. However, it is unclear if these examples are typical. In the related theory of random matrix products, Le Page <ref> [28] </ref> has proven continuous dependence of the Lyapunov exponents on the distribution of the matrices. 4 The Lorenz Equations Since 2 = 0 and 1 + 2 + 3 = fi 1 for the Lorenz equations, determining 1 accurately leads to an accurate value for both 2 and 3 .

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the discretization errors in solving dy (t) dt = f (y) become as significant as errors due to the finite length of integration in computing Lyapunov exponents. Every numerical method approximates @y (t) dt = f (y) by a discrete dynamical system that is locally close to it <ref> [41] </ref>. The discretization error, which is the difference between the Lyapunov exponents of the continuous dynamical system and its discrete approximation, depends on the time step h of the numerical method. <p> Their conclusions were borne out by our numerical experiments even though we implemented the suggestions in [10]. Therefore, we will not consider these continuous algorithms at all. It is well known that it is impossible to approximate trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems accurately as t ! 1 <ref> [41] </ref>. Since the top Lyapunov exponent is positive, even the inevitable local discretization errors are amplified exponentially in time. However, the numerical attractor usually approximates the actual strange attractor quite well [41]. The situation for @y (t) @y 0 is similar. <p> is well known that it is impossible to approximate trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems accurately as t ! 1 <ref> [41] </ref>.

For example, the numerical evidence for chaos in the solar system given by Sussman and Wisdom <ref> [42] </ref>, uses an integration length of only 100 million years, which is just 5 to 20 times the 1= 1 for the solar system. <p> But since IEEE double precision arithmetic allows for 16 digits of precision and it is typically hard to get even 3 or 4 digits of the Lyapunov exponents accurately, rounding errors are completely harmless. In their computations with the solar system, Sussman and Wisdom <ref> [42] </ref> implemented quadruple precision arithmetic only to realize that it was unnecessary. It is clear from the experiments in Figures 3 and 4 that computing the Lyapunov exponents accurately for the Lorenz equations requires a long integration, a higher order discretization and a short time step.
