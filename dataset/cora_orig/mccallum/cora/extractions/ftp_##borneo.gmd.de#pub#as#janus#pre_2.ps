Abstract: In the evolution of the mammalian brain the two-sided nature of the neural motor control and sensory input has been preserved in the architecture of the cerebral matter. We believe this fundamental two-sided nature of the mammalian brain to hold a very important clue to the problem-solving capability and method of the higher mammals. The janus idea for the design of a robot's brain is to have a two-hemisphere architecture on the macro-level and self-assessing modules of neural networks on the micro-level. At the highest architectural level there is the possibility of conflicts between the opinions of the two hemispheres, which can independently process the same data and generate motor decisions. The halves are connected by a simplified analogue of the Corpus Cal-losum, through which they can exchange information at various architectural levels. In this paper the janus architecture is motivated and described, and we explain how we expect to use this medically-inspired model to contribute to our understanding of neurophysiological rehabilitation, through construction of a visuo-manual prototype, which has two eyes and two arms.

However, the similarities end at that level and a great deal of freedom is permitted in lower-level neural network module development, within the framework of the essential constraints. <p> We hope to include such differences in our model eventually in a general way through imposing greater self-supervision of the processing occurring on the left side <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.2 Cerebellum processing In both sides of the cerebellum we find the basic control modules, such as those controlling limb movement and coordination. The cerebellum of our prototype is concerned with arm movement specifically.

Note that the authority inherits a confidence from the minoss it is comprised of. In a sense, our modules are like holons in the sense used by Koestler <ref> [3] </ref>, in that they too are small janus's that form part of the whole, but function independently. The same applies for higher levels in the module hierarchy. For more details see [7]. 5 The Dual Arm, Dual Eye prototype system Our prototype system has two arms and two eyes.

Reference-contexts: The degree of unconscious/passive learning depends on the persistence of the exercise. In the prototype they allow for the possiblility of passive learning of one-side control of the robot through experiencing other-side control, which is important for some rehabilitation programs <ref> [6] </ref>. Attentional processes that constantly monitor the sensory inputs in order to discover interesting changes in the environment or avoid unpleasant ones, are also located here. For the prototype they are necessary for changing the concentration area of the eyes during a scanning exercise and pulling new objects into focus. <p> Having succeeding in this respect, we have in our possession a skillful neural network based modular robot, with a two-hemisphere adaptable brain. This we will then use 8 to investigate various aspects of brain research. Our first example is that of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation studies <ref> [6] </ref> have shown how, after damage of the cortex on one side of the brain makes conscious limb movement for the affected side impossible, although the motor cortex is undamaged, it is possible slowly to relearn the control movements for this side through running the limbs controlled by the other side

Reference-contexts: In janus the system uses actively the interaction between more analytical problem solving and more synthetical problem solving. The system tries to improve continuously using its "reflective" architecture. The janus implementation and simulation is made possible by a very powerful tool: the object-oriented modular simulator SESAMe <ref> [11] </ref>. Our initial experiments with such systems of neural modules have been very promising.
