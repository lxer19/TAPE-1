Abstract: At several meetings, J. Hartmanis asked: If it turns out that NP-hard problems are not solvable in polynomial time, will it mean that there is a "hard" sparse sequence of instances, i.e., a sequence which is hard for every polynomial-time algorithm? A natural next question is: how frequent are such "hard" sequences? If we pick a sequence "at random", what is the chance that this randomly chosen sequence is hard? In principle, it could happen that almost all sequences are hard; it could happen that almost all sequences are easy; in principle, it may seem that a third alternative is also possible: that, say, half of all sequences (or any other portion different from 0 and 1) are hard, and the rest are easy. In this paper, we show that this third alternative is impossible. To be more precise, we show that for each decision problem, either almost all sequences of instances are easy, or almost all sequences of instances are hard. Let A P be the collection of polynomial time-bounded algorithms A such that, for every binary string x we have:
