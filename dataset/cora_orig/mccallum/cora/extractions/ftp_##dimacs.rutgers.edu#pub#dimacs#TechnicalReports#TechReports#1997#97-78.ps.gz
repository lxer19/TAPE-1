Reference-contexts: with Q (x; y); R 0 i (x; y) 2 S, such that R 0 i (x; y) is obtained from Q (x; y) by applying one of the equalities in (in either direction)? This problem arises in connection with checking the equivalence of piecewise-linear (PL) sets; for example, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Let us use the notation P (x; y) = Q (x; y) to denote two polynomials equivalent in the above sense. Let 6= denote the negation of the relation = . <p> A consequence of = being an equivalence relation is: Observation 1.1 Let P = P 0 . Then, P = Q if and only if P 0 = Q. It was shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that the decision procedure is decidable. However, no efficient algorithm was known for this procedure (or, a proof that the problem is intrinsically hard, i.e. NP-hard). The purpose of this paper is to give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if P (x; y) = Q (x; y). <p> More precisely, one can show the following proposition, whose proof is implicit in <ref> [1] </ref>. Proposition 2.1 Assume P = Q. Then, there is a sequence of transformation of P to Q such that every polynomial in the sequence (except the first one, i.e.
