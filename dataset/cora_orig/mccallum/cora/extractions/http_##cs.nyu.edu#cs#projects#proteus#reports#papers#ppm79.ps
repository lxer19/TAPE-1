Reference-contexts: Our alignment program employs dynamic programming algorithms <ref> (see for example Cormen et al. 1990, pp.299-328) </ref>, which are described in later sections. Given N nodes in the source forest and M nodes in the target forest, an N fi M matrix is created to store all matches between nodes.

Reference-contexts: Each subsequent time when the score is required, it is looked up in the matrix. We have implemented this approach for a small set of corpora from two sources: 73 Spanish sentences from three chapters of a Spanish text book <ref> (Jarrett and McManus 1959) </ref> which are aligned with English translations of these sentences; and all the sentences in English and Spanish versions of H. A.

Reference-contexts: However, experiments in which all common structure was shared as in Figure 1 suggest that maximizing structure sharing would further improve performance. This structure-sharing approach is based on much previous work in optimizing Feature Structure based parsing. <ref> (See for example, Karttunen 1985 and Pereira 1985) </ref>. 4 The LCA-Preserving Algorithms 4.1 The Maximal Tree Alignment Problem A formal definition of the alignment problem corresponds closely to that found in Matsumoto et al. 1993. The algorithm finds a maximum-score correspondence between nodes in a pair of parse trees.
