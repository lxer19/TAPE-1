Title: Fundamentals of Restricted-Orientation Convexity  
Author: Eugene Fink Derick Wood 
Note: O-convex segment joining them that is wholly contained in the set.  
Abstract: We explore some of the basic properties of O-convex sets in two and higher dimensions. We also study O-connected sets, which are a subclass of O-convex sets, with several special properties. We introduce and investigate restricted-orientation analogs of lines, flats, and hyperplanes, and characterize O-convex and O-connected sets in terms of their intersections with hyperplanes. We then explore properties of O-connected curves; in particular, we show when replacing a segment of an O-connected curve with a new curvilinear segment yields an O-connected curve and when the catenation of several curvilinear segments forms an O-connected segment. We use these results to characterize an O-connected set in terms of O-connected segments, joining pairs of its points, that are wholly contained in the set. We also identify some of the major properties of standard convex sets that hold for O-convexity. In particular, we demonstrate that the intersection of a collection of O-convex sets is an O-convex set, every O-connected curvilinear segment is a segment of some O-connected curve, and, for every two points of an O-convex set, there is an

The O H -flats have all necessary properties of O-flats <ref> [2] </ref>: 1. Every translation of an O H -flat within the space H is an O H -flat. 2. A set 2 H is an O H -flat if and only if it is either H itself or the intersection of (d 2)-dimensional O H -flats (O H -hyperplanes).

Rawlins applied restricted orientations in his definition of two new types of generalized convexity, which he called O-convexity and strong O-convexity <ref> [16] </ref>. O-convexity, also called restricted-orientation convexity, was defined in terms of the intersection of a geometric object with lines parallel to the elements of a fixed orientation set O (see Section 2). <p> This extension yields a generalization of planar O-convexity and standard higher-dimensional convexity. In the first paper of the series [3], we described a generalization of strong O-convexity <ref> [16] </ref> to higher dimensions and explored the properties of strongly O-convex sets [4]. In the third paper [2], we describe a restricted-orientation generalization of halfspaces and investigate properties of these generalized half-spaces. We restrict our attention to the exploration of closed sets. <p> In Section 6, we present visibility results for O-convex and O-connected sets. Finally, we conclude, in Section 7, with a discussion of open problems and of future work. 2 O-convexity in two dimensions We begin by reviewing the notion of O-convexity in two dimensions <ref> [16] </ref> and presenting some of the basic properties of planar O-convex sets. Rawlins introduced this notion as a generalization of orthogonal convexity [14] and standard convexity. He defined O-convex 2 sets in terms of their intersection with straight lines, by analogy with one of the definitions of standard convexity. <p> As another example of an open problem, we have not characterized the boundaries of O-convex polytopes. In two dimensions, if the orientation set contains n lines, the boundary of every O-convex polygon can be partitioned into at most n O-convex polygonal lines <ref> [16] </ref>. We conjecture that a similar result holds in higher dimensions: for every finite orientation set O, there is some fixed number n such that the boundary of every O-convex polytope can be partitioned into at most n connected O-convex regions. <p> We also have not studied the computational aspects of O-convexity, such as verifying O-convexity and O-connectedness of a polytope and computing the O-convex hull. Finally, we may explore other generalizations of convexity, such as NESW convexity <ref> [16, 19] </ref>, in higher dimensions.

WWW: http://www.cs.ust.hk/faculty/dwood. 1 The application of convexity theory to practical problems [15] led to the exploration of nontraditional notions of convexity, such as orthogonal convexity [12, 13, 14], finitely oriented convexity [7, 24, 17], restricted-orientation convexity [16, 20, 21], NESW convexity [11, 22], and link convexity <ref> [1, 23, 21] </ref>. These nontraditional convexities have been used in pixel graphics, locked transaction systems, VLSI design, motion planning, and other areas. Guting introduced the notion of restricted orientations in two dimensions in his doctoral thesis [7].
