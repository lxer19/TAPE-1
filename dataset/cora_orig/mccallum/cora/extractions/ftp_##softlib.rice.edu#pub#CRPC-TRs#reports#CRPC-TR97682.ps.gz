Abstract: We present an expanded mixed finite element method for solving second order elliptic partial differential equations on geometrically general domains. For the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces, we use quadrature rules to reduce the method to cell-centered finite differences, possibly enhanced with some face-centered pressures. This substantially reduces the computational complexity of the problem to a symmetric, positive definite system for essentially only as many unknowns as elements. Our new method handles general shape elements (triangles, quadrilaterals, and hexahedra) and full tensor coefficients, while the standard mixed formulation reduces to finite differences only in special cases with rectangular elements. As in other mixed methods, we maintain the local approximation of the divergence (i.e., local mass conservation). In contrast, Galerkin finite element methods facilitate general element shapes at the cost of achieving only global mass conservation. Our method is shown to be as accurate as the standard mixed method for a large class of smooth meshes. On non-smooth meshes or with non-smooth coefficients one can add La-grange multiplier pressure unknowns on certain element edges or faces. This enhanced cell-centered procedure recovers full accuracy, with little additional cost if the coefficients or mesh geometry are piece-wise smooth. Theoretical error estimates and numerical examples are given illustrating the 1. Introduction. We discuss numerical methods for solving a second order accuracy and efficiency of the methods.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between the mixed method on rectangular meshes and cell-centered finite differences was first established in [29] provided that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later for general tensor K in <ref> [1] </ref> for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" [34, 22, 7, 1], again provided that the mesh is rectangular. <p> The relationship between the mixed method on rectangular meshes and cell-centered finite differences was first established in [29] provided that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later for general tensor K in [1] for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" <ref> [34, 22, 7, 1] </ref>, again provided that the mesh is rectangular. <p> This method achieves superconvergence at certain discrete points for both the pressure and velocity <ref> [32, 23, 33, 1] </ref>, and the number of unknowns is reduced to the number of cells or elements (which is much less than the number of edges or faces). <p> In the recently introduced expanded formulation <ref> [34, 22, 7, 1] </ref>, G is the identity. If instead G = K 1 , ~u = u and one recovers the standard mixed method formulation. Later we define G based on the local geometry. 3. An expanded mixed method. <p> In the special case of RT 0 spaces, a single subdomain, and rectangular elements, applying the trapezoidal (or "trapezoidal-midpoint" [29]) quadrature rule to (3.3) and (3.4) reduces A 2 to a diagonal matrix <ref> [29, 1] </ref>. The full matrix in (3.7) then becomes sparse. In fact, the method reduces to a cell-centered finite difference method, with only as many unknowns as elements (up to some additional unknowns near N and I ). Moreover, the accuracy of the approximate solutions is not compromised [33, 1]. <p> The full matrix in (3.7) then becomes sparse. In fact, the method reduces to a cell-centered finite difference method, with only as many unknowns as elements (up to some additional unknowns near N and I ). Moreover, the accuracy of the approximate solutions is not compromised <ref> [33, 1] </ref>. In this paper we remove the restriction to rectangular elements and a single subdomain. We begin by considering carefully the finite element spaces on irregularly shaped elements. 4. The mixed finite element spaces for general elements. <p> For geometrically irregular domains, the transformed coefficient K of (5.4) is necessarily a full tensor except in trivial cases. Because of our choice (5.1) of G, if there is a single subdomain boundary, the expanded problem on the computational grid (5.3) is the same as that analyzed in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> With a single subdomain, the method reduces to cell-centered finite differences with a stencil (see <ref> [1] </ref>) of 19 points if d = 3 and 9 points if d = 2 for ^ P in the Shur complement form of (3.2), i.e., (3.7). This is an approximation to the expanded mixed method. <p> Proof. When F = I, G = I or G = K 1 , and the usual affine (or special boundary) elements are used, the theorem (with a straightforward modification for the lower order term and the boundary conditions) can be found in <ref> [31, 28, 13, 5, 3, 4, 8, 1, 7] </ref>. The results for curved elements follow from the case of the usual elements applied to the transformed problem (5.3), using relations (4.1), (4.2), and (8.1). Remark. <p> The results for curved elements follow from the case of the usual elements applied to the transformed problem (5.3), using relations (4.1), (4.2), and (8.1). Remark. Other known estimates in H s and L p norms for affine elements <ref> [13, 3, 4, 17, 1] </ref> can also be transformed for curved elements. If the grid is rectangular, Raviart-Thomas spaces [28, 31, 25] are used, and K is a diagonal matrix, we have also superconvergence in the standard mixed method for the velocity error in certain discrete norms [24, 15, 16]. <p> The following definition concerning mesh refinement is needed for the next two results (cf. <ref> [1; Definition 5.2] </ref>).

Moreover, full second order superconvergence of the velocities is obtained in the strict interior of the domain <ref> [1; Theorem 5.10] </ref>. Theorem 8.4. <p> The results come from two different computer codes, one implemented to solve the problem on a logically rectangular grid, and the other implemented to use more general meshes. 9.1.

Reference-contexts: Many techniques have been developed for solving the saddle point systems that arise in the standard formulation [19, 18, 30, 11, 26, 10]. However, the saddle point problem can be avoided altogether by introducing additional Lagrange multiplier pressure unknowns on the boundaries of the elements <ref> [2] </ref>. This hybrid formulation allows one to eliminate the velocity and the original pressure unknowns from the system. A positive definite system results, but at the expense of greatly increasing the number of unknowns. <p> Second, if each i is itself a single element in the computational mesh, then I is the set of all internal element faces, and we have the full hybrid method with Lagrange multipliers on each face (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>). Third, we may partition into subdomains of intermediate size for purposes of domain decomposition on parallel computers, or to capture regions of smoothness in the coefficient K or in the mesh, so that we need put Lagrange multipliers only on subdomain boundaries (cf. [19]).

Reference-contexts: In these applications, accurate velocity approximations are required, and it is desirable that the conservation principle (1.1b) be satisfied locally, element by element. This precludes the use of Galerkin finite element methods, which only satisfy (1.1b) globally. Mixed finite element methods <ref> [28, 6] </ref> satisfy (1.1b) locally. The standard mixed method can be applied to general elements and general coefficients at the cost of a computationally expensive saddle-point linear system.

The construction of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements is more involved, and we review here the basic theory of Thomas <ref> [31] </ref>. We then generalize the mixed spaces, defined on ^ E, to curved elements. <p> We use the Piola transformation (see <ref> [31, 6] </ref>): For any function ^q 2 (L 2 ( ^ E)) d , define (4.2) q (x) = G (^q)(x) 1 DF ^q ffi F 1 Lemma 4.1. (q; r') E = (^q; ^ r ^') ^ E ; ' 2 H 1 (E); q 2 (L 2 (E)) d <p> If E h is a partition of into elements of standard shape, Thomas <ref> [31] </ref> defined for each E 2 E h and e @E, V h (E) = fv 2 H (div; E) : v ! ^v 2 ^ V h ( ^ E)g;(4.3) F fl h (e) = f 2 L 2 (e) : ! ^ 2 ^ fl h (^e)g;(4.5) and then <p> Also, there are no coefficients in the L 2 -vector inner-products on the left side of the first two equations. 6. Enhanced Cell-centered finite differences on logically rectangular grids. In this section we consider the RT 0 <ref> [28, 31, 25] </ref> spaces on curved but logically rectangular grids generated by taking a rectangular computational domain ^ , imposing on it a rectangular grid, and mapping it to by the function F . <p> There is a problem with the accuracy of this method, and we will return to it in x10. 8. Some convergence results. With the notable exception of the work of Thomas <ref> [31] </ref>, most of the known convergence estimates apply only to affine elements and special boundary elements. <p> properties of the mixed finite element spaces by l V and l W , where min kq vk 0 Ckqk l h l ; 1 l l V ;(8.2) min k wk 0 Ck k l h l ; 0 l l W ;(8.3) v2V h For the spaces of <ref> [28, 31, 25, 4] </ref>, l W = l V , while for the spaces of [5, 3], l W = l V 1. The spaces of [8] are a generalization of these other spaces on prisms. <p> Proof. When F = I, G = I or G = K 1 , and the usual affine (or special boundary) elements are used, the theorem (with a straightforward modification for the lower order term and the boundary conditions) can be found in <ref> [31, 28, 13, 5, 3, 4, 8, 1, 7] </ref>. The results for curved elements follow from the case of the usual elements applied to the transformed problem (5.3), using relations (4.1), (4.2), and (8.1). Remark. <p> Remark. Other known estimates in H s and L p norms for affine elements [13, 3, 4, 17, 1] can also be transformed for curved elements. If the grid is rectangular, Raviart-Thomas spaces <ref> [28, 31, 25] </ref> are used, and K is a diagonal matrix, we have also superconvergence in the standard mixed method for the velocity error in certain discrete norms [24, 15, 16]. <p> Remark. If multi-linear, quadrilateral and hexahedral elements are used, F is not continuous; however, we have approximation results because they hold element by element. If F is locally bilinear, then (see <ref> [31] </ref>) kDF k 0;1 Ch 1 and kDF k j;1 Ch 2 ; j 1; and the results are non-optimal. However, for the Raviart-Thomas elements in two dimensions, Thomas [31] extracted somewhat sharper estimates for the standard mixed method. Similar results can be obtained for the expanded mixed method. <p> If F is locally bilinear, then (see <ref> [31] </ref>) kDF k 0;1 Ch 1 and kDF k j;1 Ch 2 ; j 1; and the results are non-optimal.

Reference-contexts: This method achieves superconvergence at certain discrete points for both the pressure and velocity <ref> [32, 23, 33, 1] </ref>, and the number of unknowns is reduced to the number of cells or elements (which is much less than the number of edges or faces).

In fact, the method reduces to a cell-centered finite difference method, with only as many unknowns as elements (up to some additional unknowns near N and I ). Moreover, the accuracy of the approximate solutions is not compromised <ref> [33, 1] </ref>. In this paper we remove the restriction to rectangular elements and a single subdomain. We begin by considering carefully the finite element spaces on irregularly shaped elements. 4. The mixed finite element spaces for general elements.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between the mixed method on rectangular meshes and cell-centered finite differences was first established in [29] provided that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later for general tensor K in [1] for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" <ref> [34, 22, 7, 1] </ref>, again provided that the mesh is rectangular. <p> In the recently introduced expanded formulation <ref> [34, 22, 7, 1] </ref>, G is the identity. If instead G = K 1 , ~u = u and one recovers the standard mixed method formulation. Later we define G based on the local geometry. 3. An expanded mixed method.
