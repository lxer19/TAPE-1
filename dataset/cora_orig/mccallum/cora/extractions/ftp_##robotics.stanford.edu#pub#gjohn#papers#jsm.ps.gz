Abstract: Data mining is an umbrella term referring to the process of discovering patterns in data, typically with the aid of powerful algorithms to automate part of the search. These methods come from disciplines such as statistics, machine learning (artificial intelligence), pattern recognition, neural networks, and databases. Two data analysts with different heritages might approach a similar problem quite differently. In particular, this paper shows how the same problem, prostate cancer detection, is approached by an M.D. and a data mining analyst with a background in machine learning: hypothesis testing by the former, and bagged classification models by the latter. We then survey medical data analysis literature, describing the common statistical methods employed by physicians for clinical studies, and the advances in data mining and machine learning research that have been motivated by medical data analysis.

Reference-contexts: Note that the logistic regression model was actually doing better than the tree model for the PSA-Density only model, it had an area of 75.4% whereas the best tree has an area of 71.7 This called for some algorithm engineering. We used bagging <ref> (Breiman 1996) </ref> in an attempt to get better results. Instead of building a single model b f (x), we build many models b f i and combine them into a single model b f at the end where b f (x) = P b f i (x).

Reference-contexts: It is a resubstitution estimate, meaning that the same data that was used to build the logistic regression model is also being used to estimate the ROC curve. The curves therefore ought Size. to be slightly optimistic. Figure 4 shows ROC curves built using cross-validation <ref> (Breiman, Friedman, Ol-shen & Stone 1984) </ref>. These curves are unbiased. Note that the model built using all variables under-performs the model built using only PSA Density in the cross-validation curve but not the resubstition curve. <p> The (31; 100) patient would be in the upper left rectangle, where historically all patients have been free of cancer. The example tree was hand-constructed, but we will use the CART algorithm <ref> (Breiman et al. 1984) </ref> to build trees that fit the training data well. Figure 6 shows the ROC curve for CART trees (pruned using cross-validation, and using only complete records in the training set, those with no missing values), again using all variables, PSA Density only, or PSA only.

Reference-contexts: PSA density, for example, is the concentration of PSA found in blood divided by the volume of the prostate gland. Because BPH causes a much greater enlargement of the prostate than does cancer, some investigators hypothesize that patients with a high PSA density are more likely to have cancer <ref> (Presti, Hovey, Carroll & Shinohara 1996) </ref>. Urologists also consider what they find on a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE is used to detect any hard protuberance on the part of the prostate that is adjacent to the rectum. Such a finding may be indicative of cancer of the prostate.
