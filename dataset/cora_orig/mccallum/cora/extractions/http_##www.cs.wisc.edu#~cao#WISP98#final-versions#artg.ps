Reference-contexts: The robot runs on a 100 MHz Pentium with 32 MB of RAM with a NE 2000 NIC connected to a 10 base T Ethernet at New York University. The NYU campus is T3 connected to be Internet via NYSERnet <ref> [Chapman97] </ref>. We set low upper bounds on the computational delay in our WebPerf robot client by measuring the performance of a secure Web server located at NYU.

Reference-contexts: On top of TCP, the client and server establish a secure SSL communication channel <ref> [Freier96] </ref>. The client and server exchange secret session keys that will be used to encrypt and decrypt application messages.

Reference-contexts: The client and server exchange secret session keys that will be used to encrypt and decrypt application messages. On top of SSL, the client and server exchange one or more HTTP messages. (Multiple messages would be exchanged over keep-alive or persistent connections <ref> [Fielding98] </ref>.) When establishing an SSL channel the client and server may either create new session keys or reuse cached keys. Establishing an SSL channel first attempts to reuse a cached session key. Exchanging a cached session key takes one round-trip.
