Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of word-sense ambiguity in extraction from machine-readable resources for the construction of large-scale knowledge sources. We describe two experiments: one which ignored word-sense distinctions, resulting in 6.3% accuracy for semantic classification of verbs based on (Levin, 1993); and one which exploited word-sense distinctions, resulting in 97.9% accuracy. These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving semantic information from syntactic cues if we first divide the syntactic cues into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses. Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combination of online sources.

Reference-contexts: Others who have taken a more knowledge-based (interlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mi-tamura, and Nyberg, 1996) do not provide a means for systematically deriving the relation between surface syntactic structures and their underlying semantic representations. Those who have taken more argument structures into account, e.g., <ref> (Copestake et al., 1995) </ref>, do not take full advantage of the systematic relation between syntax and semantics during lexical acquisition. We adopt the central thesis of Levin (1993), i.e., that the semantic class of a verb and its syntactic behavior are predictably related.

Reference-contexts: We will see that our classification technique shows a 15-fold improvement in the experiment where we implicitly account for word-sense distinctions. 1 Both the database and the parser are encoded in Quin-tus Prolog. 2 The design of this experiment is inspired by the work of <ref> (Dubois and Saint-Dizier, 1995) </ref>. In particular, we depart from the alternation-based data in (Levin, 1993), which is primarily binary in that sentences are presented in pairs which constitute an alternation. Following Saint-Dizier's work, we construct N-ary syntactic characterizations.

These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving semantic information from syntactic cues if we first divide the syntactic cues into distinct groupings that correlate with different word senses. <p> Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel word senses using a combination of online sources, in particular, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978), Levin's verb classification scheme <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>, and WordNet (Miller, 1985). <p> Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons. 3 Syntax-Semantics Relation: Verb Classification Based on Syntactic Behavior The central thesis of <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> is that the semantics of a verb and its syntactic behavior are predictably related. As a demonstration that such predictable relationships are not confined to an insignificant portion of the vocabulary, Levin surveys 4183 verbs, grouped into 191 semantic classes in Part Two of her book. <p> In particular, we depart from the alternation-based data in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>, which is primarily binary in that sentences are presented in pairs which constitute an alternation. Following Saint-Dizier's work, we construct N-ary syntactic characterizations. The choice is of no empirical consequence, but it simplifies the experiment by eliminating the problem of naming the syntactic patterns.
