Abstract: We consider the problem of removing a given disk from a collection of unit disks in the plane. At each step, we allow a disk to be removed by a collision-free translation to infinity, and the goal is to access a given disk using as few steps as possible. This Disks problem is a version of a common task in assembly sequencing, namely removing a given part from a fully assembled product. Recently there has been a focus on optimizing assembly sequences over various cost measures, however with very limited algorithmic success. We explain this lack of success, proving strong inapproximability results in this simple geometric setting. Namely, we show that approximating the number of steps required to within a factor of 2 log 1fl n for any fl &gt; 0 is quasi-NP-hard. This provides the first inapproximability results for assembly sequencing, realized in a geometric setting. As a stepping stone, we study the approximability of scheduling with and/or precedence constraints. The Disks problem can be formulated as a scheduling problem where the order of removals is to be scheduled. Before scheduling a disk to be removed, a path must be cleared, and so we get precedence constraints on the tasks; however, the form of such constraints differs from traditional scheduling in that there is a choice of which path to clear. We prove our main result by first showing the similar inapproximability of this scheduling problem, and then by showing that a sufficiently hard subproblem can be realized geometrically using unit disks in the plane. Furthermore, our construction is fairly robust, in that is can be placed on a polynomially sized integer grid, it remains valid even when we consider only horizontal and vertical translations, and it also applies to axis-aligned unit squares and higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have worked towards classifying the approximability of different NP-hard problems. We consider four broad classes defined in <ref> [4] </ref>, which group problems based on the strength of the inapproxima-bility results which have been proven. Class I includes all problems for which approximating the optimal solution to within a factor of (1 + *) is NP-hard for some * &gt; 0 (e.g., Max-3Sat [38]). <p> [12], however the Rectangle Cover problem, covering a set of axis-aligned rectangles with minimum number of points, has no such inapproximability results [36]. 1 That is, this would imply NP DTIME (n poly (log n) ). "A proof of quasi-NP-hardness is good evidence that the problem has no polynomial-time algorithm." <ref> [4] </ref> 2 This factor, 2 log 1fl n , lies between polynomial and polylogarithmic in that 2 log 1fl n = o (n * ) for any * &gt; 0, and 2 log 1fl n = !(log c n) for any constant c. 3 Scheduling with and/or Precedence Constraints We can <p> We show the inapproximability of this problem by showing that the Fig. 1. LabelCover as and/or scheduling with internal-tree precedence LabelCover min problem is a special case. The LabelCover min problem, defined in <ref> [4] </ref>, is an artificial generalization of the Set Cover problem introduced in approximability theory. <p> It is easy to verify that the and/or instance has internal-tree precedence constraints. Notice that the number of non-leaf tasks in this construction is polynomially bounded in the size of the LabelCover min instance (namely, in jU j, jV j and N ). Combining this with the result of <ref> [4] </ref> which proves a similar lower bound for the approximability of LabelCover min , we get that it is quasi-NP-hard to achieve an 2 log 1fl n approximation for any fl0, when minimizing the number of leaves with internal-tree precedence constraints. <p> The LabelCover min results provide our strongest results even for the most general and/or scheduling problem, yet there is reason to believe this may be an even more difficult problem. It is already conjectured that LabelCover is truly n * -hard to approximate for some * &gt; 0 <ref> [4] </ref>, a result which would carry over through all of our reductions. However, we feel that the study of and/or scheduling may provide more meaningful implications in the approximation com plexity hierarchy. It may be possible to strengthen the lower bounds for and/or scheduling without necessarily settling the LabelCover conjecture.

Reference-contexts: For many of these restricted settings, polynomial algorithms have been designed which find an assembly sequence if one exists [1,19,22,43,45]. There are also algorithms which enumerate all possible assembly sequences <ref> [11] </ref>, however there may be exponentially many such sequences for a product. A logical continuation to this success is to use automated reasoning to find the "best" assembly sequence under certain complexity measures.

Reference-contexts: What distinguishes this setting from more traditional scheduling is the form of the precedence constraints. Commonly, a task may have what we term an and-precedence constraint, in that it has an associated set of tasks, all of which must be scheduled before that task <ref> [13] </ref>. Unfortunately, this is not the case in our assembly sequencing problem.

Theoretical results show that assembly sequencing, in its most general form, is intractable [27,31,32,37,46], and thus many researchers began considering restricted, yet still interesting, ver-sions of the problem. <p> A more complete framework for analyzing the approximability of many other cost measures for assembly sequencing problems is presented in <ref> [16] </ref>. In that work, many strong inapproximability results are shown in a non-geometric generalization, however with the exception of the Disks setting, the geometric lower bounds shown for other cost measures are far weaker than their non-geometric counterparts. A complete list of related problems and open questions is given there.

Reference-contexts: The strongest of these lower bounds, however, are not realized geometrically. For a restricted class of inputs which have a so-called "total ordering" property, a greedy algorithm is given which claims to produce the minimal length sequence to remove any given part <ref> [47] </ref>, however the required property does not have a clean definition, and as our results will show, this problem is quite difficult in general. Approximability Theory. As our optimization problems turn out to be NP-hard, we approach the problems using techniques common to the theory of approx-imability [4,13,28,36].
