Abstract: Internal vs. external: In internal sorting, the number of elements to be sorted is small enough to fit into main memory. In contrast, external sorting algorithms have to use auxiliary storage (disk) to store the elements to be sorted, and cannot assume random access of elements. In today's discussion, we will only consider internal, comparison-based sorting. a) Data Distribution We assume that input and output are distributed evenly across all processors. With multiple elements per processor, each processor stores a block of the elements. Instead of compare-exchange, use comparesplit. Two processors forward their local blocks to each other, then the foreign block and the local block are merged by techniques similar to that used in mergesort and only lower(upper) half is retained depending on whether minimum(maximum) is wanted.
