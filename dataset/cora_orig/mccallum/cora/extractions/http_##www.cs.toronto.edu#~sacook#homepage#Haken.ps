Title: An Exponential Lower Bound for the Size of Monotone Real Circuits  
Author: Armin Haken Stephen Cook 
Date: February 26, 1997  
Abstract: We prove a lower bound, exponential in the eighth root of the input length, on the size of monotone arithmetic circuits that solve an NP problem related to clique detection. The result is more general than the famous lower bound of Razborov and Andreev, because the gates of the circuit are allowed to compute arbitrary monotone binary real-valued functions (including AND and OR). Our proof is relatively simple and direct, and uses the method of counting bottlenecks. The generalization was proved independently by Pudlak using a different method, who also showed that the result can be used to obtain an exponential lower bound on the size of unrestricted cutting plane proofs in the propositional calculus.

Reference-contexts: An exponential lower bound for cutting plane proofs for clause sets based on a clique/coclique distinction, under the restriction that coefficients in the proof are polynomially bounded, was proved in <ref> [BPR95] </ref>, by reducing the problem to lower bounds for monotone Boolean circuits, and applying the Razborov/Andreev result mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Razborov/Andreev [Raz85] [AB87] [And85] exponential lower bound on the size of monotone Boolean circuits which detect cliques represented a breakthrough in the theory of monotone circuit complexity. The proof introduced the method of approximation, which has been used for other important lower bounds (see <ref> [BS90] </ref> and [Weg87] for expositions). Here we use the method of bottlenecks to give a simpler proof of a similar result. Our lower bound applies not just to monotone Boolean circuits, but more generally to circuits using gates which compute arbitrary monotone binary real-valued functions. <p> The result implies an exponential lower bound for the clique problem itself, since the clique problem is complete with respect to polynomial monotone projections for "monotone NP" (see <ref> [BS90] </ref>). An instance of the BMS is presented to the circuit as an n-tuple of values from f0,1g, and the output is either 0 or 1.

Reference-contexts: The measure of progress is the length of a fence which intuitively keeps track of how many bits of the input are actually used by the computation at that point. This method is similar to that used by Haken [Hak85] (and subsequently others [Urq87] <ref> [CS88] </ref>) to prove an exponential lower bound on the length of resolution proofs in the propositional calculus. In that case a large set of critical truth assignment vectors was mapped to clauses in the proof.

Reference-contexts: In that case a large set of critical truth assignment vectors was mapped to clauses in the proof. The result in the present paper has an application to cutting plane proofs <ref> [CCT87] </ref> in the propositional calculus. Cutting plane proofs provide a complete refutation system for unsatisfiable sets of propositional clauses. They efficiently simulate resolution proofs, and in fact are known to provide exponentially shorter proofs on some examples (the pigeonhole clauses).
