Title: SEPARATION OF VARIABLES AND THE COMPUTATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORMS ON FINITE GROUPS, I  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN AND DANIEL N. ROCKMORE 
Abstract: This paper introduces new techniques for the efficient computation of a Fourier transform on a finite group. We present a divide and conquer approach to the computation. The divide aspect uses factorizations of group elements to reduce the matrix sum of products for the Fourier transform to simpler sums of products. This is the separation of variables algorithm. The conquer aspect is the final computation of matrix products which we perform efficiently using a special form of the matrices. This form arises from the use of subgroup-adapted representations and their structure when evaluated at elements which lie in the centralizers of subgroups in a subgroup chain. We present a detailed analysis of the matrix multiplications arising in the calculation and obtain easy-to-use upper bounds for the complexity of our algorithm in terms of representation theoretic data for the group of interest. Our algorithm encompasses many of the known examples of fast Fourier transforms. We recover the best known fast transforms for some abelian groups, the symmetric groups and their wreath products, and the classical Weyl groups. Beyond this, we obtain greatly improved upper bounds for the general linear and unitary groups over a finite field, and for the classical Chevalley groups over a finite field. We also apply these techniques to obtain analogous results for homogeneous spaces. This is part I of a two part paper. Part II will present a refinement of these techniques which yields further savings.

Reference-contexts: For data analysis, these groups and their generalizations are of interest as the automorphism groups of the many designs based on finite geometries and codes (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). Throughout this section all matrix groups are assumed to be over F q , the finite field of q elements.

Reference-contexts: Then R is Z-adapted. Therefore if G = H fi K is a product of groups and H is abelian, then R is H-adapted. Proof. Part (i) is a result of Atkinson <ref> [2] </ref> and Karpovsky [42]. Part (ii) and its corollaries, parts (iii) and (iv), are simple consequences of Schur's lemma (cf. Lemma 4.2). Convention. Almost all of the results in remaining sections depend only on the adaptability of the representations and not the particular choice of adapted representation.

Reference-contexts: The abelian case has a long history (cf. [22, 23, 38]), and ever since the publication of the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform (FFT) [24] these algorithms have been at the heart of digital signal processing (see for example <ref> [3, 31, 63, 62, 66] </ref> and the many references contained therein). The nonabelian cases have also been motivated by applications.

Reference-contexts: Babai and Ronyai [6] have shown that a complete set of irreducible representations of a finite group G can be constructed in polynomial time from the multiplication table of G.

Reference-contexts: Strong generating sets arise 20 naturally in the context of many algorithmic issues in computational group theory [59]. In particular, fast algorithms for their construction for stabilizer subgroup chains in permutation groups are a cornerstone for many important techniques <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Adaptedness for a set of bases is defined similarly. Adapted bases always exist and in fact, can always be constructed. 6 To outline one such construction, we collect several previously known results. Babai and Ronyai <ref> [6] </ref> have shown that a complete set of irreducible representations of a finite group G can be constructed in polynomial time from the multiplication table of G.

Reference-contexts: A direct approach to the computation shows that the complexity is bounded above by jGj 2 . We conjecture that all finite groups have complexity O (jGj log c jGj) for some universal constant c. This has already been proved for many different classes of nonabelian groups <ref> [7, 18, 57, 55] </ref>. The first results of this type obtained for nonabelian groups are due to Willsky. In [65] Willsky studies a particular class of finite state Markov processes evolving on metacyclic groups.

Reference-contexts: When this point of view is adopted, the complexity of the Fourier 5 transform can be measured as the c-linear complexity of the associated change of basis matrix (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). The c-linear complexity of a group G is defined to be the minimum c-linear complexity of any such matrix for G. Assuming a choice of unitary representations (which is always possible) the results stated here can all be interpreted as statements about the 2-linear complexity of finite groups. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: It seems highly likely that better choices for either are possible.

Having obtained the form of the centralizers, the formulas in [16] p. 398 (see also the article of Springer and Steinberg in <ref> [14] </ref>), may be used to compute the dimensions of centralizers of unipotent elements, and hence to bound 43 dim C C 0 H (s) (u) in terms of the multiplicity m of 1 as an eigenvalue of s.

The familiar discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a finite data sequence and its efficient computation via the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform <ref> [24] </ref> has a natural formulation in terms of the representation theory of cyclic groups. Phrased in this context, the algorithm generalizes to an algorithm for computing Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups. <p> This type of chain can always be found in an abelian group and any chain of subgroups of A may be refined to such a chain. Hence the theorem is proved. The proof of Theorem 5.1 is essentially the derivation of the well-known Cooley-Tukey FFT <ref> [24] </ref>. Note that when jAj = 2 n we find that C (A) n 2 n = jAj log 2 jAj. For primes greater than 2 other techniques have been discovered for further optimizing the discrete Fourier transform (see, e.g., [31]).

The analyses of Sections 3 and 4 can be applied with virtually no changes to the computation of transforms on homogeneous spaces. <p> The separation of variables algorithm then amounts to calculating the inner product of a function and an associated spherical function by summing over one factor in the product at a time.

Applications in digital signal processing and data analysis motivated the need for a fast cyclic discrete Fourier transform (cf. the example of Section 2.1 and the references <ref> [22, 23, 38] </ref>) and more generally a fast Fourier transform on any abelian group [31, 53]. Application of Corollary 4.9 immediately gives us some well-known results bounding the complexity of the Fourier transform on any finite abelian group. Theorem 5.1.

Reference-contexts: Note that t j commutes with S k for k &lt; j 1: 23 Thus, in the notation of Section 4.3 K c + (t j ) = S j and Furthermore, it is easily derived from the combinatorics of Young tableaux and the "Branching Theorem" (cf. <ref> [39] </ref>, p. 34) that the maximum multiplicity occurring in the restriction of any irreducible representation from S k to S k2 is 2, i.e., M (S k ; S k2 ) = 2, so that M (t j ) = 2. <p> Remark. The bound of Theorem 5.2 is on the order of n!(log 2 n!) 3 . In this case the representations given by Young's orthogonal form or Young's seminormal form (cf. <ref> [39] </ref>, p. 114) are adapted for the chain of subgroups (36) for S n . The resulting algorithm is the fastest algorithm currently known for computing a Fourier transform on S n [21]. The above discussion for S n generalizes naturally to all Weyl groups. <p> Proof. (i) It is well-known that the restriction of an irreducible representation of S n to S n1 is multiplicity-free (see, e.g., <ref> [39] </ref>) as is that of B n to B n1 (see, e.g., [68]).

For a complete introduction to the representation theory of finite groups Serre's book <ref> [58] </ref> is a good reference. Recall that a (complex) matrix representation of a finite group G is a map from G into the group of d fi d invertible matrices with complex entries, GL d (C), such that (st) = (s)(t) for every s; t 2 G. <p> Elementary representation theory shows that the sum of the squares of the degrees of a complete set of irreducible representations of G is equal to jGj (see, e.g., <ref> [58] </ref>, p. 18). <p> This is the "conquer" portion of our divide and conquer strategy. The main tool we use is a form of Schur's Lemma. This simple result pins down the structure of intertwining matrices for a given matrix representation. Lemma 4.2 (Schur's Lemma). (see e.g. <ref> [58] </ref>, p. 13) Let K be a subgroup of G and a K-adapted representation of G such that = 1 1 r r where 1 ; : : : ; r are inequivalent irreducible matrix representations of K, and i occurs with multiplicity m i .
