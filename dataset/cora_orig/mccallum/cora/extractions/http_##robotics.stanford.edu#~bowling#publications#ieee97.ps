Title: Design of Macro/Mini Manipulators for Optimal Dynamic Performance

Abstract: This article investigates the problem of redundant manipulator design for optimal dynamic performance; specifically design of macro/mini structures. The dynamic performance of a manipulator is characterized by the inertial and acceleration properties of the end-effector. However, for redundant manipulators the characteristics of motions in the end effector null space must also be considered. This article presents a methodology for analyzing the performance requirements for the null space motions. The analysis also results in a decomposition of the overall design problem into a set of smaller subproblems. Here optimization techniques are used to determine the design parameters which improve manipulator performance. The decomposition greatly reduces the search space of the overall optimization. This article presents this methodology along with the models and measures upon which it is based. The approach is illustrated in the selection of design parameters for a simple six-degree-of-freedom planar mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The general approach has been to determine measures which quantify desired performance and then to base the design process on improving those measures. Some of these measures include Yoshikawa's dynamic manipulability [5], Asada's generalized inertia ellipsoid <ref> [1] </ref>, and Graettinger's acceleration radius [2]. However, these measures do not adequately deal with the problem of non-homogeneity between linear and angular acceleration, which is encountered when considering manipulators with greater than three degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: Analyses of inertial properties for macro/mini manipulator systems have shown that for all directions and configurations, the effective mass/inertia of a macro/mini manipulator is smaller than or equal to the mass/inertia associated with the mini manipulator structure considered alone <ref> [3] </ref>. This fact supports the proposed decomposition. Thus the main concern with respect to inertial properties is in making the mini properties as small and isotropic as possible in its workspace. The overall design process is shown in Figure 2. Here the optimization of the mini is performed first. <p> From these relationships the effective mass and inertia properties are described by the matrices, fl v and fl ! ; fl v = (J v (q)A 1 (q)J T and !

The inertial properties can be represented as a belted ellipsoid, Figure 3. k kg 3.2 Acceleration Capability End-effector acceleration capability is analyzed by determining the isotropic linear and angular accelerations; the largest amount of acceleration achievable at the end effector in or about every direction.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of manipulator dynamic performance involves issues dealing with how quickly the system responds to actuator commands and how well it reacts to contact forces and moments. Our previous work in this area focused on the design of non-redundant manipulators <ref> [4] </ref> and resulted in a set of characterizations and measures which were used to formulate the optimization problem. Here this approach is extended to redundant mechanisms; specifically macro/mini manipulator systems having twelve degrees of freedom (DOF). <p> From these relationships the effective mass and inertia properties are described by the matrices, fl v and fl ! ; fl v = (J v (q)A 1 (q)J T and ! (q)) 1 : (5) More details on the characterization of inertial properties can be found in [3] and <ref> [4] </ref>. The inertial properties can be represented as a belted ellipsoid, Figure 3. k kg 3.2 Acceleration Capability End-effector acceleration capability is analyzed by determining the isotropic linear and angular accelerations; the largest amount of acceleration achievable at the end effector in or about every direction.
