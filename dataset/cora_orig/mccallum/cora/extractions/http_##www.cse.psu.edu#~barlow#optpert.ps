Abstract: There is now a large literature on structured perturbation bounds for eigenvalue problems of the form where H and M are Hermitian. These results give relative error bounds on the i th eigenvalue, i , of the form We relax this restriction by allowing H to be singular. For our results on eigenvalues we allow M to be positive semi-definite and for few results we allow it to be more general. For these problems, for eigenvalues that are not zero or infinity under perturbation, it is possible to obtain local relative error bounds. Thus, a wider class of problems may be characterized by this theory. The theory is applied to the SVD and some of its generalizations. In fact, for structured perturbations, our bound on generalized Hermitian eigenproblems are based upon our bounds for generalized singular value problems. Although it is impossible to give meaningful relative error bounds on eigenvalues that are not bounded away from zero, we show that the error in the subspace associated with those eigenvalues can be characterized meaningfully. 1.

Reference-contexts: is positive definite, we give conditions under which we can bound the error in the subspaces in terms of a generalization of the relative gap relgap ( i ) = min j6=i j i j 2 j j j 2 This theory generalizes that in papers by Barlow and Demmel <ref> [1] </ref>, Demmel and Veselic [3], Veselic and Slapnicar [16], Gu and Eisenstat [9], Li [11, 12], Zha [19], and Eisenstat and Ipsen [4]. We make the following improvements to the theory given in the above papers: * The bounds on eigenvalues allow for H and M to be singular. <p> In x2, we give two simple bounds for the relative error of the form (1.4) under weaker assumptions than have been given in previous works <ref> [1, 16, 9, 8] </ref> and show how this theory can be applied to the SVD, the quotient and product SVD, and RSVD. In x3, we show how this theory accounts for the effect of structured perturbation on the problem (1.1). <p> The next theorem gives such a bound. Its proof follows that of Theorem 4 in <ref> [1, p.773] </ref>. Theorem 2.1. Let ( i (i); x i (i)) be the i th eigenpair of the Hermitian pencil in (2.2). Let S H (ffi H ) be defined by (2.3). <p> The componentwise version of Theorem 3.9 is obtained similarly as in x3.1. The following corollary yields a bound for the case of scaled perturbations discussed by Barlow and Demmel <ref> [1] </ref>. Here E H has the form E H = D fl F H D; kF H k = 1:(3.12) Corollary 3.10. Assume the hypothesis and terminology of Theorem 3.9. <p> 0 ( ~ i ; ffi H ) = k ( ~ i I fl 2 ) 1 j i j k; relgap 0 (; ffi H ) = min j relgap 0 (fl j ; ffi H ): The first definition (4.3) is just that from Barlow and Demmel <ref> [1] </ref>. The second definition (4.4) is the distance of a particular non-zero eigenvalue from all of the other non-zero eigenvalues. The third definition generalized the first to sets of eigenvalues. The fourth and fifth definitions generalize (4.4) to distance from the set of near zero eigenvalues. <p> We give examples for structured perturbations of x3, in particular for the relative componentwise perturbations of the type A = ffi A E A ; jE A j jAj: Such perturbations are highly interesting since they appear during various numerical algorithms for eigenvalue and singular value problems <ref> [1, 3, 7, 15, 16, 17] </ref>. Such perturbations are sometimes called floating-point perturbations [16]. The first two examples deal with the singular value decomposition and illustrate Corollary 3.3. Example 5.1. <p> In many circumstances, this is a more appropriate approach. Finally, the error bounds on individual eigenvalues and vectors tend to be tighter, sometimes much tighter, than the global error bounds for all of the eigenvalues of the matrix given in <ref> [1] </ref> or [16]. Moreover, they are easier to generalize to large classes of eigenvalue problems.
