Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) issues in networking environments cover various separate areas and topics. They include at least the specification of applications requirements, the definition of network services, QoS models, resource reservation methods, negotiation and transformation methods for QoS, and operating system support for guaranteed services. An embracing approach for handling, dealing with, and supporting QoS in different scenarios and technical set-ups is required to manage sufficiently forthcoming communication and networking tasks. Modern telecommunication systems require an integrated architecture for applications, communication subsystems, and network perspectives to overcome drawbacks of traditional communication architectures, such as redundant protocol functionality, weakly designed interfaces between the end-system and a network adapter, or impossibility of specifying and guaranteeing QoS parameter. This work contains the discussion of a number of interconnected QoS issues, e.g., QoS mapping, QoS negotiation, QoS-based configuration of communication protocols, or QoS aspects in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) signaling protocols, which have been dealt with during a one-year research fellowship. This report is not intended to be a complete description of every technical detail, but tries to provide a brief overall picture of the emerging and explosively developing QoS issues in telecommunication systems. Additionally, investigations of some of these issues are undertaken in a more closer detail. It is mainly focussed on QoS mapping, negotiation, and updating in the communication protocol area.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the survey identifies for several of selected approaches (such as Q.2931, UNI 3.1, or CMAP) important characteristics and relevant scenarios. Procedures and features of existing signaling systems and protocols and a brief proposal of high-level functionality and operations for a sufficient ATM-based signaling system may be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and are included in Appendix A completely. 4.1 QoS Negotiation in ATM Signaling Protocols Anticipating the discussion on QoS negotiations, within current ATM signaling protocols a QoS negotiation is quite restricted.

Reference-contexts: For QoS modelling the term service is important. The currently applied service definition is based on <ref> [3] </ref> and is used throughout this Section as follows: Definition of Service: Service comprises the aggregate of all capabilities and features, which are available at an interface between two layers, or in general, between two objects that are correlated. <p> The first dimension of QoS parameter distinguishes QoS parameters according to an architectural point of view, while three hierarchical levels may be separated. Network-dependent QoS | These N-QoS parameters are located in the two lowest levels of the ISO/OSI Basic Reference Model <ref> [3] </ref> and define capabilities of the network, its topology, and features of the medium itself. <p> During set-up time the number of connections per call defines the supported maintenance effort to be handled within the state machines of a signaling protocol. Different ATM transport services (data link layer services in the ISO/OSI Basic Reference Model <ref> [3] </ref>) can be supported. Additionally, the possibility to (re-)negotiate QoS parameters is important for traffic characteristic variations over the lifetime of a call. Maintaining issues concern the static or dynamic behavior of a call. <p> Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical QoS mapping approach based on OSI protocols. The approach taken includes enhanced QoS and leads to general mapping functions between QoS parameters. B.2 Architecture An OSI protocol stack comprises seven layers as defined in the ISO/OSI Basic Reference Model <ref> [3] </ref>. Each of them includes a limited set of QoS parameter definitions. Besides desirable consequences, such as efficiency, synchronization, or functional redundancy, the main consequence of these multiple-layer architectures concerns the urgency of QoS mapping between neighboring layers.

Reference-contexts: ITU-T Definition of QoS: The collective effect of service performances which determine the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service <ref> [5] </ref>. The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) definition assumes an abstract model of objects, while the ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardization Sector) includes the personal degree of satisfaction of a user. Even more, the detailed QoS parameter specified in different documents of protocols vary as well. <p> Work in standard bodies includes: * ISO communication protocols, such as TP4 [8] or CLNP [9], * QoS Basic Framework [4], * ITU-T Categories for Services [12], * ITU-T Recommendation E.800: Quality-of-Service and Dependability Vocabulary <ref> [5] </ref>, * ITU-T Recommendation I.350: General Aspects of Quality-of-Service and network Per formance in Digital Networks, Including ISDNs [13], and * ITU-T Recommendations for ATM, such as I.356 [6] and I.371 [14]. <p> Besides the considered OSI protocols of layers 4, 5, 6, [117], [118], [119] and the ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union) parameter definitions for layer 1 and 2 <ref> [5] </ref>, [13], [120] additional useful extensions of QoS parameters | based on [20] and [15] | are added. Due to the fact that the application, the transport system, and the network will interact by means of well-defined interfaces, a hierarchical structure of these QoS parameters is defined.

On one hand, services offered on top of traditional end-systems are quite restricted in the sense that only very simple QoS parameters can be specified. Examples can be found in existing transport protocols, e.g., TP4 [117], <ref> [8] </ref> and TCP [124]. They offer a limited number of QoS parameters: a jitter parameter is missing.

A number of emerging applications always extends these QoS parameters. <p> Approaches, such as the proposed flexible 14 protocol configurations [19], [47], and [48], require the tasks of updating their QoS parameter values. However in general, other areas of QoS-oriented work (such as modern protocols <ref> [10] </ref>, new architectures [49], enhanced service interfaces [19], [15], and operating system support [41], [31] (cf. Subsection 5.4)) have to be regarded in an integrated manner, providing a suitable solution for QoS guarantees within an entire networking environment. <p> These three different areas of research have been tackled often in separate approaches. Examples for bridging the service gap are the introduction of new services for request/response type of traffic and transaction-oriented traffic [126] or acknowledged datagram services <ref> [10] </ref>. The 3-component model [49] avoids problems with layered architectures and introduces much broader components to overcome intra-layer communication and to escape multiple sub-layers. <p> Examples for avoiding the performance bottleneck are manifold as well: efficient implementation of protocols ([127], [128], [129], [130], [131] and [132]) on one hand and the development of light-weight protocols, such as VMTP [133] or XTP <ref> [10] </ref>, on the other hand are possible. Furthermore, operating system support for protocol processing has been developed resulting in the design of the x-kernel [123].

Approaches, such as the proposed flexible 14 protocol configurations <ref> [19] </ref>, [47], and [48], require the tasks of updating their QoS parameter values. However in general, other areas of QoS-oriented work (such as modern protocols [10], new architectures [49], enhanced service interfaces [19], [15], and operating system support [41], [31] (cf. <p> Approaches, such as the proposed flexible 14 protocol configurations <ref> [19] </ref>, [47], and [48], require the tasks of updating their QoS parameter values.

Therefore, QoS issues and protocol configuration are closely related.

In this case, application requirements are specified by QoS parameters (which are handled by the application, the protocol, and the end-system) and are finally mapped onto protocol building-blocks and network-dependent parameters. <p> Nevertheless, an important target of a communication subsystem is to efficiently serve various applications with different requirements on top of a network using appropriate communication protocols. Therefore, a flexible and dynamic approach has been developed. The Function-based Communication Subsystem (F-CSS) <ref> [19] </ref> offers a framework to flexibly configure protocols according to application 9 The author is currently on leave from Universitat Karlsruhe, Institut fur Telematik, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany, and is sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities as a Research Fellow under the Human Capital and Mobility Scheme (RG 19372). 44 <p> Comparable but different approaches in terms of their main research aspects are ADAPTIVE [48] or Da CaPo [47]. C.2 Communication Protocol Configuration Regarded as an entire architecture, F-CSS includes certain features and tools <ref> [19] </ref>, [20]. These features, e.g., fine-grained QoS specification, defined by qualitative and quantitative criteria, flexibility, and automated protocol configuration, are supported and provided by tools. These tools are involved in the set-up, maintenance, and termination of so-called data streams and sessions. <p> Application Service Interface Application requirements strictly determine any required protocol communication service. A sufficient specification of these requirements can be done within two sets of QoS parameters: Quantitative Criteria and Qualitative Criteria <ref> [19] </ref>. These two distinct categories are used to define requirements at a different level. Quantitative criteria express application requirements in terms of certain quantities, such as "bits-per-second" or "errors-per-unit". These parameters can be specified by three distinct values, (1) an average, (2) a threshold, and (3) a useful value. <p> Furthermore, most traditional communication subsystems support reliability related Quality-of-Services (QoS) aspects only. Missing aspects include, e.g., synchronization, security, or the negotiation of QoS. Communication subsystems like ADAPTIVE [48], F-CSS <ref> [19] </ref>, [20], and Da CaPo [47], [137] try to reduce protocol complexity, increase protocol performance, and serve as well various QoS guarantees by introducing a protocol configuration approach. Further approaches for high-speed communication systems are presented and classified in [138]. The main principles of Protocol Configuration are decomposition and configuration.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, work on QoS in academia and industrial research centers include: * OSI'95 [15], * QoS-A (Quality-of-Service Architecture) [16], [17], [18] * F-CSS (Function-based Communication Subsystem) [19], <ref> [20] </ref>, * QoS Broker [21], [22], * CINEMA (Configurable Integrated Multimedia Architecture) [23], * QoS Management [24] * HeiTS (Heidelberger Transport System) [25], * Extended Integrated Reference Model [26], * TINA (Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture) [27], and * ANSA (Advanced Network System Architecture) [28]. 6 Criteria TP4 ISO E.800 I.350 OSI <p> Especially in the Function-based Communication Subsystem (F-CSS) [19] an enhanced application service interface is offered, allowing for the specification of various QoS-parameters that are used to configure a sufficiently application-tailored communication protocol. Details on the service interface, its QoS parameters, and service types may be found in <ref> [20] </ref>. 9.1 PROCOM The Protocol Configuration Manager (PROCOM) forms the main part of F-CSS, handling QoS requests and providing a description of an application-tailored protocol. <p> currently on leave from Universitat Karlsruhe, Institut fur Telematik, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany, and is sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities as a Research Fellow under the Human Capital and Mobility Scheme (RG 19372). 36 As depicted in Figure 12 (c), another possible approach has been proposed in [19], <ref> [20] </ref>, relying on protocol configuration and applying an internal QoS mapping scheme. In this case, application requirements are specified by QoS parameters (which are handled by the application, the protocol, and the end-system) and are finally mapped onto protocol building-blocks and network-dependent parameters. <p> Besides the considered OSI protocols of layers 4, 5, 6, [117], [118], [119] and the ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union) parameter definitions for layer 1 and 2 [5], [13], [120] additional useful extensions of QoS parameters | based on <ref> [20] </ref> and [15] | are added. Due to the fact that the application, the transport system, and the network will interact by means of well-defined interfaces, a hierarchical structure of these QoS parameters is defined. <p> Comparable but different approaches in terms of their main research aspects are ADAPTIVE [48] or Da CaPo [47]. C.2 Communication Protocol Configuration Regarded as an entire architecture, F-CSS includes certain features and tools [19], <ref> [20] </ref>. These features, e.g., fine-grained QoS specification, defined by qualitative and quantitative criteria, flexibility, and automated protocol configuration, are supported and provided by tools. These tools are involved in the set-up, maintenance, and termination of so-called data streams and sessions. <p> Additional tools in F-CSS, especially the Session Manager <ref> [20] </ref>, allows for sending one or multiple remote resource requests and transferring the answer (s) back to the initiating PROCOM. 47 REQUIRED- and FORBIDDEN-conditions. <p> Furthermore, most traditional communication subsystems support reliability related Quality-of-Services (QoS) aspects only. Missing aspects include, e.g., synchronization, security, or the negotiation of QoS. Communication subsystems like ADAPTIVE [48], F-CSS [19], <ref> [20] </ref>, and Da CaPo [47], [137] try to reduce protocol complexity, increase protocol performance, and serve as well various QoS guarantees by introducing a protocol configuration approach. Further approaches for high-speed communication systems are presented and classified in [138]. The main principles of Protocol Configuration are decomposition and configuration.

Reference-contexts: Approaches, such as the proposed flexible 14 protocol configurations [19], [47], and [48], require the tasks of updating their QoS parameter values. However in general, other areas of QoS-oriented work (such as modern protocols [10], new architectures <ref> [49] </ref>, enhanced service interfaces [19], [15], and operating system support [41], [31] (cf. Subsection 5.4)) have to be regarded in an integrated manner, providing a suitable solution for QoS guarantees within an entire networking environment. <p> The other QoS mapping has to take place at every interfaces of layers N and N-1. A different and more practical approach is presented in Figure 12 (b) and significantly reduces the number of QoS mapping functions. In this case, seven ISO/OSI layers have been reduced to three components <ref> [49] </ref>. Based on this architecture, three relevant groups of QoS mapping functions have been developed (cf. Section B.4). <p> These three different areas of research have been tackled often in separate approaches. Examples for bridging the service gap are the introduction of new services for request/response type of traffic and transaction-oriented traffic [126] or acknowledged datagram services [10]. The 3-component model <ref> [49] </ref> avoids problems with layered architectures and introduces much broader components to overcome intra-layer communication and to escape multiple sub-layers.

Reference-contexts: The general picture for the interoperation of communication protocols in an ATM environment providing user-to-user communications is stated in the B-ISDN Protocol Reference Model <ref> [54] </ref>. Signaling | being part of the ATM control and management plane as well | is the critical issue of interoperability in wide area ATM networks. <p> Finally, concluding this survey, Section A.4 proposes briefly important issues and characteristics for future signaling systems and protocols. A.2 Signaling in the ATM-based B-ISDN Relevant protocols for ATM are defined within a generic protocol architecture, the B-ISDN Protocol Reference Model <ref> [54] </ref>, which contains orthogonal dimensions for different layers and various functions.

Reference-contexts: In summary, UNI signaling specifies tasks and procedures between an ATM end-system and the next directly connected ATM switch. In the N-ISDN (Narrowband-Integrated Services Digital Network) environment the International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation Q.931 <ref> [56] </ref> has been introduced as an UNI signaling system. Nevertheless, this Digital Subscriber Signaling System No. 1 (DSS 1) could not be applied to ATM-based B-ISDN networks directly, since it did not include schemes for dealing with virtual paths and virtual channels. <p> The ITU-T Recommendations for the Signaling System No. 7 (SSN 7) in the Q.700-series [93] encompass the N-ISDN version of an NNI signaling system. Recommendations for the voice standard in N-ISDN are defined in Q.930 [98], Q.931 (similar to I.451) <ref> [56] </ref>, and Q.93B [99]. The Digital Subscriber Signaling System No. 2 (DSS 2) for B-ISDN in the final text of Q.2931 [57] and the draft text of Q.298x [58] is based on older versions (as Q.93B and Q.931).

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, this Digital Subscriber Signaling System No. 1 (DSS 1) could not be applied to ATM-based B-ISDN networks directly, since it did not include schemes for dealing with virtual paths and virtual channels. Therefore, the Digital Subscriber Signaling System No. 2 (DSS 2) in the Recommendation Q.2931 <ref> [57] </ref> (as well as extensions, such as multicast [58] and Quality-of-Service parameter negotiation [59], [60], [61]) has received final preparation at the ITU Study Group 11/Working Party 2, Question 15 "Updating and enhancement of ISDN user-network call control protocols". <p> Therefore, a SAAL (Signaling ATM Adaptation Layer) based on AAL type 5 [76] has been defined in the Recommendations Q.2100 [77], Q.2110 [78], Q,2120 [79], and Q.2130 [80]. E.g., Q.2931 <ref> [57] </ref> runs on top of SAAL, which in turn runs on top of the ATM layer. Different types of AAL may be used as well, e.g., SPANS [64] runs on 23 top of either AAL type 3 or type 5. <p> Recommendations for the voice standard in N-ISDN are defined in Q.930 [98], Q.931 (similar to I.451) [56], and Q.93B [99].

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) is in progress of defining a UNI signaling protocol, which is subdivided into basic call [100] and supervisory call [101] issues.
