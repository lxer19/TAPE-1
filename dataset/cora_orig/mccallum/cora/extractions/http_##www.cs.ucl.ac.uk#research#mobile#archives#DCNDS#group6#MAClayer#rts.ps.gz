Abstract: The distributed coordination function that is used as the access scheme for asynchronous traffic within the upcoming standard for wireless LANs IEEE 802.11 optionally applies the RTS/CTS message exchange to solve the hidden terminal scenario. In this paper, following a general discussion of the mechanism and its problems, we show the effectiveness or lack thereof of this mechanism in various cases like hidden terminals and fully meshed, optional (distributed) use of RTS/CTS and the dependencies from various parameters like physical preambles and packet sizes. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the results drawn from the simulations and an outline of problems that have yet to be investigated.

To solve this situation the RTS/CTS mechanism, developed in <ref> [3] </ref> and analyzed in [4], has been integrated in the DFWMAC in the following fashion: Each station seeking access to the medium selects a random slot within the contention window. The station with the earliest slot wins the competition and may start transmitting.

Reference-contexts: The station with the earliest slot wins the competition and may start transmitting. Stations with a later slot number hear the other station transmitting and refrain from sending ([1] and <ref> [5] </ref>). When the RTS/CTS mechanism is applied, the winning station does not send data packets right away but sends a RTS packet to the receiving station, that responds with a CTS packet.

Reference-contexts: We identified the following elements: configuration and geometry and the physical preamble length, but there might be further dependencies. 3. Discussing the RTS/CTS Mechanism in DFWMAC In order to analyze the behavior of the DFWMAC we simulated a possible network cell. We chose Ptolemy <ref> [6] </ref> as our simulation tool for several reasons: its an object oriented general purpose simulation tool with many connectable simulation environments (discrete event, synchronous data ow, concurrent processes) for several different simulation types.

Reference-contexts: We simulated a WLAN consisting of 8 stations using DFWMACs distributed coordination function as the access scheme with a raw physical throughput of 2 Mbit/s. The channel and packet source model is basically the same as it is described in <ref> [7] </ref>, i.e. Poisson distributed packet sources in a wireless channel model. In addition to that we simulated the signal run time, which can be left out if one only considers a range of a microcell, but which becomes considerable at distances of 300 m and more.

Reference-contexts: using RTS/CTS Using RTS/CTS Offered Load in % Throughput per station in % Using RTS/CTS Not using RTS/CTS 7.00 0.00 Access Delay in ms 50.00 100.00 200.00 Offered Load in % 150.00 RTS/CTS Analysis Page 9 For the following simulations we used packet sizes from an Ethernet trace (Leland trace, <ref> [8] </ref>) i.e. packet sizes are distributed as in real ethernet traffic with an average packet size of 682 byte. It shows that using the RTS/CTS mechanism permanently in this case is significantly better than not using it.
