Reference-contexts: X and fi are equipped with -fields X and fi . Let p ( ; ) be a conditional probability on X for 2 fi, that is, a function from X fi fi to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that for any 2 fi it is a countably additive probability measure on (X; X ), and p (B; ) be a fi -measurable function of for all B 2 X . The mapping p ( ; ) defines a model for a statistical problem. <p> For each observation x in X a statistician infers about by means of an inference function q ( ; x) defined for sets in A. The function q ( ; x) is a mapping from A fi X to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let A be a set in A. After x is observed q (A; x) represents the statistician's opinion on a likelihood of being in a set A x := f : (x; ) 2 Ag 2 fi . <p> Therefore, the 5 This assumption can be extended to integrability in a similar way as in Fubini's theorem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The main object of these notes is to present a simple characterization of coherent inference procedures. The concept of coherence rules out inference procedures with certain types of objectively verifiable deficiencies. This concept involves a behavioral interpretation of probabilities as has been recommended by de Finetti <ref> [4] </ref>. The key idea is to ask a statistician to accept bets on subsets of a parameter space at prices based on his own inference. The inference is coherent if we cannot beat the statistician.

Reference-contexts: The existence of a prior for an inference function can be seen as an analog for existence of a martingale measure. 1 One example can be found in Dubins <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 Bayes rule works only for countably additive probability measures. 3 t stands for total. 2 2 General framework and preliminaries Let X and fi be nonempty sets of possible observations and possible states of nature respectively. X and fi are equipped with -fields X and fi .

Reference-contexts: The question is, what kind of inferential methods should statisticians use to avoid such deficiencies in their models? The characterization of coherent inferential procedures for the case of a finite parameter space fi and a finite observation space X was studied by Freedman and Purves <ref> [6] </ref>. They showed that either a statistician makes an inference consistent with some posterior distribution or positive expected winnings can be attained for all values of in fi. This result was extended to arbitrary sets fi and X by Heath and Sudderth [8]. <p> Lemma 1 Suppose that '(x; ) is a bounded 5 and X fi fi -measurable function on X fi fi. Then the following function is fi -measurable: f () = X For testing an inference system we have to extend a game proposed by Freedman and Purves <ref> [6] </ref>. There are three participants in the game. A master of ceremonies arbitrarily selects in fi and then selects x in X according to the model p ( ; ). After x is chosen it is revealed to the other two players.

Reference-contexts: They showed that either a statistician makes an inference consistent with some posterior distribution or positive expected winnings can be attained for all values of in fi. This result was extended to arbitrary sets fi and X by Heath and Sudderth <ref> [8] </ref>. According to their 1 paper an inference is coherent if and only if it is consistent with a posterior distribution for some proper finitely additive prior. This implies that the Bayesian approach using proper finitely additive priors is the only way to go if coherence is to be maintained. <p> Finitely additive priors may fail to yield posteriors 1 and, even when a posterior exists, there is no simple technical device to calculate it 2 . Second, the coherence defined in <ref> [8] </ref> is not strong enough to avoid some undesirable deficiencies. Examples 5 and 6 below illustrates this point. In these notes we revise the general framework of Heath and Sudderth. We develop stronger types of coherence that exclude some deficiencies tolerated by the setting in [8]. <p> Second, the coherence defined in <ref> [8] </ref> is not strong enough to avoid some undesirable deficiencies. Examples 5 and 6 below illustrates this point. In these notes we revise the general framework of Heath and Sudderth. We develop stronger types of coherence that exclude some deficiencies tolerated by the setting in [8]. At the same time we are able to remove a superfluous requirement that the statistician puts odds on all subsets in some field of fi. In our setting he has an option to specify inferences only on some selected sets depending on the observation available to him. <p> Our characterization of coherence is as simple as the one obtained by Heath and Sudderth <ref> [8] </ref>. In fact, we reestablish the significance of the Bayesian approach in the new framework. We are thus able to restrict the set of priors statisticians should deal with to countably additive probability measures. This removes the technical difficulties of the result of Heath and Sudderth. <p> There is also a gambler who chooses a betting system after x is known and prices are posted. We slightly modify the definition of the betting system given by Heath and Sudderth in <ref> [8] </ref>. A simple betting system is a pair (b; A) where A is a set in A and b () is a bounded X -measurable function on X. <p> They are e-coherence, b-coherence, and t-coherence. There are two main differences between these types of coherence and the concept of coherence by Heath and Sudderth. In <ref> [8] </ref> Heath and Sudderth defined coherence only for conditional probability functions that have to be defined on some fields of sets. <p> The other major difference is that we use some reference measure on fi. If compared to b and t types, the idea of e-coherence is the closest to the definition of coherence in <ref> [8] </ref>. However, even for e-coherence we need the concept of a reference measure. The next paragraph provides some insight into the concept of a reference measure. <p> The next paragraph provides some insight into the concept of a reference measure. It also shows how the concept of e coherence, where e stands for extended, could be developed from the concept of coherence by Heath and Sudderth. 7 The definition of coherence in <ref> [8] </ref> could be translated into our setting of inference systems (q; A) by conditions A = X fi fi and inf 2fi ~() &gt; 0; 8~ 2 V IS . From now on we will restrict our interpretation of coherence by Heath and Sudderth only to the second condition. <p> From now on we will restrict our interpretation of coherence by Heath and Sudderth only to the second condition. Restriction A = X fi fi will be ignored since it is unnecessary in our setting. 7 In <ref> [8] </ref> coherence of an inference q ( ; x) corresponds to the absence of functions ~ in V IS with inf 2fi ~() &gt; 0. <p> Definition An inference system (q; A) is called e-coherent with respect to a reference measure M if V IS contains no ~ such that ~ 0 a:s: [M] and ~ 6= 0 [M]. Example 5 Consider the inference system (q; A) from Example 2. As it was shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, the posterior probability measure q ( ; x) is coherent in a sense of the definition of Heath and Sudderth. Take a simple betting system (b; A) where A = f (x; ) : xg and b is any bounded measurable monotonically 8 increasing function of x. <p> expected payoff function equals ~() = p 2 X S p # fi fi fi fi fi B 2 p (B): As follows from inequality (5), ~() 6 8 t ff denotes the ffth critical value of the t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. 9 See Example 4.2 in <ref> [8] </ref>. 9 for all possible values of = (; 2 ).
