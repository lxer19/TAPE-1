Abstract: The spectral method is the best currently known technique to prove lower bounds on expansion. Ramanujan graphs, which have asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue, are the best known explicit expanders. The spectral method yielded a lower bound of k=4 on the expansion of linear sized subsets of k-regular Ramanujan graphs. We improve the lower bound on the expansion of Ramanujan graphs to approximately k=2. Moreover, we construct a family of k-regular graphs with asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue and linear expansion equal to k=2. This shows that k=2 is the best bound one can obtain using the second eigenvalue method. We also show an upper bound of roughly 1 + For a linear-sized subset X and integer t 2, we show that the set of nodes at distance t from X has size at least k(k 2)(k 1) t2 jXj=2. Given a graph H, we exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a family of k-regular graphs having a given asymptotic bound on the second eigenvalue, and containing H as an induced subgraph. As a byproduct, we obtain improved bounds on random walks on expanders, we construct selection networks (resp. extrovert graphs) of smaller size (resp. degree) than was previously known, and we construct highly expanding non-Ramanujan graphs. fl This work was partially supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contracts N00014-92-J-1799 and N00014-91-J-1698, the Air Force under Contract F49620-92-J-0125, and the Army under Contract DAAL-03-86-K-0171.

Reference-contexts: Tanner [40] proved that for any subset X of V , jN (X)j 2 + (k 2 2 )jXj=n Therefore, in order to get high expansion, we want to find graphs with as small as possible. However, Alon and Boppana [3] (see <ref> [30, 34] </ref> for the proof) showed that, for any sequence G n;k of k-regular graphs on n vertices, lim inf (G n;k ) 2 p k 1 as n goes to infinity. <p> This bound is achieved by Ramanujan graphs. By definition, a Ramanujan graph is a connected k-regular graph whose eigenvalues 6= k are at most 2 p k 1 in absolute value. Ramanujan graphs, have been explicitly constructed by <ref> [30, 33] </ref> for many pairs (k; n). Fig. 1 represents a Ramanujan graph on 8 vertices. <p> Roughly speaking, we show that an eigenvector of G n associated to a large eigenvalue corresponds to an eigenvector of the original graph with the same eigenvalue, and thereby conclude that G n is almost Ramanujan. From <ref> [30] </ref> and [33], we know that we can explicitly construct an infinite family of bipartite Ramanujan graphs (F n ) on n vertices whose girth is (4=3 + o (1)) log k1 n. <p> Theorem 2 implies that the linear expansion of the family (G n ) is at least k=2. Since the subset fu; u 0 g has k neighbors, this bound is tight. If k 1 is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4, we know from <ref> [30] </ref> that there exists an infinite family of non-bipartite k-regular Ramanujan graphs with girth at least (2=3 + o (1)) log k1 n. <p> Proof The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 7. Let X be the vertex set of H. Consider an explicit family of non-bipartite Ramanujan <ref> [30] </ref> graphs (F n ) on n vertices whose girth is (2=3 + o (1)) log k1 n. Let F n = (V; E) be an element of the family. <p> Indeed, it implies that 0 (M (1+o (1)) H ) (1 + o (1)). As n goes to infinity, we get Condition 3 by continuity. Condition 3 implies Condition 1 by Theorem 8. 7 Expansion of subsets of sublinear size The graphs constructed in <ref> [30, 33] </ref> besides being Ramanujan, have other properties such as high girth. In particular, the bipartite Ramanujan graphs constructed in [30, 33] have girth (4=3o (1)) log k1 n. We will use this property to get high expansion for subsets of sublinear size. <p> Condition 3 implies Condition 1 by Theorem 8. 7 Expansion of subsets of sublinear size The graphs constructed in <ref> [30, 33] </ref> besides being Ramanujan, have other properties such as high girth. In particular, the bipartite Ramanujan graphs constructed in [30, 33] have girth (4=3o (1)) log k1 n. We will use this property to get high expansion for subsets of sublinear size. Proposition 1 Let G = (V; E) be a k-regular graph of girth (4=3 + o (1)) log k1 n. <p> Assume now that the girth of G t is greater than 2t. Then G t is regular of degree k (k 1) t1 . As in <ref> [30, 17] </ref>, we see that the adjacency matrix of G t satisfies the equality A G t = A G A G t1 (k 1)A G t2 , for t 3.

Reference-contexts: However, the explicit construction of expander graphs is much more difficult. The first explicit construction of an infinite family of expanders was discovered by Margulis <ref> [32] </ref> in 1973. Using deep results in group representation theory, he proved a lower bound on the expansion that exceeds 1 by an undetermined but positive factor. In 1981, Gabber and Galil [19] constructed similar graphs and gave an estimate of their expansion coefficient using techniques from harmonic analysis.

Reference-contexts: This bound is achieved by Ramanujan graphs. By definition, a Ramanujan graph is a connected k-regular graph whose eigenvalues 6= k are at most 2 p k 1 in absolute value. Ramanujan graphs, have been explicitly constructed by <ref> [30, 33] </ref> for many pairs (k; n). Fig. 1 represents a Ramanujan graph on 8 vertices. <p> Roughly speaking, we show that an eigenvector of G n associated to a large eigenvalue corresponds to an eigenvector of the original graph with the same eigenvalue, and thereby conclude that G n is almost Ramanujan. From [30] and <ref> [33] </ref>, we know that we can explicitly construct an infinite family of bipartite Ramanujan graphs (F n ) on n vertices whose girth is (4=3 + o (1)) log k1 n. <p> Indeed, it implies that 0 (M (1+o (1)) H ) (1 + o (1)). As n goes to infinity, we get Condition 3 by continuity. Condition 3 implies Condition 1 by Theorem 8. 7 Expansion of subsets of sublinear size The graphs constructed in <ref> [30, 33] </ref> besides being Ramanujan, have other properties such as high girth. In particular, the bipartite Ramanujan graphs constructed in [30, 33] have girth (4=3o (1)) log k1 n. We will use this property to get high expansion for subsets of sublinear size. <p> Condition 3 implies Condition 1 by Theorem 8. 7 Expansion of subsets of sublinear size The graphs constructed in <ref> [30, 33] </ref> besides being Ramanujan, have other properties such as high girth. In particular, the bipartite Ramanujan graphs constructed in [30, 33] have girth (4=3o (1)) log k1 n. We will use this property to get high expansion for subsets of sublinear size.

Reference-contexts: Tanner [40] proved that for any subset X of V , jN (X)j 2 + (k 2 2 )jXj=n Therefore, in order to get high expansion, we want to find graphs with as small as possible. However, Alon and Boppana [3] (see <ref> [30, 34] </ref> for the proof) showed that, for any sequence G n;k of k-regular graphs on n vertices, lim inf (G n;k ) 2 p k 1 as n goes to infinity.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Kelsen [27] designed a randomized local algorithm for finding such a matching in a logarithmic number of steps provided that the expansion is ( p k log k). Pippenger <ref> [35] </ref> showed that weak expanders are sufficient in applications where an expansion greater than k=2 was required.

Reference-contexts: The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are f3; p p This graph is Ramanujan since its second largest eigenvalue p 5 is less than 2 p the second largest eigenvalue. An excellent survey on expanders is found in [9]. The recent books by Sarnak <ref> [37] </ref> and Lubotzky [29] give a mathematical background on the construction of Ramanujan graphs. Other results about graph spectra are contained in [10, 15, 16]. Some applications, such as the construction of non-blocking networks in [7], required an expansion greater than k=2 of linear-sized subsets.
