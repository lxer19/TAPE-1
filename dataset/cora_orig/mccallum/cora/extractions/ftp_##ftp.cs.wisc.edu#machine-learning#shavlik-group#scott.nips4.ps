Abstract: The Kbann approach uses neural networks to refine knowledge that can be written in the form of simple propositional rules. We extend this idea further by presenting the Manncon algorithm by which the mathematical equations governing a PID controller determine the topology and initial weights of a network, which is further trained using backpropagation. We apply this method to the task of controlling the outflow and temperature of a water tank, producing statistically-significant gains in accuracy over both a standard neural network approach and a non-learning PID controller. Furthermore, using the PID knowledge to initialize the weights of the network produces statistically less variation in testset accuracy when compared to networks initialized with small random numbers.

Reference-contexts: A simple vector difference, e = y sp y accomplishes this. The second layer, that between e, " (n1) , and ", calculates the actual error to be passed to the PID mechanism. In effect, this layer acts as a steady-state pre-compensator <ref> (Ray, 1981) </ref>, where " = G I e and produces the current error and the error signals at the past two time steps. This compensator is a constant matrix, G I , with values such that interactions at a steady state between the various control loops are eliminated.

Reference-contexts: Finally, there are a number of existing controller paradigms which can be used to determine the topology and the initial weights of the network. 2 CONTROLLER NETWORKS The Manncon algorithm uses a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller <ref> (Stephanopoulos, 1984) </ref>, one of the simplest of the traditional feedback controller schemes, as the basis for the construction and initialization of a neural network controller. <p> The controller cannot measure the disturbances, which represent noise in the system.

There are several other controller paradigms that could be used as a basis for network construction and initialization.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Research into the design of neural networks for process control has largely ignored existing knowledge about the task at hand. One form this knowledge (often called the "domain theory") can take is embodied in traditional controller paradigms. The recently-developed Kbann (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) approach <ref> (Towell et al., 1990) </ref> addresses this issue for tasks for which a domain theory (written using simple propositional rules) is available. <p> The controller cannot measure the disturbances, which represent noise in the system. Manncon initializes the weights of Figure 1's network with values that mimic the behavior of a PID controller tuned with Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) parameters (Stephanopoulos, 1984) at a particular operating condition. Using the Kbann approach <ref> (Towell et al., 1990) </ref>, it adds weights to the network such that all units in a layer are connected to all units in all subsequent layers, and initializes these weights to small random numbers several orders of magnitude smaller than the weights determined by the PID parameters.
