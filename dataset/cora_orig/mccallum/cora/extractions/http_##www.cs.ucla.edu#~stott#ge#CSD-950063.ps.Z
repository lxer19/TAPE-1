Reference-contexts: Stott Parker 5 The algorithm can be applied most flexibly when the nonsingular matrix A is also Gauss nondegenerate: Definition 4 A p fi q matrix M of rank n is Gauss nondegenerate if, for all 1 k n, Mhki is nonsingular. It is well-known <ref> [2, p.96] </ref> that if A is a nonsingular matrix, then Gaussian elimination (without augmentation by pivoting) is well-defined iff A is Gauss nondegenerate. We have shown elsewhere [5, 6] how input randomization can be used to efficiently achieve Gauss nondegeneracy (with probability 1) given any nonsingular matrix.
