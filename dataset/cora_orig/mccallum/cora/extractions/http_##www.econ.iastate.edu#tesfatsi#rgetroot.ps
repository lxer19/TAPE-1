Abstract: This paper presents a summary overview of the fast-developing field of artificial life, stressing aspects especially relevant for the study of decentralized market economies. In particular, a recently developed trade network game (TNG) is used to illustrate how the basic artificial life paradigm might be specialized to economics. The TNG traders choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continually updated expected utility, engage in risky trades mod-elled as two-person games, and evolve their trade behavior over time. Analytical and simulation work is reported to indicate how the TNG is currently being used to study the evolutionary implications of alternative market structures at three different levels: individual trade behavior; trade network formation; and social welfare.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction What is artificial life, or alife for short? And why should economists care? As detailed in the entertaining monographs by Levy (1992) and Sigmund <ref> (1993) </ref>, the roots of alife go at least as far back as the work of John von Neumann in the nineteen forties on self-replicating automata. <p> These and numerous other related studies are reviewed by Witt <ref> (1993) </ref> and Nelson (1995). In addition, as detailed in Friedman (1991), a number of researchers have recently been focusing on the potential economic applicability of evolutionary game theory in which game strategies distributed over a fixed number of strategy types reproduce over time in direct proportion to their relative fitness. <p> Several studies that focus on key ACE-related issues have either appeared or are in the pipeline. See, for example, Anderson et al. (1988), Arifovic (1994), Arthur <ref> (1993) </ref>, Arthur et al.

The TNG facilitates the general study of trade from a bottom up perspective in three key ways. First, the TNG traders are instantiated as autonomous endogenously interacting software agents (tradebots) with internal behavioral functions and with internally stored information that includes addresses for other trade-bots. <p> Third, the evolutionary implications of alternative module specifications can be studied at three different levels: individual tradebot 3 Other game theory studies that have allowed players to avoid unwanted interactions, or more generally to affect the probability of interaction with other players through their own actions, include Fogel <ref> (1995) </ref>, Guriev and Shakhova (1996), Hauk (1996), Hirshleifer and Rasmusen (1989), Kitcher (1993), Mailath et al. (1994), and Orbell and Dawes (1993). A detailed review of this line of work is given in Hauk (1996). <p> There is also a growing body of work on multi-agent systems with endogenous interactions in which the decision (or state) of an agent depends on the decision (or state) of certain neighboring agents, where these neighbors may change over time. See, for example, Brock and Durlauf <ref> (1995) </ref>, De Vany (1996), Ioannides (1997), and Young (1993). 4 characteristics; trade network formation; and social welfare as measured by descriptive statistics such as average tradebot fitness.

Reference-contexts: The establishment of alife as a distinct field of inquiry, however, must be traced to the first alife conference, organized in 1987 by Chris Langton at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; see Langton <ref> (1989) </ref>. Alife is the bottom-up study of basic phenomena commonly associated with living organisms, such as self-replication, evolution, adaptation, self-organization, parasitism, competition, cooperation, and social network formation. <p> See Goldberg <ref> (1989) </ref> and Mitchell and Forrest (1994). The central problem for ACE researchers is to understand the apparently spontaneous appearance of regularity in economic processes, such as the unplanned coordination of trading activities in decentralized market economies that economists associate with Adam Smith's invisible hand. <p> Arthur (1993), Arthur et al.
