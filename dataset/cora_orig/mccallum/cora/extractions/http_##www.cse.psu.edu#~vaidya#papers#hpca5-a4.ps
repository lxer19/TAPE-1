Abstract: Earlier research has shown that adaptive routing can help in improving network performance. However, it has not received adequate attention in commercial routers mainly due to the additional hardware complexity, and the perceived cost and performance degradation that may result from this complexity. These concerns can be mitigated if one can design a cost-effective router that can support adaptive routing. This paper proposes a three step recipe Look-Ahead routing, intelligent Path Selection, and an Economic Storage implementation, called the LAPSES approach for cost-effective high performance pipelined adaptive router design. The first step, look-ahead routing, reduces a pipeline stage in the router by making table lookup and arbitration concurrent. Next, three new traffic-sensitive path selection heuristics (LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT) are proposed to select one of the available alternate paths. Finally, two techniques for reducing routing table size of the adaptive router are presented. These are called meta-table routing and economical storage. The proposed economical storage needs a routing table with only 9 and 27 entries for two and three dimensional meshes, respectively. All these design ideas are evaluated on a (16 fi 16) mesh network via simulation. A fully adaptive algorithm and various traffic patterns are used to examine the performance benefits. Performance results show that the look-ahead design as well as the path selection heuristics boost network performance, while the economical storage approach turns out to be an ideal choice in comparison to full-table and meta-table options. We believe the router resulting from these three design enhancements can make adaptive routing a viable choice for interconnects.

Reference-contexts: The two main cost factors associated with providing adaptivity in a router are the number of VCs required and the implementation of the algorithm itself. It was argued in <ref> [4] </ref> that addition of each VC slows down the router clock by 2530%. This is only true for a non-pipelined design. Current commercial routers are being designed with increasingly large transistor and area budgets.

Reference-contexts: Flits of a message that temporarily cannot make progress because of currently unavailable network resources, are held in the flit buffers. To support VCs, a VC de-multiplexor unit precedes the input flit buffers and a VC multiplexor precedes the output port of the router <ref> [6, 24] </ref>. In an adaptive router, the routing decision block may have a choice of crossbar output ports to route a message. A path selection function is required in the routing decision block to select one of multiple valid output ports.

MIN-MUX uses the physical channel with the minimum degree of VC-multiplexing (For details about the MIN-MUX PSH, see <ref> [9] </ref>). Least Frequently Used (LFU) PSH: This PSH selects the output port (among the candidates) with the lowest usage count until that time. It works on the premise that if link utilizations are balanced, it will result in improved network performance. <p> In each of the figures the labels in small-type indicate the complete address of a node in the mesh, and the labels in large type indicate cluster labels. mesh routing algorithms such as those in <ref> [15, 9, 22, 2] </ref> can be implemented with the economical storage. Hence, performance of full-table routing and economical storage routing are identical. The results comparing the performance of the two meta-table mapping schemes and the full-table and ES tables are presented in Table 4. <p> The results further suggest that the look-ahead feature should be more attractive for short message transfer typically encountered in shared memory systems. It is shown that the new path selection strategies can utilize the available paths more prudently than the static-XY scheme and the MIN-MUX scheme <ref> [9] </ref> and hence can contribute to low message latency. The network latency thus reduces significantly for non-uniform traffic patterns. The two-level, meta-table implementation of adaptive routing algorithm severely affects the performance in a 2-D mesh due to traffic congestion at the boundary nodes between clusters.

Reference-contexts: Since low latency in general translates to high throughput, a network should provide minimal latency over the entire, anticipated workload on the system. Moreover, network architectures, designed originally for multiprocessors, are increasingly being accepted in demanding application domains such as web servers and multimedia servers <ref> [16] </ref>. A more general environment such as a system area network is likely to experience high and fluctuating workloads. Enhancing network performance is thus imperative to fuel continued improvements not only in parallel architectures but also on many other fronts.

Complexity and cost are the main reasons attributed to the limited commercial adoption of adaptive routing. <p> The number of such non-overlapping intervals is equal to the number of router exit ports. It has been shown that interval labeling schemes can be derived for any connected network, hence also the name universal routing. The Transputer/C-104 switch <ref> [18] </ref> uses interval routing. This scheme has significant advantages in terms of the small table size, excellent scalability and applicability to arbitrary topologies.

An adaptive router should, therefore, adhere to a pipelined design and should exploit all available facilities such as VCs and table based routing. VCs are thus not considered an additional expense. <p> However, in order to increase the throughput, modern routers use a pipelined design <ref> [12, 21, 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Simulation data was collected by injecting 10000 warm-up messages after which statistics was collected over 400000 message injections. A summary of the simulation parameters used in this study is given in Table 2. 2.3 Adaptive Routing Algorithms Several adaptive routing algorithms have been proposed for direct networks <ref> [15, 14, 9, 22, 2, 5] </ref>. These algorithms vary in terms of their performance and hardware (VC) requirements. Since we are interested in a cost-effective implementation, we use a fully adaptive routing algorithm that requires the minimum number of VCs. <p> These algorithms vary in terms of their performance and hardware (VC) requirements. Since we are interested in a cost-effective implementation, we use a fully adaptive routing algorithm that requires the minimum number of VCs. The algorithms that meet this criteria are those in <ref> [14, 2, 9, 22] </ref> and they require 2 VCs per physical channel for deadlock-free adaptive routing in a 2-D mesh. <p> In each of the figures the labels in small-type indicate the complete address of a node in the mesh, and the labels in large type indicate cluster labels. mesh routing algorithms such as those in <ref> [15, 9, 22, 2] </ref> can be implemented with the economical storage. Hence, performance of full-table routing and economical storage routing are identical. The results comparing the performance of the two meta-table mapping schemes and the full-table and ES tables are presented in Table 4.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a large credit value for a link is indicative of possibly low congestion at the downstream router. The MAX-CREDIT PSH hence picks the channel with maximum available credits from amongst the available candidate channels. Implementation details of these schemes can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. 4.2 Performance of Path Selection Heuristics MAX-CREDIT). The results are for a (16 fi 16) network with four different traffic patterns. As expected, the static path selection performs the best for uniform traffic, although MIN-MUX, LRU and MAX-CREDIT heuristics are comparable except at very high load. <p> In the interest of brevity, we have only presented a basic implementation for the ES scheme here. It is, however, possible to implement ES with lookahead, provide minimal path routing n-dimensional tori, and support irregular topologies. (See <ref> [23] </ref>.) 5.2.2 Adaptive Routing Performance Comparison with Var ious Table Storage Schemes Table storage optimizations come with an associated tradeoff that of decreased routing flexibility. It is thus, important to study the performance impact of lowering table storage requirements.

Reference-contexts: Flits of a message that temporarily cannot make progress because of currently unavailable network resources, are held in the flit buffers. To support VCs, a VC de-multiplexor unit precedes the input flit buffers and a VC multiplexor precedes the output port of the router <ref> [6, 24] </ref>. In an adaptive router, the routing decision block may have a choice of crossbar output ports to route a message. A path selection function is required in the routing decision block to select one of multiple valid output ports.

Reference-contexts: This type of storage savings are used in the SGI-SPIDER (2-level) [12] and the Servernet-II router [13] (3-levels). For adaptive routing, the sub-cluster routing table as well as the cluster routing table (s) need to support multiple entries per index. 5.1.2 Interval/Universal Routing Interval routing <ref> [25] </ref> reduces table-size on a router to the smallest possible size equal to the number of router ports, thus making the table-size independent of the number of nodes in the interconnection network.
