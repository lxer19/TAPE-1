Abstract: As more online databases are integrated into digital libraries, the issue of quality control of the data becomes increasingly important, especially as it relates to the effective retrieval of information. The need to discover and reconcile variant forms of strings in bibliographic entries, i.e., authority work, will become more critical in the future. Spelling variants, misspellings, and transliteration differences will all increase the difficulty of retrieving information. Approximate string matching has traditionally been used to help with this problem. In this paper we introduce the notion of approximate word matching and show how it can be used to improve detection and categorization of variant forms.

Reference-contexts: For a number of years there has been an increasing emphasis on data quality in online databases [10]. In this paper we look at techniques to aid in detecting variant forms of strings in bibliographic databases. This is called authority work <ref> [2] </ref>, and results in the creation of authority files that maintain the correspondence between all of the allowable forms for strings in a particular bibliographic field, for example author or journal name. Another problem arises when bibliographic databases are integrated.

Reference-contexts: We can address this problem by constraining the allowable edit distance between two components. Damerau <ref> [3] </ref> has noted that over 80% of all spelling errors are due to one of the four simple edit operations (insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition). This has also been confirmed by Morgan [9]. So whenever e (u; v) = 1 it is almost certainly a spelling variant or misspelling.

Reference-contexts: Among other things we will have to create a list of affiliations. Since the ADS does not currently have such an author affiliation list, we will need to derive it from the data. This work is part of a larger project described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Related work in astronomical sociology is described by Schulman [11, 12]. Others have considered similar problems with variant forms in bibliographic fields, for example, author names [13] and titles [15]. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach for resolving variant forms of titles in Section 4. <p> The second step above is the topic of the present paper. A case study of a specific application of steps one through three is detailed in a companion paper <ref> [5] </ref>. The fourth step is the topic of a forthcoming paper. 3 Clustering Approach We will use examples from the ADS throughout the discussion that follows. We assume that we have extracted all of the unique strings, fs i g, together with the occurrence frequency of each string. <p> It may be necessary to perform some domain specific transformations on the strings before clustering them. In some cases this step can drastically reduce the manual effort required to resolve the final assignment of strings to standard forms. An example of this phenomenon is discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.1 Edit Distance The edit distance, e (u; v), of two strings is a measure of similarity that is given by the minimal number of simple edit operations needed to transform u into v or vice versa. <p> The following is an example of the benefit. In one of our subprocessing steps in <ref> [5] </ref>, we computed the upper triangular matrix of pairwise edit distances for an 8,380 word vocabulary. On a Sun Ultra this took 938 seconds to compute. That time was reduced to 716 seconds after applying the test above. <p> The decision as to which tokens denote words is domain dependent. For the present purposes, we use a blank as the word separator and exclude punctuation. In general, punctuation will require more care in handling. This is discussed further in <ref> [5] </ref>. Our approximate word matching approach is to find a minimum distance matching of the words in u and v. The idea is to pair up the words so that the sum of the edit distances is minimized. <p> In general, all results are acceptable but not as favorable as those for the affiliation variants. We note that for the journal title variants, the automatic preprocessing steps mentioned in Section 3 and detailed in a companion paper <ref> [5] </ref> are not as effective as they were for affiliation variants. Specifically, a number of abbreviations can not be unambiguously expanded. <p> This paper has discussed techniques for improving data quality and data access by detecting variable forms of strings and collecting them together under a standard form. This can be thought of as the semi-automatic generation of an authority file <ref> [5] </ref>. Our procedure still requires manual intervention, but after we generate authority files, we can create classifiers to reduce the burden of detecting variant forms as new data is acquired by a system. <p> We are currently applying these methods to the bibliographic data in the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library (NCSTRL)[4] databases, two real-world online databases. The methods described in this paper were used in the pilot study <ref> [5] </ref> from which the records in Figure 1 were drawn; the effect of these methods on those records is shown in Figure 3. The 21 unique affiliation variants of Figure 1 have been grouped into four clusters. <p> These are high quality clusters containing no misclassifications that are used in the second stage, manually supervised, clustering phase of our methodology. The methods are effective and efficient enough to be used in production environments. In the study reported in <ref> [5] </ref>, we extracted 20,168 unique affiliation strings from our sample of 146,000 records. We were able to reduce these to 8,928 strings by using extremely conservative thresholds. One of our goals is to automatically generate auxiliary access structures for browsing online databases.

Reference-contexts: The four simple edit operations considered here are insertion of one character, deletion of one character, substitution of one character by another, and transposing two adjacent characters. Edit distance has traditionally been used in approximate string matching <ref> [6] </ref>, spelling error detection and correction [7], and more recently has been shown to be more effective than Soundex for phonetic string matching [16].

Reference-contexts: The choice of the distance metric, d (x; y), plays a crucial role in our clustering approach.

First, as before, we find a minimal cost matching of the components in the string. Next we determine what components match sufficiently well.

These approaches are not intended for one and two-word fields such as keywords, but do appear to be well-suited to resolving variant forms of longer multiword fields. We demonstrate this on another field in the ADS bibliographic data| journal titles.
