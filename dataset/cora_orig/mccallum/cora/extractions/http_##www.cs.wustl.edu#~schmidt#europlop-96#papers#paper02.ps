Abstract: The purpose of this paper is mainly to introduce the concepts of pattern languages, frameworks and virtual machines in an educational setting. We present a pattern language for building virtual machines using a domain specific framework. The patterns are organised so that the first patterns deal with concepts in the domain of virtual machines and later patterns are more concerned with implementation details. Even though the patterns document the use of a particular framework, they are formulated general enough to serve as general guidelines (principles and abstractions) when developing simple virtual machines. A framework prototype implemented in BETA is available.

The cells can be of many kinds and there can be several domains of cells in the memory.

Solution Use the template in Figure 4 and extend it with new fragments if neccessary. 6 This is described in detail in <ref> [ Madsen et al., 1993, chapter 17 ] </ref> . 7 This is necessary in order to make the state attributes visible to the classes that operate on them. 8 figure have origin in betaenv and are bound to the slot lib:attributes.
