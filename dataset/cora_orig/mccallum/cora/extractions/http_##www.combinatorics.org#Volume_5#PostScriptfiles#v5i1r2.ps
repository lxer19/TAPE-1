Abstract: We identify a set of d! signed points, called Toeplitz points, in Z d , with the following property: for every n &gt; 0, the excess of the number of lattice walks of n steps, from the origin to all positive Toeplitz points, over the number to all negative Toeplitz points, is equal to n times the number of permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng that contain no ascending subsequence of length &gt; d. We prove this first by generating functions, using a determinantal theorem of Gessel. We give a second proof by direct construction of an appropriate involution. The latter provides a purely combinatorial proof of Gessel's theorem by interpreting it in terms of lattice walks. Finally we give a proof that uses the Schensted algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Regarding u n (d), a great deal is known. The asymptotic behavior of the sequence has been determined by Regev [6]. An explicit generating function of the sequence has been found by Gessel <ref> [1] </ref>, in the form X u n (d) n! 2 x 2n = det (I jrsj (2x)) r;s=1;:::;d : (1) in which the I -'s are the Bessel functions of imaginary argument. We will use the result (1) in section 2 to establish our correspondence with lattice walks.

Reference-contexts: 0 (2 p p x , we obtain by taking x := (n=d) 2 , the estimate u n (d) K (d)n (d=21) d 2n : If we take a little more care with the estimate, and use the fact that I 0 (2 p x) d is Hayman admissible <ref> [4] </ref>, being the dth power of an entire function of order 1=2 whose zeros are all negative and real, then we get an extra factor of n :5 in the denominator of the above estimate, which however is still not sharp.

We can also get a lower bound on the number of permutations, but this is even less sharp. The walks that correspond to these permutations are, as we have seen, encoded by certain pairs a=b.
