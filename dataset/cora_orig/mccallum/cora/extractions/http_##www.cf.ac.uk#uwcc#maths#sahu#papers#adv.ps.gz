Abstract: The self regenerative MCMC is a tool for constructing a Markov chain with a given stationary distribution by constructing an auxiliary chain with some other stationary distribution . Elements of the auxiliary chain are picked a suitable random number of times so that the resulting chain has the stationary distribution , Sahu and Zhigljavsky (1998). In this article we provide a generic adaptation scheme for the above algorithm. The adaptive scheme is to use the knowledge of the stationary distribution gathered so far and then to update during the course of the simulation. This method is easy to implement and often leads to considerable improvement. We obtain theoretical results for the adaptive scheme. Our proposed methodology is illustrated with a number of realistic examples in Bayesian computation and its performance is compared with other available MCMC techniques. In one of our applications we develop a non-linear dynamics model for modeling predator-prey relationships in the wild.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we review the SR algorithm and provide more implementation details. Section 3 provides a generic adaptation scheme for the SR. Also in this section, we obtain further theoretical results for the adaptive methodology. We give three practical 2 examples in Section 4. The popular Metropolis algorithm <ref> (Metropolis et al., 1953) </ref> does not mix well and very hard to tune in our examples. We show that our adaptive methodology works much better in general.

Reference-contexts: We assume that x t and y t follow Poisson distributions with means A t and A t respectively. Now we impose non-linear dynamical models on the log intensities as follows <ref> (see, e.g., Royama, 1996, page 194) </ref>: log ( t+1 ) = log ( t ) + ff x + log f1 exp (fi x t )g t ; Royama suggests taking ff x = log (1:86); fi x = 5; ff y = log (6:05) and fi y = 6.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Simulation techniques based on Markov chains are increasingly being popular for Monte Carlo inference under the Bayesian paradigm. Accessible discussions are found for example in Gelfand and Smith (1990), Smith and Roberts (1993), Gilks et al. (1996). The self regenerative (SR) algorithm is one such MCMC technique <ref> (Sahu and Zhigljavsky, 1998) </ref> available for Bayesian computation. These modern computing techniques enable the practicing statistician fit complex statistical models for plausible explanation of data. However, as the data sets and the models become more challenging the 1 limitations of the computation methods (e.g., slow mixing) become more transparent. <p> Also there is no need to monitor convergence diagnostics very much required for the other MCMC techniques. The SR algorithm diagnoses itself. A properly implemented SR algorithm should accept often and should not have high weights (~ n ) for particular points. As shown in this article <ref> (and in a concurrent paper, Sahu and Zhigljavsky, 1998) </ref> the SR algorithm lends itself to easily implemented adaptation. Because of the complexity of the statistical models it is perhaps not possible to start with a proposal density which is close to the target posterior density.
