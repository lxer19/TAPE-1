Abstract: When computing 3D interpretations of noisy 2D images, many interpretations are often plausible. We describe a general framework for resolving such ambiguities in object recognition and reconstruction using maximum likelihood estimation. To this end we define measures of likelihood and stability of interpretations. We use these measures to select the "best" interpretation from the set of possible interpretations in object recognition or in reconstruction tasks. These measures also give a practical way to evaluate how "generic" views are, and identify "characteristic" views for the purpose of building multi-view representations. To demonstrate the usefulness and generality of this framework, we computed the proposed stability and likelihood measures using 4 different kinds of image matching algorithms, matching: (1) feature points, (2) angles, (3) occluding contours of smooth surfaces, and (4) shaded images of smooth surfaces.

Reference-contexts: It is a bit more complicated to show that with a small error tolerance, a similarity-based algorithm, such as alignment <ref> [5] </ref>, will return the following lists: * left image =) fobject (a), object (b)g * middle image =) fobject (b), object (c)g * right image =) fobject (c), object (a)g The first object in each list matches the image exactly up to rotation and scale, and corresponds to the matching shown

Reference-contexts: Right: the image of the most likely object, super-imposed on the original vertices. Clearly, both interpretations match the data reasonably well. 1 A model-to-image metric measures the distance between the closest view of a 3D model to the given 2D image, up to some 2D image transformation <ref> [9] </ref>. 2. We estimate an upper bound on the noise in the image to be 4 times the 3D-affine distance between the model and the image 2 .

Reference-contexts: Using these measures in the example of Fig. 1, the interpretations preferred by humans (shown with thin black arrows in Fig. 1) are by far the best (our measure of robustness is at least twice as high for each of these interpretations).

This scheme differs from ours in two important ways: First, it is Bayesian (thus requiring prior distributions) whereas our scheme is based on maximum likelihood.
