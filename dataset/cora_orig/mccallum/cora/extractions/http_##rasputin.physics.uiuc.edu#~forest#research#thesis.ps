Reference-contexts: These tori are produced by the joint action of the repulsive core and tensor interactions. In contrast the equidensity shapes in the 1 M =1 states have dumbbell shapes, which have been studied earlier <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Most realistic models of v ij contain these components and, for example, the Reid [3], Paris [4], Urbana [5] and new Argonne v 18 [6] models seem to predict similar structures. The dimensions of the toroidal distribution are related to the observed electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron. <p> This gives 0 d (=0; r 0 ) = 1 d (==2; r 0 ) which is not true. The dumbbell- or cigar-shaped density distribution of the deuteron in the M d =1 state has been studied earlier <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Unfortunately the toroidal distribution of the M d =0 state was not studied, and its similarity with the predictions of Skyrmion field theory was not noticed.

It is the only two-nucleon bound state and has isospin T =0 and total angular momentum J =1. Deuteron was traditionally pictured as dumbbell- or cigar-shaped <ref> [2] </ref>. Recently we have discovered that it also has a toroidal shape [7] of femtometer size which may be regarded as more fundamental than the dumbbell shape, since the dumbbell shape is generated by rotating tori. These interesting short-range structures can be easily understood from the underlying nuclear two-body interactions. <p> This gives 0 d (=0; r 0 ) = 1 d (==2; r 0 ) which is not true.

Most realistic models of v ij contain these components and, for example, the Reid [3], Paris [4], Urbana [5] and new Argonne v 18 <ref> [6] </ref> models seem to predict similar structures. The dimensions of the toroidal distribution are related to the observed electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron. The structures are rather dense and small. <p> Some of the results obtained by Pudliner et al. [12, 13] are listed in Table 1.1. The Argonne v 18 2-body potential <ref> [6] </ref> and Urbana IX 3-body potential [12, 13] used in this work are constrained to give the correct binding energies for 2 H and 3 H. <p> Among these models are Reid [3], Paris [4], Urbana [5], and new Ar-gonne v 18 <ref> [6] </ref>. The two-body interaction described by these models has common features such as short-range repulsion, intermediate-range attraction and long-range OPEP. <p> The static part of v ij containing the first six terms of Eq. (2.6) dominates, however, the non-static part is not negligible and gives rise to spin-orbit splitting in nuclei. In addition to the above isoscalar 14 terms, accurate models <ref> [6, 26] </ref> of v ij also contain small isovector and isotensor terms which describe the breaking of isospin symmetry. They will not be considered here for brevity. 2.2 The Deuteron Deuteron is the simplest nucleus with one proton and one neutron. <p> Figure 2.1 shows the expectation value of v stat 0;1 (r) in the M S =0 state for =0 and ==2 calculated from Reid [3], Paris [4], Urbana [5] and Argonne v 18 <ref> [6] </ref> models of N N interaction. The static potential has a repulsive core; outside the core it is very attractive for ==2 and repulsive for =0 and . <p> for two-nucleon system in its center of mass frame is chosen as: H R = 2 p 2 + m 2 2m + p m m 2 + p 2 + ~v R : (4.7) where ~v R has the same form as the isoscalar part of Argonne v 18 <ref> [6] </ref> (Eq. 2.6-2.7). The ~v ;NR used in Argonne v 18 is given by Eq. (2.2). We note that this ~v ;NR does not contain the part of i j t i t j interaction which acquires a ffi (r ij ) function form in the limit of point particles. <p> The parameters I, P , Q and R are further constrained by the following conditions: P t Q ST = W (0) P i @W + ffi ic ST # ; (4.11) ST = 0 for S = 0 states based on physical arguments <ref> [6] </ref>. The free parameters for Argonne v 18 were obtained by fitting directly to the Nijmegen pp, np scattering database, low-energy nn scattering parameters and deuteron binding energy, and they are listed in Table 4.1. Traditionally phase shifts are calculated in configuration space.

Reference-contexts: The structures are rather dense and small. Current models predict the maximum one-body density of the torus inside the deuteron to be ~ 0:34 0:02 fm 3 , i.e., approximately twice nuclear matter density, and it has a radius of ~0.5 fm <ref> [7] </ref>. Similar structures are also found in other nuclei such as 3;4 He, 6;7 Li, 16 O and symmetric nuclear matter. <p> It is the only two-nucleon bound state and has isospin T =0 and total angular momentum J =1. Deuteron was traditionally pictured as dumbbell- or cigar-shaped [2]. Recently we have discovered that it also has a toroidal shape <ref> [7] </ref> of femtometer size which may be regarded as more fundamental than the dumbbell shape, since the dumbbell shape is generated by rotating tori.

Wiringa <ref> [11] </ref> has shown that the nonrelativistic correlation functions for 2 H, 3 H and 4 He are almost the same at small r. Therefore we use the ~'s for 3 S 1 3 D 1 from those in the deuteron. <p> Many terms in Eq. (5.1) can be calculated straightforwardly with Monte Carlo methods discussed in many references <ref> [11, 20, 21, 54] </ref>. The terms that require some mathematical considerations are the nonlocal terms, i.e., h p m 2 + p 2 i in the relativistic kinetic energy and ~v ;Rel (Eq. 4.4) in the two-body potential.

The resulting value of A 2 is very close to that of the Fujita-Miyazawa value. The three-nucleon interaction is much weaker than the two-nucleon interaction, however, it enhances the tensor correlations slightly and therefore cannot be treated as a first-order perturbation in accurate calculations. <p> The toroidal structure is presumably very sensitive to this coupling and to the tensor part of the quark-quark interaction in the framework of the constituent quark model.

The toroidal structure of the deuteron is expected to be reproduced. Such a calculation is in progress.

(3.27) for ffiv (P) were obtained using classical considerations in <ref> [20] </ref>. In relativistic classical mechanics two particles at rest a distance r 0 apart have energy E 0 = 2m + ~v (r 0 ) (3.28) in their rest frame by definition of ~v. <p> The contribution of the ffiv (P) term containing 1 q 2 q, to the binding energy of 3 H and 4 He is calculated in Ref. <ref> [20] </ref>, and those of the rest of the terms of ffiv in [21]. However the p 2 =m 2 term in ~v has been neglected in Ref. [20] and almost all other models of v NN except the Bonn and Nijmegen boson exchange models. <p> the ffiv (P) term containing 1 q 2 q, to the binding energy of 3 H and 4 He is calculated in Ref. <ref> [20] </ref>, and those of the rest of the terms of ffiv in [21]. However the p 2 =m 2 term in ~v has been neglected in Ref. [20] and almost all other models of v NN except the Bonn and Nijmegen boson exchange models. <p> Many terms in Eq. (5.1) can be calculated straightforwardly with Monte Carlo methods discussed in many references <ref> [11, 20, 21, 54] </ref>. The terms that require some mathematical considerations are the nonlocal terms, i.e., h p m 2 + p 2 i in the relativistic kinetic energy and ~v ;Rel (Eq. 4.4) in the two-body potential. <p> The expectation value of the square-root kinetic energy operator can be evaluated in the following way, as suggested by Carlson et al. <ref> [20] </ref>.

In addition, the use of short-range phenomenological terms in the interaction gives the flexibility to allow a very good fit to the two-body scattering data with 2 ~ 1. <p> These terms are respectively denoted by ffiv RE (P; r) and ffiv LC (P; r) in Ref. <ref> [21] </ref>. When the interacting particles are spinless (3.32) gives their entire ffiv (P). When the interacting particles have spin the last term of (3.27) is generated by Thomas precession [47]. <p> These do not have analogues in classical mechanics, and some of them are discussed in section 3.5 in the context of the one-pion-exchange interaction. They are denoted by ffiv QM (P; r) in Ref. <ref> [21] </ref>. The contribution of ffiv T P (P; r) to the binding energy of 3 H and 4 He has been found to be rather small, and that of ffiv QM (P; r) is even smaller. <p> For example, the contributions of ffiv RE , ffiv LC , ffiv T P and and ffiv QM to the energy of triton are found to be 0.23 (2), 0.10 (1), 0.016 (2) and -0.004 (2) MeV, respectively, in Ref. <ref> [21] </ref>. 3.3 Meson-Exchange Potentials In this section, we will discuss one-meson exchange interaction using the Feynman diagram approach. By using Feynman rules we may calculate the transition matrix T fi , which in turn will give us the potentials in momentum space. <p> The contribution of the ffiv (P) term containing 1 q 2 q, to the binding energy of 3 H and 4 He is calculated in Ref.

Eq. (3.23) can be used to determine ffiv (P) from the ~v, and Friar <ref> [23] </ref> found a simple first-order solution ffiv (P) = P 2 1 1 It is sufficient to use the ~v of order 1=m in Eq. (3.26) to obtain ffiv (P) up to order 1=m 3 . <p> The boost operator K I can have additional terms, denoted by w in <ref> [19, 23] </ref>, which commute with P. These make unitary transformations of the relativistic Hamiltonian, and can be chosen for convenience. The present choice, w = 0, is motivated by the desire to maintain correspondence with classical relativistic mechanics via Eq. (3.27), and is suitable to study energies of nuclear states.

Reference-contexts: The static part of v ij containing the first six terms of Eq. (2.6) dominates, however, the non-static part is not negligible and gives rise to spin-orbit splitting in nuclei. In addition to the above isoscalar 14 terms, accurate models <ref> [6, 26] </ref> of v ij also contain small isovector and isotensor terms which describe the breaking of isospin symmetry. They will not be considered here for brevity. 2.2 The Deuteron Deuteron is the simplest nucleus with one proton and one neutron. <p> particular the anisotropies of the ~ d~p, ~ d ~ d, and ff ~ d distributions in 3 He, 4 He and 6 Li are strongly influenced by the toroidal structure of the deuteron. 2.3 The Three-Nucleon Interaction The binding energy of 3 H calculated from realistic two-nucleon interactions alone <ref> [26] </ref> is typically 7.6 MeV against the observed value of 8.48 MeV. The equilibrium density of nuclear matter predicted by Hamiltonians containing only two-nucleon interactions is too large [44]. Therefore it is necessary to add at least three-nucleon interactions to the nuclear Hamiltonian to obtain agreement with experiment. <p> Since both H NR and H R are constrained to give the same deuteron binding energy, the changes in hT i and h~v ij i cancel exactly in 2 H. In 3 H and 4 He they largely cancel to give a rather small net effect. Friar et al. <ref> [26] </ref> have studied the triton energy with local and nonlocal versions of the Nijmegen potential. In the latter case the nonlocality is also present in the short range part of the potential and it gives ~0.1 MeV more binding than the local.

Reference-contexts: The R 0 and R 2 calculated from the different potential models are shown in Fig. 2.3. The short-range structures are related to the R 0 and R 2 functions, and therefore we expect them to be fairly model-independent. However, the "full" Bonn potential <ref> [27] </ref> offers an exception. The R 0 and R 2 predicted by this one-boson-exchange model of the N N interaction are similar to other predictions at larger r, but they have an additional sharp structure with a range of ~0.2 fm.

Reference-contexts: In the classical Skyrmion field theory only this shape is obtained for the distribution of baryon density in the ground state for two baryons <ref> [28] </ref>. The deuteron can be considered to be more deformed in the M d =0 state. <p> The toroidal structure of the deuteron is expected to be reproduced. Such a calculation is in progress. It is interesting to note that toroidal structure for the ground state of the deuteron was predicted by classical Skyrme field theory <ref> [28] </ref>, related to QCD in the limit of infinite colors. In the classical limit one obtains a toroidal shape of ~ 1 fm in size and a binding energy of ~ 150 MeV.

Reference-contexts: Their normalizations give a contribution of v 0 X (q)P 2 =8m 2 to the ffiv X . Only this contribution is considered in the earlier work by Hajduk and Sauer <ref> [49] </ref>, and it accounts for half of the P 2 =4m 2 term in Eq. (3.51). The other half of the P 2 =4m 2 term, and the last term in ffiv X have different origins in the field theories for scalar and vector meson exchange.

Reference-contexts: The H R given by (3.66) being valid only up to order 1=m 2 can not yield the rest of terms, of order 1=m 3 or higher, in Eq. (3.65). The first term in the fourth row, of order 1=m 3 , is known <ref> [50] </ref> to be the Hartree con tribution of the three-body force V ijk , shown in Fig. 3.2. It is obtained by eliminating the antiparticle degrees of freedom from H R .

Reference-contexts: Traditionally phase shifts are calculated in configuration space. However, in the rela tivistic case, the Hamiltonian contains p m 2 r 2 which is nonlocal in configuration space, therefore the momentum-space technique <ref> [51] </ref> will be used.

Reference-contexts: Note that even though we only study 3 H and 4 He in this work, the techniques developed here are very general and will be applied to A = 6 8 nuclei. 5.1 VMC Method The Monte Carlo method <ref> [52] </ref> offers a useful way to handle the multidimensional integrals which would otherwise be impractical by the usual numerical methods. <p> There are various techniques for sampling w (R) <ref> [52] </ref>, and in this work Metropolis sampling method [53] is used to treat the complicated distributions. 62 Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) technique is based on variational principle that the minimum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is closest to the ground state energy of the system.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5.1 shows an example of the two-body correlations for 3 H. For A 3 nuclei such as 3 H and 4 He, the three-body force is not negligible and it induces three-body correlations in the wave function. A good representation of three-body correlations is given in Ref. <ref> [54] </ref>. <p> The parameters q c 1 , q c 1 , q ls 3 , * and b in the above three-body correlations are treated as additional variational parameters. They are listed in Ref. <ref> [54] </ref> and are used in this work. 5.3 Relativistic Wave Functions Relativistic wave function can be expressed in a similar fashion as the nonrelativistic wave function (Eq. 5.26), but the two-body correlation functions should be determined from rela tivistic Schrodinger-like f-equations. <p> Many terms in Eq. (5.1) can be calculated straightforwardly with Monte Carlo methods discussed in many references <ref> [11, 20, 21, 54] </ref>. The terms that require some mathematical considerations are the nonlocal terms, i.e., h p m 2 + p 2 i in the relativistic kinetic energy and ~v ;Rel (Eq. 4.4) in the two-body potential.

Reference-contexts: Friar et al. [26] have studied the triton energy with local and nonlocal versions of the Nijmegen potential. In the latter case the nonlocality is also present in the short range part of the potential and it gives ~0.1 MeV more binding than the local. Machleidt et al. <ref> [55] </ref> obtained 8.00 MeV of the triton binding with the CD Bonn nonlocal potential; in this case the nonlocality is much larger, ~ -0.4 MeV. More studies need to be done in the future.

Reference-contexts: Due to the small size of this toroidal structure it may be worthwhile to attempt to understand it from the more basic quark degrees of freedom. Within the constituent quark model <ref> [56, 57] </ref> it requires a solution of the six-quark problem with a suitably chosen Hamil-tonian. Many attempts have been made (see Ref.

Reference-contexts: The Urbana models have the oversimplified form for V R ijk (Eq. 2.45). In principle, V R ijk should contain rich structures of spin and isospin dependence and spin-orbital interaction like in the two-body potential. Recently Coon, Pena and Riska <ref> [59] </ref> suggested that the three-nucleon interaction could arise from -scalar and -vector meson exchange. It was motivated by a recent experiment [60] on pp ! pp 0 near threshold performed at Indiana University. <p> The off-shell + N ! N +scalar and + N !

Reference-contexts: One of the (1 + jVj 2 =4) factors compensates for the change in normalization due to the Lorentz contraction, while the other represents the covariant normalization (E=E (P = 0)) of the boosted wave function <ref> [61] </ref>. Relativistic effects have many aspects, only a portion has been studied in this work. As our knowledge of nuclear interactions improves, new effects may be discovered.
