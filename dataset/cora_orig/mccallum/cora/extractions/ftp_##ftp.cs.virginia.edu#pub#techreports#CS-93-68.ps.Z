Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of primer selection in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. We prove that the problem of minimizing the number of primers required to amplify a set of DNA sequences is N P-complete. Moreover, we show that it is also intractable to approximate solutions to this problem to within a constant times optimal. On the practical side, we give a simple branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the primers minimization problem within reasonable time for typical instances. Moreover, we present an efficient approximation scheme for this problem, and prove that our heuristic always produces solutions with cost no worse than a logarithmic factor times optimal. Finally, we analyze a weighted variant, where both the number of primers as well as the sum of their "costs" is optimized simultaneously. We conclude by addressing the empirical performance of our methods on biological data.

Thus, the extension of the unweighted approximation algorithm to a weighted approximation algorithm is also quite straightforward.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the practice of molecular biology, making it routine to synthesize millions of copies of a single gene or other portion of a genome (for a recent review, see <ref> [5] </ref>). PCR has been used to synthesize nanogram quantities of a gene from a single sperm (and thus a single DNA molecule), a 10 14 -fold amplification [1].

Reference-contexts: If this transformation can be achieved "efficiently", then the problem at hand is intractable also. Indeed this is a fundamental technique in the theory of N P-completeness <ref> [6] </ref>, which defines and characterizes the class N P of problems that are solvable in non-deterministic polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Large families of related genes have become surprisingly common over the past 5 years. Currently the largest known family is believed to contain as many as 1000 related genes that encode proteins called G-protein-coupled receptors <ref> [7] </ref>. However, there are many other such families that encode a large range of proteins with essential roles; PCR amplification is often the only technically feasible method for characterizing members of such large families of genes. Here the problem is quite different from the typical primer selection problem. <p> We also implemented the scheme mentioned in Section 6 that simultaneously minimizes both cardinality and weight. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms on biological data consisting of 56 DNA sequences, each 75 nucleotides long, from one of the transmembrane domains (TM3) from 56 G-protein coupled receptors <ref> [7] </ref>; the data itself is shown in Figure 8. We have also created 30 random permutations of the codons (i.e., 3-base triplet substrings) of each sequence of the data, and tested our method on all of the resulting instances.

Reference-contexts: Our transformation in the previous section of an arbitrary instance of OPC into an instance of MSC suggests that in our search for an efficient heuristic for the OPC problem, it suffices to address the MSC problem. Lund and Yannakakis <ref> [13] </ref> showed that no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate solutions to MSC within less than 1 4 log e jT j times optimal, unless a longstanding open problem in complexity theory is resolved in the negative, an unlikely situation. <p> Select an M i 2 M maximizing jM i " U j 5.
