Reference-contexts: Many artists have developed theories of colour, including <ref> (Albers, 1971) </ref>, Gerritsen (see Section 2.2.6), (Itten, 1961), (Munsell, 1947) and many others. For a good introduction to such theories, see (Hope and Walch, 1990) and (Norman, 1990).

Reference-contexts: on black text. 6 The luminance of a colour can be measured using a photometer, for example. 7 The reading threshold refers to the minimum level at which reading is possible. 8 visual angle is the angle formed at the eye by rays from the extremities of an object viewed <ref> (Allen, 1990) </ref> 28 Chapter 2. Background In section 2.6, several issues are discussed which relate to the way colours are perceived. Many things that can change the appearance of a colour, such as lighting and vision problems, are considered. <p> Similarly, the perceived saturation of the colours will be decreased by strong veiling lights, reducing chromatic contrast. Adaptation presents another interesting problem because the threshold level for contrast is dependent on the largest contrast presented to the reader. 2.8 Colour Harmony According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary <ref> (Allen, 1990) </ref>, harmony is defined as an apt or aesthetic arrangement of parts ... the pleasing effect of this. Unfortunately, defining harmonies, particularly colour harmonies, is not simple.

Reference-contexts: that can be expected when subjects are actively trained to identify colours, much less can be expected of the average untrained person, perhaps as few as 100-150 distinct colours. 2.6 Basic Colour Terms and Colour Discrimination The linguistic concept of basic colour terms were introduced by anthropologists Berlin and Kay <ref> (Berlin and Kay, 1969) </ref>. It has been suggested, based on their work, that there may be only 11 categories of basic colour sensations, each associated with a well-learned name and possibly a unique physiological substrate. <p> There is no simple definition of what constitutes a basic colour term. Intuitively, they are words such as black, white, and green but not expressions such as crimson, scarlet, blond, blue-green, bluish, lemon-coloured, salmon-coloured, and the colour of the air pipes in the Davis Centre. Berlin and Kay <ref> (Berlin and Kay, 1969) </ref> proposed that the basic colour terms are similar across all languages. This proposal contradicted the prevailing doctrine of American linguists and anthropologists, which held that each language performs the linguistic coding of life experiences in a unique manner.

Reference-contexts: There are theories explaining many aspects of 1.3. Tools for Aesthetic Colour Selection 3 colour perception and colour theory, but no comprehensive model of human colour vision exists and explanations of some perceptual phenomena elude researchers <ref> (Boynton, 1979) </ref>. Another aspect of the problem is that all of the different fields that study some aspect of colour, from graphic design to physics, use different techniques and terminology. Chapter 2 explains the aspects of some of these areas that are relevant to this thesis. <p> For an in-depth look at colour vision, see <ref> (Boynton, 1979) </ref>. Some things are known about colour vision: for example, it is believed that the colour information in the visual system is processed in parallel and independently of other aspects of vision (Cowan and Ware, 1985).

Reference-contexts: To see how a more abstract specification for red can be formulated, recall Boynton's study of basic colour terms discussed in Section 2.6. Boynton and Olson identified sets of colours in the OSA colour space that correspond to the basic colours <ref> (Boynton and Olson, 1987) </ref>. Using this data, a constraint that restricts a colour value to red could easily be constructed by restricting the colour to a colour value that is in Boynton and Olson's set of red colours. <p> The actual colour value used for operand two is one of the mean centroid values found by Boynton and Olson <ref> (Boynton and Olson, 1987) </ref>, shown in Table 6.2. Windows with the same name are defined to be similar, those with different names are defined to be different. Therefore, all windows with the same name are assigned the same basic colour.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested, based on their work, that there may be only 11 categories of basic colour sensations, each associated with a well-learned name and possibly a unique physiological substrate. Basic colour terms provide faster and more reliable colour naming than other terms, with greater agreement amount viewers. <ref> (Smallman and Boynton, 1990) </ref>. Colour naming is important because colours on a display will often need to be cross referenced, as in the red window or the green window with blue text. <p> Background Basic Colour Mean Interpoint OSA Distance Yellow 13.84 White 13.01 Orange 12.73 Blue 12.14 Green 11.59 Pink 11.37 Purple 11.34 Black 11.30 Red 11.04 Brown 9.47 Table 2.3: Mean Interpoint Distance in the OSA Uniform Colour Space is OSA Units between Each Optimal Basic Colour and All Others <ref> (Smallman and Boynton, 1990) </ref> one extreme case, efficient colour coding can take place with 14 colours as long as they are well separated in the OSA space. However, the use of basic colours is still advantageous because the ease of attaching universal names to the colours for cross referencing.

Reference-contexts: Objective colour specification, independent of any display medium, is provided by the branch of physics known as colorimetry. Many of these models are based on colour models developed long ago by artists and scientists such as <ref> (Chevreul, 1967) </ref>, (Munsell, 1947) and (Ostwald, 1931). In the following sections, several models will be described. For a more complete history of colour models, see (Norman, 1990) or (Gerritsen, 1988).

Reference-contexts: The ACE system is the one notable exception (Meier, 1988). Other systems that automatically select colour, such as <ref> (Corte, 1986) </ref> and (Grosse, 1985), consider only a small subset of the problem and are applicable to a limited domain of colour usage. <p> For example, an application could request a background colour and any number of foreground colours for use with it. The techniques used for the generation of distinguishable window colours, as well as research such as <ref> (Corte, 1986) </ref> and (Grosse, 1985), would provide a basis for this functionality. By giving applications the ability to specify the foreground/background relationship between any pair of colours, the implementation would be straightforward. Additional constraints for to assist with aesthetic colour selection should be developed.

Reference-contexts: For example, use of the system has shown that very different window styles can create visually unrelated windows with quite similar colours. Improving techniques for window organization is important, as recent experiments <ref> (Cowan, Jolicoeur and Loop, 1991) </ref> show convincingly that colour is far superior to any other aspect of computer windows for context resolution. Furthermore, use of the window system has suggested a need for more specialized constraints.

Reference-contexts: If the black level of the monitor cannot be measured at typical light levels, a reasonable default is to use 1% of the maximum white level, as is the case with both of the monitors in Table 4.1 when the controls are adjusted for the typical lighting conditions <ref> (Cowan, 1989) </ref>. The black level of the monitor represents the minimum luminance that can be produced on the monitor. To account for this, the black level should be added to the calculated luminances of the colours before the contrast is calculated.

Reference-contexts: The question of how pigments combine requires knowledge of how pigments are suspended in the medium and how light is scattered within the medium. For a more detailed discussion of this, see <ref> (Cowan and Ware, 1985) </ref>. Complementary Colours With both additive and subtractive colour mixing, each pure colour has associated with it another colour, call its complement. Mixing a colour with an equal amount of its complement results in grey. <p> For an in-depth look at colour vision, see (Boynton, 1979). Some things are known about colour vision: for example, it is believed that the colour information in the visual system is processed in parallel and independently of other aspects of vision <ref> (Cowan and Ware, 1985) </ref>. Also, the sensation of colour hue is very complicated, being far more than just a perception of the dominant wavelength of the light entering the eye. Josef Albers (1971) shows how simple it is to create visual illusions such as making two colours appear as one. <p> It is well known that adaptation in the human visual system causes sensitivity to luminance contrast to scale relative to the range of the luminances of all objects in the visual field, dulling sensitivity to small contrasts when large contrasts are present <ref> (Cowan and Ware, 1985) </ref>. Does a similar effect hold for chromatic contrast? If so, similar colours can be easily differentiated as long as there are no radically different colours present in the visual field.

Reference-contexts: In the following sections several topics are discussed in sufficient depth to understand the thesis. For each topic, references are provided for further reading. Knowledge of computer science and a basic knowledge of computer graphics are assumed. For an introduction to computer graphics, see <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that a dynamic window system is a feasible approach to assisting users with the selection and maintenance of window colours. Colour science bridges many disciplines, including computer science, physics, physiology, psychology, art and graphic design. <p> More commonly, the phosphors can be illuminated at 256 different intensities, giving over sixteen million possible combinations. A more in-depth description of the workings of a CRT, as well as other display devices, may be found is books such as <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. <p> For simplicity, the internal workings of the CRT are ignored and only the relationships between the voltage and the light output for a given phosphor are considered 1 . The relationship is I = kV ; or V = (I=k) (2:1) for constants k and fl. <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref> describes how to actually calculate the value of required voltage V for a desired intensity I. For a typical CRT, the value of fl falls in the range 2.2 to 2.5. <p> Extending this, any additive combination of three colours I, J and K lies in the triangle IJ K. This area, called a colour gamut, represents all the colours that can be additively produced using I, J and K as colour primaries <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. Colour gamuts are actually three dimensional since the verticies are defined using XYZ coordinates, but are more conveniently represented on the two-dimensional chromaticity diagram. <p> Statements such as Any decorative use of colour should be subservient to the functional use and In general, it is good to minimize the number of different colours being used are common in guidelines for user-interface design <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. The purpose of such guidelines is to avoid garish displays and unintentional user associations. Consider the implications of allowing users to choose the foreground and background colours for their windows.

Reference-contexts: As far as I am concerned, one thing is certain: it imparts a surprisingly novel experience of color and could not be more stimulating to the artist <ref> (Gerstner, 1986) </ref>. 2.4 Artistic Colour Use To create a window system that assists with aesthetic colour selection, it is useful to consider the techniques used by artists to select harmonious colour.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it is often desirable to specify colour using a display independent model such as the XYZ model. 16 Chapter 2. Background The conversion between RGB and XYZ can be expressed as follows <ref> (Hall, 1988, Eq 3.2) </ref> red phosphor: r x ; r y ; r z = 1 r x r y green phosphor: g x ; g y ; g z = 1 g x g y blue phosphor: b x ; b y ; b z = 1 b x b <p> For more information on generating this matrix, see <ref> (Hall, 1988) </ref>. <p> the Y values (which is proportional to the perceived brightness of the colours) shows that they are far from uniformly bright, yet they all have a value of 1. 4 The chromaticity coordinates of the monitor primaries and white point are those of a typical colour CRT, as suggested in <ref> (Hall, 1988) </ref>. 20 Chapter 2.

Reference-contexts: This is a colour that most people have seen many times. Yet a typical observer, given a group of similar reds, one of which is the red used on stop signs, would most likely not be able to identify it. Helson et al <ref> (Helson, Judd and Warren, 1952) </ref> studied object colour changes under different lighting conditions. In the course of their study, they trained subjects to identify colours in the Munsell colour space. Even after training, their subjects were not able to exactly identify the Munsell name of a sample colour.

Reference-contexts: For a more in depth discussion of the colour models described below, see one of (Foley et al., 1990; Rogers, 1985; Hall, 1988; Boynton, 1979). In addition, many of the concepts discussed in this section are treated at an introductory level in <ref> (Hope and Walch, 1990) </ref>. 2.2.1 Colour Mixing From the psychophysical point of view, colour can be defined as (Wyszecki and Stiles, 1982) that characteristic of a visible [colour stimulus] : : : by which an observer may distinguish differences between two structure-free fields of view of the same size and shape, <p> Many artists have developed theories of colour, including (Albers, 1971), Gerritsen (see Section 2.2.6), (Itten, 1961), (Munsell, 1947) and many others. For a good introduction to such theories, see <ref> (Hope and Walch, 1990) </ref> and (Norman, 1990). Recently, artist Stephan Quiller has taken the standard colour circle, familiar to all artists, and developed a detailed colour model for use by artists (Quiller, 1989). It is based on the subtractive colour circle that all 2.4. <p> Josef Albers (1971) shows how simple it is to create visual illusions such as making two colours appear as one. Other visual illusions, such as creating impressions of transparency and depth with colour, are discussed by Albers and in <ref> (Hope and Walch, 1990) </ref>. Many of the effects discussed by Albers are the result of simultaneous contrast, an effect where colour differences are increased at edges. Other aspects of colour perception, such as successive contrast, colour blindness and chromatic aberration, also affect the appearance of colours. <p> In both of these examples, the actual colour values being used are important only in their relation to the other colours in the paintings; as such, they represent relative colour use <ref> (Hope and Walch, 1990) </ref>. Obviously, there are cases when the dividing line between absolute and relative colour is not clear. A particular shade of red may be chosen both to represent danger and to provide enough contrast with another colour to allow text to be read.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Color is life; for a world without colors appears to us as dead. <ref> (Itten, 1961) </ref> With knowledge, an artist can take three or four unusual colors and come out with beautiful expression. It is important to study structured color schemes simply to develop this knowledge and to learn some sure-fire ways of developing beautiful color schemes and color harmony. <p> Many artists have developed theories of colour, including (Albers, 1971), Gerritsen (see Section 2.2.6), <ref> (Itten, 1961) </ref>, (Munsell, 1947) and many others.

While individual monitors may not be worth measuring an optimal value is calculable and we can assume that all well adjusted monitors have this value. Klassen suggests that a value of =a = :51 :01 is optimal, where a is the distance between pixel centers.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, a reasonable measure for equivalent chromatic contrast is not quite as straightforward. While measuring the distance between two colours is possible in a uniform colour space, it is not obvious how to measure contrast using these distances. Legge <ref> (Legge et al., 1990) </ref>, for example, measured chromatic contrast by looking at the wavelengths of light seen by the long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive cones in the eye.

Reference-contexts: Wyszecki's uniform colour space, which is in turn derived from the Munsell space (Wyszecki, 1954), and is chosen so that the system of colour sampling ... provides the maximum number and variety of [one and two dimensional] uniform colour scales and exhibits the maximum possible variety of relationships among colours <ref> (MacAdam, 1974) </ref>. The colour difference information for the space was experimentally derived by having subjects judge pairs of 59 sample tiles for colour difference. The data for the subjects was analyzed and a mathematical model was derived that best fit this data. <p> The committee hoped that because of the striking and unusual colour relationships displayed in its various colours scales, artists and designers [would] find it useful in devising new and beautiful arrangements of colors <ref> (MacAdam, 1974) </ref>. In fact, that has happened. Artist Karl Gerstner, for example, has made use of this system in his art and states Whether the uniform color space is the final model of colorimetrics, sought by so many generations of scientists, can be determined only by future research.

Reference-contexts: Many of 1 2 Chapter 1. Introduction these topics have been examined in depth and rules were developed to guide the application designer in deciding when and when not to use colour. Meier presents a detailed summary of much of this work <ref> (Meier, 1987) </ref>. Some decisions about the use of colour are hidden from the user. Whether related visual elements in an interface are colour coded is usually decided by the application designer. <p> A common mistake in window systems is to accidentally type into the wrong window. However, colour has been experimentally determined to be more useful than size, shape or brightness when searching for and identifying items that vary in only one of these aspects. Additionally, colour associations are remembered longer <ref> (Meier, 1987) </ref>. When two terminal windows differing only in colour are serving different functions, colour serves as an excellent way to distinguish the two. For some people, the most exciting ability that colour provides is the ability to personalize their environment. <p> In addition, tools provided to the user for colour selection typically concentrate on allowing the user to select a single colour, ignoring how it will be used. Therefore these tools do not provide the user with any help in selecting attractive and effective combinations of colours <ref> (Meier, 1987) </ref>. With no knowledge of the various aspects of colour theory, users can do damage as well as good to their working environment, and may have no idea what is causing the problems or how to solve them. <p> Meier presents a good summary of this work <ref> (Meier, 1987) </ref>. This thesis is not trying to extend or duplicate this research. While there exist many guidelines and heuristics for effective use of colour, it is virtually impossible to implement these heuristics using current window systems. <p> A window style is designed which, given a single colour, generates the remaining window colours using a simple and bland colour scheme. A good colour scheme for this purpose is the monochromatic colour scheme discussed in Section 5.4.2. By using standard design principles, such as those summarized in <ref> (Meier, 1987) </ref>, a window style such as the following could be created (the specifications in this example use the HLS colour space as suggested in Section 5.4.2): * border colour. Any hue, a saturation of 25%, a lightness of 50%. * border text.

Reference-contexts: Objective colour specification, independent of any display medium, is provided by the branch of physics known as colorimetry. Many of these models are based on colour models developed long ago by artists and scientists such as (Chevreul, 1967), <ref> (Munsell, 1947) </ref> and (Ostwald, 1931). In the following sections, several models will be described. For a more complete history of colour models, see (Norman, 1990) or (Gerritsen, 1988). <p> Technically, brightness is the intensity of a light source or other self-luminous object, such as a CRT. Lightness is the perceived intensity of a reflective object. Value is a carefully calibrated uniform lightness scale used in the Munsell colour system <ref> (Munsell, 1947) </ref>. While these terms are used in colour models such as HLS, HSV or HSB, the reader should be aware that they are used in these systems to represent fairly arbitrary measures of colour luminance and should not be confused with the technical meanings of these terms. <p> Many artists have developed theories of colour, including (Albers, 1971), Gerritsen (see Section 2.2.6), (Itten, 1961), <ref> (Munsell, 1947) </ref> and many others. For a good introduction to such theories, see (Hope and Walch, 1990) and (Norman, 1990). Recently, artist Stephan Quiller has taken the standard colour circle, familiar to all artists, and developed a detailed colour model for use by artists (Quiller, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Tiled window systems are based on the assumption that opened windows should not overlap, and automatically rearrange the windows to enforce this. Whether this is desirable behaviour is a matter of personal taste. A more powerful system is Stack Windows <ref> (Png, 1991) </ref>, which allows windows to be hierarchically grouped into common areas called stacks. Stacks are windows which contain other windows and have tiling behaviour enforced within them. Repositioning of windows within the stack is automatic when windows are opened or closed.

Reference-contexts: Painting is like any other art form: Just as in dance, music, or writing, once one has a thorough understanding of all the basics of the art, the rules can be adjusted and expression becomes subjective. <ref> (Quiller, 1989) </ref> Until very recently, high resolution colour displays were reserved for the elite few whose work justified the expense. This has all changed. Megapixel displays, capable of displaying 256 or more simultaneous colours chosen from a palette of over 16 million colours, are becoming inexpensive and therefore more common. <p> For a good introduction to such theories, see (Hope and Walch, 1990) and (Norman, 1990). Recently, artist Stephan Quiller has taken the standard colour circle, familiar to all artists, and developed a detailed colour model for use by artists <ref> (Quiller, 1989) </ref>. It is based on the subtractive colour circle that all 2.4. Artistic Colour Use 23 art students learn; the primaries are red, yellow and blue, the secondaries are green, violet and orange. <p> While it is hard to create visually stunning effects with this scheme, the results are usually pleasant, if somewhat bland. The Complementary Colour Scheme Complementary colours are located opposite each other on the colour wheel (or hue circle.) When true complements are mixed together, they produce beautiful neutral colours <ref> (Quiller, 1989, p.38) </ref>. When mixed in correct proportions, they produce a neutral grey. The complementary colour scheme, therefore, consists of a colour, its complement and all the semi-neutral colours created with them.

Reference-contexts: More complicated and powerful techniques are possible, of course. For example, user preferences could be used to create a neural network that picks colour sets similar to the ones the user expressed a preference for <ref> (Salomon and Chen, 1989) </ref>. One of the criticisms of using neural nets to select colours is that they always generate sets of colours similar to the seed sets. In this case, however, that is exactly what is desired. Modification of Window Styles. <p> A simple way of handling this is to occasionally create some windows based on past user choices and to create others without regard for those choices. An exciting possibility for creating windows based on past user choices is found in <ref> (Salomon and Chen, 1989) </ref>, where neural nets were used to generate colour sets. The generated sets have the property that they are quite similar to the seed set, which is exactly what is required here.

Reference-contexts: By attaching semantic meaning to colours, the window system should be able to assist the user in solving the problem of effective and aesthetic colour selection. 1.6 Goals The kind of tool created here is something analogous to the jostling window system <ref> (Schlueter, 1990) </ref>. This system attached semantic meaning to windows and their contents and defined relationships between these elements of the display. The system imposed constraints on the possible positions of the windows based on these relationships.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested, based on their work, that there may be only 11 categories of basic colour sensations, each associated with a well-learned name and possibly a unique physiological substrate. Basic colour terms provide faster and more reliable colour naming than other terms, with greater agreement amount viewers. <ref> (Smallman and Boynton, 1990) </ref>. Colour naming is important because colours on a display will often need to be cross referenced, as in the red window or the green window with blue text. <p> Background Basic Colour Mean Interpoint OSA Distance Yellow 13.84 White 13.01 Orange 12.73 Blue 12.14 Green 11.59 Pink 11.37 Purple 11.34 Black 11.30 Red 11.04 Brown 9.47 Table 2.3: Mean Interpoint Distance in the OSA Uniform Colour Space is OSA Units between Each Optimal Basic Colour and All Others <ref> (Smallman and Boynton, 1990) </ref> one extreme case, efficient colour coding can take place with 14 colours as long as they are well separated in the OSA space.

Reference-contexts: These events are only distributed to one interested process at a time and are used for synchronization because only one window at a time will receive the event and attempt to activate their colours. This prevents problems such as The Dining Philosophers Problem <ref> (Tanenbaum, 1986) </ref> from occuring and guarantees that one of the windows will activate its colours if there are enough LUT entries. 6.3.5 ClassColourShifter A potential problem with changing colours via a distributed jostling model is that colours are not guaranteed to take a straight or smooth path to their final colour <p> Since each instance of the constraint can be used multiple times, the code between setting the hue range and invoking the superclass method is a critical section <ref> (Tanenbaum, 1986) </ref>. Synchronization is provided by enclosing the setting of the superclass hue range and the invocation of its check, apply or pickrandom method with a monitor. As mentioned above, the class definition for ClassCCAnalogousVariation is quite short, demonstrating how simple new constraints are to create.
