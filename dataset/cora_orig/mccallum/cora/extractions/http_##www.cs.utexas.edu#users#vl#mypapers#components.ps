Title: Two Components of An Action Language  
Author: Vladimir Lifschitz

Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at Austin  
Abstract: Some of the recent work on representing action makes use of high-level action languages. In this paper we show that an action language can be represented as the sum of two distinct parts: an "action description language" and an "action query language." A set of propositions in an action description language describes the effects of actions on states. Mathematically, it defines a transition system of the kind familiar from the theory of finite automata. An action query language serves for expressing properties of paths in a given transition system. We define the general concepts of a transition system, of an action description language and of an action query language, give a series of examples of languages of both kinds, and show how to combine a description language and a query language into one. This construction makes it possible to design the two components of an action language independently, which leads to the simplification and clarification of the theory of actions.

Reference-contexts: For some authors, a state is completely described by all relevant facts about it ("For a Blocks World with three blocks, there are 13 possible states" <ref> [ Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987 ] </ref> ).

Reference-contexts: a transition system is always defined in such a way that every state is a valuation, and the values of fluents are defined by the equation V (F; s) = s (F ): (1) But there are cases when states have to be defined as valuations with some additional information <ref> [ Giunchiglia and Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> . A transition system can be viewed as a directed graph whose vertices are states. With every vertex s we associate the valuation F 7! V (F; s).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Properties of actions have been the subject of research in the theory of commonsense knowledge since its early days. Even if we restrict attention to the representations based on the ontology of the situation calculus <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> , we will need to distinguish between proposals of several kinds, differing by the choice of the underlying logic. <p> For some authors, a state is completely described by all relevant facts about it ("For a Blocks World with three blocks, there are 13 possible states" [ Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987 ] ).

The treatment of states in this section is compatible with both views. An action signature consists of three nonempty sets of symbols: a set V of values, a set F of fluent names, and a set A of action names.

Reference-contexts: causal law, in relation to the ramification problem, was developed in [ Geffner, 1990 ] , [ Elkan, 1992 ] , [ Brewka and Hertzberg, 1993 ] , [ Baral, 1995 ] , [ Lin, 1995 ] , [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] , [ Thielscher, 1995 ] and <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> . More recent research was described in the talks given by some of these authors at the workshop on causality held at the University of Texas at Austin in May of 1996. <p> McCain and Turner discussed, in particular, the difference between the "foundationalist" theory from [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] and alternative "nonfoundationalist" approaches. The papers [ Baral, 1995 ] and <ref> [ Turner, 1997 ] </ref> incorporate fact causality in action languages. They are restricted, however, to the case when all fluents are truth-valued, and they prohibit or restrict the use of noninertial fluent names.

Reference-contexts: Adding ramification constraints to action languages was proposed in [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] . The semantics of these propositions follows <ref> [ Winslett, 1988 ] </ref> . McCain and Turner [1995] convincingly argue that many examples usually expressed in terms of ramification constraints can be better described by more general "static causal laws." Still, there are cases when ramification constraints are useful.
