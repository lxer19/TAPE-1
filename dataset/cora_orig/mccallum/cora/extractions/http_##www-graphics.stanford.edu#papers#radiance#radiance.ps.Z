Title: Wavelet Methods for Radiance Computations  
Author: Peter Schrder Pat Hanrahan 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Princeton University  
Abstract: This paper describes a new algorithm to compute radiance in a synthetic environment. Motivated by the success of wavelet methods for radiosity computations we have applied multi wavelet bases to the computation of radiance in the presence of glossy reflectors. We have implemented this algorithm and report on some experiments performed with it. In particular we show that the convergence properties of basis functions with 1-4 vanishing moments are in accordance with theoretical predictions. As in the case of wavelet radiosity we find higher order bases to have advantages. However, the cost scaling due to the higher dimensionality of the problem is such that the higher order bases only become competitive for very high precision requirements. In practice we rarely go beyond piecewise linear functions.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe our implementation of a higher order hierarchical Galerkin algorithm using multi wavelet bases <ref> [1] </ref> to solve for radiance in the presence of glossy reflectors. <p> The parameters r; p 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> control roughness and anisotropy respectively. The Fresnel factor was set to one. The images in Figure 10 (see color section) show the use of the anisotropy factor. The approximation as given is not normalized and its hemispherical reflectance is not independent of incoming angle.

Reference-contexts: All of these have suffered from high computational complexity and consequently extremely long simulation times. Significant progress in the reduction of the overall computational order of the radiance problem occurred recently when Aup-perle and Hanrahan <ref> [2] </ref> extended their earlier hierarchical radiosity work to radiance. <p> There are still links which govern the exchange of power. Instead of links only between surface elements there are now also links between pairs of surface elements (with the middle surface matching up). The resulting data structures follow closely the ideas presented by Aupperle and Hanrahan in <ref> [2] </ref>. A refinement procedure refines links as before based on an oracle while gathering occurs across links (both inter surface and inter surface-pairs). Visibility is determined as described by Teller and Hanrahan [24]. The actual code is a strict superset of our earlier wavelet radiosity code. <p> This polynomial is measured against the actual kernel function using a number of new sample points. The resulting error estimate is augmented by a geometric analysis. The geometric analysis was inspired by the observations that Aupperle and Han-rahan <ref> [2] </ref> made. Very peaked BRDF functions are easily missed if only a small number of samples of the integrand are taken. To decrease the chance of aliasing problems due to missing this peak we have augmented the oracle with a geometric analysis. <p> For a given triplet of surfaces exchanging power we consider the range of outgoing angles on X, incoming angles on Y, and outgoing angles on Y using straightforward geometric analysis (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The resulting ranges of angles are used in an interval evaluation of the shading model itself giving max and min values of f r over the surfaces in question. <p> As was done in the earlier work concerning wavelet radios-ity [8, 19] we have in effect extended an earlier hierarchical technique to higher orders: in the case of radiosity the work reported in [9] and in the case of radiance the work reported in <ref> [2] </ref> . The benefits are similar. The quality of the computed images increases markedly when going from piecewise constant bases to piecewise linear (or higher).

Reference-contexts: be consolidated with a push/pull operation * refinement proceeds by replacing earlier (coarser) couplings * a simple recursive procedure provably accounts for all im portant transports (for tree wavelets) * the number of necessary coefficients is O (n) versus O (n log n), where n is the number of elements <ref> [4] </ref>. These issues are further compounded by the independent issues associated with primal and dual bases. For example, if the dual hierarchy does not have vanishing moments then this by itself causes the need for a wavelet up/down transformation independent of the standard or non-standard realization of the operator itself. <p> In the standard realization there is no overrepresentation of bases at the different levels of resolution. Consequently refinement proceeds by adding a detail function wherever the error criterion is not met. The standard realization does require couplings between all levels of the hierarchy however <ref> [4] </ref>, resulting in the O (n log n) complexity. Whether the extra factor of log n is very noticeable for the regimes in which radiosity or radiance computations are performed is an open question of research.

Reference-contexts: Much attention has been devoted to the diffuse case and a number of radiosity algorithms have been proposed.

Only few results have been reported on attempts to solve the more general rendering equation [13]. There have been some attempts at extending radiosity to handle specular or glossy reflections [12, 20, 21, 14] or to use finite element methods directly to solve the rendering equation [22]. <p> These are separate issues and either one admits to so called standard and non-standard treatments. In particular we are using a non-standard realization of the operator as was done in the original wavelet radiosity work <ref> [19, 8] </ref>. <p> One of the major issues in any wavelet based algorithm is the enumeration of all important couplings. For tree wavelets (neighboring wavelets have no overlapping support) this is straightforward as wavelets and their supports are uniquely identified with sections of geometry (elements). A simple recursive procedure <ref> [9, 8] </ref> considers the coupling between surfaces and naturally accounts for all energy transfers while maintaining some error threshold ProjectKernel ( Basis ij, Basis mn ) error = Oracle ( ij, mn ); if ( Accept ( error ) || RecurLimit ( ij, mn ) ) T ijmn = Quadrature ( <p> As mentioned above we use a spatial parameterization with multi wavelet (piecewise polynomial) bases. This approach is a direct extension of the earlier wavelet radiosity work reported in <ref> [8, 19] </ref>. The main difference is the added number of dimensions. Coefficients of basis functions are not tied to individual surfaces anymore but rather to pairs of surfaces. There are still links which govern the exchange of power. <p> The error estimate for the coupling is determined by a a polynomial oracle similar to the one described in <ref> [8] </ref>. In the case of radiance the polynomial estimator extends over 6 dimensions rather than 4, but the basic logic remains the same. The samples of the kernel function generated as part of the quadrature routine are used to construct an interpolating polynomial. <p> Gathering of radiance occurs across glossy and mixed links and is only distinguished by the dimensionality of the quantities being moved and multiplied with coupling coefficients. 4 Results The above algorithm has been implemented as part of our rendering testbed <ref> [8, 19, 7, 24] </ref>.
