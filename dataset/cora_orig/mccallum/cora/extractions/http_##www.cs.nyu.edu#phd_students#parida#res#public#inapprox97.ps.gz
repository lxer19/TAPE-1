Abstract: Courant Inst. of Math. Sciences Technical report, TR1997-740, August 1997. (Also submitted for journal publication) Abstract Optical Mapping is a single molecule approach capable of constructing ordered restriction maps of DNA molecules and raises many interesting computational problems. Some computational complexity aspects of a these problems have been addressed previously [AMS97, DHM97, MP96], but it had remained unresolved if they yield to polynomial time approximation schemes. In this paper we resolve most of these open problems (such as BFC [GP96, MP96], pairwise match [AMS97, Ree97] problems and others) and also improve on earlier results on other problems [AMS97, DHM97]. We show that all the problems, with only one exception, are MAX SNP-hard. This implies that obtaining an * approximation for a problem, where * &gt; * 0 , for some fixed * 0 (depending on the problem) is also NP hard. Further, we obtain theoretical upper bounds on the polynomial time approximation factors for all of the above problems that are hard. (See Table 1 for a summary of the results.) The proof technique uses a gap-preserving reduction of an instance of a graph problem to these problems. We believe that our results would give insight to computational biologists in designing better heuristics for the problems, and to biochemists in understanding the trade-offs among the various error sources. Since similar problems are likely to arise in other single molecule methods as well, we believe that the study of these problems would be of interest to a larger group of biochemists, molecular biologists and others.

Missing Fragments. John can remove some fragments of the string. This corresponds to fragments that get washed away during the experiment, which is common for BAC DNA, although not for cosmids and DNA <ref> [AMS97] </ref>. We will study the problem under the simplified model of Ann providing an S 0 that minimizes the number of (certain) alterations that John makes to produce the m data set from this S 0 . <p> It is quite clear that an optimization problem of this nature would be the underlying problem for most models, even probabilistic ones such as the one used in <ref> [AMS97] </ref>. The alterations for which Ann has to pay a "price" are: (1) changing a 1 to 0, or (2) a 0 to 1 3 . Any other change comes for free. <p> BFC problem [GP96]: The total number of 1's in the consensus cut columns, J, which is at least mp J in each, is maximized. 2.

Reference-contexts: Large scale construction of ordered restriction maps for eukaryotic chromosomes is laborious and difficult, in part because traditional approaches to molecular analysis were designed to analyze genes rather than genomes. A single molecule approach called Optical Mapping <ref> [WHS95, Men+95, Sch+93] </ref> is a new approach for the rapid production of ordered restriction maps. Optical Mapping fixes elongated DNA molecules onto surfaces by electrostatic interactions. The fixation conditions are carefully controlled in order to allow enzymatic reactions on the surface. The restriction sites are detected by flourescence microscopy.

(Also submitted for journal publication) The d-wise Match problem (which has also been defined in <ref> [Par97] </ref>) takes the following errors into account: (1) false positives, (2) false negatives and (3) orientations. d-wise Match (dM) problem: Given m molecules with n sites each, with false positive and negative errors and orientation uncertainties, and a fixed 1 &lt; d m, ffi &gt; 0, find an alignment to the

Reference-contexts: In addition, we show that d-wise Match (dM) problem [Par97], which formalizes one of the heuristic approaches in [AMS97] and the approach in the thesis <ref> [Ree97] </ref>, is MAX SNP-hard and achieving an approximation ratio 1 is NP-hard. <p> SNP-hard and give an upper bound on the polynomial time approximation factor of the problem. (See theorem 4.) 3. dM Problem [Par97]: This is an alternate view to the problem modeling the same errors as BFC and is the underlying model in the heuristic in [AMS97] and the approach in <ref> [Ree97] </ref>. We show a simple example, in Figure 1, that shows BFC and BFC max problems give rise to different optimal alignments and maps. <p> This has been the basis for certain heuristics such as weighted cliques (section 4 in [AMS97]) and the approach in <ref> [Ree97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Large scale construction of ordered restriction maps for eukaryotic chromosomes is laborious and difficult, in part because traditional approaches to molecular analysis were designed to analyze genes rather than genomes. A single molecule approach called Optical Mapping <ref> [WHS95, Men+95, Sch+93] </ref> is a new approach for the rapid production of ordered restriction maps. Optical Mapping fixes elongated DNA molecules onto surfaces by electrostatic interactions. The fixation conditions are carefully controlled in order to allow enzymatic reactions on the surface. The restriction sites are detected by flourescence microscopy.

However, the orientation information may be given in the data (using a more elaborate chemical protocol) with a vector arm on one fixed side of the molecule <ref> [WHS95] </ref>. The model can view this as a consensus cut site at one end of the map. Notwithstanding this, there is a non-zero probability of the orientation of the molecule being still unknown. Missing Fragments.
