Title: Data and Server Management for a Distributed Workflow System  
Author: Mark D. Spiller and L. Kristin Wright 
Date: May 16, 1997  
Abstract: This paper describes a workflow design that addresses current research areas in workflow systems. The specific type of workflow we design for is a CAD Design workflow. However, we believe our resulting architecture is suitable for general work-flows models.

Reference-contexts: In general, they have limited fault tolerance, do not scale well, have poor availability due to lack of replication, do not address mobile computing needs and lack in adequate transaction models <ref> [AAAM97] </ref>. Thus, it is generally agreed that there are still some areas of research in workflow systems. Crucial areas of work include fault tolerance, continuous availability and replication [MAG + 95]. <p> our design at the 1997 Design Automation Conference where we hope to receive a positive reception and thereby motivate outside parties to contribute tools of their own. 7 Limitations in our Design Our toolflow design does not interact with other work-flow systems, functionality that the literature recommends [MAG + 95] <ref> [AAAM97] </ref>. Also, security is an issue as data is possibly flowing through wide-area 7 networks.

Reference-contexts: There have been several research systems presented that attempt to offer similar functionalities as our system.

Reference-contexts: Although it seems as if many more people should be working in this area since CAD workflows are certainly a reality, we were surprised to find last year at the Design Automation Conference <ref> [DAC] </ref> that noone else was presenting similar work. The WELD concept demo at this conference was met with an overwhelming positive response, including front page coverage in the EE Times (demo materials available at [WEL]).

Reference-contexts: Active documents [SK94] presents a distributed design system, but the technology used (Tcl/Tk) has not been updated to today's capabilities, such as Java, and we have not been able to find follow-ons to that research. The Collaborative Benchmarking Laboratory at NCSU <ref> [KLB97] </ref> is doing work very similar to what the WELD Group at UCB [WEL] is working on with the intention of building a system for distributed benchmarking and design. Currently, they use Tcl/Tk and X over the net, which is somewhat different from our model.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is generally agreed that there are still some areas of research in workflow systems. Crucial areas of work include fault tolerance, continuous availability and replication <ref> [MAG + 95] </ref>. In this paper, we will present a distributed work-flow design system that addresses exactly these areas of research and report on the implementation status of our design. <p> Using a browser interface provides a simple, familiar interface which furthers our design goal of providing ease of use. Using a browser interface also allows the user to be mobile. Although this is not one of our primary goals, it is a current topic in workflow research <ref> [MAG + 95] </ref>. Once the Toolflow has been created and started, the Toolflow Monitor will show the user the toolflow's state by showing the Tool Servers in different color according to whether they are in progress, done or not started. <p> Which database engine is used is unimportant; what is relevant about the Database Server in our design is the transaction model that we define. Workflow systems are usually characterized by long-lived transactions and thus a need for advanced 4 transaction models [SSU95] <ref> [MAG + 95] </ref>. One ac-tivity may take many days; perhaps a clerk who is to process an application is on vacation. Our toolflow system is no different. The CAD tools offered by the Tool Servers in a workflow could take hours or days to process the data. <p> We will demonstarte our design at the 1997 Design Automation Conference where we hope to receive a positive reception and thereby motivate outside parties to contribute tools of their own. 7 Limitations in our Design Our toolflow design does not interact with other work-flow systems, functionality that the literature recommends <ref> [MAG + 95] </ref> [AAAM97]. Also, security is an issue as data is possibly flowing through wide-area 7 networks. <p> This all indicates that this is a a very fruitful area of research, especially in light of the new network technologies available, such as Java. 10 Conclusion <ref> [MAG + 95] </ref> cites 6 major workflow areas in need of research: fault tolerance, compensation and navigation, high availability via replication, mobile computing, distributed coordination and advanced transaction models.

Reference-contexts: The current generation of CAD design environments make two assumptions <ref> [SK94] </ref>: 1. All information is available locally to the design team. 2. The design primarily is the product of a single or ganization/location. These assumptions are no longer valid, however. It is common for CAD designers to want their design processed by an off-site design tool. <p> There have been several research systems presented that attempt to offer similar functionalities as our system. The VOV system [CNAV90], [CR94] wraps existing tools in order to dynamically analyze flow dependencies and provide load balancing services on a local area network.
