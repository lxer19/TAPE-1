Abstract: In multimedia database applications, a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image. To process such queries, a spatial similarity algorithm is required. A spatial similarity algorithm assesses the degree to which the spatial relationships among the domain objects in a database image conform to those specifled in the query image. In this paper, we propose a geometry-based representation, referred to as the &lt; String, and an associated algorithm for e-cient and efiective retrieval of images by spatial similarity. It is formally shown that the proposed algorithm recognizes both translation, scale, and rotation variants of an image and variants of an image generated by an arbitrary composition of translation, scale, and rotation transformations. The algorithm has (n log n) time complexity in terms of the number of objects common to the database and query images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with two of the previously known algorithms using TESSA image collection. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is not only more e-cient but also performs as well as or better than the other algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The flrst one is norm the system-provided rank ordering (obtained using a spatial similarity algorithm) and the second is the expert-provided rank ordering that deflnes the desired system output. R measure returns a norm value in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Intuitively, an R value of 1 indicates that the system-provided rank norm ordering is identical to the expert-provided rank ordering and lower values indicate a proportional disagreement between the two. <p> For example, in flgure 6 (section 6), image 4 is a subimage of image 1. The proposed algorithm, SIM ; has all these G characteristics and is discussed next. Formally, we deflne SI M ; as: G SIM : I I ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; q G d where I and I are the symbolic representations of the query and database images. <p> Statements 15 and 16 address the above issues for the right neighbor of an object. Note that ObjectFactor +2 (SpatialFactor) +2 (ScaleFactor) = 1 to insure the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for SIM (see lemma 3.2 below). In summary, the G three factors provide the users substantial exibility in adapting the algorithm to realize efiective retrieval of images by spatial similarity from the view point of their domain semantics. <p> This 1 algorithm recognizes only translation and scale variant images. An extension of this work appears in [7] and the enhanced 2-D String is referred to as generalized 2-D String. Another extension of 2-D String to facilitate spatial reasoning is reported in [6] and to image sequence compression in <ref> [1] </ref>. Generalization of 2-D String representation to higher dimensions appears in [10] and retrieval algorithms are adapted from the 2-D counterparts. An approach to spatial similarity based on ordered triple representation of symbolic images is proposed in [4]. <p> Expert-provided rank ordering of the TESSA images for the test queries is given in [16]. The R measure returns a value in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Intuitively, an R value of 1 indicates norm norm that the system-provided rank ordering is identical to the expert-provided rank ordering and lower values indicate a proportional disagreement between the two. <p> A linear interpolation is used to transform the range of 2DS algorithms from <ref> [1; 7] </ref> to [0; 1]: Based on table 1, one would expect a spatial similarity algorithm to conclude that images 33-43 (image 33 and its flrst 10 transformation variants) are spatially identical by assigning the highest 25 26 27 similarity value for any pair in this set. <p> A linear interpolation is used to transform the range of 2DS algorithms from [1; 7] to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: Based on table 1, one would expect a spatial similarity algorithm to conclude that images 33-43 (image 33 and its flrst 10 transformation variants) are spatially identical by assigning the highest 25 26 27 similarity value for any pair in this set.

Reference-contexts: Though the algorithm recognizes various transformation variants, subimages and transformation variants of subimages, it may be possible to conceive certain degenerate test cases for which the algorithm sufiers. Overall, the algorithm should perform well in practical applications. An inverted flle type of index <ref> [12] </ref> would help to reduce the number of database images involved in processing a spatial similarity query. An inverted flle for a symbolic image database is a sorted list (or index) of domain object names.

Reference-contexts: These measures are referred to as Type-0, Type-1, and Type-2 similarities. Of all the three, Type-2 requires the most stringent matching. We refer to Type-0, Type-1, and Type-2 algorithms as 2DS 0; 2DS 1; and 2DS 2 algorithms. Since flnding a maximal clique in a graph is NP-Complete <ref> [13] </ref>, the complexity of these algorithms is exponential in terms of the number of objects common to the query and database images. Therefore, these algorithms may have a limited use in retrieving from realistic image databases. Furthermore, they recognize translation and scale variant images but not the rotation variant.

Reference-contexts: The 1 2 n following section concludes the paper. 7 Conclusions Most of the existing approaches to retrieving images have generally been in one of the two directions <ref> [14] </ref>. In one direction, systems that emphasize various kinds of image understanding techniques are developed. A main component is designed for computing indexable features of the images from their low level representations (e.g., raster or vector formats). These features play a prominent role in processing the user queries.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, SIM recognizes subimages of the query image (or transformation variants of the subimage) in the G database images. The performance of SIM is evaluated using TESSA image testbed collection G <ref> [16] </ref>. The TESSA collection comprises 160 images, produced by generating 15 variants of each of the 10 original images. Image variants are produced by scale, rotation, and translation, and by an arbitrary composition of these three transformations. The variants are designed to inquire into the robustness of spatial similarity algorithms. <p> The details of the testbed images used for part of G the experimental study are presented next. 5 The TESSA Image Collection The TESSA image collection consists of 10 original images and 15 variants of each of these original images <ref> [16] </ref>. The original images are shown in flgure 5. Since the collection has a total of 160 images and each original image has 15 variants, the numbers for original images are 1, 17, 33, 49, 65, 81, 97, 113, 129, and 145. <p> Expert-provided rank ordering of the TESSA images for the test queries is given in <ref> [16] </ref>. The R measure returns a value in the interval [0; 1]. Intuitively, an R value of 1 indicates norm norm that the system-provided rank ordering is identical to the expert-provided rank ordering and lower values indicate a proportional disagreement between the two. <p> On the other hand, consider image 38 as a query image and all group 3 images as the database images. It should be noted that image 38 is obtained from image 33 by rotating image 33 about an arbitrary point by 120 in the clockwise direction <ref> [16] </ref>. Its similarity with all other images in group 3 (except with itself) is quite low. This clearly demonstrates that all three 2DS algorithms do not recognize rotational variant images. <p> The result of applying SIM ; SOG; and 2DS algorithms on G this subset is shown in flgure 13. Note that 4 of 6 objects of image 49 have undergone rotation by 170 degree to produce the MRV (image 60) and images 61-64 are variants of image 60 <ref> [16] </ref>. Since two-thirds of objects of image 49 have undergone rotation and the rotation is fairly large, it is more di-cult and not natural to perceive the resulting image as a MRV than as an entirely difierent image. <p> G 6.3 The Role of SpatialFactor, ScaleFactor, and ObjectFactor Consider image 44 as the query image and images 44, 46-48 as database images. Note that images 46-48 are generated from image 44 by a composite transformation involving scaling about an arbitrary point (scale factors: 1.20, 1.40, and 1.60, respectively) <ref> [16] </ref>. The interaction of SpatialFactor and ScaleFactor on this set of images is shown in flgure 14. The axis labeled Factor Combinations 28 shows the values assigned to three factors of SIM algorithm. <p> We designate each database image as a query image in turn, and thus constitute a set of 32 test queries. For each test query, the expert-provided rank ordering of database images is given in <ref> [16] </ref>. System-provided rank ordering is obtained by executing spatial similarity algorithms on the database images for each query in the test set. Using these two rank orderings, we compute R measure for each test query for norm all the flve algorithms. These results are illustrated in flgure 18.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm has quadratic time complexity in terms of the number of objects common to the query and database images. We refer to this algorithm as SOG algorithm. SOG recognizes translation, scale, and rotational variant images. An extension of SOG algorithm for 3-D image databases appears in <ref> [18] </ref>. In [30], a set of rules are proposed to deduce new spatial relationships from a given set of relationships. These rules are shown to be sound and complete for 3-D images and incomplete for 18 2-D images.

Reference-contexts: Image variants are produced by scale, rotation, and translation, and by an arbitrary composition of these three transformations. The variants are designed to inquire into the robustness of spatial similarity algorithms. We also compare and contrast the performance of SIM with those of two other algorithms: G SOG <ref> [19] </ref> and 2D-Strings [27]. Like the SIM algorithm, SOG and 2D-Strings algorithms deal G only with spatial relationships of objects and not with object shapes.

This quantiflcation is based on a measure referred to as the R [3]. R measure enables us to objectively assess norm norm the retrieval efiectiveness of spatial similarity algorithms. The calculation of R requires two norm rank orderings of the TESSA images relative to a query image.

Reference-contexts: Content-based retrieval is characterized by the ability of the system to retrieve relevant images based on the actual image contents rather than using simple attributes or keywords associated with the images [20]. In <ref> [22] </ref>, we have identifled the following generic query classes to support content-based retrieval of images from large repositories: Retrieval by Browsing, Retrieval by Objective Attributes, Retrieval by Spatial Constraints, Retrieval by Shape Similarity, Retrieval by Volume Similarity, Retrieval by Subjective Attributes, Retrieval by Color, Retrieval by Texture, Retrieval by Motion, Retrieval <p> In Real Estate marketing, user queries may include spatial relationships among the various functional units in addition to the attributes such as the location, cost, number of bedrooms in a house <ref> [22] </ref>. An example of such a query might be "Show me the houses where all the bedrooms are located to the left of both the living room and kitchen?" An informal study conducted using a prototype Realtors Information System which features RSS queries [22] has shown that Realtors are able to <p> cost, number of bedrooms in a house <ref> [22] </ref>. An example of such a query might be "Show me the houses where all the bedrooms are located to the left of both the living room and kitchen?" An informal study conducted using a prototype Realtors Information System which features RSS queries [22] has shown that Realtors are able to locate relevant houses to their clients quickly. Realtors note that attributes such as location, cost, number of bedrooms serve only to determine a subset of the houses to show to their clients. <p> The set of images retrieved using (0, 0.5, 0) factor combination can be reranked using (0, 0, 0.5) factor combination. This helps to lessen the dominance of weak order problem. For example, in Real estate marketing application <ref> [22] </ref>, for a given spatial conflguration of various rooms (query image), there may be hundreds of houses for sale with identical spatial conflguration.

An extension of this work considers the spatial extent of domain objects and appears in [26]. Spatial knowledge is represented using a string referred to as 2D C-String <ref> [25] </ref>. As in the earlier work, three measures (Type-0, Type-1, and Type-2) for spatial similarity are deflned and spatial similarity is quantifled based on the size of maximal clique. A spatial similarity measure based on spatial orientation graph (SOG) representation of an image is introduced in [19].

Reference-contexts: The variants are designed to inquire into the robustness of spatial similarity algorithms. We also compare and contrast the performance of SIM with those of two other algorithms: G SOG [19] and 2D-Strings <ref> [27] </ref>. Like the SIM algorithm, SOG and 2D-Strings algorithms deal G only with spatial relationships of objects and not with object shapes.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm has quadratic time complexity in terms of the number of objects common to the query and database images. We refer to this algorithm as SOG algorithm. SOG recognizes translation, scale, and rotational variant images. An extension of SOG algorithm for 3-D image databases appears in [18].

These rules are shown to be sound and complete for 3-D images and incomplete for 18 2-D images. <p> These system represent images by a set of attributes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent advances in high performance computing and communications, and the emergence of various types of storage media have spurred a tremendous interdisciplinary interest in Multimedia Systems in general and Multimedia Database applications in particular <ref> [31] </ref>. Methods for e-cient storage and content-based retrieval of images play an important role in Multimedia Database applications. Content-based retrieval is characterized by the ability of the system to retrieve relevant images based on the actual image contents rather than using simple attributes or keywords associated with the images [20].
