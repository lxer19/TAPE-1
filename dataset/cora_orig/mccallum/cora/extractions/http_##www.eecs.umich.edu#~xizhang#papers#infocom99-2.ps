Abstract: This paper analyzes the scalability of a flow-control algorithm for multicast ABR (Available Bit Rate) service. A key idea behind the algorithm is the Soft-Synchronization Protocol (SSP), which derives a single "consolidated" RM (Resource Management) cell at each multicast branch-point from feedback RM-cells of different downstream branches that are not necessarily responses to the same forward RM-cell in each synchronization cycle. Using balanced and unbalanced binary-tree models, we analyze the scalability of SSP in terms of height and structure of the multicast tree. In contrast with the other existing schemes, SSP is shown to be able to effectively support synchronization of feedback RM-cells and make the effective RM-cell roundtrip delay virtually independent of the multicast-tree's height and structure, thus making it scalable. Another key problem in multicast flow-control is how to deal with the variation of RM-cell roundtrip delay due to the drifting bottleneck in a multicast tree. This problem is handled by adapting the second-order rate-control parameter to roundtrip-delay variations. Using a fluid model, we derive an analytical relationship between the second-order rate parameter and RM-cell roundtrip delay subject to both lossless transmission and finite buffer capacity constraints. This relationship ensures the feasibility of the second-order rate control in dealing with RM-cell roundtrip-delay variations and provides an insight on how the required buffer space can be controlled by adjusting the rate parameter. We develop an optimal control condition under which the second-order rate control guarantees monotonic convergence of the system state to the optimal regime from an arbitrary initial value. The proposed second-order rate-control algorithm is also shown to be feasible and optimal in buffer-allocation efficiency and fairness at the bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: The multicast service is said to be not scalable if performance, such as throughput, delay and fairness, degrades when the number of receivers, the height and path-length of the multicast tree become large. The scalability problem often arises due to the feedback implosion problem <ref> [1] </ref>. When the size of multicast group is large, the congestion feedback responses generated by a single multicast message can overwhelm the entire network or the multicast source. To achieve scalability, the congestion feedback responses at each branch-point must be "consolidated" and only the consolidated feedback is sent upward.

Reference-contexts: To overcome the above-mentioned problems, we proposed a new multicast flow-control scheme in a companion paper <ref> [9] </ref> (available on-line). Our proposed scheme consists of two key components: the soft-synchronization protocol (SSP) and the second-order rate control algorithm. <p> Using the second-order rate control, the maximum buffer requirement and queueing delay scale well with the bottleneck path's roundtrip-delay variations. In this paper, we will focus on the property and correctness analysis of our proposed multicast flow-control scheme while detailing the flow-control algorithm in our companion paper <ref> [9] </ref>. Using balanced/unbalanced binary-tree models, we analytically evaluate the SSP's scalability with respect to multicast-tree's height and path-length variations. <p> Section 4 studies analytical properties and correctness of the second-order rate control. The paper concludes with Section 5. 2 The Proposed Scheme and Its Analytical Model 2.1 Overview For the purpose of completeness, we briefly describe our proposed scheme and refer the interested readers to <ref> [9] </ref> which contains a complete description of the proposed scheme.

Reference-contexts: A forward RM-cell is sent by the root (source) periodically or once every N rm data-cells, and each leaf node (receiver) replies by returning to the source a feedback RM-cell with EFCI and ER (Explicit Rate) information. We redefine the RM-cell format <ref> [10] </ref> such that it contains both the cell-rate (first-order) and the rate-parameter (second-order) control information. More specifically, two new 2 one-bit fields, BCI (Buffer Congestion Indication) and NMQ (New Maximum Queue), are defined.
