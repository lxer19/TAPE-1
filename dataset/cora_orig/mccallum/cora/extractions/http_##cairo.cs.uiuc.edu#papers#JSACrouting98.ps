Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed QoS routing scheme which selects a network path with sufficient resources to satisfy certain delay (or bandwidth) requirement in a dynamic multi-hop mobile environment. The proposed algorithms work with imprecise state information. Multiple paths are searched in parallel to find the best qualified one. Fault-tolerance techniques are brought in for the maintenance of the routing paths when the nodes move, join or leave the network. Our algorithms consider not only the QoS requirement but also the cost optimality of the routing path in order to improve the overall network performance. Extensive simulations show that high call-admission ratio and low-cost paths are achieved with modest routing overhead. The algorithms can also tolerate high degree of information imprecision.

Reference-contexts: In the distributed routing [4, 11, 19, 20], the path is computed by a distributed computation during which control messages are exchanged among the nodes and the state information kept at each node is collectively used in order to find a path. In the hierarchical routing <ref> [7] </ref>, nodes are clustered into groups, which are recursively clustered into higher-level groups, creating a multi-level hierarchy. In every level of the hierarchy, source or distributed routing algorithms are used. The QoS routing algorithms for wireline networks can not be applied directly to ad-hoc networks.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we shall not make any of such assumptions. We propose a distributed QoS routing scheme for ad-hoc networks. Two routing problems are studied. They are the delay-constrained least-cost routing and the bandwidth-constrained least-cost routing. The first one is NP-complete <ref> [9] </ref>. The second one is solvable in polynomial time, given precise state information. A path which satisfies the delay (or bandwidth) constraint is called a feasible path. The following design goals are achieved. 1. The algorithms can tolerate the imprecision of the available state information. <p> When there are multiple feasible paths, we want to select the one with the least cost. Finding the delay-constrained least-cost path is NP-complete <ref> [9] </ref>. Another problem is bandwidth-constrained routing, i.e., finding a path P s.t. bandwidth (P ) B, where B is the bandwidth requirement. When there are multiple such paths, the one with the least cost is selected.

Reference-contexts: Long paths are often assigned when resource contention occurs. However, as the network topology changes and connections are established or torn down upon completion, the network state changes locally and globally, which makes the routes of the remaining connections less optimal <ref> [17] </ref>. Routes with light (heavy) traffic at the beginning may become congested (lightly loaded) later. Shorter paths for some connections may become available. Re-routing helps to balance the network traffic on the fly and improves the resource efficiency, which is especially important in an ad-hoc network where resources are scarce.

As shown by Shin and Chou <ref> [20] </ref>, when certain scheduling policies are used and the routing messages are set to the appropriate priority, the routing messages travel at speeds according to the link delays. Hence, the message traveling along the least-delay path arrives first.

Reference-contexts: compar-ing to the contiguous traffic of a typical voice connection, the re-routing overhead is relatively small as far as it is not done too frequently, which will be more evident after the simulation results are presented in Section 6. 4.6 Soft states Re-routing can be used in conjunction with RSVP <ref> [23] </ref>, which is a resource reservation protocol. RSVP is based on soft states, i.e. the resource reservation must be refreshed periodically. Soft states are deleted if not refreshed within a timeout period. This is important in an ad-hoc network due to the following reason. <p> Every entry is a soft state, which will be deleted if not refreshed. A refreshing message is sent from the destination back along the routing path to the source periodically <ref> [23] </ref>. When an intermediate node receives the message, it resets the timer of the corresponding soft state and forwards the message to the upstream node. Note that refreshing messages always follow the most recent routing path established by the last re-routing.
