Abstract: Providing the required interconnections between the processors of a parallel computer is a difficult problem: latency, switching control, cost, and crosstalk effects have to be taken into account. It is widely believed that the design might be simplified if optical technology is used. However, even optical interconnections cannot cater for an unlimited number of processors. For systems with up to about 10 5 10 6 processors, it seems that the arrangement of the processors in space so that each can "see" the others is the limiting factor; A large part of the volume involved must stay empty for the information-bearing light beams. above that, diffraction effects and power requirements place a limit on the number of processors.

Reference-contexts: These properties are determined by the technology that is used, by the layout of the network, and by the properties of the switching device. This paper is about networks using optical free-space technology, based on the "DynaSwitch" switching element <ref> [1] </ref>; possible designs that use this switch are outlined in the next section. Section 3 investigate how the network layout affects the number of PEs that may be connected within a given volume, based on geomet rical considerations. <p> Such networks are totally unpractical with electronic technology, because they require full interconnection. They are plausible, however, with optical free-space interconnections. The networks we study are based on the "DynaSwitch" switching element <ref> [1] </ref>. Technically, these networks use a beam steering approach rather than a beam spreading and masking approach [8, 9]. In other words, the switches are not fully connected on a permanent basis, but rather each can potentially form a direct connection with all the others.

Reference-contexts: The routing holograms direct the beam from one board to the next, until it reaches the bottom of the destination PE. A detailed description of this scheme is given in a separate paper <ref> [10] </ref>. The parameters that are used throughout the analysis are defined in table 1. 3. GEOMETRICAL CONSIDERATIONS Geometrical limitations are the result of the spatial layout of the network.

Reference-contexts: In real-life situations, one must take beam-expansion resulting from diffraction into account. We start with the following formula that describes the spot size for a beam with Gaussian cross section and initial radius s 0 after a distance ` <ref> [11] </ref>: s ` = s 2 ` 2 2 0 3 This expression ignores extra layers for crossing from one column to another. number of PEs accommodated within a given volume in the three schemes.

Reference-contexts: This agrees with the arguments presented by Goodman <ref> [12] </ref> about fan-in limitations when multiple beams are combined; it shows that the scheme with changing efficiencies is optimal. Note that the above derivation is based on the assumption that no additional losses occur as a result of diffraction in the propagation between boards. <p> Schemes using independent paths that only converge on the detector are more energy efficient than schemes that combine paths using holograms or semi-transparent mirrors, because of the N -fold loss due to the fan-in <ref> [12] </ref>. When a specific network is evaluated, general comments like the above are insufficient; a detailed study should be made. Specifically, the constants in the various expressions should be evaluated, and manufacturability and alignment considerations must be taken into account.

Discussion Power considerations limit the cube more than the other designs, because of the loss due to redundant beams that are created by the holograms.

Reference-contexts: The quantum limit on the power threshold needed by a detector operating at 10 GHz with an error rate of 10 9 is about 21 photons, which corresponds to D = 2:1 fi 10 8 Watt on average for = 1m <ref> [14] </ref>. As semiconductor lasers with an output power of E =~ 100mW are feasible, this would indicate that power requirements only become a limiting factor when more than a million processors are involved. Practical detectors, however, are much less efficient than the theoretical bound predicted by the quantum limit.
