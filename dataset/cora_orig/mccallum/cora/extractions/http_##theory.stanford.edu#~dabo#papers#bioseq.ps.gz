Abstract: We suggest an approach to sequencing based on a "divide and conquer method". This approach eliminates the need for solving a hard NP-complete problem which arises when using traditional sequencing techniques. At the present time this algorithm has not been tried out in the lab.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if the polymerase enzyme can not be made to replicate long strands for some fundamental reason then the algorithm is flawed (unless other methods for doing this replication can be found). We know of successes in doing PCR involving DNA strands containing 42,000 base pairs <ref> [1] </ref>. This implies that using current technology our technique can be made to sequence DNA strands of length 84,000. It is important to point out that standard PCR consists of many cycles. In each cycle the number of DNA strands roughly doubles.

Reference-contexts: This last step involves solving a hard NP-complete problem. This procedure is known as the double digest method. In this paper we propose a new approach for sequencing based on a divide and conquer algorithm which is similar to quicksort, a widely used sorting algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. We therefore refer to this algorithm as quick-sequence. This algorithm avoids the difficulty in recombining the information which arises when using the traditional approach. It should be pointed out that this algorithm has not been tested in the lab.

Reference-contexts: To produce T l and T r we use PCR <ref> [3] </ref> as follows: melt the double strands in the solution to single strands. Use P and it's Watson-Crick complement as primers and apply a polymerase enzyme. When the reaction is over melt the strands into single strands again.

Reference-contexts: The ligase must be used to connect the chain anchored at one primer to the chain anchored at the next primer. It is unclear whether a DNA ligase can be used in conjunction with a polymerase enzyme. However, it is our understanding that the ligase chain reaction <ref> [4] </ref> does exactly that. Once we obtain these strands we can follow the same procedure to produce the solution T l and T r .
