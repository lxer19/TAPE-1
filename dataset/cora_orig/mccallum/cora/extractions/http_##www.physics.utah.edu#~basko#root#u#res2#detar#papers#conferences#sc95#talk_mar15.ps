Reference-contexts: wide variety of scalable parallel computers, including the Intel Paragon, the Thinking Machines Corporation CM5, the Cray T3D, and, most recently, the IBM Scalable POWERparallel Systems SP2. 1 2 QCD on the Lattice The numerical simulation of QCD is based on the Feynman path integral formulation of the lattice theory <ref> [1] </ref>. The integration variables are associated with sites and links of a regular hypercubic lattice in a four-dimensional space time. To each link between nearest neighbors is associated an SU (3) matrix (three dimensional complex matrix) U for the gluon field.
Reference: [2] <institution> A link matrix is a product of an SU(3) matrix and a staggered fermion phase factor 1. </institution>
Reference: [3] <editor> We are restricting our attention to the "staggered" fermion scheme, </editor> <title> but our remarks should generalize easily to the alternative "Wilson" fermion scheme. </title>
Reference-contexts: The dagger represents the transpose conjugate. Each term in the sum over in the matrix D gives the gauge theory equivalent of a centered nearest neighbor finite difference gradient operator. The matrix D is antihermitian, so that D y = D <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 Conjugate Gradient Preparation The linear system (3) is solved using a conjugate gradient method after re-casting it in the positive definite form M y M = M y b: (6) where M y M = (2ma) 2 I + D y D (7) Some simplifications are possible.

Reference-contexts: vectors in () from the result of (5). 5 Performance on the SP2 Having outlined the algorithm we now describe its performance on the IBM SP2. 5.1 POWER2 features The SP2 node uses the POWER2 chip set, which features two floating add/multiply arithmetic processors and two fixed point arithmetic processors <ref> [5] </ref>. Each of the arithmetic units is capable of a double precision add and multiply in one clock cycle. Thus the peak speed in flops is four times the clock frequency, or 267 Megaflops for the present 67 MHz clock.
