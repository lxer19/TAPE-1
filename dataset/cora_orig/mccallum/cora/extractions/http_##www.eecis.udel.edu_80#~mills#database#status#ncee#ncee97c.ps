Reference-contexts: He is the principal architect of the hierarchical model proposed for the MBONE [14][15]. He and Mr. Cain are among the principal architects of the IGMP protocol, in particular IGMP Version 3 <ref> [1] </ref>, which bind multicast host receivers to local routers. This work has been reported at IETF meetings and, in the case of Mr. Cain, a Masters Thesis.

Reference-contexts: The modifications were implemented in the simulator and tested with real and synthetic data, as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Our near term plans include implementing these improvements in the current NTP software. <p> This work has been reported at IETF meetings and, in the case of Mr. Cain, a Masters Thesis. During the current funding period, the NTP software for Unix and Windows has been enhanced with several features which exploit multicast technology, as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Perhaps the most intricate has to do with simultaneous multicast and unicast operations where multicast service is used as backups for the more accurate unicast service.

Reference-contexts: A much better approach would have each client authenticate each server and synthesize keys automatically without relying on secret key files, as is now the standard practice. The application clearly calls for public-key cryptography; but, as described in <ref> [3] </ref> and [5], all known methods are too slow, even on fast, modern workstations, when clock accuracies better than a millisecond are required.

Reference-contexts: The papers and reports published by this investigator <ref> [4] </ref> reveal subtle differences in the stability characteristics of precision quartz oscillators and the uncompensated quartz oscillators used in typical workstations and servers. The recent analysis reported in [4] and [8] is based on a statistic used widely in the precision time and time interval community called Allan variance, but is <p> The papers and reports published by this investigator <ref> [4] </ref> reveal subtle differences in the stability characteristics of precision quartz oscillators and the uncompensated quartz oscillators used in typical workstations and servers. The recent analysis reported in [4] and [8] is based on a statistic used widely in the precision time and time interval community called Allan variance, but is in general little known outside that community. The project considered the same network paths as described in a network experiment described later in this report. <p> After nine months of continuous operation, the database amounts to well over a gigabyte. The results of a preliminary analysis of the database are reported in <ref> [4] </ref>, from which a few surprises emerge. One of them is that the differences between the outbound and reciprocal propagation delays on intercontinental circuits are surprisingly small, while the differences on domestic paths can be quite large.

The application clearly calls for public-key cryptography; but, as described in [3] and <ref> [5] </ref>, all known methods are too slow, even on fast, modern workstations, when clock accuracies better than a millisecond are required. <p> The scheme provides for the occasional loss of a message and for the infrequent use of public-key cryptography to verify the key list actually was generated by the intended server. 4 The revised security model and authentication scheme are described in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The specification has been amended twice, both to improve clarity, correct minor errors and provide support for IP Version 6 and OSI. The final draft of the specification has been published as an RFC <ref> [6] </ref>. There are now several shareware implementations of SNTP for various PCs, including Windows 95 and NT clients, Macintosh and others. While SNTP could in principle be used for Windows NT servers, the full NTP implementation is more appropriate for these servers and is now available. 6.

Reference-contexts: These include an audio device driver that can decode standard Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) signals to synchronize a workstation using the native audio codec, as well as an inexpensive LORAN-C receiver and software for a PC, and a DSP program that implements a digital modem for shortwave radio data transmission <ref> [7] </ref>. While useful for their intended purpose to synchronize computer clocks, the primary motivation for these projects was as demonstration and laboratory projects for graduate and undergraduate instruction.

Reference-contexts: In practice, each significant improvement in reading precision invites a reexamination of the NTP algorithms, since residual inaccuracies, formerly ignored in the interest of simplicity, become significant. The most recent reexamination <ref> [9] </ref> describes several incremental improvements which result in reliable time synchronization to the order less than a millisecond on LANs and lightly loaded T1 networks such as DARTnet. During the current funding period, a number of advances were made in the analysis, modeling and implementation of various timekeeping systems.

Reference-contexts: There have been numerous incremental upgrades since Version 3 came into use, all of which are backwards compatible. Eventually, these along with others proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>, will become the basis of NTP Version 4. During the current funding period, the Version 4 design has been upgraded in four important areas: autonomous configuration, security model and authentication scheme, clock discipline algorithms and multicasting technology. <p> Another feature designed, implemented and documented <ref> [10] </ref>, is a scheme where a multicast client polls a multicast server in clientserver mode in order to calibrate the multicast routing tree propagation delay and, after accurate calibration has been determined, revert to ordinary listen-only multicast mode.
