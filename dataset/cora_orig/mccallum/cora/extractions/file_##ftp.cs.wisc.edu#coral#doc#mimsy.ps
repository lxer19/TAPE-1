Abstract: This paper describes a real-world application built on top of the CORAL deductive database system. This application is meant to demonstrate the power of CORAL not only as a deductive database but also as a generic extensible database system. Mimsy is a stock market historical reporting system that can answer questions about daily stock market pricing data. The paper describes the Mimsy system, and issues related to its design and implementation.

Reference-contexts: While providing all the functionality of a logic programming environment, CORAL also provides the functionality of a general-purpose extensible database system [RSSS93]. The system includes an interpreter capable of processing a declarative rule-based language and an imperative environment where CORAL can be accessed from within a host language (C++ <ref> [ES90] </ref>). This environment is geared toward the building of non-trivial database applications. Mimsy is a system for asking questions about stock market data, and has been built on top of CORAL. The goal is to provide an SQL-like language specifically geared toward the application of querying stock market data.

Reference-contexts: The cost of maintaining this generality often makes accessing stock market, and indeed all time-series, both space and time inefficient. Some Wall Street investment banks have even been known to use environments like APL <ref> [GR84, Ive62] </ref> that are geared toward dealing with vectors and matrices, and eschew the use of RDBMSs completely. Since CORAL is a general purpose deductive database system, using the basic system would result in similar inefficiencies.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to provide an SQL-like language specifically geared toward the application of querying stock market data. Mimsy is inspired by a commercial application sold by Logical Information Machines, Inc., called MIM 1 <ref> [Lew92] </ref> 2 . Like MIM, Mimsy allows the user to execute ad hoc queries against the stock market data. It should be noted that Mimsy is at once both more powerful and less powerful than MIM.

Reference-contexts: A command line interface is provided for interactive querying, and a graphical point-and-click interface for composing queries is also available. Utilities for sorting and graphing the results of queries are provided. This paper, however, focuses on the Mimsy language and implementation issues. The interface is described in detail in <ref> [Rot93] </ref>. The following points are worth emphasizing: 1. Mimsy can deal with significant amounts of data and quite complex queries, providing interactive responsive time. The recursive query capabilities of CORAL are necessary for expressing many natural concepts (e.g., a "bull market", "consecutive peaks", etc.) in this domain. 2. <p> These transformations handle date ranges, and boolean expressions. Optimizations to handle aggregates and REPEAT clauses are also performed. Finally, the CORAL code corresponding to the Mimsy query is generated and sent to the server. The details of the translation are fairly complex and are described in <ref> [Rot93] </ref>. 4 Series Data There are currently 10 base series each defined for 165 stocks going back 5 years. The data for these series comes from the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). <p> The extensibility features of CORAL are heavily utilized to ensure efficient performance. The design of the Mimsy system itself involved some interesting language issues and implementation decisions. While we have touched upon them briefly, they are discussed in detail in <ref> [Rot93] </ref>. The system is currently being extended to handle portfolio queries, requiring significant extensions both of the language and the implementation. 8 The experience of developing Mimsy offers evidence of the power of deductive systems.
