Abstract: Previous approaches to supporting video on packet-switched networks include deterministic service, statistical service, predicted service, and feedback-based schemes. These schemes represent different tradeoffs in quality of service (QOS), achievable network utilization, and method of dealing with overload. In this paper, we propose a new service called REnegotiated Deterministic Variable Bit Rate Service (RED-VBR) that attempts to strike an efficient balance with the above tradeoffs. The approach is based on deterministic guarantees with client controlled renegotiation of traffic and QOS parameters and graceful adaptation during overload periods. We introduce a connection admission control algorithm for RED-VBR which bounds the renegotiation failure probability. We evaluate the scheme using two traces of MPEG-compressed video and show that, even with simple renegotiation polices and relatively low renegotiation frequencies, high network utilization in the range of 50% to 80% can be achieved. For traffic that is bursty over long intervals, this represents a 100% to 150% improvement in network utilization compared to deterministic service. Compared to statistical and predicted service, our approach allows more graceful and client-controlled QOS degradation during overload period.

Reference-contexts: In [3], it has been shown that by optimizing the software, a two-order of magnitude performance gain can be achieved for a portion of the signaling software. Our experience with the Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite <ref> [1] </ref> indicates that the time to process a connection establishment message is around 2 msec on a DECstation 500/240 [2]. The bulk of this time is spent in overheads such as user-kernel crossing.

The bulk of this time is spent in overheads such as user-kernel crossing. The time to actually perform admission control tests and routing computation is relatively small (0.2 to 0.5 msec).

Reference-contexts: Most existing signaling systems have relatively low signaling throughputs. For example, our measurements show that a commercial ATM switch can process only about 50 connection establishment requests per second. However, the low throughputs are more an artifact of poor implementation than the intrinsic complexity of signaling. In <ref> [3] </ref>, it has been shown that by optimizing the software, a two-order of magnitude performance gain can be achieved for a portion of the signaling software.

Reference-contexts: Various solutions have been proposed to address the problem, and they represent different ways of dealing with the tradeoff between QOS and network utilization. Previous solutions can be classified according to the following four categories: deterministic service with worst-case resource allocation <ref> [4, 10, 21, 22] </ref>, statistical service with probabilistic allocation [8, 9, 16, 19, 23, 33], predicted service with observation-based admission control [6, 17], and feedback based scheme with no resource reservation [13, 18]. <p> [21] and [22] explore this tradeoff in different contexts, and these studies indicate that, under many conditions, more rate-interval pairs do not provide a significant utilization improvement. 5 2.2 Connection Admission Control for D-VBR (a) Advertisements (b) Action Movie Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 7, 25, 32] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, a CBR service is easier to implement than a D-VBR service. In another related work, the idea of using renegotiated service to support VBR video was independently proposed by Chong et. al. <ref> [5] </ref>. The focus of Chong's work is on renegotiation policies for live sources. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review a deterministic VBR service, which is the foundation for RED-VBR.

Reference-contexts: Correspondingly, resource allocation algorithms should have mechanisms at different time-scales to achieve a high statistical multiplexing gain. Second, most of the video compression algorithms have some type of quality control factor (Q-factor) <ref> [11, 29] </ref>. By tuning this factor, a video source can tradeoff its bit rate for perceptual quality. <p> The movie is digitized to 384 by 288 pixels and compressed at 24 frames per second with pattern IBBPBBPBBPBB. Both sequences were compressed using constant-quality MPEG 1 compression performed in software (see <ref> [11] </ref> for details of the MPEG compression algorithm). Plotting the bounding rate R k vs. interval length I k , the figure shows that the D-BIND model captures the sources' burstiness over multiple interval lengths.

Reference-contexts: We utilize two important properties of compressed video. First, compressed video traffic usually exhibits burstiness over multiple time-scales <ref> [12, 24, 27] </ref>. At least two levels of burstiness are important for a resource allocation algorithm: burstiness on a shorter time scale due to the coding algorithm and small-time-scale variations in picture information content, and burstiness on a longer time scale due to scene changes. <p> Thus, "heavy-tails" that may be found in a stationary bit-rate distribution (e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>) are unlikely to occur in this scenario.

Reference-contexts: If the bounding rates in the worst-case segment are significantly above the long-term average rate (as for the sequences shown above), low utilization may occur. This measure of "burstiness" is formalized in <ref> [20] </ref>. In order to achieve higher utilization for such bursty streams, some statistical multiplexing has to be introduced. <p> This curve, also depicted in Figure 2, shows that because 16 (a) Advertisements (b) Action Movie of the worst-case nature of the D-VBR guarantee (no packets will be dropped or violate their delay bound) and the burstiness of these video sequences (especially with the "burstiness" definition in <ref> [20] </ref>), the achievable utilization for deterministic service is limited to approximately 27% for delay bounds under 100 msec. Alternatively, with RED-VBR, significant improvements in network utilization are possible.

Reference-contexts: We utilize two important properties of compressed video. First, compressed video traffic usually exhibits burstiness over multiple time-scales <ref> [12, 24, 27] </ref>. At least two levels of burstiness are important for a resource allocation algorithm: burstiness on a shorter time scale due to the coding algorithm and small-time-scale variations in picture information content, and burstiness on a longer time scale due to scene changes.

Reference-contexts: Renegotiations are accomplished via the signaling mechanism such as the Dynamic Connection Management scheme in the Tenet Protocol Suite <ref> [28] </ref> or via an ATM signaling protocol in an ATM network. We name this scheme REnegotiated Deterministic Variable Bit Service or RED-VBR. RED-VBR can be better understood by considering the time-scales that are important for network control as shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: Correspondingly, resource allocation algorithms should have mechanisms at different time-scales to achieve a high statistical multiplexing gain. Second, most of the video compression algorithms have some type of quality control factor (Q-factor) <ref> [11, 29] </ref>. By tuning this factor, a video source can tradeoff its bit rate for perceptual quality.

Reference-contexts: We then use Equation (5) to convert this result to average utilization. Figure 2 then depicts 6 average utilization versus deterministic delay-bound for the two video sequences. Note that increasing the delay-bound also corresponds to a directly-proportional increase in the buffer requirement in the multiplexer (see, for example, <ref> [30] </ref>). Thus, points on the curve represent the maximum average multiplexer utilization that can be achieved when multiplexing homogeneous connections so that no packets are dropped or violate their delay bounds, even in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: Delay bounds for priority service disciplines that are more suitable for providing integrated services (e.g., Rate-Controlled Static Priority <ref> [31] </ref>) may be expressed in a similar manner [21].

Reference-contexts: [21] and [22] explore this tradeoff in different contexts, and these studies indicate that, under many conditions, more rate-interval pairs do not provide a significant utilization improvement. 5 2.2 Connection Admission Control for D-VBR (a) Advertisements (b) Action Movie Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 7, 25, 32] </ref>. These works show that the delay bound provided to a connection by a server is a function of the server speed and the traffic constraint functions of the all the connections sharing the server. This function varies with different service disciplines.

Reference-contexts: Previous solutions can be classified according to the following four categories: deterministic service with worst-case resource allocation [4, 10, 21, 22], statistical service with probabilistic allocation <ref> [8, 9, 16, 19, 23, 33] </ref>, predicted service with observation-based admission control [6, 17], and feedback based scheme with no resource reservation [13, 18]. Previously proposed solutions for deterministic service eliminate the occurrence of overload situations by reserving resources according to a worst-case scenario. <p> Thus, previous approaches to providing a statistical performance guarantee are based on a stochastic model of a source (e.g., <ref> [8, 9, 16, 19, 23, 33] </ref>) such as a Markov-modulated fluid source. However, such schemes require a priori knowledge of a source's statistical properties which may be difficult to obtain for "live" sources.

Reference-contexts: A new connection is admitted only if all existing connections and the new connection will receive their required delay bounds and blocking probabilities. The recent work on RCBR [14, 15], published in parallel with RED-VBR <ref> [34] </ref>, is closely related to our RED-VBR service.
