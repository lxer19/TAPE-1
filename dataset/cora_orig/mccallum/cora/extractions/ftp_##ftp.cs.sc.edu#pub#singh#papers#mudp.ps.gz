Abstract: In this paper we present our implementation of a modified UDP protocol appropriate for the mobile networking environment. Our protocol, like UDP, does not guarantee reliable delivery of datagrams. However, unlike UDP, it does ensure that the number of lost datagrams is kept small. In this paper we discuss our implementation of M-UDP (in NetBSD) and compare its performance against that of UDP in an experimental mobile network that is currently under development at the University of South

Reference-contexts: Consider the case where the mobile user is stationary but the wireless link is noisy (lots of lost packets). In this case, since the timeout interval is large, the sender will not retransmit lost packets quickly enough resulting in poor throughput because the channel will be underutilized. Bakre <ref> [1] </ref> has proposed a different implementation of TCP called I-TCP (for Indirect-TCP) that addresses this efficiency issue.

Reference-contexts: How can we maintain connections for users who are mobile? Clearly, we need to ensure that packets get routed to the current location of the user and we also need to ensure that the throughput of the connection is not adversely affected due to mobility. Mobile-IP <ref> [2] </ref> is an adequate protocol for routing packets in a mobile environment (section 2.1 discusses, briefly, how Mobile-IP fits into our system). However, Mobile-IP by itself cannot guarantee that the efficiency of transport connections is maintained.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss the implementation and performance of our M-UDP (Mobile-UDP) protocol which follows traditional UDP semantics but provides improved efficiency (i.e., fewer lost packets). The protocol is based on an idea similar to the one used in I-TCP and M-TCP <ref> [3] </ref>. That is, the UDP connection is split in two at some host close to the mobile user. This host attempts to use any free bandwidth to retransmit packets lost during a fade thus ensuring that the number of lost packets is kept small. <p> Mobile-IP with no modifications at 2 the transport level will be sufficient to handle this latter type of mobility. Our mobile network architecture is presented in detail in <ref> [3] </ref>. We summarize the main points in this section. Our architecture may be viewed as a three-level hierarchy (see Figure 1) at the lowest level of which are the MHs (Mobile Hosts) who communicate with MSS (Mobile Support Stations) nodes in each cell. <p> For a detailed explanation of our protocols and the functionality of the SH, please refer to Singh <ref> [3] </ref>. The mobility management module takes care of transferring transport connections when a mobile user moves into a cell controlled by another SH. The bandwidth management module allocates bandwidth to different connections in an effort to meet the negotiated QoS needs of the various MHs. <p> We have implemented M-UDP and tested its performance. The previous section shows that M-UDP performs very well in a mobile environment for a wide range of system parameters. M-UDP forms a part of our larger transport layer design that is discussed in Singh <ref> [3] </ref>. 16 MUDP Duplicate Sends (Standard Deviation = 0.05 * Mean) 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 Fade Interval (s) Copies per Pack et MUDP with MFC MUDP with SmFC MUDP with StFC MUDP Duplicate Receives (Standard Deviation = 0.05 * Mean) 1 1.02 1.04 1.06 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 Fade Interval

Reference-contexts: Significant transfer of state information (i.e., transport state) between SHs takes place only when a MH moves out of a cell belonging to one SH and into a cell belonging to another SH (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a transport state handoff protocol that runs between SHs in this case). However, observe that users tend to remain for significant amounts of time within a building or within some other small geographical area the number of such handoffs is therefore reduced.

Reference-contexts: How are packets routed from the SH to the MH's current MSS? The SH maintains a cache containing a mapping between the MH's temporary IP address and the IP address of its current MSS. Packets are then routed to the MH via the MSS using loose source routing (see <ref> [8] </ref>). The MSS transmits all packets it receives from the SH over its wireless channel. We have defined a set of transport layer protocols for mobile networks that are similar to protocols to be made available over high-speed networks. <p> The SH sends these (M-UDP) packets to the MH (another PC) via the MSS (which is another DecStation 5000 that serves as a router) using loose source routing (see Johnson <ref> [8] </ref>).

Thus, to emulate the transmission speed over the wireless link (from the DEC 5000 to the MH) and the fades we made the following modification at the SH.

Reference-contexts: In fact, if a SH controls n cells, the average number of handoffs per second that require 3 transfer of state information is of the order of n as opposed to n 2 which is the case if we do not use SHs (see Singh <ref> [10] </ref>). 3. From a security standpoint, centralizing complexity in the SH is a good idea because it is easier to protect SHs as opposed to protecting MSSs. <p> However, this data is discarded taking into consideration the structure of the data stream (e.g., compressed MPEG video or audio) and viewer perception. A discussion of LPTSL is beyond the scope of this paper and the interested reader is referred to Singh <ref> [10] </ref>. 3 Design of M-UDP Consider Figure 3. Packets arrive at the SH from some fixed host for delivery to the MH. As the MH moves about, it encounters periods of fade (as shown).
