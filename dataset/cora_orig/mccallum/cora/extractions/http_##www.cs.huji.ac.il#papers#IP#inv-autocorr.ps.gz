Title: ON THE COMPLEXITY OF INVERTING THE AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION OF A FINITE INTEGER SEQUENCE, AND THE
Author: Paul Lemke* and 
Keyword: unlabelled distances between pairs of points.  
Abstract: Michael Wermany Abstract. We show that a polynomial time algorithm exists to find all integer sequences with a given autocorrelation function, and we show that the same methods yield a polynomial bound on the number of different arrangements (up to translation and reflection) of n points on a line which generate a given multi-set of n
