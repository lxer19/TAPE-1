Abstract: This paper presents a topologically adaptable snakes model for image segmentation and object representation. The model is embedded in the framework of domain subdivision using simplicial decomposition. This framework extends the geometric and topological adaptability of snakes while retaining all of the features of traditional snakes, such as user interaction, and overcoming many of the limitations of traditional snakes. By superposing a simplicial grid over the image domain and using this grid to iteratively repa-rameterize the deforming snakes model, the model is able to flow into complex shapes, even shapes with significant protrusions or branches, and to dynamically change topology as necessitated by the data. Snakes can be created and can split into multiple parts or seamlessly merge into other snakes. The model can also be easily converted to and from the traditional parametric snakes model representation. We apply a 2D model to various synthetic and real images in order to segment objects with complicated shapes and topologies.

The elastic contour model is a discrete approximation to the traditional snakes model and retains all of the snake properties.

Reference-contexts: There are two main types of domain decomposition methods: non-simplicial and simplicial. Most nonsimplicial methods employ a regular tessellation of space. The marching cubes algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> is an example of this type. These methods are fast and easy to implement but they cannot be used to represent surfaces or contours unambiguously without the use of a disambiguation scheme.

Reference-contexts: Samadani [9] used a heuristic technique based on deformation energies to split and merge active contours. More recently, Malladi et al. <ref> [8] </ref> and Caselles et al. [2] independently developed a topology independent active contour scheme based on the modeling of propagating fronts with curvature dependent speeds, where the propagating front is viewed as an evolving level set of some implicitly defined function. <p> If the topology of an object is fixed and known a priori, such models are the most appropriate since they will provide greater constraint. Implicit models on the other hand, such as the formulation used in <ref> [8] </ref>, provide topological and geometric flexibility through their level sets. They are best suited to the recovery of objects with complex shapes and unknown topologies. Unfortunately, implicit models are not as convenient as parametric models in terms of mathematical formulation, for shape analysis and visualization, and for user interaction. <p> If the snake is initialized such that it surrounds the objects of interest and then is made to shrink and split around these objects, only the outer boundaries will be recovered. Conversely, to grow a snake from within each object requires prior knowledge of the objects. Malladi et al. <ref> [8] </ref> solved this initialization problem by using a two stage algorithm, capturing the outer boundaries in the first stage and the inner boundaries in the second stage. <p> Furthermore, our topologically adaptable snakes model has all of the functionality of the implicit level set techniques described in <ref> [8, 2] </ref>, but unlike these techniques it does not require any mathematical machinery beyond that of traditional snakes and retains their parametric formulation. This allows users to control and interact with the topologically adaptable model as they would with traditional snakes.

In our approach, similar to the that taken in <ref> [10] </ref>, we uniformly distribute a set of small circular snake seeds over the image domain. These snakes then progressively expand, shrink, merge, and/or split to recover larger and larger regions of each object, including both the inner and outer boundaries (Figs. 7a-f).
