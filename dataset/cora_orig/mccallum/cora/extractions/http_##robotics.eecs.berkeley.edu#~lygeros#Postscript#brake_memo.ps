Title: Is there a Question?

Note: To Brake or not to Brake?  
Abstract: The vehicle following problem in an automated highway is approached from the point of view of safety. In particular the situation where an intervehicle collision is unavoidable and the relative velocity at impact is what determines the safety of the situation is considered. It is shown, using tools from optimal control that braking as hard as possible is not the best possible strategy in all cases. More importantly, the assumption that the worst that can happen is that the vehicle ahead brakes as hard as possible may also be incorrect.

Reference-contexts: This last assumption allows us to deal with a stream of vehicles (possibly infinite) by considering only the interaction between any two vehicles. To guarantee that the system is safe under any condition, it is common to make a "malicious opponent" assumption <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Vehicle B is assumed to do its worst to jeopardize vehicle A, while vehicle A is trying to do its best to stay safe. <p> For example, it can be shown that vehicles can not join to form platoons (as required in [3] for example) under the no collision safety requirement. Thus, to allow higher throughputs, the safety requirement is often relaxed to include collisions with small relative velocity (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Is hard braking still the worst possible action for the leading vehicle and the best one for the trailing vehicle in the case where collisions do happen? This paper will try to address this question in detail, using ideas from optimal control. <p> Section 4 contains numerical examples that illustrate the results of Section 3.

Reference-contexts: This last assumption allows us to deal with a stream of vehicles (possibly infinite) by considering only the interaction between any two vehicles. To guarantee that the system is safe under any condition, it is common to make a "malicious opponent" assumption <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Vehicle B is assumed to do its worst to jeopardize vehicle A, while vehicle A is trying to do its best to stay safe. <p> In most cases it is assumed, without proof, that the worst possible action of the vehicle B is to brake as hard as possible while the best possible action for vehicle A is to do the same. In <ref> [2] </ref>, it was shown that this is indeed the case when the objective of vehicle A is to avoid a collision altogether and the initial conditions are such that it is capable of doing so. <p> We will focus our attention to the case where a collision is unavoidable. The conditions under which a collision can be avoided are fully investigated in <ref> [2] </ref>. The problem can be viewed as a two player zero sum game, one player being the action of vehicle A (u) and the other the action of vehicle B (d).

Reference-contexts: In some settings however this no collision requirement may be too strict, as it severely limits the throughput of the highway. For example, it can be shown that vehicles can not join to form platoons (as required in <ref> [3] </ref> for example) under the no collision safety requirement. Thus, to allow higher throughputs, the safety requirement is often relaxed to include collisions with small relative velocity (see [1]). <p> In the platooning scenario of <ref> [3] </ref> this is the situation for the leader of a platoon 3 The dynamics of the system are given by: _x = 6 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 7 5 2 6 4 1 0 7 7 u + 6 6 0 0 3 7 5

Reference-contexts: However, the results become very relevant when trying to verify the safety of controllers that have already been designed (see for example <ref> [10, 11] </ref>). Our analysis indicates that assuming that the worst that can happen is that the vehicle ahead decelerates as much as possible may lead to a mistaken "feeling of safety". To complete the analysis, more thorough numerical results are needed.
