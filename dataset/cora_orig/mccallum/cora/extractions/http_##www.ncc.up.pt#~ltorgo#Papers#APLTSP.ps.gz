Abstract: In this paper we present some work on trying to apply propositional learning systems to the problem of time series prediction. We describe the difficulties of trying to adapt classification systems to prediction problems. Some techniques to perform this adaptation are presented. These techniques are based on the introduction of new attributes that convey relevant information about the temporal behavior of a time
