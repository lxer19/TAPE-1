Abstract: In this paper we presented the integration of tools in the SPADE-1 process centered software engineering environment. In particular a mechanism that achieves both control integration and data-integration was described. By means of this mechanism, tools can be controlled at the service level via selectively multicasted messages and can share data (i.e., persistent objects stored in the O 2 OODBMS, in the case of SPADE-1). The process model has a strong control over tools, while tools can share the process data in a disciplined and controlled way. We believe that the availability of ICCM gives us the means to achieve nearly all the tool integration [1] S. Bandinelli, M. Braga, A. Fuggetta, and L. La-vazza.
