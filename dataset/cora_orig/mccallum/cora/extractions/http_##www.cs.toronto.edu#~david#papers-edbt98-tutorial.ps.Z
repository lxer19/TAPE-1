Abstract: Considerable effort in the database research is currently focused on the limitations of the classical relational model and on ways to overcome these limitations. The fruits of the research are slowly finding its place in the mainstream commercial systems, e.g., the object-relational or deductive extensions of SQL. Many of these extensions are also being incorporated in the new SQL standards. In this tutorial we concentrate on another way of extending the capabilities of the standard relational model: the temporal extensions that require an a-priori interpreted data type of (linearly) ordered time instants. We discuss the techniques used for efficiently incorporating temporal data into a relational system and describe the additional functionality needed to support these extensions. While the tutorial mainly concentrates on a single data type for representing time, the general techniques can be extended to other interpreted domains of data (e.g., spatial databases). We address the following issues: 2. The impact of general interpreted types on existing query languages. Mainly, we show that a careful choice of the basic operations leads to much cleaner and simpler languages while preserving (and often improving) the expressive power of the kitchen-sink based approaches 1 . All the above points are discussed in the setting of Temporal Databases and Temporal Query Languages. We briefly survey the classical results. However, the main emphasis is on recent developments in the area of temporal databases. In the light of several recent results [Abiteboul et al., 1996, Chomicki and Kuper, 1995, Chomicki et al., 1996, Kanellakis et al., 1995, Toman and Niwinski, 1996, Toman, 1996, Toman, 1997] many of the above issues have taken an unexpected turn and the correctness of several mainstream approaches has to be reevaluated.
