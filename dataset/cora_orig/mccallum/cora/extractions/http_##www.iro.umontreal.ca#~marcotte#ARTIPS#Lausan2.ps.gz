Abstract: This paper is concerned with the formulation of an equilibrium model where each agent's objective is a linear combination of two criteria, and the ratio of the weights associated with each criterion is continuously distributed across the population. I present several reformulations of that model in different variable spaces, some finite, some infinite. While the various reformulations possess quite different theoretical properties, a common numerical procedure for their solution can be worked out. Indeed this algorithm has a very natural relationship with a subproblem common to each reformulation of the model.

Reference-contexts: The (strict) convexity of g follows from the fact that the function OE 1 is (strictly) increasing. Note also that, if the density OE is differentiable, one obtains: 00 (v) = OE 0 (OE 1 (v)) 1 ; (53) which is nonnegative over the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and positive on the open interval (0; 1). 2 If one assumes furthermore that F is monotone, the variational inequality VI (J t Q; X) is monotone as well. <p> The optimal computation of the evaluation points ff i can be achieved via a dynamic programming algorithm that is reminiscent of the one proposed by Bellman and Dreyfus <ref> [1] </ref> for determining the optimal locations of points where to evaluate a convex function whose zero is sought.

This author worked with a density of the value-of-time parameter, which is the inverse of the parameter ff used in formulation (15).

As shown in <ref> [7] </ref>, the choice of a fixed number (less than twenty) equidistant values of ff yields solutions that are virtually indistinguishable from the solution obtained from an exact solution of the parametric linear program, and this at a much lower computational cost.

This assumption has important consequences. Indeed, as shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the variational inequality (15) be monotone. If F is a gradient mapping, it is also a necessary and sufficient for the variational inequality (15) to be reducible to the more tractable optimization form (16). <p> The differences among these formulations are however superficial. A natural approach to solving the bicriterion problem is to use the information provided by the linear program resulting from fixing the total flow vector x to its current value. As shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, the resulting algorithm achieves a linear rate of convergence whenever the quantities G i are distinct and the function F is strongly monotone over X.
