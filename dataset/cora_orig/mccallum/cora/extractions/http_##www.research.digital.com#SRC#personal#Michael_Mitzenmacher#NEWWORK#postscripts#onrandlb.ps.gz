Reference-contexts: Both Eager et al. and Zhou suggest that simple randomized load balancing schemes, based on choosing from a small subset of processors, perform extremely well. In another well-studied model, incoming customers join the shortest queue; see, for example, the work by Adan, van Houtum, and van der Wal <ref> [1] </ref> and by Adan, Wessels, and Zijm [2, 3] for results and further references. The shortest queue model appears more applicable to centralized systems, whereas the limited coordination enforced by our model corresponds nicely to models of distributed systems. <p> Theorem 6 [[27], Theorem 8] The expected time a customer spends in the limiting model of an initially empty supermarket system for d 2 converges as t ! 1 to T d ./ j P 1 d i d 1 , then for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, T d ./ c d .ln T 1 .// for some constant c d dependent only on d. <p> We shall drop the explicit dependence on t when the meaning is clear. For convenience, we shall consider only systems where s i .t / 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all t, and hence * i .t / 2 [ i ; 1 i ] for all t . This restriction simplifies the statements of our theorems and can easily be removed; however, all the systems described in this section meet this condition.

Reference-contexts: For example, Karp, Luby, and Meyer auf der Heide showed that using two hash functions instead of one could provide an exponential improvement in the maximum load of a hash bucket [13]; this idea was further developed and aanalyzed by Azar, Broder, Karlin, and Upfal <ref> [5] </ref>. Our work demonstrates that making two choices leads to a similar exponential improvement in the dynamic setting as well. The justification of the relationship between the finite and limiting systems relies on Kurtz's work on density dependent jump Markov processes [10, 19, 20, 21, 22]. <p> These results are remarkably similar to those for the static load balancing problem studied in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the effectiveness of this general approach has been noted recently in practical load balancing scenarios [30] as well as for load profiling in real-time systems <ref> [6] </ref>. Although our methodology has been successful for several models, there remain several open questions. We conjecture that the closed model and the weak threshold model converge exponentially, although a proof appears to require different techniques than given here.

Reference-contexts: It has long been known that in distributed systems, redistributing the workload through load balancing can lead to significant performance improvements, in terms of both the mean and standard deviation of the time jobs spend in the system (for example, see <ref> [7, 35] </ref>). Moreover, simple randomized schemes with low overhead have proven effective in simulations; however, analyzing such schemes is often difficult. In this paper, we provide new analyses for several dynamic randomized load balancing models. <p> balancing to several new settings, providing further evidence of the significance of this idea in the design of distributed systems. 1.1 Previous work Distributed load balancing strategies where individual customer decisions are based on information about a limited number of other processors have been studied analytically by Eager et al. <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref> and through trace-driven simulations by Zhou [35]. In fact, Eager et al. also use Markovian models for their analysis [7, 8, 9]; however, the authors derive their results assuming that the state of each queue is stochastically independent of the state of any other queue. <p> work Distributed load balancing strategies where individual customer decisions are based on information about a limited number of other processors have been studied analytically by Eager et al. <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref> and through trace-driven simulations by Zhou [35].

This approach is exact in the asymptotic limit as the number of queues grows to infinity. <p> Although threshold systems have been shown to perform well in practice <ref> [7, 18, 35] </ref>, our results distinguishing these two models are new. 5.1 Limiting systems We consider the limiting system for the weak threshold model. The rate at which a queue changes size depends on whether it has more or fewer than T customers. <p> For small thresholds, the behavior of this system is very similar to that of the supermarket system, as has been noted empirically previously in <ref> [7] </ref> and [35]. In fact, the strong threshold model is double exponentially decreasing. Lemma 12 The fixed point for the strong threshold model decreases doubly exponentially.

Reference-contexts: We focus on the example where the service time is a fixed constant. The approach we use is based on Erlang's method of stages, which we shall describe briefly here. For a more detailed explanation see <ref> [17, Sections 4.2 and 4.3] </ref>. We approximate the constant service time with a gamma distribution: a single service will consists of r stages of service, where each stage is exponentially distributed with mean 1=r .

Reference-contexts: Many of our techniques, however, generalize to more complex systems, such as systems where transferring a customer incurs a delay (see <ref> [24] </ref>). Moreover, 2 even the simple systems we study demonstrate remarkably interesting behavior. <p> This analysis suggests that as long as this approximate load information reflects server loads with some reasonable accuracy between updates, choosing from two servers should still perform quite well. (See also <ref> [24] </ref> for similar ideas in other scenarios.) 4.2 Closed models In the closed supermarket model, at each time step exactly one non-empty queue, chosen uniformly at random, completes service, and the customer is immediately recycled back into the system by again choosing the shortest of d random queues.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we provide new analyses for several dynamic randomized load balancing models. Unlike previous similar analyses, we do not assume that in equilibrium each server is stochastically independent from other servers. One example of the type of problem we consider, previously studied in <ref> [27] </ref>, is the following natural dy namic model: customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate n, where &lt; 1, at a collection of n servers. The service times for the customers are independent and exponentially distributed with mean 1. <p> As another example, service times might not be eponentially distributed, but constant, or given by another distribution. In this paper, we introduce new analyses for these and other variations. Our approach, following that of <ref> [27] </ref>, has two main components: * We define an idealized process, corresponding to a system with an infinite number of servers. <p> More details regarding the application of Kurtz's work these models can be found in [28]. This approach has been used similarly in several other works (for example, see <ref> [4, 11, 14, 15, 27, 31, 33, 34] </ref>). The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review the work of [27] by examining the limiting system for the supermarket model. This allows us to introduce the necessary terminology and keeps this paper essentially self-contained. <p> This approach has been used similarly in several other works (for example, see [4, 11, 14, 15, 27, 31, 33, 34]).

This allows us to introduce the necessary terminology and keeps this paper essentially self-contained. <p> We conclude with some final comments and open questions. The main points of Kurtz's work are summarized in an appendix for the interested reader. 3 2 The supermarket model In this section, we review results for the supermarket model from <ref> [27] </ref>. This review allows us to introduce the necessary terminology and methodology that we will use to study other systems. 2.1 The limiting system Recall the definition of the supermarket model: customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate n, where &lt; 1, at a collection of n FIFO servers. <p> In <ref> [27] </ref> it was shown that every trajectory of the limiting model of the supermarket system converges to the fixed point E D . i / of Lemma 1 in an appropriate metric. We review the main points here. In what follows we assume that d 2 unless otherwise specified. <p> A natural potential function to consider is D.t / D iD1 js i .t / i j, which measures the L 1 -distance (or Manhattan distance) between the two points. The potential function used in <ref> [27] </ref> is actually a weighted variant of this, namely 8.t/ D P 1 for suitably chosen weights w i . The supermarket system not only converges to its fixed point, but that it does so exponentially. <p> These results are remarkably similar to those for the static load balancing problem studied in [5]. Simulations verify that this behavior is apparent even in small systems; for example, see Figure 2. More details are given <ref> [27] </ref> or [28]. 3 Constant service times The assumptions underlying the supermarket model, namely that the arrival process is Poisson and that the service times are exponentially distributed, do not accurately describe many (and probably most) real systems, although they are useful because they lead to a simple Markovian system.

Reference-contexts: Extrapolating from our results, we believe that the paradigm of using load information from a small random sample of possible destinations will prove effective in many load balancing scenarios. Indeed, the effectiveness of this general approach has been noted recently in practical load balancing scenarios <ref> [30] </ref> as well as for load profiling in real-time systems [6]. Although our methodology has been successful for several models, there remain several open questions. We conjecture that the closed model and the weak threshold model converge exponentially, although a proof appears to require different techniques than given here.

(We note that to formally compare constant service 7 times with exponential service times with this approach requires technical arguments regarding changing the order in which the limits as n ! 1 and r ! 1 are taken; for example, see <ref> [31, Chapter 14] </ref>. We have not completed such a formal justification. However, the theorem below is the key step in the argument, and moreover it is interesting in its own right.) We consider the case of aware customers where service times have a gamma distribution corresponding to r stages.

We consider general systems governed by the equations ds i dt D f i .Es/ for i 1, with fixed point E D . i /. <p> Hence, regardless of the signs of the remaining * i , we find that the coefficient of the sum of the terms in * T C1 is also at most 0. For the weak threshold model, proving convergence to the fixed point appears possible using the technique of <ref> [33] </ref>, although their methods do not appear to provide bounds on the rate of covergence. (Note that stability does not imply convergence, nor does convergence imply our strong notion of stability, namely that the L 1 distance is non-increasing.) We can, however, show that the strong threshold model does converge exponentially.

Reference-contexts: It has long been known that in distributed systems, redistributing the workload through load balancing can lead to significant performance improvements, in terms of both the mean and standard deviation of the time jobs spend in the system (for example, see <ref> [7, 35] </ref>). Moreover, simple randomized schemes with low overhead have proven effective in simulations; however, analyzing such schemes is often difficult. In this paper, we provide new analyses for several dynamic randomized load balancing models. <p> the significance of this idea in the design of distributed systems. 1.1 Previous work Distributed load balancing strategies where individual customer decisions are based on information about a limited number of other processors have been studied analytically by Eager et al. [7, 8, 9] and through trace-driven simulations by Zhou <ref> [35] </ref>. In fact, Eager et al. also use Markovian models for their analysis [7, 8, 9]; however, the authors derive their results assuming that the state of each queue is stochastically independent of the state of any other queue. <p> Although threshold systems have been shown to perform well in practice <ref> [7, 18, 35] </ref>, our results distinguishing these two models are new. 5.1 Limiting systems We consider the limiting system for the weak threshold model. The rate at which a queue changes size depends on whether it has more or fewer than T customers. <p> For small thresholds, the behavior of this system is very similar to that of the supermarket system, as has been noted empirically previously in [7] and <ref> [35] </ref>. In fact, the strong threshold model is double exponentially decreasing. Lemma 12 The fixed point for the strong threshold model decreases doubly exponentially.
