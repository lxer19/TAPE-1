Abstract: A generalization of Reiter's default logic is proposed that provides an improved treatment of default reasoning with disjunctive information. The new system | the disjunctive default logic | is used in the paper to reexamine the "broken-hand" example of Poole. We also compare the expressive power of this approach with two other approaches which interpret disjunctive information within the standard default logic. Finally, we show that our semantics of disjunctive default logic is a generalization of the semantics of disjunctive and extended disjunctive databases.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we show that our semantics of disjunctive default logic is a generalization of the semantics of disjunctive databases and extended disjunctive databases proposed in <ref> [GL90a] </ref>. Disjunctive default logic can be extended even further to the language of modal logic. This approach makes proofs of some of our results simpler and more elegant. We introduce this modal extension of disjunctive default logic in Section 8. <p> defaults, then the classes of extensions for D and of minimal (with respect to inclusion) extensions for covers of D coincide. 7 RELATION TO DISJUNCTIVE DATABASES Disjunctive default logic with extensions as defined in Section 5 can be viewed as a generalization of the semantics for disjunctive databases proposed in <ref> [GL90a] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: where n; m; k 0, and a i , b i and c i are literals. (The word "extended" points to the fact that the literals can be negative.)

Reference-contexts: The first of the defaults (3) says: If it is consistent to assume lh-usable ^ :lh-broken; then infer lh-usable. This mode of reasoning is acceptable when all available information about lh-broken is "vivid" | expressed by one of the literals lh-broken, :lh-broken (see <ref> [Lev86] </ref>). The disjunction (5) suggests lh-broken only as a possibility. This does not make the opposite assumption inconsistent, although we do not want the default to be applicable when this disjunction is postulated.

Reference-contexts: This difficulty was also observed by Lin and Shoham in <ref> [LS90] </ref>.

They present there an example (Example 3.1 [LS90]) of a (modal) theory T , containing disjunctive information, and comment that no default theory exists that corresponds to T . This difference may seem inessential, because the set of theorems (sentences that belong to all extensions) may be the same in both cases. <p> Thus neither atom is a theorem, and Poole's paradox is eliminated. It is also easy to see that disjunctive default logic is exactly what is needed to properly represent the theory of Example 3.1 of <ref> [LS90] </ref>. 6 EXPRESSING DISJUNCTIVE INFORMATION BY STANDARD DEFAULTS As we mentioned earlier, defaults are assertions not only about a domain described by the underlying first-order language, but also about possible sets of beliefs concerning that domain.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we generalize the theory of default reasoning developed by Reiter [Rei80]. The generalization is motivated by a difficulty encountered in attempts to use defaults in the presence of disjunctive information <ref> [Poo89] </ref>. The difficulty has to do with the difference between a default theory with two extensions | one containing a sentence ff, the other a sentence fi | and the theory with a single extension, containing the disjunction ff _ fi. <p> the following theorem Theorem 2.3 A set of sentences E is an extension for a default theory D if and only if E is the minimal set E 0 closed under provability in propositional calculus and under the rules from D E . 3 POOLE'S EXAMPLE The following example from <ref> [Poo89] </ref> illustrates a difficulty that arises in some attempts to use Reiter's formalism in the presence of disjunctive information. By default, people's left arms are usable, but a person with a broken left arm is an exception, and similarly for the right arms.

Reference-contexts: By default, people's left arms are usable, but a person with a broken left arm is an exception, and similarly for the right arms. One way to express this in Reiter's notation is to use "semi-normal" defaults, in the spirit of <ref> [RC81] </ref>. Below, lh and rh stand for left hand and right hand, respectively. : lh-usable ^ :lh-broken lh-usable ; : rh-usable ^ :rh-broken rh-usable : If you have no additional information about my arms, you will conclude that they are usable.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we generalize the theory of default reasoning developed by Reiter <ref> [Rei80] </ref>. The generalization is motivated by a difficulty encountered in attempts to use defaults in the presence of disjunctive information [Poo89]. <p> Proofs of our results are gathered there, too. 2 DEFAULT THEORIES We begin with a brief review of Reiter's default logic restricted, for simplicity, to the case of quantifier-free defaults. This restriction allows us to disregard the process of Skolemization, involved in defining exten-sions in the general case; see <ref> [Rei80] </ref>, Section 7.1. A default is an expression of the form ff : fi 1 ; : : : ; fi m ; (1) where ff; fi 1 ; : : : ; fi m ; fl (m 0) are quantifier-free formulas. <p> The difference between disjunctive defaults and standard default with disjunctive consequents can be illustrated by the following example from <ref> [Rei80] </ref>.
