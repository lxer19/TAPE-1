Abstract: INTRODUCTION This paper summarizes the extended system configuration and functional services, and describes the required security services and specific protection mechanisms used to provide these services. As a separate task, we were asked to provide a mechanism for examining and verifying incoming mail and routing of validated mail for special handling. On the basis of the needs expressed by the users, TIS drew up the policies and assumptions that would affect how security was implemented. We did not try to quantify the

Reference-contexts: Email security using Privacy Enhanced Mail <ref> [1] </ref> software to provide a mechanism for examining and verifying incoming mail, based on valid digital signatures, and for identifying validated mail for special handling Data on mobile computers will be encrypted. SYSTEM OVERVIEW The prototype system provides protection for the campus network and its Internet and dial-up connections.

Reference-contexts: Challenge Response USER AUTHENTICATION 22 want dew hurl wavy otter stop We use authentication as defined by the National Computer Security Centers Red Book <ref> [2] </ref> as (1) to establish the validity of a claimed identity or (2) to provide protection against fraudulent transactions by establishing the validity of ... the individual .... Identification of a user is often accomplished on computers through the use of a user name and password pair.

Reference-contexts: The list generated by the computer gives sets of word pairs or numbers and a set of words associated with those numbers <ref> [3] </ref>. We recommend the mobile PC-based approach to response generation, if using this method, in which the response is generated only after the user types in his password to the program.

Reference-contexts: A PEM-based gateway and router is able to do this automatic checking and routing. SECURE ELECTRONIC MAIL To secure email, additional security measures are desirable, especially for official business. Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) <ref> [4] </ref> provides three essential features necessary for official business: Integrity: Any electronic data received via PEM can be shown to be the same data that was sent.

Reference-contexts: Staff members are targets for spying; information they carry or communicate is vulnerable to capture. The security policy is made to be changed with a change in risks or business (service) needs. Passwords transmitted over outside connections are vulnerable to capture. That which is not expressly permitted is prohibited. <ref> [5] </ref> The security perimeter must be designed to block everything, and services must be enabled on a case-by-case basis only after a careful assessment of need and risk. Any data transmitted over outside connections are vulnerable to capture. <p> This policy can be difficult to enforce. If the private network is loosely administered or decentralized, a single enterprising individual with a high speed dial-up modem can quickly arrange an Internet SLIP connection that can compromise the security of an entire network <ref> [5] </ref>. Point-to-point encryption: Encrypting routers or software allow for encryption of all IP packets between pairs of networks. The benefit of an encrypted link, beyond the obvious observation that no data is ever sent in the clear over untrusted paths, is that it allows the joining of network islands. <p> This design decision sets the general stance of the firewall, favoring either a higher degree of service or a higher degree of isolation. In either case, it is sometimes desirable to support proxy forwarders <ref> [5] </ref> on the firewall, to act as a gateway for specific applications such as FTP or the X Window System. <p> The TIS Firewall Toolkit is designed to be used in conjunction with router-based screening as extra security. To minimize risks, the services that are provided on the external machine (bastion host) <ref> [5] </ref> are sharply curtailed and each service is subjected to review. On the standard firewall configuration, the only services supported are DNS, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, TELNET (via proxy and forwarding servers), and user authentication. Other proxies such as Treeses X Window System proxy [6] can be added to this architecture.

A simple program that implements a skeleton of the SMTP protocol is presented on the SMTP port on the mail server.
