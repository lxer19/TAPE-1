Abstract: The Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) is a general purpose reasoning system that is particularly suited for use in domains in which there are predetermined procedures for handling the situations that might arise. We have just completed an implementation of PRS written in C++, which we call the University of Michigan Procedural Reasoning System (UM-PRS). In this paper, we show how UM-PRS provides a critical level of representation for robotic applications in unpredictable domains, because it allows robotic vehicles to pursue long-term goals by adopting pieces of relevant procedures depending on the changing context, rather than having to blindly follow a prearranged plan. Specifically, UM-PRS has been used to control a real outdoor vehicle that changes its behavior based on what it sees in its environment. In turn, this provides the substrate for coordinating multiple robotic vehicles, allowing them to represent joint procedures and to infer each others plans through observation.
