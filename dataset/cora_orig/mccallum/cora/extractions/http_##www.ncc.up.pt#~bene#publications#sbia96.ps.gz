Reference-contexts: This second part is focused on the analysis of the diverse aspects of the association of DiBeRT with a GIS. The main characteristics of a GIS are the storing, processing and analysis capabilities of the spatial and alphanumeric data representing a geographic area (see <ref> [Burrough, 1992] </ref>). On one hand, a GIS constitutes a resourceful geographic data bank, encapsulating the capabilities of a relational database management system (RDBMS) together with a spatial database, allowing the simultaneous representation of inter-related graphic entities and respective alphanumeric attributes.

Reference-contexts: In DiBeRT, the IS is a belief revision system composed of two modules: the problem solver and the assumption based truth maintenance system (ATMS) <ref> [de Kleer,1986] </ref>. The latter is responsible for maintaining the agent's IS knowledge base free of inconsistencies. The IS knowledge base is a production rule system. The rules and propositions of each agent can be of several types.

Reference-contexts: This paper is structured in two parts: (i) presentation of the developed distributed belief revision system, and (ii) discussion of its application to the environmental decision support field. Reasoning while maintaining the knowledge base's consistency in a distributed system presents many challenges (see <ref> [Huhns, 1991] </ref>). In a distributed system diverse levels of consistency occur: (i) when the sets of propositions of each one of the various agents are internally consistent the system is referred as ; (ii) when the reunion of these sets is consistent the system is classified as .

Reference-contexts: to accomplish the undergoing tasks (task sharing); (ii) provides voluntary help it sends, voluntarily, results relevant to the problem solving activity of the recipients (result sharing); (iii) performs belief revision over shared propositions it automatically resends to every agent with whom the revised proposition is shared the updated belief status <ref> [Malheiro, 1994] </ref>. The agent that starts a cooperative action is called organiser and the agent that Inclusion of External Beliefs Multiple Context Management Belief Revision organiser agent respondent agent proposition + belief status private propositions shared propositions responds to the is named the . <p> According to the different kinds and possible stages of the cooperative actions a high level communication protocol with adequate primitives was developed <ref> [Malheiro, 1994] </ref>. The data exchanged between agents contains beliefs. Typically, and since the beliefs are internally represented by nodes, a structure very similar to the node structure (proposition + label) would be expected for the exchanged data.

Reference-contexts: The actual representation of the adopted external propositions is based on the available ATMS functionalities <ref> [Malheiro, 1995] </ref>, and depends on the belief status of the external propositions: (i) is locally represented by an assumption node; (ii) is locally represented by an ordinary node without valid foundations (the contents of the node's label is the empty set).

Reference-contexts: knowledge base is fundamental to the characterisation * Local Representation of the External Propositions Belief Status Synthesis Criteria local consistency of the shared propositions global consistency of the shared propositions an externally believed proposition an externally unbelieved proposition believed to unbelieved unbelieved to believed of a distributed belief revision system <ref> [Malheiro, 1996] </ref>. The DiBeRT agents act in "good faith" and exchange messages using the direct message passing mechanism, thus guaranteeing, that the information received by a recipient agent is, not only, relevant for its activity, but also, truthful from the sender's perspective.

Reference-contexts: The belief revision of the shared propositions is accomplished by the shared propositions' owner agent. An agent, upon revising the belief status of a shared proposition, immediately communicates its updated belief status to every recipient with whom it is shared, guaranteeing the system's physical consistency (see <ref> [Mason, 1994] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The adopted multi-agent architecture is based on the architectural model proposed by the Esprit ARCHON project <ref> [Wittig, 1992] </ref>. The agents have a double layer architecture: the cooperation layer (CL) and the intelligent system (IS) layer. <p> The translation of the requests presented to the GIS into GIS commands will be executed by a Convergence Layer (CvL), according to ARCHON architecture proposal (see <ref> [Wittig, 1992] </ref>), turning DIBeRT into a heterogeneous multi-agent system. After a careful analysis of both proposals (the implementation of an interface software agent or the modelling of the GIS as a DiBeRT agent) the DiBeRT agent proposal was selected.
