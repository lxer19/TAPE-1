Abstract: to interpret results from discrete event Abstract This paper describes an approach to the interpretation of discrete event simulation results using machine learning techniques. The results of two simulators were processed as machine learning problems. In the experiments, the simulation results were interpreted by an attribute-based learning program Retis, and by an Inductive Learning Programming simulation
