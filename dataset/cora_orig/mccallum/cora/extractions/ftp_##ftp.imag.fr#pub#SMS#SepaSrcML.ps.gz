Abstract: Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank C. Jutten and J. Herault with whom we have many fruitful discussions and H.L. Nguyen Thi who has provided us with the speech data and also several referees who have carefully read our manuscript and suggested many improvements. Abstract In this paper we propose two methods for separating mixtures of independent sources without any precise knowledge of their probability distribution. They are obtained by considering a maximum likelihood solution corresponding to some given distributions of the sources and relaxing this assumption afterward. The first method is specially adapted to temporally independent non Gaussian sources and is based on the use of nonlinear separating functions. The second method is specially adapted to correlated sources with distinct spectra and is based on the use of linear separating filters. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the methods has been made. A simple procedure for choosing optimally the separating functions from a given linear space of functions is proposed. Further, in the second method, a simple implementation based on the simultaneous diagonalization of two symmetric matrices is provided. Finally, some numerical and simulation results are given illustrating the performance of the method and the good agreement between the experiments and the theory.

Reference-contexts: likelihood approach for temporally correlated sources 3.1 Derivation of the separation procedure A well known technique to decorrelate a stationary signal is to perform a Discrete Fourier Transform, which transforms X (1), : : : , X (T ) into d X k 1 T t=1 It is well known <ref> [1] </ref> that E [d X (k=T ) d T X (l=T )] ! 0 as T ! 1 as soon as k 6= l and E [d X (k=T ) d T X (k=T )] converge to the same limit as the spectral density of the process at k=T , the <p> Further, these random vectors are asymptotically Gaussian under mild assumptions <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Note that the direct method of section 4.3.3 does not need iteration and hence has a performance really independent of A Two situations are considered, in which the sources have the uniform distribution over <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and the bilateral exponential distribution, respectively. Figure 4 plots the square root of the product of the sample size T with the mean squares of ffi 12 and ffi 21 , versus T . <p> S 1 (t) = S 1 (t 1) 0:5 fl S 1 (t 2) + u 1 (t); S 2 (t) = 0:6 fl S 1 (t 2) + u 2 (t) where u 1 , u 2 are two independent sequences of independent random variables with uniform distribution over <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. We then applied both methods of sections 2 and 3 to separate them. As before, we shall take the non mixed signals as observations.

Reference-contexts: We shall see later that the method can be justified without it. To write down the likelihood, one needs the density functions of the sources, which is unknown in a blind context. For this reason and the inherent scaling ambiguity of the problem (see <ref> [2] </ref>, [19], we shall assume for the moment that these densities are known up to a scale factor. Thus, let the source S i (t) has density f i (=oe i )=oe i with f i known and oe i unknown.

But in factor analysis, both the factors (i.e. sources) and noises are assumed Gaussian and the adopted method is second order based and yields the factors loading (the matrix A) only up to an orthogonal rotation.
