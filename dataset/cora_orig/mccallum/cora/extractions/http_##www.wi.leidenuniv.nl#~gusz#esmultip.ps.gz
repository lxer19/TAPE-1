Abstract: An extension of evolution strategies to multi-parent recombination involving a variable number % of parents to create an offspring individual is proposed. The extension is experimentally evaluated on a number of test functions, including unimodal and multimodal functions of high dimensionality. Multi-parent diagonal crossover, uniform scanning crossover, and a multi-parent version of intermediary recombination are considered in the experiments. fl This report is available at http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~gusz/esmultip.ps.gz y gusz@wi.leidenuniv.nl z baeck@ls11.informatik.uni-dortmund.de

Reference-contexts: Certain idealistic variants of global intermediary and global discrete recombination (i.e., using parents), however, have been analysed and shown to yield a -fold speedup on convex objective functions when compared to no recombination <ref> [4] </ref>. It is not clear, however, how these results relate to the real implementations of discrete and intermediary recombinations and how they are affected by the parameter %.

Reference-contexts: This skewed initaliza-tion takes into account a recent result by Fogel and Beyer <ref> [9] </ref> stating that if the global optimum is located in the center of the search region covered by initializing the population uniformly at random, intermediary recombination generates offspring individuals which are essentially unbiased estimates of the global optimum with lower variance than offspring generated solely by Gaussian mutation.

Reference-contexts: One might argue that it is the very irregular character of the fitness landscape that does not allow recombination to exploit any implicit regularities in the sense of combining good `building blocks' from different parents. The correlation coefficient analysis of Manderick et al. <ref> [15] </ref> showed that the performance of (two-parent) crossover is inversely related to the correlation between the fitness of parent and offspring chromosomes. For an irregular landscape as the Fletcher-Powell function this correlation is low and our results show that Manderick's argument holds for multi-parent crossovers too. <p> The majority of the runs, however, still find the global optimum of this function, where starting in the almost totally flat region x i 2 <ref> [15; 30] </ref> implies a serious handicap for any kind of optimization algorithm.

Note that uniform scanning crossover corresponds directly to the generalization of discrete recombination (according to <ref> [20] </ref>). For % = 2 and % = , scanning crossover is equivalent to the well-known variants of local discrete and global discrete recombination. Likewise, the generalized intermediary recombination operator introduced here is equivalent to local intermediary recombination for % = 2 and global intermediary recombination for % = .
