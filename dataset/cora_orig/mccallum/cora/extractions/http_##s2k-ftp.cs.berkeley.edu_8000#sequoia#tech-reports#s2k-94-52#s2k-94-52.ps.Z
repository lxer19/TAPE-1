Title: An Intelligent Assistant for Creating Data Flow Visualization Networks

Abstract: Non-visualization experts, including most scientists, find visualization systems like AVS too difficult to use. One approach to assisting these end-users in doing interactive visualization is to embed the knowledge of visualization experts into an intelligent system. A prototype, called Tecate, of such a system has been developed as part of the Sequoia 2000 Project. In this system, a Planner makes use of expert knowledge stored in a Knowledge Base to create data-flow visualization programs. The Planner takes as input a description of the data to be visualized and an indication of the data analysis goals of an end-user. From this information, an AVS network script is produced that when executed, builds an appropriate visualization of the indicated data set. The networks so produced make use of both a restricted set of standard AVS modules and a collection of custom ones which operate on data structured as fiber bundles.

Reference-contexts: For example, a visualization should not map a data variable to color if precise measurements are intended since people generally are less accurate in determining quantitative values from color than spatial differences, say <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Task Specification Language Tecate's task specification language is designed to express tasks in a way that a scientist might describe a data analysis goal to a colleague. With this in mind, the task language is intended to be natural-like and to use the lexicon of a scientist.

Reference-contexts: lexicon of an end-user. fl This paper was presented at the 1994 AVS Users Conference held in Boston, Massachusetts May 2-4, 1994. 1 The balance of this paper describes a simple prototype for an intelligent visualization system called Tecate that has been developed as part of the Sequoia 2000 Project <ref> [6] </ref>. The heart of the system is a Planner which structures visualizations of data selected by an end-user. The inputs to the Planner consist of a description of the data that is to be visualized and a task specification outlining the data analysis goals of an end-user.

Reference-contexts: These transformational modules collectively represent an implementation of a fiber bundle calculus akin to the relational calculus that underlies the query languages of relational database management systems. The Visualization Planner Tecate's Visualization Planner is a CLOS <ref> [9] </ref> program which utilizes the inferencing capabilities of a knowledge representation system. The Planner produces an AVS data flow network that when executed, creates a visualization of a given data set. The Planner takes as input a data descriptor and a task specification.

Within this language, the particular class of fiber bundle is indicated as well as the structure, extent, and number of base and fiber space domains.
