Reference-contexts: Level-1 triggered events at 100 kHz rate are sifted further in higher levels of triggers implemented as software filters. We discuss here the level-1 calorimeter trigger <ref> [1] </ref> electronics, which is designed to use high-speed data paths to collect and share nearest neighbor information and perform simple algorithms in custom integrated circuits to identify signatures for high energy electrons, photons, neutrinos and jets. Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 17 February 1997 Fig. 1. <p> The trigger primitives system board received 10-bit energy data from six strips and transferred it to the processor board. It also received the output from the processor board and communicated with the data acquisition system. On the processor board three Philips L-Neuro 2.3 ASICs <ref> [1] </ref> were used to implement the fine-grain algorithm. The algorithm included summing the strips to obtain the total energy in the trigger tower, making strip pair sums, finding the maximum strip pair sum and comparing the maximum strip pair to the total energy to set the fine-grain ID.
