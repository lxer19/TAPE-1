Abstract: 26 November 1997 6.837 Computer Graphics Team 20 Final Report Abstract Basic human motion involves complex dynamics and kinematics. Even under the condition that no external force acts on the body, the high degree of freedom of the human body makes the underlying dynamics complex. To animate human motion in free fall, a simulation of the dynamics must be used to maintain realism. We present a method to simulate the dynamics of the human body in free fall and animate the simulation result. In the simulation, the equations dictating the angular momentum conservation are satisfied. The result is a procedure that illustrates the nuances of angular momentum conservation. To display the results of simulation in a graphically realistic manner, we use the RenderMan software to create a visual representation of the human body and a context scene in which the human exists. The final result is an animation that depicts a human body jumping off of a tall building.

Reference-contexts: The underlying equations supporting the dynamic simulation include the three dimensional parallel axis theorem and moment of inertia tensor equations for cylinders, rectangular solids, and spheres. These equations were obtained from lecture notes for T&AM 203 by A. Ruina. <ref> (Ruina 1994) </ref>, and the dynamics book, Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics (Williams 1996). As stated in the Achievements section, equations 5, 6 and 7 require the rotation rate of each limb component with respect to the trunk.
