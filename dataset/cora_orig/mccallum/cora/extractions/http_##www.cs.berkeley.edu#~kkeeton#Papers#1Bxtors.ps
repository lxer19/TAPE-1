Abstract: Conventional architectures have been developed with a transistor budget of a few hundred thousand and have evolved to designs of about 10 million transistors, achieving impressive performance. However, we believe that these architectures will not scale efficiently another hundredfold to utilize billion-transistor chips effectively. Here we introduce an alternative way of using the huge amount of real estate available on such a chip: integrating the processor and the main memory on the same die. We call this architecture IRAM, for Intelligent RAM. We claim that a vector microprocessor is an ideal architecture for an IRAM chip. We discuss some of its merits and present a potential IRAM implementation fabricated in a Gigabit DRAM process.
