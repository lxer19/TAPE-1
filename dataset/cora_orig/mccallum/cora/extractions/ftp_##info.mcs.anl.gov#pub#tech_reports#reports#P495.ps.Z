Abstract: Path-following techniques applied to a spectral approximation of the solution of the Navier-Stokes Equations have revealed the existence of a new class of solutions to the plane Couette flow problem.

Reference-contexts: Theoretically and numerically, all studies seem to imply linear stability of this laminar flow for all Reynolds numbers (see [6] <ref> [1] </ref>). The lack of bifurcations or other known solutions for plane Couette flow make the study of this transition difficult. In contrast, Taylor-Couette flow, the flow between infinitely long coaxial cylinders, bifurcates to other flows for large enough Reynolds numbers. <p> @ae 1 ( @ @V i ;(A.4) where ~ V ~ r = V ae @ae V @ + V i @i r 2 = ae @ae @ ) + ae 2 @ 2 + @i 2 : The domain is ae 2 [R 0 ; R 1 ]; 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>; i 2 [1; 1]; and boundary conditions are ~ V (R 0 ; ; i; o ) = V 0 ^ ; ~ V (R 1 ; ; i; o ) = V 1 ^ ;(A.5) where ^ is the unit vector in the direction.

Reference-contexts: The three-dimensional solutions bifurcating from the vortex solution look like wavy Taylor vortices in Taylor-Couette flow. The tumbling rate, ; can be decreased to zero while retaining the three-dimensional structure of the solutions. The use of Chebyshev polynomials and the path following techniques of H. B. Keller <ref> [2] </ref> provide better-resolved solutions and make it possible to find the minimum Reynolds number at which these solutions exist. This minimum Reynolds number (Re = 470) is about one third the Reynolds number at which the flow experimentally sustains turbulence.

Reference-contexts: For Reynolds numbers less than the transition number (Re &lt; Re t ) the flow becomes a laminar flow with the velocity depending only on the distance from each plate. Theoretically and numerically, all studies seem to imply linear stability of this laminar flow for all Reynolds numbers (see <ref> [6] </ref> [1]). The lack of bifurcations or other known solutions for plane Couette flow make the study of this transition difficult. In contrast, Taylor-Couette flow, the flow between infinitely long coaxial cylinders, bifurcates to other flows for large enough Reynolds numbers.

Reference-contexts: Plane Couette flow, the case of interest in this paper, is the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid between infinite parallel shearing plates. Experimentally, plane Couette flow sustains turbulence for large enough Reynolds number (Re &gt; Re t = 1440 40) (see <ref> [7] </ref>). For Reynolds numbers less than the transition number (Re &lt; Re t ) the flow becomes a laminar flow with the velocity depending only on the distance from each plate. <p> Discussion. Nagata [5] finds new solutions to the equations for plane Couette flow. By using a different approximation scheme in a primitive variable formulation and path-following techniques, these solutions are confirmed. Two criticisms of these solutions have been raised by experimenters <ref> [7] </ref>. The first criticism is of the resolution of Nagata's solutions; however, these solutions exist at relatively high resolutions (see Table 5.1).
