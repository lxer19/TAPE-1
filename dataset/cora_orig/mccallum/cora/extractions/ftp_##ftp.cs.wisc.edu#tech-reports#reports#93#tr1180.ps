Title: Convergence of Infeasible Interior-Point Algorithms from Arbitrary Starting Points  
Author: Stephen C. Billups and Michael C. Ferris 
Keyword: Complementarity problem and prove its convergence.  
Date: October, 1993  
Abstract: An important advantage of infeasible interior-point methods compared to feasible interior-point methods is their ability to be warm-started from approximate solutions. It is therefore important for the convergence theory of these algorithms not to depend on being able to alter the starting point. In two recent papers, Yin Zhang and Stephen Wright prove convergence results for some infeasible interior-point methods. Unfortunately, their analysis places a restriction on the starting point. It is easy to meet the restriction by altering the starting point, but this may take the point farther away from the solution, removing the advantage of warm-starting the algorithms. In this paper we extend Zhang and Wright's results to apply to arbitrary strictly positive starting points. We then present an algorithm for solving the Box-Constrained Linear

(HLCP) where M; N 2 IR nfin ; e; h 2 IR n ; X = diag (x); Y = diag (y); e <p> Hence, f! k g is bounded. We now turn our attention to a special case of (HLCP) and extend some global and local convergence results due to Wright using the technical lemmas proven above. 11 3 Wright's Algorithm for the Linear Complementarity Problem The linear complementarity problem (LCP) <ref> [CPS92] </ref> is defined as follows: Find (x; y) 2 IR n fi IR n such that y = M x h; (x; y) (0; 0); x &gt; y = 0: Note that this is a special case of (HLCP) with N = I.

Reference-contexts: A is the graph of a monotone operator. Assumption 2.2 F 6= ;, i.e., a feasible point exists. It is known that Assumptions 2.1-2.2 imply the existence of a solution (x fl ; y fl ) to (HLCP)(see <ref> [Gul92, Theorem 3.1] </ref>). It is also well-known that Assumption 2.1 is satisfied by linear programs, convex quadratic programs, and monotone linear complementarity problems. In addition to these two explicit assumptions, Zhang also makes an implicit assumption about the starting point.

In fact, Wright's algorithm is a special case of Zhang's Algorithm 1. <p> We now proceed to prove global Q-linear convergence of Wright's algorithm using only Assumptions 2.1-2.2. Note that since Wright's algorithm is a special case of Algorithm 1, Lemmas 2.4-2.7 are applicable for it.

We now turn our attention toward proving global Q-quadratic convergence. We shall need to use Wright's stronger assumptions 3.1-3.3. We first prove two lemmas which place bounds on the iterates (x k ; y k ). <p> ; 0 &lt; x k C 2 ; i = 1; 2; : : : ; n: The result is obtained by setting C 2 := C 2 max max 1 ; max 1 !

Corollary 3.10 Algorithm 3 has local Q-quadratic convergence. Proof Follows immediately from Theorem 3.9. 17 4 Algorithm for Box-Constrained LCP We now turn our attention to linear complementarity problems with more general constraints. In particular, we consider the box-constrained linear complementarity problem (BLCP).
