Reference-contexts: 0 Introduction In modern treatments of predicate calculus <ref> [2] </ref>, no mention is made of states or variables up until the point where substitution is introduced. There, suddenly, the abstraction that reigned before is cast to the winds, and a substitution is defined as the result of a textual replacement of variable names by expressions. <p> Throughout, we assume familiarity with predicate calculus as developed in <ref> [2] </ref>. In particular, bracketing denotes a special predicate transformer called `everywhere' that maps every predicate to a scalar. <p> In order to prove f 's universal disjunctivity, it suffices to prove f = f fl ; (3) since|loosely speaking| f 's conjunctivity is f fl 's disjunctivity (see Theorem 6.9 of <ref> [2] </ref>). <p> Proof of (ii))(i) From f 's universal conjunctivity it follows that there exists a predicate transformer g with [g:x ) y] j [x ) f:y] (4) AB48d/CSS184d 4 for all predicates x; y (see Theorem 11.1 of <ref> [2] </ref>). A correspondence of this kind is sometimes called a Galois connection [1]. <p> This observation, however, does not strengthen the theorem, because every universally conjunctive predicate transformer that is disjunctive over finite sets is also universally disjunctive. This was proved by Scholten [5], as a generalization of a theorem of Van der Woude <ref> [2, Theorem 6.25] </ref>. 2 The reader who is already convinced that (i) of Theorem 4 captures the notion of substitution may quit here. Others may wish to read on. End of scope of Postulate 2.

Reference-contexts: It is the purpose of this note to remedy this breach of style by proposing a new characterization of substitution, one that is meaningful also in point-free models and that is equivalent to the classical definition <ref> [3] </ref> wherever the latter is applicable. More precisely, we prove that a predicate transformer is a substitution according to the classical definition iff it is both universally conjunctive and universally disjunctive. <p> For variable v and state s, the result of function application s:v is traditionally called `the value of v in state s'. With the aid of Postulate 12, we can give a conventional definition of substitution; see, for instance, <ref> [3] </ref>. As usual, a structure is a function on the state space.

Reference-contexts: Functions mapping P into itself will be called point predicate transformers. 2 The definition of P makes sense in every model for the predicate calculus, but there exist models where P is the empty set <ref> [4, page 29] </ref>. In order to exclude such surprises, we introduce our first postulate. Postulate 2 [(9p : p 2 P : p)] : 2 The following lemma shows that now every predicate may be written as a disjunction of point predicates.
