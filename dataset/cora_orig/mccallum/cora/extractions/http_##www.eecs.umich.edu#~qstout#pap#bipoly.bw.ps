Abstract: Suppose we wish to estimate the mean of some polynomial function of random variables from two independent Bernoulli populations, the parameters of which, themselves, are modeled as independent beta random variables. It is assumed that the total sample size for the experiment is fixed, but that the number of experimental units observed from each population may be random. This problem arises, for example, when estimating the fault tolerance of a system by testing its components individually. Using a decision theoretic approach, we seek to minimize the Bayes risk that arises from using a squared error loss function. The Bayes estimator can be determined in a straightforward manner, so the problem of optimal estimation reduces, therefore, to a problem of optimal allocation of the samples between the two populations. This can be solved via dynamic programming. Similar programming techniques are utilized to evaluate properties of a number of ad hoc allocation strategies that might also be considered for use in this problem. Two sample polynomials are analyzed along with a number of examples indicating the effects of different prior parameter settings. The effects of differences between prior parameters used in the design and analysis stages of the experiment are also examined. For the polynomials considered, the adaptive strategies are found to be especially robust. We discuss computational techniques that facilitate such
