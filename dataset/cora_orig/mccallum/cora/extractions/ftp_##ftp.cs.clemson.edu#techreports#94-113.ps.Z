Abstract: Regression testing is a necessary but expensive maintenance activity aimed at showing that code has not been adversely affected by changes. A selective approach to regression testing reuses tests from an existing test suite to test a modified program. Many selective retest strategies have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare and evaluate these strategies, because they are based on different philosophies. This paper outlines the issues relevant to selective retest strategies, and uses these issues as the basis for a framework within which to evaluate the strategies. We illustrate the application of this framework by using it to evaluate existing selective retest approaches. The evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, and highlights the problems that future work in this area should address. Keywords: evaluation framework, regression testing, selective retest, software maintenance.
