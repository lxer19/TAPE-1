Abstract: We have begun to see the emergence of large-scale knowledge bases that house tens of thousands of facts encoded in expressive representational languages. The richness of these representations offer the promise of significantly improving the quality of natural language generation, but their representational complexity, scale, and task-independence pose great challenges to generators. We have designed, implemented, and empirically evaluated Fare, a functional realization system that exploits message specifications drawn from large-scale knowledge bases to create functional descriptions, which are expressions that encode both functional information (case assignment) and structural information (phrasal constituent embeddings). Given a message specification, Fare exploits lexical and grammatical annotations on knowledge base objects to construct functional descriptions, which are then converted to text by a surface generator. Two empirical studies|one with an explanation generator and one with a qualitative model builder|suggest that Fare is robust, efficient, expressive, and appropriate for a broad range of applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, the field of natural language generation has begun to mature very rapidly. In addition to encouraging results in the form of specific theories and mechanisms that address particular generation phenomena, the field has witnessed the appearance of sophisticated, generic surface realization systems <ref> [12, 2] </ref>. A parallel development in the knowledge representation community has been the emergence of large-scale knowledge bases (LSKBs) that house tens of thousands of facts encoded in expressive representational languages [14, 8]. <p> To this end, we have designed, implemented, and empirically evaluated Fare, 2 a functional realization system that exploits message specifications drawn from large-scale knowledge bases to create functional descriptions <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, which are expressions that encode both functional information (case assignments) and structural information (phrasal constituent embeddings). Given a message specification, Fare constructs functional descriptions, which are then converted to text by the Fuf surface generator [2, 3]. <p> that exploits message specifications drawn from large-scale knowledge bases to create functional descriptions <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, which are expressions that encode both functional information (case assignments) and structural information (phrasal constituent embeddings). Given a message specification, Fare constructs functional descriptions, which are then converted to text by the Fuf surface generator [2, 3]. We have conducted these investigations in the "laboratory" provided by the Biology Knowledge Base Project. The result of a seven year effort, the Biology Knowledge Base [14] is an immense, task-independent representation of more than 180,000 facts about botanical anatomy and physiology. <p> Given a message specification produced by a text planner, Fare uses its knowledge of case mappings, syntax, and lexical information to construct an FD, which it passes to Fuf, a unification-based surface generator <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. 4 Fare was developed with text planners that employ the Biology Knowledge Base [14], which contains more than 180,000 facts about botanical anatomy and physiology.

Reference-contexts: Fuf is accompanied by an extensive, portable English grammar, Surge (the largest "generation" grammar in existence), described by Elhadad as "the result of five years of intensive experimentation in grammar writing." Surge borrows the notions of feature structures and unification from functional unification grammars [7] and systems from systemic grammars <ref> [5] </ref>. The second knowledge source used by the functional realizer is a library of FD-Skeletons. An FD-Skeleton consists of (1) a collection of semantic tests for inclusion and modification of nested FDs, and (2) a template that encodes the deep structure represented by an FD.
