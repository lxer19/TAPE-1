Abstract: We describe a newly established research project called SoftLab in the area of computational science and computational engineering. The SoftLab project attempts to link physical laboratory experimentation with computer control and simulation to provide a virtual laboratory for computational science. We describe the overall project objectives and then introduce the three focus projects of SoftLab: Two Chemical Engineering SoftLabs (bioseparation and computational electronics) and a Mechanical Engineering SoftLab (computational mechanics). Preliminary results of our efforts are also described.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the translation of the high-level geometry representation into specific geometry instances is analogous to the translation of a high-level programming language into machine language. The core modeling engine is then the abstract machine, while the high-level Erep is the program. As explained in <ref> [2] </ref>, the analogy is in some respects inexact, but suggests the strong possiblity of federating different modelers, SoftLab - A Virtual Laboratory for Computational Science 12 and, in particular, would allow to overcome functional barriers such as the difficulty of integrating design and analysis.

Reference-contexts: This environment also allows the user to visualize the experimental data in various ways. On the simulation side, we have completely redesigned the //ELLPACK system <ref> [6] </ref> in order to support the diverse needs of interacting with experimental models. The new PDE solving system, called PDELab, is now being implemented and a first version of the user interface environment, PDEView, is operational.

Reference-contexts: Computational Chromotography and Biology Softlab: SoftBIOLab Chromatography is the process of separating components by passing a solution mixture through an absorbent column so that each component adsorbs to the surface differently than the others, and thus eludes at different times <ref> [17] </ref>. The process is used for a final purification of proteins, chemicals and biochemicals used for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical and food products, water treatment and many other bio-chemical processes. Chromatography of biological molecules is often quite complex, and many of the dynamic aspects are not well understood.

Reference-contexts: Once the instruments are physically connected to the workstation, we need to develop a software environment for setting up and controlling the experiment and for gathering results. We have implemented a prototype of this environment using the LabView <ref> [20] </ref> system. See Figure 3 for a view of the LabView interface for the bioseparation laboratory which allows us to set up some of the experiment parameters, control its workings and also to gather results via the PC.

Reference-contexts: The custom hardware in the PC is basically an analog-to-digital convertor card and the software (Maxima) provides convenient access to the data, including in the form of a file of numbers. On the simulation side, the bioseparation group has a custom implementation of a numerical simulator called VERSE <ref> [21] </ref> that solves the experiments model (partial differential) equations. Simulations are run on a Sun workstation and take on the order of hours to execute.
