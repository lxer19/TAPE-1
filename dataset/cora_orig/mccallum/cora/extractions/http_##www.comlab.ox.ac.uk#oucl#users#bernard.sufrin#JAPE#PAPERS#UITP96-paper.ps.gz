Title: User Interfaces for Generic Proof Assistants Part I: Interpreting Gestures  
Author: Bernard Sufrin Richard Bornat 
Date: April 3, 1998  
Abstract: JAPE is a generic proof editor which (amongst other things) offers the teacher, user, or logic designer the opportunity of constructing a direct manipulation interface for proofs. In part I of this paper we introduce JAPE, illustrate some aspects of proof development by direct manipulation, and describe some of the infrastructure provided for interpreting the gestures which users make at proofs. In part II we discuss the problem of displaying proofs at appropriate levels of abstraction, and describe the infrastructure JAPE provides for eliding proof steps from the display.'

Reference-contexts: Several specimen logics accompany the standard distribution of Jape <ref> [Bornat and Sufrin, 1996a] </ref>, and we have selected two of these logics to provide the setting for most of the discussion below.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 1 shows a partial proof in both tree and box forms. 2 We discuss the relationship between these two views in <ref> [Bornat and Sufrin, 1996b] </ref>. 3 Interpreting Gestures The user's side of the interaction is conducted by making gestures at JAPE: these are made by typing, by mouse-clicks, or by mouse-drags.

Reference-contexts: This support is discussed in part II of this paper [Bornat and Sufrin, 1996c]. During a proof, the user is shown a view of the proof tree; this can be literally tree-shaped, or more usefully presented in the boxed style pioneered by Fitch <ref> [Fitch, 1952] </ref>.
