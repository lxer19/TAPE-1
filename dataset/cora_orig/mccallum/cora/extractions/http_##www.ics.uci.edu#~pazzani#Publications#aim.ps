Title: Applying Machine Learning to an Alzheimer's Database 1

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) methods for classifying dementia status to improve accuracy over current dementia screening tools: the Blessed Orientation, Memory, and Concentration Exam (BOMC), and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). We apply six ML methods to a database of 578 patients and controls. The ML methods are applied in conjunction with these two tests and experimental results show a 15-20% increase in classification accuracy over applying either the BOMC, FAQ, or their combined cutoff criteria. These ML methods also provide simple comprendable criteria for diagnosing dementia status.

Reference-contexts: Naive Bayes (Duda & Hart, 1973) uses Bayes theorem to calculate, for an unseen example, the probability of each dementia class given the unseen example's attribute values and the prior probabilities obtained from the training sample. IB1 <ref> (Aha et al, 1991) </ref> is an instance-based learner which classifies an unseen example according to the closest example FOCL is a system that learns rules about classes. It learns a rule to describe a class and continues specializing the rule until it excludes examples from other classes.

Reference-contexts: We used the Machine Learning Library in C++ (Kohavi et al., 1994) to test ML methods (C4.5, C4.5 Rules, Naive Bayes, and IB1), plus FOCL (Pazzani & Kibler, 1992) and a new algorithm called PL <ref> (Datta & Kibler, 1995) </ref> on the Alzheimer's database. C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) learns a decision tree to classify dementia status based on the input data's attribute values. C4.5 recursively examines these attribute values to create groups of examples all belonging to the same dementia class.

Reference-contexts: C4.5 recursively examines these attribute values to create groups of examples all belonging to the same dementia class. The attributes chosen are then used to classify unseen examples. C4.5 Rules (Quinlan, 1993) simplifies C4.5's decision tree and converts it into a set of if-then rules.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Correctly diagnosing dementia is a complex problem that requires historical patient data, physical exams, cognitive testing, and laboratory tests. Unfortunately, often times patients' initial visits are to community physicians who frequently do not realize a problem exists <ref> (Hoffman, 1982) </ref> or misdiagnose the disease (O'Connor et al., 1993). This decreases the time to treat the disease which leads to difficulty when attempting to slow the progression of the disease or minimize behavioral effects. Dementia is defined as multiple cognitive impairments with loss of related functional skills without delirium.
