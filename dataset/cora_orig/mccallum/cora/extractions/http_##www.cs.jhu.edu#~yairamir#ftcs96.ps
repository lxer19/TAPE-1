Abstract: Traditionally, two basic methods have been used to evaluate quorum systems: the analytical approach, and simulation. This paper proposes a third, empirical approach. We collected 6 months' worth of connectivity and operability data of a system consisting of 14 real computers using a wide area group communication protocol. The system spanned two geographic sites and three different Internet segments. We developed a mechanism that merges the local views into a unified history of the events that took place, ordered according to an imaginary global clock. We then developed a tool called the Generic Quorum-system Evaluator (GQE), which evaluates the behavior of any given quorum system over the unified, real-life history. We compared fourteen dynamic and static quorum systems. We discovered that as predicted, dynamic quorum systems behave better than static systems. However we found that many assumptions taken by the traditional approaches are unjustified: crashes are strongly correlated, network partitions do occur, even within a single Internet segment, and we even detected a brief simultaneous crash of all the participating computers.

Reference-contexts: A Quorum System is a set system S that has the Intersection property: S " R 6= ? for all S; R 2 S. The sets of the system are called quorums. Many quorum systems which are based on combinatorial constructions appear in the literature, such as <ref> [25, 13, 1, 10, 35] </ref>. However all the systems with optimal availability (under the fully connected model, see Section 2.3.1) turn out to be defined by voting. Definition 2.2 Let v i be an integer vote assigned to processor i, and let V = i v i .

Reference-contexts: The WI segment is even more complex, connecting two Ethernet segments over an FDDI backbone. Our records show many intra-segments partitions which occurred according to this physical structure. 3.2. The Protocol As a wide area group communication mechanism, we used the Spread <ref> [2] </ref> reliable multicast tool. Spread is run as a daemon on each of the machines participating in the experiment, and is automatically activated when the machine boots. The Spread daemons are used to keep track of the membership lists of the dynamically changing connected network components.

Reference-contexts: Set systems with the intersection property are known as quorum systems, and the sets in such a system are called quorums. Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as data replication protocols (cf. <ref> [11, 17, 3, 23] </ref>), name servers (cf. [28]), mutual exclusion (cf. [36]), selective dissemination of information (cf. [39]), and distributed access control and signatures (cf. [30]). A protocol template based on quorum systems works as follows.

Reference-contexts: This leader time serves as a membership change identifier that is agreed upon by all the members in the connected component. The algorithm used by Spread to determine the membership is a version of the Transis membership algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>, modified to cope with the wide-area structure of a network which connects several local area broadcast domains. Like Transis and Totem, Spread makes use of the non-reliable multicast service inside the local Internet segments, when it is available. 3.3.

Reference-contexts: The Spread daemons are used to keep track of the membership lists of the dynamically changing connected network components.

This model defines consistent semantics for services across all the daemons in a system that is prone to network partitions and processor crashes. Each Spread daemon logs three kinds of records to a local file: B (boot), A (active), and M (membership change).

Reference-contexts: Usually, assumptions such as independent failures and perfect communication are made to render the problem tractable. The results of this approach are rigorous and definitive. Analyses of the availability (probability that a live quorum exists in the system), assuming a complete and fault free network, can be found in <ref> [8, 34, 12, 37, 7] </ref>. Analyses of the expected size of a connected component containing a quorum, and the availability on ring networks are [32, 19]. An analysis of the load can be found in [29, 18]. <p> If p &gt; 1=2 then [34, 12] show that a monarchy (primary site) system is optimal. Non-Uniform: The processors have different failure probabilities p i . Then <ref> [37, 7] </ref> show that the optimal availability quorum system is a voting system in which the votes depend on the failure probabilities p i as follows. If p i 1=2 for all i then a monarchy with the least fail-prone processor acting as king is optimal. <p> These are possible candidates to be optimal assuming that the network may partition along the segment borders. Finally, we calculated the aposteriori weights, based on the observed failure probabilities of Table 1, according to formula (1) and scaled up <ref> [7] </ref>. Using these weights we defined two systems, one using all the machines (Weight All), and the other confined to the WI segment (Weight WI). These systems are predicted to have optimal availability assuming a fully connected network with the non-uniform failure probabilities which we measured.

Analyses of the expected size of a connected component containing a quorum, and the availability on ring networks are [32, 19]. An analysis of the load can be found in [29, 18]. <p> A basic notion in these measures is that of a live quorum: a quorum is called alive when all its processors are alive. The measures we consider are: UnAvail: This is the un-availability of the system <ref> [8] </ref>, the probability of the event that no live quorum exists in the system. When such an event occurs the service is completely halted. The un-availability is widely accepted as the measure by which quorum systems are evaluated. <p> Therefore in such a model the network is never partitioned into disconnected components. Within this model there are two sub-models: Uniform: The processors fail with the same, fixed probability p. If p &lt; 1=2 then <ref> [8] </ref> shows that the the majority system (i.e., a voting system with v i = 1 for all processors) has optimal availability. If p &gt; 1=2 then [34, 12] show that a monarchy (primary site) system is optimal. Non-Uniform: The processors have different failure probabilities p i . <p> Therefore in such a model the network can partition into several disconnected components. In this model <ref> [8] </ref> show that the optimal availability quorum system is always contained within a single bi-connected component of the network, for any topology. For a ring topology [32, 19] give explicit optimal solutions. 2.3.3 Dynamic Quorums All the above mentioned optimal quorum systems are static. <p> This can be seen from the fact that quorum systems which are confined to one Internet segment have higher availability than those using all the machines (compare the UnAvail columns of Maj All and Maj WI in Figure 4). This behavior fits the predictions of <ref> [8] </ref> assuming that each segment is a fully connected sub-net and single links connect the segments (or at least the two geographic sites). 4.26 2.97 2.81 3.56 2.52 2.44 6.48 4.44 4.43 0 2 4 6 King HU King WI All Weigt All WI Weight WI UnAvail Avg UnAcc Worst UnAcc

Reference-contexts: Looking more closely at the network structure (see Figure 1), we can see that physical segments are in fact implemented using several lower level physical devices, allowing for more intricate failure patterns.

Reference-contexts: A more general type of system [16] is a dynamic one in which the quorums are defined adaptively over time (e.g., the vote of each processor may change). In <ref> [20] </ref> it is shown that dynamic voting has better availability than any static system, when the processors' time-to-failure and the time-to-repair have an exponential distribution (in addition to the independence assumptions) for fully connected networks. 3. Methods 3.1. <p> Dynamic Systems We have evaluated five dynamic quorum systems, all of which are variants of the Dynamic Linear Voting (DLV) <ref> [20] </ref>. According to this protocol, when the network configuration changes, e.g., due to a processor failure, a processor recovery, a network partition or a network re-merge, the (single, if any) network component which contains a quorum now defines the entire universe, until the next configuration change.

Reference-contexts: Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as data replication protocols (cf. [11, 17, 3, 23]), name servers (cf. [28]), mutual exclusion (cf. [36]), selective dissemination of information (cf. [39]), and distributed access control and signatures (cf. <ref> [30] </ref>). A protocol template based on quorum systems works as follows. In order to perform some action (update the database, say), the user selects a quorum and accesses all its elements.

Reference-contexts: Analyses of the availability (probability that a live quorum exists in the system), assuming a complete and fault free network, can be found in [8, 34, 12, 37, 7]. Analyses of the expected size of a connected component containing a quorum, and the availability on ring networks are <ref> [32, 19] </ref>. An analysis of the load can be found in [29, 18]. A queuing system analysis is [26]. * Simulation: In this approach (cf. [21, 14, 24]) a simulation model is constructed, and a simulation is run. This approach allows more complex models, which can not be analyzed completely. <p> Therefore in such a model the network can partition into several disconnected components. In this model [8] show that the optimal availability quorum system is always contained within a single bi-connected component of the network, for any topology. For a ring topology <ref> [32, 19] </ref> give explicit optimal solutions. 2.3.3 Dynamic Quorums All the above mentioned optimal quorum systems are static. A more general type of system [16] is a dynamic one in which the quorums are defined adaptively over time (e.g., the vote of each processor may change).

Reference-contexts: Protocols such as the Available Copy protocol [9, 15] rely on never incurring a partition, either for correctness or efficiency. In <ref> [33] </ref> it is argued that total failures or network partitions do not occur in practice, so the Available Copy protocol is a viable option. Our findings indicate that such protocols may experience partitions even on a single-segment modern network. Thus it is dangerous to ignore the possibility of such events.

An analysis of the load can be found in [29, 18]. <p> Within this model there are two sub-models: Uniform: The processors fail with the same, fixed probability p. If p &lt; 1=2 then [8] shows that the the majority system (i.e., a voting system with v i = 1 for all processors) has optimal availability. If p &gt; 1=2 then <ref> [34, 12] </ref> show that a monarchy (primary site) system is optimal. Non-Uniform: The processors have different failure probabilities p i . Then [37, 7] show that the optimal availability quorum system is a voting system in which the votes depend on the failure probabilities p i as follows.

Reference-contexts: A Quorum System is a set system S that has the Intersection property: S " R 6= ? for all S; R 2 S. The sets of the system are called quorums. Many quorum systems which are based on combinatorial constructions appear in the literature, such as <ref> [25, 13, 1, 10, 35] </ref>. However all the systems with optimal availability (under the fully connected model, see Section 2.3.1) turn out to be defined by voting. Definition 2.2 Let v i be an integer vote assigned to processor i, and let V = i v i .

However the improvement is small (less than 0.2%). This can be explained by the fact the computed weights are rather close in value.

An interesting point to note is that we even observed a 12 minute period of time during which all 14 machines were down simultaneously, an extremely rare event under the assumption of independence. This event is attributed to a long wide-area power failure that called for a total shutdown.
