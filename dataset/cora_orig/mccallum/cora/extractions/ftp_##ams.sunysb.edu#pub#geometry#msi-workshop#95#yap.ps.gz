Reference-contexts: In particular, we point out that dimensionless measures (d = 0) are somewhat implicit in many discussions of DT&M and their explicit introduction will solve several "puzzles" and "boundary effects issues" of DT&M. 3 Relative Roundness The second part of this talk describes some recent joint-work with Tom Sher-mer <ref> [1] </ref>. Given an object O, suppose we want to estimate its measure (O).
