Reference-contexts: A frame introduced by a predicator may be thought of as a conceptual unit which is evoked (or denoted) by the predicator and which gives the overall structure to the conceptual object expressed by a clause headed by that predicator <ref> (Fillmore 1982, 1985a) </ref>. The value of the arg attribute is a set whose members are the participants of the frame, often called 'slots' in the AI literature and for most practical purposes equivalent to the arguments of a predicate.

Reference-contexts: Arguments for the existence of a What's X doing Y? construction 4 Technically, constructs have feature structures at their nodes. Strictly speaking, feature structures do not admit of unspecified values <ref> (Fillmore and Kay 1995, ch. 2) </ref>. Consequently there are no unspecified values in the representations of constructs. Constructions, on the other hand, do permit unspecified values. We will speak of the featurestructure-like objects, possibly containing unspecified values, which occur in constructions but not in constructs as AVMs.

Kroch eds. </editor> <publisher> University of Chicago Press: Chicago. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: The conception of long distance dependency in CG differs from that of GB. Long distance dependencies are conceived in CG in a way rather like the notion of functional uncertainty in LFG <ref> (Kaplan and Zaenen 1989) </ref>, in that a long distance dependency is considered as obtaining, not between a constituent and a gap (an unoccupied site in the constituent structure where the 'displaced' constituent would otherwise occur), but rather between the constituent and an element which is not part of the consituent structure

Reference-contexts: CG is a monostratal system in which syntactic and semantic information are represented within a single feature structure (represented by an Attribute-Value Matrix or AVM) and which relies heavily on the operation of unification. 4 As such it bears strong structural similarities to Functional Unification Grammar <ref> (M. Kay 1983) </ref>, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al. 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 1982) and, particularly, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag 1994), among several others within the broad family of unification-based approaches (Shieber 1986).
