Abstract: Primarily used in military communications in the past, code division multiple access (CDMA) is recently found to be attractive for personal communications as well. As a large number of mobile hosts are supported within a cell and a wide range of services are provided, one of the most important issues in a CDMA personal communication network is how to control the uplink access to the shared wireless spectrum. In this paper, we address this issue in a realistic situation where the receiver-oriented transmission protocol is employed and the packet loss due to multiple access interference (MAI) cannot be ignored. A medium access control protocol for voice and data integration is proposed. It solves the problems of code assignment and MAI control at the same time. A Markov chain model is used to analyze the protocol and the analytical results are shown to be very close to simulations. Based on the modeling, the effectiveness of the protocol's MAI control is demonstrated and some system design issues are investigated. fl Research reported herein was supported in part by U.S. Army Research Office under contract No. DAAL03-92-G-0184, and by Performance Analysis Lab of The Ohio State University.

Reference-contexts: As a large number of mobile hosts (MH) are supported within a cell, one of the most important issues in the system is how to control their uplink access to the shared wireless spectrum.

A transmission protocol is the rule that governs the selection of spreading sequence or code to use in the transmission of a packet [9]. <p> As to the second protocol, MHs can only share a limited number of codes in a cell, which are associated with receivers of the BS. The third protocol allows the use of only one common code in a cell. As argued in <ref> [6] </ref>, although the transmitter-oriented protocol incurs no collision, it is not a practical choice because a large number of codes are needed to support a small number of active MHs and a receiver is burdened with the task of searching the whole set of codes to decode incoming packets as a

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the common code protocol incurs too many collisions. Only the receiver-oriented protocol provides a good tradeoff between collision and receiver complexity. Two slotted ALOHA medium access control protocols for receiver-oriented CDMA PCNs have been proposed and analyzed by Liu et al <ref> [7] </ref>. However, they can only handle a single type of traffic where packets are subject to retransmission if lost but have no delay constraint. Future CDMA PCNs are expected to provide a wide range of services, including both voice services and data services such as file transfer. <p> We then use a Markov chain model to analyze its performance. In addition, we investigate how to set system design parameters for better performance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some relevant aspects of CDMA and the protocols proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. A new medium access control protocol for the voice and data integration is proposed and compared with other previously proposed protocols in Section 3. Section 4 presents a Markov chain model to analyze the proposed protocol. System performance is evaluated in Section 5. <p> The more the MHs transmit together, the higher the probability of bit error. A function P b (z) can be used to approximate the probability of bit error, where z is the number of MHs transmitting at the same time. 2.2 Previous Research In <ref> [7] </ref>, two slotted ALOHA random access protocols have been proposed and analyzed. These protocols are studied in a single micro-cell of a receiver-oriented DS-CDMA PCN. Since the size of the cell is very small, the acknowledgments from the BS are assumed to be received by MHs instantaneously. <p> On the other hand, the packets generated by a data MH are neither continuous nor delay sensitive. Thus the data MH will contend for a code whenever it has a packet to send, just like two previous protocols in <ref> [7] </ref>. To solve the second problem, we need to consider how voice packet loss occurs. <p> The voice and data transmission probabilities, p v and p d , were both chosen as 0.9 because as pointed out in <ref> [7] </ref>, a fixed retransmission probability of 0.9 could achieve near optimal performance. The impact of data traffic on the voice packet loss rate demonstrated the effectiveness of MAI control, as depicted in Figure 6. The system parameters K and C were set to 62 and 5, respectively.

Reference-contexts: This kind of loss is called the loss due to MAI. To control the loss due to contention, it is desirable to let voice MHs and data MHs contend in different code sets; otherwise, voice packet loss would be affected by the variation of data traffic <ref> [8] </ref>.

If two MHs within a cell use the same code to transmit a packet at the same time, the packet will be lost due to collision. There are mainly three transmission protocols, viz., transmitter-oriented, receiver-oriented and common code protocols. <p> Only the receiver which listens to this code can recover the bits from the symbols; other receivers perceive them as noise. It is important that two MHs should use different codes for transmission at the same time; otherwise, the receiver cannot distinguish them. For simplicity, the effect of capture <ref> [9] </ref> is not considered in this paper.

To derive system performance measures, stationary distributions of the variables should be found. To make the problem tractable, a Markov chain whose embedded point is at the slot boundary is considered. This Markov chain is ergodic since it is obviously irreducible, aperiodic and with finite states. <p> To make the problem tractable, a Markov chain whose embedded point is at the slot boundary is considered. This Markov chain is ergodic since it is obviously irreducible, aperiodic and with finite states. However, directly solving this three-dimension Markov chain is very difficult.

Voice and data MHs do not contend in the same code set. 2. Packets may be lost due to not only contention but MAI as well. 3. <p> ; n b ; n s ) = (n r ; n b j n s )(n s ) (1) The method of calculating (n r ; n b j n s ) given in <ref> [10] </ref> cannot be applied to our protocol because it is different from the protocol of [10] in the following three aspects: 1.

Let L CT and L MAI be the number of voice packet loss per slot due to contention and MAI, respectively, and R the number of data packets correctly received per slot.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Primarily used in military communications over the last several decades, code division multiple access (CDMA) is recently found to be attractive for personal communications as well, mainly because of its efficient spectrum utilization and simple frequency planning <ref> [13] </ref>. In addition, CDMA systems enjoy other advantages such as soft handoff, graceful performance degradation and tighter security [4]. A second-generation system standard IS-95 [13] and a third-generation system testbed CODIT [1] have been proposed or built, which demonstrates the feasibility of applying CDMA technology to personal communications. <p> division multiple access (CDMA) is recently found to be attractive for personal communications as well, mainly because of its efficient spectrum utilization and simple frequency planning <ref> [13] </ref>.

In this section, we first summarize the major features of our new protocol and then compare it with the previously proposed ones. According to the description in Subsection 3.1, the major features of our new protocol are as follows. 1. <p> Voice traffic is admitted independent of data traffic. For data traffic, two models of MAI are considered, i.e., the threshold model and the graceful degradation model. Its admission policies depend on voice admission policies as well as the MAI models. In <ref> [14] </ref>, CDMA and TDMA methods are compared in an integrated PCN. Its CDMA protocol allows completely unconstrained transmission of voice and data packets. As an enhancement to this protocol, Capone and Merakos propose an integration protocol to control data traffic [3]. <p> In [12], the reservation code multiple-access protocol is proposed for voice and data users to share a limited number of codes on a contention basis. These protocols are compared with our protocol as follows. Slotted systems are considered in [2, 11, 12, 15] but not in <ref> [3, 14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These problems are considered separately in the previous research: the first one is address in [12] while the second one in <ref> [2, 3, 11, 15] </ref>. However, in a realistic situation where the receiver-oriented protocol is employed and the packet loss due to interference cannot be ignored, they should be addressed at the same time. Thus we propose in this paper a medium access control protocol that considers both problems. <p> a rule that if there are M codes left out of S rsv , min (M; C) of them are put into S vc , where C is a predefined system parameter. 3.2 Comparison with Previous Integration Protocols As mentioned in Section 1, some integration protocols have already been proposed <ref> [2, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15] </ref>.
