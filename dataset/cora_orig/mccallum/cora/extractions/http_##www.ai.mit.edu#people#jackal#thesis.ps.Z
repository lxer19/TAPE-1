Abstract: This thesis is about the perception of texture similarity and the procedures underlying its computation. A model of texture similarity was engineered using a collection of simulated early-visual operations. These operations include oriented, multi-scale linear filtering; rectifying non-linearity; divisive normalization; low-order stochastic modeling; recursive cascading; and whitening. The first aim of this thesis was to illuminate the gap between these low-level operations and high-level judgements of perceived texture similarity in humans. The second aim was to assess the merits and limitations of early-visual operations as a practical basis for image retrieval. A taxonomy of early-visual models were used to retrieve natural textures from the Brodatz database. The fraction of correct textures found versus the total textures retrieved was used as an objective performance criterion. The most accurate early-visual model achieved a recall accuracy on par with the best known SAR [29] model, dramatically outperforming benchmark models by Haralick [15], Tamura [43], and Kabir [23]. In addition, early-visual texture models exhibited very favorable cost/performance characteristics: one model attained a recall accuracy of 80% using only 8 floating-point numbers to represent each texture in the database.

Reference-contexts: This link between texture and early vision was forged over 30 years ago with the seminal work of Julesz [21] and Beck <ref> [1] </ref> on the effortless segregation of micro-patterns. Since then, a number of other experimental approaches, including both cognitive neuroscience and the psychology of visual search, have offered us glimpses at the early-visual machinery. <p> For example, the time it takes for a subject to search for a target defined purely by orientation is independent of the number of distractors [46]. In addition, orientation and size strongly determine the perceptual grouping of several classical micropatterns <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. One focus of this thesis will be to determine the stability of oriented, multi-scale features as anchors for the computation of textural similarity. 2.2 Non-Linearity The responses of cortical cells are fundamentally non-linear.

One focus of this thesis will be to measure the effects of noise on magnitude and energy based non-linearities. 2.3 Normalization There are two serious problems with the linear/energy model of striate cells presented so far. <p> In addition, using just these four projections of the stimulus keeps the representation compact, and has already demonstrated its utility by successfully accounting for a variety of classical texture segregation phenomena <ref> [4] </ref>. 3.1.2 Energy Mechanism There is strong support for the existence of an essential non-linearity following the underlying linear stage of simple and complex cortical cells. This thesis implements this non-linearity using a quadrature energy computation.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, the energy response of each cell in a small population is normalized by dividing its response by the total pooled energy of all cells in the population. This model reflects both the saturation of striate cells at high contrasts, and non-specific supression phenomena <ref> [5] </ref>. The normalized gain control model need not discard overall stimulus contrast. It simply separates this information from measures of how contrast is distributed across orientations. Put differently, the gain-control model recodes complex-cell outputs without loss of information.

The novel approach of this thesis trades expressiveness for compactness by coding space implicitly using cascades of simple features.

Reference-contexts: Unlike simple or complex cells, which are essentially sensitive to purely one di 9 mensional variations, it is believed that hypercomplex cells encode two dimensional features of the stimulus. One popular view holds that hypercomplex cells are the neural basis for computing curvature <ref> [11] </ref>, and in particular, are sensitive to corners and junctions. Such features are informative cues for recovering the ordinal relationships between occluding objects [13], and spatio-temporal variants of these cells may underly the perception of kinetic occlusion [31].

Reference-contexts: These features attained retrieval accuracies in excess of 80% on photomi-crographs, aerial imagery, and satellite photos. A detailed specification of Haralick's methods can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> Orientation 12 Model 5: End/Side Cascaded, Multi-Scale Orientation 60 Model 6: End/Side Cascaded, Normalized, Multi-Scale Orientation 72 Model 7: Model 6 with both Mean and Variance Based Features 144 4.4.1 Model 1: Simple Orientation The ROC for model 1, based on 4 simple orientation features, is compared against the Haralick <ref> [15] </ref> and Tamura [43] models in Figure 4.3. The legend at the lower right of this graph labels the plots, from top to bottom in order of relative performance. Model 1 dramatically outperforms the Haralick model by 30% at 10, 28% at 50, and 13% at 100 textures retrieved. <p> A useful empirical relationship is discovered between dimensions with low variance and the recall performance of whitened, early-visual models; systematically discarding dimensions with low variance after whitening simultaneously compresses the space and monotonically improves overall accuracy. The most accurate early-visual outperforms well-known models by Tamura [43] and <ref> [15] </ref>, and achieves objective performance within 2% of the best known SAR model. In addition, the early-visual models achieve very favorable cost/performance characteristics: the leanest model achieves an accuracy of 80% at 10 textures retrieved using only 8 numbers to represent each texture in the database.

Reference-contexts: One popular approach views the simple-cell response as the output of a purely linear stage followed by a rectifying non-linearity, and views the complex-cell response as the pooled sum of simple-cell outputs <ref> [17] </ref>. The underlying linearity of simple-cells and the presence of a half-squared nonlinearity have both been supported empirically. The linearity of simple-cells has been supported indirectly by comparing the discrepancies between simple-cell impulse and grating responses [40].

Reference-contexts: Representing two-dimensional spatial variations using factored one-dimensional operators is, in general, not sufficient to express all variations in arbitrary images [25].

As a first approximation, this thesis adopts a cascaded model as a proxy for more sophisticated second-order computations. 3.1.7 Summary To summarize, the representation process accepts a single image as input and produces a real-valued vector of features as output.

Reference-contexts: In groundbreaking work, anatomical evidence for these cells in monkey cortex was established by stimulating the retina with spots or patterns of light and charting the responses of single cells <ref> [20] </ref>. The results suggest that cells in the primary visual cortex appear in at least three varieties: simple, complex, and hypercomplex. Simple cells are sensitive to lines and step edges, and show sharply localized 'on' and 'off' regions in their receptive fields.

Reference-contexts: This conjecture was refuted by counterexamples that showed subjects could both segregate textures with the same local second-order distributions, and could not segregate textures with different second-order distributions <ref> [22] </ref>. Although Julesz's conjecture and its variants have not survived empirical scrutiny, his view that low-order statistics of the image intensity are strong determinants of texture perception continues to guide the field. Unfortunately, work on the statistical character of texture perception in humans has largely been limited to segregation phenomena.

Reference-contexts: For the model used in this thesis, Tamura's coarseness, contrast, and directionality features were whitened, and a euclidean metric was used to order the texture space.

First, the DTFT magnitude of each texture image in the database is computed and used in all subsequent processing, eliminating sensitivity to linear phase.

Although a categorical approach to texture similarity has much to recommend it, the link between these categories and the low-level features known to visual scientists has yet to be clarified. In particular, the hypothesis that these categories may be explainable through simple, early-visual processes has yet to be explored.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the existence of this underlying linear stage, modeling the non-linearity of simple-cells by half-wave rectifying and squaring the linear stage output has been supported by measuring the responses of simple-cells to compound <ref> [36] </ref> and counterphase [45] gratings. Complex cells can be thought of as operators that pool the responses of simple-cells into an aggregate energy measure. Energy is computed by summing the half-squared outputs of four simple-cells whose underlying linear receptive fields are phase shifted by multiples of 90 ffi .

In addition, the energy model successfully predicts the discriminability of certain micro-patterns used in classical texture segregation experiments [4].

Reference-contexts: In a compelling paper [48], Tversky argues that human judgements of similarity often violate the metric assumptions, and proposes an alternative to metric similarity based on feature sets. Supporting the categorical nature of texture perception, recent work <ref> [39] </ref> has identified three salient dimensions along which humans perceive natural textures: periodicity, directionality, and randomness. A computational approach to texture similarity based on early classification along these dimensions is the subject of active research [34]. <p> Rao <ref> [39] </ref> demonstrates that humans categorize Brodatz textures along the three orthogonal dimensions of periodicity, di-rectionality, and complexity. Working from this result, a simple psychophysical experiment was designed to gauge how humans judge texture similarity within these three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: The underlying linearity of simple-cells and the presence of a half-squared nonlinearity have both been supported empirically. The linearity of simple-cells has been supported indirectly by comparing the discrepancies between simple-cell impulse and grating responses <ref> [40] </ref>. Assuming the existence of this underlying linear stage, modeling the non-linearity of simple-cells by half-wave rectifying and squaring the linear stage output has been supported by measuring the responses of simple-cells to compound [36] and counterphase [45] gratings.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the completeness of the pyramid representation implies that the original stimulus can be reconstructed from its sub-bands, a generic property thought to underly visual representations.

Choosing 45 ffi and 135 ffi orientations allows circles and lines to be distinguished, since the mean projections of a circle and a line at 45 ffi will look the same when projected solely onto horizontal and vertical orientations.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the completeness of the pyramid representation implies that the original stimulus can be reconstructed from its sub-bands, a generic property thought to underly visual representations. In image processing, this recursive approach to image representation has become a powerful tool for image compression [41] and enhancement <ref> [42] </ref>. Several filter sets have been designed as models of early-visual processing [24, 6]. Key design criteria for these filter sets include negotiating the fundamental tradeoff between spatial and spatial-frequency localization, efficient tiling of the spatial frequency plane, and closely approximating the detailed receptive profiles of cortical cells. <p> This strategy is similar in spirit to pose-invariant object recognition by interpolation of view-based templates. Because of their computational efficiency, attractive localization properties, and self-invertibility, these 'steerable filters' are used as the initial linear filtering stage throughout this thesis. 13 Following the implementation described in <ref> [42] </ref>, an invertible steerable pyramid is shown in Figure 3.1. This pyramid filters in scale and orientation using a polar-separable kernel design. In radial frequency, the image stimulus is split into high-pass, band-pass, and low-pass bands.

Reference-contexts: Tamura's coarseness, contrast, and directionality features were powerful predictors of human judgements on the rank orderings of 16 representative textures. However, simple linear combina tions of Tamura's features were unsuccessfull at predicting nearest-neighbor similarity judgements. A thorough review of Tamura's work can be found in <ref> [43] </ref>. The version of Tamura's model used in this thesis represents each texture using 3 floating-point numbers: the coarseness, contrast, and directionality features of the texture. Coarseness is computed using a three stage procedure that essentially averages the spatial scale at which neighboring image patches vary the most. <p> 5: End/Side Cascaded, Multi-Scale Orientation 60 Model 6: End/Side Cascaded, Normalized, Multi-Scale Orientation 72 Model 7: Model 6 with both Mean and Variance Based Features 144 4.4.1 Model 1: Simple Orientation The ROC for model 1, based on 4 simple orientation features, is compared against the Haralick [15] and Tamura <ref> [43] </ref> models in Figure 4.3. The legend at the lower right of this graph labels the plots, from top to bottom in order of relative performance. Model 1 dramatically outperforms the Haralick model by 30% at 10, 28% at 50, and 13% at 100 textures retrieved. <p> A useful empirical relationship is discovered between dimensions with low variance and the recall performance of whitened, early-visual models; systematically discarding dimensions with low variance after whitening simultaneously compresses the space and monotonically improves overall accuracy. The most accurate early-visual outperforms well-known models by Tamura <ref> [43] </ref> and [15], and achieves objective performance within 2% of the best known SAR model. In addition, the early-visual models achieve very favorable cost/performance characteristics: the leanest model achieves an accuracy of 80% at 10 textures retrieved using only 8 numbers to represent each texture in the database.

Reference-contexts: In addition to neuroscientific data, the primacy of edges and blobs as features in early vision is supported by pre-attentive judgements. For example, the time it takes for a subject to search for a target defined purely by orientation is independent of the number of distractors <ref> [46] </ref>. In addition, orientation and size strongly determine the perceptual grouping of several classical micropatterns [1, 3]. One focus of this thesis will be to determine the stability of oriented, multi-scale features as anchors for the computation of textural similarity. 2.2 Non-Linearity The responses of cortical cells are fundamentally non-linear. <p> Such features are informative cues for recovering the ordinal relationships between occluding objects [13], and spatio-temporal variants of these cells may underly the perception of kinetic occlusion [31]. Visual search studies also support for the recovery of terminations and junctions at the pre-attentive level <ref> [46] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Dozens of vision researchers have also tried their hands at defining texture <ref> [47] </ref>, yet like Webster's attempt, these definitions seem either too broad to be useful, or too narrow to build upon. Although a satisfying definition of vision texture appears beyond our reach, we clearly recognize texture when we see it.
