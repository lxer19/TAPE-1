Abstract: This paper identifies performance degradation in wormhole routed k-ary n-cube networks due to limited number of router-to-processor consumption channels at each node. Many recent research in wormhole routing have advocated the advantages of adaptive routing and virtual channel flow control schemes to deliver better network performance. However, most of these results are based on infinite message consumption capacity leading to unrealistic design guidelines. This paper indicates that the advantages associated with these schemes can not be realized with limited consumption capacity. To alleviate such performance bottleneck, a new solution using multiple consumption channels is proposed. It is shown that wormhole networks with higher routing adaptivity, dimensionality, degree of hot-spot traffic, and number of virtual networks have to take advantage of multiple consumption channels to deliver better performance. The interplay between system topology, routing algorithm, number of virtual channels/networks, memory bandwidth, physical link bandwidth, and communication traffic is studied to derive an upper bound as well as the optimal number of consumption channels required for a system. Using the on-going technological trend, it is shown that wormhole-routed systems can use up to 2-6 consumption channels per node to deliver better system performance.

The results were based on experimentation on the deterministic wormhole routed Symult-2010 system and suggested using multiple consumption channels in future wormhole systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique, often referred to as wormhole routing, is becoming the trend in building parallel systems due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead [24]. Intel Paragon [20], Cray T3D <ref> [9] </ref>, Ncube, J-Machine [25], and Stanford DASH/FLASH [16] are representative systems falling into this category. In wormhole-switching technique, the flow of header flit triggers the movement of the remaining flits in a message. <p> The routers are interconnected as a 3x3 mesh. Each processor is connected to its router so that it can inject messages to other nodes and consume messages destined to it. Many current systems built in industry and academia, like Cray T3D <ref> [9] </ref>, Intel Paragon [20], and Stanford FLASH [17] employ wormhole-switched mesh/torus interconnection networks with 2D/3D organization. Let us analyze the typical router processor interface as shown in Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: For illustration purpose, we consider only two virtual channels (v = 2) on each physical link. Such minimum virtual channel requirement is necessary to provide either deterministic routing on tori [15] or fully-adaptive routing on meshes <ref> [10] </ref>. In wormhole routing the slowdown factor in propagation of a message depends on the slowest link along its path of traversal. With two virtual channels a message can share a link with at most another message, in which case, its speed is reduced to half its normal speed.

Figure 7 shows the virtual channels along one row of a bidirectional 5-ary 2-cube torus supporting minimal deadlock-free dimension-order routing <ref> [12] </ref> with two virtual channels (v = 2) per physical channel. With this routing, a message has to complete all its hops along dimension 0 before traveling along dimension 1. <p> choose the largest of these values and denote it by a parameter c 1 t;r to represent a tighter upper bound on number of consumption channels along a single dimension from topology and routing restrictions. 14 Table 2 summarizes the virtual channel usage characteristics of two routing algorithms: a) dimension-order <ref> [12] </ref> as discussed above and b) Duato's fully adaptive routing [15] on three different topologies. The last column in this table shows the maximum number of messages that can simultaneously enter a node from all dimensions for different topologies. <p> Number of virtual Number of messages that Number of messages that can Routing channels used per can simultaneously simultaneously enter a node Algorithm physical channel enter a node along from all dimensions (c t;r ) for torus (v) one dimension (c 1 t;r ) 2D torus 3D torus n-cube Dimension-order <ref> [12] </ref> 2 3 6 9 n Fully-Adaptive [15] 3 5 10 15 2n Binary hypercubes or n-cubes are special cases of k-ary n-cubes. Each dimension is restricted to exactly two nodes with no wrap-around connections. <p> Note that since the dimensionality, n, of a hypercube changes with system size, c t;r in hypercubes is a function of system size. This leads to: Theorem 1 For a k-ary n-cube system with a single virtual network and dimension-order routing <ref> [12] </ref>, a tighter upper bound on number of consumption channels per node is 3n. With fully-adaptive routing [15] this bound increases to 5n. For hypercube topology, the upper bounds for the two rout ing algorithms are n and 2n, respectively. <p> Deterministic <ref> [12] </ref> and fully-adaptive [15] routing schemes with variable number of virtual networks (n v = 1, 2, and 3) were used. Three different system configurations, 16x16 torus, 6x6x6 torus, and 8-cube, were examined. All systems were analyzed for three different traffic models: uniform traffic, hot-spot traffic, and all-to-one pattern.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is challenging to first determine the performance degradation resulting from limited consumption capacity and to then derive the required consumption capacity per node to take advantage of these schemes. Besides the above considerations, many parallel applications exhibit non-uniform traffic with hot-spots <ref> [13, 21, 34] </ref>, both in distributed-memory and distributed-shared-memory paradigms. Such traffic leads to more messages being destined towards some nodes in the system. Even with uniform traffic, at higher rate of communication, there is more probability that some nodes receive multiple messages during a small period of interval. <p> Let us denote this maximum achievable throughput as max . The saturation happens either at the consumption interface or at the network channels <ref> [13] </ref>. The saturation at the consumption interface can be due to limited number of consumption channels (c) or limited available memory bandwidth (B mem ). Assuming B mem to be high and a network with high bandwidth, we expect max to increase with c.

Reference-contexts: However, how many consumption channels are sufficient? In the worst case a maximum of 2nvn v messages may arrive simultaneously at a destination node indicating a maximum requirement of 2nvn v consumption channels. However, this number may be too large (36 for a 3D torus with fully-adaptive routing <ref> [14] </ref> and supporting 2 virtual lanes) to be implemented on a practical system. This makes it a challenging task to determine how many consumption channels are optimal or effective to provide best performance in a wormhole system.

Thus, after the header flit of a worm reaches its destination the movement of its subsequent flits in the network depends on the rate at which the message gets consumed. <p> It is to be noted that a message in a wormhole network may also get blocked at its source node due to limited number of injection channels <ref> [24] </ref>. Since the message-preparation time on current-generation systems is quite high and proportional to message length [26], the probability of a message from a node having completely left by the time a new message gets prepared to move is also expected to be high. <p> Most commonly used direct network topologies are meshes/tori belonging to the class of generalized k-ary n-cube interconnections <ref> [24] </ref>. These are n-dimensional grid structures with k 0 ; k 1 ; ; k n1 nodes along dimensions 0; 1; ; n 1, respectively. The values of k 0 ; k 1 ; ; k n1 may be same or different. <p> For ease of illustration, in this section, we consider a flit to take exactly one unit of time to travel across a channel. The no-contention latency of wormhole-routed message of length L traveling a distance D from source-router to destination-router is given by (L + D 1) <ref> [24] </ref>. We add two more hops to this expression: one over the injection channel at source node and the other over the consumption channel at destination node. This leads to the no-contention message latency as (L+D +1).

Reference-contexts: It is to be noted that a message in a wormhole network may also get blocked at its source node due to limited number of injection channels [24]. Since the message-preparation time on current-generation systems is quite high and proportional to message length <ref> [26] </ref>, the probability of a message from a node having completely left by the time a new message gets prepared to move is also expected to be high. Thus, having large number of injection channels seems to be of limited use.

Reference-contexts: This discussion can be summarized as: c opt = c t;r;n v ; if c min eff c min eff mem &lt; c t;r;n v (9) To derive representative values of c min mem in current and future systems, let us consider predictions made by Patterson <ref> [27] </ref> as shown in Table 3. The values of B phy shown in the table are in the range of 100 MBytes/sec to 800MBytes/sec. These are derived from a combination of representative channel width and channel speed technologies.

Reference-contexts: For both types of traffic, if multiple messages reaching a destination node can not be consumed at full speed due to limited consumption capacity, they get blocked in the network surrounding the destination node. Such blocking can lead to tree-saturation <ref> [28] </ref> in the network which may affect the propagation of other hot and cold messages in the system. This has potential to degrade performance in terms of lower throughput and higher latency. The adaptive routing and VCFC schemes aim to achieve higher network performance by alleviating message blocking.

Reference-contexts: Such blocking besides leading to under-utilization of channels, may block other messages in the network. Though the wormhole-routing was initially proposed with deterministic routing [12, 8], a number of adaptive routing schemes have been proposed recently by many researchers <ref> [3, 6, 22, 23, 29] </ref> to reduce such message blocking in the network. Similarly, the use of multiple virtual networks (or lanes) with Virtual Channel Flow Control (VCFC) has been proposed [11] in literature to be used with either deterministic or adaptive routing.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the consumption channels are virtual in nature 3 . 3 Since consumption channels are always demand-multiplexed over the local bus, they are inherently virtual in 6 As discussed in the introduction section, over the years many attractive features like routing adaptivity [1, 5, 32], virtual channel flow control <ref> [11, 30] </ref>, and fault tolerance [4, 18, 19] have been proposed over the basic wormhole-routing. Future wormhole-systems are expected to incorporate these features into the design to increase system performance and usability. Most of these schemes primarily rely on having greater number of virtual channels.

Reference-contexts: This simulator is designed using CSIM <ref> [31] </ref>. It accurately models flit-level transfer corresponding to multiple virtual channels using demand multiplexing over a physical channel. It also models multiple consumption channels multiplexed over local memory bus and associated width matching buffers as discussed in Sec. 4.

Reference-contexts: However, such increase was not observed. As discussed in Sec. 5.2.1, for all-to-one pattern most messages enter from higher dimensions with dimension-order routing. With fully-adaptive routing we also observed that messages still tend to lump together on some dimensions <ref> [33] </ref>. Hence, with increase in dimensionality of hypercubes more consumption channels are not useful. c) It is also reassuring to observe that the values for c a2o t;r derived here are much smaller than the corresponding values of c t;r obtained in Table 2 in Sec. 5.1.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is challenging to first determine the performance degradation resulting from limited consumption capacity and to then derive the required consumption capacity per node to take advantage of these schemes. Besides the above considerations, many parallel applications exhibit non-uniform traffic with hot-spots <ref> [13, 21, 34] </ref>, both in distributed-memory and distributed-shared-memory paradigms. Such traffic leads to more messages being destined towards some nodes in the system. Even with uniform traffic, at higher rate of communication, there is more probability that some nodes receive multiple messages during a small period of interval.
