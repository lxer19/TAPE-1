Abstract: Clock routing has become a critical issue in the layout design of high-performance systems. We show that the two passes (bottom-up and top-down) of the DME algorithm [2, 3, 4, 8] can be replaced by a single top-down pass, which yields exactly the same (optimal) solution. From this, we develop a top-down algorithm which dynamically determines and embeds the clock tree topology, such that (i) the embedding is guaranteed to be planar, and (ii) the result has provably minimum total wirelength and minimum pathlength delay for that topology. A simple version of our method produces planar exact zero-skew solutions with total wire-lengths that are competitive with the best non-planar exact zero-skew results in the literature.

Reference-contexts: As described, Planar-DME uses very simple embedding and partitioning rules to guarantee planarity. Better partitioning strategies are possible, e.g., the splitting line can be changed to a splitting path of two or more line segments. Preliminary trials of such an approach are very promising <ref> [13] </ref>; improving the embedding rules seems harder and less promising than improving the partitioning rules. A second major extension of Planar-DME involves tree), illustrating the execution of Planar-DME. <p> The clock source locations are not given. Average cost savings over [15] are 15:5%. its applicability to more sophisticated delay models such as Elmore delay <ref> [13] </ref>. Our intuition is that top-down partitioning is more "global" than bottom-up methods: a top-down strategy can easily enforce planarity of the resulting solution, and is the logical candidate for extension into more sophisticated clock tree constructions.

Reference-contexts: If the skew of T (S) is zero then T (S) is a zero skew tree (ZST). As in fl Partial support for this work was provided by NSF MIP-9223740 and NSF MIP-9257982. related work on planar clock routing <ref> [15] </ref>, we address this problem in the context of the linear delay approximation: linear delay is simply the edge length, allowing geometric intuitions to be applied. In Section 5, we note extensions of our method to Elmore delay 1 . <p> Overview of Contribution Our work lies at the juncture of two recent directions in clock routing: (i) the DME (Deferred-Merge Embedding) algorithm of [2, 3, 4, 8] which embeds a given topology with guaranteed exact zero pathlength skew and minimum cost; and (ii) the method of <ref> [15] </ref>, which is the first to guarantee a planar-embeddable clock routing solution. We show that under the linear delay model, the two passes (bottom-up and top-down) of the DME algorithm can be replaced by a single top-down pass. <p> A very simple version of our method produces planar solutions with total wirelengths that are competitive with the best nonplanar exact zero-skew results in the literature [9, 4]. We also obtain an average of 15:5% wirelength savings over the previous planar routing algorithm of <ref> [15] </ref>. 2 Previous Work 2.1 Minimum-Cost Zero-Skew Trees The first clock tree construction for cell-based layouts with arbitrary sink locations was that of Jack-son et al. [11]; their MMM algorithm does recursive top-down partitioning of the set of sinks into two 1 Our work does not address such issues as buffer <p> Often, many vias must be introduced. This difficulty was first noted by Zhu and Dai <ref> [15] </ref>, who gave several reasons to seek a planar-embeddable clock routing solution. <p> Notice that "planar-embeddable" intuitively means that the tree can be drawn in the plane without edges crossing. However, this concept is not easily characterized in the Manhattan plane, and the previous work of <ref> [15] </ref> implicitly relies on Euclidean planar-embeddability being sufficient for Manhattan planar-embeddability. Thus, we define two tree edges as crossing each other precisely when the corresponding open line segments in the Euclidean plane properly intersect (i.e., share exactly one point). <p> Fig. 2 shows four sinks having an optimal "planar" clock tree whose edges pass over each other. Since this overlapping can be made planar with minimum increase in wirelength, we accept such a degenerate solution as planar. This is also the convention of <ref> [15] </ref>. c d P S 0 clk 2 1 P S 0 v "optimal, planar" ZST is inevitable; however, the ZST can be easily made into a non-overlapping solution. <p> Convex polygons P S 0 , P S 0 and P S 0 , and points p and v pertain to the discussion below concerning partitioning rules. The planar clock routing method of <ref> [15] </ref> is as follows. Start with a tree containing only a connection from the source node to the furthest sink. <p> An elegant analysis shows that this method always yields a planar-embeddable zero-skew solution with minimum possible source-sink pathlength. However, if we consider the simple case of four sinks at the corners of the unit square (with the source at the center), the method of <ref> [15] </ref> will create an "X" clock tree with cost = 4, while the optimal "H" solution has cost = 3. 3 The Planar-DME Algorithm Before describing our new planar clock routing algorithm, we need a little more terminology. <p> The worst-case and best-case time bounds are the same as those for the method of <ref> [15] </ref>. 3.2 Planar-DME The impact of Theorem 1 may not be immediately apparent, since DME can already accomplish the same construction in linear time. <p> The same seven examples as in <ref> [9, 4, 15] </ref> were studied. <p> Table 1 shows an average of 15:5% reduction in wirelength versus the previous method of <ref> [15] </ref>. Surprisingly, our planar solutions have lower cost than the non-planar solutions of KCR+DME for Primary1 and r5, and wirelengths are comparable to those of KCR+DME for the other test cases. Finally, Fig. 6 shows the planar clock routing solutions constructed by Planar-DME and the algorithm of [15] for the Primary <p> previous method of <ref> [15] </ref>.

Current work is investigating several areas of improvement for Planar-DME.
