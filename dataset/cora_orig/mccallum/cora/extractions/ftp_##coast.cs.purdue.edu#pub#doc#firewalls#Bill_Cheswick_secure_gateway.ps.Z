Reference-contexts: He installed a kernel modification that limited TCP connections from arpa to the inside network to smtp, uucp, named, and hostname ports. And he rejected the sendmail mailer as too complicated and dangerous: the Upas <ref> [1] </ref> mailer was installed in its place. We removed a number of non-essential daemons, including the finger server. To give insiders access to the Internet, a gate service was installed on arpa. Insiders could call this service and supply an Internet address.

Reference-contexts: Upas performs the mail gateway functions. 4. Inbound services We provide incoming login and mail service. For incoming file transfer, inet provides an anonymous FTP service. We do not trust our passwords to the Internet: it is too easy to eavesdrop or steal packets. See <ref> [4] </ref> for a discussion of these security problems. Login service requires a hand-held authenticator (HHA). These are calculator-sized devices that contain DES encryption and a manually-loaded 64-bit key. They cost about $50. Inbound login service is provided through an authentication manager on r70. A session is shown in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Protecting INET The preceding precautions might imply that we expect our gateway to be compromised at some point. In fact, we are taking great pains to protect the machine, including the usual good system administration steps needed to secure any Unix system <ref> [5] </ref>: directory and file permissions are checked, backups performed regularly, etc. We have taken some steps to avoid denial-of-service attacks. For example, the logs, the spool directory, and the publically-accessible FTP directory are each on separate file systems.

Reference-contexts: Howard Trickey implemented earlier versions of ptelnet and pftp. Dennis Ritchie has kept a watchful eye and stepped in when things broke. Steve Bellovin and others have provided numerous suggestions and warnings on various networking and security topics. Jim McKie ported many useful Research Unix <ref> [6] </ref> functions and the INCON Datakit driver to our MIPS computers, making life much easier for me.
