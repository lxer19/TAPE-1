Abstract: A mobility model and a bandwidth allocation scheme for multimedia calls in a cellular network are presented. The destination driven path (DDP) scheme guarantees the QoS requirements by predicting the path that the mobile unit will follow and pre-reserve bandwidth along the path. Bandwidth pre-reservation insures continuous service for multimedia traffic while the mobile unit moves from one cell to another. The mobility model, referred to as the most likely cell (MLC), is introduced with the derivation of the directional probabilities P ! i of the user's movements. DDP performance is presented in terms of the dropping ratio of hand-off calls and the blocking ratio of new calls.

Reference-contexts: In [4], packets sent to a mobile unit are multicast and buffered at the neighboring cells, so that when the mobile unit moves to a new cell there will be packets already waiting for it. In <ref> [1] </ref>, a pre-path establishment from the base stations in each cell in a cell cluster to the backbone network is used to facilitate the hand-off process. The DDP scheme proposed in this paper belongs to the third category.

Reference-contexts: For real-time services it is highly undesirable to drop a call in progress as opposed to rejecting a new call, if the network can not guarantee the QoS requirements of the call <ref> [2] </ref>. In order to guarantee continued support of the QoS requirements of hand-off calls, reservation of bandwidth before the hand-off actually occurs may be necessary. Several bandwidth pre-reservation policies may be considered.

Reference-contexts: In this section we formulate a mathematical model, refer to as most likely cell (MLC), to calculate these probabilities <ref> [3] </ref>. In our model each cell has k neighboring cells, as depicted in Figure 3. Consider an MU currently residing at cell c, the MU can move into any of the k possible neighboring cells.

Reference-contexts: The sub-rating channel assignment scheme (SRS)[7] creates a new channel for a failing hand-off call attempt by sub-rating an existing call's channel. The third category of schemes deals with methods that provide guaranteed services to real-time traffic. In <ref> [4] </ref>, packets sent to a mobile unit are multicast and buffered at the neighboring cells, so that when the mobile unit moves to a new cell there will be packets already waiting for it.

Reference-contexts: The second category of schemes aims at reducing the dropping probability of hand-off calls. The "guard channel" scheme gives higher priority to hand-off calls over new ones by reserving a number of channels in each cell exclusively for hand-off calls <ref> [5] </ref>. The "queueing of hand-off calls" scheme uses the fact that a mobile unit can communicate simultaneously with both current and next base station, to queue hand-off calls until bandwidth becomes available in the next cell's base station.

Reference-contexts: The first category of these schemes uses the distance between cells and the possibility of reusing the same channels in more than one cell as a criterion to allocate channels to calls <ref> [6] </ref>. Two schemes, FCA (Fixed Channel Allocation) and DCA (Dynamic Channel Allocation), are frequently used. The second category of schemes aims at reducing the dropping probability of hand-off calls.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Future personal communication networks (PCN) will evolve towards supporting a wide range of telecommunication applications, involving real-time multimedia traffic with varying quality of service (QoS) requirements <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to provide the higher capacity needed to support broadband services, future generations of wireless network architectures are likely to be micro/picocellular. These architectures overcome the radio spectrum limitation, but increase the hand-off rate from one cell to another.

Reference-contexts: The FIFO scheme gives higher priority to calls that arrive early in the queue. The measured-based priority scheme MBPS <ref> [9] </ref> selects the next call from the queue based on measurements of the received signal strength between the base station and the mobile unit. The sub-rating channel assignment scheme (SRS)[7] creates a new channel for a failing hand-off call attempt by sub-rating an existing call's channel.
