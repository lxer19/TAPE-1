Abstract: We consider a wavelength-routed optical network operated as a lightpath-based virtual topology. We present an exact linear programming formulation for the complete virtual topology design, including choice of constituent lightpaths, routes for these lightpaths, and intensity of packet flows through these lightpaths. By making a shift in the objective function to minimal hop distance and by relaxing the wavelength-continuity constraints (i.e., assuming wavelength converters at all nodes), we demonstrate that the entire optical network design problem can be linearized and hence solved optimally. The linear formulation can be used to design a balanced network, such that the utilizations of both transceivers and wavelengths are high, i.e., neither of these expensive resources are underutilized. We also use the linear formulation to provide a reconfiguration methodology in order to adapt the virtual topology to changing traffic conditions.

Reference-contexts: WDM will probably be orders of magnitude higher than those shown in Table 1, when costs for the electronics, other supporting optics (such as pre-amplifiers and signal equalizers), installation, and maintenance are also taken into account, e.g., see <ref> [1] </ref>. * Modify F (2) to F 0 (2) by adding the new constraint: 1 s;d fl sd i;j s;d ij = OP T 2 (19) This ensures that all the virtual topologies generated by F 0 (2) would be optimal with regard to the objec tive function. * The new

(See <ref> [2] </ref> for further details on these heuristics.) To ensure that the results from the heuristics are comparable with those from the optimization formulation, we do not impose wavelength-continuity constraints on the lightpath routing, although the heuristics can easily accommodate this feature without any sacrifice in their running time. * Maximizing Single-Hop <p> In this paper, we only consider equipment costs 5 . Our model of the WRS is based on the prototype used in the RACE project (see Fig. 3) [4]. For W 2 wavelengths, the cost of a wavelength-routed optical network, excluding fiber-layout cost, may be expressed as (see <ref> [2] </ref> for details) C = C t fi ( i X R i ) + C m fi (2M + i=1 T i e + j=1 R j e) + W C x ( m=1 where C t = cost of a transceiver, C m = cost of a multiplexer or

Reference-contexts: Some reconfiguration studies on optical networks have been reported before (e.g., see <ref> [5] </ref>); however, these studies assumed that the new virtual topology was known apriori, and were concerned with the cost and sequence of branch-exchange operations to transform the original virtual topology to the new virtual topology.

Also, previous results <ref> [6] </ref> indicate that queueing delays are negligibly small compared to propagation delays for a large network setting as in the NSFNET, except under extremely heavy loading. 2.1.2 Variables: * Virtual topology: The variable V ij denotes the number of lightpaths from node i to node j in the virtual topology. <p> This is a linear objec tive function because ( P P ij ) is a linear sum of variables, while P s;d fl sd is a constant for a given traf fic matrix. The two objective functions used in <ref> [6] </ref> were (a) minimization of the average packet delay over the network, and (b) minimization of the maximum traffic flow in a lightpath; both were nonlinear. 2.1.4 Constraints: * On virtual topology connection matrix V ij : X V ij T i 8i (2) i int V ij (4) The above <p> Adding wavelength-continuity constraints to the above set of equations significantly increases the complexity of the problem 2 <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. * Queueing delays are also intentionally ignored, partly to simplify (linearize) the objective function, and also because it has been observed that the propagation delay dominates the overall network delay in nationwide optical networks like the NSFNET [6]. * The number of variables and equations in the formulation are <p> set of equations significantly increases the complexity of the problem 2 [2, 6]. * Queueing delays are also intentionally ignored, partly to simplify (linearize) the objective function, and also because it has been observed that the propagation delay dominates the overall network delay in nationwide optical networks like the NSFNET <ref> [6] </ref>. * The number of variables and equations in the formulation are reduced. The number of variables and equations in the original problem formulation grows as O (N 4 ). To make the problem more tractable, we re duce the number of constraints by pruning the search space.
