Abstract: The bandwidth limitations of multimedia systems force tradeoffs between presentation data fidelity and real-time performance. For example, digital video is commonly encoded with lossy compression to reduce bandwidth and frames may be skipped during playback to maintain synchronization. These tradeoffs depend on device performance and physical data representations that are hidden by a database system. If a multimedia database is to support digital video and other continuous media data types, we argue that the database should provide a Quality of Service (QOS) interface to allow application control of presentation timing and information loss tradeoffs. This paper proposes a data model for continuous media that preserves device and physical data independence. We show how to define formal QOS constraints from a specification of ideal presentation outputs. Our definition enables meaningful requests for end-to-end service guarantees while leaving the database system free to optimize resource management. We propose one set of QOS parameters that constitute a complete model for presentation error and show how this error model extends the opportunities for resource optimization.

Reference-contexts: Performance guarantees are an essential feature of real-time systems, including time-based presentations. While best-effort approaches offer only weak guarantees for synchronization, strong QOS guarantees for continuous media presentations have been demonstrated through reservation of processor, memory, network and storage system resources <ref> [11, 19, 1, 9, 12, 3] </ref>. The resource reservations are derived from low-level QOS parameters such as throughput, delay and jitter requirements for stream processing. We call this a guaranteed-best approach when reservations are based on requirements for a best-quality presentation.

Reference-contexts: The most common multimedia presentation tools use a best-effort approach, which aggressively consumes resources to present all data as promptly as possible. When resources are overloaded, a best-effort presentation will lose information. Many researchers have demonstrated best-effort systems that maintain approximate synchronization despite variable latencies and resource availability <ref> [6, 13, 2] </ref>. These systems show that a presentation can be acceptable even when quality degradation is noticeable, but we observe two problems with a best-effort approach.

Reference-contexts: These constraints on delivery are an example of a QOS-based interface. None of the proposed data models for time-based multimedia that we are aware of support queries for imprecise results. For example, Gibbs describes a data model that captures the structure and synchronization relationships of complex time-based multimedia presentations <ref> [4] </ref>. This model includes media descriptors that attach a quality factor, such as "VHS quality" or "CD quality", to each media object, but these labels describe the quality of the representation rather than the presentation.

Reference-contexts: The resolution parameters are intended only to provide a few classes of service based on resource requirements and not to completely capture presentation quality requirements. Hutchinson et al. <ref> [5] </ref> suggest a framework of categories for high-level QOS specifications that include reliability, timeliness, volume, criticality, quality of perception and even cost. They provide only a partial list of QOS parameters to show that current QOS support in OSI and CCITT standards is severely limited.

Reference-contexts: Consider the reproduction of NTSC video in a digital multimedia system. The video stream is typically captured at 640x480 24-bit samples/frame and 30 frames/second, but it is rarely stored or played back at this bandwidth. Instead, lossy compression algorithms such as the MPEG encoding <ref> [7] </ref> are used to reduce the bandwidth requirements in exchange for some loss in quality.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia database systems are being extended to support presentations of continuous media <ref> [8] </ref>, such as video and audio, as well as synthetic compositions such as slide shows and computer-generated music.

However, our definition of QOS is novel in that we make strong distinctions between content, view, and quality specifications. A content specification defines a set of logical image and audio output values as a function of logical time.

Reference-contexts: Since user interaction and other extensions would not substantially change our definition of quality, we do not consider them further in this paper. We describe the data model using the Z specification language <ref> [14] </ref> in order to focus attention on the mathematical properties rather than on details of syntax and implementation. See the accompanying sidebar for an overview of Z notation. 5 Z notation We use a subset of the Z specification language as defined in The Z Reference Manual [14] and augmented with <p> Z specification language <ref> [14] </ref> in order to focus attention on the mathematical properties rather than on details of syntax and implementation. See the accompanying sidebar for an overview of Z notation. 5 Z notation We use a subset of the Z specification language as defined in The Z Reference Manual [14] and augmented with the standard arithmetic and calculus operators and relations defined over the set of real numbers. The example below shows a global declaration of a schema type S . A Z schema type consists of a signature of typed variables together with constraints on those variables.

Reference-contexts: This definition of presentation quality is then used to specify presentation-level QOS requirements. The second question can be answered by a variety of the techniques found in existing systems <ref> [15] </ref>. However, we argue that current systems take an ad hoc approach to presentation quality. Without a specification of presentation QOS requirements, multimedia systems have no way of saying whether a presentation is acceptable or not.

The resolution parameters are intended only to provide a few classes of service based on resource requirements and not to completely capture presentation quality requirements.

Reference-contexts: This paper defines a methodology for presentation QOS specification. The definitions are intended to be general enough to apply to presentations in any multimedia system. In particular, our methodology supports the following goals: * Model user perception of quality. Just as modern compression algorithms exploit knowledge of human perception <ref> [18] </ref>, a multimedia system can better optimize playback resources if it knows which optimizations have the least affect on perceived quality. * Formal semantics. We would like to be able to prove that multimedia system can satisfy a QOS specification. * Complex data model.
