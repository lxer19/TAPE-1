Abstract: Published as: F.C. Berger, A.H.M. ter Hofstede, and Th.P. van der Weide. Supporting Query by Navigation. Technical Report CSI-R9403, Computing Science Institute, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands, February 1994. Abstract In this paper we study hypertext systems from a very general point of view, and focus on monitoring the searcher's behaviour. The intention of this monitoring is to give a prediction of the estimation of the ultimate goal of the searcher, and an estimation of the searcher's determination in finding this goal. The latter might be negatively influenced by unfamiliarity of the searcher with either the information contents or the system. It is shown how these estimations can be used to support the searcher during the searching process. Furthermore, the derivation of a relevance function for documents is introduced, based on these estimations. An example is provided to motivate the approach chosen.

Reference-contexts: We will study this in the context of Information Retrieval in general and Hypertext (Hypermedia) systems in particular. The stratified architecture for Hypermedia applications (see <ref> [BW92] </ref>) models a hypermedia application by a number of layers. The basic layers are the hyperbase and the hyperindex (see figure 1). The hyperindex is an indexing structure for the actual information, which is contained in the hyperbase. <p> For the purposes of this paper, we assume that the characterization language has a structure, which can be exploited to structure the search space, i.e. the set of descriptors associated with documents in the Information Retrieval System. An example is the language of index expressions (see <ref> [BW92] </ref>). Index expressions are generated by the following syntax: Expr ! " j Nexpr NExpr ! Term Connector NExpr fl where Terms are generated from some given set of terms, and Connector from a set of connectors.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3.5 H (Pr " ) = d2D n 1 ) = log (n) Application of entropy theory yields (see <ref> [Gra90] </ref>): Lemma 3.6 H (Pr p ) H (Pr " ) for each search path p. The uncertainty is minimal if a single descriptor has probability Pr (d j p) = 1, and (thus) all other descriptors have probability 0.

Reference-contexts: We assume for each transition e a probability q e &gt; 0 of occurring. In a transition a) Refinements b) Derived transition net network, for each state a: X b:a!b 6 The transition matrix T is then defined as (see <ref> [GS92] </ref>): Definition 3.1 T (x; y) = q e if x and y are connected via edge e 0 otherwise 2 Since the state stop is the final state, T (stop; d) = 0 for each descriptor d. T (stop; stop) = 1 because this state cannot be left.

Reference-contexts: The design of an user interface is often undertaken as an afterthought although it should be an integrated part of the project plan and the budget. At present, analysis of human-computer interaction becomes more and more important. Features concerning the interaction between humans and computer are studied extensively (see <ref> [PK90] </ref>). In this paper we study how user behaviour can be integrated in a user interface. The behaviour of the user is monitored by examining the choices that were made by the user during the interaction with the machine.

Reference-contexts: A drawback of this approach is the introduction of noise in the retrieval result, as characterizations only provide partial semantics of documents. Another consequence is the introduction of omission. For a more elaborate discussion on these topics, see <ref> [Sal83] </ref>. For the purposes of this paper, we assume that the characterization language has a structure, which can be exploited to structure the search space, i.e. the set of descriptors associated with documents in the Information Retrieval System. An example is the language of index expressions (see [BW92]).

Reference-contexts: Pr (d j e) = i=0 T i (e; d) T (d; stop) If Q is the submatrix of T containing only the probabilities of transitions between descriptors, then 1 P T i (e; d) = i=0 Q i (e; d) which converges to (I Q) 1 (e; d) (see <ref> [Tri82] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: From this assumption we conclude that the entropy of the distribution function is a reasonable measure for the searcher's uncertainty <ref> [Wil92] </ref>. The entropy after having traversed path p is defined as the entropy of the resulting destination probability function, denoted as Pr p , defined as Pr p (d) = Pr (d j p).
