Which processors are shown is configurable, both before the run begins and also during the run. Profile is intended to be used with the Procedure Exit trace created by the Pablo Trace Library. (For more information see <ref> [11] </ref>.) Configuring Module Parameters (Phase One): contains radio buttons to specify whether the data should be presented in a display or as output records. Once Display or Output has been selected, it cannot be changed by reconfiguring the module. The default is Display.
