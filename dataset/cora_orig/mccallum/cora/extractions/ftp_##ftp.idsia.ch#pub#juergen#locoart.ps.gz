Reference-contexts: This central theme is basic to the pursuit of science, and goes back to the principle known as Occam's razor: "if presented with a choice between indifferent alternatives, then one ought to select the simplest one" <ref> [1] </ref>. Unconsciously or explicitly, informal application of this principle in science and mathematics abound. The principle of Occam's razor is not only relevant to science and mathematics, but to fine arts as well.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to formalize the intuitive notions of "simplicity" and "complexity." Appropriate mathematical tools are provided by the theory of Kolmogorov complexity (or algorithmic complexity) <ref> [2] </ref>. The Kolmogorov complexity of some computable object is essentially the length (measured in number of bits) of the shortest algorithm that can be used to compute it. The shorter the algorithm, the simpler the object [3].

Schmidhuber, </author> <title> "Discovering neural nets with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability", Neural Networks (1997, in press), for a machine learning application. </title> <note> A short version of this text has appeared in A. </note> <editor> Prieditis and S.

Reference-contexts: The Kolmogorov complexity of some computable object is essentially the length (measured in number of bits) of the shortest algorithm that can be used to compute it. The shorter the algorithm, the simpler the object <ref> [3] </ref>.
Reference: 4. <institution> See Kolmogorov [2]; Chaitin [2]; and Solomonoff [2]. </institution>
Reference-contexts: This objectivity is due to the compiler theorem. Noncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity. It can be shown that there is no single algorithm that can generate the shortest program for computing arbitrary given data on a given computer <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 Low-Complexity Art Suppose an artist's task is to produce a drawing that obeys a set of (possibly informal) predetermined specifications. The goal of low-complexity art is to represent the depicted object's essence by achieving two conflicting goals simultaneously: Goal 1. Given the specifications, the drawing should "look right".
Reference: 5. <institution> See Kolmogorov [2]; Chaitin [2]; and Solomonoff [2]. </institution>
Reference-contexts: Initial attempts to create a work of low-complexity art will usually have unpredictable results. 3 The noncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity implies that there is no general method for finding the shortest description of a piece of data <ref> [5] </ref>.
Reference: 6. <author> B. Mandelbrot, </author> <title> The Fractal Geometry of Nature (San Francisco: </title> <publisher> Freeman, </publisher> <year> 1982). </year>
Reference-contexts: The next section first defines a fractal <ref> [6] </ref> coding scheme for encoding drawings in algorithmic form. The coding scheme is easily learned and understood by most humans. Next, I present a set of cartoons, each of which satisfies some pre-determined formal specifications.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, many parts of the drawings are self-similar. 6 On Beauty and Minimum Description Length Sometimes an artist is appreciated for a distinctive style. Sometimes certain works of art are perceived as beautiful. This section attempts to relate the formalism of the theory of minimum description length (MDL) <ref> [8] </ref> to informal notions such as "beauty" and "good artistic style." This section, however, is not intended to address all aspects of beauty and interest, but only those related to "capturing the essence." 6.1 What is a Beautiful Drawing? What is beautiful? What is not? There clearly are no objective answers

Reference-contexts: If the current face looks like the prototype face, then there is very little additional information to compute. This would imply that the prototype face is perceived as the most beautiful one. Previous work on attractive faces. The statement above seems compatible with results presented by Langlois and Roggmann <ref> [9] </ref>, who claim that the "average face" (computed by digital blending of numerous photos of real faces) is perceived as the most attractive one. Perrett, May and Yoshikawa [10] partly dispute this claim, however.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on attractive faces. The statement above seems compatible with results presented by Langlois and Roggmann [9], who claim that the "average face" (computed by digital blending of numerous photos of real faces) is perceived as the most attractive one. Perrett, May and Yoshikawa <ref> [10] </ref> partly dispute this claim, however. Their test subjects also appreciate average faces computed by blending [11] but prefer "attractive average faces" constructed from faces perceived as attractive. Indeed, the most attractive faces are caricatures obtained by digitally exaggerating the deviations between "average" and "attractive average." Critique of previous work.

Reference-contexts: Why then in the arts? Shouldn't the arts, by exhibiting man's creative will, be filled with form, law and spirit?" <ref> [12] </ref> The ancient Greeks, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer, LeCorbusier and many others devised formal rules to draw things.

Reference-contexts: Certain representations of artistically interesting and aesthetically pleasing representations of fractal objects may be regarded as works of low-complexity art, such as pictures of hills, coastlines, etc. <ref> [13] </ref>. This is because they are based on relatively short and understandable algorithmic descriptions. Also, certain data-compression methods can be used to generate patterns that can be regarded as works of low-complexity art [14]. Similar statements could be made about certain other simplifying computer models for representing objects [15].

Apparently, however, nobody so far has identified low-complexity art and low-complexity design as such in its most general form.

Reference-contexts: This also provides a framework for the categorization of previous work. Finally, it should be mentioned that there have been attempts to use classic information theory <ref> [16] </ref> to formalize what is aesthetically pleasing [17]. Another contribution of this paper is to offer an alternative approach based on algorithmic information theory. 7.3 Outlook Possibilities for artistic expression depend on available technology.

The cave artists from the stone age did not have the technology for creating the colors that made impressionism possible.
