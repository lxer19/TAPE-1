Abstract: A practical and reusable process-independent controller must have the following capabilities: (1) generic interface to software, hardware, communication protocol, and process and equipment being controlled, (2) plug-and-play incorporation of third-party hardware and software modules, (3) capability to provide runto-run (R2R) control with or without lower level (in-situ) control, (4) dynamic operation with process drift and target shift, (5) dynamic updating of control scheme, and (6) utilization of many control and optimization methods in a complementary fashion. The GCC design is described by tracing a control/optimization cycle. At the beginning of the cycle a high-level process request is sent to the controller by a process engineer or factory controller. The GCC accesses its database and retrieves the equipment identification and process recipe. The GCCs recipe download module then communicates this recipe to the appropriate equipment controller. After the wafer to be processed is loaded into the equipment, the recipe download module sends a command to the equipment controller to start the process. When the process monitoring module determines that the process has been completed, it indicates the state of the process to the controller. The metrology module is then invoked; this module retrieves process and equipment data collected ex-situ. The process optimization and control module examines this data and attempts to determine a better equipment recipe to correspond to the high level process recipe; i.e., it uses a multi-branch optimization/control scheme (Figure 1) and modifies the existing equipment recipe so as to better achieve process target values. As the last step in the R2R cycle, the updated equipment recipe is stored in the controller database and linked to the appropriate high level process recipe by the process and optimization module. Results: Implementation Case Studies Experiments conducted for the first case study of plasma etching involved the etching of a simple 3-layer PolySilicon/SiO2/Si w afer (Figure 2). The experiment was tailored towards maintaining target parameters of average etch rate and over etch depth while controlling the input equipment parameters of etch time and oxygen flow. Other etch recipe parameters such as power, pressure, and various gas ows are kept constant. In the RIE experimental data (Figure 3), etch rate target changed after run #8, and oxygen flow sensor perturbed by 0.2 sccm after run #3.With open loop operation there is by definition no capability for compensation to target shifts or process perturbation. However with R2R control, the system effectively compensated for process shift and drift. Experiments conducted for R2R control of a CMP process involved the planarization of an unpatterned wafer (Figure 4). The planarizer experiment was designed to maintain target parameters of removal rate and uniformity while controlling the input equipment parameters of down pressure, back pressure, carrier velocity, and platen velocity. Other planarizer recipe parameters such as pad age are monitored but obviously not controllable. Experimental results (Figure 5) illustrate that the controller accurately compensated for a drop in removal rate while maintaining an acceptable level of uniformity. A process-independent controller, the Generic Cell Controller (GCC), has been designed and developed for the runto-run (R2R) control and optimization of semiconductor manufacturing processes. This GCC design utilizes sequential control and optimization branches in a complementary fashion. A GCC implementation has effectively controlled two different processes, RIE and CMP, without any change of code or design, thus illustrating process independence.
