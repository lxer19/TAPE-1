Title: How to Make a Square Grid Framework with Cables Rigid  
Author: Harold N. Gabow Tibor Jordan 
Abstract: This paper solves the problem of making a bipartite digraph strongly connected by adding the smallest number of new edges that preserve bipartiteness. A result of Baglivo and Graver shows this corresponds to making a 2-dimensional square grid framework with cables rigid by adding the smallest number of new cables. We prove a min-max formula for the smallest number of new edges in the digraph problem, and give a corresponding linear-time algorithm. We generalize these results to the problem of making an arbitrary digraph strongly connected by adding the smallest number of new edges, each of which joins vertices in distinct blocks of a given partition of the vertex set.

Reference-contexts: A potentially cheaper way to make a framework rigid is to use pliable material along the diagonals. A cable can be compressed but not stretched, and can join two diagonally-opposite points of a grid square (see Fig. 2). Baglivo and Graver <ref> [1] </ref> show that a framework with cables has a natural representation as a bipartite digraph, such that the framework is rigid if and only if its bipartite digraph is strongly connected (Fig. 2). <p> Our result corresponds to the k = 1 case of [3]. This case is the problem of augmenting a bipartite graph to make it connected and bipartite. This simple problem has no exceptional families. It is equivalent to the rod-framework rigidity problem, which was solved in <ref> [1] </ref> and [14]. Until now the cable-framework rigidity problem has been left open, perhaps because the phenomenon of exceptional families has been ignored. Section 2 of this paper gives basic facts about our augmentation problem, including the main lower and upper bounds on the solution size.
