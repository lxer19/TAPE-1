Abstract: This paper presents a simple and robust method of designing the lossy-transmission-line interconnects in a network for multichip modules. This method uses wire-sizing entirely to meet the electrical damping criteria to solve the problems encountered in propagating high-speed signals through unterminated lossy transmission lines on the substrates of multichip modules (MCM). The optimal design method is based on a new improved scattering-parameters (S-parameters) based macro-model of distributed-lumped networks that keeps track of the time-of-flight term in the transfer functions. The wire-sizing optimal design concept is to relate the layout parameter (line width) and the transfer function (damping ratio, and natural undamped frequency) to the signal propagation delay. The optimal design method results in fast and stable signal propagation for single-source multi-receiver networks on multichip modules without using termination resistors. Multi-receiver networks on High Performance MCM process technologies are designed for illustration.

Reference-contexts: Doing without the termination eliminates the heat generated by the terminator and solves the heat removal problem. Being unterminated, the long lines in the substrate are structured to exhibit a total resistance that is related to the source resistance of the active devices which drives the lines [6] <ref> [1] </ref>. Since voltage doubling occurs at the end of the unterminated line due to reflection, a controlled amount of attenuation is tolerable. For performance reason, slightly underdamped design gives shorter signal propagation delay with tolerable amount of overshoot [1] [7]. <p> the source resistance of the active devices which drives the lines [6] <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The transfer function H (s) also can be defined as <ref> [8] </ref>: H (s) = e st fi ^ H (s) (2.1) where t is the time-of-flight term, and ^ H (s) is the part of the transfer function representing the charging curve in the output waveform starting at a delay t after the input switches at t = 0. <p> So, the time-of-flight t , more precisely the factor e st , must be extracted from the transfer function of the circuit. The new and important improvement in the S-parameter based macro-model simulator is the extraction of the exact time-of-flight term in transfer functions <ref> [8] </ref>. By extracting the time-of-flight of scattering parameters for basic components, an effective network reduction is developed 7. Previous Work 17 to compute the lower order macro-model of an interconnect system, keeping track of time-of-flight delay. The output responses, due to the extraction of the time-of-flight, is greatly improved.

Reference-contexts: The damping ratio error minimization and delay minimization problem can be transformed into a least-squares estimation problem. After the transformation, the resulting least-squares estimation problem can be solved using an efficient optimization method <ref> [11] </ref> to obtain the optimal width assignment for the original problem.
