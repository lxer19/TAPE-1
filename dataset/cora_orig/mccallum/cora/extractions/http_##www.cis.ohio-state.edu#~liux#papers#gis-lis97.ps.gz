Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to extracting hydrographic objects such as rivers, lakes, and other water bodies from digital orthophoto images. A family of directional-sensitive operators is derived and applied to suppress the noise while preserving the desired features. The unique property of this operator family is that boundaries and junctions are preserved with high accuracy while noise within each object is greatly suppressed. A region-based grouping technique, which was derived from locally excitatory globally inhibitory network (LEGION) dynamics, is then applied to extract desired objects, the seeds of which are selected separately. To find hydrographic objects, seed points are automatically identified from the original image, based on the assumption that water bodies are homogenous. This approach is general and can be used to find other objects when appropriate seed selections are incorporated. Computationally, this approach is parallel and local in nature and can be efficiently implemented using a neural network. Experimental results using real images are provided.

Reference-contexts: Linear filters, including the most widely used Gaussian filter, replace each pixel value by a weighted average from its local neighborhood. The main drawback of linear filters is that image structures, mainly edges, will be degraded when noise is reduced <ref> (Canny, 1986) </ref>. To overcome this problem, nonlinear filters are proposed. <p> If we explicitly assume that the underlying structures in images are piecewise constant, which corresponds to the step edge model in designing many edge detectors, including the Canny edge detector <ref> (Canny, 1986) </ref>, estimating the presence of edges can be achieved through homogeneity testing. Tomita and Tsuji (1977) proposed a method which replaces each pixel by the average of the most homogeneous neighborhood among the five overlapped rectangular ones.

Reference-contexts: Because local pixel attributes are intrinsically ambiguous, i.e., pixels belonging to the same object can vary considerably while pixels belonging to different objects may have the same values, approaches based only on local attributes such as various thresholding methods <ref> (Castleman, 1996) </ref> have only limited success. In addition, noise introduced during image registration makes local attributes unreliable, and thus, worsens the problem. Therefore, first we need to recover local attributes that are corrupted by noise. <p> Some nonlinear filters, such as order-statistic neighbor operators, do not perform the estimation explicitly; their assumptions about the underlying structures reect that. For example, the median filter <ref> (Castleman, 1996) </ref> assumes that the median of the smoothing window is closest to the true value of the central pixel. To estimate the presence of edges, a good and popular choice is gradient. Therefore, many nonlinear filters are gradient-based.

Beyond theoretical properties, the network has been applied successfully for segmenting natural scene and medical images (Wang and Terman, 1997), texture images <ref> (Cesmeli and Wang, 1997) </ref>, and range images (Liu and Wang, 1997). While there are many parameters involved in the system, most of them are intrinsic. Only two parameters, namely W ik and W z need to be provided or determined by other methods.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Perona (Perona and Malik, 1987; Perona et al., 1994) posed the image smoothing problem as anisotropic diffusion. The basic idea is to prefer diffusion along the direction where the gradient is small. In general, many iterations may be needed and the final results tend to be piecewise constant <ref> (Perona et al., 1994) </ref>. If we explicitly assume that the underlying structures in images are piecewise constant, which corresponds to the step edge model in designing many edge detectors, including the Canny edge detector (Canny, 1986), estimating the presence of edges can be achieved through homogeneity testing.
