Title: cps2c 1.1: A Translator from Continuation Passing Style Representation to C  
Author: The Griffin Translator Group 
Date: January 15, 1996  
Abstract: This report describes a simple translator which translates a program in continuation passing style representation into a C program. This work is intended as a feasibility experiment for compiling Griffin programs into C programs with continuations. The result shows that this technique works good on a few simple griffin programs and we expect that compiling Griffin programs with continuations can be done by extending this translator to translating the Griffin intermediate representation into C.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Continuation-passing style (CPS) is a program notation that makes every aspect of control flow and data flow explicit. It also has the advantage that it is closly related to Church's -calculus, which is a well-defined and well-understood meaning <ref> [Appel 92] </ref>. A continuation is a function that expresses "what to do next". Thus, the returning from a function looks like a function call. With CPS transformation we can organize a compiler in a series of phases: 1.
