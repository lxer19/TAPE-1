Abstract: Mobile computing differs from desk-top computing because of the dynamic nature of system state: as users move, the sets of stationary and mobile objects they control and the types of information they wish to access change. Navigating a mobile environment can be aided by active maps that describe the location and characteristics of objects within some region as they change over time. We describe an active map service that keeps clients informed of changes in their environment. The primary issue driving our design is the question of scale: an active map service must be able to handle updates and queries over sufficiently large regions of space to satisfy clients' interests and must be able to handle peak loads that can occur when everyone in a region is moving around, for example, to attend a meeting. Our solution detects sets of clients that wish to receive the same active map information and then dynamically assigns multicast groups to them. To guarantee clients that they and their communication links will not be overloaded the active map provides guaranteed limits on bandwidth use.

Reference-contexts: In addition to assuming that packets can be routed to mobile hosts we also require efficient multicast communications. Although currently there is no standard combined mobile-multicast communications protocol, one can imagine extending the current mobile IP protocols to support multicast <ref> [1] </ref>. Throughout most of this paper we will assume that mobile-multicast is supported throughout the system. <p> Our work can take advantage of several lower-level communications technologies that have been, or are being, developed by others. These include IP-multicast [3], mobile IP [5], and mobile IP multicast <ref> [1] </ref>. A number of other systems also use a publish/subscribe style of information dissemination, most notably [9] and [8]. However, all these systems employ only broadcast or at most a few multicast groups for their implementation, resulting in extensive client-side filtering of messages.

Reference-contexts: Waiting for quiescence and batching the updates would reduce the message count to n, but would sacrifice timeliness. Using broadcast or multicast <ref> [3] </ref> for the updates would reduce the aggregate message traffic even further, but would likely increase the traffic seen by some clients, since not all clients are interested in exactly the same information. <p> Our work can take advantage of several lower-level communications technologies that have been, or are being, developed by others.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the availability of location-sensing facilities, we also assume that AMS clients can be reached by packet-based communications, such as IP. This requires that applications on mobile hosts are able to use a form of "mobile IP" communications protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, or employ a "mobile host-agent architecture" [10]. These approaches deliver messages to mobile hosts in different ways. <p> Our work can take advantage of several lower-level communications technologies that have been, or are being, developed by others.
