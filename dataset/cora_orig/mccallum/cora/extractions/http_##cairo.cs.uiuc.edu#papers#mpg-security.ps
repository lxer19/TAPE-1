Abstract: Continuous digital media such as video and audio are processed and communicated within networked infrastructures. The security of these media has become very important. If the encryption process is part of the video retrieval and playback process, then encryption and decryption must be performed in real time and the speed of the encryption/decryption algorithm matters. We show in this paper that the very different statistical behavior of compressed video media, in comparison to text, leads to a real-time, secure, and efficient encryption algorithm, which we call the Video Encryption Algorithm (VEA).

The most straight-forward method is to encrypt the entire MPEG stream using standard encryption methods. This is called the naive algorithm approach <ref> [AG96] </ref>. The greatest concern about this approach is the speed of processing due to the large size of MPEG files. Another method to secure MPEG streams is the selective encryption algorithm which encrypts only the I-frame of MPEG streams [MS95]. <p> However, Agi and Gong have shown that great portions of the video are visible partly because of interframe correlation and mainly from unencrypted I-blocks in the P and B frames. Therefore, only encrypting I frames may not work <ref> [AG96] </ref>. Meyer and Gadegast have designed a new MPEG-like bit-stream SECMPEG that incorporates selective encryption and additional header information, and has high-speed software execution [MG95]. SECMPEG can use both DES and RSA and implements four levels of security 1 . SECM-PEG is not compatible with standard MPEG.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Emerging distributed multimedia applications such as Video-on-Demand, video broadcast, multimedia mail and video conferencing must be provided with secure transmission. One approach is to simply apply known encryption algorithms such as DES <ref> [NIS93] </ref> or RSA [SA78]. However, if a user wants to use the encryption as part of the video retrieval and playback process in real-time, DES and RSA are not fast enough to satisfy this requirement.
