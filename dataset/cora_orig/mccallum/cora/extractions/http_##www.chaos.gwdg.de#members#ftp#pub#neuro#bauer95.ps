Title: Development of Oriented Ocular Dominance Bands as a Consequence of Areal Geometry

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that the different appearance of ocular dominance bands in the cat and the monkey is a consequence of the different mapping geometries in these species (LeVay et al. 1985, Anderson et al. 1988). Here I investigate the impact of areal geometries on the preferred direction of ocular dominance bands in two adaptive map formation models, the self-organizing feature map and the elastic net algorithm. In the case of the self organizing feature map, the occurrence of instabilities that correspond to ocular dominance bands can be analytically investigated. The instabilities automatically yield stripes of correct orientation. These analytic results are complemented by simulations. In the case of the elastic net algorithm, simulations reveal two different parameter regimes of the algorithm, only one of which leads to stripes of correct orientation. The results suggest that neighborhood preservation in visual maps is enforced in the backward direction, such that neighboring cells in the cortex have neighboring receptive fields, and not vice versa.

Reference-contexts: One example for such a qualitative feature is the different appearance of the ocular dominance systems in the striate cortex of the cat and the monkey. In the cat the OD stripes appear irregularly branched, and do not seem to have a preferred direction <ref> (Anderson et al. 1988) </ref>. In the monkey the OD bands appear as a series of parallel stripes, which run perpendicular to the representation of the horizontal meridian (LeVay et al. 1985). The pattern is reminiscient of a zebra (Swindale 1980).

Reference-contexts: If the input and output spaces of a map do not coincide in the number of dimensions and in the extensions along them, violations of neighborhood preservation can occur. Using a topographic 12 product, these violations can quantitatively be evaluated <ref> (Bauer and Pawelzik 1992) </ref>. Depending on whether a map formation algorithm enforces neighborhood preservation in the forward or the backward direction, the violations can have a different appearance, even when the mapping geometry is identical.

Reference-contexts: Identical elongation ratios in both spatial directions will be called isotropic geometric boundary conditions, differing elongation ratios will be called anisotropic boundary conditions. The self-organizing feature map has just one intrinsic length scale, the width oe of the cortical neighborhood function. In contrast, the elastic net algorithm <ref> (Durbin and Will-shaw 1987) </ref> has two length scales: the diameter of the receptive fields, k, and the width of a topology term, which is related to the cortical interaction. <p> Thus I can conclude this section by noting that the self organizing feature map exhibits geometry effects in the formation of OD bands which resemble closely the geometry effects hypothesized for the cat and the monkey. 3 Discretization dependence of OD stripes in the elastic net The elastic net algorithm <ref> (Durbin and Willshaw 1987) </ref> is a different map formation algorithm which has been applied in the context of orientation (Durbin and Mitchison 1990) and ocular dominance column formation (Goodhill and Willshaw 1990).

As in the self organizing feature map, the algorithm involves neuron elements in an output space A, located at the vertices r of a grid, which have receptive field centers at positions w r in the input space.

Here, I do not consider orientation dimensions and restrict myself to maps with just a single additional dimension, which corresponds to ocular dominance. An example for OD bands which emerge under isotropic boundary conditions is displayed in Fig. 1a.

Reference-contexts: Second, one can search for more examples of neighborhood violations in cortical maps. One such example, field discontinuities in the extrastriate areas of cat and monkey visual cortex (Tusa et al. 1979; Albus and Beckmann 1980; Allman et al. 1974), have recently been reproduced using the self-organizing feature map <ref> (Wolf et al. 1993, 1994) </ref>. This example is particularly striking, because here neighborhood violations occur in the forward direction only, not in the backward direction. 6 Acknowledgements Helpful discussions with Klaus Pawelzik, Fred Wolf and Ken Miller are gratefully acknowledged.
