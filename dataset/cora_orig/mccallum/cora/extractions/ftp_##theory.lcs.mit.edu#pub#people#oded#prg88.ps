Title: Reproduced from an old troff file (dating 1987/88). COMPUTATIONAL RANDOMNESS (a survey)  
Author: Oded Goldreich 
Abstract: A recent behaviouristic approach to randomness is surveyed. In this approach a probability distribution is considered "pseudorandom" if no "efficient procedure" can distinguish it from the uniform probability distribution. Remarkably, pseudorandomness so defined is expandable in the sense that (assuming the existence of 1-1 one-way functions) short pseudorandom sequences can be deterministically and efficiently expanded into much longer pseudorandom sequences. The new approach to randomness is based on basic concepts and results from the theory of resource-bounded computation. In order to make the survey as accessible as possible, we have presented elements of the theory of resource bounded computation (but only to the extent required for the description of the new approaches). This survey is not intended to provide an account of the more traditional approaches to randomness (e.g. Kolmogorov Complexity) and this approach is described only in order to confront it with the new approach. Note added in Dec. 1997: Section 4 of this survey may be read only for historical purposes. Otherwise, it is far inferior to results known nowadays, and consequently to existing presentations. For further details see Appendix.

Reference-contexts: We believe that the reader will not find the above Theorem 4 0 satisfactory, and urge him to prove our conjecture that the above two conditions are in fact equivalent to the mere existence of arbitrary one-way functions. Partial progress is reported in <ref> [GKL] </ref>. 7. CONCLUSIONS The fact that pseudorandom generators and functions exist under a reasonable complexity the-oretic assumption (i.e. the existence of one-way 1-1 and onto functions), must be considered at least a plausibility argument.
