Reference-contexts: The homogeneous equation (14) zh zz + (b z)h z ah = 0 is the well known Kummer's equation. In Abramowitz and Stegun <ref> [1] </ref>, we find that its independent solutions are H (0) (z) = M (a; b; z) (26) Note that M (a; b; z) is a standard notation for Kummer's function 15 : M (a; b; z) = i=0 (b) i i! where (a) i = a (a + 1)(a + 2) <p> Proof: Apply the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 6. 16 Other solutions grow exponentially as z ! 1. 17 See <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proof: We will prove (41). The upper equation is obvious from the defi nition of Y 0 . One can check that for k 1 F h (Y k1 (a; b; z)) = m=0 (b) m m! (k1) a + m m+1 : From <ref> [2] </ref> we know that that the function f (z) = (ff + 1)(ff + b) n=0 (ff + 2) n (ff + 1 + b) n solves the differential equation ^ L (f) = z ff .

Reference-contexts: No exact analytic solution is known for the PDE's for options on stocks with constant continuous dividend pay-out and for Asian options based on the arithmetic mean. The papers related to the subject of options on dividend paying stocks consider discrete dividends <ref> [3] </ref>, [9], [13], [14] or continuous proportional dividends [4]. Merton [12] considered the valuation of options on stocks with constant continuous dividend pay-out. He gave a sufficient condition for no early exercise of American options and also valued perpetual options. However, he was unable to value or approximate finite-lived options.

Reference-contexts: To value options that do not have an exact analytic solution, one can try the method of lines that was first introduced to the finance literature by P. 2 We use [15] as a reference book for PDE's in financial applications. 2 Carr and D. Faguet <ref> [5] </ref>. The main idea of this method is to approximate a partial derivative with respect to time in the corresponding PDE by a finite difference and then to solve the resulting sequence of non-homogeneous ODE's. <p> The approximation error of this method is determined by the length of time increments used for finite differences. Richardson extrapolation can be applied to accelerate convergence of the approximation errors to zero. In <ref> [5] </ref>, P. Carr and D. Faguet obtained a closed form solution to the sequence of ODE's approximating American options on stocks that do not pay dividends. They also have a semi-analytic approximation for American options on stocks paying continuous proportional dividends.

Reference-contexts: He gave a sufficient condition for no early exercise of American options and also valued perpetual options. However, he was unable to value or approximate finite-lived options.

In some papers analytic approximations are developed for finite-lived Asian options based on the arithmetic mean but these results do not provide any indication of their precision.

The last two equations imply that C (t; S) satisfies the PDE obtained by Merton in <ref> [12] </ref> 1 S 2 2 C ss + (rS d) C s rC = C t : (8) Note that the same PDE works for American style calls 7 and for put options 8 as long as the underlying stock follows model (3).
