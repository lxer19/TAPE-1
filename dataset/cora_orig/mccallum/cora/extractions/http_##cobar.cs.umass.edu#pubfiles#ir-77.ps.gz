Abstract: Automatic query expansion has long been suggested as a technique for dealing with the fundamental issue of word mismatch in information retrieval. A number of approaches to expansion have been studied and, more recently, attention has focused on techniques that analyze the corpus to discover word relationships (global techniques) and those that analyze documents retrieved by the initial query ( local feedback). In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of these approaches and show that, although global analysis has some advantages, local analysis is generally more effective. We also show that using global analysis techniques, such as word context and phrase structure, on the local set of documents produces results that are both more effective and more predictable than simple local feedback.

Reference-contexts: Local analysis, on the other hand, involves only the top ranked documents retrieved by the original query. We have called it local because the techniques are variations of the original work on local feedback <ref> [Attar & Fraenkel, 1977, Croft & Harper, 1979] </ref>. This work treated local feedback as a special case of relevance feedback where the top ranked documents were assumed to be relevant. Queries were both reweighted and expanded based on this information. <p> of disk space and computer time to do the global context analysis and build the searchable database, and individual queries can be significantly degraded by expansion. 3 Local Analysis 3.1 Local Feedback The general concept of local feedback dates back at least to a 1977 paper by Attar and Fraenkel <ref> [Attar & Fraenkel, 1977] </ref>. In this paper, the top ranked documents for a query were proposed as a source of information for building an automatic thesaurus. Terms in these documents were clustered and treated as quasi-synonyms.

Reference-contexts: In recent TREC conferences, however, simple local feedback techniques appear to have performed quite well. In this paper, we expand using a procedure similar to that used by the Cornell group in TREC 4 & 3 <ref> [Buckley et al., 1996] </ref>. The most frequent 50 terms and 10 phrases (pairs of adjacent non stop words) from the top ranked documents are added to the query.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach used by [Qiu & Frei, 1993], and the analysis produced is related to the representations generated by other dimensionality-reduction techniques <ref> [Deerwester et al., 1990, Caid et al., 1993] </ref>. The essential difference is that global analysis is only used for query expansion and does not replace the original word-based document representations. Reducing dimensions in the document representation leads to problems with precision.

Other researchers have developed similar approaches [Qiu & Frei, 1993, Schutze & Pedersen, 1994] and have also reported good results.

Reference-contexts: Below are the steps to use local context analysis to expand a query Q on a collection. 1. Use a standard IR system (INQUERY) to retrieve the top n ranked passages. A passage is a text window of fixed size (300 words in these experiments <ref> [Callan, 1994] </ref>). There are two reasons that we use passages rather than documents. Since documents can be very long and about multiple topics, a co-occurrence of a concept at the beginning and a term at the end of a long document may mean nothing.

Reference-contexts: In many applications, however, the queries are very short. For example, applications that provide searching across the World-Wide Web typically record average query lengths of two words <ref> [Croft et al., 1995] </ref>. Although this may be one extreme in terms of IR applications, it does indicate that most IR queries are not long and that techniques for dealing with word mismatch are needed. An obvious approach to solving this problem is query expansion.

Reference-contexts: Instead, it has been proposed that by automatically analyzing the text of the corpus being searched, a more effective thesaurus or query expansion technique could be produced. One of the earliest studies of this type was carried out by Sparck Jones <ref> [Sparck Jones, 1971] </ref> who clustered words based on co-occurrence in documents and used those clusters to expand the queries. A number of similar studies followed but it was not until recently that consistently positive results have been obtained.

Reference-contexts: This is the basic idea behind the use of a thesaurus in query formulation. There is, however, little evidence that a general thesaurus is of any use in improving the effectiveness of the search, even if words are selected by the searchers <ref> [Voorhees, 1994] </ref>. Instead, it has been proposed that by automatically analyzing the text of the corpus being searched, a more effective thesaurus or query expansion technique could be produced.
