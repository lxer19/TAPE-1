Abstract: We have developed statistical techniques to study the structure the state-transition graphs of cellular automata with periodic boundary conditions, in the limit of large system size. We organize our results around the concept of a topological skeleton. The topological skeleton is the set of physically relevant states. Covering this skeleton is a surface, typically thin and dense, which contains the bulk of the set of states. States in the skeleton have some long histories. States on the surface, by contrast, have only short histories; they are reached only near the beginning of cellular automaton evolution. We study in detail a sequence of rules which exhibit mostly skeletal to mostly surface structure.

Reference-contexts: A likely preimage for a sub-block may be incompatible with any preimage of a sub-block further on. The natural measure provides definite, but generally limited, knowledge about possible configuration histories. In some sense (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) the more complex the rule, the more the present state of the system encodes the entire history of its production. Our statistical inverse iteration procedure is one general way to exploit this record, albeit imperfectly. Chaotic, relatively uncomplex, rules forget their history.

Reference-contexts: Like class I and II rules, random initial configurations tend under rule 54 toward simple temporally periodic states. Unlike rules in 5 classes I and II, however, random initial configurations exhibit long chaotic transients before reaching a periodic state <ref> [3] </ref>. For small times the behavior of rule 54 resembles that of a robustly class III rule. Rule 54 is a marginal or critical rule in many respects. While it appears to possess a natural measure, this measure is approached very slowly from typical initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: For these rules the state space (the set of configurations on the lattice) is organized as a collection of cycles, with a forest of transient trees rooted on each cycle. The leaves of the trees are configurations which have no preimages, the so-called Gardens of Eden <ref> [4] </ref>. In the opposite extreme, configurations on cycles have preimages infinitely far back in time. Configurations on the branches of the trees have an intermediate maximum-length history. In this paper we characterize cellular automata by the shape of their transient trees.

Reference-contexts: When dynamical notions developed for low-dimensional dynamical systems are applied without care to spatially extended dynamical systems, certain paradoxes may arise. Such was signaled by Crutchfield and Kaneko in their 30 study of transient and invariant behavior of coupled-map lattices <ref> [5] </ref>. Their results show that to overly restrict focus on invariant properties is to fail to comprehend the physical character of these systems. Acknowledgments We would like to thank P. Grassberger, C.

Reference-contexts: Connections with smooth dynamical systems. We suggest that the topological skeleton could play a similar role in the analysis of the dynamics of cellular automata to that played by the skeleton of unstable periodic orbits in the cycle-expansion approach of Cvitanovic <ref> [6] </ref> for the analysis of smooth dynamical systems. The direct cycle-expansion approach to cellular automata is blocked by several technical challenges, including: 1) While for low-dimensional, smooth dynamical systems, statistical properties are well-approximated using a few, short, cycles, for cellular automata, there may be an infinite number of short cycles.

Reference-contexts: However, some analytical results concerning the set of temporal cycles have been obtained in a sequence of papers by Jen [23, 24, 25] for some large classes of rules, and for various rules with special characteristics e.g. [29]. In addition, McIntosh <ref> [30] </ref> has collected a variety of mathematical techniques, which serve, for example, to count one-time-step preimages of small configurations. Published numerical work on state-transition graphs mostly concentrates on lattices small enough that complete enumeration of all possible trees and cycles is possible.

Reference-contexts: Typically, such enumeration is limited by practical considerations to lattices of size 20 or less. For example, the appendices to [34] contain catalogs of state-transition diagrams, counts on the number of cycles etc., for nearest-neighbor automata. These catalogs have been extended in [38].

By convention, these rules are referred to by their rule numbers <ref> [34] </ref>. In the six rules chosen for study, 30, 22, 18, 54, 110, and 4, we have a roughly graded sequence from a rule whose state-transition graph is almost purely skeleton (rule 30) to a rule whose state-transition graph is almost purely surface (rule 4).

Reference-contexts: This measure is stable in that apart from a measure-zero set in the set of measures, all initial measure tend to the standard measure under the action of the rule [28]. Numerical evidence <ref> [35] </ref> suggests that the random character at the level of the measure on the 4 invariant set has a direct correspondence in the randomness at the level of configurations. That is, rule 30 generates configurations with a high degree of temporal and spatial randomness.

Reference-contexts: However, while the natural measure of rule 30 is trivial, that of rule 22 is highly complex. Though correlations show an overall exponential decay, there are intricate fine-scale deviations, indicating subtle long-range effects [9, 16]. Rule 22 is a representative chaotic or Wolfram class III rule <ref> [36] </ref>. As the radius or number of states of cellular automata increase the fraction of rules which are chaotic approaches 1. Hence the behavior of rule 22 should be representative of a large class of rules. Rule 18. <p> It supports a variety of gliders which propagate on a periodic background. These gliders have been cataloged in <ref> [36] </ref> and [17]. Li and Nordahl [27] have shown in a Monte-Carlo study that the transient times for rule 110 increase as a power law, a result which we confirm here. The ordering of rule 110 with respect to rule 54 is somewhat arbitrary.

For example, the appendices to [34] contain catalogs of state-transition diagrams, counts on the number of cycles etc., for nearest-neighbor automata.

Such extrap 2 olation is difficult, since the structure of state-transition diagrams tends to depend sensitively on system size, especially when the system size is small. <p> To explore this issue, we must have a method to measure the length of the possible histories of a configuration. To this end, we have developed a technique for statistical inverse iteration of irreversible cellular automata. This technique is an extension of that proposed by Wuensche <ref> [38] </ref>, modified for efficiency, and to take account of the physical properties of cellular automata. 3 Organization of the paper. After a general introduction (section 1) we summarize previously published information concerning the rules under study (section 2). <p> Once a preimage for b i+1 has been selected, the process may be iterated with the pair b i+1 b i+2 , and so on (When n = 1 and all possible paths are followed recursively, this procedure reduces to that of <ref> [38] </ref>). Since we are constructing preimages for periodic configurations, the preim-age chosen for b m must match the preimage chosen for b 0 . There are many ways to attempt to satisfy this constraint.

Reference-contexts: It remains to be seen to what extent the surface/skeleton structure we have identified is general, and to what extent it depends on the uniformity and locality of cellular automata. It would be fairly immediate to extend this analysis to random boolean nets. Wuensche <ref> [39] </ref> has developed an inverse iteration algorithm for boolean nets which could be used to ex 29 plore surface and skeleton structure in this systems along the lines developed here.

Reference-contexts: Additional work along these lines is reported in [34, 12, 14, 26, 27]. Topological Skeleton. The topological skeleton concept is meant to reconcile two sets of results which may seem in contradiction. On one hand, it has been shown <ref> [41] </ref> that for most rules the probability that a randomly selected configuration is a Garden of Eden configuration ( i.e. has no preim-ages) rapidly approaches 1 as the size of the configuration increases. This suggests that state-transition graphs typically contain highly branched transient trees of low depth. <p> The Gardens of Eden form the leaves of the state-transition graph, at the extreme surface. As mentioned above, Wuensche <ref> [41] </ref> has obtained evidence that in the limit of large system size almost all configurations are Gardens of Eden, for typical rules. Here we confirm this result, using a sampling technique slightly different from his.
