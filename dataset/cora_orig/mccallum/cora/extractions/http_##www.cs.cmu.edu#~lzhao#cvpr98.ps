Abstract: In this paper, we present a car tracking system which provides quantitative and qualitative motion estimates of the tracked car simultaneously from a moving observer. First, we construct three motion models (constant velocity, constant acceleration, and turning) to describe the qualitative motion of a moving car. Then the models are incorporated into the Extended Kalman Filters to perform quantitative tracking. Finally, we develop an Extended Interacting Multiple Model (EIMM) algorithm to manage the switching between models and to output both qualitative and quantitative motion estimates of the tracked car. Accurate motion modeling and efficient model management result in a high performance tracking system. The experimental results on simulated and real data demonstrate that our tracking system is reliable and robust, and runs in real-time. The multiple motion representations make the system useful in various autonomous driving tasks.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a real-time vehicle tracking system which provides quantitative and qualitative motion estimates simultaneously from a moving platform and using a laser rangefinder. The system was developed in the context of the Automated Highway System (AHS) project <ref> [1] </ref> and is intended to provide accurate motion estimation, motion classification, and reliable maneuver detection. To our knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative motion estimates into a single algo rithm.

Reference-contexts: First, we classify the vehicle motion into three qualitative kinematic modes: constant velocity mode, constant acceleration mode, and turning mode. Then, we derive the motion model of each mode and incorporate each model into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) <ref> [10] </ref> to track vehicles separately. The advantage of employing multiple motion models for tracking is that we can detect and predict the car maneuver as a separate event, and we can obtain more accurate motion interpretation in both quantitative and qualitative senses. <p> The IMM algorithm is a superior and an attractive technique for managing multiple models and for tracking maneuvering targets. It provides good state estimates and it is real time. Good state estimates result in good model probability estimates and vice versa. Since its model probability computation <ref> [10] </ref> is based on the model likelihoods and the model switching matrix governed by the Markov chain, which provides a good statistical criterion for motion classification or qualitative motion interpretation, it is therefore straightforward to extend the IMM algorithm to provide qualitative motion analysis.

Reference-contexts: In the following frames, the car is tracked by searching within a small area around the position predicted by the motion estimator (Figure 2 (d): dotted box). This can be considered as soft gaze control, which is much simpler and faster than hard gaze control <ref> [14] </ref>. If there are two cars present in the area, the one nearest to the predicted position is chosen.

Reference-contexts: Both quantitative and qualitative representations as discussed by Thompson and Kearney <ref> [15] </ref> have advantages and disadvantages. Qualitative representation captures the significant characteristics of motion, but it has a low degree of precision. <p> motion classes 1 0 0 constant positive speed -1 0 0 constant negative speed 0 1 0 constant acceleration 0 -1 0 constant deceleration 0 0 1 turning to the left hand side 0 0 -1 turning to the right hand side Following Thompson and Kearney's definition of qualitative representation <ref> [15] </ref>, we define the qualitative motion representation as a set of labels of the kinematic behaviors of vehicles, including constant velocity mode (CV), constant acceleration mode (CA) and turning mode (T).

Reference-contexts: The reason that we choose to represent the direction of travel () instead of the direction of heading ( h ) is that they are not equivalent when the car is moving at high speed. In fact = h + ffi, where ffi is the slip angle <ref> [16] </ref>. Since the direction of travel is more relevant to our autonomous driving task, accordingly we choose to represent the turning rate of the travel direction instead of that of heading.
