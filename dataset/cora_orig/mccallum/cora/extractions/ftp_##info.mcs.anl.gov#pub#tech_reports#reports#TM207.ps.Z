Reference-contexts: For example, -basedir "http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi" causes &lt;base href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi"&gt; to be written to the file. 3 doctext One of the most difficult tasks in creating extensive hypertext is generating the initial documents and providing an easy way to link to them. The doctext <ref> [1] </ref> program can be used to generate versions of Unix-style man pages from the C source code of routines. This program can generate nroff (for using man and xman), LaTeX (for generating printed manuals), and HTML. <p> This program can generate nroff (for using man and xman), LaTeX (for generating printed manuals), and HTML. For the HTML to be useful, there must be an easy way to create links to the generate documents. This section describes how to do that; doctext itself is documented in <ref> [1] </ref>. To generate HTML man pages of a collection of source files in `/home/me/foo', do the following: cd mkdir www mkdir www/man3 cd foo doctext -html -index ../foo.cit " -indexdir http://www.mcs.anl.gov/me/foo/www/man3 " -mpath ../www/man3 *.[ch] cd ..
