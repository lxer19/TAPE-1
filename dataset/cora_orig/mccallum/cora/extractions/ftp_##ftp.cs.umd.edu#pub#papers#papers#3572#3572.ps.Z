Abstract: In this paper, we propose a traffic model for the characterization of VBR MPEG-coded video streams. This model provides the means to generate synthetic MPEG streams that can be used in performance studies of ATM networks. The model is appropriately fitted to three long empirical video sequences taken from different movies. We use multiple components to model bit rate variations in an MPEG stream. These components have different time scales. Long-term variations in the bit rate are captured at the scene level. Within a scene, the sizes of I frames tend to slightly fluctuate around some average. Hence, we measure the activity of the scene by the average size of I frames in that scene. This average varies from one scene to another, and its randomness is reasonably approximated by a lognormal distribution. For a given scene, the fluctuations of the sizes of I frames about their mean are modeled as an AR(2) time series. Finally, we show that the sizes of P and B frames can be appropriately fitted by lognormal distributions, with corresponding parameters. Using the compression pattern, the complete frame size sequence is formed by intermixing three subsequences, each of which describes the frame size sequence for a particular frame type. The validity of the model is demonstrated by the similarity between a synthetic stream and an actual trace, in terms of the correlation structure, the marginal distribution, the sample paths, and more importantly, the queueing performance. keywords: compressed video, MPEG, variable bit rate, traffic models.

Reference-contexts: A more recent draft, known as MPEG-2 [7], is optimized for an average bit rate of 5 Mbits/s. MPEG-2 was accepted as the basis for the HDTV standard in the United States <ref> [1] </ref>. The standardization and widespread acceptance of MPEG are the main reasons for choosing it among other compression techniques to be the focus of our research. Additionally, the MPEG algorithm involves several modes of compression, some of which are the basis of other compression algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In fitting a time series by an autoregressive model, the PACF of the time series provides a means to determine the number of autoregressive coefficients (i.e., the order of the autoregressive model) that are adequate for the fitting (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The sample PACF for the sequence f b I (n)g in Oz and Lambs traces exhibits large first and second autoregressive coefficients, suggesting an AR (2) fit. In Bond trace, an AR (1) seems sufficient. <p> A normal distribution for f I (n)g is naturally obtained if the residuals are also normally distributed. Hence, we let f " = N (0; 2 " ). Estimates of the parameters a 1 and a 2 in (10) can be obtained using Yule-Walker equations <ref> [2] </ref>: 2 a 1 3 2 1 r 1 3 1 2 r 1 3 where r k is the empirical autocorrelation for f e I (n)g at lag k. These estimates are given in Table 4 for the three traces. <p> These estimates are given in Table 4 for the three traces. Using these estimates, we fitted the sequence f e I (n)g in each trace to an AR (2) model and computed the experimental residuals (see <ref> [2] </ref>, Chapter 7). The ACF for these residuals in the Oz trace is shown in Figure 12. The absence of correlations among the residuals is a strong evidence of the appropriateness of our model (similar behavior was also observed in Lambs and Bond traces). <p> An estimate of 2 " is given by the the sum-of-squares of the experimental residuals divided by the number of samples (I frames). These estimates are provided in Table 4. The variance of I (n) is given by <ref> [2] </ref>: 2 (1 a 2 ) 2 (1 + a 2 ) (1 a 2 ) 2 a 2 fl (12) 13 f b I (n)g in Oz trace. the AR (2) fit (Oz trace). Let m be the autocorrelation in f I (n)g at lag m (m &gt; 0). <p> Let m be the autocorrelation in f I (n)g at lag m (m &gt; 0). Then (see <ref> [2] </ref>), m = (A B)(1 + AB) where A and B are the roots of the characteristic equation x 2 a 1 x a 2 = 0.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a traffic model for an MPEG stream is applicable, as well, to video streams that are compressed using the JPEG algorithm. Several studies investigated the characterization of compressed video traffic (see <ref> [3] </ref> for a survey). Only few of these studies dealt with characterization of MPEG traffic [13, 5, 8]. We believe that video models based on compression algorithms other than MPEG do not accurately characterize the variability of an MPEG stream.

Reference-contexts: Rose's movies were taken from VCR tapes, and were digitized at a rate of 25 frames/sec using a SunVideo card (Bond movie was recorded from cable TV, while Lambs movie was recorded from a commercial cassette [14]).

Such an encoder is ideal for our purposes since it does not limit the output peak rate (as is the case with hardware encoders).

Reference-contexts: Despite the simplicity of that model, it significantly overestimates the traffic behavior. The MPEG compression algorithm relies on two basic techniques: block-based motion compen 1 sation for the reduction of the temporal redundancy and DCT-based compression for the reduction of the spatial redundancy <ref> [12] </ref>. Motion compensation techniques are applied with both causal (i.e., predictive) and noncausal (i.e., interpolative) coding. Three types of compressed frames are generated by an MPEG encoder: Intra-coded (I ), Predictive (P ), and Bidirectional (B ) frames.
