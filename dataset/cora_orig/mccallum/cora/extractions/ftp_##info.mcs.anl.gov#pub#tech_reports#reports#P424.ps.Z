The Mesoscale Model and MPP The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model simulates meso-alpha scale (200-2000 km) and meso-beta scale (20-200 km) atmospheric circulation systems <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. MM has been developed over a period of twenty years, first at the Penn-sylvania State University and more recently also at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It is used for real-time forecasting and atmospheric research, including climate prediction and storms research.

Reference-contexts: Program Composition Notation (PCN) is a language and run-time system developed at Argonne and at the California Institute of Technology for expressing parallel programs <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. It provides an intermediate layer between the application program and the physical processors of a computer. It allows the model to be statically decomposed over a virtual machine, but this virtual machine can be mapped and remapped dynamically over the physical computer.
