Abstract: Association rules are statements of the form "for 90 % of the rows of the relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set X, then it has 1 also in the columns in set Y ". Efficient methods exist for discovering association rules from large collections of data. The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large that the rules cannot be presented to the user. We show how the set of rules can be pruned by forming rule covers. A rule cover is a subset of the original set of rules such that for each row in the relation there is an applicable rule in the cover if and only if there is an applicable rule in the original set. We also discuss grouping of association rules by clustering, and present some experimental results of both pruning and grouping.

Reference-contexts: It can be useful to loosen this restriction by allowing that some small portion " of the rows is not matched by the rule cover . The next lemmas follow immediately from the properties of the greedy heuristics for set cover problems (see, e.g., <ref> [CLR90] </ref>). Lemma 1 Algorithm RuleCover works correctly. Lemma 2 Denote by opt the size of the smallest cover for the matched database rows m (X i Y ).

Reference-contexts: One way of specifying such information is to provide structural information about the rule expressions that are interesting. With templates, for instance, the user can explicitly specify both what is interesting and what is not <ref> [KMR + 94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Rules can be ordered based on their interestingness. Obvious measures of interestingness are the confidence and support factors of rules. More complex measures can also be computed to reflect the statistical significance or financial value of rules <ref> [PSM94] </ref>. Some interestingness measures can be derived from user-specified template information. Such measures are useful for spotting the most interesting rules, but they do not help much in presenting a large collection of rules. A useful method for structuring a set of rules is clustering.

Reference-contexts: Example 3 The latter of the following rules is more special than the first one, and has no additional predictive power over it: 1 The usage of the term cover is borrowed from database theory, where it is extensively used (see <ref> [Ull88] </ref>); there is also a close similarity to the set cover problem. Similar notions have also been used in the machine learning literature [MMHL86, CN89].
