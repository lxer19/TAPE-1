Title: The Isomorphism Conjecture Holds Relative to an Oracle  
Author: Stephen Fenner Lance Fortnow Stuart A. Kurtz 
Date: December 18, 1992  
Abstract: We introduce symmetric perfect generic sets. These sets vary from the usual generic sets by allowing limited infinite encoding into the oracle. We then show that the Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture [BH77] holds relative to any sp-generic oracle, i.e., for any symmetric perfect generic set A, all NP A -complete sets are polynomial-time isomorphic relative to A. Prior to this work there were no known oracles relative to which the isomorphism conjecture held. As part of our proof that the isomorphism conjecture holds relative to symmetric perfect generic sets we also show that P A = FewP A for any symmetric perfect generic A.

Whether f A (') is good will, of course, depend on A. Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH77] </ref> show that in order to have SAT A isomorphic to f A (SAT A ) we need only find a polynomial-time 1-1 length-increasing invertible function g A that reduces SAT A to f A (SAT A ). <p> Note that the only possible q such that k^g A (1) (q)k &gt; 1 is q = g A () because of 3 (a). Let G A (') = ^g A (p ('; q)) where p is the padding function for SAT A . Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH77] </ref> show that Lemma 5.2 below immediately implies that SAT A is p A -isomorphic to L. Lemma 5.2 The function G A is a 1-1 length increasing reduction from SAT A to L whose inverse is computable in FP A . Proof: Clearly G A is a reduction.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4.1 If A is an sp-generic oracle then P A = FewP A . 4 This proof will build on ideas from Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref> and Hartmanis and Hemachan- dra [HH91].

Consider the following algorithm for computing M A (x) using A as an oracle. The idea is the same as that used in <ref> [BI87] </ref>. We repeatedly look for some extension ff of the partial oracle (not necessarily consistent with A) which makes M have the maximum possible number of accepting paths. To ensure consistency with A, we then answer all queries in the domain of ff according to A. <p> If n = 0, then ff = ;. fl/ 5 fl j+1 (A restricted to dom (ff)). /fl This trick is borrowed from <ref> [BI87] </ref>.

Theorem 4.1 now follows from the following two lemmas. <p> Thus we accept if and only if M A (x) has at least one accepting path. It remains only to prove Lemma 4.5. This is similar to the incompatibility argument in <ref> [BI87] </ref>. It suffices to show that dom (fi) dom (fl), since both fi and fl are compatible with A. Suppose that for some j &lt; jxj 2i we have kdom (fi) dom (fl j )k = ` &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Using the fact that P A = FewP A for sp-generic A and applying this construction twice we can produce a 1-1 length-increasing reduction g. Grollmann and Selman <ref> [GS88] </ref> show that we get g invertible for free since P A = UP A for sp-generic A. 5.2 Proof of the Relativized Isomorphism Conjecture In order to formally prove Theorem 1.1, we need the following technical lemma proven in Section 5.3. <p> By Corollary 4.2, we know that P A = UP A .
