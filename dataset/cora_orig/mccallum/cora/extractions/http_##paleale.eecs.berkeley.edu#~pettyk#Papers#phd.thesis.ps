Reference-contexts: The benefit-to-cost ratio that they computed was 2:1. But given the dubious method for calculating benefits this should not be trusted. 6.4.2 Cambridge Systematics, Inc. The Cambridge Systematics report in 1990 <ref> [1] </ref> was a review of the various incident management programs in five major metropolitan areas in the United States. The report 132 has become a popular citation because of its estimates of average delay per incident type. <p> All of the other studies just used previously published values with little regard for the fact that they might not be 137 Study Year Location B-C # Trucks Miles Time Fambro [33] 1976 Houston 2 3 64 24 hr/day Cambridge <ref> [1] </ref> 1990 Chicago 17 35 80 24 hr/day Siegfried [75] 1991 Houston 7 6 ? 6am - 10pm Hawkins [43] 1993 Houston 19 2 ~ 10 ?

For 180 example, other studies <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that demand during an incident may decrease due to highway advisory messages that inform drivers about the incident on the freeway. Thus causing some of them to take an alternate route.

Reference-contexts: Since the introduction of the back propagation training algorithm, multilayer feedforward networks have become the most popular [84]. As neural networks have become popular, researchers have quickly applied the techniques to the field of incident detection <ref> [2, 45, 70, 84] </ref>. Neural network detection algorithms usually take as input the flow and occupancy measurements from a pair of loop detectors over a certain number of time steps. <p> For example, Stephanedes and Chassiakos [83] used video cameras to develop a data set that had 0.32 incidents/mile/hour|a factor of 20 less than the rate on I-880. It is hard to believe that they used all of the incidents available. In another example, Abdulhai and Ritchie <ref> [2] </ref> distilled the I-880 data from 1210 incidents down to 45. <p> It is important to note that we did not pre-screen the incidents that we included in the study. We took everything that was in the incident database. This differs quite a bit from many incident detection studies <ref> [2] </ref>. Many studies try to find major incidents on the freeway by hand and then try to detect only those incidents. We believe that one should be using an incident detection algorithm to determine what type of incidents are detectable. Any pre-screening of incidents is going to bias the results.

Reference-contexts: We draw some obvious parallels to the field of evaluating FSP systems. 72 4.1 Sensor Fusion Multi-sensor data fusion involves collecting, processing and combining of data from different, possibly heterogeneous, sensors and historical databases to achieve a better understanding of the phenomenon under study <ref> [6] </ref>. Individual sensors provide only limited coverage, resolution and accuracy. Hence the analysis of individual sensor reports tend to lead to highly local interpretations of variables. But when fused together in an intelligent manner, multi-sensor systems wield considerably more power than the sum of its components. <p> One theme in sensor fusion is the push to always incorporate a fusion process that is context sensitive <ref> [6] </ref>. This context is used in determining effective constraints for sensor output. Hence, also present at the data level are methods that try to cluster or gate observations to weed out spurious measurements. Feature-level data is collected by extracting some representative feature from sensor data.

Reference-contexts: It suffices to say that in order to have a low call blocking probability, some that the cellular phone companies like, one needs to set aside 2 to 3 channels per base station [21]. The capacity of a single CDPD channel is approximately 19.2 Kbps <ref> [7] </ref>. Hence, a single base station, indeed, a single CDPD channel, could more than accommodate the information needed to run this probe-based incident detection algorithm. 3.6 Conclusions We conclude that it possible to detect certain types of incidents with a probe-based incident detection algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Incident detection with tripwire systems are also being explored. For example, researchers have attempted to do incident detection with the AUTOSCOPE system [56]. Actually, there is a commercial product that does incident detection based on the AUTO-SCOPE system <ref> [8] </ref>. Since the AUTOSCOPE is essentially a video-based loop detector the algorithms to determine if an incident has occurred are not significantly different from the ones used for loop detectors. The major drawback is that video image processing systems, in general, are sensitive to changing environmental conditions.

Reference-contexts: It's not that the algorithms aren't implemented in the field, because in a few places they are. It's just that their performance has been so disappointing that practitioners have decided to all but ignore the algorithms. Balke <ref> [9] </ref> did an excellent job surveying the state-of-the-art in implementing incident detection algorithms in the field. The conclusions were less than stellar. Of the seven TMC sites that he surveyed, 4 of them had an automatic incident detection algorithm in operation. We summarize his results on implementation in Table 2.3. <p> Los Angeles, California Modified California Alg. yes Minneapolis, Minnesota Modified California Alg. Northern Virginia Modified California Alg. yes Seattle, Washington Modified California Alg. Toronto, Ontario McMasters yes Table 2.3: Automatic incident detection algorithms in practice. Taken from the 1993 report by Balke <ref> [9] </ref>. humans watching video cameras, as shown in this quote from Balke: "However, during the on-site observations, the operators appeared to pay little attention to the incident detection algorithm. <p> The task of incident detection was presented in the Neyman-Pearson framework as well as the Bayesian decision theory framework, and a number of common incident detection schemes were reviewed. We concluded our overview of incident detection by reviewing the work by Balke <ref> [9] </ref> on the current state of incident detection in practice. The results were less than encouraging with only four sites around the country running an incident detection algorithm in the field (although from his report it wasn't clear if anybody actually relied on the algorithms).

Reference-contexts: We only get measurements when a tagged vehicle passes a roadside beacon. Furthermore, special emphasis needs to be placed on the elimination of outlier data <ref> [10] </ref>. For example, it is completely reasonable for a tagged vehicle to get off of the freeway in the middle of a trip, perhaps to buy a doughnut, and then to get back on and continue its journey. This could result in an erroneously large link travel time. <p> In short, the processing and filtering of the data to reduce outliers becomes extremely important. Link travel time estimates could form the basis for an incident detection system. Preliminary systems of this type have been investigated <ref> [10, 42, 59, 73, 74] </ref>. We review the probe-based incident detection literature in Section 3.3. Hence we cut our discussion short. 2.2.3 Video Another detection technology that has benefited from recent advances is video image processing. Two types of video systems have been developed, tripwire systems and tracking systems. <p> We believe that they came very close to the same model that we used but then chose this summary statistic approach which hides the information that we are looking for. A study that used probe vehicles to detect incidents on the freeway was done by Balke, Dudek and Mountain <ref> [10] </ref>. In that study they were trying to detect incidents by 65 looking for deviations in the travel time on links of the freeway much like the previous two studies. They gave a large group of individuals cellular phones which they carried with them to and from work.

Reference-contexts: They range in size from two or three tow trucks to the 149 truck system in Los Angeles County, which has an annual operating budget of around $24 million <ref> [11] </ref>. The premise behind deploying FSP systems is that since they are continuously 112 driving around a beat looking for incidents to assist they will be able to respond to an incident very quickly. Furthermore, the incident duration will be reduced as a result.

Reference-contexts: A tracking system is a video image processing system that attempts to track moving vehicles on the freeway over all lanes in a certain direction for 100-200 meters. From this it can deduce not only flow and speed, but also density, lane changes, acceleration, queue length and vehicle classification <ref> [12] </ref>. What is more interesting is that by identifying features on vehicles, it is possible to track vehicles from camera to camera [53]. This provides for the possibility of origin-destination estimation and incident detection. As we note in Section 2.6 below most incident detection schemes involve humans watching video cameras.

Reference-contexts: of sensor fusion algorithms for general transportation problems provide essentially the same information as loops. 79 (not specifically for incident detection) can be found in Dailey et al [27]. 4.1.2.1 Bhandari, Koppelman, Schofer, Sethi and Ivan One approach to sensor fusion for incident detection was given by Bhandari et al <ref> [13] </ref> as part of the ADVANCE Project [20]. In this approach they collected data from three different sources: fixed loop detectors, probe vehicles, and anecdotal sources. They use the term anecdotal sources to signify a host of reporting sources including cell phone reports, police reports, and emergency dispatch center reports. <p> The motivation for combining probe and loop data was the observation that most freeway systems have loop detectors that are too far apart to effectively detect incidents. They suggested that incorporating probe vehicles into the detection process might help the situation. Much like Bhandari et al <ref> [13] </ref>, Westerman et al didn't have any real data with 2 They noted that the percentage of probe vehicles in the traffic stream was likely going to be very low at first. 82 are three independent detection algorithms that are fused via a weighted sum algorithm to produce the probability of

Reference-contexts: This of course presupposes that we have actual freeway data for which we know various conditions, H 0 and H 1 . 2.3.2 Bayesian Formulation There is another formulation for the decision process contained in the Bayesian approach to statistics. The Bayesian formulation <ref> [14, 86] </ref> starts off with a decision procedure, ffi (X), where X is a random variable of observations, and x is a realization of X. The decision procedure ffi (x) is simply a procedure which picks a decision out of the range of possibilities based on the observed vector x.

Reference-contexts: This type of action falls under the realm of hypothesis testing and decision theory. In the future we will drop the obvious dependence on t. 2.3.1 Neyman-Pearson Formulation We present the general Neyman-Pearson setup for decision theory <ref> [15] </ref>. We are faced with the problem of testing a hypothesis based on measurements. We only have two hypothesis, which we call H 0 and H 1 . <p> Suppose ff and fl are the probabilities of type I and type II errors corresponding to some other choice of decision regions and suppose ff &lt; ff fl . Then fl &gt; fl fl . For a proof see <ref> [15, page 98] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: all have the same length: V h = occ Many researchers have investigated this relationship for speed and the flaws are well documented [26, 41, 66, 68]. 18 Since loop detectors have been around for a long time, researchers are familiar with the limitations and problems inherent in loop-based data <ref> [16, 64, 56] </ref>. In particular, loops are notorious for over- and under-counting vehicles, especially large trucks and motorcycles. In Section 7.3 we discuss ways to fix some common problems in loop detector data. <p> Second, the wear associated with the loops in the road is excessive. Couple this with the fact that the cabinets that control the loops are close to the freeway, and hence close to vandals, and the overall failure rate is rather high <ref> [16] </ref>. Third, even if the loop detectors are functioning, in order to get accurate measurements of speed and occupancy, crucial parameters for most algorithms, the loop detectors need to 57 be properly tuned|a process that, in our experience [77], takes a considerable amount of time and effort. <p> A fact which follows directly from the convexity of 1 x and Jensen's inequality [30, page 14]. 7.3.2 Loop Data Drop Outs It has been the experience of many researchers <ref> [16, 64, 65] </ref> that loop detector data are notoriously bad. There are consistency problems, faulty detectors, missing detectors, etc. There are two different types of missing loop data.

Reference-contexts: But video image processing appears well suited to this task. It is relatively straightforward for a video system to look at a scene of the freeway and to identify vehicles that were once moving that have come to a stop <ref> [17] </ref>. This is an area of incident detection that is ripe for simple video systems. Incident detection with tripwire systems are also being explored. For example, researchers have attempted to do incident detection with the AUTOSCOPE system [56].

Reference-contexts: In Los Angeles, the cost of the 17-mile Century Freeway was roughly $2.1 billion, or $2000/inch. In the San Francisco Bay Area the cost for the 5-mile replacement for the Cypress Freeway, which was destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, is expected be $4000/inch <ref> [18] </ref>. In addition to monetary constraints there are also social barriers to simply building more freeways. People do not want them in their backyards. The combination of cost and social constraints has proven formidable.

Reference-contexts: Sermons [73] performed a similar study of using probe vehicles to detect incidents on arterial streets but used real, instead of simulated, data. They used data from the ADVANCE <ref> [20] </ref> project in Chicago. The data were the position of the vehicle recorded every second. The vehicles were equipped with position sensors and a passenger that was recording whether there was an incident on the current link or not. <p> problems provide essentially the same information as loops. 79 (not specifically for incident detection) can be found in Dailey et al [27]. 4.1.2.1 Bhandari, Koppelman, Schofer, Sethi and Ivan One approach to sensor fusion for incident detection was given by Bhandari et al [13] as part of the ADVANCE Project <ref> [20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The one exception is probably the work by Cohen and Zetselidou <ref> [22] </ref>. They developed a software system called DAISI (French for Automatic Incident Detection by Iterative Thresholding) which performs the optimization procedure automatically. The software takes as input an incident database, the corresponding loop detector data, and a detection algorithm|basically the same setup as in Figure 2.16.

Reference-contexts: Hence an incident can be determined by the absence of a downstream compression wave during the previous 5 minutes. The resulting algorithm, California Algorithm #8, has been the de facto standard to compare against ever since. 2.4.1.2 HICOMP The High Occupancy (HIOCC) Algorithm proposed by Collins et al <ref> [23] </ref> is rather straightforward. They take fine time scale occupancy data and look for places where the occupancy is high for a couple of seconds in a row. They occupancy corresponds to the amount of time a vehicle spends over a loop detector. <p> Hence the dependence on the previous data never dies out completely. Most of the algorithms ran on 30 second data. 46 Data needed Loops used Algorithm Spd Flow Occ Single Multiple Time steps California [60] X X 2-8 HIOCC <ref> [23] </ref> X X 3-4 Willsky [89] X X X 1 McMasters [62, 63] X X X X 2 Standard Normal Deviate [24] X X X 9-15 Exponential [24] X X X 1 Box-Jenkins [5] X X 3 Low-Pass Filtering [82] X X 6-10 Neural Network [70, 84] X X X 3-10

Reference-contexts: As far as we can tell, this approach has not been pursued in the literature. 2.4 Loop-based Detection Algorithms Loop-based incident detection has been studied for many years with the first papers published in the late 60's and early 70's <ref> [24, 29] </ref>. Since that time, loop-based incident detection has seen quite a bit of development with many new ideas coming into play. In this section, we review a few of those ideas. We can break down the studies into two general groups: the model-based algorithms and the data processing algorithms. <p> These algorithms attempt to predict the value of a traffic variable one time step into the future. An incident alarm is generated if the predicted value turns out to be too different from the actual measured value. 2.4.2.1 Exponential Algorithms Cook and Cleveland <ref> [24] </ref> proposed using a technique of exponential smoothing of traffic parameters to detect incidents. Their technique involved developing a forecast of a traffic variable and seeing how it compares to what is actually measured. The forecasting procedure that they used was called double exponential smoothing. <p> Most of the algorithms ran on 30 second data. 46 Data needed Loops used Algorithm Spd Flow Occ Single Multiple Time steps California [60] X X 2-8 HIOCC [23] X X 3-4 Willsky [89] X X X 1 McMasters [62, 63] X X X X 2 Standard Normal Deviate <ref> [24] </ref> X X X 9-15 Exponential [24] X X X 1 Box-Jenkins [5] X X 3 Low-Pass Filtering [82] X X 6-10 Neural Network [70, 84] X X X 3-10 Table 2.2: Characteristics of various loop-based incident detection algorithms. <p> on 30 second data. 46 Data needed Loops used Algorithm Spd Flow Occ Single Multiple Time steps California [60] X X 2-8 HIOCC [23] X X 3-4 Willsky [89] X X X 1 McMasters [62, 63] X X X X 2 Standard Normal Deviate <ref> [24] </ref> X X X 9-15 Exponential [24] X X X 1 Box-Jenkins [5] X X 3 Low-Pass Filtering [82] X X 6-10 Neural Network [70, 84] X X X 3-10 Table 2.2: Characteristics of various loop-based incident detection algorithms.

Reference-contexts: All too often, the source is biased to only include the large incidents. For example, one study took the dispatch tow incident durations from observations of a "sky observer," which, presumably, is a helicopter <ref> [25] </ref>. It is clear that a helicopter is only going to report the rather large incidents. Note that this type of bias is in addition to the bias introduced by the oversampling problem. <p> This is attributable to the fact that they measured everything in the field. Nevertheless, they still missed the oversampling of the short duration incidents. In Chapter 8 we investigate the extent to which this oversampling has biased this study. 6.4.6 Cuciti and Janson Cuciti and Janson <ref> [25] </ref> studied the implementation of an FSP program in Colorado in 1992.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we can deduce the harmonic mean speed from the occupancy and the flow at a single loop if we assume that the cars all have the same length: V h = occ Many researchers have investigated this relationship for speed and the flaws are well documented <ref> [26, 41, 66, 68] </ref>. 18 Since loop detectors have been around for a long time, researchers are familiar with the limitations and problems inherent in loop-based data [16, 64, 56]. In particular, loops are notorious for over- and under-counting vehicles, especially large trucks and motorcycles. <p> This basic scheme is then augmented by the correlation procedure which is used as a periodic recalibration. This section of their work is similar to a combination of the work in travel time estimation via cross correlation by Dailey <ref> [26] </ref> and the work in travel time estimation via cumulative flow diagrams by Nam and Drew [58]. They also developed and analyzed an algorithm to provide estimates of average link speeds and travel times based on a system of probe vehicles that are periodically reporting their locations to a TMC. <p> It is well known that single-loop detectors do not accurately measure speed <ref> [41, 26, 58, 66] </ref>. Therefore, the calculations of delay have to rely on the loop detector flow and the probe vehicle speeds. This is not necessarily a problem 151 When there is no probe trajectory that goes through a grid we must interpolate.

Reference-contexts: There are many factors that one needs to consider to determine the appropriate set of input variables <ref> [28] </ref>. For example, how many loop detectors should we include? How many preceding time intervals should we process? Should we look at the data lane by lane, or averaged across all lanes? It is clear that sometimes available infrastructure will constrain our choices. <p> Unfortunately, neural networks require a huge amount of training data before they can do anything useful. With neural networks the number of samples, or observations, needed to adequately train the system can not be determined in advance. Therefore questions about training size and diversity become important <ref> [28] </ref>. Furthermore, since incidents are rare events, it is hard to develop the training data from anything but a simulator. For example, Ritchie and Cheu [70] use simulated data to train their neural network (and then use simulated data to test it as well).

Reference-contexts: As far as we can tell, this approach has not been pursued in the literature. 2.4 Loop-based Detection Algorithms Loop-based incident detection has been studied for many years with the first papers published in the late 60's and early 70's <ref> [24, 29] </ref>. Since that time, loop-based incident detection has seen quite a bit of development with many new ideas coming into play. In this section, we review a few of those ideas. We can break down the studies into two general groups: the model-based algorithms and the data processing algorithms. <p> They found that the three best were: 1) single station flow, 2) single station occupancy, and 3) station discontinuity. The station discontinuity is a measure, at one detector station, of how different the flows are in the various lanes. 2.4.2.2 Standard Normal Deviate Dudek et al <ref> [29] </ref> suggested that in order to identify incidents, it might be beneficial to look only at the rate of change of a traffic variable instead of looking for the variable to pass a threshold. <p> To get our deviation statistic, we simply subtract the current value from the average S k;j (t) = S k (t) S k;j (t): (4.7) Note that we could have normalized this by the standard deviation, like the Standard Normal Deviate algorithm <ref> [29] </ref>, but we chose not to. In the end, we have the value of S k;j (t) for 14 days, 18 loops, 2 directions and every 30 seconds. We also know whether each value was generated under incident-free conditions or not.

There are consistency problems, faulty detectors, missing detectors, etc. There are two different types of missing loop data.

In the first step they attempt to determine if the traffic is congested or not. To do this they define a few lines on the flow versus occupancy plot. These lines and the subsequent regions they define are given in Figure 2.14 (a).

Reference-contexts: The third test indicates an incident when the quality of flow, as defined by the deviation of the probe speed relative to the average speed over a link exceeds some threshold.

Reference-contexts: Introduction During the period 1985-1995, the number of lane miles in the U.S. increased by 3%. In the same time period, the number of vehicle miles traveled increased by 38% and the number of registered vehicles increased by 16% <ref> [39] </ref>. While the demand on the freeway system has increased dramatically, the capacity of the system has stayed pretty much the same. Predictions about the future of the freeway systems are similar [72].

Reference-contexts: The gains available from fusing diverse sources of sensory information have motivated many different research projects. While historically the largest application of this research has been military uses, specifically target identification, tracking, and battlefield control and surveillance [87], the field is branching out into non-military applications <ref> [40] </ref>, such as medical diagnosis, mobile robot maneuvering in unknown environments, and vehicle safety and control [3, 4]. In very general terms sensor fusion proceeds by transforming observed signals to progressively more abstract concepts. This multiple-level-of-abstraction approach provides a nice framework within which to think about fusion problems.

Reference-contexts: A tag can either be active, meaning it is a radio transponder that is constantly sending out a signal, or it can be passive, meaning it simply responds to a signal from a roadside beacon <ref> [42] </ref>. The interesting thing for TMCs is that these tags could have other uses as well. Specifically, the TMC could place roadside beacons, which can identify the tags driving by, in multiple locations around their freeway network. <p> In short, the processing and filtering of the data to reduce outliers becomes extremely important. Link travel time estimates could form the basis for an incident detection system. Preliminary systems of this type have been investigated <ref> [10, 42, 59, 73, 74] </ref>. We review the probe-based incident detection literature in Section 3.3. Hence we cut our discussion short. 2.2.3 Video Another detection technology that has benefited from recent advances is video image processing. Two types of video systems have been developed, tripwire systems and tracking systems.

Reference-contexts: To proceed they started with a couple of traffic flow models that represented different conditions on the freeway. For example, they proposed a model for an incident, for a pulse of traffic, etc. They used the traffic flow models proposed by Isaksen and Payne <ref> [46] </ref> which describe the evolution of density, speed and flow at each link of the freeway over time. Once they have the models, they use them to predict the state of the freeway one time step ahead under each model.

Reference-contexts: An inductive loop detector is composed of two parts: a controller cabinet and an inductive loop. An inductive loop is simply a coil of wire buried underneath a lane of the freeway <ref> [47] </ref>. Whenever a vehicle moves over an inductive loop in the road the current inside of the loop jumps. This current is then measured against some calibrated threshold value. The controller cabinet that is monitoring the inductive loop records the time of every transition of the current across the threshold.

Reference-contexts: As the freeway system approaches capacity it becomes more sensitive to delays caused by non-recurring incidents. The cost of delay on freeways caused by these incidents is significant. Some estimate that the cost will be $35 billion/year by the year 2005 <ref> [49] </ref>. As a result, the quick detection and recovery from incidents is a major goal of almost all traffic management centers (TMCs) and a focus of study of ITS research. <p> As shown in Figure 2.1, multiple studies <ref> [49, 81] </ref> have attributed most of the delay on the freeways to non-recurring congestion. These numbers have driven incidents, and the responses to them, to the center of research in transportation systems management. <p> The second problem is that they reported an extremely high percentage of lane-blocking incidents. They claim that 15% of the incidents are lane blocking compared to 3.8% for the FSP system in Skabardonis el al. [77] and 4% for Lindley <ref> [49] </ref>. If they were directly measuring the delay on the freeway then the percentage of in-lane incidents wouldn't matter. But they compute their delay by assigning a delay to an incident based on where it is located on the freeway. <p> Some estimates place the percentage of delay on the freeway due to non-recurrent incidents at 60% and rising <ref> [49] </ref>. In order to mitigate the effects of an incident, a transportation management center needs to be able to quickly detect, respond to, and clear incidents as they occur. Two of the techniques that have been developed for this purpose are automatic incident detection systems and freeway service patrol systems.

Our primary goal is to use as much off-the-shelf technology as possible and to leverage off of other advanced traveler information system (ATIS) implementations. Our approach for the infrastructure is similar to the work done by Linnartz et al <ref> [50] </ref>. The first application that we are trying to leverage is the GPS receiver. There are many PC-based applications which work in conjunction with a GPS receiver to provide the user with real-time route guidance.

Reference-contexts: Second, the modeling, processing, fusing and interpretation of data from sensors to make inferences about the environment is a difficult and sometimes arbitrary task <ref> [51] </ref>. The techniques and applications of sensor fusion are not as well developed as traditional, single sensor systems. This ambiguity in the field may discourage researchers from using the techniques. As the field develops, incident detection algorithms based on sensor fusion are starting to emerge. <p> One simply needs to demonstrate a system where the addition of probe vehicle data helps the "best" loop detector algorithm. Fortunately, since the measurements obtained from probe vehicles and loop detectors are independent, it is likely that the proper fusion algorithm will enhance the inference about an incident <ref> [51] </ref>. 4.1.4.2 Extensions to this Approach There are many possible extensions to this approach of fusing loop data and probe data.

Reference-contexts: This would change the whole tuning procedure. 4.2.6 Previous Work The work that is probably the most similar to this was done by Madanat et al <ref> [52] </ref>. In that work the authors develop a method of deciding when to respond to incidents which takes into account the costs for each possible decision. The setup that they used was one freeway link and an arterial street that was parallel to it.

Reference-contexts: From this it can deduce not only flow and speed, but also density, lane changes, acceleration, queue length and vehicle classification [12]. What is more interesting is that by identifying features on vehicles, it is possible to track vehicles from camera to camera <ref> [53] </ref>. This provides for the possibility of origin-destination estimation and incident detection. As we note in Section 2.6 below most incident detection schemes involve humans watching video cameras. A question still being addressed is whether it is possible to train computers to do the same thing.

Reference-contexts: If the costs are not static then the thresholds need to dynamically updated. This methodology is generally known as sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT) and, as a field of study, has recent received attention <ref> [54] </ref>. The similarity is that we are both trying to determine the costs associated with making specific decisions in the incident detection framework. The difference is that they are only trying to determine the local strategy.

Reference-contexts: They focus on a section of the freeway, like a line across a lane, and try to determine when a vehicle has passed over it. From observing the images when a vehicle passes, video image processing systems can deduce, flow, speed and occupancy|just like loop detectors. The AUTOSCOPE project <ref> [55] </ref> is an example of such a tripwire system. A tracking system is a video image processing system that attempts to track moving vehicles on the freeway over all lanes in a certain direction for 100-200 meters.

Reference-contexts: all have the same length: V h = occ Many researchers have investigated this relationship for speed and the flaws are well documented [26, 41, 66, 68]. 18 Since loop detectors have been around for a long time, researchers are familiar with the limitations and problems inherent in loop-based data <ref> [16, 64, 56] </ref>. In particular, loops are notorious for over- and under-counting vehicles, especially large trucks and motorcycles. In Section 7.3 we discuss ways to fix some common problems in loop detector data. <p> This is an area of incident detection that is ripe for simple video systems. Incident detection with tripwire systems are also being explored. For example, researchers have attempted to do incident detection with the AUTOSCOPE system <ref> [56] </ref>. Actually, there is a commercial product that does incident detection based on the AUTO-SCOPE system [8]. Since the AUTOSCOPE is essentially a video-based loop detector the algorithms to determine if an incident has occurred are not significantly different from the ones used for loop detectors.

Reference-contexts: While they started off in a limited capacity, in tunnels and on bridges, FSP systems have expanded to major freeways in many urban areas. Currently, FSP systems are deployed in more than 30 major metropolitan areas including Chicago, Los Angeles, Raleigh-Durham, Colorado, Houston, and the San Francisco Bay Area <ref> [57] </ref>. They range in size from two or three tow trucks to the 149 truck system in Los Angeles County, which has an annual operating budget of around $24 million [11]. <p> Most studies dealt with trying to determine a benefit-to-cost ratio. From reading their reports one could be forgiven for thinking that FSP-like systems are a great transportation system investment: estimates of benefit-to-cost ratios range from 2:1 to 36:1 <ref> [57] </ref>. But everything is not as rosy as it seems. We show in Section 6.3 that most of those studies didn't collect very much field data. Instead they relied on models and assumptions which, although reasonable, have no basis in fact. In short, they didn't look at any data. <p> An excellent summary article was written in 1994 by Morris and Lee <ref> [57] </ref>. They reviewed the statistics covering 32 different service patrol programs. They also summarized six studies that calculated detailed benefit-to-cost ratios. In Section 6.1 we develop a general framework for evaluating FSP systems. In Section 6.2 we present the problem of oversampling.

Drew. </author> <title> Traffic dynamics: Method for estimating freeway travel times in real time from flow measurements. </title> <journal> Journal of Transportation Engineering, </journal> <volume> 122(3) </volume> <pages> 185-191, </pages> <month> May/June </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, many examples of this can be found in the literature. An example of relying on theory and not on real world data is presented in the paper by Nam and Drew <ref> [58] </ref>. In that paper, Nam and Drew wanted to develop an algorithm to determine the travel time down a freeway link from cumulative flow curves. The theory tells us that the distance between the cumulative flow curves of the upstream and downstream flow is the travel time down the freeway. <p> If loops could accurately count vehicles entering and exiting a link, then a system could possibly be devised that would sound an alarm when a vehicle stops within a link. Unfortunately, loops are not that accurate and are notorious for over- and under-counting vehicles <ref> [58] </ref>. But video image processing appears well suited to this task. It is relatively straightforward for a video system to look at a scene of the freeway and to identify vehicles that were once moving that have come to a stop [17]. <p> This section of their work is similar to a combination of the work in travel time estimation via cross correlation by Dailey [26] and the work in travel time estimation via cumulative flow diagrams by Nam and Drew <ref> [58] </ref>. They also developed and analyzed an algorithm to provide estimates of average link speeds and travel times based on a system of probe vehicles that are periodically reporting their locations to a TMC. They used the probe vehicle travel time reports as an additional recalibration tool. <p> It is well known that single-loop detectors do not accurately measure speed <ref> [41, 26, 58, 66] </ref>. Therefore, the calculations of delay have to rely on the loop detector flow and the probe vehicle speeds. This is not necessarily a problem 151 When there is no probe trajectory that goes through a grid we must interpolate.

Reference-contexts: In short, the processing and filtering of the data to reduce outliers becomes extremely important. Link travel time estimates could form the basis for an incident detection system. Preliminary systems of this type have been investigated <ref> [10, 42, 59, 73, 74] </ref>. We review the probe-based incident detection literature in Section 3.3. Hence we cut our discussion short. 2.2.3 Video Another detection technology that has benefited from recent advances is video image processing. Two types of video systems have been developed, tripwire systems and tracking systems. <p> Without this automatic step in place their results are suspect. Another study that was trying to detect incidents on the freeway was done by Parkany and Bernstein <ref> [59] </ref>. The idea here is that vehicles would have automatic vehicle identification (AVI) "tags" in their vehicles that would be used for something like automatic 66 toll collection. Hence they have the ability to communicate the unique ID of the vehicle to special roadside equipment.

These include malfunctioning detectors, compression waves in heavy traffic, abnormal freeway geometries and bottlenecks.

Reference-contexts: All of the algorithms and evaluations were developed and validated using real data from the field.

Each asterisk represents an incident. <p> Therefore we present a methodology for estimating the benefit-to-cost ratio when it is difficult to determine the dispatched tow truck incident durations. We demonstrate this methodology on the I-880 data as well as on the data collected during the LA FSP Evaluation Project <ref> [65] </ref>. 8.1 Fixing the I-880 Study In this section we attempt to "fix" the I-880 FSP evaluation. Essentially we are trying to step around the oversampling of the short duration incidents. Before we begin, we review the steps that they took to obtain their benefit-to-cost ratio. <p> We demonstrated a limited comparison between the two types of delay estimation. Finally, we presented a few results on the calculation of delays for incidents from the data set collected for the LA FSP Evaluation Project <ref> [65] </ref>. In Section 8.1 we corrected the I-880 Study [77] based on the discussion in Chapter 6. We demonstrated that by considering the delay caused by all of the incidents, instead of just the assisted ones, we can step around the problem of the oversampling of the short duration incidents.

In particular, loops are notorious for over- and under-counting vehicles, especially large trucks and motorcycles. <p> But they also have the potential to do feature-based matching between successive video sites to extract link travel times. If video data provide us with high time resolution flows then we can apply a technique similar to that developed by Petty et al <ref> [66] </ref> to get link travel times. Hence we classify video as being able to provide us with data-level and feature-level information. In the sections that follow, we first examine some sensor fusion algorithms for incident detection. We then explore a few proposals of our own. <p> It is well known that single-loop detectors do not accurately measure speed <ref> [41, 26, 58, 66] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A recent report by Skabardonis et al [76] studied the performance of cellular phone calls as an incident detection device. Some results of that study are summarized 21 in Figure 2.5. The study used the incidents that were collected during the I-880 FSP Evaluation Study <ref> [67] </ref>. For the same time period they collected the cellular 911 phone calls for the same section of freeway. They identified 277 major incidents in the I-880 database and noted that only 25% of them were detected by individuals calling in with their cellular phones. <p> The most common of these is a natural bottleneck, like a change in the geometrics of the freeway or recurrent congestion. 59 3.2.1 Data Used The data that was used to develop and test our algorithm was collected from the I-880 freeway in Hayward, California <ref> [67] </ref>. That data set includes detailed loop detector data as well as probe vehicle data, and a complete incident database. The data were collected during the rush hour periods of 6:30-9:30am and 3:30-6:30pm. <p> To show this we turn to the data set from the I-880 FSP Study <ref> [77, 67, 79, 78] </ref>. The I-880 database has the most comprehensive set of incident data ever collected.

They don't state where they get their values but since they cite the Freeway Incident Management Handbook <ref> [69] </ref> earlier in the paper they might have based them loosely on that work. The final benefit-to-cost ratio that they got was 10.5. This is a good study except for the determination of the dispatched tow truck incident durations.

Reference-contexts: Since the introduction of the back propagation training algorithm, multilayer feedforward networks have become the most popular [84]. As neural networks have become popular, researchers have quickly applied the techniques to the field of incident detection <ref> [2, 45, 70, 84] </ref>. Neural network detection algorithms usually take as input the flow and occupancy measurements from a pair of loop detectors over a certain number of time steps. <p> Neural network detection algorithms usually take as input the flow and occupancy measurements from a pair of loop detectors over a certain number of time steps. For example, Ritchie and Cheu <ref> [70] </ref> used the downstream measurements over the last 5 time periods (in their case a time period was 30 seconds) and the upstream measurements over the last 3 time periods, while Stephanedes and Liu [84] used both upstream and downstream measurements over the last 10 30-second time periods. <p> Therefore questions about training size and diversity become important [28]. Furthermore, since incidents are rare events, it is hard to develop the training data from anything but a simulator. For example, Ritchie and Cheu <ref> [70] </ref> use simulated data to train their neural network (and then use simulated data to test it as well). This, of course, brings into question the validity of the simulator and whether the neural network is looking for a simulated incident or a real one. <p> [60] X X 2-8 HIOCC [23] X X 3-4 Willsky [89] X X X 1 McMasters [62, 63] X X X X 2 Standard Normal Deviate [24] X X X 9-15 Exponential [24] X X X 1 Box-Jenkins [5] X X 3 Low-Pass Filtering [82] X X 6-10 Neural Network <ref> [70, 84] </ref> X X X 3-10 Table 2.2: Characteristics of various loop-based incident detection algorithms.

Reference-contexts: While the demand on the freeway system has increased dramatically, the capacity of the system has stayed pretty much the same. Predictions about the future of the freeway systems are similar <ref> [72] </ref>. These numbers present a bleak picture: a large increase in the number of vehicles using the freeway system and a relatively small increase in the amount of capacity.

The hope is that the variability is dominated by the traffic flow conditions. They use discriminant analysis, just like in the work by Sethi <ref> [74] </ref>. They compared three different models, one with just travel time, one with travel time and running time (the amount of time spent moving), and then one based on the 1-second position data. But when they used the 1-second data, they didn't look for specific patterns like we did.

Reference-contexts: Hence, there is expected to be some benefit in fuel savings due to the FSP system. * Individual driver satisfaction. The individual drivers that get assisted by the FSP tow trucks are usually extremely grateful. This is demonstrated by the boxes of letters that FSP operators receive each year <ref> [75] </ref>. While this is good for public relations and 114 perhaps a good tool to glean more public funding, for our purposes it is not a useful measure of effectiveness. * Benefits to individual drivers. <p> Indeed it is crucial for their study because approximately two thirds of their benefit comes from the duration reduction in in-lane incidents. Without an explanation, this high quantity of in-lane incidents is suspect. 133 6.4.3 Siegfried and McCasland Siegfried and McCasland <ref> [75] </ref> evaluated the Houston FSP system, called the Motorist Assistance Patrol (MAP), from mid 1990 to mid 1991. The Houston MAP had 6 vans that were patrolling the freeways from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. It is not clear how they obtained their incident durations under the FSP system. <p> They combined data from a few different sources, one of which was published in 1969, to obtain an average duration. For the FSP-assisted incident durations they took their values from the FSP logs. They seem to have obtained their data from the same place as Siegfried and McCasland <ref> [75] </ref> because they report a detection time but they don't explain where they got it. Once they obtained the inputs, they ran the FREQ model and varied the duration of the incidents. The difference in the resulting delay provided them with the benefit. <p> All of the other studies just used previously published values with little regard for the fact that they might not be 137 Study Year Location B-C # Trucks Miles Time Fambro [33] 1976 Houston 2 3 64 24 hr/day Cambridge [1] 1990 Chicago 17 35 80 24 hr/day Siegfried <ref> [75] </ref> 1991 Houston 7 6 ? 6am - 10pm Hawkins [43] 1993 Houston 19 2 ~ 10 ?

Reference-contexts: Depending on the severity, there are usually multiple reports about an incident from different callers. It might seem that this source of data could potentially serve as the incident detection algorithm of the future. But that is not quite clear. A recent report by Skabardonis et al <ref> [76] </ref> studied the performance of cellular phone calls as an incident detection device. Some results of that study are summarized 21 in Figure 2.5. The study used the incidents that were collected during the I-880 FSP Evaluation Study [67].

Reference-contexts: All of the algorithms and evaluations were developed and validated using real data from the field. The data that were used were collected as part of the FSP Evaluation Project <ref> [77] </ref> and the Los Angeles FSP Evaluation Project [65]. This data required extensive filtering and fixing before it could be used for the algorithms described in this dissertation. <p> Hence quite a bit of research has been done to determine the benefit-to-cost ratio of FSP type systems. In Chapter 6 we review the many different ways that this has been attempted in the literature. As part of the FSP Evaluation Project <ref> [77] </ref> we collected an extremely detailed set of data. This data illuminated many facets of the FSP program that have been overlooked before. <p> The a priori distribution is also difficult to obtain. The rate of incidents is thought to vary according to many different variables: the composition of the traffic flow, the time of day, and the weather conditions, to name but a few <ref> [77] </ref>. To assess the a priori probability for an incident at a single location over time seems daunting indeed. <p> This implies that we have to select the incidents we want to try to detect. The problem with incidents is that there are so many of them. Incidents come in many different durations and cause a wide range of delays. For example, in the I-880 database <ref> [77] </ref>, for the first study period there were a total of 1210 incidents over 7.4 miles of freeway, in both directions, for 6 hours a day, over 24 days. This translates into 0.57 incidents/mile/hour. <p> Third, even if the loop detectors are functioning, in order to get accurate measurements of speed and occupancy, crucial parameters for most algorithms, the loop detectors need to 57 be properly tuned|a process that, in our experience <ref> [77] </ref>, takes a considerable amount of time and effort. Finally, and possibly most damaging, a loop detector based data collection system has only one purpose: to collect and deliver loop data. This means that the TMC has to shoulder the entire construction costs and maintenance budget. <p> We demonstrate this below. The data that we used came from the loop detectors and the probe vehicles over 14 days of the before period of the I-880 Study <ref> [77] </ref>. A detailed explanation of the data is given in Appendix A. For each day we had 6 hours of loop and probe vehicle data covering the time period from 6:30am until 9:30am and then again from 3:30pm until 6:30pm. <p> Unfortunately, we have witnessed these unsubstantiated benefits percolate down (or up) to funding decisions. In the chapters that follow, we examine in some detail the data collected from the Bay Area FSP Evaluation Project <ref> [77] </ref>. The data were collected in two rounds. The first round took place before the FSP system was operation; disabled vehicles needed to rely on dispatched tow trucks for assistance. The second round took place after the FSP system was operating. <p> In 117 short, they want to know what the benefit-to-cost ratios are on each beat. But gathering detailed field data is notoriously hard and expensive. The Bay Area FSP data set cost approximately $250K to collect <ref> [77] </ref>. <p> To show this we turn to the data set from the I-880 FSP Study <ref> [77, 67, 79, 78] </ref>. The I-880 database has the most comprehensive set of incident data ever collected. The data were collected by four probe vehicles driving around a 9.1 mile beat with 6-7 minute headways. <p> This is the most commonly used method of estimating the durations under the dispatched tow truck system. What varies from study to study is how they observe or measure this quantity. The study that did the best job of measuring this quantity was done by Skabardonis et al <ref> [77] </ref>. In that study they measured the durations directly with probe vehicles. Most studies have not gone to the field to measure this: direct measurements are difficult and costly. <p> Furthermore, it is difficult to know whether their durations contained any bias. The second problem is that they reported an extremely high percentage of lane-blocking incidents. They claim that 15% of the incidents are lane blocking compared to 3.8% for the FSP system in Skabardonis el al. <ref> [77] </ref> and 4% for Lindley [49]. If they were directly measuring the delay on the freeway then the percentage of in-lane incidents wouldn't matter. But they compute their delay by assigning a delay to an incident based on where it is located on the freeway. <p> It's not clear what effect this would have on the accuracy of the results given that most of the incidents on the freeway are less than 10 minutes in duration. 135 6.4.5 Skabardonis, Noeimi, Petty, Rydzewski, Varaiya and Al-Deek In 1993, Skabardonis et al <ref> [77] </ref> evaluated the FSP operation of a site in Hayward, California, in the San Francisco Bay area. They performed a rather unique study in that they tried to measure everything in the field. <p> Based on the discussions above, we can draw the following conclusions about the current state of FSP evaluations: 1. Nobody knows how much delay an incident causes on the freeway. Out of all of the studies that we reviewed, only the work by Skabardonis et al. <ref> [77] </ref> actually tried to measure the delay caused by an incident. <p> Trucks Miles Time Fambro [33] 1976 Houston 2 3 64 24 hr/day Cambridge [1] 1990 Chicago 17 35 80 24 hr/day Siegfried [75] 1991 Houston 7 6 ? 6am - 10pm Hawkins [43] 1993 Houston 19 2 ~ 10 ?

Table 6.3: Measurements performed in studies that calculated benefit-to-cost ratios for FSP systems. <p> A better way to visualize this data is through the marginal distributions of the 163 duration and delay. Figure 7.18 is the empirical distribution of the duration of the incidents. This distribution is similar to ones found in the I-880 database <ref> [77] </ref>. The distribution of the incident delays is given in Figure 7.19. It is interesting to note that most of the delays are zero. Around 87% of the incidents created delays less than 25 vehicle-hours. <p> This leads us directly to equation (9.24). 9.5 Numerical results We illustrate the calculation of this marginal benefit from the data collected during the I-880 FSP Evaluation Study <ref> [77] </ref>. Data were collected "before" the FSP tow trucks were in operation, and "after" they had been in operation for a few months. Table 9.1 shows the marginal benefit-to-cost ratios for the I-880 test site in the "after" case. <p> We reviewed some of the literature where researchers proposed architectures to do this and we suggested some our own. Unfortunately, the studies 198 that we reviewed didn't have any empirical results. We used the data from the I-880 FSP Study <ref> [77] </ref> to investigate one particular sensor fusion architecture. We demonstrated that it was possible, with real data, to fuse probe vehicle data and loop detector data to enhance the performance of an incident detection algorithm. <p> We demonstrated a limited comparison between the two types of delay estimation. Finally, we presented a few results on the calculation of delays for incidents from the data set collected for the LA FSP Evaluation Project [65]. In Section 8.1 we corrected the I-880 Study <ref> [77] </ref> based on the discussion in Chapter 6. We demonstrated that by considering the delay caused by all of the incidents, instead of just the assisted ones, we can step around the problem of the oversampling of the short duration incidents.

Reference-contexts: As shown in Figure 2.1, multiple studies <ref> [49, 81] </ref> have attributed most of the delay on the freeways to non-recurring congestion. These numbers have driven incidents, and the responses to them, to the center of research in transportation systems management. <p> Of course this average would have to be calculated only over the times and locations that didn't have incidents. It should be noted that Caltrans, on the other hand, defines congestion as speeds below 35 mph <ref> [81] </ref>. If this is the case then we could also define delay as only occurring when the speed drops below some threshold. We chose the former approach and use an average speed for the delay calculations.

Reference-contexts: There are many different types of neural networks including Hopfield net, the Carpenter-Grossberg classifier, Kohonen's self-organizing model, and the multi-layer network [44]. Since the introduction of the back propagation training algorithm, multilayer feedforward networks have become the most popular <ref> [84] </ref>. As neural networks have become popular, researchers have quickly applied the techniques to the field of incident detection [2, 45, 70, 84].

Reference-contexts: These activities can be reflected in the time line of a typical incident, as shown in Figure 2.2. This figure is a standard cumulative flow diagram <ref> [85] </ref> during an incident. The graph represents the total number of vehicles that have passed by the incident over time. The slopes of the lines represent flows in vehicles per lane per hour. 12 The top line is the demand on the freeway. <p> To calculate the delay savings they categorized their incidents into two bins: shoulder and in-lane. Then, for each bin, they obtained a value for f i from FHWA literature <ref> [85] </ref>. They then used this value to compute a delay for each category based on the average incident duration. Finally, they compared this to the delay resulting form increasing the incident duration by five minutes. The difference was the benefit due to the MAP.

The Bayesian formulation <ref> [14, 86] </ref> starts off with a decision procedure, ffi (X), where X is a random variable of observations, and x is a realization of X. The decision procedure ffi (x) is simply a procedure which picks a decision out of the range of possibilities based on the observed vector x.

Reference-contexts: The gains available from fusing diverse sources of sensory information have motivated many different research projects. While historically the largest application of this research has been military uses, specifically target identification, tracking, and battlefield control and surveillance <ref> [87] </ref>, the field is branching out into non-military applications [40], such as medical diagnosis, mobile robot maneuvering in unknown environments, and vehicle safety and control [3, 4]. In very general terms sensor fusion proceeds by transforming observed signals to progressively more abstract concepts. <p> At the feature level we have techniques involving Bayesian estimates, neural networks and Dempster-Schafer evidential reasoning. Finally, at the inference level we have fuzzy logic, expert systems and rule-based systems. There is literature that deals with how to structure the data fusion architecture <ref> [87] </ref>. These questions usually deal with whether data fusion should be done in a central location or in a distributed fashion. The choice of an appropriate fusion architecture is a systems engineering choice that must strike a balance between different criteria, like survivability, communications bandwidth, computing resources, funding, etc.

The first application was the development of a travel time estimation algorithm that fuses probe and loop data. They started by developing an algorithm for estimating the travel time on a freeway link based on loop detectors. <p> Therefore the statistic that we derive from each probe vehicle, is the difference between the maximum and minimum speeds on a link. This is similar to the statistic proposed|but not empirically explored|by Westerman et al <ref> [88] </ref>. A link in this case is defined as the section of road covering a single loop detector.

Reference-contexts: Compression waves, recurrent congestion, and weaving sections are all examples of this. An incident is only one case where this happens. The inability to distinguish between incident and non-incident conditions has limited the ability of this algorithm in subsequent studies. 38 2.4.1.3 Multiple Model Method Willsky et al <ref> [89] </ref> pursued a unique approach to the incident detection problem. Their approach is called the multiple model method. They noted that many algorithms have a problem with false alarms which they believed were caused by compression waves in traffic. <p> Hence the dependence on the previous data never dies out completely. Most of the algorithms ran on 30 second data. 46 Data needed Loops used Algorithm Spd Flow Occ Single Multiple Time steps California [60] X X 2-8 HIOCC [23] X X 3-4 Willsky <ref> [89] </ref> X X X 1 McMasters [62, 63] X X X X 2 Standard Normal Deviate [24] X X X 9-15 Exponential [24] X X X 1 Box-Jenkins [5] X X 3 Low-Pass Filtering [82] X X 6-10 Neural Network [70, 84] X X X 3-10 Table 2.2: Characteristics of various

Reference-contexts: To do this they had to optimize the size of the beats and the placement of the tow trucks within the beats subject to the incident rates. They are dealing with tow trucks that are stationary and are only dispatched once an incident is detected. Wilmink and Immers <ref> [90] </ref> used the model developed in [91] to analyze a specific freeway network in the Netherlands. But, once again, they were looking for an optimal place to put a stationary tow truck depending on the frequency of incidents on the freeway.

Reference-contexts: Once notified, a TMC operator can point a camera to the scene of the reported incident and verify its existence. This way they can quickly verify the presence of an incident, and hence reduce t verify . The work by Zografos <ref> [91] </ref>, which we discuss in Section 9.6, is concerned with selecting tow truck response regions on the freeway as well as determining the best placement of the tow trucks within those regions, all in an effort to reduce the response time, t response . <p> Hence, according to 195 equation (9.9), the optimum placement strategy for this beat has been achieved with two FSP tow trucks. 9.6 Previous Work Some previous work which is similar to ours was done by Zografos, Nathanail, and Michalopoulos <ref> [91] </ref>. In that work they were trying to minimize the response time of tow trucks to incidents. They were trying to do this by minimizing the time it takes for the tow truck to travel from where it is positioned to where there is an incident. <p> They are dealing with tow trucks that are stationary and are only dispatched once an incident is detected. Wilmink and Immers [90] used the model developed in <ref> [91] </ref> to analyze a specific freeway network in the Netherlands. But, once again, they were looking for an optimal place to put a stationary tow truck depending on the frequency of incidents on the freeway.
