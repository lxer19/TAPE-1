Title: Compositionality and Coercion in Categorial Grammar  
Author: Paul Buitelaar and Anne-Marie Mineur 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce coercion in Lambek calculus [7]. Coercion in natural language is studied within GL theory [13] and is named after common usage in programming language design for a similar technique [2] [5]. Essential about coercion is that it changes the compositional semantics, while it leaves the syntactic type unaltered. Because of this, a functor may take an argument that does not fit its requirements, in fact [a=b; c ` a] can be a valid inference if coercing c into b is allowed. This is very unusual in Categorial Grammar and it would imply an adjustment to its traditional Fregean view on compositionality. We also show how coercion relates to recent proposals on disjunctive categories in sign-based Lambek calculus [10], in the sense that coercion relates disjunctive syntactic types through a shared underlying lexical semantics.

Reference-contexts: In this context, qualia structure is best seen as a polymorphic type with the different qualia roles acting as parameters on the proper interpretation of the lexical semantic object that the qualia structure represents. This is an instance of what is called parametric polymorphism in the programming languages literature <ref> [2] </ref> [5] [8].

Reference-contexts: Coercion then is the generation process of the polysemous related senses that are represented in the qualia structure. 3.1 Qualia Structure GL presumes a relational model of lexical semantics <ref> [3] </ref>, which represents word meaning not by decomposing it into primitives as in lexical decomposition models (all of which go back on [6]), but by showing the relations between lexical semantic objects.

Reference-contexts: We will show that an extended notion of Fregean composition can be introduced into CG with only a slight adjustment to its basic apparatus. 5 Sign-based Lambek Calculus According to Frege <ref> [4] </ref> the meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meaning of the composing parts (the compositionality principle). That implies that the entire meaning of the compound expression is to be derived from the meaning of the composing parts, and no external semantic rules should be necessary.

Reference-contexts: This is an instance of what is called parametric polymorphism in the programming languages literature [2] <ref> [5] </ref> [8]. <p> By way of context dependent reasoning the proper type will be inferred from such a parametric polymorphic type. This is what Pustejovsky calls true coercion [15], to distinguish it from socalled implicit coercion <ref> [5] </ref>, which depends on a subset relation between types. An example of implicit coercion is the subset relation between the sorts create event and event. It may be obvious that every create event at the same time is to be seen as an event.

Reference-contexts: No flexibility, no room for new meanings, no associative interpretations are allowed. The only way to account for polymorphism that has been given so far, is by simply listing the disjunctive set of possible categories, with their fixed meanings attached to them <ref> [10] </ref>. 5.1 Conjunction and Disjunction In this section we will discuss the technique that Morrill uses for polymorphic types. <p> Similarly, a pairing of two types that will both end in a sensible lambda-term, will be connected by the _-operator when given, and by the ^-operator when required. According to Morrill <ref> [10] </ref>, however, "it appears that application to linguistic derivation requires just use of conjunction, and proof of disjunction." Or, in other words, we want only to be able to describe the case where in the course of the derivation one type turns out to be sufficient.
