Abstract: Creating freeform surfaces is a challenging task even with advanced geometric modeling systems. Laser range scanners offer a promising alternative for model acquisitionthe 3D scanning of existing objects or clay maquettes. The problem of converting the dense point sets produced by laser scanners into useful geometric models is referred to as surface reconstruction. In this paper, we present a procedure for reconstructing a tensor product B-spline surface from a set of scanned 3D points. Unlike previous work which considers primarily the problem of fitting a single B-spline patch, our goal is to directly reconstruct a surface of arbitrary topological type. We must therefore define the surface as a network of B-spline patches. A key ingredient in our solution is a scheme for automatically constructing both a network of patches and a parametrization of the data points over these patches. In addition, we define the B-spline surface using a surface spline construction, and demonstrate that such an approach leads to an efficient procedure for fitting the surface while maintaining tangent plane continuity. We explore adaptive refinement of the patch network in order to satisfy user-specified error tolerances, and demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real data.

Reference-contexts: This construction proceeds in two steps, as illustrated in Figure 3. First, a refined control mesh M x is created by subdividing M c using two Doo-Sabin subdivisions <ref> [5] </ref>. In our application M c has only quadrilateral faces, and therefore a 4 fi 4 grid of vertices in M x is associated with each face of M c as shown in Figure 3b.

Reference-contexts: Enforcing G 1 continuity between adjacent patches while at the same time fitting the patch network to the points is a challenging problem. Our B-spline reconstruction procedure adapts the previous surface reconstruction work of Hoppe et al.

Reparametrizing over a simple triangular base complex K 4 : Using the parametrization work of Eck et al. <ref> [6] </ref>, Step 2 automatically constructs from the initial mesh M 0 both a simple base complex K 4 (Figure 9e) and a continuous parametrization 4 : K 4 !

Next we present a minor modification to the method that facilitates the construction of K 2 in Step 3.

In order for the Voronoi-like partition to be dual to a triangulation, the sites are chosen to satisfy a set of 4 conditions (see <ref> [6] </ref>). Next, the method makes use of harmonic maps to construct a Delaunay-like triangular partition T 1 ; : : : ; T r (Figure 9d) that is dual to the Voronoi-like partition.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, tangent plane (G 1 ) continuity is more difficult since it involves nonlinear constraints on the control points of adjacent patches. There are two main approaches to satisfying these G 1 continuity constraints. In the first approach <ref> [23, 25] </ref>, the nonlinear G 1 constraints are approximated by introducing an additional penalty term E G 1 (d) to minimize. Unfortunately, minimizing E dist (d) + E fair (d) + E G 1 (d) requires more expensive nonlinear optimization.

Reference-contexts: Extensions to the basic fitting method We generalize the construction of M x to allow surface boundaries in K 2 . In a con struction similar to <ref> [26] </ref>, we add for each boundary edge of K 2 an additional layer of vertices to M x . To each valence m boundary vertex of K 2 we associate in M x a (2m2)-sided face if m 6= 2 and a 4-sided face if m = 2.

Reference-contexts: Our B-spline reconstruction procedure adapts the previous surface reconstruction work of Hoppe et al. [12, 13], the parametrization work of Eck et al. [6], and the B-spline construction scheme of Peters <ref> [27] </ref>, as summarized in Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 respectively. The main contributions of this paper are: * It presents a combinatorial optimization method for building a quadrilateral domain from a triangular one (Section 3.3), a crucial step in constructing the B-spline patch network. <p> B-spline fitting: Step 4 defines over each face f of K 2 a tensor product B-spline patch s f using the surface splines scheme of Peters <ref> [27] </ref> such that the patches s f collectively form a G 1 B-spline surface S. More precisely, this construction consists of two steps. First, a control mesh M x is defined by topologically subdividing K 2 . <p> Moreover, the resulting surface is only approximately tangent-plane smooth, or *-G , and the lack of smoothness is often visible in the resulting surfaces (e.g. [23]). In the second approach, often referred to as surface splines or G-splines <ref> [20, 21, 27, 28, 29] </ref>, the idea is to construct a network of triangular and/or tensor product B ezier patches from a global control mesh M x . <p> Using this approach, the surface is exactly G 1 , and the fitting process again involves solving a simple linear system, in which the unknowns are the vertex positions of M x . We have opted for the second approach, and have adapted a surface spline scheme of Peters <ref> [27] </ref>. As described in the next section, we construct over each face of K 2 a single tensor product B-spline patch s f with k = 4 and n = 11. <p> Review of Peters' scheme From a closed mesh M c of arbitrary topological type, the construction scheme of Peters <ref> [27] </ref> creates a G B-spline surface S. This construction proceeds in two steps, as illustrated in Figure 3. First, a refined control mesh M x is created by subdividing M c using two Doo-Sabin subdivisions [5]. <p> The affine combinations for setting the B ezier control points of these patches as functions of the vertices V x of M x are given in the Appendix. Peters <ref> [27] </ref> proves that the resulting collection of B ezier patches form a G 1 surface, subject to a few linear constraints on V x near those extraordinary faces for which m is even and greater than 4 (see Appendix). We denote this G 1 surface as S (V x ).

Reference-contexts: However, most methods either assume that the surface has simple topological type, or require user intervention in setting up the patch network. For instance, Dietz [4], Hoschek and Schneider [15], Rogers and Fog <ref> [30] </ref>, and Sarkar and Menq [31] assume that the surface is a single open B-spline patch (a deformed quadrilateral region), possibly with trimmed boundaries.

(An alternative solution method to this nonlinear problem is the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method, which has faster convergence rate <ref> [31] </ref>; however, our simple iterative scheme is sufficient for obtaining reasonable fits.) Fairness functional One problem with surface fitting is that the resulting surface may have unwanted wiggles.

Reference-contexts: Finding a maximum pairing of faces in K 4 then amounts to finding a maximum cardinality set E m E G of vertex-disjoint edgesan instance of the MAXIMUM MATCHING graph problem on G [18], which can be solved efficiently in O (jV G jjE G j) time <ref> [33] </ref>. We would like to obtain a complete matching: one in which all faces of K 4 are paired. Since we have constructed K 4 to have an even number of regions, a complete matching is likely to exist.
