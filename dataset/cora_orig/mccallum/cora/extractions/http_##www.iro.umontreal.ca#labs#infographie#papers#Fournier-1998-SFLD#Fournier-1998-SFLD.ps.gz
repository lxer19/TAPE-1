Abstract: The ever-changing nature of liquids makes them very difficult to model and animate. This paper addresses the simulation of one aspect of liquids, i.e. droplets running down surfaces. We present a model oriented towards a visually-satisfying simulation and efficiency. The efficiency results from the separation between the shape and the motion of a droplet. The motion accounts for all changes encountered along the path followed over a mesh of triangles. It is affected by various properties modeled as friction, adhesion, roughness, and collisions between droplets. Streaks are also added along the paths. We characterize the shape of a droplet by a small set of properties, such as volume conservation, surface tension, etc. We model them as constraints to satisfy. The shape model is mainly based on mass-springs. It is simple and efficient, and it guarantees that whatever the values of the unconstrained parameters, all produced shapes satisfy the characteristic properties, and thus, can represent different types of droplets. Rendered animations of various liquids illustrate the resulting simulation.

Reference-contexts: Our model is characterized by M radial slices, N levels, and the apex point A N+1 . Thus the model is com posed of N M + 1 point-masses.

Reference-contexts: The drops of liquid do not interact with each other, and are simply merged with the liquid volume when they fall back into it. Finally, they do not handle the flow of droplets over surfaces. The work of Dorsey et al. <ref> [7] </ref> is more closely related to our goals.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the smaller the triangles are, the more accurate solution becomes. The appearance of these streaks are discussed in Section 4. 3 Shape Generally, motion and shape are closely and mutually correlated and must be simulated globally in a single model. However, in many cases <ref> [14] </ref> such as in liquid droplets, the energy involved in the motion of the drop is much higher than the energy involved in its deformations. This means that motion can be simulated regardless of any shape consideration, but the shape must be simulated with motion inputs.

Such a representation offers several advantages in terms of generality and flexibility in order to simulate a wide spectrum of behaviors. The motion of a droplet is governed by the classical mechanics: ~ F = m~a.
