Abstract: A large collection of texts may be reached through the Internet and this provides a powerful platform from which common-sense knowledge may be gathered. This paper presents a system that contains a core knowledge base structured around WordNet, a lexical database, capable of extracting contextual information from a given input text. Such context information is then used to retrieve other texts from the Internet that relate to that context. When processed by the system, these new texts bring more information that represents an enhanced domain context for the initial text.

Reference-contexts: Then, the question is what knowledge representation method gives us access to unlimited, scalable information? In this paper we argue that the answer to this increasingly important question is natural language. 1.2 Text-based knowledge representation Sowa (Sowa 1984), Shapiro <ref> (Ali and Shapiro1993) </ref>, Iwanska (Iwanska1992) and Schubert (Schubert and Hwang1989) were among the first to suggest the use of natural language to represent knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The existent crawlers available for softbots (Kirk et al. 1995), (Shakes et al. 1996) tend to rely on heavy indexing instead of recent developments from information retrieval <ref> (Broglio et al. 1993) </ref>, (Liddy and Myaeng1993). The TBIS solution is appealing since it replaces the construction of a large knowledge base with the acquisition of knowledge via text understanding. The volume of machine readable text is growing exponentially.

Reference-contexts: Several sophisticated Internet interfaces have emerged, including SIMS (Knoblock et al. 1994), the Information Manifold at AT&T (Kirk et al. 1995) and the Internet softbot <ref> (Etzioni and Weld1994) </ref>. The use of AI techniques and of natural language methods for this purpose is yet in an incipient stage. In this paper we argued that the Internet provides a powerful platform from which common-sense knowledge can be gathered.

Reference-contexts: The development of Internet clients capable of supporting aspects of domain-independent textual inference becomes more and more desirable. Today the web is populated by several softbots (software robots as coined by Oren Etzioni <ref> (Etzioni 1996) </ref>) among the panoply of primitive, but popular information services. The existent crawlers available for softbots (Kirk et al. 1995), (Shakes et al. 1996) tend to rely on heavy indexing instead of recent developments from information retrieval (Broglio et al. 1993), (Liddy and Myaeng1993).

Reference-contexts: The next section offers more details and examples. 4 Acquisition of Contextual Knowledge 4.1 Intra-sentential local context In an extensive knowledge base like ours, it is typical to have a very large number of possible connections between two concepts <ref> (Harabagiu and Moldovan1996a) </ref>. However, only some of these connections are relevant for a text, while other connections may be relevant for another text.

Reference-contexts: This measure explains the observation that a pair of texts using the largest number of common concepts in the same semantic constructs tend to have closer contexts. In our system we use WordNet 1.5 <ref> (Miller 1995) </ref> as the core linguistic knowledge base since it has a broad semantic coverage. Bridging the glossary definitions from WordNet with textual information generates a complex knowledge infrastructure. <p> Prepositional attachments (Harabagiu1996) and case tagging integrate WordNet information. Text implicatures are recovered by the path-finding algorithm using the extended Word-Net. 2.2 Constructing a knowledge base around WordNet WordNet developed at Princeton by a group led by George Miller <ref> (Miller 1995) </ref> is a semantic dictionary in which words are searched based on conceptual affinity with other words. WordNet 1.5 is publicly available and a Java interface is reachable at http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/w3wn.html. It covers the vast majority of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from the English language.

The queries posted by the Metacrawler are accessed with shallow processing techniques, to retrieve text paragraphs that are assumed relevant. When the response text is available, its local and global contexts are determined by the inference system.

Their propagation follows in fact a trail of case constraint propagations along the knowledge base relations.
