Reference-contexts: The theory behind objective-level planning is still in its infancy, and the only existing systems work within very restricted environments, such as the table-tennis robot <ref> [And88] </ref> and Winograd's "blocks world" SHRDLU [Win72]. Task-level planning is what is being considered here, and the basic tasks which form the foundation for a task-level planning system could be said to be these: 1.

Reference-contexts: This may be done using similar techniques to recent work in the modelling of mechanisms [GM88, GM89, GM90, GMX]. Through this approach relationship between the configuration space and the workspace of the robot is more intuitive than is present methods. Then subdivision techniques <ref> [BBB87, MB90b, MB90a] </ref> can then be applied to determine subsets of this configuration space corresponding to configurations in which the robot avoids collisions with obstacles (and itself). Similar methods can be used to compute the free-space available for path planning to any desired level of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Many of the problems above remain to be explored.

Reference-contexts: There is also room for development of more elaborate computational methods. Two areas in which development could proceed are in the use of parallel processing and the creation of dynamic algorithms for the problems of exploratory and adaptive motion planning. Some parallel processing work has already been 4 done <ref> [FB92, ZM91, BL91, SG92, KAH92] </ref>, but this has concentrated more on precalculating the dynamics of the problem rather than actual path-planning. 2 Research strategy.

To go beyond representing the robot with thin rods, it is possible to model each joint of the robot by a B-spline surface, and to define the motion of each surface with respect to the joints.

Reference-contexts: Now the motions no longer sweep out ruled surfaces but instead use volumes of revolution and extrusions <ref> [Pie90] </ref>. Thus broadly similar methods can be used to above, though the computation becomes more expensive (it is still more efficient than other methods used for this problem). Now that a geometrical model has been set up, it is possible to study more complicated problems.
