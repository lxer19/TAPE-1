Title: A Causal Theory of Ramifications and Qualifications  
Author: Norman McCain and Hudson Turner 
Address: Austin, TX 78712-1188, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at Austin  
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of determining the indirect effects or ramifications of actions. We argue that the standard framework in which background knowledge is given in the form of state constraints is inadequate and that background knowledge should instead be given in the form of "causal laws." We represent "causal laws" first as inference rules and later as sentences in a modal, conditional logic C flat . For the framework with "causal laws," we propose a simple fixpoint condition defining the possible next states after performing an action. This fixpoint condition guarantees minimal change between states, but also enforces the requirement that changes be "caused." Ramification and qualification constraints can be expressed as "causal laws."

Reference-contexts: We will require every given formula constraint to hold in every possible next state, so a formula constraint functions (in this respect) as a state constraint. A standard example of a formula constraint is the formula (W alking Alive) <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: As we will see, this stronger requirement makes it possible to avoid unintended ramifications and to infer derived qualifications.

Again roughly speaking, our theory of qualifications is this: An action cannot be performed if the performance of the action implies a change that it does not cause. 1 The main points can be illustrated by the

Reference-contexts: In general, facts about what can and cannot be done by doing something else are contingent upon underlying causal connections and other relations of determination. (For a discussion of noncausal determination relations see <ref> [ Kim, 1974 ] </ref> .) State constraints say nothing about these, so it is not surprising that background knowledge in the form of state constraints should prove to be inadequate.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage of using causal laws can be illus trated using the domain introduced in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] </ref> in which there are two switches and a light. Let S = f:Up1; Up2; :Ong B = fOn (Up1 Up2)g: Then Res 3 B (E; S) contains two states: fUp1; Up2; Ong and fUp1; :Up2; :Ong. <p> Let S = f:Up1; Up2; :Ong B = fOn (Up1 Up2)g: Then Res 3 B (E; S) contains two states: fUp1; Up2; Ong and fUp1; :Up2; :Ong. The second state in Res 3 B (E; S) is anomalous, and results from the unintended ramification :Up2. In <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] </ref> and [ Kartha and Lifs-chitz, 1994 ] , this ramification is blocked by declaring Up1 and Up2 to be "in the frame" and On to be "not in the frame." By constrast, the use of inference rules in place of formula constraints makes the frame/nonframe distinction unnecessary

Imagine an ancient kingdom in which there are two blocks. Either block may be painted yellow, but by order of the emperor at most one of the blocks is permitted to be yellow at a time.
