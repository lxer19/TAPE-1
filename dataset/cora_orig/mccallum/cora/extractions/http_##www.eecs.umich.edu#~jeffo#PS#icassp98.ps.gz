Abstract: The Cohen class of time-frequency distributions for continuous signals has recently been to extended to discrete signals using both an axiomatic approach and an operator theory approach. In this paper, we investigate the formulation of several classical time-frequency distributions (Wigner, Rihaczek, Margenau-Hill, Page, Levin, Born-Jordan, spectrogram) in the discrete Cohen classes. The main result of this paper concludes that there does not exist a formulation of the Wigner distribution in all of the discrete Cohen classes.

Reference-contexts: In Table 1 we list the four types of signals along with their properties and the appropriate Fourier transform. Since the Fourier transform is linear, the discrete Fourier transforms are samples of the continuous Fourier transform under the appropriate sampling conditions. The Cohen class of time-frequency distributions <ref> [1, 2] </ref> was originally formulated for type I signals. Recently, this class has been extended to the three types of discrete signals in Table 1 using both an axiomatic approach [3, 4] and an operator theory approach [5, 6, 7]. <p> However, since the Cohen class of time-frequency distributions are quadratic rather than linear, the discrete Cohen classes are not sampled versions of the continuous Cohen class. In this paper we will present results concerning discrete versions of several classical time-frequency distributions <ref> [1, 2] </ref>: Wigner, Rihaczek, Margenau-Hill, Page, Levin, Born-Jordan, and the spectrogram. To simplify notation, we will use x () to denote signals of all types and let the context indicate the type. 2. <p> Proof. Properties (i) and (ii) limit us to TFDs in Cohen class <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Properties (iii) and (iv) constrain the kernel, respectively, to be of the form j R (; t )j 2 = 1 and R (; t ) = e f (t) for a complex function f ().

The resulting distribution is the one originally defined by Richman et al. <ref> [8, 9] </ref> and corresponds to the kernel function R (n; m) = ffi n + 2 1 m . In Figure 2a, we show an example for N = 3 where the open circles correspond to a value of one and the filled circles correspond to a value of zero. <p> For N even, there are no values of c that give a real distribu tion. 3 As a result, the type IV Wigner distribution does not exist under this definition for signals with an even length period. The distribution defined by Richman et al. <ref> [8, 9] </ref> for even length signals is compatible with neither modulations nor filtering. 6.

Reference-contexts: However, one runs into problems in attempting to discretize the kernel of the type I Wigner distribution. Straightforward dis-cretization results in: W (n; m) = ffi n which results in the discrete Wigner distribution originally posed by Claasen and Mecklenbrauker <ref> [10] </ref>. However, this type II distri bution does not satisfy the following properties: frequency marginal, Moyal formula, convolution, and modulation.

However, the type IV Wigner distribution does exist, and there exist discrete versions of several other classical distributions that satisfy the same properties as their continuous counterparts (Moyal formula, marginals, convolutions, modulations, etc.).
