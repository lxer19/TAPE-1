Abstract: We present a biologically-motivated approach to the problem of perception-based homing by an autonomous mobile robot. A three-layered self-organizing network is used to autonomously learn the desired mapping from perceptions to actions. The network, which bears some similarities to the structure of the mammalian cerebellum, is initially trained by teleoperating the robot on a small number of homing paths within a given domain of interest. During training, the connections between input sensory layer and the hidden layer as well as those between the hidden layer and the motor output layer are modified according to the well-known competitive Hebbian learning rule. By employing a population averaging scheme for computing output motor vectors, the robot can subsequently home from arbitrary locations within the domain based solely on current perceptions. We describe preliminary results based on simulation for an actual mobile robot, equipped with simple photoreceptors and infrared receivers, navigating within an enclosed obstacle-ridden arena.

Reference-contexts: of the Cerebellum While the network architecture presented above was not designed with the explicit goal of modeling any particular neurobiological structure, we briefly note in this section some striking similarities to the organization of the cerebellum (and therefore to the cerebellar model of Marr [7], the CMAC of Albus <ref> [1] </ref> and Kanerva's sparse distributed memory [5]). The cerebellum is a relatively large neuronal complex found in the mammalian brain and responsible for motor control and the coordination of muscular movements in response to sensory stimuli [4].

Reference-contexts: Recent work in behavioral robotics has shown that in many instances, the uncertainties posed by unstructured environments can be circumvented to a large extent by endowing the robot with the ability to autonomously learn navigational behaviors (for example, <ref> [3] </ref> and [6]). In the spirit of this recent trend, we present a biologically-motivated framework for the autonomous acquisition of perception-based homing behaviors in mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: The cerebellum is a relatively large neuronal complex found in the mammalian brain and responsible for motor control and the coordination of muscular movements in response to sensory stimuli <ref> [4] </ref>. Sensory inputs to the cerebellum are provided by the mossy fibers (from the cerebral cortex) which synapse on the granule cells. Thus, the mossy fibers represent the input vector ~s while the granule cells correspond to the hidden layer of Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Homing can be defined as the ability of an autonomous agent to navigate to a particular "home" location from arbitrary locations within a specific environment. Homing behaviors are almost universal in animals <ref> [10] </ref>. Assuming that complex animal behaviors emerged from pre-existing simpler ones, it is reasonable to assume that the acquisition of the homing behavior represents a significant step towards acquiring more complex navigational behaviors.
