Abstract: Functional debugging of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) has been recognized as a very labor-intensive and expensive process. We propose a new approach based on the divide and conquer optimization paradigm for the functional test pattern execution. The goal is to maximize the simultaneous controllability of an arbitrary set of the user selected variables in the design at the debugging time for facilitating the functional test pattern execution while minimizing the hardware overhead. The approach imposes minimal restriction on register sharing so that the synthesized designs will have the desired characteristic while minimizing the additional hardware overhead and minimizing the disruption of the optimization potential when scheduling, allocation and binding tasks in high-level synthesis are performed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a number of designs.

Reference-contexts: Checking if a cut is complete can be efficiently done by removing all the corresponding edges of the cut from the CDFG and running any directed graph cycle detection algorithm on the graph <ref> [1] </ref>. Replacing a variable with the output variables of all destination operations in strongly-connected components maintains the completeness of the cut.

Reference-contexts: 1 There may be more than one loop in a strongly-connected component. See an example in Figure 3. The computation is a strongly-connected component which has two loops. The problem to find an optimal complete cut for func-tional test pattern execution is NP-complete since the FEEDBACK ARC SET problem <ref> [3] </ref> can be reduced to our problem by only considering that the number of variables in the complete cut is minimized. Due to the computational complexity, we have to resort to a heuristic method to find a good solution for the problem.
