Abstract: A methodology is presented for generating compact models of substrate noise injection in complex logic networks. For a given gate library, the injection patterns associated with a gate and an input transition scheme are accurately evaluated using device-level simulation. Assuming spatial independence of all noise generating devices, the cumulative switching noise resulting from all injection patterns is efficiently computed using a gate-level event-driven simulator. The resulting injected signal is then sampled and translated into an energy spectrum which accounts for fundamental frequencies as well as glitch energy. Preliminary results demonstrate the validity of the assumptions and the accuracy of the approach on a set of standard benchmark circuits.

Reference-contexts: In general, a significant portion of this current is discharged to a ground bus through direct feedthrough, or it is injected directly into the substrate through various mechanisms <ref> [1] </ref>. The cumulative contribution of currents injected by switching gates is felt in sensitive circuits in a form of a spurious signal, referred to as switching noise. The spatial location and rate of occurrence of transitions in digital circuits are generally time-variant and difficult to characterize exactly. <p> In general, it has been found that at low and medium frequencies, typically less than 5GHz, substrate shows a resistive behavior. At higher frequencies on the contrary, the transport patterns are too complex to be accurately modeled using RC meshes <ref> [1] </ref>. The gate count of realistic digital circuits is typically in the millions. A complete extraction and detailed simulation of each individual substrate noise injector is impractical. <p> Event-driven simulation is performed on the mapped network and the resulting signal is convolved and transformed in the frequency domain. As a verification step, the layout and underlying substrate is fully extracted with Subres <ref> [1] </ref> and the injected currents are evaluated at a common sensing point using Spice. Several circuits from the MCNC91 benchmark suite have been tested using one thousand randomly generated input vectors.

Reference-contexts: Impact ionization is particularly important in sub-micron technologies, where small channel size and a reduced oxide thickness cause electric fields to exceed the critical value of 4 10 4 V =cm, thus resulting in large electron-hole pair generation. Impact ionization currents can be expressed through the following equation <ref> [4] </ref> I impact = C 1 (V ds V dsat )I d exp C 2 t ox x j V ds V dsat ! Device level simulations have been performed to extract parameters C 1 ; C 2 using the 2-D device level simulator Pisces [5]. <p> A second class, referred to as high-resistivity substrate, is composed of a uniformly doped layer with a resistivity coefficient of 20 ffi 50 cm. Recently, low-resistivity substrates have been widely adopted for desirable latch-up suppression properties <ref> [4] </ref>. In general, it has been found that at low and medium frequencies, typically less than 5GHz, substrate shows a resistive behavior. At higher frequencies on the contrary, the transport patterns are too complex to be accurately modeled using RC meshes [1].

Reference-contexts: expressed through the following equation [4] I impact = C 1 (V ds V dsat )I d exp C 2 t ox x j V ds V dsat ! Device level simulations have been performed to extract parameters C 1 ; C 2 using the 2-D device level simulator Pisces <ref> [5] </ref>. These parameters have been then used in standard Spice models. There exist two main classes of substrates: one referred to as low-resistivity substrate which consists of a thick, high-resistivity epitaxial layer (d ' 10m, ' 10 ffi 15 cm) and a low-resistivity bulk ( ' 1m cm).

Reference-contexts: The simulator produces the switching activity of each signature class as an output Gate Table. The notation used in Figure 3 is the same as the one used in <ref> [6] </ref>. Let N be the set of nodes of the Boolean network, f n the logic function associated with node n, and y n the logic variable associated with n.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, for each gate g n two signature classes, one for the rise and one for the fall transition are necessary. simulate performs internally an event-driven gate level simulation based on a pure bounded wire delay model <ref> [7] </ref>: in event-driven simulation each change in value of a wire in the circuit is regarded as an event, while a pure bounded wire delay model implies that there is exactly one delay element per gate input.

Reference-contexts: The tools are implemented in C/C++ running under the UNIX operating system. Figure 4 shows the flow adopted for the testing of the methodology. A Boolean network is mapped onto a given technology using the synthesis tool Sis <ref> [8] </ref> and compiled in standard cell style within the Octtools environment. Event-driven simulation is performed on the mapped network and the resulting signal is convolved and transformed in the frequency domain.
