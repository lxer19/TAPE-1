Abstract: We use concepts from communication theory to characterize information hiding schemes: the amount of information that can be hidden, its perceptibility, and its robustness to removal can be modeled using the quantities channel capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, and jamming margin. We then introduce new information hiding schemes whose parameters can easily be adjusted to trade off capacity, imperceptibility, and robustness as required in the application. The theory indicates the most aggressive feasible parameter settings. We also introduce a technique called predistortion for increasing resistance to JPEG compression. Analogous tactics are presumably possible whenever a model of antici pated distortion is available.

Reference-contexts: The hiding methods presented in this paper are oblivious, meaning that the message can be read with no prior knowledge of the cover image. Other oblivious schemes have been proposed <ref> [BGM91, Cor95] </ref>, but the information-theoretic limits on the problem have not been explicitly considered. We make comparisons between our hiding schemes and these other oblivious schemes later in the paper. <p> Then to recover the message, each bit can be demodulated twice, once with (1)(1) and once with (1)(1). Whichever correlation value is higher gives the bit's value. This dual rail scheme also has advantages for carrier recovery. Bender et al.'s Patchwork algorithm <ref> [BGM91] </ref> for data hiding in images can be viewed as a form of spread spectrum in which the pseudo-random carrier is sparse (is mostly 0s) and with the constraint that its integrated amplitude be zero enforced by explicit construction, rather than enforced statistically as in ordinary spread spectrum schemes.

Reference-contexts: The final quantized coefficients a ij are found by dividing each S ij by a quantization factor q ij (where each q ij is greater than one, since the purpose of the JPEG representation is to decrease the file size), and rounding toward zero <ref> [BH93] </ref>: a ij = b q ij The cosine expansion is a linear operation, and therefore obeys superposition, so (as long as q ij &gt; 1) we need only show that for any real numbers f and g, 1 bf + gc bfc bgc 1.

Reference-contexts: can be invoked to quantify the trade-offs between the amount of information that can be hidden, the visibility of that information, and its robustness to removal. 1.2 Relationship to other approaches In our framework, it becomes obvious why cover image escrow hiding schemes such as those presented in [CKLS] and <ref> [BOD95] </ref> have high robustness to distortion. In cover image escrow schemes, the extractor is required to have the original unmodified cover image, so that the original cover image can be subtracted from the stego-image before extraction of the embedded message.

Reference-contexts: The hiding methods presented in this paper are oblivious, meaning that the message can be read with no prior knowledge of the cover image. Other oblivious schemes have been proposed <ref> [BGM91, Cor95] </ref>, but the information-theoretic limits on the problem have not been explicitly considered. We make comparisons between our hiding schemes and these other oblivious schemes later in the paper. <p> For this scheme to work, at least one value of the embedded image must be TRUE and one FALSE. In the version of direct sequence data hiding presented in <ref> [Cor95] </ref>, a similar problem is avoided by including 0101 at the beginning of each line. A more sophisticated scheme would be to use a "dual-rail" representation in which each i is broken in two pieces and modulated with (1)(1) to represent FALSE and (1)(1) to represent TRUE. <p> Tricks analogous to this are probably possible whenever the information hider has a model of the type of distortion that will be applied. Note that this version of predistortion cannot be applied to our next scheme, or to the version of direct sequence spread spectrum in <ref> [Cor95] </ref>, because in these schemes carriers overlap in space and therefore interfere. 3.3 Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum This scheme produces perceptually nice results because it does not create hard edges in the space domain.
