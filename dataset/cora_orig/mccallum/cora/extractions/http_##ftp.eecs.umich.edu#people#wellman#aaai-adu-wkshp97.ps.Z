Abstract: Qualitative probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian network often reveals tradeoffs: relationships that are ambiguous due to competing qualitative influences. We present two techniques that combine qualitative and numeric probabilistic reasoning to resolve such tradeoffs, inferring the qualitative relationship between nodes in a Bayesian network. The first approach incrementally marginalizes nodes in network, and the second incrementally refines the state spaces of random variables. Both provide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lower computational cost than application of purely numeric methods.

Reference-contexts: Since pure qualitative inference can often be substantially more efficient than its numeric counterpart (e.g., in methods based on infinitesimal probabilities (Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992) or ordinal relationships <ref> (Druzdzel & Henrion 1993) </ref>), it is worth exploring any opportunities to exploit qualitative methods even where some numeric information is required. <p> Inference and Tradeoffs Given a QPN, we may infer the effects of the change in the value of one variable on the values of other variables of interest. The inference can be carried via graph reduction (Wellman 1990), or qualitative propagation techniques <ref> (Druzdzel & Henrion 1993) </ref>. If we are fortunate, we may acquire decisive answers from the inference algorithms. Often, however, the results of such qualitative reasoning are ambiguous. <p> Algorithm 1 ITOR (decision,target,strategy) 1. Remove nodes that are irrelevant to the query about decision's influence on target (Shachter 1988). 2. Attempt to answer the query via qualitative infer ence <ref> (Druzdzel & Henrion 1993) </ref>. 3. If the answer to the query is decisive, exit; otherwise continue. 4. Select a node to reduce according to strategy, perform the node reduction, and calculate the qualitative abstractions of the transformed relationships. Return to Step 2. <p> The optimal strategies for the respective tasks will differ, in general. For example, a node that is very expensive to reduce at certain stage of the evaluation might be the best prospect for resolving the tradeoff. We exploit intermediate information provided in qualitative belief propagation <ref> (Druzdzel & Henrion 1993) </ref> in determining which node to reduce next. If we can propagate the decisive qualitative influence of the decision node D all the way to the target node T , we will be able to answer the query.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Researchers in uncertain reasoning regularly observe that to reach a desired conclusion (e.g., a decision), full precision in probabilistic relationships is rarely required, and that in many cases purely qualitative information (for some conception of "qualitative") is sufficient <ref> (Goldszmidt 1994) </ref>. In consequence, the literature has admitted numerous schemes attempting to capture various forms of qualitative relationships (Wellman 1994), useful for various uncertain reasoning tasks.

Reference-contexts: Even in such cases, qualitative models may have benefits for explanation or justification <ref> (Henrion & Druzdzel 1991) </ref>, as they can indicate something about the robustness of the conclusions (put another way, they can concisely convey broad classes of conclusions). mary reason that qualitative methods have not seen much use in practical applications of uncertain reasoning to date.

Reference-contexts: There are other approaches that make use of numerically specified knowledge in qualitative inference. Some of them are different from ours in that they do not assume the complete availability of the numerical information <ref> (Kuipers & Berleant 1988) </ref>. The incremental approaches we propose in this paper provide systematic ways to resolving qualitative tradeoffs at potentially lower computational cost than fully precise methods. Empirical results suggest that incremental tradeoff resolution can provide savings for some networks.

Reference-contexts: The ITOR algorithm differs from VE in the strategy for elimination ordering, and of course in the stopping criterion. Parsons and Dohnal discuss a semiqualitative approach for inference using Bayesian networks <ref> (Parsons & Dohnal 1993) </ref>. The basic idea is similar to state-space abstraction. However, the center of their work is to design calculus for computing the the probability intervals of variables.

Reference-contexts: The third section explains the incremental marginalization approach, followed by the experimental results. We then discuss the state-space abstraction approach, and conclude with a brief comparison of our approaches with some others. Qualitative Probabilistic Networks Qualitative Influences Qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs) <ref> (Wellman 1990) </ref> are abstractions of Bayesian networks, with conditional probability tables summarized by the signs of qualitative relationships between variables.

Reference-contexts: Initial experiments with incremental marginalization suggest that nontrivial savings are possible, but definitive evaluation of both methods awaits further empirical and theoretical investigation. The incremental marginalization approach bears some similarity to symbolic probabilistic inference, as in the variable elimination (VE) algorithm <ref> (Zhang & Poole 1996) </ref>, in that we sum out one node from the Bayesian network at a time. The ITOR algorithm differs from VE in the strategy for elimination ordering, and of course in the stopping criterion.
