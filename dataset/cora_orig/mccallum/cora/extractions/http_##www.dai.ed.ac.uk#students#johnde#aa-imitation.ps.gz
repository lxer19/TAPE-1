Abstract: In this paper we examine the issues involved in selecting a set of perceptuo-motor primitives to be used in an imitation learning framework. We advocate a strong link between perception and action in imitation, and based on neurophysiological and psychophysical data, we present a set of primitives for movement imitation. We describe our implementations of these primitives on a humanoid simulator with dynamics, and discuss how learning by imitation can take place in such a framework.

Reference-contexts: These data indicate that, at some level, perceptual and motor systems share the same representational substrate, supporting and extending Positron Emission Tomography data <ref> (Decety et al, 1994) </ref> which indicated that passive observation of movements and mental imagery share common neural mechanisms with aspects of motor control, including planning. 3 A set of primitives The idea behind movement primitives is that the complex and high-dimensional articulated control problem could be addressed by structuring the motor

Reference-contexts: Viviani and Stucchi (1992) among others, have shown that actions are perceived under the strong influence of the motor capabilities of the observer. Even more persuasively, Rizzolatti and his colleagues <ref> (Rizzolatti et al, 1996) </ref> have found "mirror" neurons in the pre-motor cortex of monkeys, that are activated both by the perception and execution of actions.
