Title: Using Skeletons for Nonholonomic Path Planning among Obstacles  
Author: Brian Mirtich John Canny

Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California  
Abstract: This paper describes a practical path planner for nonholonomic robots in environments with obstacles. The planner is based on building a one-dimensional, maximal clearance skeleton through the configuration space of the robot. However rather than using the Eu-clidean metric to determine clearance, a special metric which captures information about the nonholonomy of the robot is used. The robot navigates from start to goal states by loosely following the skeleton; the resulting paths taken by the robot are of low "complexity." We describe how much of the computation can be done off-line once and for all for a given robot, making for an efficient planner. The focus is on path planning for mobile robots, particularly the planar two-axle car, but the underlying ideas are quite general and may be applied to planners for other nonholonomic robots.

Reference-contexts: The SFP balls about points on the skeleton are as large as possible, and fewer jumps are required to move along the skeleton resulting in less complex final paths. Bellaiche has used SFP balls to determine lower bounds on path complexities in the presence of obstacles <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Roadmaps <ref> [4] </ref> and Voronoi diagrams have been used previously to simplify path planning. What is novel about our approach is the particular skeleton which is constructed and how it is built. It is a maximal clearance skeleton based on a special metric that makes it especially suited to non-holonomic motion planning. <p> lookup table the deriva tives of d SF P (s; CO) are estimated by their Euclidean analogues. 6 The Planning Algorithm Once the metric to be used for building the maximum clearance skeleton and its implementation have been defined, the planning algorithm becomes an application of Canny's general roadmap algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. We now give a brief description of the algorithm. The roadmap algorithm is similar to a plane sweep algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The above ideas are only an overview of the roadmap algorithm.

Planning for this system exhibits the same basic difficulties inherent in more complex nonholonomic systems, and the shortest paths for the planar car have been studied extensively.

Reference-contexts: Jacobs and Canny have given an algorithm for path planning for a car-like robot amidst obstacles based on reducing the set of a smooth trajectories to a sufficient set of canonical trajectories <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The building blocks for their trajectories are "Dubins paths" while our trajectories for the car-like robot are constructed from "Reeds-Shepp paths," the major difference being that the latter may contain reversals along the path between two points.

Reference-contexts: Our work most closely parallels the recent work of Jacobs, Laumond, and Taix. They have developed a two-stage planning strategy for the car-like robot <ref> [9] </ref>. First a path is found for the associated holonomic system (obtained by removing the nonholo nomic constraints), and then this initial path is approximated by feasible path segments. Our planner is also based on following a nonfeasible path (a portion of the skeleton).

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, it is still possible to define some more general measure of path complexity. Lafferriere and Sussman have shown that a nilpotentizable system can be steered between two configurations by following a finite number of subpaths, where only one of the control inputs is non-zero over any one subpath <ref> [11] </ref>. The number of subpaths is bounded by some constant M for the particular system. For a nonholonomic robot representable as a nilpotentizable system, one can thus choose the path library to comprise all paths which are composed of M or fewer such path segments.

Reference-contexts: For our planner the important consequence of Reeds and Shepp's work is that the SFP metric is computable for the planar car. We received a subroutine for computing Reeds-Shepp paths from Michel Taix, who wrote the C code as part of a complete planner for car-like robots <ref> [16] </ref>. Figure 7 shows the level curves of the 0 R lookup table for the car-like robot (in generating this table the car was assumed to be a point, although this assumption is not necessary).

Reference-contexts: Planning for the point robot in configuration space is equivalent to planning for the actual robot in physical space <ref> [17] </ref>. An underlying assumption in the classic version of this problem is that (ignoring obstacles) the point can locally move in any direction of configuration space, that is it can move at any velocity in the tangent space of the manifold of configurations.

Reference-contexts: Murray and Sastry developed a method of steering systems with nonholonomic constraints between arbitrary configurations using sinusoidal control inputs <ref> [19] </ref>. Although their method assumes no obstacles, it provides a simple and efficient means for generating paths and can certainly be incorporated into a planner which take obstacles into account. Our work most closely parallels the recent work of Jacobs, Laumond, and Taix.

Reference-contexts: Reeds and Shepp have proven that in the absence of obstacles the shortest path for the car robot never contains more than two reversals, which are places where the car changes direction from forward to backward or vice-versa <ref> [20] </ref>. As any practiced parallel parker can attest, having to change directions many times does not make for a desirable path. Since it is also desirable to drive as little as possible, path complexity for the car like robot increases with path length and number of reversals. <p> In fact Reeds and Shepp have completely characterized the shortest paths between any two configurations of the planar car, and an algorithm exists for computing these paths <ref> [20] </ref>. Briefly, the shortest paths consist of five or fewer path segments, each segment being a straight line or a turn with a radius of curvature equal to the minimum turning radius of the car.
