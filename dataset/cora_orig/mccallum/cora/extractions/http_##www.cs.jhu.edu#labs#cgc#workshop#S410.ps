Abstract: We solve two problems posed by Goodman and Pollack in [GP84]. Given a planar finite set of points fp 1 ; ; p n g, for every pair 1 i &lt; j n choose a direction for the unique line l ij going through the points p i and p j . We associate a cluster of stars by recording, for all i, the circular order in which the directed lines through p i and p j ; j 6= i occur around p i . Formally, a cluster of stars is given by a set of n signed permutations 1 ; ; n , i = ( i 1 ; ; i The problems are: 1. to characterize and recognize efficiently the sets of signed permutations which arise as clusters of stars from generalized configurations of planar points with oriented supporting pseudo-lines, and 2. to find efficient ways of constructing (drawing) wiring diagrams for a generalized configuration of points associated with a cluster of stars, without going through a double-dualizing process using pseudo-line arrangements and Levy's Enlargement Lemma. As a biproduct we get an O(n 2 ) space data structure constructible in O(n 2 ) time, representing the order type of a (generalized) configuration of points and from which the orientation of each triple can be recovered in constant time, a problem posed in [EHN].
