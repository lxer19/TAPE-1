Abstract: We present the overall goals of our research program on the application of high performance computing to remote sensing applications, specifically applications in land cover dynamics. This involves developing scalable and portable programs for a variety of image and map data processing applications, eventually integrated with new models for parallel I/O of large scale images and maps. Here, we focus on our research in classification of remotely sensed images, describing new parallel algorithms for classification using Markov Random Fields and for classifying segmentations of images using a multistage decision procedure.

Reference-contexts: We are developing a parallel C++ code for constructing the hierarchical segmentation using object-oriented versions of the CHAOS run time support libraries developed at the University of Maryland <ref> [1] </ref>. We focus, instead, on issues in parallelizing the classification step applied to an arbitrary level of the pyramid, corresponding to a fixed partition of the image pixels into regions. There are two possible ways to parallelize the classification step: 1.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is essentially the one described in the paper by Burt and Adelson <ref> [2] </ref>, with a few differences. The following is a brief summary of the algorithm. The first step is the building of a pyramid of low-pass filtered versions of the image, obtained by applying a convolution operator at every alternate point. <p> In this implementation the operator at every such point was chosen as the locally symmetric 5x5 kernel function that resembles the Gaussian function as was suggested in <ref> [2] </ref> with the peak value of the Gaussian kernel chosen as 0.4. The Laplacian pyramid of images is then obtained by subtracting each pixel at level i+1 of the Gaussian pyramid from their corresponding parent pixel at level i, where the resolution decreases with increasing i.

Reference-contexts: GMRF models have been extensively used to model, synthesize and classify textures <ref> [3] </ref>. MRF models provide a convenient tool to characterize prior beliefs about various image features and to combine prudently the apriori knowledge and information contained in the observed data. One of the drawbacks of MRFs is that the associated optimization schemes are iterative and computationally expensive.

Reference-contexts: One of the drawbacks of MRFs is that the associated optimization schemes are iterative and computationally expensive.

We present a multiresolution GMRF model based on local conditional distribution invariance approximation. The scheme involves the following steps: 1. Different classes in the image are modeled by GMRF processes.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm was run on both a CM5 and an In-tel Paragon. Here, we present only the results on the Paragon an extended discussion can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. The results are illustrated in Tables 1 to 2. These tables show, as a function of number of processors and data distribution model, the computation, communication and scheduling time for the pyramid algorithm for a 768x768 and 1536x1536 image, respectively.

Reference-contexts: As a first step towards developing a parallel implementation of this algorithm, we studied a simpler, multiresolution algorithm that constructs what is called a Laplacian pyramid. In order to support the implementation of this code, we recently extended the multiblock PARTI system <ref> [8] </ref> to support the diagonal neighbor communications needed to develop typical local operations in image processing (most scientific computations are performed using only horizontal and vertical adjacencies). The algorithm is essentially the one described in the paper by Burt and Adelson [2], with a few differences.
