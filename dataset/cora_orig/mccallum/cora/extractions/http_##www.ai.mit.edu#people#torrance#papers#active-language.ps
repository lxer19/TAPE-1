Title: Two Case Studies in Active Language Use  
Author: Mark C. Torrance 
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
Abstract: This paper describes two examples of the author's work on systems that take this reactive approach to connect language use to action in the world. It goes on to point out some differences in the approaches that are motivated by their different tasks, to point out areas in which they are weak, and to draw some conclusions about the benefits of a reactive approach to language.

Reference-contexts: OZ can perhaps best be understood as a production system coupled with some persistent goals and others that become activated by sensed conditions or as a result of the firing of productions. A more complete description of this architecture can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and [4]. After speech recognition and parsing provide a syntactic parse tree of the utterance, this tree is passed to a semantic interpretation module, which produces a list of speech acts. The most important speech acts are command and presupposition.

Reference-contexts: The mobile robot itself, built at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center by Jonathan Con-nell <ref> [2] </ref>, runs a reactive architecture that allows it to avoid obstacles, follow corridors, and recognize certain landmarks in its environment. Our system supports typewritten natural language input and output, with the processing of this language handled by a reactive system similar to the one used in the MERL Learning Project.

Reference-contexts: We have built a system <ref> [5] </ref> capable of performing well on the communicating mobile robot task. This task has driven the design of a system that we believe forms an appropriate basis for more complex natural language abilities. <p> We believe we have good solutions to some of the problems of spatial reasoning given only a rop-based description of the world; these are discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 Discussion We have described two examples of research projects involving implemented systems that use language in a sit uated way. Reactive production systems provide an effective architecture for robot control and navigation.
