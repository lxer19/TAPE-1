Abstract: A new network architecture, called MultiS-Net, is proposed to provide packet-switched services to a large number of bursty users connected to a multichannel broadcast medium in a local environment. An example physical network would consist of a passive star coupler to which nodes are connected via two-way fibers, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is used to create multiple, parallel optical channels. A separate channel, called control channel, is established to coordinate data packet transmissions on the other channels (called data channels). To allow low network interfacing costs, each node in MultiS-Net is only equipped with a single tunable transmitter and a single tunable receiver, both of which are responsible for data channel access as well as control channel access, and both of which are rapidly tunable [1]. MultiS-Net incorporates a simple medium access mechanism, and it can also achieve high system throughput. In addition, MultiS-Net is scalable, i.e., it can accommodate a variable number of nodes as well as time-varying load.

Reference-contexts: To reduce network interfacing cost, each node is only equipped with a single tunable transmitter and a single tunable receiver, both of which are responsible for access to the control channel as well as the data channels, and both of which are rapidly tunable <ref> [1] </ref>. According to the nomenclature in [8], this is referred to as the CC T T T R structure. Note that, since a node is equipped with only one receiver, it cannot constantly monitor the control channel all the time, viz. when it is receiving information from a data channel. <p> Length of the data part is equal to the transmission time of a fixed-length data packet. Transceivers' tuning time from one channel to another is assumed constant and is equal to the length of the tuning part in a data slot. By employing rapidly tunable transceivers <ref> [1] </ref>, the tuning part is assumed to be much shorter than the data part, which means that the bandwidth loss during the tuning part is negligible. A data slot duration on the control channel is divided into a control part and a tuning part.

Reference-contexts: To analyze the performance of MultiS-Net, we first formulate a multi-dimensional Markov model. Since it is computationally prohibitive to directly solve the model, we utilize the equilibrium point analysis (EPA) technique to analyze the model at the equilibrium point <ref> [2] </ref>. By assuming that the system is always at the equilibrium point, the average delay and system throughput can be obtained without calculating the state transition probabilities. <p> With the nonpersistency assumption (A4), is a Markov chain with finite state space. diagram. 3.2 Equilibrium Point Analysis The exact analysis of the above multi-dimensional Markov chain would involve calculations of the state transition matrix, which is computationally prohibitive. We apply the equilibrium point analysis (EPA) <ref> [2] </ref> method to analyze our system performance in terms of average throughput and average data packet delay under an equilibrium point, defined as: n = (N B ; N P R 1 ; :::; N P R R ; N P Q 1 ; :::; N P Q R ; N

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a promising means to carve up the entire usable optical bandwidth into multiple noninterfering wavelength ranges (WDM channels) <ref> [3] </ref>. Many schemes have been proposed for local lightwave networks using WDM [8]. The MultiS-Net architecture proposed here is a multichannel, single-hop, local lightwave network with a separate control channel for medium access control.

Reference-contexts: This coordination is conducted through the transmission of a control packet on the control channel before a data packet can be transmitted on some data channel. In contrast to the receiver collision avoidance (RCA) scheme <ref> [4] </ref>, the protocol in MultiS-Net is synchronous in the sense that data packets can only be transmitted at the beginning of a data slot. 2.2.1 Data Structures At each node in MultiS-Net, the following data structures are maintained to support the medium access protocol. * Reception Scheduling List (RSL). <p> The maximum throughput is about 81% of the total data channel capacity, which is very high compared with those of all previously proposed schemes employing the CC T T T R structure <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. We will later show that this high throughput can be further improved by employing proper system configurations. Note that the simulation results match very well with the analytical results until the maximum throughput is reached.

Reference-contexts: Second, in MultiS-Net, no global information needs to be maintained across all of the network nodes at all times, while in Lu's scheme, a global queue is maintained by all the nodes at all times. See <ref> [5] </ref> for elaboration. An additional feature of MultiS-Net is that it takes only one round-trip propagation delay to detect the RCDP (receiver colli sion on data packet) through condition S2 when a control packet returns. In Lu's scheme, however, it takes two round-trip propagation delay to detect this problem. <p> When the system is overloaded, i.e., when the throughput begins to decrease after reaching its peak due to increasing offered load, the analytical results and the simulation results are found to slightly shift apart. See <ref> [5] </ref> for an explanation. Since the accuracy of the analytical model has been verified by simulation results, we will only show the analytical results for the rest of the examples.

Reference-contexts: As a result, a global reservation approach is infeasible here. However, MultiS-Net is able to achieve high system throughput, as in some global reservation schemes, viz. <ref> [6] </ref>, by incorporating an efficient access mechanism which is based on only partial information on two communicating nodes. To analyze the performance of MultiS-Net, we first formulate a multi-dimensional Markov model. <p> Otherwise, the node tunes its receiver to the control channel during the tuning part of data slot y. 2.3 Discussion and Comparison Here, we discuss several distinct features of MultiS-Net and compare them with those of Lu's scheme <ref> [6] </ref>. First of all, each node in MultiS-Net is only equipped with a single tunable transmitter and a single tunable receiver, while Lu's scheme requires a separate transmitter and a separate receiver to access the control channel, in addition to the tunable transmitter and the tunable receiver. <p> From <ref> [6] </ref>, given that i control packets arrived in a data slot, the average number of control packets without the RCDP problem (i.e., satisfying condition S2) is g (i) = M 1 1 M 1 M (M 1) (9) Let J be the number of control packets arriving in a data slot <p> We also analyze the effects of different system parameters (R, p, W, and V) and compare the performance of MultiS-Net with that of Lu's scheme <ref> [6] </ref>. Curves in Figs. 3 through 5 are complete in the sense that they cover the entire range of offered load from = 0 (lower bound on packet delay) to = 1. W=4, p=0.2, and R=10, 15, 20. <p> To compare the performance of MultiS-Net with Lu's scheme, we consider in Fig. 5 systems with M=120, W=4, R=2, and p=0.6. Results for Lu's scheme are obtained from <ref> [6] </ref> with V=10, and we choose V=10 and V=14 for MultiS-Net. With the same value of V (V=10), the maximum throughput under MultiS-Net is slightly lower than that the under Lu's scheme. <p> The medium access protocol is highly efficient, and it is based on partial information on two communicating nodes. Specific comparisons with Lu's scheme <ref> [6] </ref> were made. We note that MultiS-Net has the advantages of lower NIU cost, less protocol processing time, and easier scalability in the number of nodes, while providing the same performance levels to users and requiring the same quality of tunable transceivers.

On each data channel, a data slot consists of two parts: a data part and a tuning part.
