Abstract: Most traditional time series models are global models based on local time information: they assume that the state can be fully and locally (in time) characterized with a finite embedding space. Prediction then amounts to simple regression. Unfortunately, there are many situations in which simple regression is not sufficient to model the temporal structure in a time series. We here introduce an architecture that we call Hidden Markov Experts. It is based on Hidden Markov Models used in speech recognition research. By introducing the concept of hidden states, Hidden Markov experts model time dependency of time series explicitly as a first-order Markov model with transitions between these hidden states. Within each state, local models are applied to estimate the probability density, which can be linear or nonlinear depending on the situation. This paper first discusses the statistical framework and the learning algorithm of Hidden Markov experts, then applies them to daily S&P500 data and to high frequency currency exchange rate data. The Hidden Markov Experts have better profit than the linear and nonlinear global models. The volatilities of the time series can be characterized by the hidden states.

Reference-contexts: This is a reasonable assumption for modeling the complex financial market and the influence of different kind of economic indicators. Our extension can be compared to Bengio and Frasconi's "Input Output Hidden Markov Model," using a recurrent mixture of experts to estimate the transition probabilities <ref> [Bengio and Frasconi, 1996] </ref>. The recurrent architecture and many parameters lead to problems in convergence and overfitting. The problem is that we have no target for the transition probabilities. Here we provide a new and simpler way to implement the idea of nonstationarity based on Hidden Markov Experts.

We model these data with three experts all using five lagged values of the time series as the input to predict the next value. We compare the results with a global linear model (the AR model) and a global nonlinear model (a feed-forward neural network).

Reference-contexts: HMMs have been widely used in the field of speech recognition where context is important [Rabiner, 1989]. It can also be used in modeling the time dependency of regime switching. Related work in this field is Hamilton's regime switching model <ref> [Hamilton, 1990] </ref>. However, in Hamilton's work the regions or the states can be directly estimated from the current observation, while in Hidden Markov Experts, the states are hidden from the observation and depend on the whole history of observations.

Reference-contexts: There are several variations of Hamilton's work on regime switching, see Chapter 22 in <ref> [Hamilton, 1994] </ref>.
