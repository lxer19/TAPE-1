Reference-contexts: We thus have 15 candidate predictors of crime rate (Table 3). As in the original analyses, all data were transformed logarithmically. Standard diagnostic checking <ref> (e.g. Draper and Smith, 1981) </ref> did not reveal any gross violations of the assumptions underlying normal linear regression. All possible models were assumed to be equally likely a priori. To implement Occam's Window, we started from the null model and used the "Up" algorithm only.

Reference-contexts: Within this framework, we assess predictive performance using two strategies. The first measure of predictive ability is the logarithmic scoring rule of Good (1952) which is based on the conditional predictive ordinate <ref> (Geisser, 1980) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A complete Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models when making inferences about quantities of interest. Indeed, this approach provides optimal predictive ability <ref> (Madigan and Raftery, 1994) </ref>. In many applications however, this averaging will not be a practical proposition and here we present two alternative approaches. First we extend the Bayesian graphical model selection algorithm of Madigan and Raftery (1994) to linear regression models.

Reference-contexts: The performance of Occam's Window was almost as good. For comparison with other standard variable selection techniques, three standard variable selection procedures were used to select a "best" model, Efroymson's stepwise method <ref> (Miller, 1990) </ref>, minimum Mallow's Cp and maximum adjusted R 2 . Efroymson's stepwise method is like forward selection except that when a new variable is added to the subset, partial correlations are considered to see is any of the variables currently in the subset should be dropped.

Reference-contexts: MC 3 for discrete graphical models is described in Madigan and York (1993). 3 Model uncertainty and prediction 3.1 Example: Crime and Punishment Up to the 1960s, criminal behavior was traditionally viewed as deviant and linked to the offender's presumed exceptional psychological, social or family circumstances <ref> (Taft and Eng-land, 1964) </ref>. Becker (1968) and Stigler (1970) argued, on the contrary, that the decision to engage in criminal activity is a rational choice determined by its costs and benefits relative to other (legitimate) opportunities.
