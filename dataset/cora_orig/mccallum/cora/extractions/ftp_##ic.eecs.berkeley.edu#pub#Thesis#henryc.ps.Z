Reference-contexts: In fact numerical methods based on finite-difference, finite-element, integral-equation or other techniques, generally used for computing exact electrical pa 49 rameters of arbitrary structures [89] [88] [5] [48], are computationally intensive. A better approach consists of creating models of interconnect, easily obtainable through CAD model generators <ref> [1] </ref> [41]. Sophisticated analytical models for parasitic capacitances accounting for higher order non-linearities have been created using an ad hoc model generation tool [20]. Similar models have been created with the inductance model generator Indmod [100].

Reference-contexts: This test suite frequently defaults to the complete set of circuit specifications. This approach is becoming increasingly expensive in both test development and test execution times. The specifications of mixed analog-digital circuits are usually very large (e.g. see <ref> [2] </ref>), which not only results in long manual test development, but also in prohibitive testing times on expensive (0.5M$-2M$) automated testing equipment with mixed-signal capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Its level of complexity is shown in Figure 5.1. 6.2 Design Specifications The - A/D converter that has been implemented is a second order system with a 1-bit quantizer similar to the one found in <ref> [3] </ref>. The basic architecture of the is shown in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.3 shows the components of the complete system, i.e. the - converter itself, the clock generator, the bias circuitry, etc. <p> Given values for each of these parameters along with f x from Table 6.1, the SNR for the - A/D can be computed using a behavioral model developed for this particular system and the behavioral simulator, Midas <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our emphasis is to explicitly develop the methodology. Then develop the tools to support it. And furthermore, we will consider the entire design flow, "proving" the methodology using industrial strength design examples. Early work in analog design synthesis focussed solely on sizing schematics. Examples are Aplstap <ref> [4] </ref>, Delight.Spice [83], and Ecstasy [95]. These systems combined nonlinear optimization algorithms with circuit simulation. Work which followed wrapped schematic sizing with an architectural selection phase, but because of the high CPU cost and the numerical instabilities associated with Spice, these newer systems avoided Spice simulation in the design loop.

Reference-contexts: Three-dimensional simulation of all the structures present in the layout is impractical for real circuits. In fact numerical methods based on finite-difference, finite-element, integral-equation or other techniques, generally used for computing exact electrical pa 49 rameters of arbitrary structures [89] [88] <ref> [5] </ref> [48], are computationally intensive. A better approach consists of creating models of interconnect, easily obtainable through CAD model generators [1] [41].

Reference-contexts: This system includes two major analog subsystems: a frequency synthesizing phase-locked loop (PLL) and three current source D/A converters. This system is intended to be equivalent to a RAMDAC <ref> [6] </ref> system except that we have chosen not to implement the static RAM lookup table. This greatly reduces the cost, and should not degrade the worth of this example as an experiment for the design methodology.

Reference-contexts: The configuration obtained from the solution of the CG is used as starting 48 point for the linear program.

Reference-contexts: The constraint violations are evaluated at every step of the annealing through efficient parasitic estimation and use of models for the resulting performance degradation. The optimization algorithm used in this tool is simulated annealing [49] and has been implemented in a tool called Puppy-A <ref> [13] </ref>. The objective is not only area and wiring minimization, but also the elimination of parasitic constraint violations. The cost function to be minimized by the annealing accounts for parasitic control, symmetries, matching, and well separation as well as chip area and total wire length.

Reference-contexts: M 1 will be placed symmetrically to M 2 and M 3 will be placed symmetrically to M 4 . The "MATCH" command asks that the transistors listed be placed close together. 3.

Reference-contexts: However, by the inherent nature of a module generator the flexibility of the design is strongly limited. To alleviate these problems, a module generator, Ldo, and a simulated annealing based placer, Puppy-A, have been combined to operate simultaneously <ref> [15] </ref>. That is, the search space of the annealing has been expanded to include all modules optimally computed by Ldo. The objective of the annealing is not only area and wiring minimization, but also the elimination of parasitic constraint violations and the enforcement of topological constraints.

Reference-contexts: Analytical models of the effect of technology gradients on various design parameters are used to calculate matching constraints on active devices, represented in terms of their relative positions and orientations <ref> [16] </ref>. Graph-based techniques are used to efficiently derive symmetry constraints from matching information. 4.2.1.2 Tools for Constraint-Driven Layout Synthesis The layout generation process has been partitioned into its traditional components obtained from the digital world, namely module generation, placement, routing, and 45 compaction.

Reference-contexts: The effect of these parasitics on performance is carefully modeled using sensitivity analysis and used to drive the algorithms toward a solution which minimizes violations to the original specifications. Art [18], is a gridless channel router based on the vertical-constraint graph (VCG) algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>. Channel routers can be efficiently used for detailed routing in the case where layout placement is generated to form a slicing structure, and where routing channels are isolated. The VCG is a graph whose nodes represent the horizontal wiring segments and whose edges represent constraint relations between the nodes.

Reference-contexts: The verification phase is performed after either placement or final routing and has been made particularly accurate by use of the analytical models for interconnect proposed in [20]. 46 4.2.1.2.2 Routing Two constraint-driven routing tools are available: Sastar/Art <ref> [18] </ref>, a global/channel router, and Road [69], a maze router. In general, channel routers are the preferred tools for the routing of large mixed-mode circuits. The most important advantage of the channel routing approach is the possibility of a global overview of the communication flows in the chip [53]. <p> The effect of these parasitics on performance is carefully modeled using sensitivity analysis and used to drive the algorithms toward a solution which minimizes violations to the original specifications.

Reference-contexts: The parameters considered in our approach are: substrate and cross-over capacitances, stray resistances and inductances in interconnect lines, threshold voltage, and transconductance in active devices. Constrained optimization has been used to calculate bounds on parasitics and/or mismatches, based on a sensitivity analysis of the circuit <ref> [19] </ref>. The objective of the optimization is to obtain constraints that can be easily met by every phase of the layout synthesis. The tool, Parcar, was developed to handle this.

Reference-contexts: Thus a more compact layout, less routing congestion, and a better matching between the modules is achieved. The verification phase is performed after either placement or final routing and has been made particularly accurate by use of the analytical models for interconnect proposed in <ref> [20] </ref>. 46 4.2.1.2.2 Routing Two constraint-driven routing tools are available: Sastar/Art [18], a global/channel router, and Road [69], a maze router. In general, channel routers are the preferred tools for the routing of large mixed-mode circuits. <p> A better approach consists of creating models of interconnect, easily obtainable through CAD model generators [1] [41]. Sophisticated analytical models for parasitic capacitances accounting for higher order non-linearities have been created using an ad hoc model generation tool <ref> [20] </ref>. Similar models have been created with the inductance model generator Indmod [100]. Based on these models, Estpar performs physical layout extraction of parasitics and active devices, allowing greater efficiency of the extraction process, at no great expense of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Two algorithms have been implemented in our analog-specific global router Sas-tar: one based on the simulated annealing algorithm [98] [93] [101] and the other based on the A* algorithm <ref> [21] </ref>. Both algorithms are based on a single cost function which takes into account stray resistances, substrate and cross-over capacitances related to the interconnect. <p> Special connector configurations are used to guarantee good parasitic matching between nets crossing each other over the symmetry axis. The same number of corners and vias and the same interconnect length are maintained for both wires. Road [69] is a maze router based on the A* algorithm <ref> [21] </ref>, on a relative grid with dynamic allocation. The A* algorithm is a heuristic improvement of the Lee-Moore algorithm [55]; in the wave propagation step only one element of the wave front is propagated at a time.

IEEE ICCAD, </booktitle> <pages> pp. 598-603, </pages> <month> November </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: The advantage is that the algorithm is efficient for A/D converters with low error rate and can handle highly correlated noise such as flicker noise. More recently, a time-domain, non-Monte Carlo method for computer simulation of electrical noise in nonlinear dynamic circuits with arbitrary excitations has been developed <ref> [22] </ref> for the extraction of parameters for PLL circuits. Available transistor-level noise 39 simulation tools (such as the noise simulation implemented in Spice) are not suitable for our purposes, because they cannot handle circuits with changing bias conditions, i.e., circuits in nonlinear operation.

Reference-contexts: The simulation time is significantly lower than an estimated Spice simulation time, and the simulation results agree with the measured chip data. Based on the models mentioned above, we have developed a behavioral simulator for phase/delay-locked systems <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> The numerical algorithms employed in this simulator have controllable numerical noise which makes it possible to predict phase noise accurately. A detailed description of this simulator can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. In addition to developing analog behavioral models, parameter extraction techniques have been investigated to identify the models from a circuit description or from measured data. For Nyquist rate A/D converters a novel noise extraction technique has been developed. <p> Finally, the output signal is the VCO output divided by k. The intermediate level parameters for the PLL are shown in Figure 7.2. Given a value for each of these parameter, a behavioral simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the PLL <ref> [23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Primitives such as current mirrors, differential pairs, common gate devices, diode connected devices, and diode connected chains are programmed into the system to aid in finding solutions for the geometric constraints. Recent proposals to address the problem of complexity have called for the inclusion of high-level description languages <ref> [24] </ref>. An example description for a sensor interface is given. Examples of abstracted components are: "amplification," "filtering," and "single-ended to differential conversion." None of these systems address a precise use of hierarchy. Behavioral simulators are not provided, and constraint propagation is not clearly defined.

Reference-contexts: The DNL is graphed in Figure 2.9. The computation for INL is more complicated. It is graphed for all codes in the figure on the left. The maximum value is given by <ref> [25] </ref>: INL max = 2 2 1 e (2.11) Typical requirements for INL and DNL range between 0.5 and 2.0 LSB. <p> Another advantage is that a thermometer decoder is not required. The input bits directly control the switches. For example, code 011, activates the 1x and 2x current source to produce a 3x output. The INL for the binary and linear array architectures is the same <ref> [25] </ref>. The DNL, however, is much worse. The maximum DNL is DNL max = 2 n 1 e (2.12) A reduction in layout area is traded for increased DNL. Often this DNL penalty is too large. A compromise is to combine these two architectures. <p> These design constants are shown in Table 6.6. A set of design constraints are specified for the integrator. These are derived from the high level synthesis results (Tables 6.3 and 6.5). Because analytic methods <ref> [25] </ref> for determining these constraints differed from Midas results, we chose to tighten some of the constraints. This is an example of why we do not propose a fully automatic synthesis process. By allowing us to intervene, we incorporated the value-added of the designer.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge based methods were developed. Complexity-wise, research was primarily focussed on operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA). IDAC <ref> [26] </ref> synthesized circuits by sizing each schematic in its architectural library using dedicated built-in analyzers for simulation. These analyzers consisted of simple equations representing circuit performances. OASYS [42] added hierarchy, macromodels, and an expert system for schematic selection and sizing.

Reference-contexts: It used slicing structures for placement, an area router, and incorporated active constraints in the compaction step. The next generation of work focussed on complete design systems combining the design and physical synthesis phases. They also aimed for higher circuit complexity. The IDAC/ILAC system <ref> [27] </ref> included hierarchy to address the complexity issue. However, they had no high level simulator to aid in mapping. A sigma-delta A/D converter was synthesized claiming that it requires a "trivial" mapping.

Reference-contexts: A parameterized schematic of known architectures implementation is a better approach, because it can generate highly-effective circuits based on known architectures for complex analog functions in a flexible environment by optimizing the device sizes with respect to various performance measures [50] <ref> [28] </ref> [46].

Reference-contexts: Module generators can be implemented using an expert system approach or a parameterized schematic of known architectures approach. Expert system implementation for simple analog blocks such as operational amplifiers and comparators have been reported in earlier years <ref> [29] </ref>. Unfortunately, switched-capacitors and A/D converters are much more complex. No clear way exists to set the rules for their implementation.

Reference-contexts: Then the specifications and priorities of each sub-block are fed into the local optimizer to generate the device sizes. This local optimizer can be a low-level synthesis block such as Opasyn or Lager <ref> [30] </ref> (to generate digital circuitry), or library cells can be used. When all of the sub-blocks have been optimized locally, a behavioral simulator is used to obtain the A/D performance.

Reference-contexts: D is the distance between the two transistors. Thus, increasing the transistor size and placing them close together can reduce mismatch. This is an effective way for reducing mismatch. Refinements to Equations 2.5 and 2.6 based on our experimental results (Chapter 5) have been made <ref> [33] </ref>. However, the fact that mismatch is reduced by using larger transistors and by placing them close together still remains true. These mismatches result in non-ideal performances. "Non-working" parts are primarily due to these second order effects.

Reference-contexts: This information pinpointed the parameters which caused each of the failed chips to exceed the specifications. Using the behavioral model, automatic test patterns were generated for the D/A <ref> [34] </ref>. These results showed that the D/A's could be characterized in under 40 tests. 84 5.7 Design Times One measure of the success or failure of this methodology is the amount of actual design time required for the design and physical synthesis phases.

Reference-contexts: Leaf cells are generated by using one of two procedural languages. Block level layout is generated using placement (slicing structures), routing (global and channel), and compaction steps. ICEWATER [45], STAIC's counterpart, also uses a procedural language for layout generation. ANAGRAM <ref> [36] </ref>, OASYS's counterpart, strived for the generic layout of leaf cells. Rather than using a procedural language, simulated annealing was used for placement and an area router was used. OPASYN had a built in layout generator. Like OASYS, OPASYN focussed on leaf cell layout.

Reference-contexts: A sample output from the behavioral simulator is shown in Figure 5.4 for a 10-bit D/A converter. INL max is approximately 1.5 lsb and DNL max is approximately 0.3 lsb for this particular design. Recall that behavioral simulation is implementation independent <ref> [37] </ref>. These simulations are valid for any current source circuit that can be characterized by the parameters in Table 5.2. A nonlinear optimizer [78] is the other tool that is invoked. This tool requires the performance and optimization information found in Table 5.1.

Reference-contexts: A nonlinear unconstrained steepest descent approach was used for schematic sizing.

Reference-contexts: A parameterized schematic of known architectures implementation is a better approach, because it can generate highly-effective circuits based on known architectures for complex analog functions in a flexible environment by optimizing the device sizes with respect to various performance measures [50] [28] <ref> [46] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the input files for circuit synthesis, layout synthesis requires: (1) a structured A/D converter netlist and (2) device structure information from the circuit synthesis phase. A mixed top-down/bottom-up approach <ref> [47] </ref> is used. This method consists of: netlist rearrangement, circuit partitioning, floorplan optimization, leaf-cells generation, sub-block place and route, and global place and route. In all steps, emphasis is placed on the fine details of layout which influence analog circuit performance.

Reference-contexts: In general, channel routers are the preferred tools for the routing of large mixed-mode circuits. The most important advantage of the channel routing approach is the possibility of a global overview of the communication flows in the chip <ref> [53] </ref>. Due to the increasingly greater relevance that routing area is assuming in today's VLSI circuits, global routing is a crucial phase in every framework for layout design. Channel routers however, define only the physical details of interconnect within the layout areas allocated for its implementation, the channels.

Reference-contexts: According to the proposed strategies, a behavioral model for the class of Nyquist rate A/D converters <ref> [62] </ref> has been developed. The behavioral representation captures all the relevant A/D behavior without information concerning the actual implementation. The behavior of an A/D is affected by two basic statistical effects: noise and process variations. <p> However, this approach is problematic because it does not represent noise effects. Furthermore, evaluating the transfer function is time consuming because it usually depends on a large number of circuit elements each with process variations. In this approach, all the statistical variations are captured in the model <ref> [62] </ref>. The variations are classified into noise and process variations according to how these non-idealities affect the A/D behavior. To describe noise effects a joint probability density function is used.

Reference-contexts: Spice enhanced with a statistical package receives as inputs a set of W 's and L's corresponding to the main and cascode MOS devices along with architectural, operational, and technological information from Table 5.1, and returns i and R. A cut 74 ting plane algorithm <ref> [65] </ref> is used for the optimization. 1 The optimization problem is shown below: minimize area (W main ; L main ; W cascode ; L cascode ) s.t. i (W main ; L main ; W cascode ; L cascode ) fl i R (W main ; L main ; W <p> This is a region where the timing jitter is undefined. Since Minos does not restrict itself to the feasible region while searching for the solution, it may wander into a region where one of its constraint functions is undefined; this results in a failure. The Supporting Hyperplane Algorithm <ref> [65] </ref> was used to solve the optimization problem. In this approach, the search remains in the feasible region. Great care, however, had to be taken when computing the planes.

Reference-contexts: The constraint violations are evaluated at every step of the annealing through efficient parasitic estimation and use of models for the resulting performance degradation. Multiple symmetry axes can be managed with the algorithm of Virtual Symmetry Axes <ref> [68] </ref>, that dynamically defines axis positions. Thus a more compact layout, less routing congestion, and a better matching between the modules is achieved.

Reference-contexts: The verification phase is performed after either placement or final routing and has been made particularly accurate by use of the analytical models for interconnect proposed in [20]. 46 4.2.1.2.2 Routing Two constraint-driven routing tools are available: Sastar/Art [18], a global/channel router, and Road <ref> [69] </ref>, a maze router. In general, channel routers are the preferred tools for the routing of large mixed-mode circuits. The most important advantage of the channel routing approach is the possibility of a global overview of the communication flows in the chip [53]. <p> Special connector configurations are used to guarantee good parasitic matching between nets crossing each other over the symmetry axis. The same number of corners and vias and the same interconnect length are maintained for both wires. Road <ref> [69] </ref> is a maze router based on the A* algorithm [21], on a relative grid with dynamic allocation. The A* algorithm is a heuristic improvement of the Lee-Moore algorithm [55]; in the wave propagation step only one element of the wave front is propagated at a time. <p> Depending on the floorplan and netlist, well and substrate contacts are created during placement. Fully differential architectures and symmetry in layout are maintained. Sub-block routing is done with Road <ref> [69] </ref>. 56 4.3.2 Example Sample inputs and outputs for Adore are presented in this section. Given a Spice-like netlist for a switched capacitor filter circuit and a file containing technology information, the leaf cells are generated and placed. Routing is left as a post processing step.

Reference-contexts: Principal components of nonideal behavior- kT/C noise, finite OTA gain, and capacitor mismatch, are missing as performance constraints for their integrator. The layout system uses a simultaneous place and route approach. Simulated annealing and an area router are again used, but constraints on parasitics can be selected. Recently, WRIGHT <ref> [77] </ref> has been introduced to limit substrate coupling effects on critical circuits. One other design system is the ISAID/RACHANA system [66][67][38]. This system is knowledge-based, but adds "qualitative reasoning" to provide a systematic approach to storing and using the knowledge in the system.

Reference-contexts: The result and status are returned. 59 Currently, two optimizers are supported by the interface. Minos <ref> [78] </ref> is the first. It uses a variety of techniques to solve nonlinear programming problems. For example, if the constraints are linear, but the objective function is nonlinear, it uses a reduced-gradient algorithm with a quasi-Newton algorithm. <p> INL max is approximately 1.5 lsb and DNL max is approximately 0.3 lsb for this particular design. Recall that behavioral simulation is implementation independent [37]. These simulations are valid for any current source circuit that can be characterized by the parameters in Table 5.2. A nonlinear optimizer <ref> [78] </ref> is the other tool that is invoked. This tool requires the performance and optimization information found in Table 5.1. The performances are used as constraints for the optimization problem.

The principal difficulties were (1) when computing SNR, Midas has a large standard error, *, and (2) SNR is extremely nonlinear with respect to its input variables.

A sample element is circled in the upper right hand corner. There are eight unit elements in each row with four rows in the array.

As illustrated in the upper left hand corner, 76 the unit elements are broken down into three parts. The top part consists of local decode logic. This allows a tremendous savings in routing area by performing part of the decode logic locally. <p> The active areas are 2.86mm 2 and 3.81mm 2 , respectively.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, even when drawn identically, i.e. same gate width and length, same diffusion areas, etc., and placed within close proximity, transistors do not behave identically. There are many reasons for this; e.g. gate oxide thickness variations, lithographic variations, substrate doping variations, surface gradients, and temperature gradients <ref> [86] </ref>. This limits the number of bits that can be achieved for this type of D/A converter. Fortunately, in design, variations between transistors can be controlled using device sizing and placement techniques. Ultimately, however, typical maximum resolutions lie between 10 and 12 bits for current technologies. <p> However, this technique is limited by the supply voltage and does not address the k term.

Reference-contexts: To this extent, we have developed behavioral representations for voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) and detectors that are essential circuit components in any phase/delay-locked system [61]. Phase/delay-locked loops have many applications; they are used in receivers, clock generators [104], clock recovery [56], data synchronization [99], etc. In contrast to traditional macromodels <ref> [96] </ref>, the second-order effects, distortion and phase jitter, are captured by our behavioral models. Our representations are general and independent of the circuit architectures. Moreover, we have developed parameter extraction techniques, which are described in detail in [61], to identify the models from a circuit description or from measured data.

The FilSyn <ref> [97] </ref> program automates the design of a switched capacitor filters. It mimics the decision making process of a filter designer. For layout, Adore uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate the capacitor arrays required, and then uses standard operational amplifier and switches to complete the layout.

Both algorithms are based on a single cost function which takes into account stray resistances, substrate and cross-over capacitances related to the interconnect.
