Abstract: Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is an intuitive method to program a robot. The user, acting as a teacher or programmer, shows how a particular task can be performed. The demonstration is monitored using an interface device that allows the measurement and recording of both the applied commands as well as the data simultaneously perceived by robot's sensors. This paper considers the problems of not-at-all optimal examples that in general result from a human demonstration. It identifies the sources of non-optimality and presents methods to cope with it.
