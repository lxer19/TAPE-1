Abstract: To facilitate the sharing of information using modern communication networks, users must be able to decide on a privacy policywhat information to conceal, what to reveal, and to whom. We describe the evolution of privacy interfacesthe user interfaces for specifying privacy poli-ciesin COLLABCLIO, a system for sharing web browsing histories. Our experience has shown us that privacy policies ought to be treated as first-class objects: policy objects should have an intensional representation, and privacy interfaces should support direct manipulation of these objects. We also show how these conclusions apply to a variety of domains such as file systems, email, and telephony.

Reference-contexts: Another area of related work concerns the issue of privacy in conjunction with collaborative systems involving live video feeds. Bellotti <ref> [1] </ref> proposes a framework to guide the incorporation of privacy into the design of collaborative systems, as well as a set of criteria for evaluating such systems; the evaluation section discusses our experience with COLLABCLIO in light of several of her criteria. <p> Based on our preliminary results, all users preferred the rule-based interface to the example-based interface. We now analyze COLLABCLIO in terms of Bellottis <ref> [1] </ref> criteria for evaluating ubiquitous computing services. Flexibility: what counts as private varies according to context and interpersonal relationships. Thus mechanisms of control over user and system behaviors may need to be tailorable to some extent by the individuals concerned. We designed flexibility into the system from the start.

Most approaches to this problem have centered around shared bookmark lists (for example <ref> [2, 6, 7] </ref>). However, such approaches require a user to anticipate which URLs may be of interest to others, and to manually enter such URLs into the system.

Reference-contexts: The privacy interface should make it easy to create, inspect, modify, and monitor such objects. To clarify this objective, we introduce the distinction between intensional and extensional representations of privacy policies <ref> [5] </ref>. An extensional representation describes a set by enumerating the items in it (such as a list of all private web pages). The record light interface creates an extensional privacy policy. In contrast, an intensional representation describes a set by characterizing the objects in the set.

Reference-contexts: We have analyzed the privacy interfaces in each of these domains, and show how they fail to treat privacy policies as first-class objects. RELATED WORK Several systems have already addressed the problem of sharing URLs. Warmlist <ref> [8] </ref> is similar to COLLABCLIO in that it automatically indexes the content of web pages stored in a users bookmark list. However, the only facility for sharing URLs with other users is by indirectly importing other users Warmlists. Several other systems allow users to share URLs with one another directly.

Reference-contexts: Direct manipulation of privacy policies Our claim that privacy policies should be treated as first-class objects leads naturally to the conjecture that a privacy interface should support direct manipulation of privacy policies. This term, first coined by Shneiderman <ref> [9] </ref>, refers to user interfaces with the following three properties: 1. Continuous representation of the object of interest. 2. Physical actions or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax. 3. Rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible.
