Note: Manufacturing-Operation  Although AI planning techniques can potentially be  it is important to address these issues in a realistic and robust manner. Furthermore, by investigating these issues, AI researchers may be able to discover principles that are relevant for AI planning in general.  
Abstract: Technical report CS-TR-3397, UMIACS-TR-95-3, ISR-TR-95-4 To appear, AAAI Spring Symposium on Integrated Planning Applications, March 1995 Abstract As an example, in this paper we describe the techniques for manufacturing-operation planning used in IMACS (Interactive Manufacturability Analysis and Critiquing System). We compare and contrast them with the techniques used in classical AI planning systems, and point out that some of the techniques used in IMACS may also be useful in other kinds of planning problems.

For example, there are 22 primary features for the socket P 0 , as shown in Figure 5. Since the features in F can overlap, not all of them will always be needed in order create P from S.

F is the set of all primary features for P and S. IMACS generates F automatically from the solid models of P and S, using an algorithm described in <ref> [31, 12] </ref>. For example, there are 22 primary features for the socket P 0 , as shown in Figure 5. Since the features in F can overlap, not all of them will always be needed in order create P from S.
