Abstract: To keep avatars and other moving objects on the ground in virtual environments, it is ne c-essary to find the points where these objects should contact the terrain. This is often done using collision detection; however, this is inefficient, because general collision detection solves a problem that is inherently more complex than merely determining terrain contact points. B e-cause the Quick Oriented Terrain Algorithm (QOTA) focuses solely on the problem of inte r-secting lines of a predetermined orientation with a terrain model, it provides very rapid support for terrain following. For example, given a 13,000 polygon terrain, QOTA running on a 250MHz R4400 MIPS processor can calculate an intersection point in less than 19 microse c-onds (1.9 x 10 -5 seconds). Given a preferred orientation, such as the direction of the gravity vector, for the lines to be intersected with a terrain, QOTA uses a preprocessing step that sorts the terrain polygons into a quadtree and adds bounding boxes and polygon edge equation parameters to speed up pol y-gon containment checking. In the example above, this preprocessing takes approximately 2 seconds. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.
