Reference-contexts: The security policies are enforced by security mechanisms. Compromising the security mechanisms is intrusion whereas violating the security policies without compromising the security mechanisms by legitimate users is insider abuse. Misuse includes both intrusion and insider abuse. Misuse can been handled by signature based and anomaly based approaches <ref> [CFMS95] </ref>. In signature based detection, audit logs are matched against a database of known attack patterns. In anomaly based detection, it is assumed that the set of intrusive and misuse events equals the set of anomalous events and such anomalies can be detected in the audit records.

Reference-contexts: Clustering techniques ([Eve73]) can be used to discover these clusters where the similarity function can be based on the aggregated features. Deviation from the profiles is detected if new audit records fail to be classified into one of the discovered clusters. Other techniques used in knowledge discovery systems ([DF95], <ref> [FPSSU96] </ref>, [PSF91]) can be borrowed to discover the usage patterns from the set of aggregated and primitive features. FRAMEWORK The interactions between different modules in our system are depicted as follows: 1.
