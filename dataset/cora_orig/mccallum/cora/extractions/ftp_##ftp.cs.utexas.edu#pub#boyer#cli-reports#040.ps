Reference-contexts: A step from unit interconnection to syntactic interconnection was made by Tichy [Tichy 86] in a tool that determines when changes to a program entity necessitate recompilation of various parts of a system. More than any of the aforementioned systems, the Boyer/Moore theorem prover <ref> [Boyer & Moore 88] </ref> solves a problem akin to that faced in the GVE: proof dependencies that penetrate arbitrarily deeply through the program structure. The prover enforces a rigid incremental development policy for function definitions.
