Abstract: In a new collaborative project involving the University of California, Berkeley, NASA Ames Research Center, and Honeywell Systems Research Center, we have begun the study of hierarchical, hybrid control systems in the framework of air traffic management systems (ATMS). The need for a new ATMS arises from the overcrowding of large urban airports and the need to more efficiently land and take off larger numbers of aircraft, without building new runways. Technological advances that make a more advanced air traffic control system a reality include the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time computers (both on board the aircraft and in the control tower) and global positioning systems. The usefulness of these technological advances is currently limited by today's air traffic control system, which involves the use of "freeways" in the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) region around urban airports. These freeways are set approach patterns to runways which do not allow for the possibility of so-called "free flight" by an aircraft to its destination. Limiting the aircraft trajectories in this manner results in the addition of both planned and unplanned delays to air travel.

Reference-contexts: In order to improve the efficiency of the current ATC system, NASA Ames is developing a system which automates some parts of ATC. The system is called the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), and is described in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], and [3]. CTAS is a program which generates advisories, or suggested trajectories, runway assignments, landing sequences, and schedules, which the controller may use in managing air traffic.

Reference-contexts: The functionality of CTAS is purely advisory: the controller still communicates verbally to the pilot of each aircraft, and may decide to use or ignore the information that CTAS provides. Field tests of CTAS are now underway at the Denver and Dallas/Fort Worth airports <ref> [4] </ref>. 3. Conflict & Coordination 3.1 The origins of conflict In a multiagent setting there is always the possibility of conflict between the objectives of the agents.

Reference-contexts: Clearly this approach will predict a lot more conflicts than the constant velocity extrapolation. If we assume that the aircraft in question is allowed to move away from its neighbors, conflict prediction becomes a pursuit-evasion dynamical game <ref> [6] </ref>, with the neighbors pursuing (doing their best to cause conflict) and our aircraft evading (doing its best to avoid it). Whenever a conflict is predicted the strategic plan ner is notified to resolve it. As discussed in Section 3 resolution is done by communication.

Reference-contexts: The kinematic model and the planning techniques used by the tactical level can play a crucial role in the closed loop system performance as well as the verification process.

One very interesting aspect of solution of [7] is that it includes helices, circles and straight line segments. This is especially pleasing, since such solutions are frequently used by the current ATC.
