Title: Clustering and Volume Scattering for Hierarchical Radiosity Calculations general hierarchical transfer algorithm for volumes is
Author: Francois Sillion 
Note: A  
Affiliation: CNRS iMAGIS IMAG  
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to hierarchical radiosity computation, making it practical for the simulation of energy exchanges in very complex environments. Results indicate that the new formulation allows the effective simulation of environments of significant complexity, containing several thousands of surfaces or volumes. In this new technique a hierarchy is constructed in a bottom-up fashion, in effect grouping together nearby surfaces for the purpose of evaluating their energy exchanges with distant objects. This clustering approach eliminates the need for an O(n 2 ) initial linking stage, by establishing connections between abstract entities that behave like volumes.

Reference-contexts: Since these entities contain several surfaces of arbitrary orientation, they can be represented as volumetric objects. Previous efforts to simplify the radiosity algorithm have either attempted to treat subsets of the scene independently in a divide-and-conquer approach <ref> [17, 1] </ref>, or manually constructed groups of patches used as representatives for their contents [12, 8]. In this paper we propose a new hierarchical algorithm that borrows ideas from volume scattering methods to express the hierarchical exchanges between clusters, and completely automates the creation of clusters.

Reference-contexts: One possibility, similar to the idea of "virtual walls" to accelerate radiosity calculations <ref> [17, 3] </ref>, is to attach surfaces only to leaves of the hierarchical volume description.

This is a major advantage compared to the quadratic matrix of form factors needed to completely represent the possible energy transfers with "conventional" radiosity. However, all hierarchical radiosity methods to date proceed in a top-down fashion, by selectively subdividing a set of input surfaces. <p> The procedure for volumes is almost identical to its surface-based counterpart. It first computes a bound on the error incurred by a link at the current level. This can be done either by bounding the error on the form factor alone <ref> [4] </ref>, or by bounding the radiosity transfer (BF refinement) 4 [5].

Reference-contexts: This can be seen as a combination of the zonal method [13] and the hierarchical radiosity algorithm 2 <ref> [5] </ref>. Specific issues raised by the combination of both methods are highlighted. 2 Since the first version of this paper was written, it was brought to our attention that a similar approach is described in [2] for a homogeneous medium. <p> Octrees, BSP trees, or hierarchies of bounding volumes could be used as well, and our presentation is done with a generic data structure. The original hierarchical radiosity algorithm is also assumed to be well known to the reader <ref> [5] </ref>. Refinement of the links The core of the hierarchical radiosity algorithm is a recursive refinement procedure: considering two volumes, it decides whether the transfer of energy is correctly represented at the current level, otherwise it subdivides one of the volumes. <p> It first computes a bound on the error incurred by a link at the current level. This can be done either by bounding the error on the form factor alone [4], or by bounding the radiosity transfer (BF refinement) 4 <ref> [5] </ref>. Based on the error estimates for the energy transfers in both directions, a decision is made to either subdivide one of the volumes (which one depends on the relative magnitude of both estimates) or establish a link between the volumes.

Perhaps the main reason for this is that when surfaces are not infinitely small, the visibility (transmittance) function becomes more of a binary quantity.

Reference-contexts: These are the notion of self-link, and the modified Push-Pull procedure using irradiance. 3.1 Creating a volume model We first consider the case of a large number of "small" objects. This model could be used to represent a number of natural situations such as foliage, as noted by Patmore <ref> [10] </ref>. The value of this model is that, as objects become smaller, the behaviour of the medium resembles more and more that of a density distribution. In this section we therefore model the radiative properties of surface clusters using equivalent isotropic scattering volumes.

As noted above, an isotropic scattering volume element has an equivalent area of A = 4V .
