Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 74 Results Abstract We have extended D. H. D. Warren's abstract machine for sequential Prolog with parallel instructions that implement bounded quantifications, an extension to Prolog proposed by Barklund and Bevemyr. These instructions are intended for parallel computers supporting the data parallel programming model. Luther, an emulator for the sequential abstract machine implemented in the C programming language, has been extended with these instructions, implemented in the data parallel C* programming language. We have coded three example programs that use bounded quantifications, and run them in the emulator on a Connection Machine model 200, a SIMD parallel computer. We compare the run times on this parallel computer with the run times obtained with a sequential implementation of bounded quantifications on a SUN-4M sequential computer. The best result is that one parallel bounded quantification program runs 30 times faster on the Connection Machine than an ordinary recursive program implementing the same algorithm running on the sequential computer. It is conceivable that one can obtain far higher speed-ups when running on larger data parallel computers using bounded quantifications.

Reference-contexts: We also consider running bounded quantifications on a shared-memory multiprocessor (SUN 630MP) and expect nearly linear speed-ups. It would be interesting to add bounded quantifications also to other sequential logic programming languages, e.g., Godel <ref> (Hill & Lloyd, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, his idea for parallel execution is similar to ours. There is a particular array mode, corresponding to certain bounded quantifications, which allows array programs to use the data parallelism of the SIMD-type DAP computer <ref> (Reddaway, 1979) </ref>. The array mode of over the recursive program for larger `batches'. This may be due to cache effects.
