Title: Developing Plans for Robotic Excavators  
Author: Sanjiv Singh 
Note: 1 Sanjiv Singh  
Abstract: We would like a robot excavator that is able to excavate a volume of soil according to specification. To this end we have developed a general method that can be used to provide prescriptions as to where and how to dig for a variety of excavator configurations and tasks. This paper presents simulation results of a front-end loader performing a loading task. In addition, preliminary results from a trenching experiments conducted with a robot in our lab are presented.
