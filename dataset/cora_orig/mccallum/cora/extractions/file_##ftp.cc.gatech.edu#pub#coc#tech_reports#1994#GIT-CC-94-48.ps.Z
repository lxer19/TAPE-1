Abstract: We consider packet-switched lightwave WDM networks with stations equipped with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers. Access to each of the available channels is controlled by a weighted TDM scheme, whereby the channels are not necessarily shared equally among the various sources. While previous work focused on the throughput characteristics of such schemes, in this paper we study the problem of designing TDM frames to minimize the mean packet delay, as well as the mean packet loss probability given a finite buffer capacity. The corresponding optimization problems are shown to be hard allocation problems, and heuristics to obtain near-optimal solutions are developed. For (potentially non-uniform) communication patterns common to parallel and distributed computations, our approach represents a significant improvement over I-TDMA*. In addition, the margin of improvement increases with the size of the network.

Reference-contexts: As a result, it has been shown [18, 19] that these schedules may significantly improve the overall network performance in terms of both throughput and response collection cost <ref> [1] </ref>. Techniques to construct such schedules were developed in [18, 19]. Since these techniques may directly be applied to this work, in this paper we will focus on schedules which provide full connectivity in the strong sense.

Having C separate queues eliminates the head of line effects of a single buffer, and helps to drastically improve the throughput and delay characteristics as demonstrated in <ref> [2] </ref> for I-TDMA* 4 . We also assume that the buffer for channel c at station i has a capacity of L ic packets; packets arriving to find a full buffer are lost. 2.2 Transmission Schedules Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a well-known media access scheme. <p> We also assume that the buffer for channel c at station i has a capacity of L ic packets; packets arriving to find a full buffer are lost. 2.2 Transmission Schedules Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a well-known media access scheme.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wave division multiplexing (WDM) is currently believed to be the most promising technology for implementing a new generation of computer communication networks that fully exploit the vast information-carrying capacity of single-mode fiber <ref> [10] </ref>. By carving the bandwidth of the optical medium into multiple concurrent channels, each on a different wavelength, WDM has the potential of delivering an aggregate throughput that can be in the order Terabits per second.

Reference-contexts: A similar problem was addressed in <ref> [13] </ref> for a single-channel network, and it was shown that the optimization yields a very hard allocation problem. <p> The issue of constructing these sets to achieve load balancing is addressed in Appendix A. Recall that the buffers for each source-channel pair are independent; therefore, if we consider each channel in isolation, all the results obtained in <ref> [13] </ref> will be applicable. We now review these results, which provide a lower bound on the multi-channel problem, given a partition of f1; : : : ; N g into sets R c . <p> The order in which the three subprob-lems are presented is irrelevant as the subproblems are interdependent, and an exact solution method would simultaneously resolve all of them. 9 * The percentage of time station i is permitted to transmit on channel c is <ref> [13, Eq. (3.3)] </ref> x ic = q ic + (1 k=1 p P N p 8 i (19) * For each source, i, the a ic (M ) permissions for i to transmit on channel c are equally spaced within the frame, i.e., 8 i : d ic = d ic <p> Even if they are, scheduling the transmissions between all sources and channels in equally spaced slots may violate constraints (5) and (6). To overcome this problem, a golden-ratio policy was developed in <ref> [13] </ref>, which requires that the frame length be a Fibonacci number. It was also shown that this policy places the various permissions within the frame in intervals close to the ones dictated by (20), and, as a result, it achieves an average packet delay very close to the lower bound. <p> Select the smallest Fibonacci number, M , that satisfies (18), and obtain a ic (M ) from (21) so that (7) and (8) hold. 3. Let c = 1, and use the golden ratio policy <ref> [13] </ref> to place the a ic (M ); i = 1; : : : ; N , slots in a frame for transmissions on channel c . Repeat for c = 2; : : : ; C to obtain an initial schedule, S 0 (M ). 4.

Reference-contexts: The network operates in a slotted mode, with a slot time equal to the packet transmission time plus the maximum tuning delay; the maximum is taken over all transmitters and all wavelength pairs. All stations are synchronized to the slot boundaries <ref> [21] </ref>. A collision will occur if two or more transmitters access the same channel in a given slot. All packets involved in a collision are considered lost, and recovery is assumed to take place via a higher level protocol.
