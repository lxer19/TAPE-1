Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the use of computer graphics techniques to model and explain the structures commonly observed in color histograms of images. This includes an accurate simulation of the physical reflection and transport behavior of light energy within 3D environments, the precise modeling of an image capturing system, and an interactive visualization module to display color histograms. Based on the fundamental rendering equation that describes light reflection and transport in the 3D world, we classify the color histogram structures of color images, and relate them to various physical components in image formation, including scene illumination, material reflectance properties, and the surface geometry of objects. We further show how these histogram structures can be effected by the artifacts caused by the limitation of image capturing systems. Our results demonstrate that the use of accurate simulation procedures under a precisely controlled computer graphic environment can clearly illustrate the causes of the structures observed, and can provide unique insights and explanations of image formation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Color histograms have been widely used in many image processing and computer vision systems. The structures observed in color histograms contain shading and shadow information of the 3D scene, and are used as important cues of physical processes for image analysis and object recognition <ref> [9, 8, 2, 12] </ref>. Previous research is mainly based on a dichromatic reflection model [13], consisting of two components, surface reflection (e.g. specular reflection) and body reflection (e.g. diffuse reflection) [13, 9, 8]. <p> The dichromatic model has been demonstrated to be successful in some computer vision systems to recognize and separate these two reflection components for image segmentation purpose <ref> [8, 2, 12] </ref>. However, commonly used approaches do not directly account for the indirect illumination from other surfaces, and hence can not describe the color histogram structures evident in scenes with indirect lighting. Bajcsy and Lee [3] extended this model by considering the first order of inter-reflection among surfaces. <p> These clusters are caused by the superposition of the two components of the reflection from objects' surfaces, and have been observed in previous research <ref> [9, 2] </ref>. Furthermore, we have also produced more complex new features such as off-plane thickening and banana shaped structures in the color histogram by incorporating the global illumination model in our image synthesis. Future work needs to consider more complex BRDF's.
