Abstract: I advocate a new model for distributed systems supporting mobility. In this architecture, an intermediary is interposed between client and server, which either acts alone or in cooperation with applications on a mobile host. Its purpose is to filter all but the most essential data that would travel over the slow or unreliable link to the mobile host. The goals of this work include: the creation of a general framework to ease the installation and management of filtering mechanisms, the design and implementation of sample filters to be used with both pre-existing and newly created applications, and an evaluation of the viability and performance of such an approach.

Reference-contexts: built upon a number of pre-existing mechanisms; these, and the reasons I chose them, include: * UNIX The UNIX platform was chosen for its ubiquity in the research world, my familiarity with the model, and the fact that we have access to the source code. 7 * Mach 3.0 Mach <ref> [1] </ref> 3 was chosen in part because I am familiar with it, due in part because of source access, and in part because it has unique features that are helpful.
