Abstract: Software agents, semi-intelligent autonomous tools, will play an increasing role in electronic commerce applications. In this paper we give an overview of the work conducted at MITs Media Laboratory on different types of agents for electronic commerce: from consumer to consumer smart classified ads systems, to merchant agents that provide integrative negotiation capabilities; from agents that facilitate expertise brokering to distributed reputation facilities. Furthermore, we discuss a full-day ecommerce experiment with 170 participants and present our results along with lessons learned.

Reference-contexts: Some of the first sites allowed users to perform Background and Motivation Moukas/Guttman/Maes - ICEC98 Submission 3 keyword searches on the ads <ref> [1] </ref>, some had their ads nicely categorized, making it easier to find ones of interest [2], while other sites had more advanced searching capabilities. For example, Stanford's Infomaster [3] allowed consumers to fill out a form that precisely describes the kind of apartment they are looking for.

Reference-contexts: This was one of the first lessons learned in the electronic commerce arena: merchants dont want to be compared just in product price terms. A while later, a new type of consumer agents, like Jango <ref> [5] </ref> and [23] hit the market which managed to solve the merchant blocking issue by having the product requests originate from each consumers web browser instead of from a central site as in BargainFinder. This way, requests to merchants from a Jango-augmented web browser appeared as requests from real consumers.

Reference-contexts: Our first system, Kasbah, is an electronic marketplace where agents buy and sell to one another on behalf of consumers <ref> [9] </ref>. Kasbah is a consumer to consumer electronic commerce system and is based on continuous double auction mechanisms. In a Kasbah environment we think of a selling agent as being analogous to a classified ad.

Reference-contexts: The next section describes this effort and discusses a few lessons learned. 3.1 Kasbah Agent Marketplace Experiment On October 30th 1996, the Media Laboratory organized a symposium on Digital Life for 171 attendees from industry <ref> [10] </ref>. Many of these people were not technically inclined and none had been introduced to the Kasbah concept beforehand. The attendees were given a total of three objects as well as some money (50 bits, as we called our unit of currency).

Reference-contexts: Exactly how to achieve this goal is left to the agent.The appropriate metaphor here is that of a personal assistant <ref> [11] </ref>. You tell your personal assistant what you would like to be done (sell this for the best possible price''), and trust it to figure out how to accomplish this task, freeing your time and energy for more interesting pursuits.

Reference-contexts: The aim of the PDA@shop project is to build a domain-independent system, which uses minimum domainspecific knowledge. The system uses a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) - in our system we are using US Robotics Pilot Pro <ref> [12] </ref> - as an interface communicating with a Kasbah Server for the back-end computational work in order to facilitate search for product types, their names and prices, as well as company names and related reputation quotes.
