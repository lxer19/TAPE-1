Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: Searching for relevant material in documents containing transcription errors presents new challenges for Information Retrieval. This paper examines information retrieval effectiveness on a corpus of spoken broadcast news documents. For documents transcribed using speech recognition, a substantial number of retrieval errors are due to query terms that occur in the spoken document, but are not transcribed because they are not within the speech recognition systems lexicon, even if that lexicon contains twenty thousand words. It has been shown that a phonetic lattice search in conjunction with full word search regains some of the information lost due to out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper an efficient alternative to this search is proposed that does not require a complete search of the phoneme lattices for all documents at runtime. By using fixed length strings of phonemes instead of phonetic lattices, an information retrieval system can search the phoneme space of a spoken document just as efficiently as a normal word document collection. Experimental evidence is presented that this technique permits the system to recapture some of the information lost due to out-of-vocabulary words in the speech recognition transcripts.

Reference-contexts: The Informedia digital video library project is developing a large digital library of video and audio material. Through the integration of technologies from the fields of natural language understanding, image processing, speech recognition, information retrieval and video compression, the Informedia digital video library system <ref> [Wactlar96, Informedia95, Christel94] </ref> allows a user to explore multimedia data in depth as well as in breadth. An overview of the system is shown in Figure 1. The process automatically segments hours of video programming into small coherent pieces and indexes them according to their multimedia content.

Reference-contexts: The Informedia project is developing new component technologies and embedding them in a video library system primarily for use in education and training. To establish the effectiveness of these technologies, the project is establishing an online digital video library consisting of over a thousand hours of video material. News-on-Demand <ref> [Hauptmann96] </ref> is a particular collection in the Informedia Digital Library that has served as a proving ground for automatic library creation techniques. In News-on-Demand, complete automation is the principal goal. <p> A basic premise of the Informedia project was that speech recognition generated transcripts could make it possible to search for and retrieve multimedia material <ref> [Hauptmann96] </ref>. The Informedia Digital Library System depends on text transcripts that allow effective indexing and retrieval of segments relevant to a query.

Reference-contexts: EVALUATING RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS IN THE FACE OF RECOGNITION ERRORS In the current work, information retrieval experiments were performed using data sets consisting of perfect text transcripts and transcripts created by the Sphinx-II speech recognition system <ref> [Hwang94] </ref>. Two evaluation experiments were carried out. Firstly, the magnitude of the effect on retrieval effectiveness of the speech recognition systems limited vocabulary was estimated. <p> The average news story length in this set was 418.5 words. For each of these shows with transcripts, a speech recognition transcript was generated from the audio using the Sphinx-II large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system <ref> [Hwang94] </ref> running with a 20,000 word dictionary and language model based on the Wall Street Journal from 1987-1994. Sphinx-II is a fairly standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based recognizer. Speech recognition for this data has a 50.7% Word Error Rate (WER) when compared to the JGI transcripts.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the Cambridge work described in the following paragraph has shown that a large vocabulary recognition system, if used alone, enables better retrieval effectiveness than an all-phone transcription. James <ref> [James95, James96] </ref> performed a first evaluation of the benefits of combining both recognized word and phoneme representation to improve information retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Thus it is impractical for all but small corpora and infrequent searches. Nevertheless, a substantial body of subsequent work has been done at Cambridge to demonstrate the utility of this sort of matching when it is available to a retrieval system. Jones et al. <ref> [Jones96, Brown95] </ref> used a specially constructed test set of 50 queries and 300 voice mail messages, from 15 speakers, designed to have on average 10.8 highly relevant documents per query. They measured precision at rank 5, 10, 15 and 20 and reported the average precision. <p> However, it is difficult to compare precision results of different queries in different document collections. Therefore, retrieval effectiveness for automatically transcribed spoken documents is conventionally also reported as the percentage to a comparable text retrieval system applied to perfect transcripts <ref> [Jones96] </ref>. Reporting the relative precision to retrieval from perfect text transcripts also has the advantage of abstracting from a particular metric and search engine used. The precision/recall metric has the drawback that a person (or, preferably, a number of people) must manually provide relevance judgments for the test data.

Reference-contexts: This latter term amounts to cosine normalization for the vector, and has proved helpful for speech documents, where large numbers of relatively rare words may be inserted by the recognition system. For the system using this scheme, stop words and stemming <ref> [Porter80] </ref> are also used. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METRICS USED The standard metrics for retrieval effectiveness in the information retrieval literature are precision and recall [Salton71]. Precision is defined as the number of correct (relevant) hits returned by the system divided by the number of total hits returned to the user.

Reference-contexts: The details of these experiments are given in the following sections. THE INFORMEDIA SEARCH ENGINE The Informedia search engine, SEIDX, does statistical document retrieval based on the vectorspace retrieval model <ref> [Salton71, Witten94] </ref>. Each document and each query is represented as a weighted sparse vector, with one element per possible term in the lexicon. Retrieval is done by ranking documents by the dot product between the query vector and the document vector. <p> For the system using this scheme, stop words and stemming [Porter80] are also used.

Precision is defined as the number of correct (relevant) hits returned by the system divided by the number of total hits returned to the user.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, an efficient solution to the problem through a combination of phonetic substring matching and full word retrieval is described. PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN IR FROM SPOKEN DOCUMENTS Some early work in information retrieval from a corpus of spoken documents was performed at ETH Zurich <ref> [Schuble95] </ref>. Without the aid of a large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer, Schuble and Wechsler resorted to a phonetic string representation.
