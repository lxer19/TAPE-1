Abstract: Polar forms simplify the construction of polynomial and piecewise polynomial curves and surfaces and lead to new surface representations and algorithms. This paper provides an introduction to polar forms and shows how polar forms yield closed form solutions to various recursive algorithms that are used in Computer Aided Geometric Design. As a consequence, we obtain a simple new labeling scheme for Bezier and B-spline curves and surfaces that allows us to label control points in a consistent and meaningful way. The presentation concludes with a survey of some recent new results that were obtained using polar forms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The main idea behind polar forms is best explained by a picture: Fig.1 shows a cubic Bezier curve F over the unit interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> together with its Bezier points and all the intermediate points that come up during evaluation of the curve at a parameter t using the de Casteljau Algorithm. New in this figure is the labeling scheme. <p> Note that the Boehm Algorithm is identical to the first step of the de Boor Algorithm. Other knot insertion algorithms, as, e.g., the OSLO Algorithm, have been studied in great detail in a sequence of papers by P.J. Barry and R.N. Goldman <ref> [1, 9] </ref>. A thorough treatment of this material can be found in [2]. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the miracle that B-spline curves are C nq -continuous at a knot of multiplicity q. <p> More recently, the polar approach to splines has been expanded and applied by various researchers. Seidel [16] applies polar forms directly to the B-spline blending functions and gives a simple development of B-splines from scratch. He also discusses the relationship between polar forms and knot insertion. Barry and Goldman <ref> [1, 9] </ref> relate polar forms to other B-spline approaches and use polar forms for a thorough discussion of knot insertion for B-splines. Lee [10] and Strom [21] also contribute to this area. Seidel [20] uses the geometry behind polar forms to extend polar forms to geometrically continuous spline curves.

Reference-contexts: The resulting computational scheme is illustrated by Fig.9. 9 A new multivariate B-spline scheme By combining B-patches and simplex splines, a new multivariate B-spline scheme has recently been developed in <ref> [3] </ref>. The new surface scheme is based on blending functions and control points, and allows to construct smooth piecewise polynomial surfaces over arbitrary triangulations of the parameter plane. Due to the given space limitations it is impossible to discuss the surface scheme in glory detail. <p> Polar forms have also been helpful in the development of new surface schemes. Seidel [17] introduces a new surface representation, the B-patch, which may be considered the analogue to a B-spline segment for surfaces. Dahmen, Micchelli, and Seidel <ref> [3] </ref> combine B-patches with simplex splines and develop the surface scheme of the preceding section. An implementation of this scheme is discussed in [8, 18]. The scheme allows to model smooth piecewise polynomial surfaces over arbitrary triangulations. 18
