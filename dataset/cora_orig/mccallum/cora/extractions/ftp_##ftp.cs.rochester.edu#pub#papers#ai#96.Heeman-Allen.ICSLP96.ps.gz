Abstract: Previous approaches to detecting and correcting speechrepairs have for the most part separated these two problems. In this paper, we present a statistical model of speech repairs that uses information about the possible correction to help decide whether a speech repair actually occurred. By better modeling the interactions between detection and correction, we are able to improve our detection results.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show how this model can use information about the proposed correction as evidence that a speech repair occurred. By interleaving detection and correction, we can better model the interdependencies that exist between these two tasks. 2. THE TRAINS CORPUS As part of the TRAINS project <ref> [1] </ref>, which is a long term research project to build a conversationally proficient planning assistant, we have collected a corpus of problem solving dialogs [8].

Reference-contexts: Given the interruption point, the type of repair, and the syntactic categories of the words involved, Hindle achieved a 97% correction rate and Kikui and Morimoto achieved a 94% correction rate in a Japanese corpus. However, a reliable acoustic signal has yet to be found <ref> [2] </ref>. Rather, 2 This classification is similar to that of Hindle [10] and Levelt [12]. To appear in ICSLP'96 detection of speech repairs probably relies on the combination of a number clues, both acoustic and lexical. <p> There are 915 modification repairs and 633 fresh starts, not including those whose reparandum is just a word fragment. These repairs have been hand-annotated. There is typically a correspondence between the reparandum and the alteration, and following <ref> [2] </ref>, we annotate this using the labels m for word matching and r for word replacements (words of the same syntactic category). Each pair is given a unique index. Other words in the reparandum and alteration are annotated with an x.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, the modification transition type follows the editing terms, which allows the editing terms to be used as part of the context in deciding the type of repair. To appear in ICSLP'96 use the set of POS categories. To estimate the probability distribution, we use a decision tree algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> that can ask questions of the following form. * Is there a word matching across this transition point? * Is the number of intervening words (between the closest word match) less than x? * Does one of the (closest) matching words have a POS category in the subset x (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Besides the word categories of the preceding words, this context can also include the presence of editing terms, silence, and word matches <ref> [5, 14] </ref>. <p> P (R i jContext i ) P (R i jS i )=P (R i ) P (R i jM i )=P (R i ) (1) For the probability P (R i jM i ), we follow <ref> [5] </ref> and take into consideration the number of intervening words for the closest match and its POS category. <p> CORRECTING SPEECH REPAIRS After a speech repair has been detected, we need to correct it. In <ref> [5] </ref>, we used well-formedness constraints to determine the correction of modification repairs. The well-formedness constraints make use of word correspondences to find the parallel structure that often exists between the reparandum and the alteration.

DETECTING SPEECH REPAIRS For detecting speech repairs, we use a statistical model based on a part-of-speech tagger.

Reference-contexts: Hence, strategies for speech repair detection and correction that separate these two tasks will be unable to account for a significant number of repairs. The only solution is to use the presence of a suitable correction as evidence in deciding if a repair actually occurred. In other work <ref> [7] </ref>, we propose a statistical model, based on a POS tagger, that can detect intonational phrase boundaries, interruption points of speech repairs, and editing terms. In this paper, we show how this model can use information about the proposed correction as evidence that a speech repair occurred. <p> In effect, we are viewing the problem as tagging null tokens between words with a tag that indicates if a speech repair occurred. Full details of this model and the interactions between tagging editing terms and intonational phrase endings are given in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Given the interruption point of a speech repair and the POS assignment, the correction algorithm should be able to find the word correspondences, like those given for the example in Section 2. In fact, running this routine with the correct POS assignments and correct interruption points of modification repairs <ref> [9] </ref> yields results comparable with those reported by Hindle [10] and Kikui and Morimoto [11].

Reference-contexts: For abridged repairs, there is no reparandum, and so simply knowing that it is abridged automatically gives the correction.

Although experiments by Lickley and Bard <ref> [13] </ref> have found that hearers were able to recognize a disfluency by the end of the first word of the alteration in 85.4% of the cases, this still leaves 16.6% of the repairs in their test set unaccounted for. In order to detect these, the hearer must need more context.
