Abstract: In this paper we report on the use of backpropagation based neural networks to implement a phase of the computational intelligence process of the PYTHIA[3] expert system for supporting the numerical simulation of applications modelled by partial differential equations (PDEs). PYTHIA is an exemplar based reasoning system that provides advice on what method and parameters to use for the simulation of a specified PDE based application. When advice is requested, the characteristics of the given model are matched with the characteristics of previously seen classes of models. The performance of various solution methods on previously seen similar classes of models is then used as a basis for predicting what method to use. Thus, a major step of the reasoning process in PYTHIA involves the analysis and categorization of models into classes of models based on their characteristics. In this study we demonstrate the use of neural networks to identify the class of predefined models whose characteristics match the ones of the specified PDE based application.

Reference-contexts: In order to assist the "novel" practitioner of scientific computing in the area of PDE based computational models, we have proposed [2] to utilize expert system technology to support a "smart" computational environment called //ELLPACK 2 <ref> [1] </ref>. The computational intelligence of this environment is realized by the PYTHIA expert system. PYTHIA is an exemplar based reasoning system that attempts to answer the question of which method to use to solve a given PDE problem. <p> In the case of second order, linear, elliptic boundary value problems on rectangular domains, a discussion of the codification of problem characteristics is presented in [4]. Each characteristic is also associated with a presence level ff, where ff* <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. (ff = 0 means pure absence of that property while ff = 1 means pure presence.) For logical characteristics (for example, whether the boundary conditions are Dirichlet or not), we use the values 0 and 1 for false and true, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 shows some of the characteristics that we use to characterize a PDE problem and its solution. In the case of second order, linear, elliptic boundary value problems on rectangular domains, a discussion of the codification of problem characteristics is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The success of this approach relies greatly then on having available a reasonably large population of various PDE problems whose characteristics span most of the space the space of all characteristic vectors. For the class of linear second order elliptic PDEs, PYTHIA uses the population defined in <ref> [4] </ref>. This population was created for use in the evaluation of numerical methods and software for solving PDEs. It consists of fifty-six linear, two-dimensional elliptic PDEs defined on rectangular domains. Forty-two of the problems are parametrized which leads to an actual problem space of more than two-hundred and fifty problems.

Reference-contexts: In other words, two (or more) classes may overlap. Traditional cluster analysis techniques very often assume that clusters are disjoint or hierarchical. The same assumption is made by some neural network based methods like LVQ <ref> [5] </ref> as well. An alternate view of the problem is to consider it as a mapping problem. Let us suppose that we represent the m classes by a vector of size m.

Reference-contexts: The population has been structured by introducing measures of complexity of the operator, boundary conditions, solution and problem. The population also contains information about the properties of the problems. This information is encoded as a bit-string and is accessible via the ELLPACK Performance Evaluation System (PES) <ref> [6] </ref>. These properties are transferred to the PYTHIA characteristic vector representation by an automated procedure. Characteristics not identified in the ELL-PACK PES are identified by the characteristic extraction component of PYTHIA. C. Classes of PDE Problems A class of problems is a collection of problems which have similar characteristics.

Reference-contexts: We split this data into two parts- one part contained two thirds of the exemplars and was used to train the network. The other part was used to test the performance of the trained network. All the simulations were performed using the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator <ref> [7] </ref>, a very useful public domain simulator with a convenient graphical interface. The first training algorithm used was a "vanilla" backpropagation routine. The learning rate is an important free parameter here.
