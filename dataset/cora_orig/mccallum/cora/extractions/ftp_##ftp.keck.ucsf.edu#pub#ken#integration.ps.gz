Abstract: To understand the interspike interval (ISI) variability displayed by visual cortical neurons (Softky and Koch, 1993), it is critical to examine the dynamics of their neuronal integration as well as the variability in their synaptic input current. Most previous models have focused on the latter factor. We match a simple integrate-and-fire model to the experimentally measured integrative properties of cortical regular spiking cells (McCormick et al., 1985). After setting RC parameters, the post-spike voltage reset is set to match experimental measurements of neuronal gain (obtained from in vitro plots of firing frequency vs. injected current). Examination of the resulting model leads to an intuitive picture of neuronal integration that unifies the seemingly contradictory "1= p N arguments hold and spiking is regular; after the "memory" of the last spike becomes negligible, spike threshold crossing is caused by input variance around a steady state, and spiking is Poisson. In integrate-and-fire neurons matched to cortical cell physiology, steady state behavior is predominant and ISI's are highly variable at all physiological firing rates and for a wide range of inhibitory and excitatory inputs.

Reference-contexts: As an alternative to simple integration, Softky and Koch (1993) proposed that active dendritic conductances may act to amplify sub-millisecond coincidences in synaptic input, leading to large random pulses of synaptic current. Thus, they suggested that high ISI variability may be more consistent with the notion <ref> (Abeles, 1982) </ref> of neurons acting as "coincidence detectors" rather than "rate encoders." Shadlen and Newsome (1994), following Gerstein and Mandelbrot (1964), argued that if uncorrelated synaptic inputs to a cell consist of balanced excitation and inhibition, then the membrane voltage follows a "random walk", leading to ISIs that are quite variable.

Reference-contexts: Other models demonstrated that network dynamics can lead to correlations among synaptic inputs sufficient to yield high variability (Usher et al., 1994; Hansel and Sompolinsky, 1996) (N.B., afferent inputs also have significant correlations <ref> (Alonso et al., 1996) </ref>). However, these investigations generally did not address the sensitivity of cortical neurons.

Reference-contexts: Thus "balanced inhibition", which reduces t and increases input variability, and "high gain" mechanisms are independent effects that both can contribute to variable spiking. It has been suggested <ref> (Bell et al., 1995) </ref> that spike variability depends on the cell "hovering" near threshold, so that the integration of only a few inputs can cause a spike. While this is similar to our explanation of steady state behavior, there is a significant difference.

The mix of fast and slow synapses gives a realistically high CV2. 11 of these mechanisms to cortical integration. Stronger constraints may be found from experiments designed to probe the biophysical basis of integration and spiking in cortical cells, and from further statistical studies.

Reference-contexts: reset, there is a post-spike elevation of theshold that decays at some rate (reviewed in Tuckwell, 1988, Table 3.1). 3 We use a simple, conductance-based integrate-and-fire model: C @t = g leak (V rest V ) + I (1) Parameters were matched to slice recordings of regular spiking cells 5 <ref> (values from McCormick et al., 1985, noted in parentheses) </ref>: V rest = 74 (73:61:5) mV ; 1=g leak = 40 (39:9 21:2) M ; C = t g leak where t = 20 (20:2 14:6) msec: The absolute refractory period was taken to be the spike width, t spike = 1:75 <p> nS msec. g syn was taken from an exponential distribution with mean g syn ; values greater than 4g syn were then reset to 5 The term "regular spiking" denotes the class of cortical cells that respond to constant current injection in vitro with single spike firing and spike-rate adaptation <ref> (McCormick et al., 1985) </ref>. These constitute most cortical excitatory cells. <p> For comparison, the dotted line represents the more common "low gain" model, in which V reset is set to V rest . Experimental data shown are piecewise linear fits to data for first interspike interval from three cells <ref> (McCormick et al. 1985, fig 1) </ref>. B. ISI histogram from 10 sec of model data: ex = 7015 Hz; in = 3263 Hz (R = :75); average firing rate = 98:4 Hz; CV = :6. Inset shows ISIs &gt; 20 msec. C. <p> This fits well with the empirical observations that all excitatory cortical neurons show spike rate adaptation, while most inhibitory cortical neurons do not adapt but can sustain high rates of firing without saturating <ref> (McCormick et al., 1985) </ref>. Our high gain model results in ISI variability that falls in the lower half of the range .5 to 1 reported in Softky and Koch (1993). If one includes the refractory period, even a Poisson model can not account for the upper reaches of this data.

Reference-contexts: One recent technique that may shed light on the contribution of cortical inhibition is the ability to pharmacologically block inhibitory input to a single cell <ref> (Nelson et al., 1994) </ref>. To understand cortical ISI variability, classical notions of neuronal integration must be modified, not by abandoning the integrate-and-fire neuron, but by deepening our understanding of the dynamics of such model neurons.

Reference-contexts: The leak current adds hyperpolarizing current. Estimates for ex and in rely on counting arguments only weakly constrained by experimental data <ref> (Shadlen and Newsome, 1994) </ref>. Thus, to examine how model behavior depends on ex and in , we fix R and then covary ex and in to yield varying output firing rates for that R.

Reference-contexts: In the initial refractory regime, the state of the neuron is dominated by the recovery from the previous spike. In this regime, 1= p N arguments are valid <ref> (Smith, 1992) </ref> and spiking is regular. In the final, steady state regime, the memory of the last spike has decayed and random synaptic variation causes the cell to fluctuate about some steady state mean voltage (necessarily subthreshold).

Reference-contexts: A careful examination of this model leads to a relatively simple, intuitive picture of cortical neuronal integration that unifies the seemingly contradictory "1= p N " and "random walk" pictures that have been previously proposed. A preliminary report of this study has appeared as an abstract <ref> (Troyer and Miller, 1995) </ref>. 1 Bell et al. (1995) and Wilbur and Rinzel (1983) also investigated bistability in neuronal dynamics as a mechanism that could contribute to ISI variability. 2 2 The High-Gain Model In an integrate-and-fire model, the slower, integrative properties of neurons are modeled as passive changes in subthreshold <p> One difficulty with high gain models is that they display low dynamic range, i.e. relatively small fluctuations in input current can lead to saturated outputs. In other studies <ref> (Troyer and Miller, 1995 and in preparation) </ref>, we have found that spike rate adaptation helps to solve this problem by providing negative feedback that reduces gain on longer time scales, while preserving sensitivity to small input fluctuations on the time scale of typical interspike intervals.

Reference-contexts: currents, however, it is most useful to combine all factors contributing to the reduction. 4 Alternatively, one may consider a two (or three) parameter model of refractoriness in which, instead of (or in addition to) post-spike voltage reset, there is a post-spike elevation of theshold that decays at some rate <ref> (reviewed in Tuckwell, 1988, Table 3.1) </ref>. 3 We use a simple, conductance-based integrate-and-fire model: C @t = g leak (V rest V ) + I (1) Parameters were matched to slice recordings of regular spiking cells 5 (values from McCormick et al., 1985, noted in parentheses): V rest = 74 (73:61:5)
