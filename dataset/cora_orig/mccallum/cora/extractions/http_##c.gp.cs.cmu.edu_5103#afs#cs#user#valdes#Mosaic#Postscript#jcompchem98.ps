Abstract: Isotopic labeling experiments can be highly informative in reaction pathway studies, but inferring the implications of a mechanistic hypothesis can be difficult, especially in the case of complex r e-actions. We report systematic methods for predicting the distribution of labeled products and i n-termediates given (1) a mechanistic hypothesis, and (2) a proposed labeling experiment. The methods have been implemented within MECHEM a computer aid for elucidating reaction mechanisms. As illustration, we predict the outcomes of ethylene and propylene hydrogenation and n-heptane dehydrocyclization, for a variety of mechanisms and labeling experiments.

Formalizing symmetry for polyvalent atoms is more difficult and has not been done yet.
