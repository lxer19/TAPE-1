Abstract: We present a transport protocol that uses IP multicasting to provide reliable multicast transport services for distributed applications. The Transport Protocol for Reliable Multicast (TRM) has a receiver-oriented style of defining group membership and the lack of group information at the source. The distributed nature of the group membership information within TRM ensures scalability, which we believe is an important requirement. TRM uses a many-to-many communication model in which any of the participants can become a source of data. TRM guarantees the statistical reliability of message delivery without any guarantee of the reliability of the group membership. Group management and group membership functions are assumed to be handled by the session layer and the application. TRM delegates the responsibility of ensuring reliable message delivery to the receivers, which use a negative acknowledgment (NACK)-based scheme with message damping to request retransmissions of missing data. The sources send heartbeats periodically (to the multicast group) to let every member of the group know about its own state when there is no data to transmit. TRM also supports late joins, early leaves, and source-specific joins.

Reference-contexts: Because of the difficulties of meeting multicast application needs, no single, widely accepted reliable multicast protocol yet exists. Several illustrative protocols, however, do exist. We briefly describe four such protocols below: Chang and Maxemchuk <ref> [1] </ref>, XTP [13], Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) [8], and the Reliable Adaptive Multicast Protocol (RAMP) [17]. The Chang and Maxemchuk protocol [1] is one of the early works in the field of reliable multicast protocols. <p> Several illustrative protocols, however, do exist.

The Chang and Maxemchuk protocol [1] is one of the early works in the field of reliable multicast protocols. In this protocol, all the members are ordered in a logical ring, with one of them having the token. The site with the token performs most of the functions in order to provide for reliable delivery.

In the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol <ref> [8] </ref>, all the members join the multicast group, and there is no distinction between senders and receivers. Each member sends low rate periodic session messages that announce the highest sequence number received from each active source. <p> Note also that since we are employing a go-back-N retransmission scheme, the packets at the source are released only in sequence. 11 The source computes an RT D sample (as shown in Figure 2) for a particular receiver <ref> [8] </ref> when it receives a NACK from that receiver. This sample is used to update the RT D estimate for the receiver as: newRT D estimate = fl fi RT D sample + (1 fl) fi oldRT D estimate where fl is between 0 and 1 (e.g., fl = 1=2).

Reference-contexts: However, this approach not only wastes network resources, but also scales poorly since the sender has to manage as many connections as there are receivers. A number of protocols have been proposed for reliable multicast (The interested reader is referred to <ref> [15] </ref> which contains a survey of these protocols). Because of the difficulties of meeting multicast application needs, no single, widely accepted reliable multicast protocol yet exists. Several illustrative protocols, however, do exist.

TRM was used by a multicast-aware proxy Web server in this DBS environment that multicasted Web pages of interest to Web servers at DBS downlink sites <ref> [16] </ref>. The rest of this section is organized as follows. First, we summarize prior work in reliable multicast protocols using a small number of reliable multicast protocols for illustration in Section 2. Next, we discuss the basic design philosophy of TRM and its components in Section 3. <p> These same receiver oriented mechanisms allow for greater protocol scalability and receiver heterogeneity. In addition, the protocol design allows for customization to hybrid internetworks which includes unidirectional and assymetric networks <ref> [16] </ref>. Currently we have observed that the go-back-n scheme of retransmission generates large volumes of re-transmitted that may not be necessary. A selective retransmission scheme will provide a significant reduction in such retransmitted traffic.

Individual members use a token bucket rate limiter to enforce the peak rate on transmissions. The Reliable Adaptive Multicast Protocol (RAMP) <ref> [17] </ref> is a transport-level protocol designed to provide reliable multicast service on top of a network protocol such as IP/Multicast.
