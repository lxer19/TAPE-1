Abstract: Underactuated manipulators are a class of robotic mechanisms where passive joints are present. By controlling only the motion of the active joints, it is possible to control the entire system. Our goal is to develop control schemes using both classical nonlinear and modern learning techniques for underactuated manipulators. To examine the validity of the approaches, we developed an experimental setup known as U-ARM, or UnderActuated Robot Manipulator. In this paper, we present the hardware development, dynamic parameters, control software and experimental results of real-time control of the U-ARM.

In both schemes, accurate dynamic models were assumed to be known.

It is local in nature, and provides the control system with a direct measure of the coupling available to drive the passive joints using only the torques at the active ones. <p> In this case, a global coupling index can be easily defined, and it will measure the coupling between the joints at all points in the joint space. We refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref> for more details on the concept of the local and global coupling indexes.

Control schemes based on simulations may not work when later transferred to the actual system. In order to demonstrate the validity of the robust controller we proposed for underactuated manipulators <ref> [3] </ref>, we built a two-link system with one passive joint. The mechanism is called U-ARM, or UnderActuated Robot Manipulator. In this paper we present the hardware development of the U-ARM, and describe the real-time control architecture written under the operating system Chimera 3.2. <p> In both schemes, accurate dynamic models were assumed to be known. Since one can always expect uncertainties and disturbances to be present in a dynamic system, we proposed a robust control technique for underactuated manipulators <ref> [3] </ref>. It consists on a variable structure controller (VSC) that forces the state trajectory to converge to a pre-defined sliding surface in the state space. We will present here the results of the application of this technique on U-ARM.

Reference-contexts: However, if one is interested in Cartesian space control of underactuated manipulators, it may be more important to consider the actuability of the mechanism <ref> [4] </ref>. Our future research will include the assembly of a four-link manipulator with joints that can be chosen to be either active or passive at the beginning of each experiment. This way, more interesting experiments can be performed, and a better understanding of this class of systems can be gained.

Control schemes based on simulations may not work when later transferred to the actual system. <p> Note also that the coupling index is greater when joint 1 is active, because the second links is too light to drive the first joint. For this reason, we built U-ARM with its first joint active. An important theorem must be cited at this point. Oriolo et al. <ref> [5] </ref> proved that the dynamic equations of an underactuated system cannot be integrated in the general case. In other words, only for specific mechanisms it will be possible to obtain a relationship between the passive and active joints velocities or positions.
