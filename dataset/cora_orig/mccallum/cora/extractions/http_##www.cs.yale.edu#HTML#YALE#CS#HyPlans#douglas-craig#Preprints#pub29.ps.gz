Title: AN ABSTRACT THEORY FOR THE DOMAIN REDUCTION METHOD  
Author: CRAIG C. DOUGLAS AND JAN MANDEL 
Keyword: Key words. Parallel Computing, Group Representation, Group Algebras, Symmetries, Partial Differential Equations, Boundary Value Problems  
Abstract: The domain reduction method uses a finite group of symmetries of a system of linear equations arising by discretization of partial differential equations to obtain a decomposition into independent subproblems, which can be solved in parallel. This paper develops a theory for this class of methods based on known results from group representation theory and algebras of finite groups. The main theoretical result is that if the problem splits into subproblems based on isomorphic subdomains, then the group of symmetries must be commutative. General decompositions are then obtained by nesting decompositions based on commutative groups of symmetries. 1. Introduction. This paper is concerned with the problem of decomposing a

The first is to extend the problem domain to one where similar boundary conditions are symmetric in some obvious manner (see <ref> [5] </ref>). The 21 second is to find a reasonable problem similar to the original problem with symmetric boundary conditions. The approximate problem can then be used as a preconditioner in an iterative method for the solution of the original problem (see [8]). 10. Examples. Example 10.1.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of the domain reduction method is to split the solution space into invariant subspaces of a group of symmetries. This paper is based on the observation that such decompositions are studied in the group representation theory and their properties are well known <ref> [12] </ref>. In particular, the decomposition can be shown to be uniquely defined by the group under suitable assumptions. The projection operators are linear combinations of the symmetries of the solution space, which lends itself to analysis in the framework of group algebras, which consist of all such linear combinations. <p> So, LV i ~ V i ; as in the earlier case. 3. Group Algebra. The projections given by (2.6) can be studied using group algebras. The basic results that are pertinent to this paper from the theories of groups and group algebras are reviewed, following <ref> [12] </ref>. For a finite group G, the associated group algebra A is the set of formal sums X c (G)G (3.1) where c (G) are scalars. <p> A is equipped with the structure of a linear space and vector multiplication, X c (G)G H2G X X c (G)d (H)GH X X c (F H 1 )d (H) F; where the substitution F = GH and rearrangement were used <ref> [12, p. 86] </ref>. We shall assume that the group G is linearly independent (3.3) as a set of linear operators on V . <p> It is easy to see that a left ideal J of A is an invariant subspace of the group G, GJ J ; 8G 2 G; and any invariant subspace of G is a left ideal of A <ref> [12, p. 91] </ref>. If J is a left ideal, then every G 2 G defines a linear mapping of J into itself by left multiplication restricted to J , which we denote by G L j J . <p> Two left ideals J 1 and J 2 are equivalent if the corresponding representations are equivalent in the sense that there exists an invertible linear mapping A : J 1 ! J 2 such that Ga = AGA 1 a; 8a 2 J 2 ; G 2 G;(3.5) (cf., <ref> [12, pp. 66, 96] </ref>). In particular, note that two equivalent ideals have the same dimension and that the images of the representations (3.4) are isomorphic groups. A minimal ideal is an ideal which does not contain any nontrivial ideal of the same type. <p> Thus, a minimal left ideal contains no left ideals except the trivial ideal f0g and itself. The following theorem applied recursively shows that any left ideal is a direct sum of minimal left ideals. Theorem 3.1. (Maschke's Theorem <ref> [12, p. 73] </ref>) Let J and J 0 be left ideals of A, and J 0 J . <p> Then there exists a left ideal J 00 such that J = J 0 J 00 : Thus, the algebra itself can be decomposed into minimal left ideals: Theorem 3.2. <ref> [12, p. 92] </ref> The group algebra A of G is the direct sum of minimal left ideals: A = J 1 J m : A = J 0 m 0 is another decomposition of A into minimal left ideals, then m = m 0 and after renumbering, the ideals J i <p> Note that when is understood as a linear operator on V , it is then a projection onto a subspace of V . For any element b 2 A, is a left ideal that is called the principal ideal generated by b. Theorem 3.3. <ref> [12, p. 97] </ref> Let A be the direct sum of nontrivial left ideals, A = J 1 J m :(3.6) Then there exist unique idempotents 1 ; ; m which form a decomposition of unity, 1 + + m = I on A;(3.7) and each i generates the corresponding ideal J <p> This is an 7 advantage since it allows more flexibility. It is also a disadvantage since it is not clear how to choose the minimal left ideals. This nonuniqueness is removed by considering two-sided ideals instead. Theorem 3.5. <ref> [12, p. 103] </ref> Let the group algebra A be the direct sum of minimal left ideals J i , i = 1; ; m. For each equivalence class of left ideals J i , let I j be the direct sum of all left ideals in that class. <p> For each equivalence class of left ideals J i , let I j be the direct sum of all left ideals in that class. Then A = I 1 I ` ; and each I j is a minimal two-sided ideal. Theorem 3.6. <ref> [12, p. 104] </ref> The decomposition of A into a direct sum of minimal two-sided ideals is unique up to renumbering the components. Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 characterize the structure of the algebra of a finite group. <p> Theorem 3.6. [12, p. 104] The decomposition of A into a direct sum of minimal two-sided ideals is unique up to renumbering the components. Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 characterize the structure of the algebra of a finite group. Theorem 3.7. <ref> [12, p. 107] </ref> In any decomposition of A into minimal left ideals, the number of minimal left ideals equivalent to one minimal left ideal J i equals the dimension of J i . <p> In particular, the dimension of any two-sided ideal I is k 2 , where k is the number of minimal left ideals in any decomposition of I into minimal left ideals. Theorem 3.8. <ref> [12, p. 110] </ref> The restriction of A to a minimal two-sided ideal I is isomorphic with the algebra of all linear mappings on I. Suppose a basis of A is chosen so that each minimal two-sided ideal is spanned by a subset of the basis. <p> Such a basis is called a symmetry basis of A. An algorithm for the construction of a symmetry basis is not known in the general (non-commutative) case, but methods are known for certain special groups <ref> [12, p. 112] </ref>. In particular, symmetry bases are known for all crystallographic groups, which covers perhaps all two-dimensional cases important in practice [14]. If the group G is commutative, then two-sided and left ideals coincide and can be called simply ideals. Theorems 3.3-3.6 then give the following. Theorem 3.9. <p> If ^ i are the idempotents corresponding to this decomposition, then any decomposition (2.3)-(2.6) can be obtained by adding subsets of the set of projections ^ i . It is known that over the complex field, all minimal ideals of the algebra of a commutative group are one-dimensional <ref> [12, p. 81] </ref>. The group algebra A in such a case is isomorphic to the space of all diagonal matrices of order jGj. Also, the number of minimal left ideals in the decomposition equals jGj.

Then the geometry of the mesh, in addition to its shape may further limit the group of symmetries.

The subspace V i , given by (2.4), is represented by functions on one or more fundamental domains according to Theorem 5.1. <p> However, some of those reduced problems possess less symmetry because of the introduced boundary conditions, which may eventually prevent some reduced problem from being decomposed further.
