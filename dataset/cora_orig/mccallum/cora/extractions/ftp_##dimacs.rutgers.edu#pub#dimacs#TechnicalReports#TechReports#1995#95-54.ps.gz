Reference-contexts: In this paper we will only make claims about simple sequences. The starting point of our investigations is the following "metric" generalization of Ramsey's theorem, which was also proved independently by Noga Alon. (For a quantitative version of this result, see a forthcoming paper of Shelah <ref> [S95] </ref>.) Theorem 0.

Reference-contexts: Suppose next that G (x) 62 J for some x 2 !. Szemeredi's theorem <ref> [SZ75] </ref> now implies that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in G (x) and, just like in the previous case, we can find an independent set fm i : i &lt; kg G (x) which is distance similar to njk.
