Abstract: ALLONS-D is a decentralized real-time traffic control scheme. A description of its basic architecture, system model, and optimization algorithm is given. Through simulations, the scheme is shown to be suitable for adaptive control of an isolated intersection. An efficient tree searching algorithm is used to find a traffic signal plan that minimizes delay. The search is constrained only by maximum and minimum green times per phase. This algorithm is free to consider cyclic and non-cyclic signal plans alike. The rolling horizon concept is used for the calculation and implementation of optimal signal plans. The ALLONS-D scheme has several key differences with other real-time traffic control schemes, such as OPAC. Extensive simulation experiments on a single intersection indicate the success of the ALLONS-D scheme versus any fixed-cycle plan. The tests included a full range of uniform and non-uniform demands from low levels of saturation to the over-saturated case. For arterial networks of intersections, the scheme is shown to be capable of inducing a level of coordination that results in progressive signal plans. In particular, the scheme can be used to coordinate travel times on transit routes. An extension of the scheme to provide network-wide optimization of traffic signals is explained in the form of a two-layer scheme. Some preliminary results using this approach are included. Simulation experiments are performed with a newly developed traffic simulator called STNS.

Reference-contexts: Its objective is to minimize the total delay experienced by traffic at each intersection in a given network. The primary feature distinguishing ALLONS-D from schemes such as SCOOT <ref> [2] </ref> and SCATS [3, 4] is that it is not constrained to generate cyclic signal plans. Any arbitrary phase sequencing and phase splits are permitted subject only to constraints of a minimum green time and a maximum green time for each phase.

Reference-contexts: These constraints are in the interests of safety and fairness, respectively. ALLONS-D can consider additional priority for vehicles of different types or occupancy levels in the traffic stream. Rolling Horizon, as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers <ref> [5] </ref>. It is a strategy utilized in other tested traffic control schemes such as OPAC [6, 7], PRODYN [8], and UTOPIA [9, 10]. This paper discusses some of the distinguishing features of ALLONS-D relative to these other methods. <p> The difficulty in accurately forecasting vehicle arrivals for any lengthy segment (or horizon) of time influences the desire for a rolling horizon implementation of these schemes. Recent studies have shown that short roll periods are sufficient <ref> [5] </ref>. How the horizon is chosen and set is a key distinguishing characteristic between various plans of this type. For example, the horizon could be a preset, fixed time period, or it could be variable in some way.

Reference-contexts: The queue lengths and arrival information required by the optimizer could be made available in one of several ways: by upstream detectors located on all approaches to the intersection, by a combination of upstream and downstream detectors, or via surveillance cameras like AUTOSCOPE <ref> [12] </ref>. The intersection controller requires knowledge of the exact time at which the vehicle arrives at the end of the link and the queue that the arrivals join upon reaching the intersection.

Reference-contexts: The search essentially uses a branch and bound technique and is done in two parts. The first part is a depth-first search to find an initial path in the tree. The second part is a backtracking <ref> [13] </ref> procedure. Specifically, the tree is searched by continuously exploring nodes at increasing depths until an end node is reached. An end node is a state where the stopping criterion is met. This is equivalent to having all anticipated arriving vehicles on each link cleared from the intersection.

Reference-contexts: The systems SCATS and SCOOT are prime examples. The SCOOT (Split, Cycle and Offset Optimizer) system attempts an incremental optimization of cycle time, phase split, and offset, and it is based on a platoon dispersion and queue profile traffic model similar to that of the off-line scheme TRANSYT <ref> [17] </ref>. SCATS (The Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System) optimizes cycle length, phase split, and offset so as to maintain the highest degree of saturation in the traffic network. Automatic coordination procedures are usually unique to each system.

Reference-contexts: This is a sort of feed-forward control and it requires detectors upstream of the stop line (See Fig. 1). Coordination efforts may or may not be involved. Another proposed scheme similar to ALLONS-D is COP (Controlled Optimization of Phases) <ref> [20] </ref>. It is a decentralized adaptive control scheme for an intersection that assumes that detectors will predict vehicle arrivals sufficiently so that a forward dynamic program can determine an optimal signal plan.

Reference-contexts: The SPOT controller utilizes the rolling horizon implementation strategy with a roll period of 120 seconds and implementing the first six seconds of calculated signal plans. The area level controller provides weights for the cost functions for each of the SPOT intersection controllers <ref> [21] </ref>. Weights are selected based on macroscopic flow considerations, movement of transit vehicles, data gathered from local controllers, and other considerations. In general, the weights are used to establish preferred routes in the network. <p> Goals of such systems include allowing a bus that is perhaps behind schedule to save time, reducing overall delay along transit routes, and thus improving consistency on routes. For an overview 15 16 of some existing systems, the reader is referred to <ref> [21] </ref> and [26]. Bus Priority Systems can be categorized into two types: active priority and passive priority. Active priority systems allow a bus driver (or other transit operator) to command a nearby traffic light directly.

Reference-contexts: It is also impractical to compare different schemes in a real-world setting. Testing via simulation is used here as a practical, albeit less realistic, alternative. For the purposes of this research, we developed an open, uncomplicated and simple traffic network simulator that we call STNS <ref> [22] </ref>. STNS is a mesoscopic simulator; individual vehicles are accounted for but travel times for a link are determined by an impedance function that considers link occupancy.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, the use of weights for certain phases at the intersections of a network is utilized as a tool. The purpose is to coordinate the control action of the individual controllers at the intersections in an effort to improve the network-wide performance. As described for a similar problem in <ref> [28] </ref>, this coincides with a concept from welfare economics: decentralized control to optimize local objectives leads to optimization of global objectives if the externalities are internalized. Along these lines, the weights factor in the global effect of any local decision.
