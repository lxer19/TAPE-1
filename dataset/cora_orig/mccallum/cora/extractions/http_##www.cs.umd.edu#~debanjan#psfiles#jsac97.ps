Abstract: One of the major attractions of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks for transporting bursty video traffic is its ability to exploit the multiplexing gains of packet switching while providing quality of service guarantees. Unfortunately, most of the multiplexing mechanisms proposed in the literature fail to exploit the multiplexing gains of ATM. In this paper we propose a multirate service mechanism that allows a session to be served at different rates at different of times. Applications generating bursty data, such as VBR video, can take advantage of multirate service by requesting for a high rate of service for brief periods of bursty arrivals and a much lower rate of service for all other times. Consequently, the applications can improve their delay performance without reserving a high bandwidth for the entire duration of the sessions. Furthermore, the scheduler can multiplex the peaks and the lulls in service rates of different sessions and improve the utilization of the system. Using MPEG video traces from a number of applications, we show that multirate servers outperform single rate PGPS (Packet-by-packet Generalized Processor Sharing) servers and CBR (Constant Bit Rate) servers, in terms of number of connections admitted, while providing the same level of service guarantees. We also investigate the performance of multirate service when service quality need not be guaranteed. We refer to this as predictive service. We propose a measurement based admission control procedure for predictive service and show that it helps increase the size of the admissible region even further.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the major attractions of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks is its ability to exploit the multiplexing gains of packet switching while providing quality of service guarantees. A number of service architectures have been proposed <ref> [1] </ref> to realize this goal. At the heart of all of these service architectures is a multiplexing policy that is used to allocate link capacities to competing connections at the switching nodes.

Reference-contexts: The end-to-end delay is computed as the sum of the delays at the switching nodes on the path of the connection. The multiplexing disciplines providing throughput guarantees <ref> [2, 7, 15, 25, 20, 19, 18] </ref> typically use variations of fair queueing or frame based scheduling to guarantee a minimum rate of service at each switching node.

Reference-contexts: The cell buffer address is returned to the idle address FIFO. The most complex part of the buffer manager is the sequencer. It is a priority queue ordered in the increasing order of the time stamps. For a detailed design and implementation of the sequencer refer to <ref> [3] </ref>. Note that any implementation of time stamp based scheduling such as PGPS, SFQ, or virtual clock, has to use a sequencer or a similar component.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, neither the average rate, nor the peak rate is a good choice. As a matter of fact no single rate is good choice since the source generates traffic at different rates at different times. The ideal approach is to have a service curve <ref> [4] </ref> 2 that mimics the traffic generation pattern of the source. Unfortunately, this is not a feasible since: (a) it is difficult to capture the traffic generation pattern of an arbitrary source accurately, and (b) it results in 1 In general, jIj, jP j, and jBj are random variables. <p> We also present the admission control algorithms for both guaranteed and predictive services. In general, the service curve <ref> [4] </ref> for a session can be any convex function of piece-wise linear components, where each component corresponds to a different rate of service over a period of time.

Reference-contexts: Multiplexing mechanisms proposed for ATM networks can be broadly divided into two classes: (a) ones that provide guarantees on maximum delay at the switching nodes, and (b) ones that guarantee a minimum throughput. The multiplexing disciplines providing delay guarantees <ref> [24, 5] </ref> typically use static or dynamic priority based scheduling to bound the worst case delay of a connection at each switching node. The end-to-end delay is computed as the sum of the delays at the switching nodes on the path of the connection.

Reference-contexts: We propose a measurement based admission control procedure for predictive service and show that it helps increase the size of the admissible region even further. Except for some very recent works, multirate service mechanisms have not undergone a very through investigation. In <ref> [6] </ref> a hop-by-hop shaping mechanism is proposed. It can be adapted to provide multirate service. However, the impact of this service mechanism on real life application traffic is not addressed. A multiple time scale characterization of traffic has been proposed in [12, 11].

Reference-contexts: In the predictive service, the same admission control process is administered with the difference that instead of worst case estimate, we use a measurement based estimate of traffic arrivals <ref> [10] </ref>. Using MPEG video traces from a variety of real life applications (including news clips, basketball games, class lecture, and music videos), we have shown that multirate servers outperform single-rate PGPS servers and CBR servers in terms of number of connections admitted while providing the same level of service guarantees.

Reference-contexts: While a fixed rate of service is adequate for constant bit rate traffic, it is quite unsuitable for bursty traffic, such as variable bit rate (VBR) video. For example, an MPEG <ref> [13] </ref> coded video stream generates traffic at significantly different rates at different times and no single rate service is sufficient to transport it across the network. We propose a multirate service mechanism to address this problem. In our scheme, a connection is served at different rates at different times.

Reference-contexts: Several shaping mechanisms enforcing different classes of traffic envelopes have been proposed in the literature. The most popular among them are leaky bucket, jumping window and moving window <ref> [16] </ref>. In this paper we restrict ourselves to leaky bucket shapers only. However, the techniques developed here can be extended to moving and jumping window shapers also. A leaky bucket shaper consists of a token counter and a timer.
