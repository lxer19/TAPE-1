Abstract: We describe an experimental system implemented using the Java(TM) programming language which demonstrates a variety of application-level tradeoffs available to distributed natural language processing (NLP) applications. In the context of the World Wide Web (WWW), it is possible to provide value added functionality to legacy documents in a client side browser, a document server or an intermediary agent. Using a well-known ngram-based algorithm for automatic language identification, we have constructed a system to dynamically add language labels for whole documents and text fragments. We have experimented with several client/server configurations, and present the results of tradeoffs made between labelling accuracy and the size/completeness of the language models .

Reference-contexts: Second, sparse training data is a significant factor in ngram modeling, even at the level of character co-occurrences, since we consider character sequences up to 5 characters in length. We have experimented with simple add-k smoothing and, noting known problems with that method <ref> (Gale and Church, 1990) </ref>, we have also experimented with Good-Turing smoothing (Good, 1953) finding, to our surprise, that the simple "add 1 2 " is only slightly less accurate.
