Abstract: Co-evolution of competitive species provides an interesting testbed to study the role of adaptive behavior because it provides unpredictable and dynamic environments. In this paper we experimentally investigate some arguments for the co-evolution of different adaptive protean behaviors in competing species of predators and preys. Both species are implemented as simulated mobile robots (Kheperas) with infrared proximity sensors, but the predator has an additional vision module whereas the prey has a maximum speed set to twice that of the predator. Different types of variability during life for neurocontrollers with the same architecture and genetic length are compared. It is shown that simple forms of pro-teanism affect co-evolutionary dynamics and that preys rather exploit noisy controllers to generate random trajectories, whereas predators benefit from directional-change controllers to improve pursuit behavior.

Reference-contexts: Given the ubiquity of co-evolution in nature, the relative lack of bio-historical evidence for its role in adaptive progress, and the strong assumptions underlying simple mathematical models developed so far, Artificial Life techniques, such as computer simulations of artificial evolution, are a suitable method to study this phenomenon <ref> [1] </ref>. On the ontogenetic time-scale, it has been argued that pursuit-evasion contests might favor the emergence of "protean behaviors", that is behaviors which are adaptively unpredictable [4]. For example, preys could take advantage of unpredictable escape behaviors based on short sequences of stochastic motor actions. <p> Recently, they also described initial results from computer simulations of artificial co-evolution of competing agents controlled by continuous-time recurrent neural networks [2], and developed a set of techniques for analyzing and assessing adaptive progress of both populations <ref> [1] </ref>. Artificial coevolution of competitive species has been studied also by other researchers using similar methods, such as Ray's "Tierra" system [13], Sim's creatures [15], and Reynolds' pursuer-evader systems [14]. <p> Two populations of 100 individuals each were co-evolved for 100 generations. Each individual was tested against the best competitors of the ten previous generations (a similar procedure was used in <ref> [15, 14, 1] </ref>) in order to improve co-evolutionary stability. <p> In all conditions, the first bit of each synapse coded its sign (whether excitatory or inhibitory). In the first condition, the remaining four bits coded the synaptic strength as a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: since no changes take place during the life of the individuals, 1 In preliminary experiments, we compared various evolutionary runs with different pc, and a less severe selection scheme (50 parents out of 100 individuals), but none of these changes affected evolutionary dynamics and outcomes. let us call them <p> In the second condition, only two bits coded the synaptic strength (again, in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>), and the remaining two bits coded the level of random noise applied to the synaptic value. Each level corresponded to the lower and upper bounds of a uniform noise distribution: 0:0 (no noise), 0:337, 0:667, and 1:0. <p> After decoding a genotype into the corresponding controller, each synapse was randomly initialised to a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and modified at each time step according to the corresponding hebbian rule and learning rate. <p> Therefore, for all conditions we show the average fitness of the two competing species along with two types of analysis developed by Cliff and Miller to measure progress in coevolutionary competitive systems <ref> [1] </ref>. The first, which they dubbed "CIAO data" (Current Individual vs. <p> However, for co-evolution between different species to be a powerful engine of evolutionary progress, it would be advisable to employ a genetic encoding which takes better care of achieved progress, for example as in the work by Cliff and Miller <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In very recent work, which will be briefly summarized below, we have investigated the potentiality of the Red Queen effect for evolutionary robotics, and showed that, with a suitable combination of realistic simulations and measuring techniques, competitive co-evolution can develop a variety of efficient behaviors without effort in fitness design <ref> [7] </ref>. However, none of these experimental researches systematically explored the role of ontogenetic adaptive behavior in co-evolution of competing species. <p> different types of protean strategies, and how does this affect the competitor's behavior? In the attempt to investigate these issues in very simple settings, we have compared co-evolution of competing species equipped with different types of simple adaptive controllers with results from previous experiments where the controllers were genetically determined <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Method As often happens in nature, predators and preys belong to different species with different sensory and motor characteristics. <p> values standing for rotation in different directions) and calculating the new x; y position using a set of simple trigonometric equations which gave a maximum estimation error of 0:008mm for the predator and 0:016mm for the prey, absolutely negligible values with respect to the sensor characteristics (for more details, see <ref> [7] </ref>). In line with some of our previous work (e.g., [5]), the robot controller was a simple perceptron of two sigmoid units with recurrent connections at the output layer. The activation of each output unit was used to update the speed value of the corresponding wheel every 100ms. <p> For the first condition, we briefly summarize the basic results already described in a recent paper where we also presented additional analyses and considerations for robotic applications <ref> [7] </ref>. As we shall see below, the changing fitness landscape due to the "Red Queen effect" demands novel measuring techniques to monitor the dynamics of co-evolutionary systems. <p> Finally, the the Scottish tartan pattern of the CIAO graphs, together with the Ancestral Hamming Maps, indicate periods of relative stasis and fast evolutionary changes in both species (a method for picking out best individuals of each species for efficiency and/or fun purposes has been indicated in a previous paper <ref> [7] </ref>). points of evolution. At generation 20 we already have challenging tournaments for both species. The prey has developed a good wall-following and obstacle-avoidance behavior, and the predator displays good pursuit strategies. <p> In a Master Tournament each individual is tested against each best competitor of all generations (see <ref> [7] </ref> for more details) and the resulting average fitness (in this case, over 100 tournaments) of each individual across generations is called Master fitness.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown elsewhere that for geometrically-simple environments one can have small discrepancies between behaviors in simulation and on the real robot by sampling sensor activity at different distances and angles of the robot from the objects of the world (see <ref> [10] </ref> for details). We have thus employed this methodology and sampled infrared sensor activity of each robot in front of a wall and in front of another robot. These values were then separately stored away and accessed through a look-up table depending on the faced object.
