Abstract: Although the design and development of multimedia systems has been the subject of considerable research, few studies (e.g., Beasley & Vila, 1992; Recker & Pirolli, 1991) have examined subjects' navigation patterns and learning in these environments. We describe the design and evaluation of IC-HIP (Schank & Rowe, 1992) a multimedia course on semiconductor manufacturing developed using Hypermedia in PICASSO (HIP; Becker & Rowe, 1990). We asked subjects to browse the course via standard hypermedia links or linear paths, and looked for learning effects based on browsing mode, prior knowledge, and other factors such as subjects' stated interest in semiconductors, kinds of media viewed, and number of course nodes viewed. Results suggest that while low-knowledge subjects learned marginally more new information than high-knowledge subjects, both groups learned at a similar rate (i.e., taking into account how much a subject did not know, as measured by the pre-test). Differences in learning were not correlated with interest, or number or type of nodes viewed. Several interpretations of these results are offered. ICHIP is an introductory multimedia course on integrated circuit (IC, or semiconductor) manufacturing that we (Schank & Rowe, 1992) developed using Hypermedia in PICASSO (HIP; see Figure 1). HIP is a hypermedia extension of the PICASSO graphical user interface environment (Becker & Rowe, 1991). In IC-HIP, segments of information (e.g., images, video clips, textual descriptions) are stored in nodes, and cross-references between information are implemented as links between nodes. In addition to browsing through IC-HIP via these standard hypermedia links 2 , users can follow pre-programmed paths for more linear structured browsing.

Reference-contexts: We then contrasted how subjects learned using these browsing modes. We hypothesized no main effect of environment (the null hypothesis). We also did not anticipate a main effect of prior knowledge, partly because whether either high- or low- knowledge subjects have the advantage is not clear <ref> (e.g., based on Anderson, 1983) </ref>: High-knowledge subjects may have the advantage over low-knowledge subjects, since they have prior, organized, knowledge about semiconductors into which new information may be easily incorporated and old knowledge reaffirmed and skimmed (assuming subjects are basically learning a set of facts and not learning to problem solve).

Reference-contexts: We used hypermedia so we could more easily cross-reference related information (e.g., processstep parameters and pictures showing the desired results of the processing). A common criticism of hypermedia environments is that some learners become overwhelmed by their complexity <ref> (e.g., Smith & Weiss, 1988) </ref>. However, studies suggest that some students learn better in hypermedia environments, while others learn better in linear ones (e.g., Recker & Pirolli, 1992; cf. Reiser, Cohen, Ranney, Hamid, & Kimberg, in preparation).
