Abstract: Biological control systems have long been studied as possible inspiration for the construction of robotic controllers. The cerebellum is known to be involved in the production and learning of smooth, coordinated movements. In this paper, we present a model of cerebellar control of a muscle-actuated, two-link, planar arm. The model learns in a trial-and-error fashion to generate the appropriate sequence of motor signals that accurately bring the arm to a specified target. The motor signals produced by the cerebellum are specified in muscle synergy space. When the cerebellum fails to bring the arm to the target, an extra-cerebellar module performs low-quality corrective movements, from which the cerebellum updates its program. In learning to perform the task, the cerebellum constructs an implicit inverse model of the plant. This model uses a combination of delayed sensory signals and recently-generated motor commands to compute the new output motor signal.

Reference-contexts: These fibers impinge on granule cells, whose axons give rise to parallel fibers (PFs). Through the combination of inputs from multiple classes of MFs and local inhibitory interneurons, the granule cells are thought to provide a sparse, expansive encoding of the incoming state information <ref> [1] </ref>. In our model, such an encoding is computed by the state encoder (Figure 1) using a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) [1, 15]. This coding scheme makes use of multiple tilings over the state space. <p> In our model, such an encoding is computed by the state encoder (Figure 1) using a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. This coding scheme makes use of multiple tilings over the state space. A single tiling partitions the space defined by several state variables (e.g. e , _ e , and ^u 1 ) into discrete, non-overlapping rectangular volumes (tiles). <p> When the system state falls into a particular tile, the tile is given an activation level of 1, and all others within the tiling are set to 0. Like Albus, we imagine that each tile corresponds to a single granule cell <ref> [1] </ref>. Due to the large number of state variables, it is impractical for a single tiling to effectively partition the entire space. Thus, a number of tilings are used in parallel, each making use of different subsets of state variables.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the CFs are differentially responsive to the direction of limb movement. During active movements (such as stepping), some CF responses are inhibited, except at the very end of movement, where certain perturbations are likely to occur (e.g. due to misanticipation of the height of the step) <ref> [2] </ref>. In the model, CFs deliver error information to the cerebellum's APGs (there is exactly one CF for each APG). The CF behavior draws in two key ways from the behavior observed in cat.

Reference-contexts: A single muscle behaves as a non-linear visco-elastic (spring) element. Control of the arm is achieved by setting the rest length of each muscle. The learning controller (the cerebellar module) is constructed from an array of adjustable pattern generators (APGs) <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, each of which drives a single muscle synergy. These APGs combine the current target position with delayed sensory and motor efference signals to produce motor commands that are intended to bring the arm to the specified goal.

Thus, CF signals only deviate from their background firing rate when corrective movements are initiated. Second, the increase (or decrease) in CF firing probability is a function of the rate of stretch of the muscles.

Reference-contexts: Hence, individual muscle synergies approximately encode movements in a cylindrical coordinate system. 2.2 Cerebellar Module In the brain, mossy fibers (MFs) carry plant state, motor efference, and other contextual signals into the cerebellum <ref> [5] </ref>. These fibers impinge on granule cells, whose axons give rise to parallel fibers (PFs).

Reference-contexts: The primate cerebellum is known to be involved in the learning and production of coordinated movements [18].

This model does not rely on a high-quality, built-in model of the plant, but rather acquires an implicit model through experience. The work is extended in this paper in two key directions. First, control signals generated by the learning controller are in a muscle synergy space.

Reference-contexts: These APGs combine the current target position with delayed sensory and motor efference signals to produce motor commands that are intended to bring the arm to the specified goal. In cases where (Figure adapted from <ref> [11] </ref>). the arm does not reach this goal, the static EC module is activated.

Second, our model does not make use of reference trajectories, as has been assumed in other models of cerebellar control <ref> [11, 16] </ref>. More specifically, there is little physiological evidence to support the idea that another subsystem provides to the cerebellum a detailed kinematic plan a plan which happens to satisfy certain dynamic optimality criteria. <p> Rather, we would like to integrate other forms of feedback, such that the cerebellar module is constrained in the types of trajectories that it learns to generate (this issue has been addressed by others <ref> [11, 16] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This trace acts as a memory of recent synaptic activity. The memory marks the synapse as being eligible for potential update in the event that later training inputs arrive from the IO. In our model, we make use of a second-order eligibility trace ( e ij ) <ref> [12, 16] </ref>, whose time-course is shown in Figure 6. This form of eligibility trace has the advantage that the memory of PF activation is temporally blurred over a long period of time.

Reference-contexts: Second, the time between the activation of a PF and the generation of a corrective movement (which gives rise to CF signals) can vary by several hundred milliseconds. We address these problems through the use of an eligibility trace on the synapse <ref> [13, 17] </ref>. This trace acts as a memory of recent synaptic activity.

Reference-contexts: An individual muscle synergy activates a collection of the available muscles in a coordinated fashion. This language of motor outputs is more akin to what is available to motor areas of the brain, including the cerebellum <ref> [14] </ref>. Second, we introduce a simple, visual-based extra-cerebellar (EC) controller for producing corrective movements. When the learning cerebellar controller is unable to bring the arm to the specified target, the EC controller produces a short burst of muscle activity that moves the arm closer to the target. <p> This module produces a short, constant burst of activity in muscle synergy space that brings the arm closer to the goal. The contributions of the two control modules are combined in the spinal/muscle system, which transforms muscle synergy signals into joint torques. Each muscle synergy <ref> [14] </ref> activates a subset of muscles. Motor commands for opposing muscles then reciprocally inhibit one-another (S). Finally, multiple muscles induce torques about individual joints, as described by transform A. Errors in cerebellar-generated movements are assessed by the inferior olive (IO), and are measured in muscle synergy space. <p> Instead, an individual cell often projects to a group of related muscles <ref> [14] </ref>. This makes the learning-to-control problem more difficult. Not only must the system decide which muscles to activate to move the limb appropriately, but it must also recruit the right combination of muscle synergies to achieve the desired muscle activation.
