Title: Teaching Hypertext and Hypermedia through the Web  
Author: Paul M. E. De Bra 
Address: PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven The Netherlands  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics and Computing Science Eindhoven University of Technology  
Abstract: Since early 1994 the introductory course 2L670, Hypermedia Structures and Systems, has been available on World Wide Web, and is an optional part of the curriculum in computing science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The course has since been completed by more than 200 students from three different universities, two in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. Since January 1st 1996 the course is also offered at two more Dutch universities and at the Dutch Open University. In order to participate in this course the student only needs a World Wide Web browser. There is no need for separate e-mail, netnews, bulletin boards or ftp software. In this paper we present the technical environment for the current (1996) edition of the course, which features automatic evaluation of small assignments, a repository for assignment work, a discussion system, and complete monitoring of each student's progress. We also reflect on the previous architecture, used for the first 200 students, and draw lessons from that experience.

Reference-contexts: This Document Repository Service Station makes it possible to upload documents or even complete directories to the department's Web server by means of a form that is part of the course text. DReSS is similar to the well known BSCW system <ref> [Bentley et al. 95] </ref>. (BSCW stands for Basic Support for Collaborative Work.) DReSS is much simpler than BSCW. It only provides upload and modification facilities, with full authorization facilities, but no version control or workspace overviews. Some newer browsers support file upload.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In the spring of 1993 the Department of Computing Science of the Eindhoven University of Technology agreed to add an optional course on hypertext and hypermedia to the curriculum <ref> [De Bra 94] </ref>. In order to give the students some hands-on experience with hypertext while studying this course we decided to offer the course text in hypertext form, using World Wide Web technology.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, many students fail to set the file permissions right so the teacher can access their work while their fellow students cannot. (Many students block access to everyone, including the teacher.) For both the smaller assignments and the final project, the DReSS system can now be used <ref> [De Bra & Aerts 95] </ref>. This Document Repository Service Station makes it possible to upload documents or even complete directories to the department's Web server by means of a form that is part of the course text.

Reference-contexts: A discussion platform enables them to exchange ideas and remarks on the course. Instead of using a mailing list, which would require the students to get acquainted with e-mail, and mailing list archives, we have selected the WWW-based Futplex system <ref> [Holtman 95] </ref>, developed at the Eindhoven University. Futplex has been used in several projects and Web sites already, including the Digital City of Amsterdam. Futplex lets students talk publicly by posting messages and replying to others' messages, and they can create new pages, representing new lines of discussion.
