Abstract: Virtual Trees are source-rooted trees in ATM networks in which VCs originating at the source but going to different destinations can share some of the bandwidth pre-allocated to the VT, thus providing an additional multiplexing advantage over Virtual Paths. Non-ATM protocols such as MIL-STD-188-220A can also take advantage of Virtual Trees because source concatenation provides a benefit very similar to ATM multiplexing. We describe the results of a simulation study which shows that Virtual Tree configurations have almost 40% lower cost than corresponding Virtual Path configurations. Applications of this work to dynamic routing schemes for battlefield wireless networks are outlined.

Reference-contexts: for Virtual Channels (VCs) and to simplify setting up of VCs in response to connection requests The VP concept provides several advantages such as allowing simpler network architectures, eliminating the need for call-by-call routing resulting in very short connection setup times, and allowing easier implementation of dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes <ref> [1] </ref>. In our previous work, we have extended this concept of Virtual Paths to propose a new technique called Virtual Trees (VTs) that can be used for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks [2], [3].

Reference-contexts: Battlefield wireless networks can exploit the advantages of Virtual Trees because of source concatenation at the data link and physical layers which has an effect very similar to that of VC multiplexing in ATM networks. For instance, the MIL-STD-188-220A protocol <ref> [4] </ref> uses source concatenation at both the data link and physical layers. Paths to various destinations that have been set up in the form of a VT are better able to take advantage of source concatenation than paths that do not use a tree structure. <p> However, there are similar advantages in wireless networks of using source concatenation of packets flowing to different destinations. The MIL-STD-188-220A protocol suite <ref> [4] </ref> being developed for Combat Net Radio (CNR) for digitized battlefields uses source concatenation at both the data link and physical layers.

Reference-contexts: This takes the form of a tree rooted at the source node whence the name Virtual Tree. In a VP, different VCs may share the bandwidth of the VP resulting in better multiplexing of the traffic than if the network allocated bandwidth individually for each VC <ref> [5] </ref>. However, multiplexing in VPs is limited to traffic flowing between the same source-destination pair. In Virtual Trees, the multiplexing effect of VPs is enhanced by permitting sharing of bandwidth among traffic flowing to different destinations although it is still limited to traffic originating at a single source.

Reference-contexts: Finding such configurations that are optimal (minimize total network cost) is an NP-Hard problem <ref> [6] </ref>. We have developed two approximate optimization algorithms for finding VT and VP configurations that, while not yielding an optimal solution, provide good solutions in a reasonable amount of time [7].

We have developed two approximate optimization algorithms for finding VT and VP configurations that, while not yielding an optimal solution, provide good solutions in a reasonable amount of time <ref> [7] </ref>. The two algorithms named Graph Reduction and Underloaded Neighbors both start with shortest path configurations and modify them in different ways to try and satisfy link capacity constraints. <p> Both algorithms start by constructing Unconstrained paths in which link capacities are not taken into account during the process of bandwidth allocation, but then differ in the way in which link capacity constraints are used to modify the paths. A description of the algorithms is available in <ref> [7] </ref> and is omitted here for reasons of space; instead, we present the results of a simulation study comparing the performance of the algorithms on VTs and VPs with that of the unconstrained algorithm. We simulated the unconstrained and the two con 2 Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: This again represents a 40% improvement for VTs over VPs. APPLICATION TO WIRELESS BATTLEFIELD NETWORKS Recently, Virtual Trees have been proposed to be used in two different contexts in wireless networks for managing handoff between mobile terminals and base stations. Acampora and Naghshineh <ref> [8] </ref> use a tree called a Virtual Connection Tree to modify existing VCs when a mobile node is handed off to a new base station.

Reference-contexts: However, their tree is not rooted at the source like our tree is and also uses distinct paths from the root to the base stations, thus not taking advantage of multiplexing over overlapping links. Veeraraghavan et al. <ref> [9] </ref> use a Virtual Sink Tree to find paths to a given destination. A Sink Tree is rooted at the destination instead of the source, and takes advantage of multiplexing over common links, but VCI setup is slower.
