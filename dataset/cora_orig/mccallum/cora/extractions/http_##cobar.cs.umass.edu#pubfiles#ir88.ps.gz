Abstract: It has been known that different representations of a query retrieve different sets of documents. Recent work suggests that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved by combining multiple representations of an information need. However, little effort has been made to understand the reason why combining multiple sources of evidence improves retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we analyze why improvements can be achieved with evidence combination, and investigate how evidence should be combined. We describe a rationale for multiple evidence combination, and propose a combining method whose properties coincide with the rationale. We also investigate the effect of using rank instead of similarity on retrieval effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: They implemented the INQUERY retrieval system based on the model, and demonstrated that multiple evidence increases retrieval effectiveness in some circumstances. Fox & Shaw [3] have worked on various methods for combining multiple retrieval runs, and have obtained improvements over any single retrieval run. Belkin, et al. <ref> [1] </ref> showed that progressive combination of different Boolean query formulations could lead to progressive improvements of retrieval effectiveness. <p> In this paper we provide experimental results supporting that data fusion improves retrieval effectiveness, but the primary aim of our study is to understand why improvements can be achieved by multiple evidence combination, and also to investigate how evidence should be combined. Belkin, et al. <ref> [1] </ref> argued that different runs retrieve different sets of relevant documents and also retrieve different sets of nonrelevant documents. We analyze research results obtained in the data fusion literature, and give a new rationale for evidence combination that is a little different from the previous one. <p> Section 4 describes the effect of using rank instead of similarity on retrieval effectiveness. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5. 2 Rationales for Multiple Evidence Combination Belkin, et al. <ref> [1] </ref> combined different Boolean query formulations, and showed that the combination could lead to improvements of retrieval effectiveness. They also gave a rationale for data fusion, which is quoted below.

Reference-contexts: As shown in the table, the summation function, which sums up the set of similarity values, works better in the TREC subcollections such as AP-1, WSJ-1, AP-2 and WSJ-2 <ref> [2] </ref>. Our analyses suggested that the more runs a document is retrieved by, the higher the rank that combining functions should assign to the document.

Reference-contexts: They implemented the INQUERY retrieval system based on the model, and demonstrated that multiple evidence increases retrieval effectiveness in some circumstances. Fox & Shaw <ref> [3] </ref> have worked on various methods for combining multiple retrieval runs, and have obtained improvements over any single retrieval run. Belkin, et al. [1] showed that progressive combination of different Boolean query formulations could lead to progressive improvements of retrieval effectiveness. <p> Hence, in order to align both the lower bounds of similarity values and the upper, we normalize each similarity value by the maximum and minimum actually seen in a retrieval result as follows: normalized similarity = unnormalized similarity minimum similarity maximum similarity minimum similarity Fox & Shaw <ref> [3] </ref> tested several functions for combining multiple evidence, namely CombMIN, CombMAX, CombSUM, CombANZ and CombMNZ, which are shown in Table 3. They performed five different retrieval runs, and combined the retrieval results. Two types of queries were used, P -norm extended Boolean queries [7] and natural language vector queries.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, however, we will investigate retrieval results produced by quite different retrieval systems rather than one retrieval system. Many systems participate in the TREC conference <ref> [4] </ref>, in which the systems retrieve top-ranked documents for the given document and query sets. Since the top-ranked documents are generated using the same document and query sets, combining the different results can be considered a kind of data fusion.

Reference-contexts: Second, Katzer, et al. <ref> [5] </ref> considered the effect of different document representations (e.g., title, abstract) on retrieval effectiveness rather than different query representations. They discovered that the various document representations gave similar retrieval effectiveness, but retrieved quite different sets of documents.

Reference-contexts: Fox & Shaw [3] have worked on various methods for combining multiple retrieval runs, and have obtained improvements over any single retrieval run. Belkin, et al. [1] showed that progressive combination of different Boolean query formulations could lead to progressive improvements of retrieval effectiveness. Lee <ref> [6] </ref> described how different properties of weighting schemes may retrieve different types of documents, and showed that significant improvements could be obtained by combining the retrieval results from weighting schemes with different properties.

Reference-contexts: They performed five different retrieval runs, and combined the retrieval results. Two types of queries were used, P -norm extended Boolean queries <ref> [7] </ref> and natural language vector queries. A single set of P -norm queries was created, but it was interpreted multiple times with different operator weights (P -values) of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0; these three runs are designated P n1:0, P n1:5, and P n2:0.

Reference-contexts: Different representations of the same query, or of the documents in the database, or different retrieval techniques for the same query, retrieve different sets of documents (both relevant and nonrelevant). The above rationale derives from two earlier research results as follows: First, McGill, Koll & Norreault <ref> [8] </ref> found that there was surprisingly little overlap between document sets for the same information need when documents were retrieved by different users or by the same user using controlled versus free-text vocabularies.

Reference-contexts: The above analysis suggests that improvements could be achieved by combining two different runs even if they retrieve similar sets of documents, and should lead to a modification of the rationale given by Belkin, et al. Saracevic & Kantor <ref> [9] </ref> asked different experts to construct Boolean queries based on the same description of an information problem in operational online information retrieval systems. Like McGill, Koll & Norreault and Katzer, et al., they found that different query formulations generated different documents.

Reference-contexts: This general area has been discussed in the literature under the name of "data fusion". Turtle & Croft <ref> [10] </ref> developed an inference network-based retrieval model, which can combine different document representations and different versions of a query in a consistent probabilistic framework. They implemented the INQUERY retrieval system based on the model, and demonstrated that multiple evidence increases retrieval effectiveness in some circumstances. <p> They discovered that the various document representations gave similar retrieval effectiveness, but retrieved quite different sets of documents. Other research results suggest that this rationale for multiple evidence combination should be investigated in more detail. Turtle & Croft <ref> [10] </ref> evaluated both probabilistic and Boolean versions of queries, and combined the results. Combining queries resulted in significant performance improvements for the CACM and CISI collections. They also gave an interesting analysis, which is quoted below.
