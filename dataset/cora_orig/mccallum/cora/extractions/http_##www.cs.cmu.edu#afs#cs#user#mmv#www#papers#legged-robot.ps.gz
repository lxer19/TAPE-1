Abstract: Sony has provided a remarkable platform for research and development in robotic agents, namely fully autonomous legged robots. In this paper, we describe our work using Sony's legged robots to participate at the RoboCup'98 legged robot demonstration and competition. Robotic soccer represents a very challenging environment for research into systems with multiple robots that need to achieve concrete objectives, particularly in the presence of an adversary. Furthermore RoboCup'98 offers an excellent opportunity for robot entertainment. We introduce the RoboCup context and briefly present Sony's legged robot. We developed a vision-based navigation and a Bayesian localization algorithm. Team strategy is achieved through pre-defined behaviors and learning by instruction.

Reference-contexts: From a viewpoint of sensor-motor learning and development, multi sensory information and multi DOFs control should be established simultaneously, that is, affecting each other, the sensory information is abstracted and the multi joint motions are well coordinated at the same time <ref> [1] </ref>. However, it seems very difficult for artificial systems to develop both together. Our goal is to design such a method.

Reference-contexts: The effects of movement actions are highly noisy and modeling them accurately did not seem feasible to us. However, to compensate to the highly unreliable dead reckoning, the field environment for RoboCup'98 includes several fixed colored landmarks. Therefore, at Carnegie Mel-lon, we developed a Bayesian localization procedure (e.g., <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. As the robot cannot keep enough markers in view at all times to calculate its location directly, our algorithm uses a probabilistic method of localization using triangulation based on two landmarks. The field is discretized in grid locations. The continuous robot head angles are also discretized.

We solved these problem by actually manufacturing a dedicated camera and a processor chip <ref> [8] </ref>. 4 Vision-Based Navigation Each legged robot for RoboCup'98 is equipped with a single perception sensor, namely a vision camera. The hardware-based vision processor provides a robust eight-color discrimination. Robots need to act solely in response to the visual input perceived.

Reference-contexts: Our localization algorithm is invoked actively, i.e., the robot searches for two landmarks when the maximum state probability is below a pre-defined threshold. In our experiments, the robots localize themselves with high accuracy. 4.3 Role-Based Behaviors Following up on our experience with the small-size RoboCup wheeled robots <ref> [11, 12] </ref>, we developed different behaviors based on positioning on the field. As of now, robots play two different roles, namely attacking and goal keeping.
