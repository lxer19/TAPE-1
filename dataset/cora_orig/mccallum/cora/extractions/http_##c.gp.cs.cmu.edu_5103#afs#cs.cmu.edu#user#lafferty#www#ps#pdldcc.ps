Title: Probabilistic Decoding of Low-Density Cayley Codes  
Author: Adam L. Berger John D. Lafferty 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: We report on some investigations into the behavior of a class of low-density codes constructed using algebraic techniques. Recent work shows expansion to be an essential property of the graphs underlying the low-density parity-check codes first introduced by Gallager. In addition, it has recently been shown that certain spectral techniques similar to those based on Fourier analysis for classical cyclic codes can be applied to codes constructed from Cayley graphs. This motivates us to compare the behavior of algebraically constructed expanders and randomly generated bipartite graphs using a probabilistic decoding algorithm. Preliminary results indicate that the performance of the explicit, algebraic expanders is comparable to that of random graphs in the case where each variable is associated with only two parity checks, while such codes are inferior to randomly generated codes with three or more constraints for each variable.

Reference-contexts: The end points of e and f are swapped to construct (i+1) n;k if such a move would not create a multiedge, otherwise the graph remains unchanged. Thus, the graphs (i) (i+1) fer by at most a 4-cycle. This procedure is known to be rapidly mixing <ref> [3] </ref>. As a practical consideration, however, in our experiments we simply performed 10 8 swaps, which required roughly an hour on a DEC Alpha workstation for each graph that was generated.

As Figure 2 demonstrates (and as Gallager's analysis predicts), such codes are inferior to those obtained with three or more constraints for each variable. As discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>, associating variables with paths of length k 2 generalizes the edge-vertex construction to yield (c; d)-regular expander graphs. However, this construction should not be expected to yield useful codes, since large subsets of the variables will share several constraints in common.
