Reference-contexts: Fairness must be provided for asynchronous traffic sources. This paper presents the MAC scheme designed to support synchronous traffic within the AMNET LAN. The MAC scheme for asynchronous traffic is detailed in <ref> [3] </ref>. AMNET provides two cell types for carrying synchronous traffic. Support for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint synchronous traffic is provided via synchronous cells, which devote all 48 bytes of data to the one VC. <p> In addition, VCs may span the controller issuing the cells and require two slot revolutions for pickup and delivery. This may cause starvation of lower priority traffic sources which are delivered end-to-end. A more complete explanation of this phenomenon is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The table reservation mechanism allows synchronous VCs, with possibly overlapping topography, alternating use of the ring.

Reference-contexts: Ethernet is not suitable for applications involving synchronous traffic due to its inability to guarantee delays in accessing the medium.The contention based Ethernet MAC protocol, i.e. CSMA/CD, does not provide a bounded access delay, or support a reservationist model <ref> [4] </ref>. Research into a modification of CSMA/CD to provide bounded delays for voice related synchronous traffic is reported in [5]. The highest priority of data in FDDI-II [6] is directed towards support of 8KHz sampled telephony. Up to sixteen 6.144Mbps, full duplex channels may be allocated.

Reference-contexts: In AMNET a full-duplex channel between just two nodes is more efficiently handled by using two simplex, synchronous, VCs. Schemes for allocating synchronous bandwidth using FDDI's timed token rotation protocol, e.g. for transmission of video data, are explored in <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The normalized proportional allocation scheme proposed in [7] guarantees up to 33% of available bandwidth to synchronous traffic. <p> In AMNET a full-duplex channel between just two nodes is more efficiently handled by using two simplex, synchronous, VCs.

Reference-contexts: Reference [8] proposes another allocation scheme for synchronous traffic and shows that in the case of a set of N identical real-time channels, an FDDI network can use at most half of its bandwidth for these channels. An extension of this work in <ref> [9] </ref> indicates that a modification to the FDDI MAC protocol, called FDDI-M by the author, may significantly improve FDDI's ability to support synchronous traffic in the best case, i.e. allocation of up to 100% of the available bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: A discussion of the difficulties involved in allocating bandwidth to high priority variable bit rate traffic in DQDB, and a proposed solution to the problem may be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. AMNET provides a more flexible scheme than any of the existing standards. By allocating bandwidth from a table, fine control of bandwidth allocation and traffic shape can be exercised. The latter should prove beneficial when the project moves to the internetworking stage.

Reference-contexts: The AMNET Audio Subsystem is designed to support a conference call involving up to eight stereo audio sources. The audio sampling rate is 32KHz and the sample length 16 bits. The sample rate and length conform to the recommendations for transmission related applications in <ref> [14] </ref>. There is an additional overhead of eight bits for each sample, for experimentation and for the construction of a personalised sound mix at each node. Therefore each shared synchronous cell contains sixteen 16 bit samples with 8 bits of overhead each, i.e. eight stereo channels.
