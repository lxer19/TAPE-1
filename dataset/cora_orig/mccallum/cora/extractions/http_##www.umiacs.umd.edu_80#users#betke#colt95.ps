Abstract: We study how a mobile robot can piecemeal learn an unknown environment. The robot's goal is to learn a complete map of its environment, while satisfying the constraint that it must return every so often to its starting position (for refueling, say). The environment is modelled as an arbitrary, undirected graph, which is initially unknown to the robot. We assume that the robot can distinguish vertices and edges that it has already explored. We present a surprisingly efficient algorithm for piecemeal learning an unknown undirected graph G = (V; E) in which the robot explores every vertex and edge in the graph by traversing at most O(E + V 1+o(1) ) edges. This nearly linear algorithm improves on the best previous algorithm, in which the robot traverses at most O(E + V 2 ) edges. We also give an application of piecemeal learning to the problem of searching a graph for a "treasure". fl We gratefully acknowledge support from NSF grant CCR-9310888, ARO grant DAAL03-86-K-0171, NSF grant 9217041-ASC, Air Force Contract TNDGAFOSR-86-0078, ARPA/Army contract DABT63-93-C-0038, NSF contract 9114440-CCR, DARPA contract N00014-J-92-1799, ARPA/ONR contract N00014-92-J-1310, the Siemens Corporation, and a special grant from IBM.

Reference-contexts: More formal theoretical approaches to these problems have also been studied extensively (e.g., [20, 10, 22, 5]). We study the problem of piecemeal learning of an unknown environment <ref> [8] </ref>. The robot's goal is to learn a complete map of its environment while satisfying the piecemeal constraint that learning must be done "a piece at a time," with the robot returning to the starting point s after each learning phase. <p> At the start position s, the robot can cool off, recharge, or drop off samples collected. Approaches to modelling a robot's environment come from graph theory, computational geometry, on-line algorithms, and the theory of finite automata. The model used here was introduced by Betke, Rivest, and Singh <ref> [8] </ref>. The robot's task is to learn an unknown environment modelled as an undirected graph G = (V; E) in a piecemeal manner. The robot's efficiency (or running time) is measured in terms of the number of edges traversed. <p> A robot can explore grid-graphs with rectangular obstacles in a piecemeal manner in linear time, if the robot is given a bound on the number of edges it may traverse in each learning phase (Betke, Rivest, and Singh <ref> [8] </ref>). We extend these results to show that the robot can learn any undirected graph piecemeal in almost linear time. It is open whether arbitrary, undirected graphs can be learned piecemeal in linear time. <p> The proof of this theorem is similar to one shown by Betke, Rivest, and Singh in a previous paper <ref> [8] </ref>. All the algorithms we present in this paper are efficiently interruptible, and thus give efficient piecemeal learning algorithms for undirected graphs.
