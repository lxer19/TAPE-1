Abstract: n this assignment you are required to implement an information management system n for handling data similar to that used in VLSI (very large scale integration) applications. I uch an environment the primary entities are small rectangles and the problem in which we are - interested is how to manage a large collection of them. In the following we trace the develop ent of a variant of the quadtree data structure that has been found to be useful for such a - problem. Your task is to implement this data structure in such a way that a number of opera
