Title: Mechanisms for Implementation of a Distributed Prolog System  
Author: by Leland Morrison 
Pubnum: CSC499  
Abstract: A search for readily available ways in which to construct an implementation of Prolog which would use multiple processors to perform tasks in parallel was carried out. Our goal for the system was to have at least three CPUs working together in a non-pipeline type of parallelism.

Reference-contexts: Data structures are well supported, and lists are (almost) trivial. Recursiveness is an integral part of the 2 language. Some flavors of sorts were considered as possible benchmarks to take advantage of the recursiveness and study the efficiency. Finally, parallel versions of Prolog already exist. SICStus Prolog 3 <ref> [1] </ref> is a commercially available implementation which supports both explicit message passing and implicit "OR-parallelism" (currently available only on some multi-processor systems). This implementation "largely conforms" to the ISO Prolog Standard [2 & 3] according to their web site. 2.

The special support for Prolog is represented by the existence of operands which provide backtracking support for the standard way to execute a Prolog program.
