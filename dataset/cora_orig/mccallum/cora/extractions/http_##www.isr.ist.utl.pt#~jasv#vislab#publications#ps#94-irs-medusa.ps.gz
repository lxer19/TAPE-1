Abstract: This paper describes the design and control of a stereo head system Medusa, with four mechanic degrees of freedom, (independent vergence, tilt and pan), which was designed for active vision applications. The main mechanic design specifications were met by suitably selecting the motors and carefully estimating the moments of inertia of the structure. The control problem was split into an inner servo loop and an outer gaze control loop. The servo loop has been carefully modeled and suitable controllers were designed both for velocity and position control. Even though the visual loop is still kept to a simple level, many interesting tracking tasks can be addressed. For a single eye configuration, a test example is presented in which the tracking behaviour can be seen.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computer vision systems have traditionally been designed without paying much attention to the observer role (camera motion, stereo rig geometry, lens parameters, etc) in the perceptual process. In the last few years, however, researchers have recovered the idea of the active observer and active vision <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>, mostly inspired by studies in psychophysics, psychology and biology [6, 9]. Within this new framework, the active involvement of the observer in the perception task, by changing the general characteristics of the visual system, became an obvious advantage to improve perception.

Reference-contexts: The camera/eyes of a stereo rig can verge to maintain a fixation point on an interesting object; the cameras can then foveate the object, bringing it to the image center and zooming in, and so on <ref> [5, 7, 8, 10, 11] </ref>. A key issue for all these problems is the sensorimotor coordination or, in the particular case of computer vision, visuo-motor coordination. Instead of performing exhaustive and heavy calculations for scene reconstruction, "simple" image measurements are directly used as visual feedback for motor control.
