Abstract: diadem is a software system for real-time operations management. Operations management systems perform such important on-line functions as configuration, fault, performance and resource management in large scale, supervisory and embedded application environments. Operations management systems must contend with the practical reality of installed systems, varying levels of instrumentation, automation and integration, role of the human operator and constantly increasing demand for automation and integration. To address these diverse and complicated requirements, diadem integrates three key technologies: information technology, networking technology and systems technology. At its core, diadem consists of a sophisticated real-time event scheduling algorithm. diadem supports both synchronous events and asynchronous events. diadem-based applications have a dynamic, scaleable and flexible system architecture for distributed multi-agent operation. diadem's underlying model is a dynamic network of multi-rate hybrid automata with the following innovations: object-orientation, auxiliary states, classification of transitions into proactions, reactions and responses and dynamically changing data and event propagation dependencies between components.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it provides integrated graphical tools for modeling the application. diadem is not a framework for simulation, analysis, synthesis or verification. However, the diadem modeling environment provides interfaces to related tools such as kronos <ref> [2] </ref>. At its core, diadem consists of a sophisticated real-time event scheduling algorithm. diadem supports both synchronous events (known simply as Events) and asynchronous events (known as Alerts). Events and alerts are information packets modeled using object-oriented data modeling. <p> However, being a control system, diadem places certain restrictions for high-fidelity real-time operation. With a few more restrictions, the application can be analyzed, verified or synthesized using suitable tools such as cospan [15], kronos <ref> [2] </ref> or HyTech [16]. diadem's model has been carefully designed to enable such linkage of tools. There are two main approaches to real-time control system design: task scheduling and event scheduling. In task scheduling, the application consists of a (typically small) collection of sequential tasks with points of potential synchronization.

Reference-contexts: The data and process modeling formalisms embodied in a software system are significantly influenced by the purpose of the system. Models for simulation, control, analysis, verification and synthesis typically form a nested hierarchy going from the most to the least expressive. diadem's model has been influenced by the SHIFT <ref> [14] </ref> programming language system for hybrid systems 3 simulation. However, being a control system, diadem places certain restrictions for high-fidelity real-time operation. <p> Using diadem's performance data, the application models can be tuned to obtain suitable real-time performance. 2 The DIADEM Model For those readers who are experts in the field of data and process modeling, diadem's model can be quickly summarized as follows. The underlying model is a dynamic network <ref> [14] </ref> of multi-rate hybrid automata [17] with the following innovations: object-orientation [5, 6, 4, 7], auxiliary states, classification of transitions into proactions, reactions and responses and dynamically changing data and event propagation dependencies between components. 2.1 Server Model The behavior of server processes is governed by the application models in the
