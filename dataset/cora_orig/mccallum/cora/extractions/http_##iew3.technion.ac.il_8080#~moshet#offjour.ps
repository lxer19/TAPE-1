Abstract: We are concerned with the utility of social laws in a computational environment, laws which guarantee the successful coexistence of multiple programs and programmers. In this paper we are interested in the off line design of social laws, where we as designers must decide ahead of time on useful social laws. In the first part of this paper we suggest the use of social laws in the domain of mobile robots, and prove analytic results about the usefulness of this approach in that setting. In the second part of this paper we present a general model of social law in a computational system, and investigate some of its properties. This includes a definition of the basic computational problem involved with the design of multi-agent systems, and an investigation of the automatic synthesis of useful social laws in the framework of a model which refers explicitly to social laws.

Reference-contexts: Some work had been concerned with issues related to topics discussed in this paper. This includes work in the areas of organization theory (see [8]), team theory ([9]), and DAI (see for example <ref> [4] </ref>). The related work in these areas of research is especially concerned with the design of agents' roles and communication structures which enable a cooperative achievement of a common goal.

Reference-contexts: Much remains to be done. For example, as was mentioned in section 2.1, 11 To quote from Ramadge and Wonham's survey article <ref> [13] </ref>, "... we assumed that the components of the open loop product system were independent, and that any interaction between the components could be modeled as part of a control constraint". 26 we have assumed a homogeneous society, both in term of the makeup of agents and in terms of the

Reference-contexts: In such cases, can we devise methods by which, through trial and error, the agents will over time converge on a social law? These are some of the questions in which we are currently interested; experimental results on these matters appear in <ref> [15] </ref>. 27 Appendix: Proof sketches Proof of Theorem 3.1 (sketch): It is easy to check that the problem is in NP. We prove NP-hardness by a reduction from 3-SAT. Clause i in the 3-SAT instance will correspond to transitions which change from state i to state i + 1.
