A quantitative measure of password strength and `lasting' power is developed. Five password encryption techniques are discussed and compared using several criteria. Finally, ten authentication guidelines are presented. </title>

A list of recommended techniques for password selection is provided. Passwords and methods crackers have used to break into systems as well as security guidelines for system managers are also discussed. </title> <type> 1 </type>

Eugene Schultz, Jr. </author> <title> A framework for password selection. </title> <type> Technical Report UCRL-99382, </type> <institution> Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, </institution> <year> 1988. </year> <title> This paper describes a study on the guessability of passwords. Both easy and difficult passwords were guessed at by subjects, some of which were given cues as to the makeup of the password. The results suggest that only easy passwords with known characteristics are readily guessable. The author concludes that users may select their own passwords securely if they follow guidelines that will make them difficult to guess. </title>

The first improvement prevents eavesdropping on communications through the use of public-key cryptography. The author proposes a protocol for secure communication. The second improvement is an algorithm allowing the use of long password phrases, which prevent the success of exhaustive password searches. </title>
