Abstract: To extract a set of suitable features from all Chinese characters for the purpose of classification is essential in the design of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for printed Chinese characters. Moment descriptors have been developed as features in pattern recognition since the moment method was first introduced. The moment method is different from other feature extraction methods used in Chinese character recognition, in that, moments can be carefully selected such that the extracted features are invariant under translation, scale change, and rotation. The moment method captures global properties of characters rather than local ones. In this paper, new moment features for Chinese character recognition are proposed which provide significant improvements in terms of Chinese character recognition, especially for those characters that are very close in shapes.

Reference-contexts: The moments in the sets fM p0 g and fM 0p g are equivalent to the moments of the image projection onto the x axis and y axis, respectively. Describing an image with moments means that global properties of the image are used rather than local ones. Hu <ref> [7] </ref> first demonstrated the utility of moment features through a simple pattern recognition experiment. The first two moment invariants, (10) and (11) were used to represent several known digitized patterns in a two-dimensional feature space.

Reference-contexts: The uniqueness nature of moments makes this method a proper candidate in Chinese character recognition. For a digital image, the double integrations of M pq in (3) are usually approximated by double summations <ref> [10] </ref> M pq = i=1 j=1 where h M pq (x i ; y j ) = 2 2 2 2 x p y q dxdy (5) represents the double integration of x p y q over the pixel [x i x 2 ; x i + x y y x <p> the double integration of (18) can be approximated by double summation: mn = 4 i=1 j=1 where h mn (x i ; y j ) = 2 2 2 2 P m (x)P n (y)dxdy: (20) 6 With the Legendre moments, the characters can be reconstructed from the extracted features <ref> [10] </ref>. This property ensures that complete information about the character shape is presented in the extracted features, and hopefully, these features have high power in terms of classification. 3 Character Recognition via Moments The lower order geometric moments represent some well known fundamental properties of the underlying image function.

Reference-contexts: But, these methods mostly take local features of the characters into account only, making the recognition of Chinese characters that are very close in shapes very difficult. Moment descriptors of various forms have been developed following Hu [7][8] as the extracted features of an image in pattern recognition <ref> [15] </ref>. Describing an image with moments instead of other traditional methods of image processing means that global 2 properties of the image are used rather than local ones.

Reference-contexts: However, existing systems often fail to recognize Chinese characters that are very close in shapes. The main problems with OCR for Printed Chinese Characters (OCRPCC) are three folds <ref> [17] </ref>. The first problem is due to the large set of characters 1 that an OCRPCC must recognize. The smallest set of Chinese characters was defined in China's national standard GB2312 with 6,763 characters, which is two magnitude larger than any OCR system for Western languages.

Reference-contexts: However, many Chinese characters that are different in meanings have very similar shapes thus making classification very difficult. In our experiments, we picked a set of Chinese character pairs that often have difficulty in recognition <ref> [18] </ref> in existing Chinese OCR systems. Table 5 lists the set of similar Chinese characters and the distances in terms of the three moment functions. The results show that moment methods perform well for all these pairs.
