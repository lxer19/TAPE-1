Reference-contexts: Anonymizer, Inc.'s policy of keeping verbose logs is clearly intended to control abuse. At a destination site's request, they will even program the Anonymizer to block client requests to anonymously contact that site <ref> [Ano97a] </ref>. This allows sites actively interested in tracking their clientele to easily opt-out of the anonymity mechanism altogether.

Reference-contexts: However, Anonymizer, Inc. has made some interesting policy decisions regarding the use of their service, most of which seem fully informed by the legal reality of doing business in California and the United States. In the Terms and Conditions as of September 24, 1997 <ref> [Ano97b] </ref>, they write 8.3 Usage logs are usually kept for fifteen (15) days for maintenance purposes, monitoring Spamming and monitoring abuses of netiquette. Any relevant portion (s) of such logs may be kept for as long as needed to stop the abuses.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Anonymity is not the same as confidentiality. Existing systems such as IPSEC can ably protect the contents of IP-based communication <ref> [Atk95, Pos81b] </ref>, making it impractical for network eavesdroppers to deduce the purpose of observed traffic. However, the fact of the traffic itself is not hidden; the sender and receiver of each packet is clearly visible in the packet headers even when the packet is end-to-end encrypted.

Reference-contexts: Since the graph is undi-rected, each random packet is added and subtracted once, and therefore g (t) = j2V If exactly one of the nodes i wanted to send a nonzero packet p (i; t), then g (t) = p (i; t). (Otherwise, a collision resolution procedure must follow, see <ref> [Cha88, Mar88, BdB90, Pfi90, Wai90] </ref> for options.) Each gateway in the system checks to see if the packet g (t) bears its address in its source field, and if so, that gateway assumes responsibility and transmits the packet out of the lanon.

Reference-contexts: Often the granularity is even larger, as in the case of most web traffic, where the first TCP connection delivers the HTML source and separate TCP connections are created to fetch embedded images and other secondary structures <ref> [BLC95, FGM + 97] </ref>. An eavesdropper aware that an HTML transfer is in progress would have good reason to suspect that two back-to-back TCP streams originate from the same node even if their source labels appear unrelated. In general, unlinkability stands at odds with efficiency in communication.

Reference-contexts: Meanwhile, another remailer would appear elsewhere. Cypherpunk remailers are widely available; see [Lev]. 2.3 The (Web) Anonymizer The Anonymizer http://www.anonymizer.com, provided by Anonymizer, Inc., can be thought of as a remailer for HTTP <ref> [BLFN96, FGM + 97] </ref> traffic. Since HTTP transactions are completely self-contained, no long-term mapping for return addresses is required. The Anonymizer just removes revealing HTTP headers and relays the results.

Reference-contexts: Mix networks have been analyzed, extended, and implemented in [PPW89, Pfi90, PPW91, PP90].

In the following sections, we briefly sketch the implementations and designs relevant to our pursuit. 2.1 Anon.penet.fi The Internet host anon.penet.fi, maintained by Jo-han Helsingius, ran as a cleartext email forwarding agent from 1993 until it closed in 1996.

Reference-contexts: The first category includes trusted-host rewriting schemes such as those used in anon.penet.fi and the Web Anonymizer. Mix-derived <ref> [Cha81] </ref> systems such as Cypherpunk, Mixmas-ter, and Babel remailers; Onion Routing; Crowds; and the Non-Disclosure Method for mobile IP stations also fall into the family of dispersed architectures. Almost as well represented in the literature, but largely unimplemented, are the local schemes invariably based on DC networks [Cha88]. <p> In turn, most of these are Mix-derived. However, two low-security simple rewriting schemes have completely dominated the Internet anonymity field: the Penet mail rewriter and the (Web) Anonymizer. Mix networks and DC networks were both invented by David Chaum; see <ref> [Cha81] </ref> and [Cha88] for his original papers on the topic. Mix networks have been analyzed, extended, and implemented in [PPW89, Pfi90, PPW91, PP90]. DC networks are usually considered a more elegant but less practical anonymity scheme than Mix networks. <p> Babel extends the possibility of anonymous reply to receivers of anonymous email with reply onions, a feature envisioned by Chaum <ref> [Cha81] </ref> and implemented both in the Non-Disclosure Method described below and the remailer reply service nym.alias.net [Nym97] (which is not described here). The Babel implementation is not currently available to the public. Generally speaking, the Mix design works well with email because email tends to be insensitive to network latency.

Reference-contexts: Mix-derived [Cha81] systems such as Cypherpunk, Mixmas-ter, and Babel remailers; Onion Routing; Crowds; and the Non-Disclosure Method for mobile IP stations also fall into the family of dispersed architectures. Almost as well represented in the literature, but largely unimplemented, are the local schemes invariably based on DC networks <ref> [Cha88] </ref>. The following sections address both kinds of schemes in turn. 1.1 Dispersed Anonymity Architecture Generally speaking, the dispersed designs provide comprehensive untraceability in the following manner. The promoters of a dispersed anonymous service first deposit forwarding agents throughout the Internet. <p> In turn, most of these are Mix-derived. However, two low-security simple rewriting schemes have completely dominated the Internet anonymity field: the Penet mail rewriter and the (Web) Anonymizer. Mix networks and DC networks were both invented by David Chaum; see [Cha81] and <ref> [Cha88] </ref> for his original papers on the topic. Mix networks have been analyzed, extended, and implemented in [PPW89, Pfi90, PPW91, PP90]. DC networks are usually considered a more elegant but less practical anonymity scheme than Mix networks. <p> Since the graph is undi-rected, each random packet is added and subtracted once, and therefore g (t) = j2V If exactly one of the nodes i wanted to send a nonzero packet p (i; t), then g (t) = p (i; t). (Otherwise, a collision resolution procedure must follow, see <ref> [Cha88, Mar88, BdB90, Pfi90, Wai90] </ref> for options.) Each gateway in the system checks to see if the packet g (t) bears its address in its source field, and if so, that gateway assumes responsibility and transmits the packet out of the lanon. <p> In other words, all suspicions are equally plausible and therefore equally worthless. As long as the packet streams r (fi; jg; t) are secret and random, no information about the true senders is leaked. This protocol and the original untraceability proof is due to Chaum <ref> [Cha88] </ref>. It has been extended in [Pfi90, Wai90, WP90], where it is known as superposed sending. The above formulation is from [Wai90, WP90]. 5.3 Minimizing Latency Trusted gateways and DC nets require every node to transmit at least once before a single packet emerges from the lanon.

Reference-contexts: A nonresponsive or withdrawn gateway node is even more difficult. In addition to the anonymity threats described above, all of the connections using the gateway address are in jeopardy unless the address can be resurrected in the lanon. In an Ethernet, another gateway could attempt to use promiscuous ARP <ref> [CMQ87] </ref> to assume its identity and carry its traffic. Whether this would work or not depends on the LAN's border router.

Reference-contexts: At the time, the Macintosh OS did not support multiprogramming, so nodes in the experiment were either purely Mix forwarders or specialized application endpoints. The system supported one-way anonymous messages, not bidirectional streams. 2.5 The Mixmaster and Babel Remailers The Mixmaster for email by Lance Cottrell 1 <ref> [Cot] </ref> is probably the most perfectly suited implementation of Mix technology to date. It includes facets of the Mix design such as replay detection, uniform sizing, buffering, and reordering, all of which contribute to the untraceability of messages.

Reference-contexts: The technology is almost as easy to deploy as Cypherpunk remailers, the only difference being that one needs to use a special client for sending mail with the Mixmaster. The Mixmaster is currently available within the U.S. at <ref> [Cot96] </ref>. Gene Tsudik and Ceki G ulc u at IBM Zurich developed a similar remailer called Babel, described in detail in [GT96], that improves on the design and exposition of the Mixmaster.

Reference-contexts: However, the advertisement of final destinations to every encountered node may also be seen as a disadvantage, since it stands at odds with receiver anonymity. The Crowds system is currently in alpha testing phase. See <ref> [Cro] </ref> for more information. 2.8 The Non-Disclosure Method The Mix-based Non-Disclosure Method (NDM) of An-dreas Fasbender, Dogan Kesdogan, and Olaf Kubitz [FKK96b] hides the source and destination addresses of an IP packet from every node except the packet's destination.

Anonymizer, Inc.'s policy of keeping verbose logs is clearly intended to control abuse. At a destination site's request, they will even program the Anonymizer to block client requests to anonymously contact that site [Ano97a].

This case is sometimes misunderstood because it has many strange facets: the notion that religious scripture can be copyrighted at all, the bewildering aggressiveness with which the copyright owner pursued its case, the seismic culture clash between lawyers and netizens, and the international scope and several jurisdictions involved.

Reference-contexts: Without the persistent database, no anonymous ID is available to enable return mail (although the service nym.alias.net <ref> [Nym97] </ref> helps with this problem). Since there is no single point of presence, and since the individual remailers are very easy to set up, legal action or network attacks are unlikely to threaten the system as a whole. <p> Babel extends the possibility of anonymous reply to receivers of anonymous email with reply onions, a feature envisioned by Chaum [Cha81] and implemented both in the Non-Disclosure Method described below and the remailer reply service nym.alias.net <ref> [Nym97] </ref> (which is not described here). The Babel implementation is not currently available to the public. Generally speaking, the Mix design works well with email because email tends to be insensitive to network latency.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Anonymity is not the same as confidentiality. Existing systems such as IPSEC can ably protect the contents of IP-based communication <ref> [Atk95, Pos81b] </ref>, making it impractical for network eavesdroppers to deduce the purpose of observed traffic. However, the fact of the traffic itself is not hidden; the sender and receiver of each packet is clearly visible in the packet headers even when the packet is end-to-end encrypted.

Reference-contexts: Unlinkability means that independently observed messages seem uncorrelated even when they comprise a single logical traffic stream. Unlinkability only makes sense when the semantics of the message flows do not require a priori correlations, so unlinkability must always be considered with respect a certain granularity. For example, TCP <ref> [Pos81c] </ref> streams require recipients to acknowledge sent data. Therefore, if an eavesdropper knows that a certain outbound flow comprises a TCP stream, then they will rightly expect to observe (at least) an inbound flow of acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: Naval Research Laboratory describe an implementation based on the Mix design called Onion Routing <ref> [GRS96, SGR97] </ref>. Their implementation defines protocols for bidirectional streams, currently rlogin, HTTP, and SMTP (email). The forwarding nodes called onion routers maintain permanent encrypted TCP connections to each other, and the Mix structure is built on top of that virtual network.

Reference-contexts: Mix networks have been analyzed, extended, and implemented in [PPW89, Pfi90, PPW91, PP90]. DC networks are usually considered a more elegant but less practical anonymity scheme than Mix networks. Accordingly, the literature describing DC networks is mostly theoretical <ref> [Wai90, WP90, Pfi90, Bot90, DO97] </ref>. In the following sections, we briefly sketch the implementations and designs relevant to our pursuit. 2.1 Anon.penet.fi The Internet host anon.penet.fi, maintained by Jo-han Helsingius, ran as a cleartext email forwarding agent from 1993 until it closed in 1996. <p> The simplest mechanism is for the gateway to reflect transmitted packets back onto the lanon so that each node knows when its packet emerged. (If the anonymity policy requires protection against active attacks, then even this becomes involved; see <ref> [Wai90] </ref>.) 4.3 Anonymous IP Address Sets Here we consider methods to determine the set of anonymous addresses that can be used in a lanon. The set is a relatively stable (see x4.5) global parameter shared by lanon members. <p> Since the graph is undi-rected, each random packet is added and subtracted once, and therefore g (t) = j2V If exactly one of the nodes i wanted to send a nonzero packet p (i; t), then g (t) = p (i; t). (Otherwise, a collision resolution procedure must follow, see <ref> [Cha88, Mar88, BdB90, Pfi90, Wai90] </ref> for options.) Each gateway in the system checks to see if the packet g (t) bears its address in its source field, and if so, that gateway assumes responsibility and transmits the packet out of the lanon. <p> As long as the packet streams r (fi; jg; t) are secret and random, no information about the true senders is leaked. This protocol and the original untraceability proof is due to Chaum [Cha88]. It has been extended in <ref> [Pfi90, Wai90, WP90] </ref>, where it is known as superposed sending. The above formulation is from [Wai90, WP90]. 5.3 Minimizing Latency Trusted gateways and DC nets require every node to transmit at least once before a single packet emerges from the lanon. <p> This protocol and the original untraceability proof is due to Chaum [Cha88].
