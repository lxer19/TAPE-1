Title: A Software Toolkit for Prototyping Distributed Applications (Preliminary Report)  
Author: James C. French Charles L. Viles

Pubnum: Technical Report CS-92-26  
Abstract: We describe a set of software tools for rapid prototyping of distributed applications. The toolkit is based upon a model of computational agents that are distributed in a developer specified manner throughout a host network of workstations. The model makes no assumptions concerning network heterogeneity. The distribution and functionality of agents completely specifies the communication patterns and topology of the distributed system. Agents that follow the communication protocol may be written in any language. The intended usage of this toolkit is for both education and rapid prototyping of distributed applications.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction For the distributed systems neophyte, it is often difficult to understand the issues that arise in developing a distributed application or porting an application from a centralized to a distributed environment. While these issues are well known <ref> (Mullender, 1989, Tanenbaum and van Renesse, 1985) </ref>, the fundamental problems they cause can be better appreciated through actual involvement in a distributed application. For example, transparent naming is often cited as a requirement in a distributed application. Though a *.
