Title: Sprees, a Finite-State Orthographic Learning System that Recognizes and Generates Phonologically Similar Spellings

Abstract: We present a computer learning program named Sprees that learns by building a deterministic finite state automaton that represents orthographic generalizations of the spellings it encounters. It then uses the automaton to recognize and generate phonologically similar spellings beyond those in the initial training set. The saying, i before e except after c, demonstrates the kind of spelling regularity Sprees would learn after being exposed to words like receive and thief.

The aims of those works however are not the same as the goals of Sprees. A spell checker should reliably identify misspellings, but one objective of Sprees is to recognize spellings that sound like words whether they are actually known English words or not.

Reference-contexts: It is a regular grammar that is right-linear and right-linear grammars generate regular languages, which we already know is the language of a Sprees automaton. Regular grammars are the most restricted class of Chomskys grammatical formalisms. Their generative capacity is considered the least powerful <ref> (Chomsky, 1957) </ref>. Let M s be the Sprees Automaton we are to build. M s begins with only the start state. Let T be the set of preprocessed training words from which we are to build a Sprees automaton. For each word, w T, do the following: a.

Reference-contexts: Sprees was used in conjunction with stored lists to determine whether words sounded like medical terms, family names, first names, and so forth, and the overall system performed extremely well in locating all references to personally-identifying information <ref> (Sweeney, 1996) </ref>. Sprees also extrapolates nonsense words, which are words that look and sound like English words but in reality have no meaning. For example, "throck" which comes from exposure to words like "throw" and "rock" is a nonsense word. The generation of new words has many uses.
