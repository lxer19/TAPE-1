Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The star network <ref> [2] </ref> has received considerable attention recently by researchers as a graph model for interconnection network. It has been shown that it is an attractive alternative to the widely used hypercube model. Like the hypercube, the star network is vertex- and edge-symmetric, strongly hierarchical, and maximally fault tolerant. <p> Moreover, it has a smaller diameter and degree while comparing with hypercube of comparable number of vertices. The rich structural properties of the star networks have been studied by many researchers. The n-star network S n is a degree n 1, (n 1)-connected, and vertex symmetric Cayley graph <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Jwo, Lakshmivarahan, and Dhall [17] showed that the star networks are hamiltonian. Qiu, Akl, and Meijer [24] showed that the n-star network can be decomposed into (n 1)! node-disjoint paths of length n 1, and can be decomposed into (n 2)! node-disjoint cycles of length (n 1)n. <p> Nigam, S. Sahni, and B. Krishnamurthy [22] and by Miller, Pritikin, and Sudborough [20]. Broadcasting on star networks has also been studied recently [3, 4, 14, 25]. Routing on star networks was first studied by Akers and Krishnamurthy <ref> [2] </ref> who derived a formula for the length of the shortest path between any two nodes in a star network and developed an efficient algorithm for constructing such a path. Recently, parallel routing, i.e., constructing node-disjoint paths, on star networks has received much attention. <p> Since the n-star network S n is (n 1)-vertex-connected <ref> [2] </ref> and every node in S n is of degree n 1, by Menger's theorem [19], for any pair of nodes u and v in S n , there is a width n 1 container between u and v. Moreover, since the n-star network is vertex symmetric [2], a width n <p> is (n 1)-vertex-connected <ref> [2] </ref> and every node in S n is of degree n 1, by Menger's theorem [19], for any pair of nodes u and v in S n , there is a width n 1 container between u and v. Moreover, since the n-star network is vertex symmetric [2], a width n 1 container between any two given nodes can be easily mapped to a width n 1 container of the same length between a node and the identity node " in S n . <p> If we further let l = P k i=1 jc i j, where jc i j denotes the number of symbols in the cycle c i , then the distance d (u) from the node u to the identity node " is given by the following formula <ref> [2] </ref>. d (u) = l + k if the primary cycle is a trivial cycle l + k 2 if the primary cycle is a nontrivial cycle Combining this formula with the above discussion on the effect of applying a transposition on a permutation, we derive the following necessary rules for <p> is a symbol in [ k i=2 c i that is not used in the construction of the paths P i and P 0 i , i = 2; : : : ; m, the construction of P can be obviously implemented in time O (n). (Note that according to <ref> [2] </ref>, d (u) = O (n).) To construct the paths P i and P 0 i , we need to find an unused symbol a 0 i . <p> Moreover, one may not expect to significantly improve the running time of the algorithm since the following lower bound can be easily observed | the distance d (u) from a node u to the identity node " can be as large as b3 (n 1)=2c (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Thus, constructing n 1 node-disjoint paths from u to " takes time at least fi (n 2 ) in the worst case. Acknowledgment.

Reference-contexts: Dietzfelbinger, Madhavapeddy, and Sudborough [11] derived an improved algorithm that constructs n1 node-disjoint paths of length bounded by 4 plus the diameter of S n . The algorithm was further improved by Day and Tripathi <ref> [10] </ref> who developed an efficient algorithm that constructs n 1 node-disjoint paths of length bounded by 4 plus the distance from u to v in S n . The problem was also investigated by Jwo, Lakshmivarahan, and Dhall [18]. <p> The basic idea of the algorithm can be roughly described as follows. Let u and v be two nodes in the n-star network S n . According to Day and Tripathi <ref> [10] </ref>, the (n 1)-wide distance d n1 (u; v) is equal to d (u; v) + b, where b = 0, 2, or 4. <p> Consequently, let P be a path from u to " in which exactly k edges do not follow the Shortest Path 4 Rules, then the length of the path P is equal to d (u) + 2k. Fact 2.4. <ref> [10] </ref> There are no cycles of odd length in the n-star network. Consequently, the length of any path from a node u to the node " is equal to d (u) plus an even number. <p> Parallel routing from a node u to " in S n is particularly simple when the primary cycle in u is a trivial cycle <ref> [10, 18] </ref>. For completeness, we describe the routing process for this case here. Let u be such a node in S n . For each symbol i, 2 i n, construct a path P i as follows. <p> c k e 1 e m , where c i are nontrivial cycles and e j are trivial cycles, and the primary cycle c 1 = (a 1 a 2 a p 1) is a nontrivial cycle. 3 Nodes with (n 1)-wide distance d (u) + 4 Day and Tripathi <ref> [10] </ref> have developed a parallel routing algorithm, of running time O (n 2 ), which constructs a width n 1 container of length d (u) + 4 from a node u to the identity node " in the n-star network S n . <p> The (n 1)-wide distance d n1 (u) from the node u to the identity node " is d (u) + 4 if and only if m &gt; minf2 k2 ; 1 + P k 4 Constructing length-d (u) containers of maximum width Theorem 3.3, together with Day and Tripathi's algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>, shows that when the (n 1)-wide distance d n1 (u) from a node u to the identity node " is equal to d (u) + 4, a width n 1 container of length d n1 (u) from u to " can be constructed in time O (n 2 ). <p> The correctness of the algorithm Optimal Parallel Routing has been proved by Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, Theorem 4.4, and the results in <ref> [10] </ref>.

For completeness, we describe the routing process for this case here. Let u be such a node in S n . For each symbol i, 2 i n, construct a path P i as follows. <p> Thus, the algorithm Maximum Shortest Routing runs in time O (n 2 log n). Construction of length-d (u) containers of the maximum width between two nodes in the star networks was previously studied in <ref> [18] </ref>, which presents an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the worst case. <p> More seriously, the algorithm seems based on an incorrect observation, which claims that when there are more than one nontrivial cycles in a node u, the width of a length-d (u) container of the maximum width from u to " is always an even number. Therefore, the algorithm in <ref> [18] </ref> always produces a length-d (u) container of an even width from u to ".

Reference-contexts: The rich structural properties of the star networks have been studied by many researchers. The n-star network S n is a degree n 1, (n 1)-connected, and vertex symmetric Cayley graph [1, 2]. Jwo, Lakshmivarahan, and Dhall [17] showed that the star networks are hamiltonian. Qiu, Akl, and Meijer <ref> [24] </ref> showed that the n-star network can be decomposed into (n 1)! node-disjoint paths of length n 1, and can be decomposed into (n 2)! node-disjoint cycles of length (n 1)n.

Reference-contexts: Recently, parallel routing, i.e., constructing node-disjoint paths, on star networks has received much attention. Sur and Srimni <ref> [26] </ref> demonstrated that n 1 node-disjoint paths can be constructed between any two nodes in S n in polynomial time. Dietzfelbinger, Madhavapeddy, and Sudborough [11] derived an improved algorithm that constructs n1 node-disjoint paths of length bounded by 4 plus the diameter of S n .
