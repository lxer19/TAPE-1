Abstract: Numerous approaches to verifying the safety of vehicles in the AHS architecture of PATH have been proposed (see [1] and [2]). One approach involves finding a boundary between safe and unsafe initial conditions. This task is significantly easier if we can guarantee that the severity of an accident is monotonic in the initial conditions. Simulation results are presented in which it is shown that this condition does not hold for the design of [1], and a hybrid automaton model explaining this situation is presented. Finally, some attempts to modify the control laws to obtain monotonicity are presented.

Reference-contexts: The latter disturbance changes the vehicle preceding car i and resets the relative distance and speed to a new initial condition. The cruise control law described in <ref> [1] </ref> is a switched mode controller that switches between different feedback control policies depending on which region of state space the system is in. The switching is necessary to ensure passenger comfort and stability of the system. <p> The switching is necessary to ensure passenger comfort and stability of the system. The system can be modeled as a hybrid automaton|a continuous time, continuous variable system with phased operation. This hybrid automaton model has been introduced in [4] and [5]. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle are modeled by a feedback linearizable third order nonlinear differential equation. After applying linearizing feedback, the resulting system can be represented by: where x i represents the position of the ith vehicle from a fixed roadside reference. <p> The objective of cruise control is to follow the preceding car, car i 1, at a safe distance. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the safe distance is given by D safe (t) = v _x i (t) + p with v = 1s and p = 10m. The controller must achieve this objective under passenger comfort and saturation constraints imposed on the engine jerk and the acceleration of the vehicle. <p> 7 7 = 6 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 7 5 6 6 z 1 z 3 3 7 5 2 6 4 1 0 7 7 u (z) + 6 6 0 0 3 7 5 u specifies the switched cruise control law of <ref> [1] </ref>. Note that the system has some constraints, due to the actuator saturation limits. In particular, the car cannot move backwards ( _x i 0), it cannot brake faster than 5m/s 2 (x i 5) and it cannot accelerate faster than 2m/s 2 (x i 2). <p> Regions 3 and 4 use affine feedback. Region 1 uses a nonlinear time-varying feedback. Controllers in Regions 1 and 4 are designed for passenger comfort, whereas the controller in Region 3 employs severe braking to avoid colliding with the preceding vehicle. Refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for more details. 3 Here we are ignoring the constraint that vehicle velocities must be nonnegative. 4 For a large number of initial conditions, the dependence of ^z 3 (the minimum spacing) on the initial conditions appears to be monotone. <p> Figure 5 shows the curve of ^z 3 vs. z 1 (0) with three local extrema, separating four separate monotone segments. One could conjecture that the extrema in To test this hypothesis, a small change was made to the switched mode controller. The controller presented in <ref> [1] </ref> has smooth transitions between regions, avoiding sudden changes in the control. Removing the smoothness of the transitions and recomputing, we obtain Figure 6. Indeed, the extrema at 18m/s and at 23.3m/s are now cusps. 4 Note, however, that the third extremum is still smooth. <p> The next greatest z 1 (0) for which the trajectory does pass through a corner is 24.2m/s. (Beyond this value, trajectories no longer enter Region 4 at all.) Thus the segment between 23.8m/s and 24.2m/s is not monotone. 3 Extended Hybrid Automaton The switched mode controller as presented in <ref> [1] </ref> has four discrete states corresponding to different modes of operation, with complicated boundaries and dynamics. By extending the number of states, we can describe a new hybrid automaton with simple dynamics in each state. <p> With this hybrid automaton model, we can now examine the different portions of Figure 6. 5 Since e = z 3 v z 1 p , we have _e = z 4 v z 2 . Since e will be increasing whenever _e &gt; 0, for z = <ref> [8; 5; 1; 4:5] </ref>, the e-v state will be on the boundary between Regions 3 and 4, heading into Region 4.

Reference-contexts: This is clearly only one point in an infinite dimensional vector space (the acceleration of the car in front is a function of time). We need to check that the safe regions are in fact safe for all possible acceleration profiles. It is suggested in <ref> [2] </ref> that the worst case scenario is most likely the situation where the car in front cuts in and then applies maximum braking.

Reference-contexts: An in-depth discussion of the PATH design is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The vehicles perform simple maneuvers such as joining into platoons, splitting the platoons, cruising, following the leader, changing lanes, and entry and exit. These are linguistic descriptions of classes of continuous trajectories that the vehicles follow. Continuous control laws have been developed for these individual maneuvers.
