Abstract: In this paper we present a protocol that controls automated autonomous vehicles driving on a multiple merge junction highway. The protocol is distributed and it controls both merging and yielding. We show a simulation study that presents the protocol and its impacts on safety and congestion under different operating conditions. Our main result is that for simultaneous safe and efficient operations of autonomous automated vehicles the desired time headway must be linked to the travel demand on the highway segment.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present an original distributed merge protocol that controls autonomous vehicles. We model a 10 km highway section, which includes three merge junctions and three exit ramps. We analyze the performance of the protocol through micro-simulation (see the companion paper <ref> [2] </ref> for a transportation-centric viewpoint). The entire application is programmed within the SmartAHS framework 1 [3], which is built upon the Shift programming language [4]. Shift is a simulation language for Hybrid Systems.
