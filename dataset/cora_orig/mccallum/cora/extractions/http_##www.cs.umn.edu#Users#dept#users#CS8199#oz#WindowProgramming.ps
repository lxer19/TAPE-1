Abstract: This paper describes how to do window programming in DFKI Oz. The DFKI Oz window interface is based on the Tk toolkit which in turn is based on the script language Tcl. It provides a high level abstraction of Tk widgets allowing for object-oriented and concurrent window programming. A generic translation scheme from Oz values to Tcl/Tk commands provides for minimality and flexibility on the Oz side.

The documentation of the module Tk follows in general the conventions used in The Oz Standard Modules <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 Translation from Oz to Tcl/Tk Many procedures and messages take tickles as arguments. Tickles are Oz values which are translated into Tcl/Tk words by means of a generic translation. The argument type tickle is indicated by the abbreviation Tcl in the name of the argument.
