Abstract: A transpose-free two-sided nonsymmetric Lanczos method is developed for multiple starting vectors on both the left and right. The method is applied to the computation of the matrix Pade approximation to a linear dynamical system. The result is a method which can be labeled Transpose-Free Matrix Pade Via Lanczos. The method is mathematically equivalent to the two-sided methods, but avoids the use of the transpose of the system matrix, and under certain circumstances will actually reduce the total number of matrix-vector products needed. The method is illustrated with some numerical examples.
