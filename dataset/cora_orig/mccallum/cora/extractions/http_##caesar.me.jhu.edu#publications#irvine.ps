Abstract: This paper discusses issues in the design and implementation of metamorphic robotic systems. A metamorphic robotic system is a collection of independently controlled mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. A metamorphic system can dynamically reconfigure by the locomotion of modules over their neighbors. Thus they can be viewed as a collection of connected modular robots which act together to perform the given task. The planar metamorphic robots described in this paper consist of hexagonal or square modules. Because of their shape, the modules completely fill the plane without any gaps, their centers forming a regular lattice. Both the hexagonal and square modules are provided with electromechanical coupling mechanisms actuated by D.C. motors. These connectors help to couple and uncouple modules as they move around each other to form different configurations. The modules are currently controlled by an external processor.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION A metamorphic robotic system <ref> [Ch94] </ref> is a collection of independently controlled mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. Each module allows power and information to flow through itself and to its neighbors. <p> This is important because a metamorphic robotic system may frequently need to reconfigure, and so the connection between modules must be reliable. The motion planning problem of a metamorphic robot has been previouly discussed by <ref> [Ch94, PECh95] </ref>. [SMCh93] consider the motion of planar hexagonal metamorphic modules using 'local' constraints and describe the performance of various algorithms under these constraints. 3 BASIC DESIGN AND LOCOMOTION OF HEXAGONAL MODULES This section describes the design of planar hexagonal modules and the locomotion process of the modules. 2 Copyright c <p> The motion of the mobile module is achieved by controlling the three degrees of freedom of the module by three actuators on alternate joints. For a detailed description of the kinematics of the mechanism and how joint angles are altered see <ref> [Ch94] </ref>. Any implementation of the locomotion process described above in practice has problems because of the finite thickness of the links.

Reference-contexts: Most recently, two other types of modular reconfigurable robotic systems have been considered. [Yim93,Yim94] considered modular robots composed of a few basic elements which can be composed into complex systems, and used for various modes of locomotion. <ref> [MuKK94, MuKK95] </ref> considered a `fractal' system composed of modules with zero kinematic mobility, but which can `walk' over each other in discrete quanta due to changes in the polarity of magnetic fields. <p> When the old connection is released (by repulsing the electromagnets forming the connection), the electromagnets align the links completely due to magnetic force. The rigid connection between the modules is provided by the magnetic force between the two connectors . A similar scheme has been used by <ref> [MuKK94, MuKK95] </ref> in the development of self-assembling machines or `fracta'. The problem with this approach is that connection between different modules are active instead of passive.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage of the above design is that the locking mechanism is passive in the stationary state and so uses very little power. A working prototype using the above design is shown in Figure 4.
