Abstract: This work deals with the consistency of finite difference approximations. We investigate the relation between the consistency of a numerical scheme and the consistency of its adjoint. We exhibit examples of numerical schemes which are consistent with a (direct) equation and whose adjoint is not consistent with the adjoint equation. This undesirable feature appears in the application of the adjoint state technique which requires an adjointness relation to be satisfied. Therefore, the numerical scheme for the adjoint equation is determined by the choice of the numerical scheme on the direct equation. We conclude that in general consistency is not conserved by adjointness.

The inconsistency of the adjoint scheme seems to be a direct consequence of the upwind character equation for different depth. The depth z = 3 is the initial data curve.

Reference-contexts: L (V;V ) ! 0 when h ! 0 The consistency of the adjoint scheme L fl h means therefore that jjP h L fl L fl h P h jj L (V;V ) ! 0 when h ! 0 So except when L and L h are self-adjoint (cf <ref> [12] </ref>) the consistency of L h does not imply the consistency of L fl h . Furthermore when both the chosen scheme and its adjoint are consistent, they do not have necessarily have the same order of accuracy.
