Abstract: The construction of software systems from pre-existing, independently developed software components will only occur when application builders can adapt software components to suit their needs. Our ADAPT framework [Hein97] supports both component designers in creating components that can easily be adapted, and application builders in adapting software components. We propose that software components provide two interfaces -- one for behavior and one for adapting that behavior as needed. In this position paper, we outline some requirements for composing software systems from components and suggest that adaptation be recognized as a significant factor.
