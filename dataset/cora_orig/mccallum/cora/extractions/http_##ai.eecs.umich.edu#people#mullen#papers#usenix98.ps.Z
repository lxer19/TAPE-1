Abstract: In this paper, we present one such commerce mid-dleware component | an Auction Manager designed to simplify and automate both the creation of new markets and the matching of users to existing markets. The Auction Manager determines which markets are appropriate for a given buyer or seller using market-specific inference rules applied to the current market offerings. We also show how these same inference rules can be used by the Auction Manager to automatically compose and decompose market offerings to respond to changing conditions within the marketplace. Finally, we describe how the Auction Manager provides a focal point for expressing policy decisions such as how much to charge for starting and running auctions, as well as who and when to charge.

Reference-contexts: Policies can be implemented through either rules or incentives. For example, policy issues such as information access management <ref> [1] </ref>, which determine who may access what collections and under what terms and conditions, are more naturally handled as rules.

Reference-contexts: For example, when and for what goods should new markets be started? How does the system account for market creation costs? How are community rules, norms, and objectives (if any) expressed|through regulations or incentives? The Auction Manager was built as part of the University of Michigan Digital Library <ref> [2] </ref> (UMDL) commerce infrastructure. Whereas UMDL's goal is the provision of library services to library users, the explict realization of that goal is to provide a commerce infrastructure that supports the process of describing, locating, and negotiating for a wide variety of information services.

Reference-contexts: Although historically goods have often been unprofitable to bundle, in the case of information goods and services (with marginal costs close to zero) selling bundled goods can yield higher profits and greater efficiency than selling them separately <ref> [3] </ref>. One ongoing field trial in this area includes the PEAK project, offering Elsevier journal articles with different experimental bundles and prices [13]. What we introduce here is the ability of the buyer or seller to choose a sub-bundle of the bundled goods, as defined in Table 2.

Reference-contexts: the resultant market configurations. 4.2 Market selection issues Given the potentially unbounded number of markets that can be created for a partially specified service, how do we decide which market should be created? In the past, market selection has been addressed in work on incomplete markets [10, 15], product differentiation <ref> [5] </ref>, and industrial organization with transaction costs [23]. This work generally involved analyzing the effects for a known and static number of markets.

Reference-contexts: Some standalone products aim to provide some of this function. For example, shopping agents, such as Bargain Finder (http://bf.cstar.ac.com/bf) and Jango <ref> [6] </ref> (http://www.jango.com), provide consumers with compilations of Internet vendors' prices for products such as music CDs or software. In contrast, middle-ware for this type of task is more infrastructural, serving individual functions as generally as possible, in the context of supporting an overall commerce process.

Reference-contexts: This work generally involved analyzing the effects for a known and static number of markets. When neither the exact number nor kind markets can be known ahead of time, methods for comparing and evaluating the benefits of different market configurations <ref> [7] </ref> will need to be developed. Using such comparisons, we can hope to identify general rules or incentives that promote commerce environments having increased efficiency, profits, surplus or any number of other criteria.

Reference-contexts: The second part comprises the various infrastructure components, described in Section 2.3, which simplify and automate the use of these languages and protocols. 2.1 Description languages for goods Description languages, or ontologies <ref> [8] </ref>, permit a large number of potential goods and their attributes to be captured as a taxonomy. Using these structured objects, we can identify and reason about classes of goods [4]|a powerful base for reusable automation. For example, one common library service is that of answering queries.

Reference-contexts: More specialized commerce environments, such as business-to-consumer commerce, might include additional steps such as promotion. The role of commerce mid-dleware is to serve agents taking these steps. One can conceive of reusable support services targeted at individual steps (or parts of steps), or those spanning multiple steps <ref> [9] </ref>. Probably the most well-defined of these steps is the fourth|executing the transaction|and indeed, the largest share of middleware services termed "electronic commerce" primarily address this step.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we will need to place restrictions on the rules of inference to be able to guarantee termination. Similar problems for automatic checking of security protocols using formal logics were addressed by an automatic theory-checker generator <ref> [12] </ref>. 3.1.3 Automatic market arbitrage Our discussion of the inference rules in table 3 above has implicitly made the assumption that selecting the appropriate good from several others is a simple operation.

Reference-contexts: For example, if a seller has a monopoly good in the current marketplace, the same good would be sold under very different terms than in a more competitive marketplace. Auctions, which are simply a set of rules for determining a price and/or allocation based on a bidding protocol <ref> [16] </ref>, provide a very flexible negotiation framework|each different auction institution can have a large effect on trading outcome. In effect, auctions are just another service|they provide matching and price setting for buyers and sellers.

Reference-contexts: Each of these two choice operators composes individual articles into a different, more abstract, bundled article market. The idea of bundled goods is far from new, and has been generally addressed in economic literature as an alternative technique for price discrimination <ref> [17] </ref>. By reducing the dispersion in consumer tastes across different bundles a seller can often extract more value from transactions than uniform pricing would.

Reference-contexts: We capture information about the different auction rules and protocols in a compact, reusable manner by using parameterized auction descriptions <ref> [18, 25] </ref>. For example, an auction's attributes include how often it clears, its price determination rules (e.g., first price, second price), the allowed number of buyers and sellers, as well as what information is publicly available.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out by MacKie-Mason and White [14], even this relatively circumscribed step presents interesting design choices along many dimensions. Probably the least well-defined step is the first| describing the good. Ongoing work in developing descriptive metadata for e-commerce ranges from formalizing license terms descriptions <ref> [19] </ref> to more ad hoc discussions of XML-based content definitions such as CommerceNet's XML exchange (http://www.xmlx.com). In this paper, we focus on middleware services for step two.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on middleware services for step two. However, we build on the growing presence and increasing understanding of the value of on-line auctions <ref> [20] </ref> for step three|setting the terms of an agreement and matching buyers with sellers. We describe here an Auction Manager, a commerce middleware component designed to simplify and automate both the creation of new markets and the matching of agents to existing markets.

Reference-contexts: Also, as buyer agents and/or recommending organizations learn which information providers and kinds of services they prefer, they should be free to establish markets which capture these preferences <ref> [21] </ref>. However, allowing agents to decide which markets to create means that the externalities involved in creating an auction, such as the costs to the system and other users, must be internalized in the form of auction fees.

Reference-contexts: For example, agents might describe the particular kind of query planning service they are providing or seeking in terms defined in some standard vocabulary. An agent sends this service description to the Service Classifier <ref> [22] </ref>. The Service Classifier classifies the service within a comprehensive taxonomy of information services and responds with a service label. The service label acts as a tag identifying a classified service within the system. In step two, agents want to locate auctions where they can buy or sell the service.

Reference-contexts: The second is by using economic theory to set up auctions depending on what kind of agent requests it. For example, the Auction Manager can choose an auction which is incentive compatible for buyers or for sellers, but not both <ref> [24] </ref>. In the case of library agents, where the focus is more oriented towards designing simpler agents to allocate library services efficiently, the Auction Manager could have a library policy to determine which are the best auctions to create.
