Reference-contexts: Franzblau and Kleitman [7] gave a polynomial time algorithm for covering the interior of a vertically convex rectilinear polygon with the minimum number of rectangles, which improved a previous result of Chaiken et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Lubiw [8, 9] gave polynomial time algorithm for the interior cover problem for a somewhat larger class of polygons, called the plaid polygons. <p> Although it is true that any cover of the interior also covers the boundary and any cover of the interior or boundary also covers the corners, these three cover sizes need not be the same. For example, in fig. 5 of <ref> [1] </ref> the optimal corner cover size is 7 but the optimal boundary or interior cover size is 8, and in fig. 6 of [1] the optimal boundary cover size is 7 but the optimal interior cover size is 8. <p> For example, in fig. 5 of <ref> [1] </ref> the optimal corner cover size is 7 but the optimal boundary or interior cover size is 8, and in fig. 6 of [1] the optimal boundary cover size is 7 but the optimal interior cover size is 8. However, to our knowledge, there is no result in the existing literature which proves a tight bound between the relative sizes of these three types of covers in general. <p> When the cover size is minimum and the size of the anti-rectangle set is maximum, the equality = ff holds for some special cases of the cover problems. However, the equality is not true in general for either the interior, boundary or corner cover problems <ref> [1] </ref>. Erdos asked if the ratio =ff is bounded for interior cover problem for arbitrary rectilinear polygons (mentioned by Chaiken et. al. [1]) and the answer is not known yet (the best known bound is ff = O (log ff) [6]). <p> However, the equality is not true in general for either the interior, boundary or corner cover problems <ref> [1] </ref>. Erdos asked if the ratio =ff is bounded for interior cover problem for arbitrary rectilinear polygons (mentioned by Chaiken et. al. [1]) and the answer is not known yet (the best known bound is ff = O (log ff) [6]). Initially, while describing our corner cover heuristic, we assume that the given polygon has no degenerate convex corner.

Reference-contexts: Also, an investigation of these problems has given rise to special kinds of perfect graphs of interest [12]. Masek [10] was the first to show that the interior cover problem is NP-complete for rectilinear polygons with holes. Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [2] </ref> later showed that the boundary cover problem is NP-complete for polygons with holes, even if the polygon is in general position. <p> Lubiw [8, 9] gave polynomial time algorithm for the interior cover problem for a somewhat larger class of polygons, called the plaid polygons. Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [2] </ref> gave polynomial time algorithm for covering the convex corners of a rectilinear polygon or horizontal perimeter segments of a rectilinear polygon in general position. <p> For the corner cover, it is sufficient that each corner is on the boundary (possibly a corner) of one of the rectangles in the given set. Note that this differs from a similar problem as defined in Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [2] </ref> in which each concave corner of the given polygon has to be covered optimally by rectangles such that for some * &gt; 0 every point on each of the two perimeter segment defining the concave corner, within distance * of the concave corner, is covered by a rectangle. <p> We redefine a convex cover to be a proper cover that needs to cover convex corners only. Henceforth, whenever we refer to a cover, we mean a proper cover only. The following result is proved by Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [2] </ref>. Proposition 3.2 For a given rectilinear polygon P without hole having n vertices, all the type-3 and type-4 rectangles of a proper cover can be found in O (n) time.

Reference-contexts: They also showed that the corner cover problem is NP-complete if we require each concave corner to be covered by two rectangles along both the perimeter segments defining the corner. For a long time the complexity of this problem was unknown for polygons without holes, until Culberson and Reckhow <ref> [3] </ref> showed the interior and boundary cover problems are NP-complete even if the polygon has no holes, and even if the polygon is required to be in general position. [4] shows, among other results, that there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme for either the boundary or the interior cover problems unless

In this paper, we address the the corner cover problems. In <ref> [4] </ref>, it was shown that the corner cover problem is NP-complete and a simple heuristic was proposed that runs in O (n 3=2 ) time with a performance ratio of 4. <p> In this section we exhibit a heuristic, show that it achieves a performance ratio of 2 for the case when the given polygon has no holes and runs faster than the one described in <ref> [4] </ref>. The analysis of the heuristic involves a very careful amortization scheme and we believe similar technique may be useful for analysis of heuristics for other geometric problems as well. 3.1 An Overview Of The Heuristic.

Reference-contexts: We keep the k corners of the loop in an array of size O (k) with a start and an end pointer. The corners of the loop are also organized in the balanced binary tree structure for two-dimensional range searching as in <ref> [5] </ref> (see also [16]), where instead of storing the coordinates of the corners, we store a pointer to the appropriate entry in the array. This structure takes O (k log k) time to build.

Reference-contexts: Conn and O'Rourke [2] gave polynomial time algorithm for covering the convex corners of a rectilinear polygon or horizontal perimeter segments of a rectilinear polygon in general position. Regarding approximate solutions, Franzblau <ref> [6] </ref> analyzed a polynomial-time heuristic for the interior cover problem which approximates the optimum with a performance ratio of O (log ), where is the optimal cover size. <p> Erdos asked if the ratio =ff is bounded for interior cover problem for arbitrary rectilinear polygons (mentioned by Chaiken et. al. [1]) and the answer is not known yet (the best known bound is ff = O (log ff) <ref> [6] </ref>). Initially, while describing our corner cover heuristic, we assume that the given polygon has no degenerate convex corner. Later, we show that the heuristic works with the same performance ratio even if degenerate convex corners are allowed. 3 Approximation Algorithm for Corner Cover for Polygons With out Holes. <p> We have proposed efficient heuristic for the corner cover problems for rectilinear polygons without holes. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, it is still open if one could design an approximation algorithm with constant performance ratio for the interior cover problem. Franzblau <ref> [6] </ref> proposes a sweep-line heuristic that guarantees a constant performance ratio if the polygon has no holes, but the upper bound for the performance ratio proved there is O (log ) (where is the optimal cover size) when the polygon has holes.

Reference-contexts: Since the rectilinear cover problems are mostly NP-hard in general, there has been a lot of interest in finding exact solutions for special cases of these problems in polynomial time. Franzblau and Kleitman <ref> [7] </ref> gave a polynomial time algorithm for covering the interior of a vertically convex rectilinear polygon with the minimum number of rectangles, which improved a previous result of Chaiken et. al. [1].

Reference-contexts: Little progress has been made in finding efficient algorithms for covering arbitrary polygons with primitive shapes, and many such problems are known to be NP-hard [15].
