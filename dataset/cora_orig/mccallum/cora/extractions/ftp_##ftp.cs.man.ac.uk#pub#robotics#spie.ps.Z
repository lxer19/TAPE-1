Abstract: Remote access to robotics facilites allows robotics research to be conducted even if resources are not available locally. To investigate the feasibility of robotics experimentation via internet, we have conducted two independent experiments in which the Manchester mobile robot FortyTwo has been operated from a remote site,using a standard internet connection. In the first experiment ("Channellink") experimenters at Bremen University explored and mapped the robotics laboratory at Manchester, in a second experiment ("At-lanticlink") the Manchester robot was controlled from Pittsburgh and performed exploration, mapping and object manipulation tasks.
