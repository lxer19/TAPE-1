Reference-contexts: Finally, although speech does not appear to contain simple, reliable acoustic markers of word boundaries, some allophonic variations are correlated with the locations of word boundaries, including lengthening <ref> (Christophe, Dupoux, Bertoncini, & Mehler, 1994) </ref> and reduction of aspiration (see Church, 1987; Gow & Gordon, 1995, for further discussion). I refer to all these constraints as non-lexical, since they do not rely on familiarity with individual vocabulary items.

Reference-contexts: Acquisition and non-lexical cues..Among language-acquisition researchers, the focus of research has been constraints on the forms of words in particular languages. For example, the predominant stress pattern for bisyllabic words in English is strong-weak (e.g., mommy); weak-strong words (e.g., allow) are substantially rarer <ref> (Cutler & Carter, 1987) </ref>. There is now evidence that English-learning 9-month-olds know this (Jusczyk, Cutler, & Redanz, 1993a) and show a greater tendency to segment out strong-weak words than weak-strong words (Jusczyk, Newsome, & Houston, 1995).

Likewise, it is clear that infants could use the phonotactic regularities of their languages, such as the fact that English words cannot begin with gd, to avoid erroneous segmentations such as bi gdog (e.g., Brent & Cartwright, in press).

Reference-contexts: Brent, Lexical acquisition and lexical access 3 On-line Segmentation using a Lexicon..There has also been work on segmentation by researchers interested in on-line lexical access during continuous speech recognition. This work includes two well-known connectionist models: TRACE <ref> (McClelland & Elman, 1986) </ref> and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). In these models, segmentation of utterances results from the recognition of familiar words. I refer to this as the lexical approach to segmentation. <p> For example, it does not predict how people determine the most likely completion of the current partial word. Two models that do make predictions the time course of lexical activation during on-line segmentation are TRACE <ref> (McClelland & Elman, 1986) </ref> and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). In one form or another, each of these models maintains an explicit "activation level" for individual words, including potential completions of currently incoming partial words.
