Reference-contexts: In [Ajt90], Ajtai showed that N P M n does not have polynomial-sized, bounded-depth Frege proofs, even in this stronger system. The structure of Ajtai's argument extends the proof technique in his superpolynomial lower bound for the P HP <ref> [Ajt88] </ref>. He first sketches a restriction lemma giving small `covering sets' for formulas over the matching variables. Then, in the novel part of the paper, he shows how the restrictions cannot have falsified the P HP axioms.

Reference-contexts: proofs of N P M n . (A proof of Urquhart [Urq87] shows that N P M n , like P HP n , does have a polynomial size Frege proof of logarithmic depth.) This suggests the following question: is the matching principle strictly stronger than the pigeonhole principle? Ajtai <ref> [Ajt90] </ref> was the first to show that, in a precise sense, the matching principle is stronger than the pigeonhole principle. One can generalize the pigeonhole principle by allowing each variable in the P HP formula to represent an arbitrary formula over some underlying set of propositional variables. <p> Now consider a bounded-depth Frege proof system, with underlying matching variables P fi;jg , where the system is strengthened by allowing all bounded-depth instances of the P HP as axioms. In <ref> [Ajt90] </ref>, Ajtai showed that N P M n does not have polynomial-sized, bounded-depth Frege proofs, even in this stronger system. The structure of Ajtai's argument extends the proof technique in his superpolynomial lower bound for the P HP [Ajt88]. <p> The 2 Excluded Middle Axiom: A _ :A Weakening Rule: A Cut Rule: (A _ B); (:A _ C) Merging Rule: W W W Unmerging Rule: W W W structure of this argument is similar to Ajtai's: As in <ref> [Ajt90] </ref> we use a bit-wise encoding of the P HP formulas to obtain small descriptions of what happens to each pigeon or hole. In our case, rather than small covering sets we use small height matching decision trees along the lines of [BIK + 92, PBI].

Reference-contexts: For every K D, there exists a restriction, 2 P roj D [K] such that d D (f ) jj + d D (f ): Proof: The proof is very similar to that of Beame and H-astad <ref> [BH89] </ref>. Fix K D. We start with the complete matching tree for K. As noted above the paths of this tree correspond exactly to elements of P roj D [K]. Let v be the leaf node corresponding to the path labelled by 2 P roj D [K].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, it has been shown that the propositional pigeonhole principle requires exponential-size, bounded-depth Frege proofs <ref> [BIK + 92, KPW91, PBI] </ref>. <p> Expressed propositionally, the onto version of P HP has additional terms which imply that the function is also surjective. The recent exponential size lower bound for bounded-depth Frege proofs of the onto version of P HP <ref> [BIK + 92] </ref> thus also establishes an exponential size lower bound for bounded-depth Frege proofs of N P M n . (A proof of Urquhart [Urq87] shows that N P M n , like P HP n , does have a polynomial size Frege proof of logarithmic depth.) This suggests the <p> This last piece forms the bulk of the paper and uses a somewhat involved counting argument. In this paper, we present a new proof and we improve the lower bound from super-polynomial to exponential. This result uses the proof-theoretic methods from <ref> [BIK + 92, BPU91, KPW91] </ref> and a modification of the switching lemma from [BIK + 92, PBI]. The most difficult new part of this proof is showing that each restricted P HP axiom is converted to an approximation of a true formula after the various conversions are made. <p> In this paper, we present a new proof and we improve the lower bound from super-polynomial to exponential. This result uses the proof-theoretic methods from [BIK + 92, BPU91, KPW91] and a modification of the switching lemma from <ref> [BIK + 92, PBI] </ref>. The most difficult new part of this proof is showing that each restricted P HP axiom is converted to an approximation of a true formula after the various conversions are made. <p> In our case, rather than small covering sets we use small height matching decision trees along the lines of <ref> [BIK + 92, PBI] </ref>. This difference is fortuitous because it turns out that this permits a much simpler counting argument to show that it is impossible for the con verted subformulas of the P HP axiom to locally describe a 1-1 function and be globally consistent. <p> We note that, independent of this work, Soren Riis (private communication) has shown similar results using methods of nonstandard model theory. 2 The Proof System H + P H P b (F ) The proof system we use is based on the Frege proof system H from <ref> [BPU91, PBI, BIK + 92] </ref> augmented with an axiom schema P HP b (F ) which we describe below. <p> These are entirely analogous to those in <ref> [BIK + 92, PBI] </ref> but we include them for definiteness. The variables over D are fP fi;jg : i 6= j 2 Dg. The i and j will be called the endpoints of P fi;jg . <p> The proof of the Switching Lemma is given in section 6. 4 Exponential Lower Bounds The overall structure of the exponential lower bound argument is very similar to the argument in [KPW91] and in <ref> [BIK + 92] </ref>. <p> This is the subject of section 5. There are some formal and technical differences from <ref> [BIK + 92, PBI] </ref> in how we apply the depth reduction in our argument. First of all, for convenience, we maintain a proof with small height matching decision trees at the leaves rather than formulas and finish reduction when each formula is a small height matching decision tree. <p> There are significant complications however in dealing with partial matching restrictions as opposed to fully independent ones. These complications are similar to those that occured in <ref> [BIK + 92, PBI] </ref> where the domain of inputs was bipartite graphs. We obtain Lemma 3 from the somewhat stronger Lemma 23 by conditioning on some arbitrary function F being forced to 0 and on some arbitrary map Q that is disjoint from f being entirely unset.

Reference-contexts: The lemma which shows this latter result, is of independent interest. In particular, in <ref> [BP93a] </ref>, we use it to demonstrate oracle separations between certain complexity classes of search problems: between classes P P A and P P AD and between classes P P A and P P P .

Reference-contexts: Frege system with NOT gates and unbounded fan-in OR gates (see figure 1.) Excluded middle is the only axiom of H, and the cut rule is the main rule of inference, with extra 3 merging and unmerging rules to manipulate the unbounded fan-in OR's. (By methods of Cook and Reckhow <ref> [CR77] </ref> the exact choice of the constant depth Frege system over unbounded fan-in ^, _, and : we use is not crucial.) We now describe the axiom schema P HP b (F ).

Reference-contexts: Note that if T represents f over D then the tree T c obtained by switching the 1's and 0's labelling the leaves of T represents :f . The lemma in the next section actually is a switching lemma in the spirit of <ref> [H-as87] </ref> because it will allow us to obtain a map disjunction that approximates the negation of f by representing f by a matching decision tree T and then taking maps (T c ). Where it is convenient, we shall assume that an ordering is given on D. <p> If s 0 and pn (r + s)(2r + 2s + 1) then P r [ffi (f ) s] &lt; ff s ; where ff &gt; 0 satisfies (1 + 225p 4 n 3 =ff 2 ) r = 2. The proof of the switching lemma, like that of <ref> [H-as87] </ref>, proceeds by induction on the number of clauses in f .
