Abstract: We consider small-weight Cutting Planes (CP fl ) proofs; that is, Cutting Planes (CP ) proofs with coefficients up to P oly(n). We use the well known lower bounds for monotone complexity to prove an exponential lower bound for the length of CP fl proofs, for a family of tautologies based on the clique function. Because Resolution is a special case of small-weight CP , our method also gives a new and simpler exponential lower bound for Resolution. We also prove the following two theorems : (1) Tree-like CP fl proofs cannot polynomially simulate non-tree-like CP fl proofs. (2) Tree-like CP fl proofs and Bounded-depth-Frege proofs cannot polynomially simulate each other. Our proofs also work for some generalizations of the CP fl proof system. In particular, they work for CP fl with a deduction rule, and also for proof systems that allow any formula with small communication complexity, and any set of sound rules of inference.

Reference-contexts: To prove our lower bound, we show how to extract a small monotone circuit computing clique on many inputs, from a small CP fl proof. The lower bound for CP fl then follows using known monotone lower bounds for the clique function [Razb1], <ref> [AB] </ref>. This lower bound method can be viewed as an extension of the method in [IPU]. 1 We also show how our lower bound method can be applied to obtain exponential lower bounds for several generalizations of CP fl . <p> in the more general setting where the inferences take up to some fixed constant number of formulas to a single formula. (In the above definition, we have fixed the constant to be 2.) 3 Methods and Results In this paper, we will use the well-known lower bounds for monotone complexity <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref> to prove lower bounds for the length of CP fl proofs. Our result is inspired by the result of [IPU], who prove an exponential lower bound for the length of tree-like CP proofs, for some tautology. Below we give the main ideas of their proof. <p> We take the sets A; B of minterms and maxterms of f that were previously considered in <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref>. We form a tautology T (A; B) expressing the fact that if x 2 A describes a minterm, and y 2 B describes a max-term, then for some i, x i = 1 and y i = 0. <p> Then using our main result together with known lower bounds for the monotone complexity of the clique function <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref>, we obtain exponential lower bounds for the size of any CP fl proof for T (A; B). We remark that the proof actually works for coefficients up to O (2 n * ). <p> we use the clique-based tautology rather than the tautology used in [IPU] only because the monotone circuit lower bounds are stronger for the clique function. 4 Lower bounds for CP fl In this section, we are going to use the lower bound for the monotone complexity of the clique function <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref> to obtain a lower bound for a certain clique tautology in small-weights Cutting Planes. A graph G x on n vertices is called a k-clique if G x consists of a single clique of size k, and no other edges. <p> The graph G y is a maxterm of the clique function because G y does not contain a k-clique, but if any edge is added, then there will be a k-clique. The lower bound in <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref> is very strong. It says that for some k, every monotone circuit separating k-cliques from (k 1)-cocliques requires exponential size. <p> Definition 4.1: A monotone boolean function Q n;k is called a clique separator if it interprets the inputs as the edges of a graph on n vertices, and outputs 1 on an input representing a k-clique, and 0 on an input representing a (k 1)-coclique. Theorem 1: <ref> [Razb1, AB] </ref> For k = n 2=3 , any monotone boolean circuit that computes a clique separator Q n;k re quires size (2 (n= log n) 1=3 ).

Reference-contexts: This is because the clique tautology has a polynomial size Frege proof. Let us show this. We will do it by reducing :CLIQU E n;k to the negation of the pigeonhole principle. Since Buss <ref> [B] </ref> showed that the pigeonhole principle has polynomial size Frege proofs, CLIQU E n;k must also have polynomial size Frege proofs. Let us show now the reduction of :CLIQU E n;k to the negation of the pigeonhole principle.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the propositional pigeonhole principle (P HP ) has a very simple polynomial-size CP proof [CCT]. This is interesting because P HP is the canonical hard tautology that has been previously used to prove lower bounds for Resolution as well as for bounded-depth Frege systems (e.g., [H], <ref> [BIKPPW] </ref>.) Since P HP has a short CP proof, CP is strictly stronger than Resolution (with respect to what can be proven by polynomial-size proofs.) It was shown in [G] that any Frege system can polynomially simulate CP , and therefore CP lies between Resolution and Frege.

Reference-contexts: 2 = O (log n (log log n) 2 ), and the error is at most O (log n)=O (log n 2 ) 1=4. 2 To complete the proof of the lower bound, we will need the following lower bound due to Raz and Wigderson [RW1] (see also [Raz], and <ref> [BL] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: lower bounds have been given only for weaker systems. fl Research supported by an NSF postdoctoral fellowship and by NSF Grant CCR-9457782 y Part of this work was done while the author was a postdoc at Princeton University and DIMACS The Cutting Planes (CP ) proof system, first introduced in <ref> [CCT] </ref>, is a sound and complete refutation system for proving the unsatisfiability of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form. It is based on showing that there are no integral solutions for a family of linear inequalities associated with an unsatisfiable CN F formula. <p> Besides being a very natural proof system, CP appears to be relatively powerful. First, it is a natural generalization of Resolution. Secondly, the propositional pigeonhole principle (P HP ) has a very simple polynomial-size CP proof <ref> [CCT] </ref>. <p> For a more complete treatment see <ref> [C, G, CCT] </ref>. <p> Division of an inequality by an integer: if P n i=1 a i x i A, and c 2 Z divides each a i we can derive n X a i x i A m As introduced in <ref> [CCT] </ref>, the CP system can be used as a refutation system for CN F formulas : Given a CN F formula, f , in the variables x 1 ; : : : ; x n , we think of the variables x 1 ; : : : ; x n as <p> A CP refutation of f (or E (f )) is a CP proof for the inequality 0 1, from the initial family E (f ). It was proved in <ref> [CCT] </ref> that CP is a sound and complete refutation system for CN F formulas. Clearly, by looking at :f , CP is a sound and complete proof system for DN F formulas. This result can also be derived by noticing that CP is in fact a generalization of Resolution. <p> Definition 2.1: The length of a CP proof is the number of formulas in it. The size of the proof is the number of binary symbols needed to write down the proof. It was shown in <ref> [CCT] </ref> that any CP proof can be converted into a new one, such that the lengths of all the coefficients in the new proof, and the length of the new proof, are all polynomially bounded, in the length of the original proof. <p> Therefore without loss of generality, we can assume that the length and the size of a CP proof are polynomially equivalent, and will not distinguish between them in this paper. How large can the coefficients in the proof be? By <ref> [CCT] </ref>, we can assume without loss of generality that all of the coefficients are smaller than 2 P oly (l) , where l is the length of the proof.

Reference-contexts: It is believed that for any conceivable proof system there exist tautologies (of size n), with no proofs of size polynomial in n. However, proving this for every conceivable system is equivalent to proving that N P 6= Co N P <ref> [CR] </ref>, which is an extremely hard task. Therefore, many researchers have concentrated on proving the existence of hard tautologies (i.e. tautologies with no polynomial size proofs), for specific natural classes of proof systems.

In particular, <ref> [IPU] </ref> took f to be the monotone boolean function that interprets the inputs as an undirected graph of n = 3k vertices, and outputs 1 if and only if the graph contains a matching of size k. <p> This result combined with a new upper bound will give us a separation between CP fl and tree-like CP fl . Can the same be done for non-tree-like proofs? The main result of this paper generalizes the result of <ref> [IPU] </ref> to the non-tree-like case. We show directly how to translate any CP fl proof for T (A; B) into a monotone boolean circuit that separates the sets A and B. <p> We remark that the proof actually works for coefficients up to O (2 n * ). We also remark that we use the clique-based tautology rather than the tautology used in <ref> [IPU] </ref> only because the monotone circuit lower bounds are stronger for the clique function. 4 Lower bounds for CP fl In this section, we are going to use the lower bound for the monotone complexity of the clique function [Razb1, AB] to obtain a lower bound for a certain clique tautology <p> This is not as obvious as the bounded-depth Frege proof, but follows along similar lines. Lastly, we derive lower bounds for tree-like CP fl proofs of ST CON N l n , using the method in <ref> [IPU] </ref>. 5.1 Bounded-depth Frege proofs of ST CON N l n Small size bounded-depth Frege refutations of :ST CON N l n are quite natural. <p> Theorem 10: For l = n 1=150 , any tree-like CP fl refuta tion of :ST CON N l n requires superpolynomial size. The above theorem is an application of the method in <ref> [IPU] </ref>. As a corollary we have the following theorems. Theorem 11: Bounded-depth Frege cannot be p-simulated by small-weight, tree-like Cutting Planes. Theorem 12: Small-weight Cutting Planes cannot be p-simulated by small-weight tree-like Cutting Planes. <p> By Lemma 3 of <ref> [IPU] </ref>, a tree-like CP refutation of size S for :ST CON N l n with polynomial weights gives rise to a threshold decision tree, T , for the associated search problem of depth O (log S), and where all threshold formulas in the tree have polynomial-size weights. <p> We will now describe how to construct a communication complexity protocol, P , for F indedge (l; n) from T where at most O (log n (log log n) 2 ) bits are sent, and the error is at most 1=4. As in Lemma 5 of <ref> [IPU] </ref>, the two players will proceed in log S rounds, at each step evaluating the threshold formula and proceeding on the consistent subtree of half the size.

Reference-contexts: Given a monotone boolean function, f , a minterm x of f , and a maxterm y of f , there must be at least one coordinate i, such that x i = 1, and y i = 0. This simple fact inspired <ref> [KW] </ref> to define the following communication search problem: Assume that A is a subset of minterms of a monotone boolean function f , and B is a subset of maxterms of the same function f . <p> Player I gets a minterm x 2 A, Player II gets a maxterm y 2 B, and their goal is to find a coordinate i, with x i = 1 and y i = 0 (the sets A and B are known to both players). Karchmer and Wigderson <ref> [KW] </ref> proved that if A is the set of all the minterms of f , and B is the set of all the maxterms of f , then the communication complexity of the corresponding search problem is exactly equal to the monotone circuit depth of the function f .

One obvious open problem is to extend our lower bound to the Cutting Planes proof system with unrestricted weights.
