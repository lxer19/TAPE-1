Abstract: In this paper we reconsider the notion of value in the context of Information Technology (IT), and show how the introduction of new IT can change values in organisations. Subsequently we introduce the notion of Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) as autonomous, social, reactive, proactive and subservient software computer systems. W e further look at how the introduction of ISAs to knowledge-intensive industries can help human agents in their understanding of the development of new values while the new IT is taking place in their workplaces, and how the already existing values in the organisation can be dealt with at the same time.

Reference-contexts: Social norms defining the acceptable or appropriate ways to behave and opinions to hold make the boundaries within which we acquire and develop our behaviour and behavioural patterns. Without these norms, we simply cannot maintain our ways of communication, which are in the core of our existence as species <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>. <p> Although different research groups have different ideas of what exactly these features are and how they should be developed in the agents, there seems to be an agreement among almost all of these groups on which features agents, at least, must have. As we have seen in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>, they have to be: Autonomous Social Reactive Proactive Subservient An ISA is autonomous if it can operate without neither direct human interference nor any interference from other agents working in the same environment. It should also have control over its own actions, plans and internal states. <p> Thus it starts by looking in the bibliographic databases that it has access to in order to find an article or technical report by Ms. Williams. It knows that if it finds the article it will have the name and/or address of the institution <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>. ISAs as support systems Now it should be obvious that ISAs such as Softbots can help knowledge workers in organisations when facing problems as Information anxiety (IA). <p> By introducing Softbot, many of the symptoms of the IA such as losing the confidence in him/herself, decreasing in efficiency and so on disappear. 4 For more examples, look at <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>. Automatic filtering of electronic mail and news, sending routine messages such as meeting reminders or talk announcements, and negotiating a meeting time with others are some other tasks causing IA. ISAs can also help employees to control these situations. In (Abolfazlian, 1996a) we have shown some examples of the <p> on disappear. 4 For more examples, look at <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>. Automatic filtering of electronic mail and news, sending routine messages such as meeting reminders or talk announcements, and negotiating a meeting time with others are some other tasks causing IA. ISAs can also help employees to control these situations. In (Abolfazlian, 1996a) we have shown some examples of the ISAs already solving many of these problems.

Reference-contexts: Let us now briefly look at an example of these Intelligent Software Agents 4 Softbots The Softbot (Software Robot) is an ISA running on the internet <ref> (Etzioni et.al, 1994) </ref>. It is a fully implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI) device running on UNIX operating system. The softbot interacts with its environment, specially different internet resources, through a UNIX shell and the World Wide Web (WWW).

Reference-contexts: We call them psychological tools or instruments: Psychological tools are artificial formations. By their nature they are social, not organic or individual. They are directed toward the mastery or control of behavioural processes.....just as technical means are directed toward the control of processes of nature <ref> (Vygotsky, 1979) </ref>. Natural languages, algebraic symbol systems, schemes, diagrams, mechanical drawings and different aspects of IT are some examples of psychological instruments. By using these instruments and making them part of our behavioural processes, they alter the entire flow and structure of mental functions.
