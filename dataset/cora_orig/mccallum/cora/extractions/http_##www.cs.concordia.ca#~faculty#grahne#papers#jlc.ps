Abstract: We study the problem of combining updates |a special instance of theory change| and counterfactual conditionals in propositional knowledgebases. Intuitively, an update means that the world described by the knowledgebase has changed. This is opposed to revisions |another instance of theory change| where our knowledge about a static world changes. A counterfactual implication is a statement of the form `If A were the case, then B would also be the case', where the negation of A may be derivable from our current knowledge. We present a decidable logic, called VCU 2 , that has both update and counterfactual implication as connectives in the object language. Our update operator is a generalization of operators previously proposed and studied in the literature. We show that our operator satisfies certain postulates set forth for any reasonable update. The logic VCU 2 is an extension of D. K. Lewis' logic VCU for counterfactual conditionals. The semantics of VCU 2 is that of a multimodal propositional calculus, and is based on possible worlds. The infamous Ramsey Rule becomes a derivation rule in our sound and complete axiomatization. We then show that Gardenfors' Triviality Theorem, about the impossibility to combine theory change and counterfactual conditionals via the Ramsey Rule, does not hold in our logic. It is thus seen that the Triviality Theorem applies only to revision operators, not to updates. fl A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the Second International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 22-25, 1991. The work was partially performed while the author was visiting the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Reference-contexts: Changes of the former kind are called revisions by Katsuno and Mendelzon [24], whereas the latter type is given the name updates in that same paper. 1 Gardenfors and his colleagues <ref> [2] </ref> have set forth a set of rationality postulates for revision operations. Katsuno and Mendelzon have done the same for update operations [24]. Now Gardenfors' triviality result holds for the case where the change function satisfies certain (weakened) postulates for revision. <p> As we shall see, a change operator can either be a meta level mapping, or an object language connective. Gardenfors and his colleagues have set forth a set rationality postulates that any reasonable revision operator should satisfy <ref> [2] </ref>. This approach studies revisions as mappings between abstract structures called `belief sets'. In particular, belief sets can be infinite. The postulates are then conditions on the mappings, and as such, formalizations of our rationality. <p> Note that consistent (unqualified) means consistent in VCU 2 , and that ` means the same as ` VCU 2 . Then, let P be the set of all truth-functional tautologies. The postulates by Gardenfors et al <ref> [2] </ref> for the mapping ffi as a revision function are then the following: (R1) ` P ffi ! (R2) If ^ is consistent in P, then ` P ( ffi ) $ ( ^ ). (R3) If is consistent in P, then ffi is also consistent in P. (R4) If ` <p> Postulate (R4) assures that the result of the revision is independent of the syntax for the knowledgebase and the new sentence . For an intuitive account of the rest of the postulates, see <ref> [2] </ref>. The crucial postulate is (R2). It is precisely this postulate that is incompatible with the Ramsey Rule, and which is the major distinction between revisions from updates.

Reference-contexts: The works by Makinson [29] and Cross [8] consider the case where the inference operator is non-monotonic, instead of the classical one, but Makinson shows that the triviality theorem holds for all reasonable inference operators.

Reference-contexts: Such adaptions are called updates. To highlight the distinction between the two change operators, we borrow an example from J. Biskup <ref> [4] </ref>, who studies the problem of updating relational databases containing `null values': Suppose that a database contains information about parts in the stock of some enterprise, and that the current state of the database is `there are balls of an unknown color in the stock'.

Reference-contexts: The application of counterfactuals to knowledgebases lies in their ability to express rules of the form `If A, then B ', and questions of the form `What if A', where the negation of A may be derivable from the knowledgebase. Among others, Bonner <ref> [5] </ref> studies a database query language with a What if-capability. Ginsberg [17] describes a large number of AI applications of counterfactuals. So far, we have looked at one side of the coin.

Reference-contexts: In the sequel we will lean on the properties of maximally consistent sets of sentences, such as ^ 2 iff 2 and 2 , and if ` then 2 , etc (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: It turns out that all three types of models define the same class of valid sentences (Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 below). Pre-orders have mainly been used to model updates (cf. [22, 23, 24]), while selection functions form the main semantic apparatus for interpreting conditionals (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). Spheres have been used by Lewis [27] and by Grove [19] to model counterfactuals and revisions, respectively. All three classes of models will also (implicitly or explicitly) have an accessibility relation (as in Kripke models). <p> Thus i 2 [[]], and consequently [[]] = I: 2 Selection Models In the literature on counterfactuals, the semantics of the &gt;-connective is often given with the use of selection functions (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>). We shall do so here also, and we will show the correspondence between order and sphere models and models that are based on selection functions.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Rott [32] has tried to forbid iterated counterfactuals while allowing (non-iterated) counterfactuals in the knowledgebase, and concluded that the triviality result still stands. The works by Makinson [29] and Cross <ref> [8] </ref> consider the case where the inference operator is non-monotonic, instead of the classical one, but Makinson shows that the triviality theorem holds for all reasonable inference operators.

Reference-contexts: The Ramsey Rule is summarized by Gardenfors [15] as follows: Accept a proposition of the form `if A, then B ' in a state of belief [or knowledge] K, if and only if the minimal change of K needed to accept A, also requires accepting B. Gardenfors <ref> [13, 15] </ref> has shown that with certain assumptions on the change operation, such operations are incompatible with the Ramsey Rule, meaning that any logic containing the two is trivial (in a sense to be defined later). <p> This result is known as the Gardenfors Triviality Theorem. Many solutions have been sought to the dilemma of the theorem. Gardenfors <ref> [13] </ref> considers weaker versions of the Ramsey Rule, but concludes that these versions do not satisfy our intuition. A more promising direction, where counterfactual If-then-rules are forbidden in the knowledgebase, is taken by Levi [26]. <p> The works by Makinson [29] and Cross [8] consider the case where the inference operator is non-monotonic, instead of the classical one, but Makinson shows that the triviality theorem holds for all reasonable inference operators. Finally, Gardenfors <ref> [13] </ref> and Arlo Costa [3] show that weakening the assumptions on the change operator does not provide a way out of the dilemma. As pointed out in e.g. [1, 24, 25], there are however two fundamentally different ways of changing knowledge. <p> Our formalism is that of a multimodal propositional logic. Neither operation is taken as more primitive than the other, and both are connectives in the object language (in contrast to e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>, where the revision operator appears on the level of models). The interpretation of the update connective is a generalization of a `possible models approach' previously proposed and studied in the literature. The interpretation of the counterfactual connective is the one associated with D. K. <p> non-monotonic in the sense that if ` ! ; then it does not necessarily follow that ` ffi ! : A Non-Triviality Result Gardenfors has shown that any logic with the Ramsey Rule and with a change connective satisfying postulates (R1), (R2) and (R3) is trivial in a certain sense <ref> [13, 15] </ref>. Gardenfors shows his theorem in the context of belief sets, but we shall rephrase and reprove it in the current formalism. In the following we assume that all logics include the truth functional tautologies. We shall also need the following auxiliary result.

Reference-contexts: In this setting, we obviously restrict ourselves to updating finite (or finitely axiomatizable) theories. We do not however regard this as a serious restriction, since any knowledgebase that is to be used in practice is inherently finite. The two formalizations of change operators are evidently intertwined. Gardenfors <ref> [14] </ref> shows how to construct a system of belief set from a selection model (without the condition for the ffi-connective). As we shall see below, the conditions on a change operator become theorems and metatheorems in the logic having change as a connective. Then to the rationality postulates themselves.

Reference-contexts: The notion of minimal change also plays a role in defining the meaning of counterfac-tual implications. This is explicitly expressed in the Ramsey Rule [31]. The Ramsey Rule is summarized by Gardenfors <ref> [15] </ref> as follows: Accept a proposition of the form `if A, then B ' in a state of belief [or knowledge] K, if and only if the minimal change of K needed to accept A, also requires accepting B. <p> The Ramsey Rule is summarized by Gardenfors [15] as follows: Accept a proposition of the form `if A, then B ' in a state of belief [or knowledge] K, if and only if the minimal change of K needed to accept A, also requires accepting B.

Reference-contexts: Our revised description of the world 3 Note that nothing (except perhaps bounded computational resources) prevents neither the knowledge base, nor the sentence to contain the ffi and &gt; connectives in an arbitrary (well-formed) combination. 4 In the words of J. Hintikka <ref> [21] </ref>, `one has to keep an eye on more than one possible world'. 4 of interest will then have to take this into account, in that the set it now describes either contains less (expansion of knowledge) or more (contractionof knowledge) possible worlds.

Reference-contexts: There is though a quite substantial body of work on this problem, both in the fields of AI and databases, as well as in the field of logic. (For some overviews, the reader should turn to <ref> [23, 28, 35] </ref>.) A generic name for the problem is theory change. The agreement on theory change is that in the case of contradictions, `as little as possible' of the old theory should be changed in order to accommodate the new facts, that is, the change should be minimal. <p> It turns out that all three types of models define the same class of valid sentences (Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 below). Pre-orders have mainly been used to model updates (cf. <ref> [22, 23, 24] </ref>), while selection functions form the main semantic apparatus for interpreting conditionals (cf. [7]).

Consider the following example from the domain of artificial intelligence <ref> [23] </ref> (cf. also [33, 34]): A room has two objects in it, a book and a magazine. Suppose p 1 means that the book is on the floor, and p 2 means that the magazine is on the floor.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Gardenfors [13] and Arlo Costa [3] show that weakening the assumptions on the change operator does not provide a way out of the dilemma. As pointed out in e.g. <ref> [1, 24, 25] </ref>, there are however two fundamentally different ways of changing knowledge. One can regard the new evidence as contributing to our knowledge about the real world (e.g. the butler is guilty). <p> On the other hand, the evidence can reflect a change in the real world (e.g. the master of the house has been murdered). Changes of the former kind are called revisions by Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [24] </ref>, whereas the latter type is given the name updates in that same paper. 1 Gardenfors and his colleagues [2] have set forth a set of rationality postulates for revision operations. Katsuno and Mendelzon have done the same for update operations [24]. <p> former kind are called revisions by Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [24] </ref>, whereas the latter type is given the name updates in that same paper. 1 Gardenfors and his colleagues [2] have set forth a set of rationality postulates for revision operations. Katsuno and Mendelzon have done the same for update operations [24]. Now Gardenfors' triviality result holds for the case where the change function satisfies certain (weakened) postulates for revision. In this paper we study the problem of combining updates (as opposed to revisions) and counterfactuals via the Ramsey Rule. Our formalism is that of a multimodal propositional logic. <p> The resulting logic, called VCU 2 , of counterfactu-als and updates is decidable. We also show that the update postulates of Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [24] </ref> are theorems or metatheorems in this logic. Finally, we show that the Gardenfors Triviality Theorem does not hold in VCU 2 . 1 Keller and Winslett [25] use the terms knowledge adding and change recording, instead of revision and update. 2 VCU stands for variably strict conditionals with universality. <p> It turns out that all three types of models define the same class of valid sentences (Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 below). Pre-orders have mainly been used to model updates (cf. <ref> [22, 23, 24] </ref>), while selection functions form the main semantic apparatus for interpreting conditionals (cf. [7]).

For other examples of revisions vs. updates, see <ref> [24, 33] </ref>. Another fundamental distinction can be seen in the way different works models theory change. As we shall see, a change operator can either be a meta level mapping, or an object language connective. <p> In determining a set of appropriate postulates for an update function, we have seen that (R2) cannot be used. The set of postulates for the mapping ffi as an update functions are then (R1), (R4), (R5) and (U1) - (U5) below <ref> [24] </ref>: (U1) If ` P ! , then ` P ( ffi ) $ . (U2) If both and are consistent in P, then ffi is also consistent in P.

This direction is pursued in [18]. Acknowledgements The connection between counterfactuals and updates was first recognized in <ref> [24] </ref>. Without the numerous discussions the present author had with Alberto Mendelzon, this paper would not have been possible.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Gardenfors [13] and Arlo Costa [3] show that weakening the assumptions on the change operator does not provide a way out of the dilemma. As pointed out in e.g. <ref> [1, 24, 25] </ref>, there are however two fundamentally different ways of changing knowledge. One can regard the new evidence as contributing to our knowledge about the real world (e.g. the butler is guilty). <p> We also show that the update postulates of Katsuno and Mendelzon [24] are theorems or metatheorems in this logic. Finally, we show that the Gardenfors Triviality Theorem does not hold in VCU 2 . 1 Keller and Winslett <ref> [25] </ref> use the terms knowledge adding and change recording, instead of revision and update. 2 VCU stands for variably strict conditionals with universality. Strict conditionals are of the form necessarily p implies q.

Reference-contexts: Many solutions have been sought to the dilemma of the theorem. Gardenfors [13] considers weaker versions of the Ramsey Rule, but concludes that these versions do not satisfy our intuition. A more promising direction, where counterfactual If-then-rules are forbidden in the knowledgebase, is taken by Levi <ref> [26] </ref>. By going in this direction we however lose the expressive power of the knowledgebase, as well as the power to express iterated counterfactuals, that is rules of the form If (If A, then B), then C.

Reference-contexts: The interpretation of the update connective is a generalization of a `possible models approach' previously proposed and studied in the literature. The interpretation of the counterfactual connective is the one associated with D. K. Lewis' logic VCU <ref> [27] </ref>. 2 It turns out that the logic characterized by this combined class of interpretations is obtained by adding the Ramsey Rule as a derivation rule to an axiomatization of Lewis' logic VCU. The resulting logic, called VCU 2 , of counterfactu-als and updates is decidable. <p> The meaning of a counterfactual, such as `If kangaroos had no tails, they would topple over ', is that in any possible world in which kangaroos have no tails, and which resembles our own as much as possible otherwise, kangaroos would topple over <ref> [27] </ref>. Thus the worlds where a counterfactual &gt; is true are the worlds were the closest worlds in which is true also have as true. <p> Pre-orders have mainly been used to model updates (cf. [22, 23, 24]), while selection functions form the main semantic apparatus for interpreting conditionals (cf. [7]). Spheres have been used by Lewis <ref> [27] </ref> and by Grove [19] to model counterfactuals and revisions, respectively. All three classes of models will also (implicitly or explicitly) have an accessibility relation (as in Kripke models). <p> A discussion of condition (O3) can be found in <ref> [27, 30] </ref>. 8 The conditions (V1) - (V3) state the usual Boolean semantics for the truth-functional connectives. Condition (V4) says that i is a &gt; -world iff all closest accessible -worlds also are -worlds. Consequently, a counterfactual &gt; can be vacuously true at a world i. <p> For all i 2 I; [$ i = I: Here the nomenclature is locally uniform sphere models, resp. universal sphere models. We are now in a position to show the following lemma (cf modal logic S5), extending a corresponding result by Lewis <ref> [27] </ref> to models for sentences with the ffi-connective. Lemma 3.1 Let be a sentence. <p> Model Equivalence We shall now turn our attention to the correspondence between the three different classes of models. Call two models equivalent if they have the same set of worlds, and if the valuation function is the same in both. The following two theorems extend results by Lewis <ref> [27] </ref> to locally uniform and universal models, and to models of sentences with the ffi-connective. Theorem 3.1 For any (locally uniform, universal) order model there is an equivalent (locally uniform, universal) sphere model, and vice versa. Proof. Let I =&lt; I; $; [[]] &gt; be a sphere model.

(For some overviews, the reader should turn to <ref> [23, 28, 35] </ref>.) A generic name for the problem is theory change. The agreement on theory change is that in the case of contradictions, `as little as possible' of the old theory should be changed in order to accommodate the new facts, that is, the change should be minimal.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Rott [32] has tried to forbid iterated counterfactuals while allowing (non-iterated) counterfactuals in the knowledgebase, and concluded that the triviality result still stands. The works by Makinson <ref> [29] </ref> and Cross [8] consider the case where the inference operator is non-monotonic, instead of the classical one, but Makinson shows that the triviality theorem holds for all reasonable inference operators.

Reference-contexts: Much work in logic has been devoted to conditionals, that is, implications other than the material one. (For an overview of the field, see <ref> [30] </ref>.) A counterfactual conditional, or counterfactual for short, is a statement of the form `if A, then B ', where, as the name indicates, the premise A can contradict the current state of affairs, or our current knowledge thereof. <p> A discussion of condition (O3) can be found in <ref> [27, 30] </ref>. 8 The conditions (V1) - (V3) state the usual Boolean semantics for the truth-functional connectives.

Reference-contexts: The notion of minimal change also plays a role in defining the meaning of counterfac-tual implications. This is explicitly expressed in the Ramsey Rule <ref> [31] </ref>. The Ramsey Rule is summarized by Gardenfors [15] as follows: Accept a proposition of the form `if A, then B ' in a state of belief [or knowledge] K, if and only if the minimal change of K needed to accept A, also requires accepting B.

Reference-contexts: Then the resulting database should represent the facts that there are white balls in the stock, and also balls of an unknown color, possibly white, possibly some other color. For other examples of revisions vs. updates, see <ref> [24, 33] </ref>. Another fundamental distinction can be seen in the way different works models theory change. As we shall see, a change operator can either be a meta level mapping, or an object language connective. <p> But the situation for updates is different. Consider the following example from the domain of artificial intelligence [23] (cf. also <ref> [33, 34] </ref>): A room has two objects in it, a book and a magazine. Suppose p 1 means that the book is on the floor, and p 2 means that the magazine is on the floor.

For each model M of T , choose those models of that are closest to M. The result is then the theory of the union of all separate updates.
