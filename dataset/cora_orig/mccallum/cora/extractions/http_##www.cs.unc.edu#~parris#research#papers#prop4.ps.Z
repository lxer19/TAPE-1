Title: A Router-Based Congestion Control Scheme For Real-Time Continuous Media

Degree: (Dissertation Proposal)  Administrative Issues Dissertation Committee  
Abstract: This dissertation focuses on supporting the real-time transmission of continuous media over heterogeneous networks. Resource reservation is an effective solution when a fully QOS-capable connection exists from sender to receiver but many networks can not support reservations. End-to-end adaptations offer good best-effort attempts on networks where reservations are not possible but either degrade the quality of the stream with media scaling or function well only in small homogeneous network (e.g. two-dimensional scaling). Support for real-time continuous media requires addressing varying types of congestion and network conditions along each hop of the network path. I hypothesize that a combination of generic media adaptations placed in the routers of contention-based networks can ameliorate the effects of congestion to provide effective, best-effort, real-time transmission service across large, heterogeneous networks which will perform better than existing end-to-end adaptations and that these adaptations can be realized efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Further, implementing the adaptations at the application layer allows us to take advantage of the properties of the media type (e.g. to perform spatial scaling by converting between video encodings <ref> [Ami95] </ref>). An intermediate possibility is a hybrid approach with general purpose adaptations implemented in the IP layer in the network combined with application level adaptations implemented at the endpoints. <p> For all of these reasons, I intend to base my adaptations in the network layer. 5.2 Crossing Networking Layers Traditional adaptations, even those that may be physically separated from the generation of the frames themselves (e.g. re-encoding in application-level gateways <ref> [Ami95] </ref>) take advantage of their location in the application layer and their resulting knowledge of media encoding and packaging of the frames of the media stream. With this information they can perform a wide variety of adaptations from spatial scaling, chroma scaling, to temporal scaling. <p> Two of the major end-to-end techniques, two-dimensional scaling techniques and elastic queuing, are discussed above in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. <ref> [Ami95] </ref> describes an application level video gateway used to support multicast video. The gateway is placed at the connection between networks with distinctly different levels of performance. The gateway transencodes media streams as the pass onto networks with less bandwidth available.

Reference-contexts: The subnetworks are a physical component of the infrastructure, usually with no programmable component and, subsequently, a high cost of modification. As a result, the suggested changes to the architecture focus on the network elements and, to a lesser extent, the end workstations. 7.2.1.1 Network Elements <ref> [Bak96] </ref> specifies the new or modified components of a network element which contribute to providing integrated services. These elements include the following components: reservation setup, admission control, classifier, and packet scheduler. The reservation setup component of the router receives traffic specification messages as well as reservations for specific flows. <p> While some levels of service may only require some of these to be specified, the parameters include those necessary to define a token bucket model, specifically, rate, burstiness, and delay. [She96], [Wro96], and <ref> [Bak96] </ref> describe three of the service models that the integrated services model will support.

Reference-contexts: In some cases the network technology itself supports reservations. For example, in an ATM [LeB92] network, a virtual circuit can be allocated with guaranteed bandwidth and latency. In other cases, the infrastructure is implemented as part of the network layer. For example, the integrated services architecture <ref> [Cla92] </ref> includes specifications for a reservation system which can operate on a number of different network technologies, from point-to-point links to ATM. In some cases meeting the requested performance bounds is straight forward. <p> Such specifications are a fundamental part of most QOS architectures and the generation of such a specification will be a key part of integrating QOS capable networks with the network-based adaptations I describe.

Reference-contexts: But, if packets were already being delayed due to the access constraint, the overall effect will be decreased latency. A capacity constraint can only be ameliorated by sending less data. This can be accomplished through temporal or spatial scaling <ref> [Del93] </ref>. <p> The paper also includes a good discussion of many types of scaling and their relative merits.

Reference-contexts: However, the cost of unpacking and examining the internal data at the routers would be prohibitively expensive, both in terms of impact on that stream and on the other packets that would be processed in that router. <ref> [Hof93] </ref> attempts to address this problem by proposing an extension to the current transport layer header format to include a tag field which indicates the prioritization of a particular packet within their adaptation scheme. <p> The adaptations are static, not reactive, and used based on the nature of the downstream connections (e.g. a lower bandwidth connection such as a 14.4 Modem) rather than changes in the congestion on the downstream networks. <ref> [Hof93] </ref> offers a more general approach implemented in network elements with no direct awareness of the media semantics. This approach relies on tagged sub-flows which represent different scales of quality where the information necessary to generate the highest quality image is tagged with the lowest priority. <p> This paper also offers an initial framework based on the ideas of transparent scaling which is decoupled from the media semantics and non-transparent scaling which requires knowledge of the media scaling. It also introduces the concepts of discrete scaling (filtering subflows as in <ref> [Hof93] </ref>) vs. continuous scaling (deleting specific packets which have been delayed). However, like [Hof93], they adapt by scaling, reducing the quality of the media stream. Another noteworthy feature of the HeiTS implementation is its integration into a reservation-based system. <p> It also introduces the concepts of discrete scaling (filtering subflows as in <ref> [Hof93] </ref>) vs. continuous scaling (deleting specific packets which have been delayed).

Reference-contexts: It is certainly more complex than assigning each stream an appropriate fraction of the network resources because of the unpredictable fraction taken up by the collisions . DRAFT 9/17/96 4 10:48 AM 2.2 Adaptations Previous work shows that end-to-end adaptations such as elastic queuing <ref> [Sto93] </ref> and two-dimensional media scaling [Tal94] provide effective, best-effort, real-time transmission service across congested campus networks. 2.2.1 Elastic Queuing Because network congestion is stochastic, the delay a packet encounters between the receiver and sender can vary widely. This variance in end-to-end delay is called delay-jitter. <p> However, gaps can be tolerable, even unnoticeable if they are infrequent, just as some amount of latency is acceptable, particularly if the alternative is significant gaps. The problem then becomes to find the minimum amount of buffering that results in a tolerable number of gaps. Elastic queuing <ref> [Sto93] </ref> is an adaptation used to reduce jitter while minimizing the latency incurred. Elastic queuing attempts to manage the tradeoff between jitter and latency by allowing the receivers delay buffer size to grow when jitter exists and by reducing the size of the delay buffer when the network is uncongested. <p> Correspondingly, when the queue must be adjusted when delay jitter increases. Whenever the queue is emptied by the play out it is an indication that the delay buffer is to small and its size must be increased. This technique is describe in more detail in <ref> [Sto93] </ref>. 2.2.2 Two-dimensional Media Scaling One of Talleys primary observations was that congestion in shared media networks can be identified by the way it constrains the traffic streams. There are two types of congestion constraints: access constraints and capacity constraints.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the application can adapt its traffic stream by putting multiple frames of audio or video into a single message, trading some possible increase in latency for bandwidth. These adaptations have been explored by <ref> [Tal94] </ref> and others as part of applications. In this work, I consider placing these types of adaptations into the network itself. Preliminary experiments indicate that placing these adaptations in network routers allows them to address the specific conditions in the local subnetwork . <p> It is certainly more complex than assigning each stream an appropriate fraction of the network resources because of the unpredictable fraction taken up by the collisions . DRAFT 9/17/96 4 10:48 AM 2.2 Adaptations Previous work shows that end-to-end adaptations such as elastic queuing [Sto93] and two-dimensional media scaling <ref> [Tal94] </ref> provide effective, best-effort, real-time transmission service across congested campus networks. 2.2.1 Elastic Queuing Because network congestion is stochastic, the delay a packet encounters between the receiver and sender can vary widely. This variance in end-to-end delay is called delay-jitter. <p> The adaptations also periodically attempt to move back towards packaging of individual units (audio or video frames) at full quality to determine if the congestion has subsided. This algorithm and experimental results are described in detail in <ref> [Tal94] </ref>. Both Talley and Stone showed end-to-end adaptations are effective but they can encounter difficulties dealing with large, heterogeneous networks. Large networks introduce increased latency, not only for the media stream but for the feedback from the receiver to the sender. <p> Different types of congestion require different, sometimes conflicting, adaptations. Finally, because the end-to-end adaptations operate at the application layer rather than the network layer, they often have difficulty identifying the type of congestion present in the network. For example, in <ref> [Tal94] </ref> the algorithm uses feedback from the receiver to recognize poor performance but then the algorithm must explore the set of operating points by applying different adaptations and observing the resulting feedback to determine which adaptation is effective.

Reference-contexts: A good deal of work has been done regarding each of these components. [Fer90a] and [Cam93a] both discuss the components of flow specification. [Zha93,And90,Top90] all present protocols for negotiating resource reservations. [Fer90b] and [Top90] also discuss channel establishment. [Jam92] and [Cha95] consider the problem of admission control. [Dem89], [Par93], <ref> [Zha95] </ref>, and [Zha90] all present packet scheduling algorithms. Consideration of how to deal with routing changes is largely an open problem. I intend to base my flow management, packet classification and general router architecture on the designs generated by the IETF.

Reference-contexts: It is probably most similar to the controlled-load service [Wro96] which attempts to assure that the traffic stream performs as if the network were unloaded. All of these QOS architectures include five basic components, as discussed in <ref> [Zha93] </ref>. They are: flow specification, routing, resource reservation, admission control, and packet scheduling. <p> These elements include the following components: reservation setup, admission control, classifier, and packet scheduler. The reservation setup component of the router receives traffic specification messages as well as reservations for specific flows. This is a piece of the reservation infrastructure which spans the network from sender to receiver. <ref> [Zha93] </ref> describes RSVP, the reservation setup protocol favored by the IETF. In addition to the basic functions described above the reservation setup protocol needs to accommodate heterogeneous reservations made by the receivers of multicasts. It must also be able to receive and record reservations for future flows.
