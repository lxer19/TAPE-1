Reference-contexts: A well known result presented in [24] proves the impossibility of reaching agreement in an asynchronous system. However, many distributed applications require agreement on group membership among group members in order to operate correctly. Practical systems circumvent this problem by taking a presumably faulty entity out of a view <ref> [1, 23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The sensitivity of congress to host failures and network partitions might prove as a handy tool for a class of fault-tolerant reliable multicast packages such as Transis <ref> [2] </ref>, Isis [13, 14] and Horus [30] when operating in an ATM environment. These packages make use of failure detectors in order to provide strong group semantics to applications using them. Members in a group need to reach agreement on membership in order to make conclusions about common knowledge.

Reference-contexts: order to reach all the group members in the WAN, and does not utilize the native ATM point-to-multipoint multicast mechanism, or any other native ATM mechanism that is obviously more optimal for this type of network technology. 1.1.3 Reliable Multicast over High Speed Networks Markus Hofmann et al. introduced in <ref> [3, 26] </ref> the notion of Local Group concept, which supports reliable multicast communication in large scale heterogeneous networks. The mechanism suggested in this work is aimed to reduce transfer delay, network load and the acknowledgement processing overhead at the sending side.

Reference-contexts: we present a mechanism for implementing IP-over-ATM mul-ticast that make use of either of the above mechanisms, and few protocols for reliable multicast. 1.1.2 MARS and IP Multicast Over ATM Perhaps the most related work relevant for this thesis is the RFC 2022 known as "Multicast Address Resolution Server" (mars) <ref> [4] </ref>. This work describes a mechanism to support the multicast needs of Layer 3 protocols in general, and describes its application to IP multi-casting in particular.

Reference-contexts: Many of these applications make use of highly dynamic multicast groups. One example is a TV broadcasting service that serves groups of clients that may join or leave constantly. Although ATM network protocols ( <ref> [6, 7] </ref>) enable the formation of multicast connections that may be used by such applications, there is no mechanism for managing membership information of multicast groups. This thesis presents for the first time a CONnection-oriented Group-address RESolution Service (congress) for efficient maintenance and propagation of group membership information. <p> One of the fundamental types of ATM connections is the point-to-multipoint connection, which connects a single source end-system (known as the root node) to multiple destination end-systems (known as leaves). This type of connection is unidirectional. In version 3.1 of the ATM UNI <ref> [6] </ref>, only the root node in a point-to-multipoint connection could add (remove) leaves to (from) it. Thus, in order to multicast to a group of end-points (end-systems), a root node needed to have the explicit list of the end-points prior to connection setup. <p> Updates on membership are necessary especially when only root-initiated join is possible, as in the UNI 3.1 <ref> [6] </ref> signaling protocol. However, even when leaf-initiated join is possible, as is in the UNI 4.0 [7] standard, the joining party must know the VC assigned to that specific connection, which is less abstract then a logical group name.

Although ATM network protocols ( <ref> [6, 7] </ref>) enable the formation of multicast connections that may be used by such applications, there is no mechanism for managing membership information of multicast groups. This thesis presents for the first time a CONnection-oriented Group-address RESolution Service (congress) for efficient maintenance and propagation of group membership information. <p> Thus the receivers group of end-points could be changed dynamically by the root node. At the time of the writing of this thesis, the ATM forum has already finished the standardization of UNI 4.0 <ref> [7] </ref>. This version of UNI, includes a new end-point capability regarding the point-to-multipoint connection type. This new capability is known as the Leaf Initiated Join - LIJ capability. It allows one or more leaves (end-points) to join the connection without intervention from the root of the connection. <p> Updates on membership are necessary especially when only root-initiated join is possible, as in the UNI 3.1 [6] signaling protocol. However, even when leaf-initiated join is possible, as is in the UNI 4.0 <ref> [7] </ref> standard, the joining party must know the VC assigned to that specific connection, which is less abstract then a logical group name. Moreover, in order to become connected to all members of the group, the new joiner must know the VCs of the multicast trees of all group members.

Reference-contexts: The UNI specification does not address this problem, but only says that the LIJ identifier "could be obtained through yellow pages, or as a well known id or found through some directory service" <ref> [8] </ref>. What is currently missing from the types of connections in ATM, is the analog for multicasting or broadcasting capability that are present in many shared medium LAN technologies (such as Ethernet for an example).

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that some sort of registration mechanism is needed. It should be noted that UNI 4.0 does provide group addresses, which are used to support the ATM anycast service <ref> [9] </ref>. However, this service allows a user to request a point-to-point connection only to a single ATM end-point that is a member of the group. The user is not provided with a mechanism to resolve the ATM group address into a list of end-point members. <p> The first two problems may be resolved in framework of an ATM anycast service provided by UNI 4.0 <ref> [9] </ref>. However, ATM anycast service provides its user with point-to-point 10 CONTENTS connections only. In order to achieve efficiency, native ATM multicast connections should be used.

Reference-contexts: The use of a group for more than one service can harm application protocols that assume that only relevant messages flow in the group. Malicious end-points could still join 1 The full reference model for native ATM services (Native ATM SAP) is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. 18 CONTENTS permanent groups and attack the protocol executed in them through redundant messages.

Reference-contexts: The addressing scheme proposed by the PNNI signaling protocol <ref> [11] </ref> that divides the hosts and switches in the network into peer groups based on ATM address prefixes is an example of such a scheme.

Reference-contexts: The probability that such scenarios will occur grows as the network becomes larger and more end-points participate in the protocol. Although a name-locking mechanism could be implemented (e.g., using a two-phase commit protocol <ref> [12] </ref>), this mechanism incurs a high overhead at connection set-up time and definitely should not be forced on all end-points that use congress.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this type of connection is not implemented by the ATM signalling, due to problems that are out of the scope of this work. A tool for multicast, a multipoint-to-multipoint distribution tree, is presented in <ref> [18] </ref>. This tool is designed for propagating signalling information and not application data. It also needs to know the group of leaves of the distribution tree in advance.

Reference-contexts: An active server would resolve the clients' addresses through the group name "PayTV" in order to establish a point-to-multipoint connection to the clients. 1.3.2 Video Chat Application As a second example, consider a video chat application, like CU-SeeMe <ref> [19] </ref>, implemented over native ATM. The most natural mechanism for the data transfer in such application would be multicast. The problem, however, is that the membership of a group of participants is not known in advance.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the solution for IP multicast over ATM that is given in this work, and that relies on mars, is far from being optimal for ATM, since it relies on traditional connectionless IP mechanisms such as Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [20] </ref>, for disseminating multicast packets. <p> This protocol will continue to play an extremely important role in the future due to an immense amount of applications that were designed to use it. An efficient implementation of IP over ATM is considered crucial for final success of ATM as a universal communication infrastructure.

The implementation of this solution for IP multicast in an ATM WAN, emulates the connectionless IP routing protocol over connection-oriented ATM network.

Practical systems circumvent this problem by taking a presumably faulty entity out of a view [1, 23]. <p> Some membership information may be delayed in the network and by the time an end-point receives a resolution reply for a group membership, the real membership of the group may have already changed. This is true for any protocol working in an asynchronous environment <ref> [24] </ref>. congress guarantees that if the group membership stops changing at some point, then eventually any resolution request for the group name will result in the correct list of addresses for the members of this group.
