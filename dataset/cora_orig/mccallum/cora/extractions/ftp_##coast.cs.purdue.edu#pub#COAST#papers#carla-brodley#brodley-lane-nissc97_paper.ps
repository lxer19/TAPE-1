Abstract: The anomaly detection problem has been widely studied in the computer security literature. In this paper we present a machine learning approach to anomaly detection. Our system builds user profiles based on command sequences and compares current input sequences to the profile using a similarity measure. The system must learn to classify current behavior as consistent or anomalous with past behavior using only positive examples of the account's valid user. Our empirical results demonstrate that this is a promising approach to distinguishing the legitamate user from an intruder.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present a machine learning approach to anomaly detection designed to handle these two problems. Following <ref> [Denning, 1987] </ref>, our system learns a user profile and subsequently employs it to detect anomalous behavior. Based on sequences of actions (UNIX commands) of the current user's input stream, the system classifies current behavior as consistent or anomalous with past behavior. <p> Traditionally, in computer security, user profiles have been built based on characteristics such as resources consumed, typing rate, login location, and counts of particular commands employed <ref> [Denning, 1987, Smaha, 1988, Lunt, 1990, Frank, 1994] </ref>. These approaches do not use the observation that human/computer interaction is essentially a causal process.

Reference-contexts: For added protection, the adaptive anomaly detection system could also be augmented with a rule-base of known attacks as in <ref> [Lunt, 1990, Heberlein, Dias, Levitt, Mukherjee, Wood & Wolber, 1990] </ref>. A major goal of an adaptive anomaly detection system is to deal with concept drift the behavioral changes undergone by valid users in the normal course of events. Such adaptability, however, leaves a window of opportunity for a malicious attacker.

Reference-contexts: The experiments reported in this paper provided evidence that optimal dictionary size is user dependent. This suggests that a gain in resource efficiency can be made by discarding some historical command data. In other work <ref> [Lane & Brodley, 1997] </ref>, we have investigated sequence selection for this domain. We found an analogy to the operating-systems problem of page replacement selection to be useful, and developed an instance selection algorithm based on the least-recently-used (LRU) page replacement policy.

Reference-contexts: This means that 11 some of the old sequence data will no longer accurately reflect the user's behavior. To handle this concept drift <ref> [Schlimmer, 1987] </ref> a method is needed to remove out-of-date data sequences from the dictionary. At the same time, allowance must be made for the the threat of hostile training of the system.
