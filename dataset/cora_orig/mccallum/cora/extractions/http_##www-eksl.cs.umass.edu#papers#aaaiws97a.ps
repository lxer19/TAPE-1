Reference-contexts: Nearly the only commonality among the Federal and state law enforcement agencies investigating financial crimes was the use of a single analytical technique: link analysis. Link analysis examines a large number of potentially dissimilar database records and establishes links among those records based on data fields with identical values <ref> (Sparrow 1991) </ref>. For example, a record of a person might be linked to a record of a business based on a match between the person's work address and the address of the business.
