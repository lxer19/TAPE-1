Reference-contexts: as legal reasoning, input cases are routinely described in legal briefs that include all relevant features of the situation under consideration; those input cases provide all the features that need to be considered during similarity assessment by CBR systems such as HYPO (Ashley, 1990; Ashley & Rissland, 1987) and GREBE <ref> (Branting & Porter, 1991) </ref>. In contexts such as these, for which input cases are guaranteed to include all relevant features, traditional similarity assessment (which simply compares the new case's features with features of a stored case) is appropriate. <p> The case-based reasoning systems GREBE <ref> (Branting & Porter, 1991) </ref> and PROTOS (Bareiss, 1989), also go beyond requiring literal feature matches.

Reference-contexts: A number of mechanisms have been developed for analogical mapping (Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989; Holyoak & Thagard, 1989; Hofstadter & Mitchell, 1993; Keane, Ledgeway, & Duff, 1994; Mitchell, 1993); one has even been applied to the task of generating explanations by analogy <ref> (Falkenhainer, 1990) </ref>. In general, determining the appropriate mapping is a difficult problem, given the many correspondances that might apply. Our case-based explanation method obviates the problem by not doing complicated reasoning to determine mappings. Instead, it uses the anomaly characterization structures to make a simple mapping process practical.

Reference-contexts: Constructivist perspectives on expert system explanation, for example, stress the need for explanation to support the user's attempt to build up a predictive model <ref> (Ford, Canas, & Adams-Webber, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, the standard input to a planner or problem-solver is a set of goals and constraints; descriptions of those goals and constraints provide the essential information that case-based reasoning systems such as CHEF <ref> (Hammond, 1989) </ref> and JULIA (Kolodner, 1987; Hinrichs, 1992) need in order to judge the similarity of new problems to prior cases stored in their memories.

Reference-contexts: Because many competing alternatives may be generated, choosing between possible candidates is a central issue. As a result, the abductive explanation process is often characterized as "inference to the best explanation" <ref> (Harman, 1965) </ref>. In explanation systems, abductive explanations are generally modeled as deductive proofs whose premises include "abductive assumptions." For example, an explanation of a device malfunction would be a proof showing that a set of assumptions about particular malfunctioning components entailed the observed device behavior.

Reference-contexts: This case-based approach to explanation was originally developed in the SWALE system (Kass, 1986; Leake & Owens, 1986; Schank, 1986; Schank & Leake, 1989). The methods developed in that work were further refined in the system's descendents ABE <ref> (Kass, 1990, 1994) </ref> and ACCEPTER (Leake, 1992b, 1994a). The current version of ACCEPTER is a story understanding program explaining anomalies in the domain of deaths, defects, and destruction.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, CBR systems for other tasks have used a two-step retrieval/evaluation process that selects a set of candidate cases and filters the results, as in PARADYME <ref> (Kolodner, 1989) </ref> and STAIN (Simoudis & Miller, 1991). 27 However, the constructive similarity assessment process used for ACCEPTER's second phase of similarity assessment differs markedly from most similarity assessment methods.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of the features that are likely to be relevant can also be used prior to retrieval to guide collection of important features to represent in a case description; this process is called situation assessment <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In general, that library could be provided by external sources (e.g., by being told explanations or reading about explained episodes) or initially built up by backwards chaining methods that generate explanations starting from scratch <ref> (Koton, 1988) </ref>. After that initial information is provided, the library is built up by storing the new explanations that the case-based explanation process generates. 5 it also involved a famous female athlete as its victim. 3. <p> Likewise, CASEY <ref> (Koton, 1988) </ref> accepts new features in an input situation if they support the existence of states mentioned in the old case, and accepts the absence of features that were not used in the previous explanation.

Reference-contexts: The difficulty of determining relevant features in advance seriously complicates the problem of deciding the similarity of an input case and a previously-explained situation. We address this problem with a novel similarity assessment method that we call constructive similarity assessment <ref> (Leake, 1992a) </ref>. Rather than simply matching known features of old and new cases, constructive similarity assessment uses prior cases to determine which features of an input situation to examine. Using prior cases to provide guidance, it hypothesizes possible features of incomplete case descriptions, filling in missing details.

The methods developed in that work were further refined in the system's descendents ABE (Kass, 1990, 1994) and ACCEPTER <ref> (Leake, 1992b, 1994a) </ref>. The current version of ACCEPTER is a story understanding program explaining anomalies in the domain of deaths, defects, and destruction. <p> In light of this example we can identify two questions that an explanation of an anomaly must answer <ref> (Leake, 1992b, 1994a) </ref>. The first is why the surprising event (or surprising features of the event) occurred.

Reference-contexts: This gives more flexibility and a more perspicacious judgement. This flexibility will become especially important in systems that can improve their adaptation capabilities by learning new adaptation rules <ref> (Leake, 1993, 1994c) </ref>: As the ability of these systems to adapt cases improves, constructive similarity assessment will automatically reflect that improvement by treating a wider class of cases as usefully similar.

Reference-contexts: This reminding focused attention on a small subset of the many possible explanations: at 4 tacks aimed at aiding one of the victim's rivals. Psychological studies support that human explainers tend to favor explanations based on remindings <ref> (Read & Cesa, 1991) </ref>. The case-based approach to explanation is inspired by this human use of specific prior episodes to guide the explanation process. 2.1 Steps of the case-based explanation process Starting from an input anomaly, 1 the case-based reasoning process for generating explanations involves the following steps: 1.

Reference-contexts: The case-based approach also learns and re-uses information from explanation episodes. However, rather than re-using generalizations it re-uses specific prior explanations: It uses remindings of prior episodes as the starting point for new explanations <ref> (Schank, 1982, 1986) </ref>. Remindings give very specific guidance towards candidate explanations, as illustrated by the following episode, which will be used as a running example throughout this article. In early 1994, figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was attacked after completing a figure skating practice session. <p> In the case-based explanation systems we describe, belief revision is triggered by detection of anomalies|conflicts between 8 new information and prior beliefs or expectations. This approach is consistent with a large body of AI research that uses expectation failures <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref> as a trigger for learning (Collins & Birnbaum, 1988; Collins, Birnbaum, Krulwich, & Freed, 1993; Hammond, 1989; Redmond, 1992; Ram, 1993; Ram & Cox, 1994; Riesbeck, 1981; Schank, 1982, 1986).

Reference-contexts: Explanation retrieval: Retrieve the stored explanation whose anomaly characterization is most similar to the characterization for the current anomaly, from a library of prior explanations stored in memory represented as explanation patterns (XPs) <ref> (Schank, 1986) </ref>. 2 For example, in the Kerrigan episode, the attack on Monica Seles is a retrieval candidate because it shares the anomaly of being an apparently unmotivated attack, and because 1 Existing case-based explanation systems attempt to explain each anomaly as soon as it is detected, so that only one

Reference-contexts: However, the computational cost entailed by these methods is a significant concern, as has been established both by theoretical analysis (Bylander, Allemang, Tanner, & Josephson, 1991; Selman & Levesque, 1990) and experiments applying diagnosis systems to real-world abductive tasks <ref> (Tuhrim, Reggia, & Goodall, 1991) </ref>. One approach to controling the cost of explanation generation is to use prior knowledge to guide the explanation process.
