Abstract: We introduce a theory of rectangular scaling of integer lattices. This may be used to construct families of lattices. We determine the relation between the Zaremba index ae(fl) of various members of the same family. It appears that if one member of a family has a high index, some of the other family members of higher order may have extraordinarily high indices. We have applied a technique based on this theory to lists of good lattices available to us. This has enabled us to construct lists of excellent previously-unknown lattices of high order in three and four dimensions and of moderate order in five dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Undoubtedly, the most outstanding lattices on these lists are (i) a three-dimensional lattice having N = 9760, ae = 864, and z = 0:81319, and (ii) a four-dimensional lattice having N = 8992, ae = 212, and z = 1:95413. The results of scaling the short list <ref> [BP85] </ref> of five-dimensional rank 1 simple lattices were relatively unexciting. Possible reasons for this are mentioned in Section 5. We found no lattices whose z-values exceeded z 5 , and only 25 whose z-values exceeded 2/3 z 5 . <p> This list is unpublished. * Red list As above; N 2 [32; 562]; contains 23 entries. this list is published in [LS92]. * Blue list As above; N 2 [52; 3298]; contains 47 entries.

Each of these seven lists were processed in the same way. This process produced from the input list, three more lists. <p> Five-dimensional Lattices having z (fl) &gt; 3:0 Rank 1 simple lattices in this list having N 2 [112; 772] have been taken from <ref> [BP85] </ref>. The others are scaled versions of these or of the benchmark lattice.

Reference-contexts: Our measure is based on the Zaremba conjecture that suggests that there exists a constant z s such that ae s (N ) z s (log N ) s2 ; s 2: (1:5) For s = 2 the conjecture has been proved by Zaremba [Zar66]. Following Kedem and Zaremba <ref> [KZ74] </ref>, we assign to every lattice a value defined by z (fl) = N This is of course nothing more than a scaled version of ae (fl). <p> This list is published in [LS91] * Blue list N 2 [21; 6066]; contains 101 entries.

It contains only rank-1 simple lattices, assembled from this subclass, using the standard red list convention described above. 12 2. Four Dimensions * Green list As above; N 2 [20; 600]; contains 16127 entries, but is not complete.

Reference-contexts: The present paper, on the other hand, is devoted to providing concrete examples of lattices whose reciprocal may be used to construct cost-effective lattice rules. These examples seem to confirm the theory and are in compliance with the truth of the conjecture.

Reference-contexts: We have uncovered many high-order lattice rules in dimensions 3, 4, and to some extent 5. The best are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 8, respectively. These turn out as might be expected in view of the current advanced theory (see, for example, Niederreiter <ref> [Nie92] </ref>). It is our hope that these concrete examples will provide a spur to the recognition and practical application of lattice rules in actual scientific projects involving multidimensional quadrature. 23 Appendix: Red Scaled Red Lists The two lists in this appendix are included to illustrate the discussion in Section 6.2.

Reference-contexts: This is the upper triangular lattice form or Hermite Normal form of any generator matrix of fl (see the remarks at the end of Section 1). Then comes the rank of the corresponding lattice rule. (See <ref> [SL89] </ref> for a full discussion of rank.) In this column an entry 0 indicates rank 1 simple (see [LS92]), and an entry 1 indicates rank 1 not simple. In Tables 1 and 2, we identify the list from which this lattice was taken.

Reference-contexts: Our measure is based on the Zaremba conjecture that suggests that there exists a constant z s such that ae s (N ) z s (log N ) s2 ; s 2: (1:5) For s = 2 the conjecture has been proved by Zaremba <ref> [Zar66] </ref>. Following Kedem and Zaremba [KZ74], we assign to every lattice a value defined by z (fl) = N This is of course nothing more than a scaled version of ae (fl).

Reference-contexts: This paper is not directly concerned with the conjectures on which such estimates are based. We note, however, that there exists a bound on ae s (N ) of order O (N=(log N ) s1 ) <ref> [Zar74] </ref> and that both the conjecture and bound are in the context of number theoretic rules; that is they are restricted to lattice rules of rank 1.
