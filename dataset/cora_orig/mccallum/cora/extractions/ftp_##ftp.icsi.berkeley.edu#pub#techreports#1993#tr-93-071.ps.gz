Title: Lower Bounds on Testing Membership to a Polyhedron by Algebraic Decision Trees  
Author: Dima Grigoriev Marek Karpinski Nicolai Vorobjov 
Date: November, 1993  
Pubnum: TR-93-071  
Abstract: We describe a new method of proving lower bounds on the depth of algebraic decision trees and apply it to prove a lower bound (log N) for testing membership to a convex polyhedron having N facets of all dimensions. This bound apparently does not follow from the methods developed by M. Ben-Or, A. Bjorner, L. Lovasz, A. Yao ([B 83], [BLY 92]) because the topological invariants used in these methods become trivial for the convex polyhedra.

Let an algebraic computation tree T 0 of the depth k 0 test a membership to an n-dimensional polyhedron P R n . Denote by N 0 the number of all (n 1)-facets of P .
