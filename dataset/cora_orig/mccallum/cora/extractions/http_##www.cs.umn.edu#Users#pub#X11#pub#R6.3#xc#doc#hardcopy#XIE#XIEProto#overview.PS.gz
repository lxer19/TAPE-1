Title: X Image Extension Overview  
Author: J. Ben Fahy, Ph.D. Robert N.C. Shelley 
Keyword: XIE Design Goals  
Abstract: The X Image Extension provides a powerful mechanism for the transfer and display of virtually any image on any X-capable hardware. While not intended for use as a general purpose image-processing engine, XIE does provide a robust set of image rendition and enhancement primitives that can be combined into arbitrarily complex expressions. XIE also provides import and export facilities for moving images between client and server The X Image Extension (XIE) was designed to facilitate efficient and robust image display on X Window System servers. XIE provides tools for rapidly transferring an image from client to server and for converting the image format to match the server's hardware characteristics. XIE does not attempt to provide tools for general-purpose image processing. However, simple image enhancement and filtering operations such as contrast enhancement and convolution are available, as well as dithering, geometric transformations, histogram generation, and so on. The X Window clientserver architecture was based on the assumption that data on the wire would be of a relatively high level. Therefore, a high-bandwidth connection is not an absolute requirement for X. However, image transfer requires sending large amounts of low-level data, which may take an unacceptable amount of time on slow or heavily loaded networks. This image transport bottleneck makes the X Window System less than optimal for supporting image-intensive applications. XIE solves the image transport problem by supporting the transmission of compressed images across the wire and providing image decompression facilities in the server. Compression ratios on the order of 20:1 or more are common for bitonal images. The client can send a relatively modest amount of data to the server where it is decompressed into a much larger data structure. Since the image may not fit completely on the server's display monitor at full resolution, XIE supports geometric operations, such as scale and rotation, to allow an image to be transformed to fit in a reasonable window size as is depicted in Figure 1. Rendition in XIE is defined as the process of changing the format of an image in order to make it compatible with the server's frame buffer, its associated lookup table(s), and other limitations. Once an image has been rendered, it may be transferred directly to the hardware and viewed on the screen. Rendering a complicated image to be compatible with highly limited hardware can be quite challenging and may require a series of manipulations to be performed on the image. It may be necessary to convert the image from trichromatic to monochromatic (gray scale or bitonal). A scaling operation can be used to reduce the image's size to fit the screen dimensions. Convolution provides a means for sharpening the image or performing other general filtering operations. Dithering may be used to reduce the number of quantization levels to comply with the number of colormap entries available, and so on. Copyright 1994 AGE Logic, Inc.
