Abstract: In this paper we analyse a multi-server queueing model with locking. The model is motivated by a situation we encountered at a maintenance facility for trains. Maintenance is done at parallel tracks, where each track offers space to two trains. Trains can enter and leave the tracks from one and the same side only. This gives rise to locking of the front train: in order to leave the maintenance track the front train has to wait till maintenance of the back train (if there is one) has also been completed. Hence, part of the maintenance (or track) capacity is lost. The queueing model is used to investigate the loss of capacity and its effect on sojourn times. The performance of this system is also compared with other designs. A surprising result is that in light traffic it is better to use only half of the track capacity by allowing no more than one train at a maintenance track.

Reference-contexts: We will refer to these equations as the boundary equations. The precise form of the boundary equations is not relevant to the analysis, and therefore, they are omitted. The approach to solve the balance equations is inspired on earlier work <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 8] </ref> and proceeds as follows.

Reference-contexts: It will be difficult to prove directly that there are sufficiently many zeros inside the unit circle and to numerically determine these zeros. Therefore we employ an idea of <ref> [8, 6, 3] </ref> to transform the difference equations (4) into a single differential equation for the generating function of the sequence y (m). This approach, in fact, leads to a nice factorization of the determinantal equation.

Reference-contexts: The geometric factors are the roots (inside the unit circle) of a determinantal equation. This approach is closely related to the one in <ref> [7] </ref>. By using a generating-function technique we have shown that the determinant can be factorized (see remark 3.2), which considerably simplifies the determination of the roots.
