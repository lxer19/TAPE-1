Abstract: A visual cryptography scheme is a method to encode a secret image SI into shadow images called shares such that certain qualified subsets of shares enable the "visual" recovery of the secret image. The "visual" recovery consists of xeroxing the shares onto transparencies, and then stacking them. The shares of a qualified set will reveal the secret image without any cryptographic computation. In this paper we analyze the contrast of the reconstructed image in k out of n visual cryptography schemes. (In such a scheme any k shares will reveal the image, but no set of k 1 shares gives any information about the image.) In the case of 2 out of n threshold schemes we give a complete characterization of schemes having optimal contrast and minimum pixel expansion in terms of certain balanced incomplete block designs. In the case of k out of n threshold schemes with k 3 we obtain upper and lower bounds on the optimal contrast.

Reference-contexts: They analyzed the case of a k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes, in which the secret image is visible if and only if any k transparencies are stacked together. Further results on k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in <ref> [1, 2, 9, 10] </ref>. The model by Naor and Shamir has been extended in [1, 2] to general access structures (an access structure is a specification of all qualified and forbidden subsets of participants), where general techniques to construct visual cryptography schemes for any access structure have been proposed. <p> Further results on k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in [1, 2, 9, 10]. The model by Naor and Shamir has been extended in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> to general access structures (an access structure is a specification of all qualified and forbidden subsets of participants), where general techniques to construct visual cryptography schemes for any access structure have been proposed. <p> Naor and Shamir showed (see Theorem 5.3 in [15]) that there exist (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes with m = 2 O (k log k) log n and ff (m) = 2 (k) . The construction presented in <ref> [1] </ref> (see Theorem 6.2) yields schemes with m = O (k (2e) k log n). The value of m is less than the one in the Naor and Shamir construction, but this was achieved by relaxing the condition that all values t X are equal. <p> For small values of k and n, the schemes obtained are quite efficient. However, for n large with respect to k, the value of m is much larger than in the schemes obtained in <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. In this paper we will present new techniques to realize (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes achieving a bigger value of the relative difference when k &lt; n. <p> The next lemma was proved in <ref> [1] </ref>; we repeat its proof here for the reader's convenience. Lemma 3.1 Let ( Qual ; Forb ) be an access structure on a set of participants P. <p> exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; m)-VCS, then there exists a ([P 0 ] Qual ; [P 0 ] Forb ; m)-VCS. 4 (2; n)-threshold VCSs with Optimal Contrast In this section we describe (2; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes achieving a greater relative difference than the ones presented in <ref> [1, 2, 9, 15] </ref>. (This construction was first mentioned in [2] and a similar construction in the case where n is even was given in [10, Section 5.2].) The n fi m basis matrix S 1 is realized by considering all the binary n-vectors of weight bn=2c. <p> The weight of any column of M is either bn=2c or dn=2e. 2. For any pair of distinct rows of M any unavoidable pattern appears exactly ff (m) m times. 3. For any M 2 C 0 [ C 1 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = w (M [2]) = = w (M [n]), that is, all the rows have the same weight w. Moreover, if n is even, then w = m=2; otherwise bn=2c (m=n) w dn=2e (m=n). 9 5. For any M 2 C 1 the set fM [1]; M [2]; : : <p> w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = w (M [2]) = = w (M [n]), that is, all the rows have the same weight w. Moreover, if n is even, then w = m=2; otherwise bn=2c (m=n) w dn=2e (m=n). 9 5. For any M 2 C 1 the set fM [1]; M [2]; : : : ; M [n]g is a (m; n; 2 ff fl (n) m) equidistant code with constant weight w. Proof. <p> From Property 2: of Definition 2.1 for any M 2 C 0 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = = w (M [n]), hence we get that M [1] = M [2] = = M [n]. For any M 2 C 1 the rows of M have the same weight w and any two rows of M differ in exactly 2 ff fl (n) m positions. <p> From Property 2: of Definition 2.1 for any M 2 C 0 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = = w (M [n]), hence we get that M [1] = M [2] = = M [n]. For any M 2 C 1 the rows of M have the same weight w and any two rows of M differ in exactly 2 ff fl (n) m positions. <p> Therefore, we get that, up to a column permutation, S 0 [Y ] = S 1 [Y ] and Property 2 of Definition 2.2 is satisfied. Thus, the theorem holds. Example 6.1 We give basis matrices for a (3; 4)-threshold VCS presented in <ref> [1] </ref>: S 0 = 6 6 000111 001101 3 7 5 2 6 4 100110 001110 7 7 : This VCS has m = 6 and ff (m) = 1=6. From this scheme we obtain two (2; 3)-threshold VCS. <p> Indeed, let C 0 and C 1 be the collections of n fi m boolean matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS . Without loss of generality we can assume that r = jC 0 j = jC 1 j (see Section 2.1 of <ref> [1] </ref>). We can easily realize from C 0 and C 1 a scheme having the same relative difference as . Suppose that C 0 = fM 0;1 ; : : : ; M 0;r g and C 1 = fM 1;1 ; : : : ; M 1;r g. <p> Hence, it follows that ff (k; n) 2 k2 : As a consequence of the previous theorem we have the following results which solve an open problem in <ref> [1] </ref>. The next result closes the gap on the pixel expansion for the access structures #16 and #17 analyzed in Section 9 of [1]. Theorem 6.4 Let 1 and 2 be the access structures having basis f123; 124; 134; 234g and f123; 124; 134g, respectively. <p> it follows that ff (k; n) 2 k2 : As a consequence of the previous theorem we have the following results which solve an open problem in <ref> [1] </ref>. The next result closes the gap on the pixel expansion for the access structures #16 and #17 analyzed in Section 9 of [1]. Theorem 6.4 Let 1 and 2 be the access structures having basis f123; 124; 134; 234g and f123; 124; 134g, respectively. In any visual cryptography scheme for 1 or 2 , the relative difference satisfies ff (m) 1=6 which implies that the pixel expansion m satisfies m 6. Proof. <p> Proof. From Corollary 6.2 we get that m (k; n) 2 m (k 1; n 1) from which we obtain that m (k; n) 2 k2 m (2; n k + 2). Applying Theorem 7.3 of <ref> [1] </ref>, which states that in any (2; n)-threshold VCS, the pixel expansion m satisfies n m 2 c , the theorem holds. The next corollary is an immediate consequence of previous theorem. <p> Consequently, h ff (m) m, ff (m) 1=2 k1 , and m 2 k1 . Proof. We start by noticing that by Property 1 of Definition 2.2, the column with all zeroes has to belong to S 0 (e.g., see Lemma 5.11 of <ref> [1] </ref>). Assume that this all zeroes column appears with multiplicity h (by Lemma 5.11 of [1] it holds that h ff (m) m). Suppose that c and d are boolean columns of length k that differ only in one entry, say the i-th entry. <p> Proof. We start by noticing that by Property 1 of Definition 2.2, the column with all zeroes has to belong to S 0 (e.g., see Lemma 5.11 of <ref> [1] </ref>). Assume that this all zeroes column appears with multiplicity h (by Lemma 5.11 of [1] it holds that h ff (m) m). Suppose that c and d are boolean columns of length k that differ only in one entry, say the i-th entry. Suppose that c appears with multiplicity h in S j (j = 0 or 1). <p> Lemma 5.3 of <ref> [1] </ref> states that if S 0 and S 1 are the two basis matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS and D is any n fi p boolean matrix, then S 0 ffi D and S 1 ffi D are basis matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS.

So we again have m n. Let's assume that m = n. Then it follows from (3) that w = (n 1)=2 or w = (n + 1)=2, so we have two cases to consider. In the first case, Equation (4) says that s = 0.

Reference-contexts: Using a linear programming technique, they give constructions in [10] for (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes having large relative difference, for k 2 f3; 4; ng. Also, for k = 2, they have independently derived some results similar to ours for certain values of n. In <ref> [5] </ref> a canonical form for (k; n)-threshold VCS was presented and a complete characterization of contrast optimal (n 1; n)-threshold VCS in canonical form was given.

The n fi m basis matrix S 1 is realized by considering all the binary n-vectors of weight bn=2c. Hence, m = n and any row in S 1 has weight equal to n1 . <p> Note that the bound holds for weak or strong threshold VCS. The proof is essentially the same as the proof of the Plotkin bound from coding theory (see, for example, van Lint [11]). This result was first mentioned in [2] and a similar result was also proved in <ref> [10, Theorem 3.5] </ref> for n even; our bound is slightly stronger for n odd. Theorem 4.2 Let n 2. In any (2; n)-threshold visual cryptography scheme with pixel expansion m, it holds that ff (m) ff fl (n). Proof. Let M 2 C 1 . <p> Then m &gt; &lt; 2n 2 if n is even n if n 3 mod 4. 15 Note that all the inequalities in Theorem 4.9 are in fact equalities if the Hadamard Matrix Conjecture is true. We note that in <ref> [10, Lemma 3.6] </ref>, for the particular case of n = 2 k , it was shown using a Hadamard matrix of order 2 k that there exists a (2; n)-threshold VCS with pixel expansion m = 2n 2 and (optimal) relative difference ff (m) = ff fl (n). <p> From Equation (2) in the proof of Theorem 4.2, we have the following: m bn=2cdn=2e 4 (n 1) ff (m) m 4n (n 1)(m + 1) : From this it follows that m n 1. We note that it was shown in <ref> [10, Theorem 3.8] </ref> that m d n 2 e whenever ff (m) 1=4. If we hope to construct a threshold VCS with m &lt; n 1, we must have ff 1=4. <p> In this construction, we have m = O ( p n), which is a significant improvement over m = (n), which is the best possible when ff (m) &gt; 1=4. In <ref> [10] </ref>, a stronger result is obtained using a non-constructive proof: Hofmeister, Krause and Simon use the Gilbert-Varshamov bound to show that there exist (2; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes in which m is O (14ff) 2 , for any ff &lt; 1=4. 5 Some Constructions for (k; n)-threshold VCS In this section <p> Finally, we note that it was shown in [5] that, for any n 4, there exists a contrast optimal (3; n)-threshold scheme ff (m) = ((n 2b (n + 1)=4c)b (n + 1)=4c)=(2 (n 1)(n 2)); whereas, in <ref> [10, Section 5.3] </ref> it was shown that there exist a contrast optimal (3; n)-threshold schemes with ff (m) = n 2 =(16 (n 1)(n 2)) &gt; 1=16, for all n 0 mod 4. <p> The "if" part of Theorem 7.1 was first shown by Naor and Shamir [15]. Hofmeister, Krause and Simon proved, using a linear programming approach, that contrast optimal (k; k)-threshold VCS have the same structure than the one described in Theorem 7.1. (see <ref> [10, Section 5.1] </ref>) Also, Theorem 7.1 gives a more precise characterization of (k; k)-threshold VCS than the one provided by Theorem 10 and Corollary 11 of [9] which can be easily derived from our last result.

Reference-contexts: Note that the bound holds for weak or strong threshold VCS. The proof is essentially the same as the proof of the Plotkin bound from coding theory (see, for example, van Lint <ref> [11] </ref>). This result was first mentioned in [2] and a similar result was also proved in [10, Theorem 3.5] for n even; our bound is slightly stronger for n odd. Theorem 4.2 Let n 2. <p> The following is standard theory of BCH codes; see <ref> [11] </ref> for more details. Suppose n = q t 1, where q is a prime power and t is an integer.

Thus, we have the following corollary.

Reference-contexts: The participants in a qualified set X will be able to see the secret image without any knowledge of cryptography and without performing any cryptographic computation. 1 This cryptographic paradigm was introduced by Naor and Shamir <ref> [15] </ref>. They analyzed the case of a k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes, in which the secret image is visible if and only if any k transparencies are stacked together. <p> This can be thought of as a form of information hiding or steganography and it is referred to as an extended visual cryptography scheme. Naor and Shamir <ref> [15] </ref> first considered this method of concealing the existence of the secret message for the case of 2 out of 2 threshold VCS. <p> More precisely, C 0 and C 1 comprise a ( 0 ; Forb ; m)-VCS with relative difference at least ff (m). There are few differences between the model of visual cryptography we propose and the one presented by Naor and Shamir <ref> [15] </ref>. Our model is a generalization of the one proposed in [15], since with each set X 2 Qual we associate a (possibly) different threshold t X . Further, the access structure is not required to be strong in our model. <p> There are few differences between the model of visual cryptography we propose and the one presented by Naor and Shamir <ref> [15] </ref>. Our model is a generalization of the one proposed in [15], since with each set X 2 Qual we associate a (possibly) different threshold t X . Further, the access structure is not required to be strong in our model. <p> Note that, in this case, the size of the collections C 0 and C 1 is the same and it is denoted by r. This technique was first introduced in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> In a strong (k; n)-threshold VCS the image remains visible if more than k participants stack their transparencies. Naor and Shamir showed (see Theorem 5.3 in <ref> [15] </ref>) that there exist (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes with m = 2 O (k log k) log n and ff (m) = 2 (k) . The construction presented in [1] (see Theorem 6.2) yields schemes with m = O (k (2e) k log n). <p> For small values of k and n, the schemes obtained are quite efficient. However, for n large with respect to k, the value of m is much larger than in the schemes obtained in <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. In this paper we will present new techniques to realize (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes achieving a bigger value of the relative difference when k &lt; n. <p> Moreover, for n 4, a contrast optimal (3; n)-threshold VCS in canonical form has been provided. Finally, for k = 4; 5 two schemes with contrast asymptotically equal to 1=64 and 1=256, respectively, are presented. The construction of a (k; k)-threshold VCS is obtained (see <ref> [15] </ref>) by means of the construction of the basis matrices T 0 k and T 1 k defined as follows: T 0 k is the matrix whose columns are all the boolean k-vectors having an even number of `1's, and T 1 k is the matrix whose columns are all the <p> In such a scheme we have that the pixel expansion m is equal to 2 k1 . In <ref> [15] </ref> it was proved that the (k; k)- threshold VCS obtained from this construction is uniform, that is, for every 1 p k 1 the "or" of any p rows of T 0 k and T 1 k has weight f (p) for some function f . <p> exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; m)-VCS, then there exists a ([P 0 ] Qual ; [P 0 ] Forb ; m)-VCS. 4 (2; n)-threshold VCSs with Optimal Contrast In this section we describe (2; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes achieving a greater relative difference than the ones presented in <ref> [1, 2, 9, 15] </ref>. (This construction was first mentioned in [2] and a similar construction in the case where n is even was given in [10, Section 5.2].) The n fi m basis matrix S 1 is realized by considering all the binary n-vectors of weight bn=2c. <p> Indeed, S 0 and S 1 can be thought of as the concatenation of h copies of the matrices T 0 k and T 1 k , respectively, described at the beginning of Section 3. The "if" part of Theorem 7.1 was first shown by Naor and Shamir <ref> [15] </ref>.
