Abstract: Real-time continuous media traffic, such as digital video and audio, is expected to comprise a large percentage of the network load on future high speed packet switch networks such as ATM. A major feature which distinguishes high speed networks from traditional slower speed networks is the large amount of data the network must manage. For efficient network usage, traffic control mechanisms are essential. Currently, most mechanisms for traffic control (such as flow control) have centered on the support of Available Bit Rate (ABR), i.e., non real-time, traffic. With regard to ATM, for ABR traffic, two major types of schemes which have been proposed are rate-control and credit-control schemes. Neither of these schemes are directly applicable to Real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic such as continuous media traffic. Traffic control for continuous media traffic is an inherently difficult problem due to the time-sensitive nature of the traffic and its unpredictable burstiness. In this study, we present a scheme which controls traffic by dynamically allocating/de-allocating resources among competing VCs based upon their real-time requirements. This scheme incorporates a form of rate-control, real-time burst-level scheduling and link-link flow control. We show analytically potential performance improvements of our rate-control scheme and present a scheme for buffer dimensioning. We also present simulation results of our schemes and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in maintaining high network utilization and statistically guaranteeing many users' Quality of Service.

Reference-contexts: The greater (above 1) the value of Equation 2 (Equation 3), the larger the increase in statistical sharing of link capacity (buffer space). Cell level QoS vs burst level QoS. Several Quality of Service (QoS) parameters which users use to indicate their desired quality of service have been defined <ref> [1] </ref>. They include the following. 1. Cell Loss Ratio. This is the ratio of cells which are initially transmitted by the source but not delivered to the destination. 2. Cell Transfer Delay. This measures the elapsed time for a cell between the network entry point and the network exit point. <p> In our real-time scheduling approach, we incorporate the notion of burst-level scheduling. 2.2 Traffic Control The dual leaky bucket mechanism has been proposed as a means for traffic control (or traffic shaping) [21, 22]. It has been formulated in <ref> [1] </ref> as the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA). The GCRA is an algorithm which defines and maintains the relationship between Peak Cell Rate, Cell Delay Variation, Sustained Cell Rate and Burst Tolerance. Conceptually, the GCRA describes two leaky buckets in tandem, i.e., a dual leaky bucket. <p> That is, if a VC is not using its guaranteed resources, another VC may use them. * Simplicity. The algorithms are computationally simple. The proposed Shared Guaranteed Resource Dual Leaky Bucket mechanism requires little additional hardware functionality than the standard proposed dual leaky bucket described by the GCRA algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Recall that all that is needed to implement a leaky bucket (peak rate controller) is a timer and counter; a token leaky bucket requires an additional counter (in addition to its own timer). As mentioned in Section 1, we will use the notion of the proposed Resource Management cell. <p> As mentioned in Section 1, we will use the notion of the proposed Resource Management cell. An ATM cell will indicate whether it is a RM cell by setting its payload type field to 110 <ref> [1] </ref>. The following three types of RM cells will be used by this study's algorithms. * A burst reservation RM cell. Most RM cells in the network will be of this type. It is assummed that a burst reservation RM cell will immediately precede each burst. <p> In cases where a superscript is not used, the case is applicable to either set. Let (a) sum = i=1 jburst ij (b) q [i] denotes the number of queued cells at the ith output slot. For instance, q B <ref> [1] </ref> = N 1 and q B [sum] = 0. (c) count [i] denotes the summation of the number of times cell i contributed to the queue length during each contention time slot. Note that: P 8x;y count [c xy ] = P sum j=1 q j .

Reference-contexts: There are five defined ATM layer service categories: Constant Bit Rate, Non Real-time Variable Bit Rate, Real-time Variable Bit Rate, Available Bit Rate and Unspecified Bit Rate <ref> [8] </ref>. In our study, we consider Real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. In particular, we consider real-time bursty periodic traffic. Continuous media traffic, the predominant form of multimedia traffic, such as video and audio is a bursty periodic traffic source. <p> For instance, digital coded video consists of a series of burst (frames) where each frame occurs every 30 milliseconds (NTSC digital video standard).

Reference-contexts: Credit type schemes are not suitable for real-time traffic unless some notion of real-time delivery constraints are incorporated. Traffic control for Real-time VBR traffic is considered a difficult area due to the time-sensitive nature of the traffic. So it has been proposed <ref> [12] </ref> in networks with real-time VBR (guaranteed) traffic to allocate peak resources while, for the sake of network utilization, allowing ABR traffic to consume the leftover resources after the guaranteed traffic has been served. The goal is high network utilization (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: This is a straight forward way of maintaining the traffic shape throughout the network. However, the traffic shape of continuous media traffic, particular digital video, is not naturally captured by a set of static paramenters. For instance, MPEG <ref> [16] </ref>, which is considered to be the most likely used digital video compression standard of the future, produces data which is highly bursty. <p> Input traces. The input streams consisted of (simulated) frames from a MPEG codec. The input video stream for the MPEG codec was a 3 minute 40 second sequence from the movie Star Wars <ref> [16] </ref>. The sequence was digitized from laser disc with a frame resolution (similar to NTSC broadcast quality) of 512 fi 480 pixels. This particular Star Wars sequence was chosen because it contained a mix of high and low action scenes. The interframe to intraframe ratio was 16.
