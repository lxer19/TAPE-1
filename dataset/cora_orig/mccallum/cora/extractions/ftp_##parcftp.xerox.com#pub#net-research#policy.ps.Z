Title: Service Models and Pricing Policies for an Integrated Services Internet

Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of services in the Internet and the resulting impact on pricing policies. I first address why an integrated services Internet is desirable, and give an overview of the services it is likely to offer. I then argue that an integrated services Internet, in order to be efficient, must employ per-user, quality-of-service sensitive, and usage-based pricing policies.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of this section describes one such proposed service model 19 (see References <ref> [1, 28] </ref> for a much fuller exposition). The service model is based on the requirements of applications and institutions. Applications can be roughly divided into those that are elastic or scalable, and those that are real-time.

Assuming that the principle of common carriage 27 applies to these networks (there are those that doubt the viability of this principle; see <ref> [20] </ref>), then a firm can purchase network service from one provider and resell it to others. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with reselling; in some sense it is simply the transfer of marketing responsibilities.
