Abstract: In this paper, we show how case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques can be applied to document retrieval. The fundamental idea is to automatically convert textual documents into appropriate case representations and use these to retrieve relevant documents in a problem situation. In contrast to Information Retrieval techniques, we assume that a Textual CBR system focuses on a particular domain and thus can employ knowledge from that domain. We give an overview over our approach to Textual CBR, describe a particular application project, and evaluate the performance of the system.

Reference-contexts: using a more structured representation, such as attribute-value pairs and a specific type of similarity measure can usually be applied to compare different attribute values. 3 Textual CBR As mentioned before, the fundamental idea of CBR is to recall relevant cases from earlier problem solving episodes in a problem context <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Finally, if they answer the request, this is added to the document collection and thus the Automatic Hotline automatically acquires new knowledge and extends its scope of handable requests. Fig. 2. Process model of the Automatic Hotline based on the R 4 model <ref> [1] </ref> The Automatic Hotline directly utilizes a number of document types which are available at Siemens. These include usual FAQs, Informal Notes on recently observed problems as a simple verbal description of these problems and User Information Notes.

Reference-contexts: In the hotline scenario, however, the goal is not to retrieve all relevant items but rather to answer a query successfully. Hence, one relevant document is sufficient (for a similar discussion see <ref> [2] </ref>). Concerning the second problem, we modified the notion of recall such that for a single query recall is 1.0 if a relevant document has been retrieved, and 0 otherwise. The first problem was harder to overcome. <p> The FAQFinder project <ref> [2] </ref> is probably the most similar approach to CBR-Answers. FAQFinder, too, applies CBR in combination with other techniques to document management. In particular, the goal is to answer questions by retrieving relevant FAQs from USENET news groups. It uses WordNet [12] to base its reasoning on a semantic knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: In FAQFinder, on the contrary, the semantic base (i.e. WordNet) is the same for all news group topics and knowledge specific to a single domain can not be incorporated. SPIRE uses a completely different approach for dealing with textual cases <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Based on the observation from the field of IR that people have problems in formulating good queries to IR systems, the idea behind SPIRE is to use a combination of CBR and IR technology: A user's request for some information is analyzed by means of a CBR module.

Reference-contexts: The application scenario here is very close to the general hotline scenario as sketched in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a semantic similarity measure of CBR systems will contain additional knowledge as a supplement to the other knowledge containers. A more detailed comparison of IR models and Textual CBR is given in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.2 The CBR-Answers project Within the CBR-Answers project we addressed the application of CBR techniques in situations like the hotline scenario.

Reference-contexts: Case structure and case representation. In order to access the information contained in the textual documents, each document is converted into a single case. This process is performed automatically, i.e. no manual case authoring has to be performed. For case representation, we used the Case Retrieval Net (CRN) model <ref> [9] </ref> where each case is described by a set of Information Entities (IEs). Each IE captures a specific case feature. <p> The retrieval process directly utlizes the IEs of cases and their similarity relationships as they are encoded by means of a Case Retrieval Net. In particular, efficiency and flexibility are valuable benefits of this model <ref> [9] </ref>. General system architecture. Figure 1 shows the principle architecture of the CBR-Answers system. The entire system is implemented in a Client-Server architecture.

Reference-contexts: Firstly, the FAllQ project has been a specific implementation providing hotline support for LHS, a company developing billing systems for telecommunication services <ref> [10] </ref>. The application scenario here is very close to the general hotline scenario as sketched in Section 2. Secondly, the ExperienceBook is a knowledge management tool on the basis of CBR-Answers for the system administrators of the Department of Computer Science at Humboldt University [6].

Reference-contexts: This is true both, for industrial equipment as well as for highly complex software systems. The reason for this is that mainte-nance costs often exceed the initial value and thus become a decision criterion of customers <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An important feature of the CRN model is that IEs may be compared in terms of similarity. Again, a proper similarity specification has to be developed during knowledge engineering. For the keywords and phrases a tool like WordNet <ref> [12] </ref> appears to be highly useful as it provides information on how different terms relate to each other. Unfortunately, WordNet is only available for English. What's more, it will not cover domain-specific terms. The specification of their relationships is again a result of a careful knowledge acquisition process. <p> The FAQFinder project [2] is probably the most similar approach to CBR-Answers. FAQFinder, too, applies CBR in combination with other techniques to document management. In particular, the goal is to answer questions by retrieving relevant FAQs from USENET news groups. It uses WordNet <ref> [12] </ref> to base its reasoning on a semantic knowledge base. A crucial difference to CBR-Answers is that FAQFinder does not focus on a specific domain.

Reference-contexts: For example, knowledge about technical devices and how they relate to each other can not be captured in a traditional thesaurus. In terms of the knowledge container model <ref> [13] </ref>, every piece of knowledge can be represented in one (or more) of the following categories: (a) the collection of cases; (b) the definition of an index vocabulary for cases; (c) the construction of a similarity measure; (d) the specification of adaptation knowledge.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is a mapping of textual parts to IEs which includes recognition of keywords and phrases, including their grammatical variations, abbreviations etc.; special functionality to identify and interpret codes, numbers and so on; a simple kind of Information Extraction <ref> [14] </ref> in order to obtain some struc tural information in the form of attribute-value pairs. An important feature of the CRN model is that IEs may be compared in terms of similarity. Again, a proper similarity specification has to be developed during knowledge engineering.

Reference-contexts: i.e. on the one hand they have to handle natural language texts, on the other hand these techniques must be flexible enough to cope with paraphrased documents which have essentially the same semantics. 2.2 Limitations of IR models When trying to recall relevant textual documents, usually Information Retrieval (IR) techniques <ref> [15] </ref> are applied. In the context of the above sketched hotline scenario, however, a major limitation of IR models is that knowledge, such as domain-specific terms and the relationships among these, can hardly be utilized when searching the document collection.
