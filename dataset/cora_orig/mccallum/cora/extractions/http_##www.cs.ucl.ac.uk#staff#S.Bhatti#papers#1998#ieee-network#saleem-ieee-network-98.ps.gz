Abstract: The CATV (cable TV) network operators hope to offer digital services and evolve their networks to FSNs (full service networks). There are many hurdles for them at the moment in the transition to a digital network and digital service offering from the current analogue based technology. Key to the success of the transition will be a well integrated and capable management system to allow the CATV operators and service providers to control the network and also the services which they will offer. The CATV operators need to agree on a common data communication infrastructure and plan how their new digital services will be offered to the subscribers without disrupting the current customer-base of analogue service users. The choice of network technology and data communication protocols will have a strong influence on the network management technology chosen. A vital element for the provision of a common, open communication architecture as well as for the purposes of network management is that the Internet Protocols are used. The adoption of existing standards is vital in order to establish a fast route to open network management for CATV networks. It is likely that CATV operators and service providers will have to integrate existing SNMP (simple network management protocol) management systems and TMN/OSI (telecommunications management network/open system interconnection) management, with newer integrated service management systems based on TINA (telecommunications information networking architecture) and implemented on a CORBA (common object request broker architecture) platform. There is a strong need to address security issues before any of these technologies can be deployed for service. There is currently investment (deployed systems and research) which uses each of the technologies mentioned, so these technologies will need to coexist. This paper highlights the differences between the North American and European network architectures and outlines the European network and network management scenario. This is based on the authors involvement in a PanEuropean CATV project, Integrated Broadband Communication over Broadcast Networks IBCoBN.

The lack of security in SNMPv1/v2 has been addressed in the SNMPv3 work <ref> [11] </ref>. With the sophisticated information services being planned and defined in an objectoriented fashion using CORBA IDL (interface definition language), such a simplistic information model as that offered by SNMP might be considered to be insufficient for the management of the application services based on CORBA.

An alternative would be to use the ATM Forums LANE <ref> [18] </ref>. This would allow coexistence of the various network protocols and promote interworking but possibly at some cost in efficiency.

Reference-contexts: So, there are proposals for offering interfaces for both types of carrier, by allowing MPEG-2-over-ATM or ATM-over-MPEG-2. An analysis of these two scenarios is presented in <ref> [19] </ref>. It seems clear that IP will play an essential part in the DAVIC model, being used for application level signalling and network management. Also, the provision of IP services for subscribers will be a major consideration.

Reference-contexts: ATM. One could consider that this is simply an interface issue why not offer ATM-over-MPEG-2 as an interface and still use MPEG-2 as the level-2 carrier?
