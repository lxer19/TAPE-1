Abstract: A simple interpolatory subdivision scheme for quadrilateral nets with arbitrary topology is presented which generates C 1 surfaces in the limit. The scheme satisfies important requirements for practical applications in computer graphics and engineering. These requirements include the necessity to generate smooth surfaces with local creases and cusps. The scheme can be applied to open nets in which case it generates boundary curves that allow a C 0 -join of several subdivision patches. Due to the local support of the scheme, adaptive refinement strategies can be applied. We present a simple device to preserve the consistency of such adaptively refined nets.

Reference-contexts: These are well defined since the auxillary edge-point rule is constructed such that both possible ways lead to the same result. 4 Convergence Analysis The subdivision scheme proposed in the last section is a stationary scheme and thus the convergence criteria of <ref> [BS88] </ref> and [Rei95] can be applied. In the regular regions of the net (which enlarge during refinement), the smoothness of the limiting surface immediately follows from the smoothness of the curves generated by the univariate four-point scheme. <p> This matrix is called the refinement matrix . After <ref> [BS88] </ref> and [Rei95] the convergence analysis can be reduced to the analysis of the eigenstructure of A. <p> For every boundary edge p q we add the extrapolated face s fl = fp; q; q fl ; p fl g. Again, the tangent-plane continuity of the resulting limiting surface can be proved by the sufficient criteria of <ref> [BS88] </ref> and [Rei95].

Reference-contexts: The rules to compute the positions of the new points use simple affine combinations of points from the unrefined net. They are derived from a modification of the well-known four-point scheme <ref> [DGL87] </ref>. <p> The natural way to define refinement operators for quadrilateral nets is therefore to modify a tensor product scheme such that special rules for the vicinity of non-regular vertices are found. In this paper we will use the interpolatory four-point scheme <ref> [DGL87] </ref> in its tensor product version as the basis for the modification. Consider a portion of a regular quadrilateral net with vertices p i;j . <p> This modification of the original scheme does not affect the convergence to a continuously differentiable limit, because the estimates for the contraction rate of the maximum second forward difference used in the convergence proof of <ref> [DGL87] </ref> remain valid. This is obvious since the extrapolation only adds the zero component 4 2 p m 1 to the sequence of second order forward differences. The main convergence criterion of [Kob95] also applies.

Reference-contexts: This is obvious since the extrapolation only adds the zero component 4 2 p m 1 to the sequence of second order forward differences. The main convergence criterion of <ref> [Kob95] </ref> also applies. It remains to define refinement rules for inner edges of the net which have one endpoint on the boundary and for faces including at least one boundary vertex. To obtain these rules we use the same heuristic as in the univariate case.

Reference-contexts: All new vertices have valency four. The major advantages that this scheme offers, are that it has the interpolation property and works on quadrilateral nets. This seems to be most appropriate to engineering applications (compared to non-interpolatory schemes or triangular nets), e.g., in finite element analysis <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. The scheme provides the maximum flexibility since it can be applied to open nets with arbitrary topology. It produces smooth surfaces and yields the possibility to generate local creases and cusps. Since the support of the scheme is local, adaptive refinement strategies can be applied.
