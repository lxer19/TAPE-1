Reference-contexts: by wireless communication media varies over an enormous range as does the wireline network bandwidth, the nature of the error rate, fading behavior, interference level, mobility issues etc., for wireless are considerably different so that the algorithms and protocols require some new and different forms from that of wireline networks <ref> (Katz, 1994) </ref> For example, the network algorithms to support wireless access are far more complex than for the wireline case; some of these are identified below.

Reference-contexts: Some of the ideas presented in this section were developed with the Nomadic Working Team (NWT) of the Cross Industrial Working Team (XIWT); the author is the chairman of the NWT (NWT, 1995) In addition, portions of this section were described in <ref> (Kleinrock, 1995) </ref> communication device; communication bandwidth. and with widespread presence of access to remote files, systems and services.

Reference-contexts: The design considerations of such cellular networks are reasonably well understood and are being addressed by an entire industry <ref> (Padgett, et. al., 1995) </ref> We discuss these no further in this paper. 3 There is however, another wireless networking architecture of interest which assumes no base stations (Alwan, et. al., 1996; Short, et. al. 1995). Such wireless networks are useful for applications that require instant infrastructure, among others.

Reference-contexts: The issues of concern, along with the needed network algorithms (shown in italics) are all of the above in Section 4.1, plus: Is there a path to your destination: Path Control; Does giant stepping <ref> (Takagi, et. al., 1984) </ref> help: Power Control; Wireless LANs come in a variety of forms.

Reference-contexts: The net result of these considerations is that the typical 7-layer OSI model for networking must be modified to account for these new considerations. For example, we must ask what kind of Network Operating System (NOS) should be developed, along with other network functions <ref> (Short, et. al. 1995) </ref> What mobility modules must be introduced to support these new services, etc. In this section we have addressed mainly the network algorithm issues, and have not focused on the many other issues involved with radio design, hardware design, tools for CAD, system drivers, etc.
