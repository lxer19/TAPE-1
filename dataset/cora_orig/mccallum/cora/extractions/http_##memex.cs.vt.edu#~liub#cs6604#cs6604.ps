Title: Web Response Time and Proxy Caching CS6604 Digital Library Class Project  
Author: by Binzhang Liu 
Abstract: In response to the request from W3C Web characterization group to do more Web characterization studies, this study characterized the Web response time. Using Webjammer developed by NRG group at Virginia Tech, four proxy log files from Digital Coporation, America Online, Virginia Tech Campus, and Virginia Tech Newman Library proxy log files were re-played. Data collected from Webjammer were analyzed using tools developed in this project. The results showed that at least one half of the total elapsed time was spent in settting up the connection. The distributions of connection time, elapsed time and file size are not normal, and skewed to the left. File size and elapsed time is positively correlated. The ratio of the connection time to elapsed time and file size is negatively correlated. Usefulness of Web proxy caching in reducing response time was examined. Contrary to the typical thought about Web proxy caching, this study found that proxy caching did not always reduce response time. Implications of these results to the designing HTTP-NG were also discussed in the paper.

Reference-contexts: Web latency comes from many sources, involving the HTTP protocol, Web Server implementation, network bandwidth, characteristics of Web documents, characteristics of Web clients and Network topology. Many techniques have been studied and used in reducing the Web latency. These approaches include Web proxy caching <ref> [1] </ref>, prefetching [2], compression [3], protocol change [4], CCS style sheets. Especially Web proxy caching has been widely used aiming reducing the Web latency.

According to Ghaleb's study [5], there are five main Web objects: client, document, network, server and proxy server. This study will investigate impacts of document object on the Web latency. 1 Recently, in an effort to design next generation HTTP protocol (HTTP-NG), the W3C group initiated a wide range of Web characterization studies.
