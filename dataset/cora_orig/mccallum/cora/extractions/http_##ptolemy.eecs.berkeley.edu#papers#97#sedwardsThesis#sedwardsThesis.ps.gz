Reference-contexts: By requiring all processes to use such blocking reads, Kahn's systems are provably deterministic. There is much more to denotational semantics. See the books by Winskel [73], Gunter [29], Stoy [65], Schmidt [60], and Allison <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1.2 Circuit Simulation Circuit simulation has traditionally proceeded along two paths. <p> The programming language semantics community is the other main source. I recommend the books by Winskel [73] (my primary source of notation) and Gunter [29]. Others include Allison <ref> [1] </ref>, the very readable unpublished book by Turbak, Gifford, and Reistad [70], and chapters in the second volume of the Handbook of Theoretical Computer Sci ence [71]. 3.2.1 Complete Partial Orders Definition 1 A partially-ordered set or poset is a set S with a partial order relation v that satisfies *x <p> Theorem 8 (Robert) If F : D !
