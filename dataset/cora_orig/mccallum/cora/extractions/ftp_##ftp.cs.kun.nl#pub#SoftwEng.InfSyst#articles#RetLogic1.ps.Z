Abstract: In this paper we consider information disclosure as a deductive process. We introduce the Disclosure Machine as a paradigm for matching user queries with characterizations of information objects. The Disclosure Machine is based on the following corner stones: logical inference for proving relevancy, plausible inference for computing relevance and proximity for balancing relevance according to object coherence (Hypertext). Next we discuss the limitations of state-of-the-art approaches, and suggest the Hyperindex Machine as an improved mechanism. This machine is based on the concept of index expressions. Such expressions provide a more complete characterization mechanism for objects. key words: Logical inference, plausible deduction, disclosure machine, index expression, power index

Reference-contexts: Finally, the two level priority scheme generally produced good structures, where "good" means that a large percentage of the (sub)expressions comprising the power index expressions were meaningful. In some cases, however, undesirable structures were produced. For more details about these cases and the transducer refer to <ref> [BB91] </ref>. 3.5 Enumeration of Index Expressions For practical purposes it is useful to have an indication the size and growth of the power index expression.

Reference-contexts: Some believe that the limits of exploitation of empirical models have been reached ([Rij86a]). Quite a considerable amount of recent research in document retrieval has been directed at incorporating document semantics in the hope to achieve more effective retrieval ([SvR90], [Wea88], <ref> [BC89] </ref>). 2.1 Formal Theories as Basis for Disclosure The crucial questions in regard to semantics in information disclosure are as to how the meaning of an object should be represented, and given that the meaning is available, how can it be used to produce more effective disclosure.

Reference-contexts: The underlying problem is that the information need of the searcher seems to be difficult to formalize. In <ref> [Bla90] </ref> research is cited which concludes that searchers can consistently determine relevance of a document without being able to concretize the criteria they use for this. This phenomenon has been compared to how people can recognize faces without being able to explain how.

Reference-contexts: The Information Disclosure Paradigm has now been established. A limited number of concepts are involved, but, nevertheless the disclosure of information turns out to be a formidable problem due to the following reasons <ref> [Bru] </ref>: * formulation is not easy * indexing produces incomplete object characterizations * matching is based on unsound assumptions The goal of this paper is to describe an improved disclosure framework which features an improved characterization mechanism and a matching process which is driven by deduction. <p> The information disclosure principle states that the content descriptors of an object must usably distinguish the object from other objects <ref> [Bru] </ref>. That the descriptors must distinguish the objects from one another is fundamental to being able to identify those objects that need to be retrieved. The descriptors must not only discriminate but also be usable with respect to the searcher. <p> The following theorems state the bounds of the size of the power index expression. For the proofs of these theorems and a discussion of other useful properties of index expressions, the reader is referred to <ref> [Bru] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Searching is thus reduced to an organized form of browsing which is an easily understood form of searching behaviour. In the context of a two level architecture of information this type of searching behaviour has been coined Query by Navigation ([BvdW90b], <ref> [Bru90] </ref>, [SDBvdW91]). For more details of how index expressions can be employed as a calculus of characterizations see [BvdW90a]. 3.4 Derivation of Index Expressions It has been observed in [BBB91] that titles of documents, section subsections and figures often have a form very similar to that of index expressions.

Reference-contexts: The first is that the accessibility relation R is given. This is the case in Hypertext object bases where the information objects are related with cross references. Another possibility is that R is derived. In one approach object clustering is used <ref> [CLCW89] </ref>. Another approach is that the coherence be derived from the plausible inference mechanism. In this regard, there are two forms of coherence; strong and weak. <p> The Hyper-index Machine is currently being implemented in the context of the Apped Esprit project (2499). Our first investigations show promising results and confirm the results of similar approaches that have shown significant improvement in disclosure effectiveness ([SvR90], [Luc90], <ref> [CLCW89] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In an index expression descriptor the relationships between the terms are modelled. The motivation behind this is that much of the content of an information object is embodied in term relationships <ref> [Far80] </ref>. A parallel can be drawn here with the conceptual model from the database world where relationship types between entities play an important role. With respect to this parallel the characterization of an object consisting simply of keywords would be like an entity relationship model with no relationship types.

Reference-contexts: In this article, we assume equivalence between a request and information need. The disclosure mechanism presented here is motivated by the work of Van Rijsbergen ([Rij86b], <ref> [Rij86a] </ref>, [Rij89]). He has recently developed a new information disclosure model in which the matching between a request an object characterization is founded on the notion of logical inference. This contrasts with state-of-the-art disclosure systems, where the matching process is driven by statistical relations between query terms and documents.

Reference-contexts: Some Boolean Disclosure Machines do not allow disjunction (and negation) to be used in requests, as the disjunction connector is typically misunderstood by searchers. This contributes to imprecise request formulations. 2.5 Coordination Machines Another well known retrieval model is the so-called coordination model <ref> [Rij86b] </ref>. Just as with the Boolean Disclosure machine, the primitive descriptors is the set of keywords K. Requests consists of a set of keywords, therefore C = 2 K . We will denote an element of C as hk 1 ; : : : ; k n i.

Reference-contexts: The most elementary form of descriptor is a keyword, or term. Term descriptors have the advantage that there are a number of straightforward indexing methods to derive them from objects <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. The disadvantage of terms is that they sometimes lack discriminatory power. This is particularly true in large object bases. A term phrase is an extension of term descriptors to increase their specificity and thus their ability for discrimination. <p> In general, a term phrase is a series of two or more terms. The most common term phrases consist of two terms. Even though straight forward indexing methods exist for the generation of term phrases <ref> [Sal89] </ref>, these methods often suffer from the problem that either too many non-meaningful phrases are generated, or conversely a large percentage of the phrases are meaningful but the resulting content models lack exhaustivity. 3.2 Index Expression Descriptors An extension to the term phrases are the so called index expressions.

Reference-contexts: Filing cabinets full of dossiers and thousands of (incompatible) word processor files abound. It is becoming increasingly difficult for organizations to control these mounds of information, let alone make effective use of it. It has been reported <ref> [Wig90] </ref> that only one percent of the information of an organization is stored online, normally in formatted databases such as relational databases. About ninety five percent of the information lies in a plethora of paper documents which grows by the day.
