Abstract: Local selection (LS) is a very simple selection scheme in evolutionary algorithms. Individual fitnesses are compared to a fixed threshold, rather than to each other, to decide who gets to reproduce. LS, coupled with fitness functions stemming from the consumption of shared environmental resources, maintains diversity in a way similar to fitness sharing; however it is generally more efficient than fitness sharing, and lends itself to parallel implementations for distributed tasks. While LS is not prone to premature convergence, it applies minimal selection pressure upon the population. LS is therefore more appropriate than other, stronger selection schemes only on certain problem classes. This papers characterizes one broad class of problems in which LS consistently out performs tournament selection.

Reference-contexts: We call local selection (LS) a selection scheme that minimizes interactions among individuals. Parallel EAs often impose geographic constraints on evolutionary search to assist in the formation of diverse subpopulations <ref> [1] </ref>. This is done to minimize the communication overhead of selection; different processors are allocated to sub-populations to minimize interprocess dependencies and thus improve efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The most notable selection variations explicitly aimed at niching are crowding <ref> [2] </ref> and fitness sharing [7]. In both of these methods, selection is altered to take into account some measure of similarity among individuals.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of selection schemes is central to evolutionary computation and closely related to the issue of convergence. In particular, the locality of a selection scheme affects both the parallelization potential and the convergence behavior of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), with efficiency and performance implications <ref> [3] </ref>. We call local selection (LS) a selection scheme that minimizes interactions among individuals. Parallel EAs often impose geographic constraints on evolutionary search to assist in the formation of diverse subpopulations [1]. <p> The removal of selection's centralized bottleneck allows for parallel EA implementations. It is also evident that LS is an implicitly niched scheme and therefore it naturally enforces the maintenance of population diversity. These factors in our opinion make LS a central issue in today's EA community <ref> [3, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Individual genotypes contain truth assignments that are randomly initialized. Point crossover is applied in this problem, with panmictic mating. A local search strategy is applied at each step; a random literal is selected from one of the unsatisfied clauses and negated. This is an optimal strategy for SAT <ref> [17] </ref>, and we also use it as a mutation operator. For LS, the energy cost charged for each evaluation is a constant. The energy benefit, however, depends on the fraction of clauses that are satisfied by the agent's truth assignment, and for which there are available resources.
