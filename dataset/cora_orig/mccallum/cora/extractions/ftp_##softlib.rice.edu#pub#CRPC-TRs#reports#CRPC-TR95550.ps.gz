Abstract: It is standard engineering practice to use approximation models in place of expensive simulations to drive an optimal design process based on nonlinear programming algorithms. This paper uses well-established notions from the literature on trust-region methods and a powerful global convergence theory for pattern search methods to manage the interplay between optimization and the fidelity of the approximation models to insure that the process converges to a reasonable solution of the original design problem. We present a specific example from the class of algorithms outlined here, but many other interesting options exist that we will explore in later work. The algorithm we present as an example of the management strategies we propose is based on a family of pattern search algorithms developed by the authors. Pattern search methods can be successfully applied when only ranking (ordinal) information is available and when derivatives are either unavailable or unreliable. Since we are interested here in using approximations to provide arguments for the objective function, our choice seems relevant.
