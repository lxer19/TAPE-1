Title: The Rhythm of Lexical Stress in Prose  
Author: Doug Beeferman

Affiliation: School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Prose rhythm" is a widely observed but scarcely quantified phenomenon. We describe an information-theoretic model for measuring the regularity of lexical stress in English texts, and use it in combination with trigram language models to demonstrate a relationship between the probability of word sequences in English and the amount of rhythm present in them. We find that the stream of lexical stress in text from the Wall Street Journal has an entropy rate of less than 0.75 bits per syllable for common sentences. We observe that the average number of syllables per word is greater for rarer word sequences, and to normalize for this effect we run control experiments to show that the choice of word order contributes significantly to stress regularity, and increasingly with lexical prob ability.

Reference-contexts: Jassem postulates that speech is composed of extra-syllable narrow rhythm units with roughly fixed duration independent of the number of syllable constituents, surrounded by variable-length anacruses. Abercrombie <ref> (Abercrombie, 1967) </ref> views speech as composed of metrical feet of variable length that begin with and are conceptually highlighted by a single stressed syllable. Many experiments lead to the common conclusion that English is stress-timed, that there is some regularity in the absolute duration between strong stress events.

Reference-contexts: While this is a difficult experiment to do automatically, we're hoping to approximate it using a natural language generation system based on link grammar under development by the author. Also, we're currently testing other data sources such as the Switchboard corpus of telephone speech <ref> (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel, 1992) </ref> to measure the effects of rhythm in more spontaneous and grammatically relaxed texts. 6 Acknowledgments Comments from John Lafferty, Georg Niklfeld, and Frank Dellaert contributed greatly to this paper.

Reference-contexts: Word-external stress regularity has been denied this level of attention. Patterns in phrases and compound words have been studied by Halle <ref> (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987) </ref> and others, who observe and reformulate such phenomena as the emphasis of the penultimate constituent in a compound noun (National Center for Supercomputing Applications, for example.) Treatment of lexical stress across word boundaries is scarce in the literature, however. <p> untrained states in new data, occur until n = 7. 3.2 Lexicalizing stress Lexical stress is the "backbone of speech rhythm" and the primary tool for its analysis. (Baum, 1952) While the precise acoustical prominences of syllables within an utterance are subject to certain word-external hierarchical constraints observed by Halle <ref> (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987) </ref> and others, lexical stress is a local property. The stress patterns of individual words within a phrase or sentence are generally context independent. One source of error in our method is the ambiguity for words with multiple phonetic transcriptions that differ in stress assignment.

Reference-contexts: This is partly because formal methods of inquiry have failed to present a compelling case for the existence of regularity <ref> (Harding, 1976) </ref>. Past attempts to quantify prose rhythm may be classified as perception-oriented or signal-oriented. In both cases the studies have typically focussed on regularities in the distance between peaks of prominence, or interstress intervals, either perceived by a human subject or measured in the signal.

Reference-contexts: Monosyllabic function words such as the and of usually receive weak stress, while content words get one strong stress and possibly many secondary and weak stresses. It has been widely observed that strong and weak tend to alternate at "rhythmically ideal disyllabic distances" <ref> (Kager, 1989a) </ref>. "Ideal" here is a complex function involving production, perception, and many unknowns. Our concern is not to pinpoint this ideal, nor to answer precisely why it is sought by speakers and writers, but to gauge to what extent it is sought. <p> The chosen sentence avoids consecutive primary stresses. Kager postulates with a decidedly information theoretic undertone that the resulting binary alternation is "simply the maximal degree of rhythmic organization compatible with the requirement that adjacent stresses are to be avoided." <ref> (Kager, 1989a) </ref> Certainly we are not proposing that a hard decision based only on metrical properties of the output is made to resolve syntactic choice ambiguity, in the case above or in general. Clearly semantic emphasis has its say in the decision.

Reference-contexts: The former class of experiments relies on the subjective segmentation of utterances by a necessarily limited number of participants|subjects tapping out the rhythms they perceive in a waveform on a recording device, for example <ref> (Kager, 1989b) </ref>. To say nothing of the psychoacoustic biases this methodology intro duces, it relies on too little data for anything but a sterile set of means and variances.

Reference-contexts: Degrees of stress arise from variations in the amount of energy expended by the speaker to contract these muscles, and from other factors such as intonation. Perceptually stress is more abstractly defined, and it is often associated with "peaks of prominence" in some representation of the acoustic input signal <ref> (Ochsner, 1989) </ref>. Stress as a lexical property, the primary concern of this paper, is a function that maps a word to a sequence of discrete levels of physical stress, approximating the relative emphasis given each syllable when the word is pronounced. <p> Though prose rhythm inquiry is more than a hundred years old <ref> (Ochsner, 1989) </ref>, it has largely been dismissed by the linguistic community as irrelevant to formal models, as a mere curiosity for literary analysis. This is partly because formal methods of inquiry have failed to present a compelling case for the existence of regularity (Harding, 1976). <p> Pauses in the text arise not only from semantic constraints but also from physiological limitations. These include the "breath groups" of syllables that influence both vocalized and written production. <ref> (Ochsner, 1989) </ref>. The results for these experiments are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Expectedly, adding the symbol increases the confusion and hence the entropy, but the rates remain less than a bit. The maximum possible rate for a ternary sequence is log 2 3 1:58.
