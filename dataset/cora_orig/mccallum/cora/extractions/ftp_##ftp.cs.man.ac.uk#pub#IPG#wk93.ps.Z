Abstract: The business process is increasingly topical as more and more companies become interested in initiatives such as business process reengineering. But what is it really all about? And what are the implications for I.T? The authors have worked with companies that are at the forefront of process oriented working. They argue that a discipline of process engineering, backed up by advanced modelling and support technologies, can help businesses in a competitive environment Think of any office in any business and the chances are that you will picture a number of people around desks. They may be writing reports, perhaps using computers, or on the telephone, talking, drinking coffee, tapping keyboards or writing notes. What is fundamental to our research is the way in which people work, not just as individuals but as teams coordinating with each other towards the achievement of some goal. The word process is one which you may have come across a lot recently. Certainly there are increasing numbers of user groups with interests such as business process reengineering, and business process redesign. Moreover the Management In The 1990s initiative [SM90] encourages businesses to use I.T. in a way which enables the adoption of innovative business processes. What can all this interest in processes give us? Our experience suggests that a process orientation can help to produce: Furthermore we see a concern for the process as an ongoing activity, a part of management in fact. That is why later in this article we introduce the notion of a process engineer.
