Reference-contexts: Global lighting effects, such as inter-object reflections, refraction and shadows could thus not be simulated. Striving for more reality, additional techniques appeared such as texture mapping, bump mapping [Newell] [Catmull] [Blinn] and shadow determination algorithms <ref> [Atherton] </ref> [Kelly] [Crow]. However, the boundary of feasibility in terms of realism was reached and owing to the growing computer performance researchers began to focus on global illumination models. These take the above mentioned illumination effects between objects into account.

Reference-contexts: It is called radiosity because the methods they used were first developed in the 1950s for computing radiant interchange between surfaces, e.g. for radiator and boiler design. Those early algorithms have been refined and now there are numerous radiosity methods known and applied. In 1988, <ref> [Cohen] </ref> introduced a progressive refinement approach addressing the computational complexity by allowing fast approximate solutions to be displayed. Progress in N-body research led to a hierarchical method formulated by [Hanrahan] in 1991, yielding a linear time algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, researchers try to diminish execution times not only on the algorithmic but on the hardware level as well. Radiosity algorithms can effectively be run on parallel computers. Almost all approaches to parallel radiosity like [Schaufler] [Sindlar] [Langer] and <ref> [Feda] </ref> use progressive refinement because the data dependencies are more suitable to parallel computation. Although huge knowledge on the subject has already been gained there is still some research going on, e.g. a research group at the University of Bristol led by [Stuttart] is aiming at real time radiosity rendering.

From the many existing books on radiosity, <ref> [Wallace] </ref> has been chosen as it provides a fundamental introduction along with very useful insights into mathematical backgrounds and implementation matters. 1 3 Specific Problem Statement 3.1 Introduction Radiosity is a considerably sophisticated illumination model and involves quite a few delicate mathematical and computational subtleties.

Reference-contexts: However, the boundary of feasibility in terms of realism was reached and owing to the growing computer performance researchers began to focus on global illumination models. These take the above mentioned illumination effects between objects into account. The first applicable model was introduced by <ref> [Whitted] </ref> in 1980 and called recursive ray tracing. It is primarily based on the physical behavior of light rays; how they are reflected, transmitted or absorbed by objects made of different materials. The resulting spectacular images inspired growing interest in photorealism.
