Abstract: This paper presents a variation of the introductory computer science curriculum that I first introduced at my liberal arts institution in 1993. The core idea is the full integration of the contents of our Computer Science 1 (CS 1) and discrete mathematics courses into a two-semester sequence of computer science, mathematics, and programming. Motivation for this curricular reorganization came from the fact that the artificial separation of the relevant mathematics from the computer science material for which it was directly applicable was frustrating for both students and faculty. The solution my department chose, and I designed and implemented, was to interweave the syllabi of CS 1 and discrete mathematics, placing the mathematics with the computer science material for which it was relevant. This approach resulted in greater acceptance of the mathematics on the part of the students, mathematical skills in place when they were needed, and better preparation for CS 2. The drawbacks of the approach were minimal, and were logistical rather than intellectual consequences of the non-traditional organization. fl This work was carried out while I was on the faculty in The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Middlebury College. I thank Matthew Dickerson for the original idea of combining the material in our discrete mathematics and introductory computer science courses, and for joint discussion of topic lists for the new sequence.

Reference-contexts: students, but no new purchase the second semester. 4 Discussion and Conclusions In the Model Curriculum for Liberal Arts Colleges, Gibbs and Tucker emphasize the essential role that mathematics plays in the development of computer science, both for the particular knowledge and for the reasoning skills associated with mathematical maturity <ref> [ Gibbs and Tucker, 1986 ] </ref> . To achieve the mathematical contribution, they recommend inclusion of two mathematics courses in the undergraduate curriculum: one in discrete mathematics, and a second course in either discrete mathematics, calculus, or linear algebra.

Reference-contexts: The CS 1A - CS 1B introductory sequence is also consistent with the idea that discrete mathematics should come early, but goes one step further by teaching it together with the CS 1 material. Ralston <ref> [ Ralston, 1984 ] </ref> also stresses the importance of certain mathematical concepts for computer science. He presents a comprehensive table of mathematics topics and their computer science applications, and recommends a one-year course in discrete mathematics, taken concurrently with introductory computer science.

Reference-contexts: Still, this curriculum is in the spirit of Ralston's suggestion. The Liberal Arts Computer Science (LACS) Consortium has recently suggested revisions to the Model Curriculum for Liberal Arts Colleges <ref> [ Walker and Schneider, 1996 ] </ref> .
