Abstract: In this article we illustrate some novel procedures of using Sinc methods to compute solutions to three types of medical problems. The first of these is a novel way to solve optimal control problems. the second is a novel way to reconstruct images for X-ray tomography, and the third is a novel way to do ultrasonic tomography inversion. Each of these procedures uses Sinc convolution, which is a novel computational procedure for obtaining accurate approximations to indefinite convolutions.

Reference-contexts: A linear combination of plane wave sources u (r) = S p with S R 2 . Both sources, (3.31) and (3.32), satisfy (3.26) in H.. It was shown in <ref> [2] </ref> for the two dimensional case, that the one dimensional integral equivalent of (3.32) does indeed reduce to a Sinc function source for the case when z = z 0 , S is suitably selected finite interval, and !() 1, and moreover, it was shown in that same article, that the

Reference-contexts: Most of these results and their proofs may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>; we include these results (but without their proofs here for sake of completeness. Our manner of description of the methods is in symbolic form. <p> we restrict the time t to a finite interval, (0; T ), via the map t (t) = log fT t=(T t)g. 3.2 X-Ray Tomography Computation We present here an algorithm for X-ray tomography which is based on discretizing the exact convolution that relates the backprojected image to the image <ref> [3] </ref>. This exact convolution can be accurately approximated via Sinc convolution. The present method may have advantages over others, since the method of filtering the backprojection has not been favored because of the longer reconstruction times and the poor quantitative results when compared with the filtered backprojection algorithm [7,10].

Reference-contexts: Carrying out X-ray tomography inversion. The development of accurate X-ray imaging took many years of "fine tuning" and alterations of the original procedure, which is based on a difficult to approximate Fourier transform. A recent method based on Sinc approximation <ref> [5] </ref> yielded a highly efficient algorithm which without fine tuning was almost as good as those of the best existing algorithms, and which has the potential of being more efficient and producing more accurate pictures than existing algorithms. 3.

Reference-contexts: For example, engineers are now discovering that wavelets provide accurate and efficient tools for solving partial differential equations, although one rarely finds a paper that shows why wavelets are so accurate. In the text <ref> [8] </ref> we find clear explanations of why Sinc methods are accurate for solving partial differential equations. It is also easy to show that wavelet methods are accurate for solving partial differential equations if and only if Sinc methods are accurate for solving such problems. <p> Theorem 2.5 If f = 0 2 L ff;fi (D), then kJ f m A m V m f k C" N ; (2.14) Sinc indefinite integration is the basic approach used in <ref> [8] </ref> to solve initial value problems over finite, semi-infinite, or infinite intervals.

We now proceed to discretize Equation (3.8) as outlined in Example 2.7. <p> Of course, our reason for wanting Sinc function sources are that they are highly accurate approximations to delta functions, i.e. (see <ref> [8, Eq.

Once the c m have been selected in this manner, we can next turn to the selection of v (), and while this selection is somewhat more complicated, we can nevertheless suitably select the function v such that, e.g., u is an approximate two-dimensional delta function.
