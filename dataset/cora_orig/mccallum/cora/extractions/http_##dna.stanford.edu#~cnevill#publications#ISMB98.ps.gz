Abstract: Statistical decision theory provides a principled way to estimate amino acid frequencies in conserved positions of a protein family. The goal is to minimize the risk function, or the expected squared-error distance between the estimates and the true population frequencies. The minimum-risk estimates are obtained by adding an optimal number of pseudocounts to the observed data. Two formulas are presented, one for pseudocounts based on marginal amino acid frequencies and one for pseudocounts based on the observed data. Experimental results show that profiles constructed using minimal-risk estimates are more discriminating than those constructed using existing methods.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, our experimental results suggest that accurate frequency estimates indeed appear to improve the discriminatory power of profiles. Moreover, our results indicate that the observed data may be more important than was previously thought. Previous studies <ref> [7, 1] </ref> have suggested that prior information should be weighted relatively heavily. For instance, the constant method uses 50 pseudocounts, and the unique-multiple method uses 5 to 100 pseudocounts.

Reference-contexts: We randomly divided each block into a training set and test set. We used the unique-multiple method to create a profile for each training set, and used the profile to rank each sequence in the swissprot 32 database <ref> [2] </ref> according to its profile score. The ranking was converted to an equivalence number, which is the rank where the number of true positives with 7 lower scores equals the number of false positives with higher scores [12]. The true positives were simply the sequences in the test set.

Reference-contexts: Some sequences were considered neither true positives nor false positives, namely, those sequences that were in the training set, and those that were not in the test set but noted by prosite 13.0 database <ref> [3] </ref> to be in the family. Of the 3417 blocks, 2408 had an equivalence number of zero. This meant that the test set was easy to separate from non-family members.

Reference-contexts: However, most choices for K have had little theoretical rationale. In this paper, we provide a theoretical basis for choosing the number of pseu-docounts, using statistical decision theory <ref> [4] </ref>. We adopt a squared-error loss function, and choose the estimate that minimizes expected loss, or risk. We obtain two different solutions, depending on whether the pseudofrequencies are marginal (data-independent) or empirical (data-dependent). <p> The estimate p fl is obtained by adding a multiple K of the pseudofrequencies to the observed counts or frequencies ^ p. (Adapted from <ref> [4] </ref>.) 2.2 Marginal Pseudocounts When the pseudofrequencies are constants, then it can be shown that the risk function in equation 4 becomes R (p; K) = i=1 K 2 (p i i ) 2 + N (p i p 2 (K + N ) 2 (5) which follows from using values <p> Nevertheless, we can estimate K fl by using a plug-in technique. We can use the observed frequencies (or maximum likelihood estimate) ^ p as an estimate for p. This single plug-in gives a simple estimate for K fl <ref> [4] </ref>: ^ K fl = P 20 i i=1 (X i N i ) 2 4 Alternatively, we can use an iterative series of plug-ins. Once we plug-in an estimate for p, we obtain an estimate for K fl , as above.

Reference-contexts: Among the three methods, the unique-multiple method produced the best results, as measured by searches using profiles. Furthermore, the unique-multiple method performed slightly better than the Dirichlet mixture method for making profiles <ref> [5] </ref>. and by the minimum-risk method. As the figure shows, the minimum-risk method produces a wider range of values for K. When amino acids are relatively well conserved, K is fractional.

Reference-contexts: Accurate estimates of amino acid frequencies are useful not only for characterizing a protein family, but also for classifying a given protein for possible membership in the family. Amino acid frequencies are the basis for computing weight matrices [15] and profiles <ref> [6] </ref>, which are essentially log-odds representations of frequencies. Accurate frequency estimates are also central to hidden Markov model [10] and Gibbs sampling [11] methods in computational biology. <p> In order to use these frequencies for practical tasks in computational biology, we often convert them into profiles. Profiles represent amino acid frequencies as log-odds ratios. (Alternatively, frequencies can be multiplied by a score matrix, as proposed by Gribskov <ref> [6] </ref>.) In the log-odds approach, each frequency estimate p i , yields a score log (p i =q i ), where q i is the marginal frequency for amino acid i. A multiple sequence alignment therefore yields a matrix of scores called a profile.

Reference-contexts: The conditional frequencies are taken from data on amino acid substitutions, such as the pam or blosum substitution matrices. Allowing prior probabilities to depend on the data is generally called an empirical or pseudo-Bayesian approach; in computational biology, this idea has also been called a "position-specific" approach <ref> [7] </ref>. The second issue, the number of pseudofrequencies, is more controversial. Previous approaches have chosen K to be the square root of N , a large constant number, or a multiple of the number of unique amino acid residues observed [16, 7]. <p> The second issue, the number of pseudofrequencies, is more controversial.

Reference-contexts: When they are not well conserved, K is large. 3.2 Selection of Test Data We selected a set of multiple sequence alignments to use as test data for cross-validation studies. Our alignments were chosen from the blocks 9.3 (March 1997) database <ref> [8] </ref>, which contains 3417 alignments. In order to select test data that was sufficiently challenging, we performed a preliminary study. We randomly divided each block into a training set and test set.

Reference-contexts: The marginal frequencies were taken from the overall frequencies of amino acids in the swissprot 32 database. We also used four sources of pseudofrequencies : marginal pseudocounts and three sets of empirical pseu-docounts, using the frequencies from the blosum30, blosum62, and blosum100 substitution matrices <ref> [9] </ref>. Each combination of and K constituted a distinct method for estimating frequencies. For each method, we ran a cross-validation study. A cross-validation study consisted of creating a profile for each training set and then computing the equivalence number for the corresponding test set.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, some methodology must be introduced to estimate the true, non-zero frequencies, and to augment the small number of observed counts. The standard methodology for estimating amino acid frequencies is to add pseu-docounts to the observed counts <ref> [14] </ref>. Equivalently, we may postulate a set of pseud-ofrequencies , and add a multiple K of these pseudofrequencies to the observed counts. Then, our population estimates are simply the frequencies of the combined counts. <p> The two issues that must be resolved, then, are the source of the pseudofrequencies and the number K of them to be added. The first issue, the source of the pseudofrequencies, has been addressed relatively well in the literature <ref> [14] </ref>. One source of pseudofrequencies is the set of marginal frequencies of amino acids over all protein sequences. We refer to these frequencies as the marginal or data-independent pseudofrequencies, because they are independent of the observed counts.
