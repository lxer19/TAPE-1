Abstract: This paper deals with multicasting in an internetwork with mobile hosts, particularly with regard to Mobile-IP [11] and Distance Vector Multicast Routing (DVMRP) [10, 9] protocols. When the source of a multicast datagram is a mobile host (MH), the datagram may not reach all group members to which the datagram is addressed, including other mobile hosts. When the source is a static host and the multicast group includes mobile hosts, a mobile group member may receive datagrams in one cell but not in another. Further, when a MH enters a cell which contains no other member of the same group, the MH will experience a delay before it starts receiving datagrams addressed to that group. Mobility between campuses, which result in a MH acquiring an additional unicast address, also has an effect on multicast routing. We propose enhancements to DVMRP executed at the Mobility Support Routers (MSR) that ensure correct forwarding of multicast datagrams to and from mobile hosts. Our solutions do not require any change at hosts and routers unaware of mobility, i.e. the modifications are limited to MSRs and MHs. We also describe an implementation incorporating a subset of our proposals. Lastly, we show that alternate styles of multicasting or mobile networking, viz. link-state (MOSPF [14]) and IETF proposal[1], will face similar problems and our proposed solutions are still valid in their context.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, we extend our solution to handle inter-campus moves. Though our discussion of multicasting to/from mobile hosts is based on DVMRP and Mobile-IP, the problems and our proposed solution therein are also applicable to other styles of multicasting, viz. MOSPF or PIM, and mobile networking, viz. the IETF proposal <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem of reliably delivering multicast messages to mobile hosts at the application-layer is discussed in [2]. <p> The IETF Mobile IP proposal <ref> [1] </ref> is not constrained to use a reserved subnet for mobile hosts. The IETF model allows a mobile host to directly make a link-layer connection to a wired subnet (without any intermediary foreign agent), and acquire a transient address belonging to that subnet.

Reference-contexts: MOSPF or PIM, and mobile networking, viz. the IETF proposal [1]. The problem of reliably delivering multicast messages to mobile hosts at the application-layer is discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. This work is not concerned with routing multicast messages to mobile hosts, but instead uses application-layer protocols to determine the set of MSRs that support members of a multicast group and to ensure that a mobile host does not receive multiple copies of the same message from different cells.

Reference-contexts: Out of the proposed protocols, arguably the most widely used scheme is Mobile-IP from Columbia University [11, 12] and the only one for which, a publicly available implementation exists.

This paper will therefore focus on extending multicast protocols to mobile hosts assuming the addressing and (unicast) routing mechanisms of Columbia's Mobile-IP.

Reference-contexts: Our solution to the above problem consists of healing the partition amongst the MSRs using a pre-defined multicast tunnel. This multicast tunnel is used to simulate the necessary link-layer connectivity amongst the MSRs. This abstraction, along with appropriate modifications to the Internet Group Membership Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [7] </ref>, is adequate to ensure correct routing of multicast datagrams from mobile hosts to all group members, and also to ensure that a MH experiences no delay in receiving data 1 grams regardless of its mobility within the campus. This solution has been implemented for DVMRP/mrouted executed by the MSRs. <p> We solve this problem by modifying the Internet Group Membership Protocol <ref> [7, 10] </ref> (IGMP) for the mobile subnet as follows: each MSR sends a separate membership query to its local cell, but the group-specific membership reports received in response from local MHs are sent to all other MSRs via the multicast tunnel. <p> MSRs. to sending membership queries and collecting member ship reports for the mobile interface: a) If an IGMP host membership report is received from an interface that is marked mobile, this report is encapsulated and sent over the MTUNNEL in addition to taking any action locally as dictated by IGMP <ref> [7, 9] </ref>.
