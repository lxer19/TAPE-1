As a rule, the restriction on probability distributions is satisfied in natural cases, but it may conceivably be violated if instances of are generated by an adversary. Ben-David, Chor, Goldreich and Luby studied more general samplable distributions <ref> [BCGL] </ref>. Impagliazzo and Levin showed that, for appropriately generalized reductions, problems complete for RNP remain complete for the more general class [IL]. For simplicity, we stick here to the original restriction. On a set of nonzero finite cardinality m, the uniform probability distribution assigns the probability 1=m to each element.

Reference-contexts: Andreas Blass <ref> [Bl] </ref> showed that an operator T on SL 2 (Z) is linear in that sense if and only if there are matrices B and C such that either T (X) = BXC for all X or else T (X) is the transpose of BXC for all X. <p> We will see in the next section that I is AP. The isomorphism J is P-time computable but P PM does not dominate P BS with respect to J and thus J fails to reduce BS to PM. Theorem 3.2 <ref> [Bl] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: QED The second statement of Lemma 3.1 implies that the monoid generated by the matrices A and B is free. This fact is noticed in <ref> [Ei, Chapter VI, Section 12] </ref>. The following theorem should be known too, but we don't have an appropriate reference. Theorem 3.1. The monoid PM is isomorphic to the monoid BC of binary strings. The two indecomposable nonunit elements are the matrices A and B of Lemma 3.1. Proof.

We believe in the latter alternative. <p> Upper bounds on the minimal appropriate values of oe and c come from the proof of the average-case completeness of Randomized Post Correspondence Problem in <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. In particular, the bound on oe is something like 3 times the number of instructions of a universal Turing machine. The bounds were irrelevant in [Gu1], and one should be able to improve them if necessary. <p> bounds on the minimal appropriate values of oe and c come from the proof of the average-case completeness of Randomized Post Correspondence Problem in <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. In particular, the bound on oe is something like 3 times the number of instructions of a universal Turing machine. The bounds were irrelevant in [Gu1], and one should be able to improve them if necessary. One can get rid of n as a separate constituent and assume, for example, that n = jAj. And of course one can make oe variable. <p> for some " &gt; 0, P Here the sum is over elements x of positive size and P [x] abbreviates P [fxg].

Definition. A domain D is regular if there exists a polynomial p (n) such that, for every n, the probability of the event fx : jxj = ng is either zero or bounded by 1=p (n) from below. <p> All specific domains in this paper will be regular. The following lemma allows the convenience of dealing with instances of one size. Lemma 2.1 <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. Let D be a regular domain and P n [x] be the conditional probability P [x j jxj = n]; if Pfx : jxj = ng = 0, let P n [x] = 0. <p> Then dominates if there exists a function g, polynomial on -average, such that (x) g (x) (x). Lemma 2.3. If dominates and T is polynomial on -average then it is polynomial on - average. A proof of Lemma 2.3 may be found in <ref> [Gu1, Section 1] </ref>. The term used there is "weak domination"; the term "domination" is restricted in [Le, Gu1] to the case when g is polynomially bounded. Definition. <p> Lemma 2.3.

RNP (for "Randomized NP") is the class of randomized NP problems such that the probability distribution of is dominated by a polynomial time computable distribution [Le,Gu1]. <p> Theorem 4.1. Some RMC (oe; c) is RNP-complete. Remark. Replacing PM with BS in the definition of RMC (oe; c) gives a variant RPCP (oe; c) of the Post Correspondence Problem which is RNP-complete for not too small oe and c <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. If we ignore probabilities and deal with decision problems only then the isomorphism J of Section 3 gives rise to a polynomial time reduction of RPCP (oe; c) to MC (oe; c). <p> Lemma 4.3. For a certain U , RWH (U ) is RNP-complete. Proof. Some RBH (T ) is RNP-complete, by Corollary 1 of Theorem 4.1 in <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. (Actually, a slightly different version of bounded halting problems was considered in [Gu1]. It was supposed there that n &gt; jxj and P [(x; n)] / n 3 2 jxj .

However the same proof works. <p> The computation time of that algorithm is proportional to jI (X)j. By Lemma 4.2, I (X) is AP-time. The composition of a P-time function X = f (x) and an AP-time function I (X) is an AP-time function I (f x) <ref> [Gu1, Lemma 1.2] </ref>. Thus, h is AP-time. It remains to check that h has the domination property, namely, that P BS (x) fi P ! (n) is dominated by P PM (f (x)) fi P ! (gx + n). <p> QED Fix a Turing machine U witnessing Lemma 4.3. We will reduce RWH (U ) to RMC (oe; c) for appropriate oe and c. The variant RPCP (oe; c) of the Post Correspondence Problem was defined in a remark above. According <ref> [Gu1, Section 5] </ref>, there exists a P-time reduction F (x; n) = (xx 0 ; K (x); p (n)) of RBH (U ) to some RPCP (oe; c) where jx 0 j c log jAj. Extend the isomorphism J to sequences of pairs of binary strings. <p> MD 0 (oe; c) is flat in the sense of <ref> [Gu1] </ref> where it is proved that no flat r.d.p. can be RNP-complete with respect to deterministic reductions of Section 2 unless deterministic exponential space equals nondeterministic exponential space. To prove the completeness of MD 0 (oe; c), we use randomizing reductions [VL]. <p> To prove the completeness of MD 0 (oe; c), we use randomizing reductions [VL]. A simple way to introduce them was indicated in <ref> [Gu1] </ref>. Definition. Let be a randomized decision problem with a domain D, and let p be a P-time computable function from D to natural numbers. <p> Remark. Instead of setting n = jAj, one can set n = (jAj) where is any P-time computable nondecreasing function such that the inverse function 1 (j) = min i [(i) j] is polynomially bounded; see <ref> [Gu1, Section 9] </ref> in this connection.

The length of the encoding string becomes the size of the encoded instance. We find it more convenient to define the size of a problem instance directly.
