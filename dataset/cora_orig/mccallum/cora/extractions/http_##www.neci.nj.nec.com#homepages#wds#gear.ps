Abstract: Gear theory is re-examined and we find optimal shapes for gears. As optimality criteria, we allow: (1) minimal frictional losses (highest efficiency) assuming linear law of friction or (2) uniform maximum stress (it will wear out slowly and last the longest) assuming Hertzian contacts or (3) uniform maximal temperature, assuming we are in a high power limit in which all heat is removed by the lubricant. Some other criteria which have been used before are that (4) mis-spacing the gears still yields perfect gear action with the desired speed ratio or (5) minimal vibration in the low friction limit. Both (4) and (5) lead to "involute gears" which are the standard in engineering practice. Criteria 1, 2, and 3 lead to apparently new gear-tooth forms. We manage to describe these curves with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and for each of these 3 criteria we find the ODE for both spur (cylinder) and bevel (conical) gears, i.e. a total of 6 ODEs.

Experiments reported by Buckingham <ref> [2] </ref>, pages 404-414, on lubricated cast iron spur gears indicate that an "effective coefficient of friction" is dependent on, and increases with, pitch circle speed. For example in one experiment, Buckingham (page 404) found = 0:0112 at 150ft/min, = 0:0385 at 2100 ft/min, and = 0:0517 (stationary).

Reference-contexts: By imposing no-sliding, we have excluded from consideration "worm" drives, crossed helices (again), and "nuts and bolts." (The latter also violate the pure-rotation condition.) All of these excluded gear types are comparatively innefficient since they have comparatively large frictional losses. Typical efficiencies <ref> [5] </ref> achieved in practice with bevel (cone), and spur (cylinder) gears are 97-99.7%. Hyperboloid, worm gears, and crossed helices tend to have much smaller efficiencies, 50-95%. <p> I do not know what these people did, and I have been unable to obtain these books. The contemporary book most renowned for its theoretical content is Buckingham's [2]. Others include [8], <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> For example in one experiment, Buckingham (page 404) found = 0:0112 at 150ft/min, = 0:0385 at 2100 ft/min, and = 0:0517 (stationary). Similar experiments reported by Dudley <ref> [5] </ref> found similar results with varying within the range 0:017 0:061 with various different grades of oil and pitch circle speeds from stationary to 5000 ft/min. <p> An empirical equation given by Buckingham to "explain" this is = c 2 exp (c 1 p c 3 V . Dudley's experiments seem to indicate less rapid and smaller variations in than Buckingham's experiments. Meanwhile, experiments on lubricated worm gears reported in <ref> [5] </ref>, page 14-10, indicate that the effective coefficient of friction drops with increasing pitch circle velocities (up to 1000 ft/min), apparently asymptotically to V p where 0:5 &lt; p &lt; 1. All in all, friction is little understood.

According to <ref> [9] </ref> in the year 65 15 BC, a large ship was wrecked which carried a sun-moon-planets computing machine containing &gt; 20 bronze gears including crown, spur, and planetary. Girard Desargues (1591-1661) invented and made cycloidal gears, the first system of interchangeable spur gears.
