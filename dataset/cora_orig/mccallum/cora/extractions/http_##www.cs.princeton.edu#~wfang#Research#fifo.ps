Title: Contention and Queueing in an Experimental Multicomputer:  
Keyword: Message passing, Interconnection networks, Arbitration policies, Performance modelling techniques.  
Abstract: Analytical and Simulation-based Results Abstract Communication performance is an important component of overall application performance in many parallel programs. As a result, parallel machine implementations must offer efficient support for programs whose communication requirements often vary in several dimensions, including send rate, granularity of communicated data, and destination patterns. As part of our effort in designing and implementing the XYZ 1 Multicomputer we have developed two models one using analytic methods and one using event-driven simulation - to evaluate its communication performance under a variety of workloads. We find that the system's performance depends mostly on the behavior of the endpoints, with most of the message latency due to arbitrating and transferring data to and from memory on the node I/O buses. While the raw speed of the network is a less important factor in message latency, network connectivity and arbitration policies can greatly affect the extent to which congestion at a receiver node backs upstream and affects other nodes. Furthermore, by studying specific different communication patterns in isolation, we are able to identify particular important performance effects. One such effect which we refer to as self-throttling is a type of natural flow control occurring in our machine when all-to-all communication patterns are used. Overall, this research both (i) quantifies some of the interesting performance effects and design decisions in a parallel machine and (ii) provides an interesting case study in the development of two related performance models.

Reference-contexts: The cost and engineering effort required to build a parallel machine make performance prediction important. This paper presents and compares the results of two performance prediction methods - analytic modeling and event-driven simulation for predicting the performance of the XYZ multicomputer <ref> [2] </ref>. Using both methods, we study the behavior of the system under different communication patterns and report on system performance parameters such as message latency, occupancy of system buffers, and network congestion. The contributions of this work are two-fold. <p> Section 7 discusses some of the insights gained from the study, and Section 8 offers conclusions. 2 Background: The XYZ Multicomputer The XYZ project studies how to provide high-performance communication mechanisms in order to integrate commodity desktop computers such as PCs and workstations into inexpensive, high-performance multicomputers <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. Our goal is to provide a low-latency, high-bandwidth communication mechanism whose performance is competitive with or better than those used in specially designed multicomputers. its interconnection network.

Reference-contexts: Figure 13 shows the average message latency in the system when all parameters remain at the defaults, but the I/O bus speed is increased to 132 MBytes/s the bandwidth of the PCI bus <ref> [6] </ref>. Throughput is no longer limited by the bus bandwidth of the destination node. It is now limited by the network speed, since all messages must pass through the single network link connecting the destination node to the network backplane.

Reference-contexts: The current XYZ nodes are unmodified 66MHz Pentium PC systems, each configured with disk and standard commodity devices such as tape drives, monitors, keyboards and LAN adaptors. The current network is the Intel Paragon mesh routing backplane <ref> [8] </ref>. The connection between a network interface and the routing backplane is via a simple signal-conditioning card and a cable. A main focus of the design work has been on the network interface. The network interface is designed to support fast, user-level, memory-to-memory data transfers.

Reference-contexts: The simulator is built using the Mint simulation package <ref> [10] </ref>. Mint supports program-driven execution. In it, interesting events in a parallel program (such as memory references and synchronization) are sent to a simulator "back-end", that simulates the timing behavior of the machine being studied.
