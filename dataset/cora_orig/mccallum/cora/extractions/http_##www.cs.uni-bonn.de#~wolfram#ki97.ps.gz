Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in the field of mobile robotics is the estimation of the robot's position in the environment. Position probability grids have been proven to be a robust technique for the estimation of the absolute position of a mobile robot. In this paper we describe an application of position probability grids to position tracking. Given a starting position our approach keeps track of the robot's current position by matching sensor readings against a metric model of the environment. The method is designed to work with noisy sensors and approximative models of the environment. Furthermore, it is able to integrate sensor readings of different types of sensors over time. By using raw sensor data, the method exploits arbitrary features of the environment and, in contrast to many other approaches, is not restricted to a fixed set of predefined features such as doors, openings or corridor junction types. An adaptable sensor model allows a fast integration of new sensings. The results described in this paper illustrate the robustness of our method in the presence of sensor noise and errors in the environmental model.

Reference-contexts: The problem of estimating the robot's position can be divided into two sub-problems: the estimation of the absolute position in the environment and the tracking of the robot's position relative to a given starting point <ref> [1] </ref>. The task of the tracking techniques is the correction of accumulated dead reckoning errors caused by the inherent inaccuracy of the wheel encoders and other factors such as slipping. <p> Finally, Section 5 describes different experiments in typical office environments. 2 Related work Different techniques for the tracking of the position of mobile vehicles by matching sensor readings with maps of the environment have been developed in the past (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a comprehensive overview). Recently, more and more probabilistic techniques are applied to position estimation problems. These approaches can be distinguished according to the type of maps they rely on.

Reference-contexts: Such a grid provides a discrete approximation of the probability function of the robot's current position. The approximation is adapted by integrating the likelihoods of sensor information over time. These likelihoods are computed by matching the measurements against a given environmental model. In <ref> [3] </ref> we showed that this technique allows a mobile robot to determine its absolute position in typical office environments within a short time. In this paper we describe a specialization of the position probability grid approach to the tracking problem. <p> Finally, the increased number of parameters in the discrete state space results in more accurate representations of the position probability density than obtained with Kalman filters. 3 Position tracking with position probability grids The position probability grid approach <ref> [3] </ref> initially has been designed to estimate the global position of a mobile robot in its environment. The basic idea of this approach is to provide a discrete approximation of the position probability density function for the given environment. <p> Since this likelihood has to be estimated for each possible position x of the robot, the necessary computation time has a high impact on the efficiency of the overall approach. In <ref> [3] </ref> we applied an approach similar to Moravec's [10] for estimating the probability that a sensor measures a certain distance. One disadvantage of this approach, however, lies in its computational complexity. <p> In such situations the accumulated dead reckoning errors cannot be corrected due to the lack of features detectable by the proximity sensors. To deal with such cases, we are currently working on a combination of this fast tracking approach with our global position estimation technique described in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although this sensor model, in contrast to the original model introduced by Moravec and Elfes [10], has only a small number of parameters, we obtained a significant speed up which results in a better positioning performance for global localization as well as position tracking. In <ref> [4] </ref> we successfully utilized this model even for active self-localization of mobile robots. 5 Experimental results The grid-based tracking technique described above has been implemented and extensively tested. The current system is able to interpret sensor readings of ultrasonic sensors and match them with occupancy probability grid maps.

Reference-contexts: The local map is matched with the global map to produce a position and orientation estimate. This estimate is combined with the previous estimate using a Kalman filter <ref> [9] </ref>, where the uncertainty is represented by the width of the Gaussian distribution. Compared to the approach of Wei et al., this technique allows the integration of different measurements over time rather than taking the optimum match of the most recent sensing as a guess for the current position.

Reference-contexts: Since this likelihood has to be estimated for each possible position x of the robot, the necessary computation time has a high impact on the efficiency of the overall approach. In [3] we applied an approach similar to Moravec's <ref> [10] </ref> for estimating the probability that a sensor measures a certain distance. One disadvantage of this approach, however, lies in its computational complexity. For each location x one has to compute a generally not Gaussian probability density function over a discrete set of possible distances measured by the sensor. <p> Because of a compact representation of the expected distances in a table only two lookup operations are necessary to compute the likelihood of a given sensing at runtime. Although this sensor model, in contrast to the original model introduced by Moravec and Elfes <ref> [10] </ref>, has only a small number of parameters, we obtained a significant speed up which results in a better positioning performance for global localization as well as position tracking.
