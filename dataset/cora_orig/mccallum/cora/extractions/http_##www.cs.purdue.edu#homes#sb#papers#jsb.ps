Abstract: New methods are described that facilitate high-resolution (5-10 A) image reconstructions from low-dose, low-contrast electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated specimens and processing of large, digital images produced by new imaging devices and modern electron microscopes. Existing techniques for automatic selection of images of individual biological macromolecules from electron micrographs are inefficient and unreliable. We describe the Crosspoint method (CP) which produces good quality solutions with relatively small miss rates and few false hits and an extension of this method along with a procedure for refining its solution. Two algorithms for processing large images, one based on image sub-sampling, the other on image decomposition, are described. A large image is first compressed (e.g., by sub-sampling) and the CP method is applied to the compressed image to produce an initial solution. The information gathered at this stage is used to cut the original image into sub-images and then to refine the particle coordinates in each sub-image. An interactive environment for experimenting with particle identification methods is described.

Reference-contexts: The problem of determining the specimen structure from the micrographs is equivalent to the problem of reconstructing a density distribution from its projections. Fourier theory provides a simple approach to finding the 3D structure of an object from its projections.

Reference-contexts: From electron micrographs (Figure 1 (a)) which contain many different projections of identical macromolecules (e.g.virus particles), it is possible to produce a spatial model of the structure of an average particle (Figure 1 (b)), <ref> [3] </ref>. The three-dimensional (3D) model of a specimen is normally represented as a density function sampled at the points of a regular grid. The images of individual particles in electron micrographs are projections of the specimen in the direction of the electron beam.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to transform the image so that a pixel no longer contains gray level information, but a magnitude and direction representing the severity and orientation of the local gray-level change. Gradient operators have been widely used for edge detection <ref> [7] </ref> . A local derivative (gradient) is computed at every pixel in the image. Regions of constant intensity yield a null gradient, whereas varying regions are characterized by non-zero derivatives. <p> gradient of an image I at pixel (x; y) is a vector: 5I = 6 I x 3 5 = 6 6 6 6 @I @I 3 7 7 7 5 A special case of gradient operators are the Sobel operators which have both a differencing and a smoothing effect <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> The time complexity of various algorithms used by this method is n, where n represents the number of pixels in the digitized micrograph. This method is described in detail in [10]. The main steps are summarized below. 2.3.1 Image Enhancement The digitized micrograph is first enhanced by histogram equalization <ref> [7] </ref>, then the resulting image is averaged to smooth out small regions of high intensity. High-resolution 3D reconstructions require closer-to-focus, i.e., low-contrast images in which the high resolution details are not destroyed by the electron beam.

The main steps are summarized below. 2.3.1 Image Enhancement The digitized micrograph is first enhanced by histogram equalization [7], then the resulting image is averaged to smooth out small regions of high intensity. <p> The result of the marking phase is a binary image. Each pixel is considered to belong either to a particle projection (marked, set to 1) or to the background (not marked, set to 0). In the original CP method <ref> [10] </ref> the image is scanned horizontally, row by row from top to bottom. Pairs of pixels at distance r+1 are compared and the difference between the intensity values of the pixels in such a pair is tested against a threshold value. <p> Clustering is the second phase of the particle identification algorithm. It determines the clusters, i.e., the connected components in the binary image resulting from the marking phase. Two algorithms, one based on a coloring scheme and the other on a depth-first search, are described in <ref> [10] </ref>. For each cluster we compute its size and the center of mass and filter out clusters that are too large or too small compared with the expected area of the projection (see x3.2 and [10]). The center of mass of each cluster approximates the corresponding particle center. <p> based on a coloring scheme and the other on a depth-first search, are described in <ref> [10] </ref>.

The application of CP2 to the micrograph in Figure 11 is 18 shown in Figure 14. 2.3.3 Postprocessing A particle identification method is affected by two types of errors: (a) missed particles, and (b) false hits. <p> The original automatic particle identification method, the Crosspoint or CP, is described in <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The 3D Fourier transform of the particle is calculated from experimental values on central sections. The values of the 3D transform must be sampled at the points of a 3D regular grid and this requires interpolation methods <ref> [11] </ref>. The last step is to compute the electron density function from the 3D Fourier transform by an inverse Fourier transformation. Boxing, the first step in the 3D reconstruction procedure, is generally performed by a manual selection process. <p> In this context, manual boxing methods become impractical. The need for computer-aided particle detection methods provides the motivation for our work. At high magnification, noise in electron micrographs of unstained, frozen-hydrated macromolecules is unavoidable <ref> [11] </ref> and makes automatic detection of particle positions a challenging task. Variability in the background support film of the specimen sample and radiation damage are two major sources of noise.

Reference-contexts: Clearly the values of the intensities alone are incapable of defining which portions of the line lie inside particles and which of them lie in the background. 2.2 Template Matching Template matching methods have been proposed by several groups, [9], [5], <ref> [13] </ref>, [16]. In this method a reference (template) particle is selected from the micrograph and cross-correlated with the entire image, see Figure 8. <p> Peaks in the correlation pattern (i.e., values of the correlation coefficient larger than a particular threshold) identify the locations of regions in the micrograph most similar to the template and, in the ideal case, correspond to the centers of the particle projections. Olson and Baker <ref> [13] </ref> proposed a two-cycle template matching algorithm in which the peaks detected after the first correlation cycle are sorted according to their magnitude, the particle projections corresponding to the strongest peaks are averaged, and the average is used as a new template in the second cycle of the algorithm. <p> Results produced by the CP2 method for a micrograph which contains a mixture of two types of virus particles is shown in Figure 16. In this example, the smaller particles were the ones being boxed in. The larger particles were included solely for calibration purposes <ref> [13] </ref>. The image is particularly noisy, a large portion of the carbon film obscures the lower left corner, and the variation of the background intensity is clearly visible. <p> A second, background equalization, method was tested but did not produce good results. 3.1 Correlation Based Refinement of Particle Centers This algorithm was inspired by the template matching algorithms <ref> [13] </ref>, [16], but it is more efficient and accurate. Let C be the number of particles detected using the CP2 method and let r be the radius of the particles. <p> Provided the number of false hits and of missed particles is small, a model particle built by averaging all the C particles is more accurate than one constructed manually by selecting one or few particles as described in <ref> [13] </ref>. The model can be cross-correlated with the points of the entire scanned image, but restricted to a limited a search region. We take advantage of the accuracy of the CP2 solution by restricting this region to a small area around the center of each of the C particles.

Reference-contexts: Histogram equalization is the only transformation affected by decomposition. By applying histogram equalization to sub-images an improved contrast is obtained in each sub-image, closer to the optimal image contrast that would be achieved by using, for instance, the adaptive histogram equalization technique described in <ref> [14] </ref>. In contrast to the complex "cutting" and "sewing" described in [16], the only requirement of the method proposed here is that each sub-image include a border region to allow for correct averaging, clustering and box migration during the refinement stage for all particles inside.

Reference-contexts: It is estimated that approximately 2000 particle images are necessary for the reconstruction of a virus with a diameter of 1000 A at 10 A resolution <ref> [16] </ref>.
