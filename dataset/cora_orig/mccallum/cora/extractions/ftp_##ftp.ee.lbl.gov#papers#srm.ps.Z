Abstract: This paper 1 describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The SRM framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, which has been used on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided the SRM design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.

Reference-contexts: To avoid keeping all the data forever, the sequencer keeps track of the receiving state of all the members to determine the highest sequence number that has been correctly received by all the members. MTP (Multicasting Transport Protocol) <ref> [AFM92] </ref> is again a centralized scheme for totally ordered multicast delivery. A master site is responsible for granting membership and tokens for data transmission; each host must obtain a token from the master first before multicasting data to the group, thus the total order of data packets is maintained.

Reference-contexts: The reliable multicast delivery in existing ISIS implementations is achieved by multiple unicast connections using a windowed acknowledgment protocol similar to TCP <ref> [B93] </ref>. Horus, the successor to ISIS, can optionally run on top of IP multicast. There is also a growing literature on the analysis of reliable multicast schemes. As one example, [BMT94] considers the performance of one-to-many reliable multicast with a block-based ACK scheme.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most well-known work on reliable multicast is the ISIS distributed programming system developed at Cornell University <ref> [BSS91, ISIS] </ref>. ISIS provides causal ordering and, if desired, total ordering of messages on top of a reliable multicast delivery protocol.

Reference-contexts: As another approach to bandwidth adaptation, receivers could reserve resources where such network services were available; an example of such services are the guaranteed and controlled load services currently being developed for the Internet <ref> [BCS94] </ref>. Session members can decide individually whether to reserve resources or to rely on best effort service for a session | the use of services other than best-effort need not be uniformly imposed on all members of a multicast group.

As one example, <ref> [BMT94] </ref> considers the performance of one-to-many reliable multicast with a block-based ACK scheme. The paper investigates the regime where transfer sizes are large and receivers have limited buffering, and shows that in this case throughput is significantly higher if the transport layer can deliver packets to the application out-of-order.

Reference-contexts: The combined slotting and damping techniques proposed in [XTP92] to reduce NACK suppression have been described earlier in the paper. In XTP receivers or routers can impose a maximum data rate and maximum burst size on the sender. The Reliable Broadcast Protocol (RBP) of Chang and Maxemchuk <ref> [CM84] </ref> is one of the pioneer works in many-to-many reliable multicast protocols. RBP is a centralized scheme that provides totally ordered delivery of data to all group members. All the members are ordered in a logical ring, with one designated the master "token site".

Reference-contexts: The weakness of "one size fits all" protocols has long been recognized. In 1990 Clark and Tennenhouse proposed a new protocol model called Application Level Framing (ALF) which explicitly includes an application's semantics in the design of that application's protocol <ref> [CT90] </ref>. ALF was later elaborated with a light-weight rendezvous mechanism based on the IP multicast distribution model, and with a notion of receiver-based adaptation for unreliable, real-time applications such as audio and video conferencing. <p> Thus the "naming in application data units (ADUs)" model works far better for multicast. Use of this model also has two beneficial side effects. As <ref> [CT90] </ref> points out, a separate protocol namespace can impose delays and inefficiencies on an application, e.g., TCP will only deliver data in sequence even though a file transfer application might be perfectly happy to receive sectors in any order.

Reference-contexts: Because of the "fate-sharing" implicit in unicast communication, i.e., the data transmission fails if either of the two ends fails, either the sender or receiver can take on this role. In TCP, the sender times transmissions and keeps retransmitting until an acknowledgment is received. NETBLT <ref> [CLZ87] </ref> uses the opposite model and makes the receiver responsible for all loss detection and recovery. Both approaches have been shown to work well for unicast. However, if a TCP-style, sender-based approach is applied to multicast distribution, a number of problems occur.
