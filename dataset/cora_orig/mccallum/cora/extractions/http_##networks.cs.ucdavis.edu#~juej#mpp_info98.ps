Abstract: Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) local-area networks based on the optical passive-star coupler have traditionally been classified as being either single-hop or multihop. A single-hop network provides a direct connection between the source and the destination of a packet during the packet transfer duration, but may require some amount of coordination between the nodes which may involve tuning of the transmitters or receivers at each node. Since the time required to tune a tunable optical transmitter or receiver may be high, a single-hop network may incur significant overhead. On the other hand, a typical multihop network requires little or no tuning, but a packet may traverse a number of intermediate nodes between the source and destination nodes. Each hop incurs additional queuing delays at each node and also increases the overall load on each link and on the network. In this paper, we propose a new class of multiconfiguration mul-tihop protocols (MMPs) which use tunable transmitters and receivers to cycle through a number of configurations which together make up a multihop logical topology. This class of protocols offers a trade-off between the tuning required in a single-hop network and the number of hops required in a multihop network. We present a generalized framework for comparing the proposed protocols with existing single-hop and multihop protocols, and we show that these protocols may offer significant performance gains for systems with high tuning delays and a limited number of transmitters and receivers at each node.

Reference-contexts: The practicality of this approach is limited by the high cost of optical transmitters and receivers. 2. Channel sharing: The second method for providing connectivity in a WDM PSC network is to reduce the number of channels in the network, and allow channel sharing <ref> [1] </ref> [2]. By limiting the number of channels in this manner, multiple transmitters and receivers from different nodes can be made to occupy the same channel, thus creating a greater number of direct connections between nodes. <p> Another extension to this work is to introduce channel sharing. With channel sharing, the number of channels, w, is less than the number of nodes. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it has been shown that channel sharing increases the connectivity of the network by using fewer channels. The study assumed a single fixed transmitter and a single fixed receiver per node.

Reference-contexts: Also, tunable components generally cost more than non-tunable components depending on the technology used to build the components. The concept of using a number of different network configurations over time has been previously studied for mesh networks <ref> [3] </ref> and for networks with centralized switches [4], but has not been applied to PSC networks in which nodes are equipped with tunable components. In summary, a network may be characterized by its degree of connectivity, specified by the nodal degree and the methods by which it achieves this connectivity.

Reference-contexts: In either case, some amount of coordination is required. This coordination may be provided either through a separate control channel, or through the use of in-band signaling over the data channels (see, for example, <ref> [7] </ref>). The case in which the logical topology changes infrequently is a straightforward extension of the static protocol. It may be implemented by having each node accumulate traffic in-formation over a period of time, and then having the nodes exchange this information at predetermined intervals.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [8] </ref>, the problem of finding an optimal logical topology for a given traffic matrix and a given physical topology is addressed. However, in our case, we are not constrained by a physical topology, nor is the logical topology constrained by the number of transmitters or receivers at each node. <p> We can then modify the problem statement in <ref> [8] </ref> to accommodate networks in which multiple configurations are employed to create a logical topology. <p> Given: Traffic matrix Receiver tuning time Number of transceivers per node Objective: Minimize average packet delay Design variables: Logical topology c: Number of configurations K: Duration of each configuration Composition of each configuration (transmitter and receiver tuning schedule) Such topological optimization problems have been shown to be hard to solve <ref> [8] </ref>. In this work, we will simplify the problem by assuming that the traffic matrix is uniform, and that each node is equipped with one fixed transmitter and one tunable receiver (FT-TR). Since the traffic matrix is uniform, we will consider only regular logical topologies.

Reference-contexts: Since the traffic matrix is uniform, we will consider only regular logical topologies. One class of regular logical topologies which is scalable and is able to accommodate an arbitrary nodal degree is GEMNET <ref> [9] </ref>. GEMNET also compares favorably to other classes of topologies in terms of average hop distance. 3.4 Configuration Design Once a logical topology is selected, another issue to consider is how to partition the logical topology into individual configurations, and how long the network should remain in any given configuration. <p> An (x; y; z) GEMNET has x columns, y rows, and a nodal degree of z (see Fig. 8 for an illustrative example). We select one or two columns for the GEMNETs since these configurations yield the lowest average hop distances <ref> [9] </ref>. The details of each logical topology are given in Table 1. In these examples, we also assume that the propagation delay is negligible, since we are considering a local-area network environment. The analytical results are verified through simulation.
