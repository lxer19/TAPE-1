Abstract: We are interested in using low degree-of-freedom robots to perform complex manipulation tasks by not grasping. By not grasping, the robot can use rolling, slipping, and free flight to control more degrees-of-freedom of the part. To demonstrate this we study the controllability properties of planar dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. We show that almost any planar object is small-time locally controllable by point contact, and the controlling robot requires only two degrees-of-freedom (a point translating in the plane). We then focus on a one joint manipulator (with a two-dimensional state space) and show that even this simplest of robots, by using slipping and rolling, can control an object to a full-dimensional subset of its six-dimensional state space. We have developed a one joint robot to perform a variety of dynamic tasks, including snatching an object from a table, rolling an object on the surface of the arm, and throwing and catching.

Reference-contexts: Erdmann [7] studied minimal sensor design based on a task description. Bicchi and Sorrentino [4] demonstrated minimalist dextrous manipulation by rolling an object between two flat palms. Our previous work on 1JOC (1 Joint Over a Conveyor) (Akella et al. <ref> [1] </ref>) is closely related to the work described in this paper. 1JOC uses a sequence of pushes by a single joint robot to position and orient parts coming down the conveyor in random configurations. <p> Proof: We consider the system (Lewis and Murray [10]) (q; _ q ) = X 0 (q; _ q ) + u 1 X 1 (q; _ q ) + u 2 X 2 (q; _ q ); where u 1 ; u 2 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, and the bracket terms X 3 = [X 0 ; X 1 ]; X 4 = [X 0 ; X 2 ]; X 5 = [X 1 ; [X 0 ; X 2 ]]; X 6 = Now we give some definitions necessary to apply Suss-mann's [22] sufficient condition

Reference-contexts: The problems studied in this paper are related to the controllability of a planar free-flying robot with gas jets, a forced planar rigid body (Lewis and Murray [10]), a hovercraft (Manikonda and Krishnaprasad [16]), or an unactuated link of a robot arm (Arai <ref> [2] </ref>). One distinguishing feature of nonprehensile manipulation is that contact forces are unilateral, while most controllability analyses assume bidirectional controls. An exception is the work by Goodwine and Burdick [8] based on Sussmann's [22] general theorem on local controllability. <p> Proposition 5 addresses small-time local controllability in zero gravity, and is relevant to controlling the position and attitude of a free-flying planar robot with gas jets, a hover-craft with a single rotating thruster (Manikonda and Krish-naprasad [16]), or an unactuated joint of an underactuated manipulator (Arai <ref> [2] </ref>). Proposition 5 In the absence of gravity, the object O is small-time locally controllable about any state (q; 0) if the set of force directions ^ F positively spans a great circle of the force sphere that does not lie in the t = 0 plane.

The proof of Proposition 3 is straightforward and can be found in (Lynch <ref> [11] </ref>). This is the familiar condition for a force closure grasp of a planar object; the difference is that for a grasp, all contacts are simultaneously active.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we study controllability properties of planar dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. The results parallel our previous results on the controllability of quasistatic pushing (Lynch and Mason <ref> [13] </ref>), but now we have second-order dynamics and there is no support friction resisting motion of the object.

Reference-contexts: This comes at the expense of increased complexity in planning and control. Planning for pick and place manipulation requires only a kinematic model of the world; dynamic manipulation requires a dynamic model. In a previous paper (Lynch and Mason <ref> [15] </ref>) we addressed the planning problem for dynamic nonprehensile manipulationhow to choose manipulator trajectories to achieve the desired motion of the object via nonlinear coupling through the nonprehensile contact. In this paper we study controllability properties of planar dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. <p> The planned trajectories have been successfully implemented on the one joint robot. An example rolling task is shown in Figures 8-10. Details on the planner and experiments can be found in (Lynch [11]; Lynch and Mason <ref> [15] </ref>; Lynch and Mason [12]). 6 Conclusion We have shown that by not grasping, a one joint robot can exploit centrifugal and Coriolis forces to control the motion of a planar part.

We can also apply results concerning the number of fingers (respectively controls) sufficient for force closure (respectively small-time local controllability), with and without friction at the contacts, but they are not listed here because their application is direct.

Reference-contexts: The planning problem is to find an arm trajectory to take the object to a goal state using a sequence of manipulation phases, including dynamic grasp, slip, roll, and free flight (Figure 7). (A dynamic grasp is defined as a robot acceleration that keeps the object fixed against it <ref> [18] </ref>.) By sequencing these phases, we can control more degrees-of-freedom of the object. We have cast the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization.
