Abstract: Region Inference is a technique for inferring lifetimes of values in strict, higher-order programming languages such as Standard ML. The purpose of this paper is to show how ideas from Milner's polymorphic type discipline can serve as a basis for region inference, even in the presence of a limited form of polymorphic recursion.
