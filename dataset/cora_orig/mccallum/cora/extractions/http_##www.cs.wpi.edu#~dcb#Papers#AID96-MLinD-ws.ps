Abstract: This research originates in the work started several years ago at Worcester Polytechnic Institute dedicated to the investigation, modelling and evaluation of multi-agent based design. The main thrust behind our approach was the idea of finding the elementary patterns of agent problem-solving and interaction in design tasks. To achieve this goal we introduced and defined the concept of Single Function Agents (SiFAs) [Dunskus et al, 1995]. SiFAs are agents specialized to perform one single function during the design process. Some typical functions would be to select, evaluate, and provide critique. The SiFA concept is generic and agents can be instantiated for different, particular design domains. This introduces the other two important characteristics of SiFAs: the unique target on which they operate and the unique point of view from which they perform their task. In parametric design the targets are represented by design parameters. For example, a Selector (function) can be specialized to choose materials (target) with good corrosion resistance (point of view). SiFAs helped us analyze what functions are needed in specific design situations, what types of knowledge are associated with each function, and what kind of information is exchanged between various pairs of agents. They also allow new approaches to conict resolution and to negotiation over design decisions. Conicts might occur when agents have different preferences over the same issues. Single Function Agents have proven to be particularly useful in detecting the basic factors which inuence design decisions and design solutions in a concurrent engineering approach. Learning adds additional power for agents to deal with real design problems. In this context learning is needed for several important reasons. First, it can adapt a system to the domain and to the design problems it has to solve. And, no less important, it can adapt the agents to each other, to make the problem-solving process smoother. Therefore, learning targets two levels in each agent: the level of its domain knowledge and the level of its interaction knowledge (fig.1). In this paper we intend to analyze some of the ingredients of learning specific to a multi-agent design system. The considerations presented so far suggest that it is necessary to establish a set of dimensions under which to consider possible learning patterns. Modelling multi-agent design in terms of primitive agent functionality (SiFAs) provided us with the means to accurately explore cooperation in design. In a similar way, these learning dimensions are intended
