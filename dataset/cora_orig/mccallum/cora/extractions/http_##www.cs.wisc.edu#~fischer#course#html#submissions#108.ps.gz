Abstract: We have presented a two-level language approach to object level programming and put forth the motivation and a basis for a theoretical development applying intelligent syntax trees to object level programming with multiagent AI methods. New linguistics constructs are put forth for object level programming with abstract data types. [1] Nourani, C F."Abstract Implementations By Computing Agents: A Conceptual Overview," METAAI, Inc.
