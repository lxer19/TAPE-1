Abstract: We study the following problem: two agents are connected to each other by independent binary symmetric channels of crossover probabilities p and q. They wish to generate common randomness by communicating interactively over the two channels. Neither agent has access to any external random sources, so that any randomness generated must come from the noise on the two channels. We show that it is possible to generate common randomness in this situation at a rate (in bits per step) of R fl (p; q) = min fh(p) + h(q); 2 h(p) h(q)g. We also prove a strong converse which establishes R fl (p; q) as the common randomness "capacity" of this pair of channels.
