Abstract: We consider two level overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition methods for solving the finite element problems that arise from discretizations of elliptic problems on general unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions. Standard finite element interpolation from the coarse to the fine grid may be used. Our theory requires no assumption on the substructures which constitute the whole domain, so each substructure can be of arbitrary shape and of different size. The global coarse mesh is allowed to be non-nested to the fine grid on which the discrete problem is to be solved and both the coarse meshes and the fine meshes need not be quasi-uniform. In addition, the domains defined by the fine and coarse grid need not be identical. The one important constraint is that the closure of the coarse grid must cover any portion of the fine grid boundary for which Neumann boundary conditions are given. In this general setting, our algorithms have the same optimal convergence rate of the usual two level overlapping domain decomposition methods on structured meshes. The condition number of the preconditioned system depends only on the (possibly small) overlap of the substructures and the size of the coarse grid, but is independent of the sizes of the subdomains.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. Unstructured grids are very popular, and extra flexible to allow for complicated geometries and the resolution of fine scale structure in the solution <ref> [1] </ref>, [18]. However, this flexibility may come with a price. Traditional solvers which exploit the regularity of the mesh may become less efficient on an unstructured mesh. Moreover, efficient vectorization and parallelization may require extra care. <p> In the case of mixed boundary conditions, we prescribe homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition for x 0:2 and homogeneous Neumann boundary condition for x &gt; 0:2: A uniform triangulation using linear finite elements is used. The coarse grid is defined on the square [0; 1 + fi] fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. If fi is less than zero we are not covering the right edge of the fine grid, see Fig. 2. Note that only when fi = 0 do we have a nested coarse grid space. 14 fi &lt; 0 Fig. 2.
