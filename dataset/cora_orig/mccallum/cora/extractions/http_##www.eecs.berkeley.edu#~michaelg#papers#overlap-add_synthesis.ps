Abstract: In overlap-add synthesis of sinusoidal partials, amplitude modulation distortion can occur in the overlap region if the partial frequencies in successive frames differ. The frame-to-frame frequency changes can be accommodated by synthesizing linearly time-varying sinusoids (chirps) in adjacent frames. In this paper we present a new approach to chirp synthesis in which the distortion is eliminated by using a succession of chirp rates in each frame for each partial.
