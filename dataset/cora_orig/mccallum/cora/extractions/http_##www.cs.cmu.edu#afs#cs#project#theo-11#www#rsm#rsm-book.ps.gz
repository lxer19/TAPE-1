Abstract: We describe an information seeking assistant for the World Wide Web. This agent, called Web-Watcher, interactively helps users locate desired information by employing learned knowledge about which hyperlinks are likely to lead to the target information. Our primary focus to date has been on two issues: (1) organizing WebWatcher to provide interactive advice to Mosaic users while logging their successful and unsuccessful searches as training data, and (2) incorporating machine learning methods to automatically acquire knowledge for selecting an appropriate hyperlink given the current web page viewed by the user and the user's information goal. We describe the initial design of WebWatcher, and the results of our preliminary learning experiments.

Reference-contexts: In interactive mode, WebWatcher acts as a learning apprentice <ref> [Mitchell et al., 1985, Mitchell et. al., 1994] </ref>, providing interactive advice to the Mosaic user regarding which hyperlinks to follow next, then learning by observing the user's reaction to this advice as well as the eventual success or failure of the user's actions.

Reference-contexts: We have experimented with a variety of representations that re-represent the arbitrary-length text associated with pages, links, and goals as a fixed-length feature vector. This idea is common within information retrieval retrieval systems <ref> [Salton and McGill, 1983] </ref>. It offers the advantage that the information in an arbitrary amount of text is summarized in a fixed length feature vector compatible with current machine learning methods. It also carries the disadvantage that much information is lost by this re-representation. <p> If p 1 ; :::; p n are the individual probabilities, and I is the set of indexes for which a bit is set in a given test vector, then the probability that the corresponding link was followed is determined by 1 Q * TFIDF with cosine similarity measure <ref> [Salton and McGill, 1983, Lang, 1995] </ref> is a method developed in information retrieval. In the general case at first a vector V of words is created. In our experiments it is already given by the representation described above.

Reference-contexts: In order to explore possible learning approaches and to determine the level of competence achievable by a learning agent, we applied the following four methods to training data collected by WebWatcher during 30 information search sessions: * Winnow <ref> [Littlestone, 1988] </ref> learns a boolean concept represented as a single linear threshold function of the instance features. Weights for this threshold function are learned using a multiplicative update rule. In our experiments we enriched the original 530 attributes by a transformation.

Reference-contexts: were selected by first gathering every distinct word that occurred over the training set, then ranking these according to their mutual information with respect to correctly classifying the training data, and finally choosing the top N words in this ranking. 3 Mutual information is a common statistical measure (see, e.g., <ref> [Quinlan, 1993] </ref>) of the degree to which an individual feature (in this case a word) can correctly classify the observed data. 3.3 What Learning Method Should be Used? The task of the learner is to learn the general function U serChoice?, given a sample of training data logged from users.
