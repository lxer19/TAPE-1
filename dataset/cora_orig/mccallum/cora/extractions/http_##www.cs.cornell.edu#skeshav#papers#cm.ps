Abstract: Most current schemes for multicast routing assume that multicast routers participate both in forwarding mul-ticast packets and in control algorithms for routing, resource reservation, and group management. By separating data and control flow, and by centralizing control in distinct control elements, we have designed a simple and scalable approach to IP multicast that we call Centralized Multicast. We present the details of our approach, a proof of its correctness, analysis of its performance, and a discussion of its advantages over current schemes.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the number of forwarding entries at each router increases linearly both with the number of multicast groups and the number of potential senders in each group. This limits the scalability of the multicast protocol. An alternative approach, discussed in <ref> [AP96] </ref>, uses the notion of an io-set. An io-set entry is of the form fG, interface listg, where the interface list consists of the interfaces that take part in multicast forwarding for group G. <p> On receiving a join request, the ID of the joiner is compared with the list of allowed participants. If the joiner is not a member of the access-control list, the join request is denied. This is similar to the notion of "closed groups" in <ref> [AP96] </ref>. If the creator of a group specifies that the group may have non-local members, the gateway sends a message to the root controller with its ID, its domain ID, the Class D address of the multicast group, and an indication whether admission to the group is restricted. <p> To regain optimality, root controllers could periodically reconfigure the multicast tree. They can do this by using a make-then-break approach (similar to the tree switching algorithm described in <ref> [AP96] </ref>). That is, the new tree is created by adding new multicast routing entries (and tunnels) to the tree. Old entries and tunnels are deleted only after the new tree is fully established. In the transition period, routing loops may form, and some destinations may receive duplicate packets. <p> Thus, this approach, when judiciously applied, allows the backbone to be asynchronously reconfigured with little extra effort. Similar benefits of periodic recomputation of the multicast tree are shown in <ref> [AP96] </ref>. 4 Reservation Although we view CM as primarily a scheme for mul-ticast routing, it can be extended to provide per-stream or per-aggregate quality of service by carrying out reser-vations and admission control. To do so, we will need the following assumptions. <p> If the primary dies, the backup takes over as the primary and establishes another backup. A gateway implemented in this fashion therefore survives the failure of the primary (though not the failure of the router). A similar approach to fault-tolerance has been used in <ref> [AP96] </ref>. More elaborate techniques for fault-tolerance based on atomic broadcast and virtual synchrony can deal both with process and router failure, and are well-known in the literature [BR94].

Reference-contexts: We believe that this lack of efficiency has resulted in the relative paucity of multicast applications and multicast-capable routers in the Internet. Other proposals in the literature, such as CBT <ref> [B93, BFC 93] </ref> and PIM [DEF+ 94, DEF+ 96] also fail one of the three criteria (we discuss these failings in more detail in Section 7). In contrast, we propose a centralized approach to multicast that we show is efficient, scalable, and incrementally deployable. <p> For instance, with the DVMRP approach [D88, D89], every multicast capable router must agree not only to forward multicast packets (i.e. those packets with Class D addresses that correspond to previously established multicast groups), but also participate in the DVMRP protocol. The CBT <ref> [B93, BFC93] </ref> and PIM [DEF+94, DEF+96] approaches have similar requirements. We believe that requiring routers to participate in both data forwarding and control algorithms results in adding substantial complexity to routers. <p> Thus, if a gateway crashes, though existing multicast groups remain unaffected, no new join and leave requests can be processed. Therefore, CM requires gateways to be fail-proof. Fortunately, we can use a variety of standard techniques to prevent the crash of a gateway <ref> [BJ87, B93, BR94] </ref>. For instance, we can implement the gateway as a reliable process group. In this approach, gateway functionality is provided by a set of processes that use a hard-coded mul-ticast group to keep in tight synchrony. <p> The largest term here is the O (SM) term, since this term grows with the size of the network, independent of the size of a multicast group. That is why flood-and-prune is rather inefficient for sparse multicast groups, as pointed out in References <ref> [B93, BFC93] </ref>. Note that flood-and-prune simultaneously joins all receivers. Thus, it does not have a per-receiver join cost, reducing its overall cost when a multicast group is dense. 6.2.2 CBT The Core Based Tree approach is more efficient in its operation.

Reference-contexts: BGMP builds a bi-directional shared tree in the backbone and allows the grafting of shortest-path branches. However, BGMP still needs help from MASC [EHT97] for allocation of blocks of multicast addresses for aggregation and from MBGP <ref> [BCKR97] </ref> for distribution of multicast address prefixes between domains. CM can achieve the same goals of BGMP, MASC and MBGP using its gateways and root controllers except that CM separates control and data while they do not.

We believe that requiring routers to participate in both data forwarding and control algorithms results in adding substantial complexity to routers. <p> This construct saves space in the routing tables, at the expense of forcing all packets in the multicast group to traverse a shared multicast tree (as in the CBT approach <ref> [BFC93] </ref>). Thus, scalability is gained at the expense of a decrease in optimality (see Part (a) of Figure 4 for an example where the io-set approach forces the formation of a shared tree which saves forwarding table space, but creates a non-optimal multicast tree). <p> The largest term here is the O (SM) term, since this term grows with the size of the network, independent of the size of a multicast group.

The JOIN message has the following options: 1.

Reference-contexts: Current algorithms for IP multicast fail one or more of these three criteria. For example, the flood and prune approach in the current MBONE <ref> [D88] </ref> is inefficient for sparse groups because packets are flooded to all routers, even those that are not interested in the group. We believe that this lack of efficiency has resulted in the relative paucity of multicast applications and multicast-capable routers in the Internet. <p> In contrast, we propose a centralized approach to multicast that we show is efficient, scalable, and incrementally deployable. Our approach to multicast routing derives from the following observation. Traditional multicast routing algorithms require routers to participate in both data movement and control algorithms. For instance, with the DVMRP approach <ref> [D88, D89] </ref>, every multicast capable router must agree not only to forward multicast packets (i.e. those packets with Class D addresses that correspond to previously established multicast groups), but also participate in the DVMRP protocol.

Here, the new member H informs the IGMP querier router (Rt-y) that it wants to join group G using IGMP <ref> [D89] </ref>. Rt-y sends a Join (G,Flag) message to the gateway where Flag=1 if the new member thinks it is the first member of the group. Otherwise, Flag=0. In this example, we assume the existence of group G (shown by the multicast tree connecting sender S and receivers R1 through R3).

Reference-contexts: This allows robust recovery from root controller crashes at the expense of messaging overhead. Root controllers periodically exchange state with each other on a pre-established multicast group (similar to ALL-PIM-ROUTERS group in PIM <ref> [EFH+97] </ref> for example), thus allowing them to stay in loose synchrony.

Reference-contexts: By allocating a new group present in this domain a multicast address in the range 225.1.3.*, routing tables in the backbone need a single forwarding entry for the aggregated address. This is similar in concept to the MASC proposal <ref> [EHT97] </ref>. In this step, a gateway normally contacts the closest root-controller and waits indefinitely for an acknowledgement. We now introduce two optimizations to improve performance and robustness. First, a gateway is allowed to contact any root-controller with a join request. <p> A recent contender for multicast routing, Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP) [TEM97], is being developed in IETF as the inter-domain multicast routing protocol. BGMP builds a bi-directional shared tree in the backbone and allows the grafting of shortest-path branches. However, BGMP still needs help from MASC <ref> [EHT97] </ref> for allocation of blocks of multicast addresses for aggregation and from MBGP [BCKR97] for distribution of multicast address prefixes between domains. CM can achieve the same goals of BGMP, MASC and MBGP using its gateways and root controllers except that CM separates control and data while they do not.

Reference-contexts: The basic action of a host is to join or leave a multicast group. Hosts may discover the Class D IP address of the group in a variety of ways. The address may be given to the host using a session directory (as in sd <ref> [J94] </ref>), or found in a centralized server, such as in a web server that lists currently known multicast groups.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, decentralized control necessarily leads to well-known problems with distributed state such as the lack of global knowledge, the need for synchronization of state, and, frequently, the need to live with non-optimal solutions <ref> [L96] </ref>. Our approach, therefore, (a) decouples data movement and control and (b) centralizes control in special control elements. The control elements are arranged in a two-level hierarchy, corresponding to the control of multicast routing within and between Autonomous Systems (or do 1 mains).
