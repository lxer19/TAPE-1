Abstract: Numerous approaches to verifying the safety of vehicles in the AHS architecture of PATH have been proposed (see [1] and [2]). One approach involves finding a boundary between safe and unsafe initial conditions. This task is significantly easier if we can guarantee that the severity of an accident is monotonic in the initial conditions. Simulation results are presented in which it is shown that this condition does not hold for the design of [1], and a hybrid automaton model explaining this situation is presented. Finally, some attempts to modify the control laws to obtain monotonicity are presented.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider a lane change scenario and its effect on the adaptive cruise control law used by the leader of every platoon as a default longitudinal law. The longitudinal control law presented in <ref> [1] </ref> applies linearizing feedback to the nonlinear dynamics of the car, so that the engine jerk (i.e. the rate of change ?

Research supported by a University of California Regents Fellowship and <p> We as-sume that at time t the controller can observe the entire state (x i (t); _x i (t); x i (t)) of car i as well as the relative distance and relative velocity of the preceding car. The objective of the cruise control law described in <ref> [1] </ref> is to follow the preceding car, car i 1, at a safe distance, given by an affine function of the velocity. This is achieved by using a switched mode controller that switches between different feedback control policies depending on which region of the state space the system is in. <p> by: d 2 6 z 1 z 3 3 7 2 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 7 2 6 z 1 z 3 3 7 2 6 0 0 3 7 2 6 0 0 3 7 u specifies the switched cruise control law of <ref> [1] </ref>. Note that the system has some constraints, due to the actuator saturation limits. In particular, the car cannot move backwards ( _x i 0), it cannot brake faster than 5m/s 2 (x i 5) and it cannot accelerate faster than 3m/s 2 (x i 3). <p> Regions 3 and 4 use affine feedback. Region 1 uses a nonlinear time-varying feedback. Controllers in Regions 1 and 4 are designed for passenger comfort, whereas the controller in Region 3 employs severe braking to avoid colliding with the preceding vehicle. Refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for more details. For a large number of initial conditions, the dependence of ^z 3 (the minimum spacing) on the initial conditions appears to be monotone. For example, the graph of minimum spacing is a monotone increasing function of initial spacing. However, this is not always the case. <p> Fig. 4. Trajectories in the e-v plane 3 Extended Hybrid Automaton The switched mode controller presented in <ref> [1] </ref> has four discrete states corresponding to different modes of operation, with complicated boundaries and dynamics. By extending the number of states, we can describe a new hybrid automaton with simple dynamics in each state.

Reference-contexts: Finally, all of this analysis has assumed that the car cutting in maintains constant velocity. We need to check that the safe regions are in fact safe for all possible acceleration profiles. It is suggested in <ref> [2] </ref> that the worst case scenario is most likely the situation where the car in front cuts in and then applies maximum braking.

Reference-contexts: The switching is necessary to ensure passenger comfort and stability of the system. The system can be modeled as a hybrid automaton|a continuous time, continuous variable system with phased operation. This hybrid automaton model has been introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. In our lane change scenario, a vehicle from an adjacent lane cuts into the given car's safety distance, throwing it out of normal operation. Such a lane change can be dangerous if the vehicle cuts in too close ahead moving at a slower speed.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the exit time will vary depending on the initial conditions, and the matrix e At will not be constant (an example is found in <ref> [6] </ref>). However, if we consider only flows evolving on one side of the line, it is true that for a planar linear system, the monotonicity condition will be satisfied. If we do not have monotonicity, then there must be some point at which two trajectories cross. <p> The final modification was to make the boundary parallel to the flow lines in one region. For the modified step with boundary at e = 25, we get a curve which is qualitatively the same as the original curve. (See <ref> [6] </ref> for the graph.) The cusps still correspond to trajectories starting on a boundary or passing through a corner of a boundary. However, now the middle segment is monotone decreasing, while in the original case, it was not monotone at all.
