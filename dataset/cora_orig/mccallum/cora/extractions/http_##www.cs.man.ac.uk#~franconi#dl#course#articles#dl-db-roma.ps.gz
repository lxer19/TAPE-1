Reference-contexts: They are often used only in a restricted form, where the minimum cardinality is either 0 or 1 and the maximum cardinality is either 1 or 1. Cardinality constraints in the form considered here have been introduced already in <ref> [Abr74] </ref> and subsequently studied in [GM84; LN90; Fer91; YPS94; Tha92; CL94b; CL94a]. Additionally, so called is-a relations are used to represent inclusion assertions between entities, and therefore the inheritance of properties from a more general entity to a more specific one.

Reference-contexts: One significant aspect of this work is the identification of reasoning problems, where one can take advantage of techniques for reasoning on hierarchical structures that have been developed in different areas. The relationship between frame-based languages and types has been addressed in [BHR90; LNS91; Bor92], while in <ref> [BS92; PSS92; Bor95; ACS96] </ref> frame-based languages are used to enrich the deductive capabilities of data models.

Reference-contexts: However, this strongly limits the expressive power of the data model, as pointed out in recent papers (see e.g. <ref> [AGO91] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: There is also significant work on reasoning about dependencies in the relational model (see 30 LOGICS FOR DATABASES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS e.g. <ref> [CFP84; CK86; GM85; CKV90; AHV95] </ref>), although it has no tight relationship to the framework addressed here. With respect to reasoning on Entity-Relationship schemata, previous work [CTF88; LN90] addressed less expressive formalisms, and therefore the reasoning techniques for Description Logics can provide extensions towards a a significantly more expressive framework.

Reference-contexts: We show that these features make ALCQI powerful enough to provide a unified framework for object-oriented languages and semantic data models. This is done by establishing a precise correspondence with the Entity Relationship model [Che76], and with an object-oriented language in the style of <ref> [AK89] </ref>. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 4 LOGICS FOR DATABASES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS formalism proposed in this paper provides important features that are currently missing in each family, although their relevance has often been stressed. <p> we do not refer DESCRIPTION LOGICS FOR CONCEPTUAL DATA MODELING 17 Class Teacher type-is Union Professor, GradStudent End Class GradStudent is-a Student type-is Record degree: String End Class Course type-is Record enrolls: Set-of Student, taughtby: Teacher End to any specific formalism, our model is inspired by the one presented in <ref> [AK89] </ref>, where a formal characterization is presented, but embodies the basic features of the static part of the ODMG standard [CB97]. <p> Thus we are using an open semantics for records, which is typical of object-oriented data models (see e.g. <ref> [AK89] </ref>). In order to characterize object-oriented data models we define which instances are admissible for a schema. <p> Moreover, type consistency, i.e. checking whether a type is consistent in a legal instance of the schema, can be reduced to concept consistency. A number of attempts have been previously made to characterize reasoning problems and devise reasoning techniques for semantic [CFP84; LN90; DL93; HK87] and object-oriented data models <ref> [AK89; BS92; BN94] </ref>. There is also significant work on reasoning about dependencies in the relational model (see 30 LOGICS FOR DATABASES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS e.g. [CFP84; CK86; GM85; CKV90; AHV95]), although it has no tight relationship to the framework addressed here.

Reference-contexts: Assumption (2) is seldom made in existing concept-based knowledge representation systems, since terminological cycles increase the computational complexity of reasoning <ref> [Baa96] </ref>, and can be interpreted under different semantics [Neb91; Sch94; DGL94]. From a data modeling perspective it is however unrealistic to assume the absence of cycles. DESCRIPTION LOGICS FOR CONCEPTUAL DATA MODELING 7 The semantics of a knowledge base is specified through the notion of satisfaction of assertions.

Reference-contexts: The ER model was introduced in [Che76], and subsequently several variants and extensions have been proposed, which 8 LOGICS FOR DATABASES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS differ in minor aspects in expressiveness and in notation <ref> [Teo89; BCN92; Tha92; Tha93] </ref>. In the ER model the domain of interest is modeled by means of an ER schema, usually represented in a graphical notation which is particularly useful for an easy visualization of the data dependencies. <p> The only direct relationship between entities that can be expressed in the basic ER model is the is-a relation. A common extension is by so called generalization hierarchies (see e.g. <ref> [BCN92] </ref>), which allow one to express that the extension of an entity should be the disjoint union of the extensions of other entities. Such construct can easily be translated by making use of union and negation of Description Logics.

Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-94), </booktitle> <pages> pages 199-204, </pages> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: Observe, however, that views are usually not considered to be part of the schema, but are built on top of it in order to define how the data present in the schema is used <ref> [BDNS94] </ref> (see [CDGL95] for a different "view" on this aspect). We pose no restrictions at all on the form of the assertions in a knowledge base. In particular: 1. Each atomic concept may appear more than once on the left side of an assertion. 2.
