Title: Executing Motion Plans for Robots with Many Degrees of Freedom in Dynamic Environments

Abstract: In many robotic applications motions must be executed robustly in dynamic and partially unknown environments. Despite this requirement most motion planning algorithms assume the environment to be known and changes to be predictable. The planning problem in dynamic environments can be decomposed into a planning and an execution phase. In this paper we describe a new framework for the execution of motion plans for robots with many degrees of freedom in dynamic environments. An initial valid trajectory is incrementally modified according to changes in the environment to maintain a collision free path. This framework achieves real-time performance for robots with many degrees of freedom. It is particularly well suited for redundant systems and mobile manipulation, since it allows motion specification of a subset of the degrees of freedom of the robot, greatly simplifying the task of robot programming.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Most of the motion planning algorithms for robots are based on the assumption that changes in the environment during planning and execution are known a priori <ref> [8] </ref>. However, most applications in robotics require robots to operate in environments that change unpredictably. To allow the execution of motion plans in dynamic environments the global planning process can be augmented with a fast, reactive obstacle avoidance component.

Reference-contexts: With only one distance computation in the workspace a hypersphere of free configuration space can be computed. This hypersphere is called bubble <ref> [11] </ref>. By covering the entire elastic band with overlapping bubbles we can guarantee that the path it represents is collision-free. This is illustrated in Figure 1.

We assume that a collision-free path for a planning problem has been obtained using an arbitrary planning method. <p> For the sake of simplicity we assume in the remainder of this paper that the volume of a rigid body is described by a single spine. 2.3 Representing Local Free Space Bubbles as an efficiently computable representation of local free space were introduced in <ref> [12] </ref>. A bubble captures a spherical region of free space around a given point p. Let d (p) be the function that computes the minimum distance from a point p to any obstacle.

With this augmentation, an initial motion plan can be generated under the assumption that all obstacles are known <ref> [13] </ref>.
