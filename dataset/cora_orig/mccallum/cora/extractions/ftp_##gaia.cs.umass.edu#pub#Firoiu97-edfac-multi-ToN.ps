Abstract: In this paper we present algorithms for flow admission control at an EDF link scheduler when the flows are characterized by piecewise linear traffic envelopes. We show that the algorithms have very low computational complexity and thus, practical applicability. The complexity can be further decreased by introducing the notion of discrete admission control. Through discretization, the range of positions for the end points of linear segments of the traffic envelopes is restricted to a finite set. In simulation experiments, we obtain two orders of magnitude decrease in the amount of computation needed to make admission control decisions over the case of exact (non-discrete) admission control, with the additional benefit that this amount of computation no longer depends on the number of flows. We examine the relative performance degradation (in terms of the number of flows admitted) incurred by the discretization and find the tradeoff to be small.

Reference-contexts: Several flow setup protocols that convey end-to- end user delay requirements to the links have been proposed and are in the process of standardization; these include RSVP [2] for the Internet, and ATM signaling <ref> [1] </ref> for ATM networks. The problem of providing delay guarantees at a network link is the focus of much current research. Much of this work focuses on the issue of packet scheduling determining the order in which queued packets are forwarded over outgoing links at switches and routers. <p> Our proposed flow admission control algorithms are compatible with the emerging standards for flow setup protocols specified by the Internet Integrated Services [18] and the ATM signaling <ref> [1] </ref>. We find that our algorithms have low complexity O (KN ) where N is the num <p>- 2 ber of admitted flows at the EDF scheduler at the moment of the algorithm's invocation and K is the number of segments in a flow's envelope. <p> Consider a source that wishes to establish a flow f to a destination, using ATM Signaling. It sends a SETUP message to the destination, which includes information such as the flow's traffic characteristics (maximum cell rate, sustained cell rate, maximum burst size <ref> [1] </ref>), and the maximum allowable end-to-end delay, d f . <p> To account for possible varia-tions in bandwidths associated with different encodings (MPEG-1, H.261, H.263, RealVideo and Vxtreme), the (; ) characterizations from Table 1 are scaled with a random parameter that takes values in <ref> [0:01; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Multiple-segment envelopes are easy to specify: each segment is characterized by a (rate, burst size) pair. Multiple-segment envelopes are also easy to regulate and police (see e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). A multiple-segment regulator is constructed with a set of leaky bucket regulators in series. It has also been shown in [20] that this tandem of regulators does not introduce any additional worst case delay for the regulated flow. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we characterize flows by multiple-segment envelopes that bound the amount of generated traffic over an interval of length t. The motivation for this general characterization is that recent studies (for example <ref> [12] </ref>) have shown that, in order to achieve high link utilization, flows must be characterized by piecewise linear functions having more than two segments. This study has shown that moderately bursty traffic (e.g., some movies) achieve high link utilization (90% of maximum) when using envelopes with 3-4 segments.

First, the implementation of EDF scheduling requires a search of O (logQ) time in the list of packets (ordered by their deadlines) waiting in the queue of length Q for transmission. This issue has been addressed in <ref> [19, 13] </ref>, where the search time is reduced to constant (O (1)) time by discretizing the range of packet deadline values. The second issue is that, although the EDF schedulability conditions in [13] can be expressed simply, the algorithms to perform these schedulability tests can be computationally very complex. <p> This issue has been addressed in [19, 13], where the search time is reduced to constant (O (1)) time by discretizing the range of packet deadline values.

In order to provide better intuition, in this paper we measure the traffic as a number of data units (bits) rather than transmission time (seconds), as in <ref> [13] </ref>. Let us consider a set of N flows, where flow i is characterized by its envelope A fl i . The stability condition for a work-conserving scheduler (including the EDF scheduler) is ([13], eq. (5)): lim P N i (t) &lt; 1 (1) where c is the constant rate of <p> condition for a work-conserving scheduler (including the EDF scheduler) is (<ref> [13] </ref>, eq.

In the case of a preemptive EDF scheduler we state the following variant of the schedulability condition proposed in [13] for the set of N flows: 4 Theorem 1 (Liebeherr, Wrege, Ferrari) Consider a set of N flows, that satisfy (1), where flow i is char- <br>- acterized by its envelope A fl i and has a maximum packet delay requirement at a given link of d i . <p> There are two conditions required for a set of envelopes (A fl i ; d i ) 1iN to be schedulable at an NPEDF scheduler with capacity c, <ref> [13] </ref>. The stability condition lim t!1 P N i (t)=ct &lt; 1 is identical to the stability condition of the corresponding PEDF scheduler. <p> We applied the admission control conditions put forward by <ref> [13] </ref> to flows characterized by multiple- segment envelopes. We developed a first set of algorithms with a computation complexity of O (KN ), where N is the number of flows admitted in the EDF scheduler at the time of algorithm invocation and K is the number of segments per envelope.
