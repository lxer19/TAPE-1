Abstract: We establish significantly improved bounds on the performance of the greedy algorithm for approximating minimum set cover and minimum partial cover. Our improvements result from a new approach to both problems. In particular, (a) we improve the known bound on the performance ratio of the greedy algorithm for general covers without cost, showing that it differs from the classical harmonic bound by a function which approaches infinity (as the size of the base set increases); (b) we show that, for covers without cost, the performance guarantee for the greedy algorithm is significantly better than the performance guarantee for the randomized rounding algorithm; (c) we prove that the classical bounds on the performance of the greedy algorithm for complete covers with costs are valid for partial covers as well, thus lowering, by more than a factor of two, the previously known estimate.

Reference-contexts: These problems are NP-hard (see [6] or [3]), hence efficient approximation algorithms are of great interest. One of the best known algorithms for approximating the minimum set cover is the so called greedy algorithm. The classical bound on its performance ratio (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>, [5], or [8]) is c greedy c min where c greedy and c min are the costs of a minimum subcover and the subcover output by the greedy algorithm, respectively, d bounds the size of the sets in the cover, and H (d) = 1 + + 1=d.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the minimum set cover problem, the goal is to find a smallest subcover of a cover of a finite "base set". This can be generalized for covers with costs, where the goal is to find a subcover with minimum cost. These problems are NP-hard (see [6] or <ref> [3] </ref>), hence efficient approximation algorithms are of great interest. One of the best known algorithms for approximating the minimum set cover is the so called greedy algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Even though this algorithm (see Preliminaries) is a straightforward modification of the greedy algorithm for complete covers, its output is less predictable, hence the approach used by Chvatal, Johnson, or Lovasz for proving (1) and (2) cannot be generalized. In <ref> [7, p. 69] </ref>, Kearns proves that for 0 &lt; p 1 c greedy c min This is much worse than the bounds for minimum set cover and only shows how complicated the behavior of the "greedy" partial cover can be. <p> Question: What is the minimum cost of a p-cover J fl of U ? 3 Greedy Algorithm We will use a minor modification of the greedy algorithm for minimum partial cover given by Kearns in <ref> [7] </ref>. Step 1. Set J fl = ;. Step 2. Set r = pm j S j2J fl S j j, i.e. r is the number of elements of U yet to be covered in order to obtain a p-cover. Step 3.

Reference-contexts: These results clearly contain, as a special case, the bounds proved by Chvatal and Johnson, and significantly improve Kearns's estimate. Section 3 is devoted to general covers with equal costs, i.e. c 1 = c 2 = = c n . Lund and Yan-nakakis in <ref> [9] </ref> proved that even in this special case, assuming DT IM E [n ln O (1) n ] 6= N T IM E [n ln O (1) n ], no polynomial time algorithm can approximate minimum set cover to a performance ratio of better than c log 2 m, for any

Reference-contexts: Recently, other algorithms for approximating the minimum set cover were introduced, among them the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson ([11]). In the case of covers with constant costs, Srinivasan in <ref> [12] </ref> showed that the approximation guarantee for the randomized rounding algorithm is c rra c fl m min m min ! making it appear at that point that the performance ratio for the randomized rounding technique was better than the performance ratio for the greedy algorithm.
