Abstract: Term logic is characterized by subject-predicate statements and syllogistic inference rules. This kind of logic, when properly extended, provides a natural and consistent model for multiple types of inference, including deduction, abduction, induction and revision. This paper briefly describes how such a logic works in the NARS project.

Reference-contexts: Term logic uses syllogistic inference rules, in each of which two statements sharing a common term generate a new statement linking the two unshared terms. When Aristotle introduced the deduction/induction distinction, he presented it in term logic, and so did Peirce when he added abduction into the picture <ref> [ Peirce, 1931 ] </ref> .
