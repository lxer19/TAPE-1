Reference-contexts: No particular protocol need be required, so media agents can select the protocol best suited to their needs. Discussion is underway to create a specification for a connection control protocol that could interoperate with other conference manager implementations <ref> [1, 18, 19, 29] </ref>. The architecture also needs to support an interface for groupware tool builders.

Reference-contexts: However, an appropriate timeout length is difficult to predict over such a varied and dynamic community of networks as the Internet.

Timeout choice is further complicated by the fact that there are other delays that figure into the complete timeout computation.

Reference-contexts: Toward this end, we have developed both a suite of experimental packet protocols [28, 6, 7] to provide performance guarantees for real-time data, and an underlying network, the Terrestrial Wideband Network (TWBnet) as an experimental testbed <ref> [3] </ref>. More recently, we have also begun using the DARPA Research Testbed (DARTnet) as a means for testing these protocols. As proof of concept, a real-time, multimedia conferencing system has been implemented that couples real-time packet-switched voice and video with a shared workspace, allowing geographically separated individuals to collaborate [23].

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, MMCC does support some degree of asynchrony by allowing certain local activities to occur while a site is waiting for a reply to its request. Because of the transaction-oriented nature of MMCC's activities, there was initial consideration of VMTP <ref> [4, 5] </ref> or Sun RPC [24, 25] as the underlying protocols to use between MMCCs.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the other two servers allow bidirectional communication between the servers and the devices, so errors may be reported locally and/or remotely. 6. Integration with Groupware MMCC interacts with the BBN MMConf program <ref> [8] </ref> to support a suite of shared applications, ranging from shared documents, to shared presentation tools, to shared video map browsers, et cetera. MMCC can automatically establish and disconnect an MMConf session in parallel with voice and video connections, bringing up MMConf in a designated conference directory.

Reference-contexts: Instead of waiting for a reply from one peer before moving on to the next, MMCC would initiate all requests simultaneously. The control protocol will need to experiment with efficient ways to handle the added asynchrony. Furthermore, use of IP multicast <ref> [9] </ref> may be in order as well. Resynchronization. The present approach is admittedly quite passive. MMCC does not set out to locate mismatched states among peers.

Reference-contexts: MMCC can automatically establish and disconnect an MMConf session in parallel with voice and video connections, bringing up MMConf in a designated conference directory. In addition, MMCC interacts with Mbftptool, a window-based application to run multiple background FTPs among conference participants <ref> [10] </ref>. Mbftptool may be used both before and during conferences to prestage transfers of files intended to be shared. -8 MMCC uses a conference identifier to loosely couple with these conferencing tools.

Making voice and video standard data types promises to challenge the way we design applications and our expectations from them. Current support for real-time data at all levels in the system is embryonic at best.

Reference-contexts: future direction is to explore a more unified model for these services, in other words, to establish well-defined interfaces between the media agents and the servers to allow separate but similar devices (e.g., different video codecs) to substitute for one another (e.g., when the requested service was busy or unavailable) <ref> [19] </ref>, in the same way agents might substitute for one another. This task includes the creation of a description language to characterize the capabilities of devices and available resources. This language would be used by media agents to choose among underlying options. <p> No particular protocol need be required, so media agents can select the protocol best suited to their needs.

Reference-contexts: The control protocol's prime tasks are conference establishment, which includes coordinating resource selection across sites (since we support multiple video codecs), and disconnection. The protocol supports auxiliary tasks as well, such as allowing remote cameras to be switched on request. The CCP uses UDP <ref> [20] </ref> to communicate control information between its peers. Since n-way communication is required among conferees, UDP was favored over TCP [21].

The CCP uses UDP [20] to communicate control information between its peers. Since n-way communication is required among conferees, UDP was favored over TCP <ref> [21] </ref>. Each site only needs one UDP socket [26] to which all other sites can connect, whereas the comparable TCP implementation would require n sockets per site, or n squared sockets total. Furthermore, UDP's connectionless service is ideal for MMCC operation.

Reference-contexts: This section coalesces some themes for an improved conference control architecture. 10.1 Personal Conferencing: Inter-office telecollaboration To complement formal meeting facilities, MMCC needs to support highly informal, impromptu conferences where individuals rendezvous as desired <ref> [22] </ref>. Therefore, the project is moving away from inter-meeting-room conferences and toward personal conferencing in the form of inter-office collaborations. Although office-to-office conferencing may arise on a more frequent basis, there is still a place for meeting room conferences, for example when many people need to conference simultaneously.

As proof of concept, a real-time, multimedia conferencing system has been implemented that couples real-time packet-switched voice and video with a shared workspace, allowing geographically separated individuals to collaborate <ref> [23] </ref>. Teleconferencing sites are currently located near Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Rome, New York, as well as in London, England. MMCC, the multimedia conference control program, serves as the application interface to the teleconferencing system.

Reference-contexts: Among other things, the conference manager would avoid duplication of effort in conference-oriented applications; this encompasses management of participation (state information, conferee lists), authentication (passwords), and presentation of coordinated user interfaces. This is along the lines of Swinehart's switching kernel <ref> [27] </ref> and in some regards is related to Lantz' and Lauwers' models for user interfaces that endow programs with the smarts to be multi-user [16]. This idea is discussed further in the section Future Directions. 7. User Interface MMCC usually appears in a corner of the computer screen. <p> This capability has not been addressed in our system. In addition, ideas such as call forwarding and visiting, which have been successful in LAN settings <ref> [27] </ref>, need to be explored as useful tools in wider area environments. 10.2 Conference Manager Abstraction Perhaps the most important conclusions drawn from our experience with conference control are the need for a conference manager abstraction, and the need to provide well-defined interfaces between system components.

Reference: [30] <institution> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), </institution> <note> RFC 1098. -18 </note>
Reference-contexts: HCP may be used between MMCC and PVP to select among and to organize the display of the video streams. As we move to new implementations of the real-time programs for the SPARCstation platform, we plan to communicate with each module independently via HCP, or possibly SNMP <ref> [30] </ref> or RPC. This eliminates the need for shared memory between VT and PVP. This also means the details of connection failures will no longer be ambiguous, that the system will have a more complete monitoring capability, and that separate audio or video-only conferences could be established.
