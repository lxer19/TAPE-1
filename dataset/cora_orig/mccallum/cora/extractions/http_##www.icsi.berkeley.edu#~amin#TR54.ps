Abstract: Elementary Proofs of some Results on Representations of p-groups Abstract A result of Roquette [3] states that if D is an absolutely irreducible representation of a p-group G over the field of complex numbers, then D can be realized in K((g) j g 2 G), where is the character of D and K = Q or K = Q(i) according to whether p 6= 2 or p = 2. Based on Baum and Clausen's [1] algorithm for computing the irreducible representations of supersolvable groups, we give an elementary proof of a theorem which, among other well-known facts on representations of p-groups, implies Roquette's result.

Reference-contexts: The elementary proof of the main theorem is based on an algorithm of Baum and Clausen <ref> [1] </ref> for the construction of the irreducible representations of supersolvable groups. This proof is elementary in the sense that it only uses some basic knowledge about the representation theory of finite groups, as well as some simple results on cyclotomic fields. <p> The proof is based on the approach of Baum and Clausen <ref> [1] </ref> to compute irreducible representations of supersolvable groups. Note first that part (5) of the theorem is a consequence of parts (1) and (4) by Lemma 5 (1). So we are left with the proof of parts (1)-(4). For this we use induction on i.

Reference-contexts: An arbitrary representation of an arbitrary group G may not be realizable over its character field. If G is a p-group, however, it was proved by Roquette <ref> [3] </ref> that any irreducible representation of G with character is realizable over K () where K = Q if G has odd order and K = Q (i) otherwise. <p> In case p 6= 2 this field is equal to Q if and only if F is the trivial representation. This theorem implies the following well-known results. Corollary 7. (Roquette <ref> [3] </ref>) An absolutely irreducible representation F of G with character is always realizable over K (). Proof.

Reference-contexts: There exists T 2 GL (n; L) such that S = T 1 T if and only if N (S) = I n . An easy alternative proof of this theorem can be found in Serre's book <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 1.4 Cyclotomic Fields For an integer n let L n denote the cyclotomic field generated over Q by a primitive nth root of unity. For instance, L 2 = Q, and L 4 = Q (i).

Reference-contexts: Note however that if n &gt; 1, then the norm of S does not even need to belong to M nfin . The following theorem, due to Speiser <ref> [5] </ref>, is a generalization of Hilbert's Theorem 90. Theorem 4. Assume that L=M has a cyclic Galois group generated by and let S 2 GL (n; L).
