Title: Determining Projections and Functionals for Weak Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equations  
Author: M. J. Holst and E. S. Titi

Note: Contemporary Mathematics Volume  
Abstract: In this paper we prove that an operator which projects weak solutions of the two- or three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations onto a finite- dimensional space is determining if it annihilates the difference of two "nearby" weak solutions asymptotically, and if it satisfies a single appoximation inequality. We then apply this result to show that the long-time behavior of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, in both two- and three-dimensions, is determined by the long-time behavior of a finite set of bounded linear function- als. These functionals are constructed by local surface averages of solutions over certain simplex volume elements, and are therefore well-defined for weak solutions. Moreover, these functionals define a projection operator which satisfies the necessary approximation inequality for our theory. We use the general theory to establish lower bounds on the simplex diameters in both two- and three-dimensions. Furthermore, in the three dimensional case we make a connection between their diameters and the Kolmogoroff dissipation small scale in turbulent flows.

Reference-contexts: Let R d denote an open bounded set. The imbedding results we will need are known to hold for example if the domain has a locally Lipschitz boundary, denoted as 2 C 0;1 (cf. <ref> [Ada78] </ref>). For example, open bounded convex sets R d satisfy 2 C 0;1 (Corollary 1.2.2.3 in [Gri85]), so that convex polyhedral domains (which we consider here) are in C 0;1 . Let H k () denote the usual Sobolev spaces W k;2 (). <p> This will be true if the function u is continuous in , hence uniformly continuous on . One of the Sobolev imbedding results (cf. <ref> [Ada78] </ref>) states that if R d satisfies 2 C 0;1 , then for nonnegative real numbers k and s it holds that H k () ,!

Reference-contexts: We extend these results to three dimensions in x5, by requiring (following <ref> [CDTi95] </ref>) that weak solutions satisfy an additional technical assumption (due to the lack of appropriate global a priori estimates), which is related to the natural notion of mean dissipation rate of energy. 4 M. J. HOLST AND E. S. TITI 2. <p> The Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes Equations The lack of appropriate a priori estimates in the three-dimensional case requires a modification of the approach taken for the two-dimensional case in the previous section. However, the interpolation results we have employed are dimension- independent, and by following the analysis approach of <ref> [CDTi95] </ref> very closely, we can obtain similar results for the three-dimensional case. Again we require only that f 2 V 0 , but we also assume the existence of a unique weak solution to the 10 M. J. HOLST AND E. S. TITI three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.

HOLST AND E. S. TITI The generalized interpolant due to Scott and Zhang <ref> [SZ90] </ref> can be defined for H 1 -functions in both two and three spatial dimensions. The SZ-interpolant I h is constructed from a combination linear interpolation and local averaging on faces and edges of simplices, and has optimal approximation properties even in the case of H 1 -functions. Lemma 3.1. <p> Lemma 3.1. For the SZ-interpolant of u 2 H 1+ff 0 (), ff 0, it holds that ku I h uk L 2 () C 1 h 1+ff juj H 1+ff () : Proof. See the appendix for a condensed proof following <ref> [BS94, SZ90] </ref>. <p> The corollary then follows by application of Theorem 5.1. Appendix: Approximability of the Scott-Zhang Interpolant We will sketch the proof of the approximability result for the SZ-interpolant given as Lemma 3.1; we will follow quite closely the proof given in <ref> [BS94, SZ90] </ref>. As throughout this paper, we assume that 2 C 0;1 , and that the given exact simplicial triangulation of is both shape-regular and quasi-uniform. The proof of Lemma 3.1 will follow easily from the following result (see the comments at the end of this appendix). Lemma 5.1. <p> Almost by construction, one can show <ref> [SZ90] </ref> that * I h : H 1 () 7! V h () is a projection * I h : H 1 where V 0h is the subset of V h having zero trace on the boundary of . Thus, I h preserves homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. <p> Thus, I h preserves homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using homogeneity arguments, the following stability result for the interpolant is established in <ref> [SZ90] </ref>. Lemma 5.2. <p> See the proof of Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [SZ90] </ref>. DETERMINING PROJECTIONS AND FUNCTIONALS FOR NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS13 The proof of the Scott and Zhang [SZ90] approximation result is as follows. <p> See the proof of Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [SZ90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The parameter h will be referred to as the characteristic parameter, or characteristic length scale, of such a quasi-uniform shape-regular mesh. It should be noted that given some initial triangulation satisfying (3.1), repeated bi-section [Ban91] or octa-section <ref> [Zha88] </ref> (quadra-section in 2D) of each simplex can be performed in such a way as to guarantee non-degeneracy asymptotically, in that the quasi-uniformity and shape-regularity are preserved.
