Reference-contexts: Third, if and are close together, then we cannot make a decision based only on and . The third condition is what we call the grey zone. In order to determine if we are in the grey zone, we use hypothesis testing. According to <ref> [Cho69] </ref>, hypothesis testing consist of six steps: hypotheses formulation, level of significance determination, testing statistic derivation, decision rule formulation, computation, and decision. First, we must formulate our hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: In statistical sampling, a small piece of the relation is selected at random, and the query is applied to it. By either taking several small samples [LNS90, LN89] or one sufficiently large sample <ref> [HOT88, PSC84] </ref>, estimations about the size of the results can be derived. However, in order to get good results, sampling can require more time than the actual query itself [LNS90], thus eliminating its usefulness.

Reference-contexts: This provides query optimization without transmission of database statistics. The standard method for estimating the number of tuples which will satisfy a query is to have the database keep statistics about values in the database (see e.g. <ref> [KS91, OV91] </ref>). Although this approach is very effective in centralized databases, it does suffer from several well known drawbacks. First, there is overhead involved in keeping the statistics current. If the statistics are out of date, the query optimization could be incorrect.

In heterogeneous distributed database systems, there may not be any statistical information available about data at a remote site. Likewise, it could be very expensive to transmit data in this environment, both in terms of time and money.
