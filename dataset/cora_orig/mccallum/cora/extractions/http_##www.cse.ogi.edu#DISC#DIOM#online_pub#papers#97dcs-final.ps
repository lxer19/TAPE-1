Abstract: The rapid growth of the wide-area network technology has led to an increasing number of information sources available on-line. To ensure the query services to scale up with such dynamic open environments, an advanced distributed information system must provide adequate support for dynamic interconnection between information consumers and information producers, instead of just functioning as a static data delivery system. We develop a distributed query scheduling framework to demonstrate the feasibility and the benefit for supporting interoperability and dynamic information gathering across heterogeneous information sources, without relying on an integrated view pre-defined over the participating information sources. We outline the mechanisms developed for the main components of our distributed query scheduling framework, such as query routing and query execution planning services. We also provide a concrete example to illustrate the issues on how the information consumers' query requests are dynamically processed and linked to the heterogeneous information sources and how the query scheduling framework scales up as the number of information sources increases.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we first replace the interface ClaimFolder by an aggregation-based join, namely D-AggregationJoin, over the three interfaces Claim, Image, and DiagnosisRep. An aggregation-based join refers to an object join which maintains the nested aggregation structure while traversing through the objects following the aggregation path <ref> [8] </ref>. Then we replace each generalization interface by the corresponding base interfaces. In our example, Claims is replaced by S4:Claim, Insur-Agreement is replaced by S4:Agreements, Image is replaced by S3:Images, and DiagnosisRep is replaced by S5:DiagReport.

Reference-contexts: We have proposed the Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM) <ref> [10] </ref> in the context of the Diorama project as a concrete mediator-based approach to interoperability through the cooperation among a network of specialized mediators. Our early work mainly focuses on the design of the DIOM object model which captures the requirements of advanced distributed information systems as the USECA properties [10]: <p> <ref> [10] </ref> in the context of the Diorama project as a concrete mediator-based approach to interoperability through the cooperation among a network of specialized mediators. Our early work mainly focuses on the design of the DIOM object model which captures the requirements of advanced distributed information systems as the USECA properties [10]: Uniform access to heterogeneous multimedia information sources, Scalability to the growing number of information sources, Evolution and Compos-ability of software and information sources, and Autonomy of participants, both information consumers and information producers. <p> We also report our initial implementation experience in the Diorama project. Numerous other recent projects have similar goals and are discussed briefly at the end of the paper. 2 System Architecture: An Overview The DIOM system architecture, first introduced in <ref> [10] </ref>, is a two-tier architecture offering services at both mediator level and wrapper level. It conforms to the I 3 intelligent integration of information reference framework [6]. Figure 1 presents a sketch of the DIOM system architecture currently being implemented in the Diorama project. <p> Query interface manager is responsible for (1) recording a form query in terms of the DIOM interface query language (DIOM IQL), a SQL-like language [11], and (2) generating virtual interface classes, described in terms of the DIOM interface definition language (DIOM IDL) <ref> [10] </ref>, which are used as template holders for receiving and representing the resulting objects of the query. <p> If the IDL specification of the target interfaces given in the FROM clause does not exist, an appropriate IDL specification will be generated <ref> [10] </ref>. For instance, assume that there is no interfaces previously generated, and from the user query profile, we know that, to create ClaimFolder objects, we need to link the patients' claims, stored in some relational databases, with the corresponding X-ray images and doctors' diagnosis reports. <p> Thus, the IQL preprocessor will create two compound interfaces, one named ClaimFolder and another named Insur-Agreement, using the DIOM interface composition meta operation <ref> [10] </ref> before passing this query to the distributed query routing module.
