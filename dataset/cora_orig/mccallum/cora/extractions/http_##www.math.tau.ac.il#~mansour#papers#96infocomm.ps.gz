Title: Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Policies  
Author: Y. Afek M. Cohen E. Haalman Y. Mansour 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Tel-Aviv University  
Abstract: When traffic of connectionless best effort protocols such as IP is carried over connection oriented protocols with guaranteed bandwidth, such as CBR connection in ATM, the interface layer between the protocols (i.e., AAL the ATM Adaption Layer) need to specify the bandwidth requirement and the duration of the bandwidth reservation. The purpose of this paper is to develop policies for deciding and for adjusting the amount of bandwidth requested for a best effort connection over such networks. Our aim is to develop such policies that achieve a good trade off between latency and utilization. The performances of the different policies are compared by an empirical evaluation.

Reference-contexts: That is, to carry an IP datagram in such networks a virtual circuit (VC) has to be setup with an indicated bandwidth requirement. This mismatch in characteristics introduces several problems that the adaption layer has to resolve <ref> [SK, LPR] </ref>. For example, once a VC is open, and the datagram has been sent, the adaption layer has to decide how long to keep the VC open with the initial bandwidth. <p> The static and periodic algorithms are presented in Section 3 and the adaptive algorithms in Section 4. Conclusions can be found in Section 5. Theoretical analysis of the periodic algorithms is deferred to the final paper. 1.1 Previous Work Saran and Keshav <ref> [SK] </ref> have introduced and studied the question of virtual circuit holding cost. That is, once a virtual circuit is open for say an IP application, how long should you hold the circuit open while no packets are arriving.

Lund, Phillips and Reinglod <ref> [LPR] </ref> empirically studied the same problem and developed an adaptive scheme, which adapt to the inter-arrival time distributions of each circuit. 2 Currently, ATM networks do not support such an operation. 2 Model and Problem statement The smallest time units that we consider in this paper and have used in our

Reference-contexts: For our experiments we need to predict the number of packets arriving during the next period. In order to do that, we "learn" a state machine that describes best the behavior of the network in the recent past (several previous periods) using the learning algorithm of <ref> [JR] </ref>. (In a nutshell, the algorithm performs an Expectation Maximization (EM). In each iteration, the maximum likelihood partition into states is computed, assuming that the current model that we have is the correct one.
