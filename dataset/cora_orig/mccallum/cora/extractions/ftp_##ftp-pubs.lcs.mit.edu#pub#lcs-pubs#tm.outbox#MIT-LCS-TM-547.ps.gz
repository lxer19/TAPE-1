Reference-contexts: The Viterbi algorithm can also be used as a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) equalizer <ref> [1, 2, 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The final result is composed of twice 189 bits sequences, see Figure 6. Convolutional decoding can be performed using a Viterbi algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. A Viterbi decoder logically explores in parallel every possible user data in sequence. It encodes and compare each one against the received sequence and picks up the closest match: it is a maximum likelihood decoder. <p> The Viterbi algorithm can also be used as a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) equalizer <ref> [1, 2, 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: So, the GSM bit rate per flow is 456 bits each 20 ms i.e. 22.8 kb/s. Note that there is a software Viterbi decoder developed 4 by Phil Karn, from Qual-comm Inc. which supports the (K=7, r=1/2) NASA standard code <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.3 Interleaving / De-interleaving Interleaving is meant to decorrelate the relative positions of the bits respectively in the code words and in the modulated radio bursts. The aim of the interleaving algorithm is to avoid the risk of loosing consecutive data bits.

Reference-contexts: The frequency hopping algorithm is broadcast on the Broadcast Control Channel. Since multipath fading is dependent on carrier frequency, slow frequency hopping help mitigate the problem. Fre 2 This figure is inspired by <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 quency hopping is an option for each individual cell and a base station is not required to support this feature. 3 From Speech to Radio Waves waves to speech.

Reference-contexts: Note that the Phase 2 of GSM defines a new half rate speech encoder (GSM 06.20 RPE-LTP). 3.2 The GSM Channel Coding Channel coding introduces redundancy into the data flow in order to allow the detection or even the correction of bit errors introduced during the transmission <ref> [10] </ref>. The speech coding algorithm produces a speech block of 260 bits every 20 ms (i.e. bit rate 13 kbit/s). In the decoder, these speech blocks are decoded and converted to 13 bit uniformly coded speech samples. The 260 bits of the speech block are classified into two groups.
