Title: An Adversarial Model for Distributed Dynamic Load Balancing  
Author: S. Muthukrishnan Rajmohan Rajaraman 
Date: January 21, 1998  
Abstract: We study the problem of balancing the load on processors of an arbitrary network. If jobs arrive or depart during the process of load balancing, we have the dynamic load balancing problem; otherwise, we have the static load balancing problem. While static load balancing on arbitrary and special networks has been well studied, very little is known about dynamic load balancing. The difficulty lies in modeling the arrivals and departures of jobs in a clean manner. In this paper, we initiate the study of dynamic load balancing by modeling job traffic using an adversary. Our main result is that a simple, local control distributed load balancing algorithm maintains the load of the network within a stable level against this powerful adversary. Our results hold for different models of traffic patterns and processor communication.

The proof of the second claim is symmetric. It is useful to extend the notion of height to tokens as well. For this purpose, we assign, for every node v, a unique rank from <ref> [1; w t (v)] </ref> to each token at v. Let the height of a token be its rank minus a t .

Reference-contexts: We model a distributed system by an arbitrary network (graph) in which the nodes represent the processors and the edges represent the communication links. We assume that the load consists of independent tokens that may be processed anywhere.

Reference-contexts: Such load balancing problems arise in a number of parallel and distributed applications including job scheduling in operating systems (e.g., see [29]), packet routing (e.g., see [23]), parallel finite element methods (e.g., see <ref> [10] </ref>); other applications can be found in [27]. Load balancing problems can be classified into two categories: static and dynamic. In static load balancing, the total workload is available at the start of the computation, and no new load is added to the system. <p> Parallel computations such as large-scale partial diferential equations and finite element methods rely on static load balancing. In these applications, the given computation can be divided into a large number of small computational tasks that are distributed among the processors (for example, see <ref> [10, 29] </ref>). Another important application of static load balancing arises in certain packet routing problems, where the initial distribution of packets may be irregular. <p> Since communication is typically assumed to be in handshaking mode, this implies that at any step, tokens may only move along a set of edges that form a graph matching.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An important problem in a distributed system is to balance the total workload among the various processors of the underlying system. Such load balancing problems arise in a number of parallel and distributed applications including job scheduling in operating systems (e.g., see [29]), packet routing (e.g., see <ref> [23] </ref>), parallel finite element methods (e.g., see [10]); other applications can be found in [27]. Load balancing problems can be classified into two categories: static and dynamic. <p> Another important application of static load balancing arises in certain packet routing problems, where the initial distribution of packets may be irregular. Routing is performed by first redistributing the packets among the processors in a balanced manner, and then invoking standard routing techniques such as permutation routing or k-k-routing <ref> [23] </ref>. Much of the extensive literature on distributed load balancing in fact study static load balancing. In dynamic load balancing, the load is dynamic, that is, the total workload may vary with fl Information Sciences Center, Bell Labs.

The local algorithm we described above was proposed in this context [3], and it is known to take asymptotically optimal number of steps to balance the load [13]. <p> The network load is modeled by tokens, each of which may be processed at any node of the network. In order to balance the load distribution, tokens may be communicated among different nodes. We adopt the standard synchronous multi-port model for this communication <ref> [3, 13, 21, 24] </ref>: in each step, each node can send or receive at most one token along each of its incident links. In order to study the dynamic aspect of load balancing, we introduce an adversarial model.

Reference-contexts: Their results are not applicable in our model, however, because their model places no bound on the amount of information or load that can be sent along any edge at any time. In addition, their work involves certain non-local operations that are inefficient in our model. (See <ref> [4, 12, 25] </ref> for more work on this problem.)

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An important problem in a distributed system is to balance the total workload among the various processors of the underlying system. Such load balancing problems arise in a number of parallel and distributed applications including job scheduling in operating systems (e.g., see <ref> [29] </ref>), packet routing (e.g., see [23]), parallel finite element methods (e.g., see [10]); other applications can be found in [27]. Load balancing problems can be classified into two categories: static and dynamic. <p> Parallel computations such as large-scale partial diferential equations and finite element methods rely on static load balancing. In these applications, the given computation can be divided into a large number of small computational tasks that are distributed among the processors (for example, see <ref> [10, 29] </ref>). Another important application of static load balancing arises in certain packet routing problems, where the initial distribution of packets may be irregular. <p> CCR-9504145. 1 time 1 . Dynamic load balancing is required in a wide variety of applications, including operating systems [11, 19], combinatorial optimization problems [18], and adaptive mesh partitioning <ref> [15, 29] </ref>. The results and techniques of static load balancing are applicable for certain problems in which the computation can be divided into alternating phases of balancing and processing. For most applications, however, it is desired to have a continuous process that manages the distribution of load among nodes. <p> Similarly, in many parallel mesh computations, the mesh regions are continuously refined, or coarsened, thereby modifying the number of mesh points (and hence the load) in different mesh regions (for a more elaborate description, see <ref> [29] </ref>). Due to the potentially arbitrary nature of the on-line load arrival and departure process, dynamic load balancing is substantially more challenging than the static version.
