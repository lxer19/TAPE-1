Abstract: Wrappers export the schema and data of existing heterogeneous databases and support queries on them. In the context of cooperative information systems, we present a flexible approach to specify the derivation of object-oriented export databases from local relational databases. Our export database derivation consists of a set of extent derivation structures which defines the extent and deep extent of export classes. Having well-defined semantics, the extent derivation structures can be readily used in transforming wrapper queries to local queries. Based on the extent derivation structures, we developed a wrapper query evaluation strategy which handles object-oriented queries on the export databases. The strategy further considers the limited query processing capabilities of local database systems and the language constraints on the local query languages.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the traditional view definition, the export DBs may be designed with an intention to ease the resolution of inter-database schema- or instance-level conflicts. An export DB may contain or incorporate extra semantics that are not found in the local DB <ref> [4] </ref>. * Encapsulating the data model and query language differences among local database fl The author is now with the Port of Singapore Authority. systems: Apart from exporting local DBs, wrappers have to process queries on the export DBs. Queries on the export DBs are also known as wrapper queries. <p> For example, a SQL statement may not support selection or projection over a union of tables. Related Work In <ref> [4] </ref>, the concept of metaclass has been introduced to integrate relational DBs into a federated DB system based on an OO data model known as VO-DAK. This approach requires methods to be defined to extract the attributes of relations into the VODAK data model as properties of export classes. <p> In our OO query model, we allow queries to be directed at both the extents and deep extents of classes. E fl EDSs are declarative in nature. Unlike other previously proposed derivation languages <ref> [7, 4] </ref>, the class derivation structures are expressible in a graphical form. It is therefore easy to adopt extent derivation structures in a graphical tool for specifying export database derivation.

This can be further improved if the cost model of the exist ing DBMS is made available or can be calibrated.

There is a subtle difference between this problem and designing OO query interface to existing relational DBs.
