Abstract: We describe how to teach deformable models to recognize segmentation correctness based on user-specified criteria, and we present a method for evaluating which criteria work best. We present sectored snakes, a formulation that demonstrably improves upon regular snakes. A traditional deformable model (snake in 2D), used for image segmentation, fails to find an object's boundary when the strongest nearby image edges are not the ones sought. But models can be trained to respond to other image features instead, by building their probability distribution. The implementor must then decide on which of many image qualities to teach the model. To this end, we show how to evaluate the efficacy of any resulting deformable model, given a sampling of ground truth, a model of the range of shapes tried during optimization, and a measure of shape closeness. In the domain of abdominal CT images, we demonstrate such evaluation on a sectoring of a snake, in which intensity and perpendicular gradient are observed over equal-length segments. This specific set of qualities shows a measured improvement over an objective function that is uniform around the shape, and it follows naturally from examination of the latter's failures due to images variations around the organ boundary.

Reference-contexts: The Hausdorff distance, since it it depends on minima and maxima of distances between points on two contours, is not robust to small protrusions in either shape. The symmetric difference of areas was inefficient to calculate. We chose the chamfer distance between two boundaries <ref> [Borgefors, 1988] </ref>, which is the average over one shape of distance to the closest point on the 19 other. To calculate this, one does a distance transform on an image containing one shape, then averages the distance values intersected by the other.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In [Kass et al., 1987], the authors introduced a flexible shape model that moved until it maximized some combination (energy) of its smoothness and the cumulative strength and proximity of nearby image edges. But there was no right way to set the parameters of this combination <ref> [Boult et al., 1994] </ref>. 1 Furthermore, it was not established how effective an objective function based on those particular quantities was in the first place.

Reference-contexts: It is, however, more robust to this pathology than the Hausdorff distance, and the forward-reverse correlation over our test set shows that it did not arise much. We have recently become aware of a possibly better measure of distance between curves, <ref> [Chalana & Kim, 1996] </ref>. 5.3 Putting it all together Once we have a model of how to perturb ground-truth contours, and we have a measure of the distance between two contours, we can proceed to characterize the goodness of a deformable model's objective function.

In this, we followed <ref> [Cootes et al., 1993] </ref>, although they trained a small number of preselected feature points. We seek an accurate boundary everywhere, so we wish to respond to image data everywhere along the contour, rather than just at a few points.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [Kass et al., 1987] </ref>, the authors introduced a flexible shape model that moved until it maximized some combination (energy) of its smoothness and the cumulative strength and proximity of nearby image edges. <p> Best is measured by an arbitrary real-valued objective function, or energy. The process of minimizing this energy is sometimes called a force. In the case of a contour in a 2D image, the model is called a snake <ref> [Kass et al., 1987] </ref>. As a method of segmentation it has many advantages. <p> Since blurring seems to often prevent energy functions from being able to distinguish right and wrong boundaries, and yet blurring may be necessary for gradient descent optimization, gradual deblurring is indicateda standard robust optimization technique recommended in <ref> [Kass et al., 1987] </ref>. One should not reject coarse scale out of hand, though. The reader should remember that these results, and all ratings of segmentation algorithms, are domain-specific.

Reference-contexts: This ambiguity is what foils traditional snakes in some domains. Thus, a snake must be taught about correct and incorrect shapes. Although there has been plenty of work on learning the prior probability of a shape, e.g. <ref> [Kervrann & Heitz, 1994, Lai & Chin, 1995] </ref>, there has been little on learning a model of shape likelihood given an image. 3.2 Formalizing how to learn Here, we formalize the notion of learning a general deformable model objective function based on arbitrary shape and image features.
