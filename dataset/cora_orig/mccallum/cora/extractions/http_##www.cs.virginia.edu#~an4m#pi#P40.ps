Reference-contexts: It is likely that 14.65 should be replaced by 2 + * for any * &gt; 0. Almost all transcendental numbers satisfy such an inequality. We know a few related results for the rate of algebraic approximation. The results may be pursued in <ref> [4] </ref> and [11]. We know that e is transcendental. This follows by noting that e = (1) i and applying the Gelfond-Schneider theorem [4].

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is not surprising that its properties have been studied for some twenty-five hundred years. What is surprising is how little we actually know. We know that is irrational, and have known this since Lambert's 7 proof of 1771 (see <ref> [5] </ref>). We have known that is transcendental 8 since Lindemann's 9 proof of 1882 [23]. We also know that is not a Liouville number. Mahler proved this in 1953. <p> reciprocals for the twin primes 824,633,702,441 and 824,633,702,443 and the rest, as they say, is history. 13 See Appendix - `Additional Discussion of Newton's Formula' is indicative both of the spirit in which people calculate digits and the fact that a surprising number of people have succumbed to the temptation <ref> [5] </ref>. The history of efforts to determine an accurate value for the constant we now know as is almost as long as the history of civilization itself. By 2000 B.C. both the Babylonians and the Egyptians knew to nearly two decimal places. <p> Within the next few years 19 many hundreds of millions 20 of digits will no doubt have been similarly computed.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms 1 and 2 are based on modular identities of orders 4 and 5 respectively. The underlying quintic modular identity in Algorithm 2 (the relation for s n ) is also due to Ramanujan, though the first proof is due to Berndt and appears in <ref> [7] </ref>. One intention in writing this article is to explain the genesis of Sum 1 and of Algorithms 1 and 2. It is not possible to give a short self-contained account without assuming an unusual degree of familiarity with modular function theory. <p> 2 5fi 3 (q 25 ) = 1 + r 1 + r 2 ; (6:1) where for i = 1 and 2 r i := 2 p with x := fi 3 (q) This slightly rewritten form of entry 12 (iii) of Chapter 19 of Ramanujan's Second Notebook (see <ref> [7] </ref>, where Berndt's proofs may be studied). One can think of Ramanujan's quintic modular equation as an equation in the multiplier M p of (5.13). The initial surprise is that it is solvable. <p> In particular this can be used to calculate the second block of n binary digits of without calculating the first n binary digits. This beautiful observation, due to Holloway, results, disappointingly, in no intrinsic reduction in complexity. 9 Sources References <ref> [7] </ref>, [11], [19], [26], [36], and [37] relate directly to Ramanujan's work.

Reference-contexts: Bailey in January 1986 computed over 29 million digits using Algorithm 1 on a Cray 2 [2]. Kanada, using a related quadratic algorithm (due in basis to Gauss and made explicit by Brent <ref> [12] </ref> and Salamin [27]) and using Algorithm 1 for a check, verified 33,554,000 digits.

Reference-contexts: The reason this scheme is used is that the discrete Fourier transform may be computed much more rapidly using some variation of the well-known "fast Fourier transform" (FFT) algorithm <ref> [13] </ref>. In particular, if N = 2 m , then the discrete Fourier transform may be evaluated in only 5m2 m arithmetic operations using an FFT. <p> Also, it is possible to dispense with complex numbers altogether in favor of performing computations in fields of integers modulo large prime numbers.

Reference-contexts: The best we can say about these three particular constants is that they cannot satisfy any polynomial of degree eight or less with integer coefficients of average size less than 10 9 [3]. This is a consequence of some recent computations employing the Ferguson-Forcade algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>.

It rests on a modular identity of order 58 and, like much of Ramanujan's work, appears without proof and with only scanty motivation. The first derivation we know of appears in [11]. Algorithms 1 and 2 are based on modular identities of orders 4 and 5 respectively. <p> that ff 58 = 29 + 5 ! 6 p p p One can, in principle, and for N := 58, probably in practice, solve for k N by directly solving the N th-order equation W N (k 2 N ) = 0: For N = 58 given that Ramanujan <ref> [26] </ref> and Weber [38] have calculated g 58 for us, verification by this method is somewhat easier though it still requires a tractable form of W 58 . Actually, more sophisticated number-theoretic techniques exist for computing k N (these numbers are called singular moduli). <p> Actually, more sophisticated number-theoretic techniques exist for computing k N (these numbers are called singular moduli).

An inspection of Theorem 5 shows that all constants in Series 1 are determined from g 58 . <p> Once again, there are very good number-theoretic reasons, presumably unknown to Ramanujan, why this must be so (58 is at least a good candidate number for such a reduction). Ramanujan's insight into this marvelous simplification remains obscure.

Reference-contexts: Usual multiplication of two n-digit integers has bit complexity O (n 2 ) and no better. However, it is possible to multiply two n-digit integers with complexity O (n (log n)(log log n)). This result is due to Schonhage and Strassen and dates from 1971 <ref> [29] </ref>. It provides the best bound known for multiplication. No multiplication can have speed better than O (n). Unhappily, more exact results aren't available. The original observation that a faster than O (n 2 ) multiplication is possible was due to Karatsuba in 1962. <p> This beautiful observation, due to Holloway, results, disappointingly, in no intrinsic reduction in complexity. 9 Sources References [7], [11], [19], [26], [36], and [37] relate directly to Ramanujan's work.

Reference-contexts: The advent of computers has greatly increased the scope and decreased the toil of such calculations. Metropolis, Reitwieser, and von Neumann computed and analyzed 2037 digits using Machin's formula on ENIAC in 1949. In 1961, Dan Shanks and Wrench calculated 100,000 digits on an IBM 7090 <ref> [31] </ref>. By 1973, still using Machin-like arctan expansions, the million digit mark was passed by Guilloud and Bouyer on a CDC 7600. iii) Transformation Methods The third technique, based on the transformation theory of elliptic integrals, provides the algorithms for the most recent set of computations. <p> This beautiful observation, due to Holloway, results, disappointingly, in no intrinsic reduction in complexity. 9 Sources References [7], [11], [19], [26], [36], and [37] relate directly to Ramanujan's work.
