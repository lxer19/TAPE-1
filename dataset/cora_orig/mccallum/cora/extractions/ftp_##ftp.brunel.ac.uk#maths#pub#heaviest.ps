Title: Vertex heaviest paths and cycles in quasi-transitive digraphs  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Gregory Gutin 
Address: Denmark  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Odense University,  
Abstract: A digraph D is called a quasi-transitive digraph (QTD) if for any triple x; y; z of distinct vertices of D such that (x; y) and (y; z) are arcs of D there is at least one arc from x to z or from z to x. Solving a conjecture by J. Bang-Jensen and J. Huang (J. Graph Theory, to appear), G. Gutin (Australas. J. Combin., to appear) described polynomial algorithms for finding a Hamiltonian cycle and a Hamiltonian path (if it exists) in a QTD. The approach taken in that paper cannot be used to find a longest path or cycle in polynomial time. We present a principally new approach that leads to polynomial algorithms for finding vertex heaviest paths and cycles in QTD's with non-negative weights on the vertices. This, in particular, provides an answer to a question by N. Alon on longest paths and cycles in QTD's.

Reference-contexts: A circulation is a flow with value 0. A circulation is a cycle flow if the digraph induced by the arcs with non-zero flow is just a (directed) cycle. The following observation can be easily proved analogously to Theorem 7.2 in <ref> [2] </ref>. Proposition 3.2 Every integral flow of value k 0 can be decomposed into k flows of value 1 along (s,t)-paths and a number of cycle flows.

Reference-contexts: In particular, one can solve the longest path and cycle problems as well as the X-cyclicity problem (find a cycle through a given set X of vertices, if one exists) for QTD's in time O (n 5 ). 2 Totally -decomposable digraphs The terminology is rather standard, generally following <ref> [3] </ref>. By a cycle (path) we mean a simple directed cycle (path, respectively). A trivial digraph is a digraph without arcs. Let R be a digraph on r vertices v 1 ; :::; v r and let H 1 ; :::; H r be a disjoint collection of digraphs.

Reference-contexts: This will be done later using some results on both extended semicomplete digraphs and flows in networks. We start with theorems on 4 flows in networks. We use standard terminology on the topic, the undefined terms can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. We consider a network N = (V; A; s; t; b) with source s, sink t and a capacity function b on the arc set A. A flow f on N is called integral if, for every arc a 2 A, f (a) is a non-negative integer.

Reference-contexts: Below we present a few results on maximum cost flows. They can all be derived in an analogous way to their counterparts for minimum cost flow (see e.g. pages 109-110 in <ref> [11] </ref>). We recall the definition of the residual network N (f ) = (V; A (f ); s; t; ). <p> Then f + * P (here we mean arc-wise addition) is a maximum cost flow with value k 1 in N . Proposition 3.5 can be proved analogously to Theorem 8.12 in <ref> [11] </ref>. In our applications, we consider networks with costs and capacities only on the vertices. <p> To find f k we construct a maximum cost path from t to s in N (f k+1 ). Such a path can be obtained in time O (nm) using an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm described in <ref> [11] </ref>, p. 93 (we just change the sign of the costs and find a minimum cost path in a digraph without negative cost cycles). 6 Now we consider some properties of paths and cycles in extended semi--complete digraphs which were obtained in [5, 6].
