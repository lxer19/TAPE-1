Title: ABSTRACT  
Keyword: Automated visual presentation design, knowledge engineering, planning, interaction handling.  
Abstract: We summarize the motivation, the approach, and the significance of a thesis that is concerned with automating the design of visual discourse. To synthesize effective visual discourse, three design criteria are used: coherence, versatility, and interactivity. The thesis focuses on finding comprehensive and systematic methodologies that meet these criteria, and on developing practical ways to implement visual discourse synthesis systems.

Reference-contexts: Previous research in this area has focused on designing individual presentations (e.g., [3, 4]), or planning sequences of predominantly static presentations (e.g., <ref> [1, 5] </ref>). However, full attention has not been paid to designing visual discourse. We use the term visual discourse to refer to a series of connected displays, of which a single display or a series of static displays may be considered special cases.

Reference-contexts: Versatile discourse is capable of presenting heterogeneous information (e.g., quantitative and qualitative) through different visual techniques (e.g., 2D charts and graphs or 3D animation sequences), using coordinated visual media (e.g., generated graphics, image and video). Interactive discourse presents visual affordances <ref> [2] </ref> that indicate that it can react to user interaction. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, this thesis also describes how to implement a working visual discourse system.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Visual design automation is an emerging research field that has demonstrated some of its early promise in coping with large volumes of information in a timely, customized manner. Previous research in this area has focused on designing individual presentations (e.g., <ref> [3, 4] </ref>), or planning sequences of predominantly static presentations (e.g., [1, 5]). However, full attention has not been paid to designing visual discourse.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an interactive but interruptible visual discourse should be produced. While designing interactive visual presentations involves analyzing various interaction metaphors and styles to produce visual affordances, providing an interruptible visual discourse requires reactive planning <ref> [6] </ref>. In order to resume, the system must maintain a presentation execution history to record when the interruption occurred, what actions have been performed, and what actions are yet to be carried out. Furthermore, the system replans based on the result of the current user interaction.

Reference-contexts: INFERENCE MODELING Visual discourse design is an inferencing process. Our approach achieves design efficiency by modeling visual discourse as a set of temporally constrained visual actions. A visual action is an encoded graphic design technique (e.g., Move ?x). A hierarchical planning approach <ref> [7] </ref> would be particularly suitable for the design task. Our research adapts a generic hierarchical planning algorithm to this domain by adding visual design constraints based on coherence, versatility, and interactivity requirements [10].

Visual Hierarchy. We are designing a visual hierarchy to systematically define various visual forms and their relations at different levels of abstraction, based on their syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

Reference-contexts: A visual action is an encoded graphic design technique (e.g., Move ?x). A hierarchical planning approach [7] would be particularly suitable for the design task. Our research adapts a generic hierarchical planning algorithm to this domain by adding visual design constraints based on coherence, versatility, and interactivity requirements <ref> [10] </ref>. As a result, the inference engine achieves computational efficiency by reducing the amount of search needed compared to search-based approaches. It also eases the task of knowledge encoding by reusing the actions that are common to many design tasks.
