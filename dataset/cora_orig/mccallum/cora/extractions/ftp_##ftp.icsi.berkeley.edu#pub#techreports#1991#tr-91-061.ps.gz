Abstract: The algebraic structure of combinatory differential fields is constructed to provide a semantics for computations in analysis. In this setting programs, approximations, limits and operations of analysis are represented as algebraic terms. Analytic algorithms can be derived by algebraic methods. The main tool in this construction are combinatory models which are inner algebras of Engeler graph models. As an universal domain of denotational semantics the lattice structure of the graph models allows to give a striking simple semantics for computations with approximations. As models of combinatory algebra they provide all essential computational constructs, including recursion. Combinatory models are constructed as extensions of first order theories. The classical first order theory to describe analysis is the theory of differential fields. It turns out that two types of computational constructs, namely composition and piecewise definition of functions, are preferably introduced as extensions of the differential fields theory. Combinatory differential fields are then the combinatory models of these enriched differential fields. We show for basic algorithms of computational analysis how their combinatory counterparts are derived in the algebraic setting. We illustrate how these algorithms are suitable to be implemented in a computer algebra environment like mathematica.

Reference-contexts: We denote the theory of differential fields extended with composition and conditional axioms with CDF F . For this theory the following decidability result was shown in <ref> [Aberer, 1991] </ref> over a real closed constant field: 12 Theorem 3 For a conditional term t (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ), consisting of the constant symbols 0; 1 and the function symbols +; ; fl; ffi and cond the problem 8x 1 : : : x <p> For an unary -operator x (t 0 ) this can be expressed by an induction axiom of the following kind. ((t n (t 0 )) ^ 8x ((x) ! t (x))) ! ( x (t 0 )): It was shown in <ref> [Aberer, 1991] </ref> that every structure without -operator can be extended to one with -operator, satisfying this axiom, but on the cost of introducing nonstandard elements. 12 The theory of real closed fields can be axiomatized by an infinite set of axioms. 38 Example. The same example as before. <p> On the contrary, we wanted to give a starting point to a new way to view algorithmic analysis in an algebraic framework. So many questions and directions for further investigations are left open. Some of these we have already considered in this work, some ideas can be found in <ref> [Aberer, 1991] </ref>, others are left out completely. We want to give some hints how the theory of combinatory differential fields could be continued. <p> It would also be most wishful to develop a computer algebra system based on the principles of combinatory models. A way how this could be realized in the computer algebra language Scratchpad [Jenks et al., 1988] was sketched in <ref> [Aberer, 1991] </ref>. The use of this abstract data type language allows to implement generic algorithms independently of the knowledge representation and to use them afterwards in different retracted combinatory differential fields. In [Blum et al., 1989] the concept of a recursively enumerable set of real numbers was introduced. <p> It is easy to see that a set recursively enumerable in this sense is exactly the complement of a set that can be described by a combinatory term and hence possesses a recursively enumerable approximation. It was also shown in <ref> [Aberer, 1991] </ref> that functions computable in the sense of recursive analysis can be approximated by combinators up to standard equality. So the question is which sets (of functions) can be approximated by combinators and which not.

Reference-contexts: The axioms are chosen such that results about normal forms and decidability are obtainable. In this way terms built up with field operations, composition and conditionals can be understood as a natural extension of the rational terms. The axioms are a modified version of those given in <ref> [Engeler, 1990] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A first step was given in this work. Other methods have to be discussed for boundary value problems and then partial differential equations. A rich source of experience in this direction can be found in the recent developments of interval methods and methods of verified inclusions <ref> [Weissinger, 1988] </ref>. As the examples have shown, combinatory differential fields are not only useful for theoretic discussions but give a good starting point for implementations.
