Title: Multicasting Multimedia Streams with Active Networks  
Author: Albert Banchs Wolfgang Effelsberg Christian Tschudin Volker Turau 
Keyword: Active Network, ANTS, M0, robust audio, scalable video, layered video  
Pubnum: TR-97-050  
Abstract: Active networks allow code to be loaded dynamically into network nodes at runtime. This code can perform tasks specific to a stream of packets or even a single packet. In this paper we compare two active network architectures: the Active Network Transfer System (ANTS) and the Messenger System (M0). We have implemented a robust audio multicast protocol and a layered video multicast protocol with both active network systems. We discuss the differences of the two systems, evaluate architectural strengths and weaknesses, compare the runtime performance, and report practical e x-perience and lessons learned.

Reference-contexts: For example, in a lossy network environment we could add redundancy to protect the data, giving a higher priority to the most important pieces of data by adding more redundancy to the lower layer packets. This would be similar to ICSIs Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) a p-proach <ref> [AL96] </ref> but adapted for layered video and i mplemented hop-by-hop rather than end-to-end. We will now illustrate the code the programmer has to write for each of the two active network systems. As an example we present the routine that filters the video multicast active packets at ru n-time.

Reference-contexts: Some researchers oppose to the use of active network technology in the main data path; they claim that dynamically loadable code can never be efficient enough. In <ref> [Bra97] </ref> B. Braden describes a signaling protocol based on active network technology; for signaling the code efficiency is not as crit i-cal as for the data path.

Reference-contexts: It is a protocol for i m-proved-quality multicast audio transmission over best-effort networks, based on an encoder/decoder developed by M. Isenburg and H. Chordura at ICSI <ref> [Ise97] </ref>. The encoding is based on wavelets, and the system is called WAR (Wavelet Audio Radio). In our protocol, the link between the audio server and each audio client is subdivided into several point-to-point links internal to the active network.

Reference-contexts: In [Bra97] B. Braden describes a signaling protocol based on active network technology; for signaling the code efficiency is not as crit i-cal as for the data path. Using active packets for network diagnostics, monitoring and auto-configuration is proposed in <ref> [JP97] </ref>. 6 Conclusions We have successfully implemented a robust audio multicast protocol and a layered video multicast protocol with the two active network systems ANTS and M0.

Reference-contexts: For example a media scaling mechanism for MPEG video could be the dynamic adjustment of the quantization parameter at the encoding site as a function of the QoS parameters of a link. An example for media scaling can be found in <ref> [KW95] </ref>, and filtering mechanisms are described in [YMH96]. The RSVP protocol is designed to carry resource reservation packets in the Internet. The protocol itself does not specify what resources it deals with.

Reference-contexts: The redundancy generated in our current version is based on a simple XOR scheme; a more sophisticated adaptive redundancy could also be easily i m-plemented <ref> [LBET93] </ref>. A major advantage of radio broadcast is that delay is not a critical factor: a signal that arrives with a few seconds delay can still be said to be real-time since there is not imm e-diate feedback from the receiver to the sender.

McCanne of UC Berkeley explicitly addresses the composition and transmi s-sion of a layered video stream for multicast networks <ref> [McC96] </ref>. McCanne has developed his own layered video encoding scheme, based on a combination of DCT and wavelets (unlike the subband coding used in our experiments, see [TCZ96][TZ94]). His system was designed for operation over multicast IP, without special code in the routers.

Reference-contexts: Good overviews of active network projects can be found in [Ten97] and [Mun97]. There are many similarities between active networks and mobile agent systems (mobile code). A good overview of mobile agent projects can be found in <ref> [RP97] </ref>. The main difference is that active networks use the concepts for network layer processing whereas mobile agent systems run as appl i-cation programs. Both have dynamic code deployment, caching, resource control and many other components on common.

Reference-contexts: The main goal of our work is to gain practical experience with two major active network systems, the ANTS system developed at MIT [WGT98] and the M0 system developed in Switzerland <ref> [Tsch97] </ref>. We have installed both systems on a network of Sun workstations, and we have impl e-mented two experimental multicast protocols on each system. Both protocols inherently require processing within the internal nodes of a network and are thus good examples for our purpose.

Reference-contexts: Tan and A. Zakhor [TCZ96]. It is based on subband coding, a nonstandard but very efficient video coding technology <ref> [TZ94] </ref>. Each packet in the encoded stream carries a layer identifier; the data in each packet belongs to one layer only. Thus the filtering in our active nodes is very simple: we can throw away entire packets if their data is not needed downstream.

Reference-contexts: The protocol itself does not specify what resources it deals with. The designers explicitly mention the inclusion of packet filters into the data path of an IP stream at each network node; all packets passing through a particular filter share a particular resource <ref> [ZDE93, BZE96] </ref>. In principle RSVP could be used to pipe an incoming packet stream through a video layer filter very similar to ours. However, the di f-ference to our system would be that with RSVP, the code for the filters has to be installed in all routers beforehand .
