Reference-contexts: Predicates of the form etc i (x), as in the second rule, denote conditions that are stated elsewhere, or, for some natural kind terms, can not be fully enumerated, but can only be assumed. They seem to be related to the abnormal predicates, ab (x) used in circumscription theory <ref> (McCarthy 1986) </ref>. Below are two interpretations of L.

Reference-contexts: As our previous criticisms have shown, a single number cannot represent even the cost and quality of an explanation, much less these additional factors. Also note that to constrain search, it is important to consider bottom-up clues, as in (Charniak 1986) and <ref> (Norvig 1987) </ref>. It would be a mistake to use the rules given here in a strictly top-down manner, just because they are reminiscent of Prolog rules. (3) There is no notion of a good or bad interpretation, except as an epiphenomenon of the interpretation rules.
