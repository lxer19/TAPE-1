Abstract: Donoho and Johnstone's WaveShrink procedure has proven valuable for signal de-noising and non-parametric regression. WaveShrink is based on the principle of shrinking wavelet coefficients towards zero to remove noise. WaveShrink has very broad asymptotic near-optimality properties. In this paper, we introduce a new shrinkage scheme, semisoft, which generalizes hard and soft shrinkage. We study the properties of the shrinkage functions, and demonstrate that semisoft shrinkage offers advantages over both hard shrinkage (uniformly smaller risk and less sensitivity to small perturbations in the data) and soft shrinkage (smaller bias and overall L 2 risk). We also construct approximate pointwise confidence intervals for WaveShrink and address the problem of threshold selection.

Like soft shrinkage, semisoft shrinkage is continuous. <p> The bottom panel displays the sliding window WaveShrink estimates for semisoft shrinkage. Minimax thresholds are used for both hard and semisoft shrinkage and the scale of the noise is re-estimated for each window. 3 BIAS AND VARIANCE ESTIMATION From step <ref> [4] </ref> of the algorithm, the WaveShrink estimate can be written as ^ f i = k where ^w k are defined in (3). Therefore, we have Theorem 2.
