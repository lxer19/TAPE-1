Title: Abstract  
Abstract: The Dreiding force field is a seven-term equation that describes the potential energy in a molecule as a function of the relative positions of bonded atoms and electrostatic interactions between atoms that do not share a bond. For large molecules such as DNA, with several thousand atoms, the nonbonded terms can require a significant amount of computation. In this paper we present a data-parallel algorithm that takes time on processors. We compare the execution time of our algorithm on a MasPar MP-1 with an efficient sequential program running on an SGI workstation.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6 we give a table that shows the energy values with and without cutoffs. We also compare the execution times of a serial algorithm running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation (part of a commercial package named BIOGRAF <ref> [1] </ref>) and our parallel algorithm running on a MasPar MP-1. n 2 O n ( ) n 2 n A Parallel Algorithm for Calculating the Potential Energy in DNA John S. Conery, * Warner L. <p> The virtual ring was implemented via the X-net, a nearest neighbor communication channel with toroidal wrap. To make sure our program was producing the correct results and to compare our parallel algorithm with a very good serial algorithm we used BIOGRAF <ref> [1] </ref> to compute the free energy in seven molecules, ranging in size from 13 atoms to 2544 atoms. We ran BIOGRAF on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 1 workstation. We then computed the energy of the same seven molecules on the MasPar. The timing results are listed in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: This approach uses an experimental technique such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or Raman spectroscopy to provide an initial conformation and then uses a minimization algorithm to find the lowest energy conformation in the neighborhood of the starting point (e.g <ref> [2] </ref>). In this paper we describe a new data-parallel algorithm for calculating the energy of a single conformation of a DNA molecule. Our algorithm will compute the potential energy in a molecule with atoms, taking into account the interactions between all the atoms.

Reference-contexts: A longer range project will be to investigate a parallel minimization technique. The visitor algorithm should be easy to implement on a general parallel machine. It will be simple to code it for SPMD execution in a language such as Dataparallel C <ref> [3] </ref> or High Performance Fortran and let compilers for those languages allocate atoms to processors.

Reference-contexts: To date, only a few solution structures have been solved because without other supporting experimental data (such as NMR data) there are a large number of calculations which need to be performed. Raman spectroscopy provides information about the energy (frequency) of the vibrations within a molecule <ref> [5] </ref>. Data are obtained by shining a monochromatic laser on the sample and detecting the light being scattered. A mono-chromator separates the light into its component frequencies, and a photomultiplier tube detects the intensity of light of the different frequencies.
