Title: Triangular Canonical Forms for Lattice Rules of Prime-Power Order  
Author: J. N. Lyness and S. Joe 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of t-cycle D Z representations for s-dimensional lattice rules of prime-power order. Of particular interest are canonical forms that, by definition, have a D-matrix consisting of the nontrivial invariants. Among these is a family of triangular forms, which, besides being canonical, have the defining property that their Z-matrix is a column-permuted version of a unit upper-triangular matrix. Triangular forms may be obtained constructively by using sequences of elementary transformations based on elementary matrix algebra. Our main result is to define a unique canonical form for prime-power rules. This ultratriangular form is a triangular form, is easy to recognize, and may be derived in a straightforward manner.

Reference-contexts: This property is of interest in its own right, but we would have preferred some more elegant property to define the term invariant. The principal result (the unique canonical form) of this paper is confined to prime-power rules. In a recent paper <ref> [JS94] </ref> it is noted that any lattice rule may be expressed as a direct sum of prime-power rules. Our hope is that the present work will pave the way for results of wider generality, perhaps by exploitation of that direct sum.

Reference-contexts: The reader who is already familiar with this theory may omit the first part of this section. A nonabstract interpretation of an invariant as the order of some subgroup has been exploited by Lyness <ref> [L93] </ref>. To make this paper self-contained, we wish to establish 8 Theorem 4.1 without recourse to group theory. To this end we need to construct an independent definition of the invariants of an s-dimensional rule Q. To do this, we first introduce the projections of an s-dimensional lattice rule. <p> An interesting feature of this paper is that no use has been made of group theory, as in [SL89]; of lattice theory (in the form of generator matrices), as in [LSo93] or [LK95]; or even of the order property of individual lattice points, as in <ref> [L93] </ref>. The entire theory is developed independently, starting from an elementary definition (1.1) and employing only elementary transformations of integer matrices D and Z. The bibliography is composed of related papers. None are needed to understand this paper.

Such a form is termed a canonical form. The above was established in <ref> [SL89] </ref> for all lattice rules. In the context of prime-power rules, clearly any triangular form as defined in the preceding section satisfies these conditions to be a canonical form. <p> That is, a different reduction of a different representation of Q cannot lead to a different sequential D-matrix. This justifies our use of the term invariant without any recourse to the underlying group theory required in <ref> [SL89] </ref>. We now restate Theorem 3.10 in a trivially modified form. Theorem 4.6 Let Q be a prime-power rule, having rank r and invariants n 1 , n 2 ; : : :, n r . Let Q [t; D; Z; s] be any D Z form representing Q. <p> An interesting feature of this paper is that no use has been made of group theory, as in <ref> [SL89] </ref>; of lattice theory (in the form of generator matrices), as in [LSo93] or [LK95]; or even of the order property of individual lattice points, as in [L93].
