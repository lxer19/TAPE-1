Abstract: We describe how to investigate collections of trace data representing network delivery of multimedia information with Chitra95, a tool that allows a user to visualize, query, statistically analyze and test, transform, and model collections of trace data. Chitra95 is applied to characterize World Wide Web (WWW) traffic from three workloads: students in a classroom of network-connected workstations, graduate students browsing the Web, undergraduates browsing educational and other materials, as well as traffic on a courseware repository server. We explore the inter-access time of files on a server (i.e., recency), the hit rate from a proxy server cache, and the distributions of file sizes and media types requested. The traffic study also yields statistics on the effectiveness of caching to improve transfer rates. In contrast to past WWW traffic studies, we analyze client as well as server traffic; we compare three workloads rather than drawing conclusions from one workload; and we analyze tcpdump logs to calculate the performance improvement in throughput that an end user sees due to caching.

Reference-contexts: Tools to analyze WWW trace files of server traffic include wwwstat <ref> [3] </ref>, gwstat [8], and WEBVIZ [12]. The tool wwwstat can generate the following reports about a log from an NCSA httpd server: the number of requests the server receives and the number of bytes in the server response.

Reference-contexts: The course use of the Web at Virginia Tech is targeted to exploit multimedia, primarily through a project to create a digital library that allows students to obtain on-line copies of papers used in class. <ref> [4] </ref>. Other multimedia types of class material include scanned images of diagrams, photographs, and links to servers outside of the Virginia Tech campus. If the use of network delivery grows in popularity on college campuses, then a significant amount of campus network and even Internet related traffic will be education-related.

Reference-contexts: A variety of caching mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., <ref> [5, 7, 9, 13] </ref>). <p> the distribution of inter-access times of files after 30 minutes and an increase between 24 and 28 days (because students are likely to work at the same time of day on successive days). * We did not get the 50% improvement with caching server accesses that was noted by Glassman <ref> [5] </ref>. In our experiments, we were caching client off-campus accesses at a proxy server; thus the proxy server was a cache for the off-campus portion of the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Ability to generate a workload model: Chitra95 can generate one of three types of workload models: a semi-Markov process, a model based on the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) procedure <ref> [6] </ref> to find events in traces that are likely to occur in combination with other events, and a novel time-dependent stochastic process. Tool extensibility: Chitra95 is a toolkit that consists of a set of small programs that communicate through a standard, self-describing file format.

Reference-contexts: Chitra95 provides novel visualizations to represent the time evolution of categorical data. Ability to perform statistical tests about ensembles: The primary test in Chitra95 is the Kruskall-Wallis (KW) rank sum <ref> [11, pp. 422-425] </ref>, which tests the hypothesis that two or more samples are drawn from the same distribution. The implementation includes the correction for the case when the samples include many ties. The KW test is used because it makes no assumption about the underlying distribution of the data.
