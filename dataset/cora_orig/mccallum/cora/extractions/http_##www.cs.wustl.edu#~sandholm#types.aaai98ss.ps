Abstract: Contract Types for Satisficing Task Allocation: I Theoretical Results Abstract We analyze task reallocation where individually rational (IR) agents (re)contract tasks among themselves based on marginal costs. A task allocation graph is introduced as a tool for analyzing contract types. Traditional single task contracts always have a short path (sequence of contracts) to the optimal task allocation but an IR path may not exist, or it may not be short. We analyze an algorithm for finding the shortest IR path. Next we introduce cluster contracts, swaps, and multi-agent contracts. Each of the four contract types avoids some local optima that the others do not. Even if the protocol is equipped with all four types, local optima exist. To attack this problem, we introduce OCSM-contracts which combine the ideas behind the four earlier types into an atomic contract type. If the protocol is equipped with OCSM-contracts, any sequence of IR contracts leads to the optimal task allocation in a finite number of steps: an oracle|or speculation|is not needed for choosing the path (no subset of OCSM-contracts suffices even with an oracle). This means that the multiagent search does not need to backtrack. This is a powerful result for small problem instances. For large ones, the anytime feature of our multi-contract-type algorithm|with provably monotonic improvement of each agent's solution|is more important. 1

Reference-contexts: If the search terminates without reaching the optimal vertex, no IR path exists. It is known that breadth-first-search runs in O (v + e) time, where v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges in the graph <ref> (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest 1990) </ref>. 6 There is one vertex for each task allocation, so v = jAj jTj . The number of edges is the same at each vertex: jT j (jAj 1).

Reference-contexts: In some non-automated allocation settings, the need for clusters has recently been realized. For example, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auctions airwave bandwidth for restricted geographical areas, the bidders' valuations for the auctioned items depend on what other items they are awarded <ref> (McAfee & McMillan 1996) </ref>. For example, some bidders want to receive a cluster of awards that allows them to establish nationwide coverage. In the FCC auctions, explicit clustering was not used, but the agents could construct the clusters from individually auctioned items.

Reference-contexts: Finally, combinations of these contracts types are discussed. Marginal cost based contracting The original contract net (Smith 1980) lacked a formal model for making bidding and awarding decisions. 2 This definition generalizes what are called "Task Oriented Domains" <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994) </ref>. Specifically, we allow asymmetric cost functions among agents (e.g. due to different resources). We also allow for the possibility that some agent may be unable to handle some sets of tasks.

Reference-contexts: Yet there may be a beneficial swap of tasks where the first agent subcontracts a task to the second and the second subcontracts another task to the first <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995) </ref>. We now formalize this concept: Definition 4 A swap contract (S-contract) is defined by a 4-tuple hT i;j ; T j;i ; i;j ; j;i i, where jT i;j j = jT j;i j = 1.

Reference-contexts: If the new highest bid was lower than the old one, the withdrawing agent had to pay the difference. Alternatively, the decommitting penalties could have been fixed when the item was first auctioned. Deceitful decommitting strategies in such protocols have been game theoretically analyzed in <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1996) </ref>. In general, a cluster can encompass any number of tasks. 7 A task allocation is called k-optimal if no beneficial cluster contract of any k tasks can be made between any two agents. Now, m-optimality does not imply n-optimality when m &lt; n. <p> This risk can be reduced|as much as desired|by a leveled commitment contracting protocol where agents can back out of contracts by paying penalties <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1996) </ref>. If the later contracts in the sequence do not happen, the agent can decommit from the earlier ones. Future work should more closely analyze how best to combine OCSM-contracts and leveled commitment contracts.

Reference-contexts: Such a model would allow one to develop methods that provably lead to desirable task allocations among agents. We follow the approach of <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref>, where contracting decisions are based on marginal cost calculations. In so doing we invoke the concept of individual rationality on a per contract basis. <p> It follows that social welfare increases monotonically. Details on an asynchronous distributed contract net implementation based on marginal costs can be found in <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref>. Classic contracts of one task at a time (O-contracts) In most contract net implementations, each contract regards only one task (Smith 1980; Sen 1993; Gu & Ishida 1995). <p> Recently, the TRACONET system extended the contract net to handle task interactions by having the announcer cluster tasks into sets to be negotiated atomically <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref>. Alternatively, the bidder could have done the clustering by counterproposing. Later, a protocol was presented that generalizes this by allowing either party to do the clustering at any stage of the protocol (Sand-holm & Lesser 1995). <p> On the other hand, for large problem instances, the number of contracts made before the optimal task allocation is reached may be impractically large|albeit finite. For example on a large-scale real-world distributed vehicle routing problem instance, TRACONET <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref> never reached even a local optimum even with just O-contracts|with multiple hours of negotiation time on five Unix machines.

Reference-contexts: In many domains, significant savings can be achieved by reallocating tasks among agents. Some tasks are inherently synergic, and should therefore be handled by the same 1 Supported by NSF CAREER award IRI-9703122 and NSF grant IRI-9610122. A one-page poster on this work was published in <ref> (Sandholm 1997) </ref>. An experimental analysis of these contract types is presented in (Andersson & Sandholm 1998; 1997). agent. On the other hand, some tasks have negative interactions, in which case it is better to allocate them to different agents.

Reference-contexts: a local optimum with respect to mutual (O-, C-, and S-) contracts of any size, solution enhancements may be possible if tasks were transferred among more than two agents. 8 8 Sathi and Fox studied the role of grouping buy and sell bids into cascades which may involve multiple agents <ref> (Sathi & Fox 1989) </ref>. Their setting is simpler than ours in that the value of a contract to an agent does not depend on which other ones of the agent's bids get accepted.
