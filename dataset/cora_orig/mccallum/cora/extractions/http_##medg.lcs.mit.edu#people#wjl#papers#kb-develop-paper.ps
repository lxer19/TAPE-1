Abstract: This paper reports on a formative evaluation of the diagnostic capabilities of the Heart Failure Program, which uses a probability network and a heuristic hypothesis generator. Using 242 cardiac cases collected from discharge summaries at a tertiary care hospital, we compared the diagnoses of the program to diagnoses collected from cardiologists using the same information as was available to the program. With some adjustments to the knowledge base, the Heart Failure Program produces appropriate diagnoses about 90% of the time on this training set. The main reasons for the inappropriate diagnoses of the remaining 10% include inadequate reasoning with temporal relations between cause and effect, severity relations, and independence of acute and chronic diseases.

Reference-contexts: The program can also suggest other measurements to refine the diagnosis and therapies to manage the problem, and can predict the hemodynamic effects of the therapies, but only the differential diagnosis is addressed by the experiments described in this paper (see other papers about other aspects of the system <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>). This paper reports on a formative evaluation of the diagnostic capabilities of the Heart Failure Program (HFP). The process of formative evaluation combines aspects of system development with assessment of effectiveness and was undertaken with specific objectives in mind.

Reference-contexts: The non-cardiac diseases are not further differentiated. That is, there is a node for primary liver disease but not for any specific types of liver disease. The probabilities on the links between nodes are combined using a "noisy-or" combination rule <ref> [4] </ref> except for special links called worsening factors, which increase the probability of another cause but are insufficient to produce the effect alone, and correcting factors, which decrease the probability. <p> The model is similar to those investigated by Pearl <ref> [4] </ref> as Bayesian probability networks. However, this model has forward loops (excluded by Pearl), some probabilities that are conditional on other nodes in the hypothesis, and nodes with multiple paths between them (handled only in exponential time by Pearl's methods). Thus heuristic methods are necessary to reason about the model.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the program can have probabilities that are too low on hypotheses involving multiple chronic diseases and probabilities that are too high on ones with multiple acute diseases. (This problem is addressed in a recent paper <ref> [5] </ref>.) Because of the low probability of primary diseases, the program has a tendency to invoke relatively unusual causal mechanisms rather than add a new primary disease.
