Title: Abstract  
Abstract: The process of volume rendering is computationally intensive especially when high quality imaging is required. We present an approach to realistic volume rendering which is based on a distributed system with a workstation front-end for scene composition and pre-visualization, and a supercomputer serving as the primary rendering engine. We report on a new expedient method for extending arbitrary surface-based ray tracers to support realistic rendering of volumes. In addition, we describe a method for supporting ray-tracing of a volume manipulated by CSG operations. Finally, an efficient forward projection algorithm which exploits the multiprocessor, vector-arithmetic capabilities of the CRAY Y-MP supercomputer is described.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION With the increased speed and decreased cost of advanced workstations, the use of the computer in providing complex visualizations is becoming more commonplace in many biomedical disciplines. Advances in acquisition devices such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are providing increasingly higher spatial and temporal resolution <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. The research conducted at the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD) by our interdisciplinary group over the past three years has investigated a supercomputer/workstation, distributed, processing environment for 3-D brain visualization for use by clinicians, educators, and medical researchers [10, 11].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the value of the surface normal is essential for realistic rendering. In the case of geometric objects, it can be calculated from the object definition. In the case of a volumetric object, we employ the grey-level gradient method <ref> [2] </ref>. W e denote by V i,j,k the volume value at coordinate (i,j,k). The three vector components of the gradient at a grid coordinate, G x , G y , G z , are computed by central differencing.

Reference-contexts: TraceOneRay is given a ray definition and returns to Denga an intersection point as well as surface color and normal at that point. Denga, in turn, utilizes this information for spawning secondary rays and for composition of the final pixel color. Denga utilizes hierarchical bounding volumes <ref> [3] </ref> as its major technique for expediting ray-object intersection.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the intersection point of a ray with the volume data and the color at that point are determined by accumulating multiple samples along the passage of the ray through the semi-transparent volumetric material <ref> [4] </ref>. The main extension of our algorithm over existing volume rendering algorithms is its ability to support constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations. For example, Denga supports the subtraction of arbitrary objects (geometric as well as volumetric) of any size and orientation from the volume data set. <p> Hence, VolumeIntersect will return no intersection, which is exactly what we want. Extending the same basic idea to other CSG operations, such as union and intersection, is straight forward. The procedure VolumeColor implements Levoys algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> by taking samples along the given ray, mapping the sample value to color, and then attenuating this color by the local gradient. This accumulated color is used as the color of the first object-voxel intersected by the given ray.

Reference-contexts: By extending with the ability of Denga to perform volume rendering, the generation of more realistic and informative biomedical imagery is possible (see color plates). Levoy <ref> [5] </ref> reports a volume renderer that can support the rendition of geometric objects as well; however, his method deals only with primary rays and does not lend itself to inclusion in a general purpose ray tracer.

Reference-contexts: This software allows the user to generate scene descriptions (camera positioning, surface attributes, lighting, etc.) using track-based motion description. The resulting scene description is independent of the rendering algorithm. The lower-resolution representation is typically a polygonal isosurface generated with the Marching Cubes algorithm developed by Lorenson and Cline <ref> [7] </ref>. l Initial visualizations are sent to high-speed volume rendering algorithms such as conventional, polygon-renderers or forward-projection, volume-renderers (see Forward Projection) both of which can provide interactive levels of feed back. l Lower-resolution representations are substituted with the original volume data set so that final visualizations of high-quality, high image resolution

Reference-contexts: It has been observed that since the normal is calculated based on information available in relatively small neighborhood, some artifacts may appear, specifically in regions of thin surfaces <ref> [8] </ref>. Additional artifacts are manifested in the loss of surface continuity especially when the data is viewed in a direction orthogonal to the data acquisition plane. These problems can be somewhat alleviated by a more sophisticated calculation of the gradient [8, 14]. <p> Additional artifacts are manifested in the loss of surface continuity especially when the data is viewed in a direction orthogonal to the data acquisition plane.

The technique we used was to make an extension of the central difference formula in which a larger environment is sampled.

Reference-contexts: Quantitative, structural assessment of the brain could lead to improved diagnostic techniques for many afictions. For instance, combining image modalities such as MRI with electroencephalogram (EEG) will both refine EEG electrode placement techniques (heretofore error prone) and provide previously unattainable, brain structural/functional correlations <ref> [12] </ref> (see color plates). This paper presents the development of rendering algorithms that comprises a exible environment for creating realistic, biomedical imagery (specifically of the human brain) through volume visualizations. OVERVIEW For completeness, we briey describe the preliminary steps involved in our volume visualization environmentspecifically, data acquisition and data preprocessing.
