Abstract: We analyze the security of an interactive identification scheme. The scheme is the obvious extension of the original square root scheme of Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff to 2 m th roots. This scheme is quite practical, especially in terms of storage and communication complexity. Although this scheme is certainly not new, its security was apparently not fully understood. We prove that this scheme is secure if factoring integers is hard, even against active attacks where the adversary is first allowed to pose as a verifier before attempting impersonation.

Reference-contexts: These schemes, however, are somewhat more complicated and less efficient than the original schemes. Identification Schemes vs. Signatures We note that there are well-known techniques (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) using cryptographic hash functions for converting identification schemes into digital signature schemes, in which proofs of security are based on an "ideal" hash function model (the hash function is viewed as a random oracle).

Reference-contexts: Other identification schemes are based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. The scheme of Schnorr [16] is only known to be secure against passive attacks, provided the discrete logarithm problem in (a subgroup of) Z fl p , where p is prime, is hard. Brickell and McCurley <ref> [2] </ref> give a variant of Schnorr's scheme, and give a security analysis against active attacks; however, the hardness assumption is quite unnatural. Okamoto [14] gives modifications of the GQ and Schnorr schemes which are proved secure, even against active attacks, under the same intractability assumptions of the corresponding original schemes.

Reference-contexts: Related Work There are several other variants of the square root scheme, but the only other one in the literature that is secure against active attacks if factoring is hard is the Feige/Fiat/Shamir (FFS) scheme <ref> [3] </ref>. The FFS scheme is actually a parameterized family of schemes, one of which is the parallel version of the square root scheme. <p> Indeed, the results of Goldreich and Krawczyk [4] and Itoh and Sakurai [10], together with the result of Jakobsson, imply that there is no "black box" zero-knowledge simulator, assuming factoring is hard. Perhaps even more interestingly, this scheme is provably not a proof of knowledge (in the sense of <ref> [3] </ref>), assuming factoring is hard. Indeed, any knowledge extractor could be used to take square roots modulo n as follows. Given a random square c 2 Z fl n , we construct a prover P 0 with public key (c 2 m1 ; n). <p> a proof of security for the 2 m th root scheme; in x4, we make some concluding remarks, including a discussion of several minor extensions of our results. 2 Definition of Security In this section, we formally state our definition of a secure identification scheme, which is essentially that of <ref> [3] </ref>. For conciseness and clarity, we adopt the notation of [6] for expressing the probability of various events. If S is a probability space, then [S] denotes the set of elements in this space that occur with nonzero probability. <p> The probability of success, given that *(h; b; n) Q 2 (k) 1 , is at least 1=2. Let * = *(h; b; n), and assume * Q 2 (k) 1 . We use a slight variation of an argument in Feige, Fiat, and Shamir <ref> [3] </ref>. Consider the Boolean matrix M whose rows are indexed by the coin toss string ! of P 0 and whose columns are indexed by the challenges e of V . M (!; e) = 1 if and only if this choice of ! and e causes V to accept.

Reference-contexts: This approach is not at all applicable to proving the security of the 2 m th scheme. Our proof of security does not show that the 2 m th scheme is zero-knowledge (in the sense of [5]). Indeed, the results of Goldreich and Krawczyk <ref> [4] </ref> and Itoh and Sakurai [10], together with the result of Jakobsson, imply that there is no "black box" zero-knowledge simulator, assuming factoring is hard. Perhaps even more interestingly, this scheme is provably not a proof of knowledge (in the sense of [3]), assuming factoring is hard.

We employ a variation of a zero-knowledge simulation technique introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff <ref> [5] </ref>, which might be called partial zero-knowledge simulation.

Reference-contexts: Compared to the FFS scheme, the 2 m th root scheme has much smaller space and communication complexities, which makes the 2 m th root scheme much more attractive in many practical situations, such as smart card implementations.

In this scheme, the modulus n is chosen precisely as before. There are two parameters s and m, chosen so that 2 sm grows faster than any polynomial in k. Set q = 2 m .
