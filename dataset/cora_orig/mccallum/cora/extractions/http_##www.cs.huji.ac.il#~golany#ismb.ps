Abstract: We investigate the space of all protein sequences. We combine the standard measures of similarity (SW, FASTA, BLAST), to associate with each sequence an exhaustive list of neighboring sequences. These lists induce a (weighted directed) graph whose vertices are the sequences. The weight of an edge connecting two sequences represents their degree of similarity. This graph encodes much of the fundamental properties of the sequence space. We look for clusters of related proteins in this graph. These clusters correspond to strongly connected sets of vertices. Two main ideas underlie our work: i) Interesting homologies among proteins can be deduced by transitivity. ii) Transitivity should be applied restrictively in order to prevent unrelated proteins from clustering together. Our analysis starts from a very conservative classification, based on very significant similarities, that has many classes. Subsequently, classes are merged to include less significant similarities. Merging is performed via a novel two phase algorithm. First, the algorithm identifies groups of possibly related clusters (based on transitivity and strong connectivity) using local considerations, and merges them. Then, a global test is applied to identify nuclei of strong relationships within these groups of clusters, and the classification is refined accordingly. This process takes place at varying thresholds of statistical significance, where at each step the algorithm is applied on the classes of the previous classification, to obtain the next one, at the more permissive threshold. Consequently, a hierarchical organization of all proteins is obtained. The resulting classification splits the space of all protein sequences into well defined groups of proteins. The results show that the automatically induced sets of proteins are closely correlated with natural biological families and super families. The hierarchical organization reveals finer sub-families that make up known families of proteins as well as many interesting relations between protein families. The hierarchical organization proposed may be considered as the first map of the space of all protein sequences. An interactive web site including the results of our analysis has been constructed, and is now accessible through http://www.protomap.cs.huji.ac.il

The underlying assumption in calculating these parameters is that the amino acid composition of the query sequence is close to the overall distribution. This assumption often fails, e.g. for low complexity segments.

Reference-contexts: The thresholds 3 The differences between FASTA and SW are mostly due to the different scoring matrices that are being used, and can be corrected by multiplying the original score by the relative entropy of the two matrices <ref> (Altschul 1991) </ref>. The differences between SW and BLAST may be due to approximations in estimating the parameters and K (Karlin and Altschul 1990). The underlying assumption in calculating these parameters is that the amino acid composition of the query sequence is close to the overall distribution.

Reference-contexts: To compute the weight of the directed edge from A to B, one compares A against all sequences in the SWISSPROT database, and obtains a distribution of scores. The weight is taken as the expectation value <ref> (Altschul et al. 1994) </ref> of the similarity score between A and B, based on this distribution. This is a statistical estimate for the number of occurrences of the appropriate score at a random setup, assuming the existing amino acid composition. A high expectation value entails a weak connection. <p> Therefore we chose to incorporate all three methods into our graph, to achieve maximum sensitivity 2 . An unusual amino acid composition of the query sequence may strongly bias the results of a search. A case in point are the effects of low complexity segments within sequences <ref> (Altschul et al. 1994) </ref>. Therefore, we also consulted the results of BLAST following a filtering of the query sequence, to exclude low complexity segments, using the SEG program (Wooton and Federhen 1993). The following sections contain a detailed description of the procedure of assigning weights to edges.

Reference-contexts: Though the common evolutionary origin of two proteins is almost never directly observed, we can deduce homology among proteins, with a high statistical confidence, given that the sequence similarity is significant. This is particularly useful in the so called "twilight zone" <ref> (Doolittle 1992) </ref>, where sequences are identical to, say, 10-25%. Transitivity can be used to detect related proteins, beyond the power of a direct search. The potential value of transitivity has been observed before.

Many similarities were reported exclusively by only a single method - in some cases as many as tens of hits per sequence, which were not detected by the other methods.

Reference-contexts: Transitivity can be used to detect related proteins, beyond the power of a direct search. The potential value of transitivity has been observed before. In (Watanabe and Otsuka 1995) transitivity and single linkage clustering are employed to extract similarities among 2000 E. coli protein sequences. In <ref> (Koonin et al. 1996) </ref> a similar analysis is performed on 75% of the proteins encoded in the E. coli genome. The power of transitivity in inferring homology among distantly related proteins (e.g., Streptomyces griseus protease A and protease B) is demonstrated in (Pearson 1997).

Reference-contexts: It participates in the regulation of cellular metabolism, survival and differentiation. In the last decade many additional proteins that are related to ras were discovered. They all share the guanine nucleotide binding site and are of 21-30 KDa in length. They are referred to as the small-G-protein super-family <ref> (Nuoffer and Balch 1994) </ref>. This family of proteins has several sub-families: ras, rab, ran, rho, ral, and smaller sub-families. Like to ras, these proteins participate in cell regulation processes, such as vesicle trafficking (rab) and cytoskele-ton organization (rho).

Therefore, we ignore those BLAST scores that come from a large number of HSPs (high scoring pairs), whereas the MSP (maximal segment pair) is insignificant 6 .

Reference-contexts: Detecting homology may often help in determining the function of new proteins. By definition, homologous proteins evolved from the same ancestor protein. The degree of conservation varies among protein families. However, homologous proteins almost always have the same fold <ref> (Pearson 1996) </ref>. Homology is, by definition, a transitive relation: If A is homologous to B, and B is homologous to C, then A is homologous to C. This simple observation can be very effective in discovering homology. However, when applied simple-mindedly, this observation may also lead to many pitfalls.

A major difference between BLAST and SW/FASTA is that BLAST does not allow gaps 5 and therefore tends 4 While the self-normalized statistical estimates of FASTA and SW <ref> (Pearson 1998) </ref> are quite reliable, the statistical estimates of BLAST may be biased for low complexity sequences (see previous footnote). Consequently, filtering may significantly reduce the number of high scoring hits reported by BLAST.

Reference-contexts: Many sequences that are added to the databases are unannotated and await analysis. Currently, 12 complete genomes (of yeast, E. coli, and other bacteria) are available. Between 35%-50% of their proteins have an unknown function <ref> (Pennisi 1997) </ref>. In the absence of structural data, analysis necessarily starts by investigating the sequence proper. Sequence analysis has many aspects: composition, hydrophobicity, charge, secondary structure propensity and more. The most effective analyses compare the sequence under study with the whole database, in search for close relatives.

Reference-contexts: The distribution drawn in a log-log scale is nearly linear at low expectation values, but starts a rapid increase at a certain value. The slope may be viewed as a measure for the geometric entropy ( ~ = dimensionality) of neighboring sequences <ref> (Pisier 1989) </ref>. The mild slope at low expectation values indicates a low entropy at the short range which seems fairly uniform throughout the space. The steep slope indicates a rapid growth in the number of sequences that are unrelated to the centering sequence (high expectation values).
