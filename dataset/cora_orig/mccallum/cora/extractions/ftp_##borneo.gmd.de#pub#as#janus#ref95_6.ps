Reference-contexts: Unfortunately it is not possible to use the results of this paper to make positive mathematically based suggestions of how to construct intelligent approximators. However some definable cases have been examined where any kind of research in this area is clearly meaningless. We notice that other recent reports <ref> [1, 2] </ref> partly investigate the same issue, from an automata theory perspective [1] and a probabilistically founded viewpoint [2].
