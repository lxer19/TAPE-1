Abstract: In our earlier paper, we presented a method of obtaining partial and relaxed metrics from co-continuous and bi-continuous valuations for any continuous Scott domain A via formalism of Info-structures. Certain pathologies in the behavior of I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg precluded us from extending this method beyond bounded complete domains. In this paper, we obtain meaningful Scott continuous relaxed metrics for continuous dcpo's by replacing I x with Neginfo(x) = Int(J x ), where J x = fy 2 A j x 2 Int(I y )g. This result can be understood in terms of interplay between negation duality and Stone duality. This technique works especially well, when a continuous dcpo A satisfies the Lawson condition | the relative Scott and Lawson topologies on Total(A) are equal. We obtain that the Lawson condition is equivalent to the property 8x 2 Total(A): I x = J x . This implies that when the Lawson condition holds, an induced metric on Total(A) results.
