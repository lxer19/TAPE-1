Title: Semantic Cardinality Estimation for Queries over Objects  
Author: Marian H. Nodine, Mitch Cherniack, Mark H. Nodine 
Keyword: Query optimization, cardinality estimation, cost models, query algebras  
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of estimating cardinalities of queries over sets of objects. We base our estimates on a knowledge of subset relationships between sets (e.g., Students form a subset of People). Previous work on cardinality estimation has assumed that every subset is a representative sample of the set it is taken from. We maintain (o*ine) information for the cases where the subset is not a uniform representative, and use this information to improve the accuracy of our cardinality estimates. We present cardinality estimation techniques for image sets and select sets. Image sets are created by applying a function to an existing set. Select sets contain the elements that satisfy some predicate in an existing set. Empirically we show that we can obtain estimates within a factor of four for reasonable image sets on our test database while maintaining o*ine statistics requiring space linear in the number of named sets in the database and the number of attributes defined per type. We also present an approach for estimating cardinalities of select sets. Our approach is orthogonal to statistical sampling approaches that give a more accurate estimation of the distribution of values an attribute can take in a set, but do not deal with semantically meaningful subsets whose attributes may not have the same distribution.

Reference-contexts: Statistical sampling and related techniques are frequently proposed for approximating selectivity and pro-jectivity where the uniform distribution assumption is violated. Such approaches include Hou et.al. [HOD91], Lipton et.al. [LNS90], Haas and Swami [HS92], and Haas et.al <ref> [HNSS95] </ref>. Histogram techniques [PC84] are also used to improve selectivity estimates. Initial results combining statistical sampling techniques with our semantic estimation techniques is promising. As an alternative to sampling, Sun et.al. use a regression model to approximate the underlying distribution of the data [SLRD93].

Reference-contexts: They assume that a subset is representative of its superset, and thus maintains the same data distributions. With respect to optimization of queries over objects, little work has been done on cost and size modeling. At the query level, we only know of the work by Kemper and Moerkotte <ref> [KM90] </ref>, which uses access support relations to derive sizes and cost of path expressions. 7 Conclusions This paper addresses the problem of estimating cardinalities in persistent object bases. We observed that persistent object bases maintain natural set-subset relationships among the type extents of the types in the type hierarchy.

System R <ref> [SAC + 79] </ref> estimates selectivities for relational select, project and join operations using available indices. Where indices are not present, they use an arbitrary constant fraction. We instead use projectivities (which we can always approximate) to estimate selectivities of arbitrary path expressions.
