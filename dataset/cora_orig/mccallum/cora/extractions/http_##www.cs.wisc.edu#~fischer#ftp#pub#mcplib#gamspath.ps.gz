Title: The PATH solver for Complementarity Problems  
Author: Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris 
Date: May 25, 1994  
Abstract: This document describes the path following nonmonotone stabilization algorithm employed by the PATH solver for complementarity problems. Some implementation details are given as well, along with a description of the available options. For a more complete description, see [1].

Reference-contexts: A number of options exist to control the basis handling routines and the amount of memory they are allocated for factoring and updating the basis. A DEVEX-type routine (see <ref> [3] </ref>) is used to calculate the leaving variable in each pivot operation. The slack tolerance used in this calculation is one of several zero tolerances used by the PATH solver.

Reference-contexts: In the sequel, we shall assume that the function F is continuously differentiable on the box B := [`; u]. In order to apply a damped Newton method, we must rewrite MCP as a zero-finding problem. This is accomplished by using the normal equations (NE) of Robinson <ref> [5] </ref>, defined as 0 = F B (x) := F (x B ) + (x x B ); where x B is the Euclidean projection of x onto the box B. A vector x solves (NE) only if z = x B solves MCP.
