Abstract: M.I.T. Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 475 Appears in Proceedings of the XII Colloquium on Musical Informatics, Gorizia, Italy, September 1998 Abstract The Conductors Jacket is a wearable physiological monitoring system that has been built into the clothing of an orchestral conductor; it was designed to provide a testbed for the study of emotional expression as it relates to musical performance. We used the Conductors Jacket to gather and analyze data from a professional conductor in Boston during rehearsals of Prokofievs Romeo and Juliet Suite No.2. Our findings indicate that several forms of expressive communication can be measured and detected in physiological signals. These include the use of handedness to emphasize musical changes, the signaling of upcoming events with sudden changes in effort, the difference between information-bearing and noninformation-bearing gestures, the indication of intensity and loudness with changes in muscular force, and the use of breathing to express phrasing in the music.
