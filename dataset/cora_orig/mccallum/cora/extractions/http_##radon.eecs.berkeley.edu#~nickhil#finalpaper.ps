Abstract: New metrology for characterizing chemically amplified resist is needed in order to meet the stringent demands of the DUV lithographic technologies. In this paper, we present a general model for DUV resist optical constants. In this model, we assume that the photoresist is homogeneous and can be decomposed into several components according to their distinct and signatures over a broad range of wavelengths. Each component is described by a Kramers-Kronig based dispersion relation. A global optimization with about 18 parameters is solved for the optical thin-film decomposition, using an intelligent simulated annealing algorithm. Various de-noising techniques that can be used on the collected data are also described.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 a shows the signal measured by a state-of-art spectroscopic ellipsometer 2 . The relatively large noise level introduced at the shorter wavelengths by the spectrophotometer can seriously damage further analysis. Modern metrology equipment places more emphasis at the UV range, as shown in <ref> [1] </ref>. Wavelet shrinkage can be viewed as a nonparametric regression problem. The objective is to estimate an unknown signal from the noisy data . Suppose the measured values can be described by (2) where is a actual value and is an independently, normally and identically distributed random error, . <p> Suppose the measured values can be described by (2) where is a actual value and is an independently, normally and identically distributed random error, .

Donoho <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a nonparametric method for reconstructing an unknown function from noisy data by wavelet shrinkage.

Reference-contexts: Both and depend on the wavelength of light, , and therefore on the photon energy, , according to . A model proposed by Forouhi and Bloomer (F&B) has received considerable attention during the last ten years <ref> [3] </ref>. This model starts with a derived expression for the extinction coefficient, and the refractive index is obtained from the extinction coefficient using Kramers-Kronig integration.

Reference-contexts: A characteristic of the F-B equations is their simplicity. F&B equations have been used for amorphous and polycrystalline solid thin-films. McGahan and Woollam presented a modification to the F&B formulations <ref> [4] </ref>. Jellison and Modine gave another formulation of the optical functions in the inter-band region [5]. However, these parameterization formulations are derived only for inter-band transitions. We consider them as approximate formulations for optical property description of polymer thin-films.
