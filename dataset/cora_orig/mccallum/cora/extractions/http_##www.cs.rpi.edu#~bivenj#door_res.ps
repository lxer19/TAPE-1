Abstract: As networks grow larger and more complicated, their management also becomes more difficult, especially when there is no central authority to coordinate management. In many cases, management efforts have imposed a great deal of traffic on the network, causing noticeable delays by network users. The realistic scalability of these systems is also a problem in most management applications. When the management tasks change, every node running the management application must be updated. Many large research efforts are underway in the area of proactive network problem avoidance. However, many of these techniques require the use of a large amount of current and historical network data. These same techniques also perform many calculations and build models based on this data. Using active agents and distributed technologies, these problems can be eliminated and a foundation for supporting proactive network problem avoidance can be established. This paper describes a distributed object, agent based framework for facilitating management of large networks. This framework serves as a middleware between a collection of independent network management agents and network nodes. This work is done with a network problem avoidance group at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to provide network data in a non-intrusive, reliable manner.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, all locations were relatively close. We feel our implementation would display its full potential in a more expansive environment. 6 Related Work Bauer et al. use a repository for management of distributed applications in the MANDAS (Management of Distributed Applications and Systems) project <ref> [2] </ref>. This paper concentrates on an area other than network management, but there are many similarities with their work and ours. They use a Management Information Repository (MIR) to hold information about their distributed applications. However, they have only one centralized repository.

Reference-contexts: However, they have only one centralized repository. Our implementation will use distributed repositories with advanced communication methods for transferring data between the repositories. Harista et al. describe MANDATE (MAnaging Networks Using DAtabase TEchnology), which is a proposed MIB (Management Information Base) to support network management <ref> [3] </ref>. They propose to have operators interact solely with their MIB for network management. Their MIB holds information about the network, similar to our network of repositories. Implementation of MANDATE is client-server based with sophisticated client caching.

Reference-contexts: When a repository is caching data from other repositories for its clients, it should use the same consistency model used for clients requesting data from repositories. Different types of consistency models are outlined in <ref> [6] </ref>. For example, if the client requests a temporal update of data (client should receive updates every x units of time), then the repository should request the same type of updates from the repository sending the data.
