Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of a fluid queue with a buffer content that varies linearly during periods that are governed by a three-state semi-Markov process. Two cases are being distinguished: (i) two upward slopes and one downward slope, and (ii) one upward slope and two downward slopes. In both cases, at least one of the period distributions is allowed to be completely general. We obtain exact results for the buffer content distribution, the busy period distribution and the distribution of the maximal buffer content during a busy period. The results are obtained by establishing relations between the fluid queues and ordinary queues with instantaneous input, and by using level crossing theory.

Reference-contexts: Cohen [9] considered the case of identical sources, with general on-period distribution. Rubinovitch [25] (N identical sources) and Kaspi and Rubinovitch [14] (N non-identical sources) were mainly concerned with the busy period distribution. The interest in fluid queues was renewed by the fundamental paper of An-ick, Mitra and Sondhi <ref> [2] </ref>. It considers N on/off sources with exponentially distributed on- and off-periods. Similar to Kosten's work, the joint equilibrium distribution of the buffer content and the number of busy sources in [2] is described by a set of differential equations. <p> The interest in fluid queues was renewed by the fundamental paper of An-ick, Mitra and Sondhi <ref> [2] </ref>.

Our model is related to that of Anick et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. They do not restrict themselves to the case in which the state space of J has only three states; on the other hand, in their model the times between transitions are all exponential, so that (X; J ) is a Markov process.

Reference-contexts: Here V NF and V E are random variables with distribution the limiting distribution of V NF (t) and V E (t), respectively. Since L NF (t) is a Levy process, one can identify the law of sup 0t&lt;1 L NF (t) with that of V NF <ref> [3] </ref>.

Agreement of the first and last term follows from (6.1) and [11], p. 618. Agreement of the two representations is also easily shown by using Formula (II.5.110) on p. 297 of [11]). Remark 6.1.

Reference-contexts: By subsequently applying the reflection map we obtain the workload process of a certain queueing model which we call the M=G U =G D =1 queue. G U and G D , respectively, refer to upward and downward jumps. This queueing model has been analyzed in <ref> [4] </ref>. It is an M=G=1-type queue with the extra feature that, according to a Poisson process, stochastic amounts of work are removed from the system. <p> Here V NF and V E are random variables with distribution the limiting distribution of V NF (t) and V E (t), respectively. Since L NF (t) is a Levy process, one can identify the law of sup 0t&lt;1 L NF (t) with that of V NF [3]. In <ref> [4] </ref> it is shown that the limiting distribution of V NF (t) is equal to the steady-state distribution of the actual waiting time of a certain GI=G=1 11 queue. <p> Let S e be a random variable that is independent of V NF , with as distribution the equilibrium distribution of S. Then V NF + S e ' W GI=G=1 + S e ' V E : Here the first equality follows from <ref> [4] </ref>, the second from p. 296 of [11], and the third by time reversal. Remark 4.1 Below we sketch a different proof of Lemma 4.1. <p> densities f NF (x) and f E (x) of V NF and V E for x &gt; 0, LCT leads as in (3.6) to: (x) = (1 b 1 a )f E (x)P a ; x &gt; 0: (4.2) Finally, (x) follows from known results for f NF (x) in <ref> [4] </ref> and Lemma 4.1. 5 Busy period analysis In this section we present a method for determining the busy period distribution for a class of fluid queues with one negative slope. We then apply that method to the model of Case (i). <p> The probabilities p and q are easily determined. 18 Furthermore, the distribution of V NF is known, cf. <ref> [4] </ref> where the case of generally distributed downward jumps is treated. Obviously, P (X max x) = P (V max where V max NF is the maximum of the workload during one busy period of the process fV NF (t); t 0g. <p> This happens for three, real, values: For ! 0 = 0 and for 1 [ 0 + + 0 ( 0 + + 0 ) 2 + 4 ( + 0 0 )]: The stability condition 0 = &lt; 1 + 0 = (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>) guarantees that ! 1 and ! 2 are real. Substitution of ! = ! 0 ; ! 1 ,! 2 in (7.10) yields three equations which just suffice to determine the three unknowns OE x (s), OE 0 (s) and OE (s).

Reference-contexts: The Z j represent the lengths of successive a-periods. By applying the reflection map we obtain that V E (t) is the so-called elapsed waiting time process (EWT) of a certain GI=G=1 queue (cf. <ref> [22] </ref>). The subscript E designates "elapsed". The EWT is the time elapsed since the arrival of the customer in service. Note that under this interpretation the system is with probability 1 never empty, since the idle periods are deleted. <p> Now reverse time. Departures and arrivals are reversed so that interarrival times become interdeparture times and vice versa. This technique is used to construct the EWT from the work process.
