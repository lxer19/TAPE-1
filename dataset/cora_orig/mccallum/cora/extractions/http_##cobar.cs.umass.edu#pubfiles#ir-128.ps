Title: Event Tracking

Abstract: This paper introduces Event Tracking, a new application of Information Retrieval technology with interesting research and evaluation questions. We describe the problem, a pilot corpus of news stories that was constructed for experimental studies, and a "rolling" evaluation strategy that uses different segments of the corpus for each query. As part of a preliminary evaluation on a small pilot study corpus, we show that simple feature extraction methods can generate moderately accurate event representations, but that some classes of events are handled much better by letting the representation adapt to the event's evolution in the news. Event tracking is part of the Topic Detection and Tracking initiative.

Reference-contexts: Event Tracking requires finding stories that discuss an event that may not match any already known class of events. Because it connects stories together by the driving event, Event Tracking shares some similarities with automatic hypertext creation. There has been work on making such links in a general setting <ref> [3] </ref> and in electronic mail [13], but that work did not touch upon events. Some recent work that associates news photographs with stories about the picture [6] is very similar in spirit to Event Tracking.

As we will do in our work, they represented stories and photo captions by sets of features.

Reference-contexts: An ideal system might output a score that corresponds to the probability that the story discusses the event; ideal systems do not exist. In this work, we skirt the threshold issue by using a Detection Error Tradeoff curve <ref> [14] </ref> to show how false alarm and miss rates vary with respect to each other at various threshold values. Figure 1 shows examples of DET plots showing curves for several different runs.

Reference-contexts: of times the feature occurs in the story, df i is the total number of the times the feature occurs in the collection, and N is the number of stories in the collection. (This weighting function is a simplification of the more complex 4 weighting scheme currently used in InQuery <ref> [21] </ref>; it assumes that all stories are of roughly the same length, that the collection is never empty, and that df i is not zero.) In order that the tracking system model a real setting, the "collection" information cannot be known in advance.

Reference-contexts: The second ("past") adds some additional training data to the start of the corpus so that "collection" statistics such as idf are more likely to be meaningful. We represent stories by vectors of features. The features were found by applying a shallow tagger <ref> [22] </ref> to the stories and selecting all nouns, verbs, adjectives, and numbers. Names of countries, states, and large cities were treated as single features by the tagger even if they are multiword. There was no stopword list, but most common stopwords do not fall into the parts of speech used.
