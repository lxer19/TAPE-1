Reference-contexts: The non-convergence problem is serious because as is well known <ref> (see Ansorge, 1990, for example) </ref> the LWR model usually has multiple solutions but only one that is physically relevant. Numerical methods must not only approximate the partial differential equations of the LWR theory but they must also identify automatically the proper solution.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, such improvements do not guarantee convergence; a symptom of non-convergence is that stopped traffic is still predicted not to flow into an empty freeway. For higher order models, alternative formulations which include downstream information have been proposed but they still require heuristic protections against unreasonable results <ref> (Cremer et al, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: APPLICATIONS AND COMMENTS The previous section assumed that the desired route between each origin and destination was known for all times. Thus, we were able to define turn constants Id (t) for every downstream cell of a diverge. This is reasonable if we assume <ref> (as in Horowitz, 1984) </ref> that drivers respond to some weighted average of their past driving experiences and that such experiences determine the turn constants. The network model described in this paper could then be used to simulate a sequence of days to see if an equilibrium is reached.

Reference-contexts: Because the dynamics of higher order models have not been properly linked to any model of sensible driver behavior as has been done for the LWR model <ref> (Newell, 1961) </ref> and because said models have been shown to exhibit undesirable properties (del Castillo et al, 1993), this paper will focus on the LWR model.

Reference-contexts: Such approaches dont converge to the desired solution and cannot produce reasonable results <ref> (Newell, 1988) </ref> 3 ; obviously, traffic could be sent into a section even after it reaches its maximum occupancy.

Res. </journal> <volume> 27B (4), </volume> <pages> 281-314. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Laxs method converges to the physically relevant LWR solution but uses a procedure where vehicles dont always move forward; this may limit its practical appeal. Lukes method is computationally demanding but it can be streamlined in an important special case <ref> (Newell, 1993) </ref>; with Newells method solutions can be easily obtained by hand. Newell (1993) also describes a procedure for handling a single freeway. The finite difference procedure in Daganzo (1993b) applies to the special case considered in Newell (1993). <p> These three quantities are still given by equations (3). Because part of S Bk (t) is destined for Ek and part for Ck, it will be assumed <ref> (as in Newell, 1993) </ref> that all the flow is restricted if either one of the diverging branches is unable to accommodate its allocation of flow. This assumes that vehicles unable to exit prevent all those behind, regardless of destination, to continue.

These equations are used in an approximation procedure for networks, where it is assumed that the turning percentages at every diverge are given.

Reference-contexts: model indicate, to not great surprise, that driver advisories should anticipate the projected evolution of the system, Daganzo and Lin, 1993a.) Dynamic network models can also be applied to evaluate the performance of emergency evacuation plans developed in response to the possibility of a disaster such as a nuclear meltdown <ref> (Sheffi et al, 1982) </ref>. Because in such an instance time is of the essence, a realistic model of network performance under a dynamic load is necessary.
