Title: Exploiting Regularity for Low-Power Design  
Author: Renu Mehra and Jan Rabaey

Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California,  
Abstract: Current day behavioral-synthesis techniques produce architectures that are power-inefficient in the interconnect. Experiments have demonstrated that in synthesized designs, about 10 to 40% of the total power may be dissipated in buses, multiplexors, and drivers. We present a novel approach targeted at the reduction of power dissipation in interconnect elements buses, multiplexors, and buffers. The scheduling, assignment, and allocation techniques presented in this paper exploit the regularity and common computational patterns in the algorithm to reduce the fan-outs and fan-ins of the interconnect wires, resulting in reduced bus capacitances and a simplified interconnect structure. Average power savings of 47% and 49% in buses and multiplexors, respectively, are demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples.

Reference-contexts: The importance of targeting interconnect power reduction at the architecture level is highlighted by the following two facts (i) interconnect components may consume a large percentage of the total power and (ii) their power consumption is highly dependent on architecture-level design decisions <ref> [1] </ref>. We provide an scheduling, assignment, and allocation strategy specifically aimed at reducing interconnect power . We target ASIC implementations of datapath-intensive, real-time DSP applications with fixed throughput constraints. <p> However, none of these have tar geted power reduction they reduce the number of buses but ignore the cost of accessing them. Techniques for interconnect power optimization by exploiting the locality of the algorithm are presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. The approach in that work is complementary to, and can potentially be used in combination with, the current approach.

A similar idea to reduce interconnections during assignment for pipelined datapaths is given in <ref> [4] </ref> where the authors consider assignment of paths (not Etemplates) and propose a technique different from ours. Using E-templates as opposed to larger patterns for exploiting regularity has the advantage that, while detecting and matching generic patterns is NP-complete, these operations take linear time for Etemplates.

Reference-contexts: Our results indicate that large power savings can be achieved with the Etemplate based approach. Sections 3 and 4 present the details of our scheduling and assignment-allocation techniques based on this approach. 3. E-template-based scheduling Our scheduling approach derives from the forcedirected scheduling technique first proposed by Paulin <ref> [9] </ref>. For a detailed description of the algorithm we refer readers to that paper, here we limit the discussion to its effect on assignment regularity. Consider an example with two E-templates, E1 and E2, with four and two instances, respectively , as shown in Fig. 3 (a).

Reference-contexts: We derive the maximum independent set using a popular greedy heuristic that has been shown to give good results <ref> [10] </ref>. This algorithm is modified to bias it towards choosing the more favorable candidate in case of a tie. 4.3 E-template based assignment strategy Our assignment-allocation scheme is divided into two phases. We start by detecting all the E-templates in the given graph and calculating their coverages.

Reference-contexts: In each iteration, therefore, Etemplates whose coverages fall below a certain threshold are eliminated. When all the Etemplates are eliminated, the f irst phase terminates and the remaining nodes are colored using a vertex coloring technique <ref> [11] </ref>. A pseudo code for the assignment and allocation algorithm is given in Fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: Interconnect models The power savings in our synthesis strategy stem from the reduction of power consumed in buses and multiplexors and it is important to estimate the power consumed by these components in order to validate our synthesis strategy. We used SPA, an architectural power analysis tool <ref> [12] </ref>, for our estimations. The power consumed by buses depends on the length of buses which is difficult to estimate before placement and routing. In order to analyze the ef fect of the synthesis technique on power, we first present a model for the estimating bus lengths.

Reference-contexts: In order to analyze the ef fect of the synthesis technique on power, we first present a model for the estimating bus lengths. The model has been validated using layouts. At the gate level, wire lengths are modeled as being directly proportional to the fanout of the wire <ref> [13] </ref> but this ef fect is largely ignored in architecture-level models [14, 15]. Examining several designs we found that the linear relationship holds even at the high level. The length of any bus, i, is estimated as L pp times its fanout, F i , as given in Equation 1.

A set of 15 examples, consisting of different structures of FIR filters, IIR filters and transforms were selected for experimentation.
