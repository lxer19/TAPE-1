Abstract: This article describes a numerical method that may be used to efficiently locate and track underwater sonar targets in the near-field, with both bearing and range estimation, for the case of very large passive arrays. The approach used has no requirement for a priori knowledge about the source and uses only limited information about the receiver array shape. The role of sensor position uncertainty and the consequence of targets always being in the near-field are analysed and the problems associated with the manipulation of large matrices inherent in conventional eigenvalue type algorithms noted. A simpler numerical approach is then presented which reduces the problem to that of search optimization. When using this method the location of a target corresponds to finding the position of the maximum weighted sum of the output from all sensors. Since this search procedure can be dealt with using modern stochastic optimization methods, such as the genetic algorithm, the operational requirement that an acceptable accuracy be achieved in real time can usually be met. The array studied here consists of 225 elements positioned along a flexible cable towed behind a ship with 3.4m between sensors, giving an effective aperture of 761.6m. For such a long array, the far field assumption used in most beam-forming algorithms is no longer appropriate. The waves emitted by the targets then have to be considered as curved rather than plane. It is shown that, for simulated data, if no significant noise

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that the array manifold be stored in the form of a set of vectors, for a grid of DOAs and frequencies spanning the desired field of view and the frequency band of interest <ref> [9] </ref>. However, very little work seems to have been done for the near-field case. Here, for point sources, the 2 wave-front presented to the array is spherical and offers the additional degree of freedom of range variation.

Reference-contexts: Techniques for estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOA) of signals impinging on antenna arrays have been investigated intensively over the years <ref> [10] </ref>. Beam-forming [24] is the most widely used processing technique for these arrays and can be used for direction finding by `steering the beam' until the array output power is maximized (or minimized). The direction at which the power is maximized provides an estimate of the source bearing.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is also normal to assume that the array transducer positions are known with complete accuracy. In these circumstances eigen-decomposition high resolution methods <ref> [11] </ref> have proven to be effective means of obtaining bearing estimates of far-field narrow-band sources from noisy measurements. The performance of these algorithms is, in general, severely degraded when the target is in the near-field or there is uncertainty in the transducer positions.

Reference-contexts: The problem posed here is, however, at most only a four dimensional search and thus amenable to optimization methods.

They work by maintaining a pool or population of competing estimates which are combined to find improved solutions. In their basic form, each member of the population is represented by a binary string that encodes the variables characterizing the solution.

Reference-contexts: to resolve target bearings without the spatial ambiguity inherent in processing the data from straight arrays. 6 ARRAY SHAPE MODELLING Because of the problems inherent in processing data when the sensor positions are unknown, it is normal when building long flexible arrays to incorporate shape estimation instrumentation within the array <ref> [16] </ref>. Typically, compasses are positioned along the array and these may then be used to estimate its shape at any instant. Of course, such compass data is never precisely accurate and noise in this data must also be considered.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, antenna arrays need to be calibrated to produce reliable DOA estimates. During the calibration process, the array response vector (also called the array manifold) is measured and stored, for a finite number of directions <ref> [18] </ref>. This response description depends on the amplitude and phase weighting of the signals from each element or sensor of the array and the positions of the elements within the array structure.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it should be noted that the four variable search/power optimization problem being solved here is by no means trivial. As will be seen in the next section, attempts to locate the targets using classical, slope ascent methods <ref> [23] </ref> consistently fail to find adequate solutions. No doubt this is due to the extreme sensitivity of the array power to the bearing selection and also the noisy nature of the data (which means that the function being optimized is not uni-modal or smooth). <p> Optimization techniques have been studied for very many years and over that time a considerable number of methods have been proposed. A number of authors have collated these methods into libraries allowing comparison to be made between them <ref> [23] </ref>, [22], [12]; the last of these libraries, called OPTIONS, is used here.

Reference-contexts: Techniques for estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOA) of signals impinging on antenna arrays have been investigated intensively over the years [10]. Beam-forming <ref> [24] </ref> is the most widely used processing technique for these arrays and can be used for direction finding by `steering the beam' until the array output power is maximized (or minimized). The direction at which the power is maximized provides an estimate of the source bearing.
