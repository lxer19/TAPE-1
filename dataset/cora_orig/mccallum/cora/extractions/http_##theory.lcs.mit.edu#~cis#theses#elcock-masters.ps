It would be disastrous if an adversary could gain access to the web server on the user's machine and thus gain access to his SDSI cache, perhaps doing damage or viewing sensitive information. <p> Validity. Certificates may also contain not-before and not-after fields, which specify the validity period of the certificate. More information about these and other aspects of the design of SDSI 2.0 can be found on the SDSI Web Page <ref> [1] </ref>. Developments such as these will require corresponding changes in the SDSI user interface. 65 66 Chapter 7 Conclusion This aim of this thesis was to provide a prototype implementation of a graphical user interface for SDSI.

Reference-contexts: The SDSI proposal [8] (Sept., 1996) outlines a public-key certification scheme that is simple and flexible, employing completely local names, and using group definitions for access control. It is described in more detail in Chapter 3. PolicyMaker. Proposed by Blaze, Feigenbaum and Lacy (May, 1996), PolicyMaker <ref> [2] </ref> is not strictly a public-key certificate scheme, but rather provides a generic language for expressing trust relationships, policies and credentials, so that decisions can be made about requests based on digitally signed messages.

Reference-contexts: Most of them move away from the traditional idea of binding 16 a public-key to a particular individual or entity by using that individual's "unique" name. Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI). Proposed by the IETF working group, and in particular, Carl Ellison, SPKI <ref> [3] </ref> is a recent (June, 1996) proposal for a public-key infrastructure. SPKI certificates grant specific authorizations to the subject of a certificate, which is a public-key, rather than an individual or other entity. <p> In particular, the authors of SDSI and SPKI <ref> [3] </ref> are actively discussing a merging of the two schemes, since they possess many similarities. This design is called SPKI/SDSI 2.0. It is also referred to as SPKI 2.0 and SDSI 2.0 This thesis implements SDSI version 1.0, and a new version may require modifications of the user 63 interface.

Reference-contexts: These issues need to be addressed in order to see public-key technologies used to their fullest potential. To date, the development of a wide-spread public-key infrastructure has been very slow. 15 2.3.1 Existing Infrastructures X.509. X.509 certificates <ref> [7] </ref> are the most widely used today. Their use includes the MasterCard/Visa Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) infrastructure for Internet-based bank card payments, the United States Federal Government, and the ICE-TEL initiative in Europe.

Reference-contexts: While there are existing proposals for public key infrastructures, some of which are already used in practice, many of them are complex and inadequate, and to date, the development of a widely used public-key infrastructure has been slow. SDSI (Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure, pronounced "sudsy") <ref> [8] </ref> is a proposal by Ronald Rivest and Butler Lampson that has been recently put forward in an attempt to address some of the problems of existing public-key schemes, as well as present some new ideas for implementing a large-scale public-key infrastructure. <p> An example of such an authorization would be to allow a particular public-key to telnet to a certain host using a particular username. Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI). SDSI is the joint work of Ronald Rivest and Butler Lampson. The SDSI proposal <ref> [8] </ref> (Sept., 1996) outlines a public-key certification scheme that is simple and flexible, employing completely local names, and using group definitions for access control. It is described in more detail in Chapter 3. PolicyMaker. <p> She can define the group using the SDSI UI. The SDSI UI should enable Alice (or any other user) to perform all of the functions listed above, as well as the other basic SDSI functions described in the SDSI proposal <ref> [8] </ref>. In addition, the UI should be simple and easy to use, and should provide the user with ample on-line support. <p> However, group certificates are changed extensively in the next version of SDSI, which is outlined in Section 6.3. Images. SDSI certificates may include images, however support for this was not included in either the SDSI shell or the UI. Standard root support. The SDSI proposal <ref> [8] </ref> describes certain principals that are likely to become "standard roots". In addition, DNS Internet email names are given special status. Explicit support for this was not included in the UI. Text fragment searching. Users can currently search for certificates by inputting names, such as bob-jones. <p> For membership certificates, this default is (ACL: (member: ALL!)), and for name/value and auto-certificates, it is (ACL: (read: ALL! )) (note that this is actually a departure from what was outlined in the SDSI paper <ref> [8] </ref>). An improvement would be to give the user the flexibility to specify other ACLs for the certificates that he signs. Membership Queries. Membership queries were not fully implemented in the user interface or the SDSI shell. 62 Membership Certs.

Reference-contexts: However, the recent X.509 version 3 standard allows the use of other local names in certificates, mainly out of a realization that the DN naming scheme was too constraining. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). Philip Zimmermann's PGP <ref> [10] </ref> is popular among Internet users for encrypting and signing email. Each user chooses a name for his public-key, which is usually his full name followed by an email address, such as Bob M. Jones &lt;bob@abc.com&gt;.
