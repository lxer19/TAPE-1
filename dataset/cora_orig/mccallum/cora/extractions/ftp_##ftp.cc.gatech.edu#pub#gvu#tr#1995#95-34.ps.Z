Abstract: While the growth and variety of Internet information systems has been dramatic over the past five years, the methodical consideration of the differences between systems has not been emphasized. We present a particular scenario-based method for analyzing different systems in this domain based on their software architecture. We demonstrate this method, the Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM), by applying it to three well-known Internet information systemsWWW, WAIS and Harvest.

Reference-contexts: scenario interaction for this case study, but in Section 6, we will discuss the conclusions on this case study before discussing in Section 7 our conclusions concerning the importance of this method for analyzing architectural variants in the IIS domain in general. 2 Overview of SAMM Our previous work ([15], <ref> [6] </ref>, [16]) was motivated by frequent claims in the literature of how a particular system satisfied non-functional qualities (modifiability, scalability, security, etc.) without any validation of those claims. <p> sends a request to the server, the Search Engine checks access privileges and retrieves the file if access by the client is allowed, compresses the data and writes it to stream. 4.3 Harvest Harvest is a resource discovery tool which leverages off of much of the functionality of the Web <ref> [6] </ref>. Unlike the Web, it attempts to provide mechanisms to facilitate global resource discovery amongst heterog-enous Internet based services like FTP, Gopher, UseNet News, & the WWW.

Reference-contexts: This list is in no way complete, nor do we even claim that it represents the most important concerns of the IIS community. There has been activity in the IIS community to document scenarios (see, for example, the draft report on URC scenarios <ref> [10] </ref>), and that activity would be the best input for improving the relevance of this SAAM analysis.

Reference-contexts: Schwartz et al. do the comparison by means of how systems differ on the general characteristics for data and metadata. Our comparison will be based on much less general characteristics, but will be performed on more consistent and formal system descriptions. Obraczka, Danzig and Li <ref> [18] </ref> provide another taxonomic approach to describing 11 different IISs across 8 different characteristics. Their taxonomy extends that of Schwartz et al. with the addition of four yes/no characteristics (query, browse, organize, directory of services) that are used to determine if an IIS provides some capability or service.

Reference-contexts: Given the importance and virtual ubiquity of these systems, it is natural to want to compare and contrast them. Some researchers have provided overviews and comparisons of the various IISs. We will briefly review some of that previous work. Schwartz et al. <ref> [20] </ref> provided an early taxonomy of resource discovery tools. They provided a textual description of nine different IISs and then defined four different characteristics (granularity, distribution, interconnection topology and data integration scheme) that are used to classify how a given IIS handles both data and metadata.
