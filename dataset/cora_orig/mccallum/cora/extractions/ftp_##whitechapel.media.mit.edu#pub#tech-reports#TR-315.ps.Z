Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 315 Submitted: ICCV '95 Abstract Recent progress in motion analysis has been achieved with systems that estimate global parameterized motion by integrating multiple constraints. The success of these approaches depends critically on the ability to segment constraints derived from different motions. Hence the problems of motion estimation and segmentation are tightly coupled. We believe it is impossible to solve these problems solely in the motion domain, and that mechanisms of spatial form analysis must be incorporated into the motion estimation procedure. We present a new framework which allows the incorporation of form information in a graceful manner. It combines concepts from perceptual organization with the powerful optimization technique of EM. We show that the algorithm is guaranteed to decrease a cost function at every iteration, and that in the absence of form information the cost function reduces to the one minimized by EM. We demonstrate that the approach can achieve good motion estimation and segmentation with challenging motion sequences. Recent progress in motion analysis has been achieved with systems that estimate global parameterized motion [Black and Jepson, 1994, Wang and Adelson, 1994, Hsu et al., 1994, Bergen et al., 1992] These methods have advantages over local optic flow in that they overcome the local ill-posedness of the motion estimation problem by integrating multiple constraints. The sucess of these approaches, however, depends critically on the ability to segment constraints derived from different motions. Hence the problems of motion estimation and segmentation have become tightly coupled. The joint solution of these problems remains difficult, even for scenes that are very simple. Consider, for example, the scene shown in fig 1(a) (see also [Bergen et al., 1990]). Two bars of different grey shades are moving, one to the left and one to the right. We will consider how several kinds of motion analyses treat this input.

Reference-contexts: In this case the contour is owned by both regions, since it is due to a surface marking rather than to occlusion. We have implemented the POEM algorithm with a rudimentary form of contour ownership. There exist more sophisticated schemes for dealing with perceptual organization <ref> [Nitzberg et al., 1993, Sajda and Finkel, 1994, Williams, 1990] </ref>, but our concern here was to see how well POEM would work when the PO part was quite simple. First, given a static image, we segment it into regions of smooth intensity using a static POEM system.
