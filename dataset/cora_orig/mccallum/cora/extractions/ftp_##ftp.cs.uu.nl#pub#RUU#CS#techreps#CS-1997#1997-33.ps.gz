Abstract: In the field of pattern matching, there is a clear trade-off between effectiveness, accuracy and robustness on one hand and efficiency and simplicity on the other hand. For example, matching patterns more effectively by using a more general class of transformations usually results in a considerable increase of computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce a general pattern matching approach which will be applied to a new measure called the absolute difference. This pattern-similarity measure is affine invariant, which stands out favourably in practical use. The problem of finding a transformation mapping to the minimal absolute difference, like many pattern matching problems, has a high computational complexity. Therefore, we base our algorithm on a hierarchical subdivision of transformation space. The method applies to any affine group of transformations, allowing optimisations for rigid motion. Our implementation of the method performs well in terms of reliability and efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Much work has been done on matching point set patterns without establishing correspondences by means of the Hausdorff distance [12, 11, 16, 9, 8, 22, 19]. Although robust against perturbations, the Hausdorff distance is very sensitive to occlusion and absent or outlying parts. The partial Hausdorff distance <ref> [7, 21] </ref> is a pattern-similarity measure which overcomes this drawback by matching only parts of patterns. As a result, the partial Hausdorff distance is not a metric. More seriously, the distance is dependent on a threshold parameter specifying the minimal fraction of matching points, which must be known a priori.

Reference-contexts: This approach will be most efficient if optimal matches are concentrated within a limited number of small regions in transformation space. Under such circumstances our algorithm will eliminate large subsets of transformation space at an early stage. In <ref> [10] </ref>, we applied our hierarchical minimisation-approach to the partial Hausdorff distance. In the current paper, an algorithm for matching using the absolute difference will be developed. The new algorithm can be used to approximate the minimum absolute difference within any desired accuracy, reporting a near-optimal transformation in the process. <p> This means that must be capable of detecting similar patterns even if parts in one pattern may be absent from the other or lying outside of it. Examples of pattern-similarity measures are the the uniform metric [23] the Frechet distance [13], the Hausdorff distance [16], the partial Hausdorff distance <ref> [21, 10] </ref>, and the symmetric difference [14]. In exact pattern matching algorithms, the discrete metric, defined by A 6= B ) (A; B) = 1, is used implicitly. Each pattern-similarity measure, has a specific pattern space P on which it is defined. <p> Moreover, for the examples involving scaling (tests five to ten), the transformation space for the one-way Hausdorff distance is only half the size of that for the absolute difference, because of the restriction of the scaling. 4.4 Implementation Both the one-way Hausdorff version of our technique, described in <ref> [10] </ref> and the one-way absolute function difference variant described in the current paper were implemented in C++. The implementations use as many of the same libraries and basic data-structures as possible. Both programs were compiled using the the SGI Delta/C++ compiler.
