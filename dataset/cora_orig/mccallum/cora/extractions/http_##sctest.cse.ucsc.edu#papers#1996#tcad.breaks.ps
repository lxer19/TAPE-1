Title: Charge-Based Fault Simulation for CMOS Network Breaks  
Author: Haluk Konuk F. Joel Ferguson Tracy Larrabee 
Abstract: We define a network break as a break fault in the p-network or in the n-network of a CMOS cell that breaks one or more transistor paths between the cell output and Vdd or GND. Previous work, mostly in the context of transistor stuck-open faults, studied test invalidation due to transient paths to Vdd or GND, and due to charge sharing. In this paper we show the importance of Miller feedthrough and feedback capacitances in network break test invalidation, which was ignored by previous work. We present a new fault simulation algorithm for network breaks, with the following novelties: First, the electrical charge coming from Miller and p-n junction capacitances is computed using a transistor charge model [18]; this automatically handles the non-linear nature of transistor capacitances accurately, as opposed to assuming constant capacitance values as was done in previous work. Next, we use only six voltage levels for charge computations, which allows us to create look-up tables that dramatically reduce the computation time. Finally, the maximum voltage an internal node in an n-network can acquire is about three-fourths of the Vdd voltage (instead of Vdd as assumed by previous work), and similarly, a p-network node cannot discharge all the way down to the GND voltage. Using our simulator to analyze test sets for the ISCAS85 circuits, we found that the charge coming from Miller capacitances has a larger share in test invalidation than the charge from p-n junction capacitances. Our simulator spends less time for charge computations than it spends for transient path identification.

Reference-contexts: Detection of a network break with voltage measurements requires a two-vector test. Reddy et al. [15] showed that transient paths to Vdd or GND can invalidate a two-vector test in transistor stuck-open testing, and Barzilai et al. <ref> [1] </ref> showed that charge sharing between the internal nodes of the faulty cell and the high impedance faulty cell output can also invalidate a test. <p> Lee and Breuer [11] proposed a scheme for handling charge sharing in transistor stuck-open fault testing using both I DDQ and voltage measurements, but measuring both current and voltage may not be feasible during testing. Barzilai et al. <ref> [1] </ref> described a fault simulator for transistor stuck-open and stuck-on faults. For handling charge sharing, they partitioned all the nodes in every cell into two classes. Nodes in the first class were assumed to have small enough capacitances so that they could be ignored. <p> Two mechanisms that may invalidate a test, transient paths to Vdd or GND and charge sharing, have been studied in the context of transistor stuck-open faults and CMOS opens by many researchers [15], [8], [21], [3], <ref> [1] </ref>, [11], [4]. In this paper, we show that Miller effects due to the gate-drain and gate-source capacitances of the CMOS transistors can modify the voltage of the faulty cell output when it is at high impedance. <p> Figure 1 shows two cases for an output assignment of 00 and S0 for an AND gate. Other researchers studied the effect of transient paths to Vdd or GND on test invalidation extensively [15], [8], [21], <ref> [1] </ref>, and we now show this effect with an example. Consider the p-network break in Figure 2. The cell input assignments shown form a proposed test for this break.

Reference-contexts: A transistor path is a sequence of transistors physically connected through their drain and source terminals. Note that transistor stuck-open faults form a subset of network break faults. Renovell and Cambon [16], and Champac et al. <ref> [2] </ref> showed that a transistor stuck-open test set can detect some of the breaks that create floating transistor gates. So, a network break test set is useful not only for detecting network breaks but also other breaks that cause floating transistor gates.
