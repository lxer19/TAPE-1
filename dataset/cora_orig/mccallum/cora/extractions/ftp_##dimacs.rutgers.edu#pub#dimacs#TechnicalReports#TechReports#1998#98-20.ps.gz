Reference-contexts: For this model as input rate of cells to a switching system with output rate , the build up of cells at time , in the switchs buffer will be according to (2) (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Thus, using above, it is possible to determine which is the percentage of cells overflowing the buffer size and lost.

Reference-contexts: The resulting problem is naturally hard to solve mathematically to optimum.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the models allow arbitrary paths to be used for the routing, or perhaps a (simple) restricted family of paths, such as limited-length paths. See <ref> [8] </ref> for a more comprehensive recent model.

Reference-contexts: A critical step in generating inequalities (18) or (19) is the choice of the cutset C. Following the work of other researchers, and, in particular, our work in <ref> [12] </ref> and [13], we used an approach that combines some enumeration and also the choice of cutsets that are tight in the current LP-relaxation. Another trick is to maintain a list or cache of cutsets that were used in previous inequalities to test them against the current LP-relaxation.

Reference-contexts: Solution procedure and heuristics The mixed-integer program described in the previous section presents some unique challenges. Network design problems have been extensively studied in the literature (see, for example, [9],[10],[11], [12],[13],[15],[16],[18] and references therein) with good experimental results using cut-and-branch (see <ref> [14] </ref> for mathematical programming basics). However, traditional models tend to stress one particular feature, typically link transmission systems (modeled as edge capacities in an underlying network), or, less frequently, switch capacity (arising as node capacity). <p> In each case the solution of an appropriate linear program yields an inequality of type (19). The reason we use sets and not just cutsets is that this procedure takes into account the survivability features of the model, when present (for a more in-depth look at survivability issues, see <ref> [14] </ref> or [18]). y a F C ( ) 11 This procedure can be surprisingly effective.

Reference-contexts: It is essential to strengthen the formulation with appropriate inequalities. Research on network design algorithms has shown, repeatedly, that cutset inequalities can be fairly effective. See, for example, <ref> [16] </ref>. These inequalities consider a cutset in the underlying network (either a node or edge-cutset) and then make use of the fact that the capacity installed on the cutset has to be large enough to handle the total demand across the cut.

Reference-contexts: The reason we use sets and not just cutsets is that this procedure takes into account the survivability features of the model, when present (for a more in-depth look at survivability issues, see [14] or <ref> [18] </ref>). y a F C ( ) 11 This procedure can be surprisingly effective.

Reference-contexts: Since the capacity variables are integral, an application of the Gomory or MIR procedures <ref> [19] </ref> yields strong inequalities that generally cut-off the continuous solution.

Reference-contexts: However, a careful look at this problem reveals that it has features reminiscent of a set-covering problem. In our approach we have adapted the classical greedy heuristic to our particular problem (see <ref> [21] </ref>). Our implementation of the greedy heuristic essentially discretizes the variables w u and f e . At each iteration, the heuristic chooses one of these variables, corresponding to a demand that is either not yet fulfilled or to a survivability constraint not yet satisfied. <p> One can prove that, under appropriate assumptions, the worst-case behavior of this heuristic is bounded as in <ref> [21] </ref>. 5. Sample data and computations Since performance of optimization algorithms is best measured in the context of real data (as opposed to randomly generated examples), we focus on realistic variations on a real network.

Reference-contexts: We will use a path-based formulation for the underlying multicommodity network flow model. Our experience shows the path-based model is both simpler to solve for realistic networks <ref> [23] </ref> and explicitly allows service-based routing constraints that are almost always violated in the node-based formulations. A virtual path between a node-pair is simply a path in the logical network G between the two nodes.
