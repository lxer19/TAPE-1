Title: Evolution Strategies for Vector Optimization

Abstract: Evolution strategies | a stochastic optimization method originally designed for single criterion problems | have been modified in such a way that they can also tackle multiple criteria problems. Instead of computing only one efficient solution interactively, a decision maker can collect as many members of the Pareto set as needed before making up his mind. Apart from this feature one could also reflect upon the algorithm as a simple model of biological evolution. Following this idea one might emphasize the algorithm's capability of self-adapting its parameters. Furthermore, the effect of polyploid individuals corresponds in both `worlds'.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It has become increasingly obvious that the optimization under a single scalar-valued criterion | often a monetary one | fails to reflect the variety of aspects in a world getting more and more complex. Although V. Pareto <ref> [4] </ref> laid the mathematical foundations already about a hundred years ago the existing tools for multiple criteria decision making often demand too much of non-mathematicians who want to use them.
