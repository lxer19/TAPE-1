Reference-contexts: A Moving planar surface (a pseudo projective transformation): 8 parameters [ Adiv, 1985; Bergen et al., 1992 ] u (x; y) = a + bx + cy + gx 2 + hxy, The computation framework is based on multiresolu-tion and iterations, using a Gaussian pyramid, as described in <ref> [ Bergen and Adelson, 1987; Irani et al., 1994 ] </ref> . One of the major properties of this framework is that it finds the motion parameters of a single image region [ Burt et al., 1991 ] , even when the image contain several different motions.

Reference-contexts: To remove the need for accurate motion models, and to reduce the dependency on the arbitrarily selected threshold for the prediction error, it is proposed to examine the convergence of the prediction error, rather than the prediction error itself. In an iterative process of region-based motion computation <ref> [ Bergen et al., 1992 ] </ref> followed by computing the prediction error, those points for which the prediction error is being reduced are considered as fl This research was sponsored by ARPA through the U.S. Office of Naval Research under grant N00014-93-1-1202, R&T Project Code 4424341|01. a coherent region. <p> Translation: 2 parameters, u (x; y) = a, v (x; y) = d.

Reference-contexts: One of the major properties of this framework is that it finds the motion parameters of a single image region <ref> [ Burt et al., 1991 ] </ref> , even when the image contain several different motions. This region will be called the Dominant Region having the Dominant Motion. <p> Given two frames I 1 (x; y) and I 2 (x; y), the global translation of the entire image is calculated. This step converges to the dominant translation even without segmentation <ref> [ Burt et al., 1991 ] </ref> . 2. Frame I 2 is warped towards frame I 1 using the motion parameters that were computed in the previous step. 3. The Segmentation Measure S (x; y) is computed (Eq. 6). 4.
