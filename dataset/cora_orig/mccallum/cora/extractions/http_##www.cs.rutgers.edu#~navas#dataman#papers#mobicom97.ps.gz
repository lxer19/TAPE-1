Abstract: In the near future GPS will be widely used, thus allowing a broad variety of location dependent services such as direction giving, navigation, etc. In this paper we propose and evaluate a routing and addressing method to integrate geographic coordinates into the Internet Protocol to enable the creation of location dependent services. The main challenge is to integrate the concept of physical location into the current design of the Internet which relies on logical addressing.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, routing to a polygon is 25% more expensive than routing to a circle. In comparison, Bradner <ref> [1] </ref> finds that an IP router will route an IP packet in 1 microsecond (assuming that the address is already in the cache). <p> For instance, the amount of time necessary for a Cisco 7000 IP router to reference its cache using firmware is approximately one microsecond <ref> [1] </ref>. Comparatively, the geographic router needs 93 microseconds to reference its cache even though the cache is implemented as a hash table. One curious experimental result is the difference in routing cost of an extra polygon vertex in a destination polygon versus a routing table entry polygon.

Reference-contexts: The Geographic Messaging Project researched possible system designs for accomplishing geographic messaging. Three designs were looked at: a Domain Name System approach, a multicast approach, and a geographic routing approach. The details of these approaches are specified in RFC 2009 <ref> [5] </ref>. This is a DARPA sponsored Integrated Technology Demonstration (ITD) which is being led by Rutgers DataMan Lab within the GloMo (Global Mobile) program. Under the DARPA experiment, we have implemented a prototype of the geographic routing system described in [5] and are in the process of evaluating it. <p> The details of these approaches are specified in RFC 2009 <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To do this, the router determines if the destination polygon and the router's service area polygon intersect 1 <ref> [6] </ref> each other. If not, then the router simply sends the message to its parent router. However, if the polygons intersect each another, then the router does service the area described by the intersection polygon.
