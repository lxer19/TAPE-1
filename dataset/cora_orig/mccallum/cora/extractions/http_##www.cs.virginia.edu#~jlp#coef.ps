Title: Partition Coefficients of Acyclic Graphs  
Author: John L. Pfaltz 
Affiliation: University of Virginia  
Abstract: We develop the concept of a "closure space" which appears with different names in many aspects of graph theory. We show that acyclic graphs can be almost characterized by the partition coefficients of their associated closure spaces. The resulting nearly total ordering of all acyclic graphs (or partial orders) provides an effective isomorphism filter and the basis for efficient retrieval in secondary storage.

Reference-contexts: With any graph one can postulate a number of invariants. They may be any of a variety of scalar quantities, such as covering or independence numbers [13] or various polynomial expressions, e.g. chromatic polynomials <ref> [1] </ref>. It is desirable 6 That the convex closure of the empty set should be empty is so reasonable, it is taken to be an axiom in [10] and [11]. if the invariant conveys information about the graph. A fairly popular invariant of G is its characteristic polynomial [22].

Reference-contexts: The first thread of binary partitions was studied by Euler as early as 1750. The second thread involving closure spaces is of more recent origin. A binary partition of a positive integer N is its expression as a sum of powers of 2.

Because our intention is to connect these partitions with closure spaces, we will confine our attention to the special case where N is also a power of 2. <p> As before, our interest is the number of binary partitions of 2 n , that is b (2 n ). In <ref> [3] </ref>, it is shown that b (2 n ) = c n;0 + c n;1 (8) where c 1;0 = c 1;1 = 1, c n+1;0 = c n;0 = 1, and c n+1;i = P 2i k=0 c n;k .
