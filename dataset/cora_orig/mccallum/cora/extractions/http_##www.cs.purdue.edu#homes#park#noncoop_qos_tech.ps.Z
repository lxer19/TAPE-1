Abstract: This paper presents a study of the quality of service provision problem in noncooperative network environments where applications or users are assumed to behave in a selfish way. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formulate a model of QoS provision in noncooperative network environments and present a comprehensive game-theoretic analysis of its properties. We give a complete characterization of Nash equilibria and show under what conditions they are system optimal. We show that, in general, Nash equilibria need not be system optimal nor Pareto, and gaps exist to separate the three classes in nontrivial ways. However, for "resource-plentiful" systems, we show that Nash equilibria, Pareto optima, and system optima all coincide, collapsing into a single class. Second, we investigate the problem of facilitating effective quality of service provision in systems with multi-dimensional QoS vectors containing both mean- and variance-related QoS measures. We extend the game-theoretic analysis to multi-dimensional QoS vector games and show under what conditions the aforementioned results transfer over. We also investigate the effect of multiple QoS measures on the properties of the induced QoS levels rendered by service classes. We show that under bursty traffic conditions, it is impossible for a service class to deliver superior QoS in both mean delay and jitter if weighted fair queueing or other GPS-related packet scheduling discipline is used. Third, whereas parts one and two dealt with questions concerning properties of system states as determined by the interaction of selfish applications or users, the third part investigates what the system can do to enhance network QoS provision performance. We present an adaptive service weight control algorithm for GPS-based switches and show its effectiveness at equilibriating imbalances between service class utilizations. We show that total utility can be improved without adversely affecting individual applications|a form of Pareto optimization.

Reference-contexts: The noncooperative network resource allocation approach has been actively pursued by Lazar and his co-workers beginning in the late '80s <ref> [17, 1] </ref> with more recent work carried out jointly with Korilis and Orda [18, 19, 20, 21]. Their main work has revolved around an optimal flow control problem, and the development of techniques needed to show the existence of Nash equilibria using the notion of best reply correspondence [19]. <p> Indeed, the very crux of the QoS provision problem is to give each player i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> the freedom to choose where she wants to send her traffic volume, from service class 1 all the way to service class m. <p> The service rate of the system is given by and we will assume that the switch implements a form of weighted fair queueing (WFQ) with service weights ff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : : ; ff m where ff j 0, j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and P m j=1 ff j = 1. Here, m denotes the number of service classes. The total service rate is split between the two traffic classes = R + NR . <p> The video application, on the other hand, can only tolerate much smaller loss rates, and its utility is concentrated toward 0. Selfishness Selfishness, in our context, will mean that each application i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> will try to take actions so as to maximize its individual utility U i . <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, j 2 [1; m], denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m j=1 ij . That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to. <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 [1; n], j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m j=1 ij . That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to. <p> That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to. We also consider the special case when traffic assignments are restricted to be "all in one bag," i.e., ij 2 f i ; 0g, for all j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Let fl = ( ij : i; j) denote the resource assignment matrix, and let c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c m be the packet loss rates of the m service classes. <p> Each packet loss rate is a function of fl, c j = c j (fl); j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>: Assuming isolatedness 3 , we have c j = c j (q j ) where q j = P n i=1 ij is the total traffic volume assigned to class j. <p> Let k = fl k ; k 6= i; and kfl 0 where kxk 1 = P m j=1 jx j j. That is, L i (fl) is the set of all unilateral strategies for player i. An assignment fl fl is a Nash equilibrium if 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, 8fl 2 L i (fl fl ), U i (fl) U i (fl fl ): 3 Also called insularity or firewall property. 4 An analogous assumption is made in the multi-dimensional QoS vector case. 8 That is, in a Nash equilibrium, player i cannot improve its individual utility U <p> From a resource allocation perspective, we would also like to know under what conditions Nash equilibria are system optimal. Simplifying Assumption To make the analysis tractable, we will work with (unit) step utility functions where for each player i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, U i (c) = 1; if c i , 0; otherwise, where i 0 is a threshold that represents the i'th application's preference. <p> Since c j = c j (q j ), j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, there exist b ij 0 such that U i (c j (q j )) = 1; if q j b ij , 0; otherwise. <p> First, a simple fact on the induced ordering of the traffic volume thresholds b ij .

Since i i+1 , i 2 [1; n 1], by monotonicity of c j , j 2 [1; m], c 1 j ( i+1 ): Noting that b ij = c 1 j ( i ) completes the proof. ffi Let I + i = f j 2 [1; m] : q j &lt; b ij g, <p> Proposition 3.1 8i 2 [1; n 1], 8j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, b ij b i+1j . Proof. Since i i+1 , i 2 [1; n 1], by monotonicity of c j , j 2 [1; m], c 1 j ( i+1 ): Noting that b ij = c 1 j ( i ) completes the proof. ffi Let I + i = f j 2 [1; m] : q j &lt; b ij g, and I 0 q j = b ij g. <p> Proof. Since i i+1 , i 2 [1; n 1], by monotonicity of c j , j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, c 1 j ( i+1 ): Noting that b ij = c 1 j ( i ) completes the proof. ffi Let I + i = f j 2 [1; m] : q j &lt; b ij g, and I 0 q j = b ij g. Given player i, I + i denotes the set of relevant service class indices where the traffic volume assigned exceeds player i's threshold, thus yielding 0 individual utility. <p> The next two propositions give uniform upper bounds on the individual utility of a fixed player where uniformity is with respect to all unilateral strategy changes by the player. Proposition 3.2 Given fl, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, let v i = P i j . Then 8fl 0 2 L i (fl); U i (fl 0 ) v i : Proof. <p> Then 8fl 0 2 L i (fl); U i (fl 0 ) v i : Proof. Since for all j 2 J + i , U i (c j (fl 0 )) = 0, the upper bound v i follows immediately. ffi Proposition 3.3 Given fl, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, let i &gt; v i and J + i = ;. Then 9j fl 2 J fl i such that 8fl 0 2 L i (fl); U i (fl 0 ) v i (b ij fl q i 10 Proof. <p> Theorem 3.4 (Nash Characterization) fl is a Nash equilibrium iff 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> either (a) I + (b) I i 6= ;, J i , or i = ;, J + i such that J i n fj fl g I 0 Proof. (( ). Assume I + i = ; (part (a)). <p> Thus, we can apply Proposition 3.3 which in conjunction with the lower bound on U i (fl) yields U i (fl) = v i (b ij fl q i j fl ). ( )). We will prove the contrapositive. That is, assuming 9 i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, given fl, such that I + i 6= ; _ J + i * I 0 ^ ( I i 6= ; _ 8j fl 2 J fl i n fj fl g * I 0 we will show that fl is not Nash. <p> We can construct an assignment fl 0 2 L i (fl) such that 0 i` = i` , ` 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>nfj; j 0 g, and 0 0 ij 0 = ij 0 + *, where * = minf ij ; b ij 0 q j 0 g. This yields U i (fl 0 ) U i (fl) * from which it follows that fl is not a Nash equilibrium. <p> Assume q j &gt; b ij . This implies that U i (c j (fl)) = 0. Since J + i 6= ;, for all j 0 2 J + We can construct fl 0 2 L i (fl) such that 0 i` = i` , ` 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> n fj; j 0 g, and 0 ij 0 = ij 0 + *, where * = q j b ij . <p> Construct the assignment fl 0 2 L i (fl) such that 0 i` = i` , ` 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> n fj; j 0 g, and 0 0 ij 0 = ij 0 + *, where * = q j b ij . <p> Then 9 fl 0 with U (fl 0 ) = U (fl) such that (a) 8i &lt; i fl 0 , U i (fl 0 ) = 0, and 12 Proof. Let S i fl = f i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> : i &lt; i fl ; U i (fl) 6= 0 g. By the definition of i fl , for all i &gt; i fl , U i (fl) = i , which gives (b). If S i fl = ;, then we are done. <p> Assume S i fl 6= ;. We will construct as assignment fl 0 from fl such that it satisfies property (a) while preserving (b). Notice that by Theorem 3.4 and i fl &gt; U i fl (fl), q j b i fl j for all j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Also, by Proposition 3.1, b i fl j b ij for all i 2 S i fl . <p> To avoid otherwise disturbing the utility assignment, we will move a commensurate amount from -, exactly filling the gap left by . That is, q 0 j = q j , j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, in the modified assignment fl 0 . If - &gt; , the reassignment can be achieved in one round. If - , a refined construction is used that iteratively shrinks the violating player set S i fl until it becomes empty. <p> If - , a refined construction is used that iteratively shrinks the violating player set S i fl until it becomes empty. Following is a formal description of the construction. Case (i). Assume - &gt; . Let K = f j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> : q j = b ij ; ij &gt; 0; i 2 S i fl g, K + = f j 2 [1; m] : q j &gt; b i fl j ; i fl j &gt; 0 g. We construct fl 0 as follows. <p> Following is a formal description of the construction. Case (i). Assume - &gt; .

We construct fl 0 as follows. <p> For all other i and j, 0 ij = ij . By construction, q 0 j = q j for j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and since the excess utility has been transferred into service classes belonging to K + , we have U i (fl 0 ) = 0 for i 2 S i fl . Hence, i fl 0 = i fl . <p> In the first round, we transfer a traffic volume of from players i 2 S i fl with assignments in K to service classes belonging to K + . To preserve, q 0 j = q j , j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, we transfer an equal amount from player i fl 's assignments in K + to K . This is possible since - . <p> We will prove the following statement from which the theorem follows immediately: fl 0 is not system optimal iff there is a fl fl with U (fl fl ) &gt; U (fl 0 ) such that (a) 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, U i (fl fl ) U i (fl 0 ), and (b) 9 i i fl 0 such that U i (fl fl ) &gt; U i (fl 0 ). That is, fl 0 is not Pareto optimal. <p> We can perform a switch in assignments between players in L and L + , similar to the proof of Lemma 3.5, obtaining an assignment fl fl which preserves q fl j = ~q j , j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and which satisfies 8i 2 L + , U i (fl fl ) = U i (fl 0 ), 8i 2 L , U i (fl fl ) U i (fl 0 ), and for at least one element i 2 L , U i (fl fl ) &gt; <p> Pick any two players i 2 L , i + 2 L + .

Theorem 3.13 (Resource-Plentiful System) If for every player i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, it holds that m X q j j=1 then the following statements hold.

Let A j denote the set of application indices i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> currently assigned to service class j 2 [1; m]. Let j = jA j j i2A j That is, j = ( j j s ) T is the average application QoS requirement vector of applications currently assigned to class j. <p> The price decrease mechanism is affected in the following way.

QoS-Related Network Games Several papers have addressed the more specific issue of multi-class QoS provision in high-speed networks using microeconomic models <ref> [4, 28, 39, 16] </ref>. In [28, 39], utility functions are defined with link bandwidth and switch buffers acting as substitutable resources, and Pareto-optimal allocation of resources among service classes is affected either by the network exercising admission control [39] or by users performing purchasing decisions [28]. <p> As stated earlier, an important goal of our approach is to use a noncooperative framework and shield the user from having to make complex computations to estimate service quality. The models and approaches are thus clearly dissimilar. In <ref> [4] </ref>, a general framework for investigating pricing in networks is proposed, with service discipline and pricing policy acting as design variables. Simulation results are shown that depict the existence of "desirable" price ranges related to system optimality. <p> Four types of applications with different QoS requirements were tested with priority settings either set to 1 or 2. Our model is an n-application, m-service class, s-dimensional QoS vector quality service provision model, and emphasizes a different set of questions from <ref> [4] </ref> where the effect of pricing incentives are paramount. We apply noncooperative game-theoretic analysis to the multi-dimensional QoS vector model to understand under what conditions Nash equilibria exist and are system or Pareto optimal.

Comparison with Models by Korilis et al. and Shenker The flow or congestion control models of Korilis et al. <ref> [19] </ref> and Shenker [40] represent a form of quality of service provision and it is important to explicate the differences between our model and theirs, given that all three follow the noncooperative framework. <p> The main difference between the models by Korilis et al. and Shenker, and Park et al. is that, indeed, theirs is a flow or congestion control model. Phrased in the language of the QoS provision model defined in Section 2.3, both <ref> [19] </ref> and [40] correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to service class i, and either ii 0 [40] or 0 ii i [19], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. <p> Phrased in the language of the QoS provision model defined in Section 2.3, both <ref> [19] </ref> and [40] correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to service class i, and either ii 0 [40] or 0 ii i [19], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. That is, a player, being tied to a fixed service class, has the option of controlling how much traffic [40]|or using what time schedule [19]|to send his traffic but not where. <p> Hence, our QoS provision model is fundamentally different from their flow control models, being more complex and producing equilibria structures that are different from <ref> [19] </ref>, [40]. Secondly, our model incorporates multi-dimensional QoS vectors whose consequences are then analyzed in both game-theoretic and network performance terms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the overall set-up and formulate the network QoS provision model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Background With the increased deployment of high-speed local- and wide-area networks carrying a multitude of information from e-mail to bulk data to voice and video, provisioning adequate quality of service (QoS) to the diverse application base has become an important problem <ref> [2, 10, 24, 29] </ref>. This paper describes a QoS provision architecture suited for best-effort environments, based on ideas from microeconomics and noncooperative game theory. <p> Quality of service is an induced phenomenon, achieved as a result of interaction between selfish applications.

Although research abounds <ref> [5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 25, 29, 30, 31, 7] </ref>, analytic tools for computing QoS guarantees rely on shaping input traffic, to preserve well-behavedness across switches which implement some form of packet scheduling discipline [8, 30] such as GPS 1 However, real-time constraints of multi-media traffic and the scale-invariant burstiness associated

Reference-contexts: Several papers have addressed the issue of multi-class QoS provision in high-speed networks <ref> [4, 19, 28, 40, 39, 35] </ref>. <p> a cooperative framework or place significant computing responsibilities on the part of the user [28, 39], some investigate the effect of pricing incentives [4], and others represent flow or congestion control models that only partially address 1 Also known as weighted fair queueing. 1 the quality of service problem problem <ref> [19, 40] </ref>. The present approach differs from previous works in two significant ways|first, it is one of the most comprehensive noncooperative resource allocation models specifically formulated to model QoS provision, and second, we address both theoretical and practical aspects, with emphasis on bridging the gap from theory to realizability. <p> Another significant thrust in noncooperative network games is due to recent work by Shenker <ref> [40] </ref> where it is shown how choosing a packet scheduling discipline can influence the nature of the Nash equilibria attained. <p> We also investigate the problem of facilitating service classes with induced QoS levels that match application requirements when multiple QoS indicators are present. Comparison with Models by Korilis et al. and Shenker The flow or congestion control models of Korilis et al. [19] and Shenker <ref> [40] </ref> represent a form of quality of service provision and it is important to explicate the differences between our model and theirs, given that all three follow the noncooperative framework. <p> The main difference between the models by Korilis et al. and Shenker, and Park et al. is that, indeed, theirs is a flow or congestion control model. Phrased in the language of the QoS provision model defined in Section 2.3, both [19] and <ref> [40] </ref> correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to service class i, and either ii 0 [40] or 0 ii i [19], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. <p> Phrased in the language of the QoS provision model defined in Section 2.3, both [19] and <ref> [40] </ref> correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to service class i, and either ii 0 [40] or 0 ii i [19], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. That is, a player, being tied to a fixed service class, has the option of controlling how much traffic [40]|or using what time schedule [19]|to send his traffic but not where. <p> Hence, our QoS provision model is fundamentally different from their flow control models, being more complex and producing equilibria structures that are different from [19], <ref> [40] </ref>. Secondly, our model incorporates multi-dimensional QoS vectors whose consequences are then analyzed in both game-theoretic and network performance terms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the overall set-up and formulate the network QoS provision model.
