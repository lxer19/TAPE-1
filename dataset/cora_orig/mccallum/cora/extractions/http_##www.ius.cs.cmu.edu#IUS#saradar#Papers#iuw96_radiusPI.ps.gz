Abstract: The Automated Site Construction, Extension, Detection and Refinement system (ASCENDER) has been developed to automatically populate a site model with buildings extracted from multiple, overlapping views. Version 1.0 of the system has been delivered for evaluation on classified imagery. Evaluation results on an unclassified Ft.Hood data set are presented here. Extensions to the system that allow it to detect a wide range of building classes, including peaked roof and multi-level flat roofed structures are described. Recent work on symbolic extraction of surface structures such as windows greatly enhances the visual realism of graphical site model displays.

Reference-contexts: The process is described briefly here, with particular attention given to the algorithmic parameters that can be set by the user to vary the number and quality of the resulting building hypotheses. Building detection begins by extracting straight line segments using the Boldt algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Intensity edgels are grouped recursively into longer straight lines with subpixel accuracy via a set of Gestalt perceptual organization criteria. Two user thresholds, minimum line length and minimum contrast (gray-level difference across the line), are available to control the set of lines returned.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Research and Development for Image Understanding Systems (RADIUS) project is a national effort to apply image understanding (IU) technology to support model-based aerial image analysis <ref> [5] </ref>. Automated construction and management of 3D geometric site models enables efficient exploitation of the tremendous volume of information collected daily by national sensors. The expected benefits are decreased work-load on human analysts, together with an increase in measurement accuracy due to the introduction of digital IU and photogrammetric techniques. <p> In mid-April 1995, Version 1.0 of the Ascender system was delivered to Lockheed-Martin for testing on classified imagery and for integration into the RADIUS Testbed System <ref> [5] </ref>. At the same time, an informal transfer was made to the National Exploitation Laboratory (NEL) for familiarization and additional testing. This section presents a brief overview of the Ascender system and its approach to extracting building models. More detailed descriptions can be found in [2, 3, 4].

Reference-contexts: Two user thresholds, minimum line length and minimum contrast (gray-level difference across the line), are available to control the set of lines returned. Two-dimensional building roof boundaries are hypothesized from extracted image line segments via a graph-based perceptual grouping algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. Lines segments are grouped into corners, chains, and eventually into complete closed polygons. A single variable sensitivity parameter ranging from 0.0 (very low sensitivity) to 1.0 (very high) controls the settings of several less-intuitive internal parameters that govern the polygon grouping process. <p> The graph-based perceptual organization algorithm used in Ascender for organizing lines and corners into closed 2D polygons <ref> [6] </ref> has been modified to handle 2.5D lines. An additional set of 3D consistency checks have been introduced to ensure that compatible lines and corners are roughly at the same elevation in the scene. Individual line heights are combined and propagated into grouped corner, chain, and polygon hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: The DEM data is produced from a pair of overlapping images by hierarchical, area-based correlation matching along epipolar lines <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to extract paramteric surfaces, pixels within each detected roof polygon are backprojected onto the DEM data to determine a set of sampled 3D points. Since the DEM data is potentially noisy, due to rooftop clutter and mismatches, robust statistical estimation techniques are used to do the fitting.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 presents results of an evaluation conducted at UMass on an unclassified data set of Ft.Hood Texas. The system is being extended via new strategies for acquiring models of other common building classes such as peaked and multi-level roof structures, which are described in Section 4 and in <ref> [9] </ref> (these proceedings). <p> By verifying geomet ric consistencies between 2D and 3D tokens asso-ciated with building components, larger and more complex 3D structures are being organized using context-sensitive, knowledge-based strategies. A more comprehensive description of the new types of extracted geometric features, and methods for grouping/fusing them is given in <ref> [9] </ref> (these proceedings).
