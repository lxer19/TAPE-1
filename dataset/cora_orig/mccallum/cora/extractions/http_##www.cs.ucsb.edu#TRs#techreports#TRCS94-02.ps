Abstract: The characteristics of geographic data and the nature of geographic research require the participation of many agents. Data is generated by multiple sources (satellites, ground observation, weather stations, photography, etc.), accessed, processed and transformed by many users and available for use to an even larger population of users. Lack of coordination among all these different agents may render large amounts of work useless. Most existing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) do not provide any support for cooperative work, which adds to the problem. To overcome this serious limitation while still allowing users to take advantage of GIS technology, we propose GOOSE, a system implemented as a top layer for existing GIS. GOOSE provides the tools for constructing large geographic models in a cooperative environment with potentially many users and participants.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, these objects could coexist in the same GOOSE system, which provides an effective way to combine heterogeneous systems. The metadata attributes of an object store information describing the data interdependencies of that particular object. To model these interdependencies, we have identified <ref> [AE92] </ref> a class of interactions between transactions in a database (similar to the conventional reads-from, over-writes and reads-before relations [BHG87]). This class can be captured using graphs but, for efficiency reasons, the information has been encoded within each object. <p> The theoretical background is related to transaction processing in that the data interdependencies created by the application of transformations are seen as a set of interactions between transactions, although this work is beyond the scope of this paper, most of the ideas on metadata originate from it <ref> [AE92] </ref>. The issue of cooperation between different agents appeared in the early stages of design, when it became clear that the complexity of the geographic models treated required the participation of many users.

Reference-contexts: An object, in GOOSE terminology, has a name (given by the user), an identifier (generated by the system and for internal use only) and two sets of attributes, data and metadata attributes <ref> [AE93] </ref>. The data attributes contain the reference to the actual dataset and how to retrieve the data. This reference can be a pointer, a file name, a query, a shell script that extracts data from a set of files, etc.

Reference-contexts: The notion of data attributes of an object are related to ideas borrowed from traditional database design and view management techniques. The metadata attributes were motivated by the need to avoid the problem of uninterpreted legacy data, so common in geographic applications <ref> [Arm88, Xia89, Rad91, Cea93] </ref>, and the need to provide some mechanisms to record the activities of multiple users collaborating in the same model.

Reference-contexts: We start by first noting that the system should support several concurrent modeling efforts. This means to allow multiple users to access the same set of data, which is essentially the same as supporting multiple views of the underlying storage system <ref> [BCL86, BLT86, LHM86, Han87] </ref>. Consider for instance the two uses made of the soil map. The erosion model is likely to focus more on certain properties of the terrain such as its physical composition.

Reference-contexts: The metadata attributes of an object store information describing the data interdependencies of that particular object. To model these interdependencies, we have identified [AE92] a class of interactions between transactions in a database (similar to the conventional reads-from, over-writes and reads-before relations <ref> [BHG87] </ref>). This class can be captured using graphs but, for efficiency reasons, the information has been encoded within each object. In this way an object can be described 9 entirely and correctly interpreted solely using information contained in the object itself.

Reference-contexts: To some extent these models are also used to answer "what if" type of questions with new parameters, more accurate inputs, and more complex algorithms. To support such a basic aspect of modeling, the system must provide automatic change propagation (a term borrowed from design databases <ref> [BK85, CK86] </ref>), i.e., when the input to a model changes, the entire model is run again to get a new version of the output. Furthermore, these changes occur as versions of the same dataset so the system must also provide version control capabilities. <p> Research on GOOSE is part of a larger project in GIS currently being developed at UCSB [SSAE93]. Many of the concepts it implements are common to advanced database applications, especially design databases where ideas such as change propagation were first proposed <ref> [BK85, CK86] </ref>. The theoretical background is related to transaction processing in that the data interdependencies created by the application of transformations are seen as a set of interactions between transactions, although this work is beyond the scope of this paper, most of the ideas on metadata originate from it [AE92].

Reference-contexts: This approach restricts the amount of data manipulation that can take place and there is no provision to support large models that may involve several interrelated datasets. An examples of this approach is GEO++ <ref> [vOV91, dHvO92] </ref>. When the large volumes of existing geographic data are considered, it becomes clear that some means are necessary to locate relevant data. Some GIS concentrate on the task of allowing users to navigate through different data repositories.

They can be more or less complete, but their architecture reflects the fact that the data is used as input to a complex set of transformations.

However, it is difficult to compare GOOSE with existing systems since it is not a GIS in itself.

In a legacy system, multiple users "cooperate" during a long period of time by adding information to the system. <p> In GIS environments, the meaning of the data is often exogenous and not found in the data itself [Tob79]. Moreover, the ability to create new data is far greater than that of keeping track of how the data was created <ref> [Lan88] </ref>. In this framework, the concept of an object that can be treated as a semantic unit independently of the underlying storage system is an important contribution. 4.3. Project Base Projects in GOOSE are seen as a transformation from a set of input objects to a set of output objects.

For example GOOSE will be eventually incorporated into a larger GIS project <ref> [SSAE93] </ref> that defines its own language for data manipulation, MDBL, and an execution model [SS93]. This adaptation will require only to redefine the interpreter. Once several interpreters are available, GOOSE can be effectively used as a tool binding together heterogeneous GIS, allowing cooperative modeling across different platforms. 8 4.2. <p> However, it is difficult to compare GOOSE with existing systems since it is not a GIS in itself. Research on GOOSE is part of a larger project in GIS currently being developed at UCSB <ref> [SSAE93] </ref>. Many of the concepts it implements are common to advanced database applications, especially design databases where ideas such as change propagation were first proposed [BK85, CK86].

Reference-contexts: The "label" approach allows multiple views of the datasets and establishes the object as a self-contained semantic unit. In GIS environments, the meaning of the data is often exogenous and not found in the data itself <ref> [Tob79] </ref>. Moreover, the ability to create new data is far greater than that of keeping track of how the data was created [Lan88]. In this framework, the concept of an object that can be treated as a semantic unit independently of the underlying storage system is an important contribution. 4.3.

Reference-contexts: This approach restricts the amount of data manipulation that can take place and there is no provision to support large models that may involve several interrelated datasets. An examples of this approach is GEO++ <ref> [vOV91, dHvO92] </ref>. When the large volumes of existing geographic data are considered, it becomes clear that some means are necessary to locate relevant data. Some GIS concentrate on the task of allowing users to navigate through different data repositories.

Reference-contexts: The notion of data attributes of an object are related to ideas borrowed from traditional database design and view management techniques. The metadata attributes were motivated by the need to avoid the problem of uninterpreted legacy data, so common in geographic applications <ref> [Arm88, Xia89, Rad91, Cea93] </ref>, and the need to provide some mechanisms to record the activities of multiple users collaborating in the same model.

Reference-contexts: This is also intended to motivate the discussion of the features that the system should provide. The example, shown in Figure 1 has been simplified for clarity and has been adapted from <ref> [ZG91, SS93] </ref>. The purpose of the overall model is to study the changes in the erosion patterns, vegetation and hydrographic characteristics of the area. It can be divided in three major, interleaved, parts.
