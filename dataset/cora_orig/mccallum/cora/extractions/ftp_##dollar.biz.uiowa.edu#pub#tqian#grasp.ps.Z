Abstract: A Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is a randomized heuristic that has produced high quality solutions for a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems. The NP-complete Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Problem is to find the minimum number of vertices that need to be removed from a directed graph so that the resulting graph has no directed cycle. The FVS problem has found applications in many fields, including VLSI design, program verification, and statistical inference. In this paper, we develop a GRASP for the the FVS problem. We describe GRASP construction mechanisms and local search, as well as some efficient problem reduction techniques. We report computational experience on a set of test problems using three variants of GRASP.

In this study, since the greedy function is directly linked to the degree of the vertex, there is usually a large number of vertices having the same greedy function value.

Reference-contexts: For a fixed number of nodes, as the number of arcs increases, the relative performance of GRASP B with respect to both GRASP A and GRASP C improves. * Since the GRASP iterations are independent of each other, GRASP can be easily parallelized <ref> [5, 12] </ref>. On the largest instance solved (1000 nodes and 50,000 arcs), 100 GRASP iterations required over 6 hours of CPU time.

Reference-contexts: Hardware configuration (partial output of system command hinv) The experiments were carried out using two sets of test problems. 1 The first data set was used in Funke and Reinelt <ref> [7] </ref>. Those instances are randomly generated with varying number of vertices and varying densities and have known optimal solutions. The second set of test problems are randomly generated, having from 50 to 1000 vertices and varying densities.

Reference-contexts: A cutset is a set of vertices whose removal from the graph eliminates all directed cycles of the graph. The minimum cardinality cutset is called the feedback vertex set. The FVS problem is known to be NP-complete <ref> [8, 19] </ref> and has found applications in many diverse areas, including program verification [17], deadlock prevention [18], and Bayesian inference [20]. The FVS problem can be formulated as a set covering problem.

Reference-contexts: We call this solution the GRASP solution. In this paper, a GRASP is applied to the FVS problem. Several degree-related greedy functions are used in the construction of the RCL. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, we incorporate problem reduction techniques <ref> [9] </ref> into the construction phase of GRASP. The iterative construction of the solution alternates between the choice of a vertex from the RCL and the optimal solution preserving reduction. The motivation is that when we add a new vertex to the partial solution, the problem size is reduced. <p> GRASP local search phase pseudo-code a detailed analysis of these reduction procedures, see also Levy and Lowe <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.3. Construction of the RCL. There are several ways to build an RCL. In one approach, the RCL is made up of the k candidates with the largest value of the adaptive greedy function [4]. In another, it is made up of a variable number of well ranked elements.
