Title: Improving the Interfaces to Interactive Case Memories  
Author: Andrew M. Dearden 
Date: December 20, 1994  
Abstract: An interactive case memory (ICM) is a system that interacts with a human user to gather information about a problem, interpret that information and search a store of previous cases to flnd cases that may be useful in solving the new problem. Many of the commercially successful products that have been derived from research on case-based reasoning could be described as ICMs. ICMs are type of advisory knowledge based system (KBS). Research on the design of interfaces to rule-based advisory KBSs has suggested that a user of such a system should be allowed to take control in interaction with the KBS. The user should be able to review their input, select the reasoning strategy used and re-direct the KBS towards particular hypotheses. In this paper I discuss how existing knowledge about interfaces to advisory KBSs can be applied to the design of interfaces to ICMs. I present a prototype ICM that demonstrates some of the facilities that could be incorporated into an ICM to increase the user's control over the interaction.

Reference-contexts: The questions are ordered by an information gain metric similar to that used in ID3 <ref> (Quinlan, 1983) </ref>. If the user wants to pursue a particular case this can be achieved by clicking on the case name. The result of this action is to generate a dialogue in which the features of the case are used to suggest constraints that the user might wish to apply.

The success of any interactive knowledge based system (KBS), whether it be rule-based or case-based, is dependent not only on the quality of the knowledge encapsulated within the system but also on the quality of the interaction that the system supports.

Reference-contexts: Some authors have argued that a major reason for this was a lack of attention to the user interface requirements during their design <ref> (Young, 1989) </ref>. A common observation from studies of human-human advisory dialogues, see e.g. Pollack (1985), Kidd (1985), Aaronson and Carrol (1987), is that the clients of advisory services often volunteer new information that is not requested by the advisor, and/or propose their own solutions for analysis by the advisor.
