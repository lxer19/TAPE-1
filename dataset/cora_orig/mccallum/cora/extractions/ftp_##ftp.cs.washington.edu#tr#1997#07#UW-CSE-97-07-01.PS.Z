Title: Representation and Learnability in Visual Languages for Web-based Interpersonal Communication

Abstract: Computer-based visual languages have been developed primarily in order to help people program and operate computers. Now that many people in the world have personal computers with good graphics and Internet connections, we are seeing a great deal of informal electronic visual communication via web pages. More formal visual languages can be expected to appear on the Internet in the near future. Visual languages offer various possible advantages to textual email, such as permitting communication between people who don't speak or read the same textual language and such as permitting the incorporation of rich graphical material. Designing these languages requires making some important decisions about ontology, visual representation, interactivity, and how users learn the language, as well as about the more traditional issues of language design such as syntax. The power of the computer to generate alternative views of a language object can be harnessed by incorporating an iconic-symbolic continuum as a basic representational axis. Concreteness of representation in limited domains can be achieved by the use of microworld-like simulations. However, the objects in these simulations can convey richer meanings by associations with real-world people and objects. This paper presents a variety of research questions and briefly attempts to answer a few of them. Copyright 1997 IEEE. Published in the Proceedings of VL'97, September 23-26, 1997 in Capri, Italy.

Reference-contexts: Internet: interactivity, international aspects, time delays, distortions and possible misinterpretations due to bandwidth limitations? What is the relationship between a visual language and its associated ontology? Within what social situations are visual languages effective? 1.3 A Historical View The use of drawings for human communication is very old and fundamental <ref> [1] </ref>. From the cave paintings at Lascaux to children's drawings today, iconic representation has played a fundamental role in human expression. Images and spatial forms are not only used to represent scenes and physical objects but also processes and more abstract notions.

Timothy Ingen-Housz has developed a beautiful system of pictographs featuring smoothly curved strokes and a simple two-dimensional grammar for composing sentences [25] (see Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: Here are perhaps the best known of these. (Heavily evolved languages such as written Chinese are related, but excluded from this discussion.) 3.1 Blissymbols The most comprehensive modern visual language for communication among humans is with little doubt the system developed by Charles Bliss <ref> [6] </ref> called "Se-mantography." This system, originally developed during the 1930s and 1940s, had as its objective the elimination of written language barriers among people, especially scientists, all over the world [35].

Reference-contexts: For example, Blissymbolics Communication International (a nonprofit organization headquartered in Canada) coordinates the extensions to the official list of Bliss symbols <ref> [7] </ref>. If a new language is developed, it would need a similar committee in order to respond to the needs of its community. When each language object can have multiple views, additional work is needed to ensure that the views use representational conventions consistently.

Reference-contexts: A Symbol is a sign which refers to the Object that it denotes by virtue of a law, usually an association of general ideas, which operates to cause the Symbol to be interpreted as referring to that Object." (Peirce in Buchler <ref> [8] </ref>, 1955, p.102). In other words, the meaning of an icon is in principle independent of the person making the interpretation. This independence of meaning on the particular interpreter is what makes a visual language potentially international in character.

Reference-contexts: The microworlds found in video games have particular ontologies. Relatively explicit ontologies for subsets of natural language and "common sense" have been developed by researchers in artificial intelligence (see, for example [42], p.188). Methodologies for constructing ontologies have also been developed <ref> [23] </ref>. Learnability of a language is enhanced if the ontology for the language is simple and explicit. If a person understands the ontology, s/he knows what can be expressed in the language. If the ontology is explicit, then it is easier to learn than if it is hidden.

Reference-contexts: The microworlds found in video games have particular ontologies. Relatively explicit ontologies for subsets of natural language and "common sense" have been developed by researchers in artificial intelligence (see, for example <ref> [42] </ref>, p.188). Methodologies for constructing ontologies have also been developed [23]. Learnability of a language is enhanced if the ontology for the language is simple and explicit. If a person understands the ontology, s/he knows what can be expressed in the language.

Reference-contexts: i.e., through linguistic convention [20], [4], [17], [21], [22], [32], [34]. 2.2 Interpolating in a Continuum It is often possible to create a succession of increasingly stylized signs, beginning with a realistic image and ending with an abstract symbol, that permits a novice to readily understand an abstract symbolic association <ref> [43] </ref>. Furthermore, iconic representation can sometimes be taken to an information-theoretical extreme, and surprisingly abstract concepts can be communicated using minimal icons [40], [10].

When a visual message is sent, it is posted via a Perl script in a persistent associative memory on a central server. At the same time, a URL containing a unique key is sent via email to the recipient, who later uses it to retrieve the message and launch its animation. </title>
