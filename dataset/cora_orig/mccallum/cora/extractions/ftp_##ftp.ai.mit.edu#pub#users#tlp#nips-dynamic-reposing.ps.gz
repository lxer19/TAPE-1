Abstract: In drug activity prediction (as in handwritten character recognition), the features extracted to describe a training example depend on the pose (location, orientation, etc.) of the example. In handwritten character recognition, one of the best techniques for addressing this problem is the tangent distance method of Simard, LeCun and Denker (1993). Jain, et al. (1993a; 1993b) introduce a new technique|dynamic reposing|that also addresses this problem. Dynamic reposing iteratively learns a neural network and then reposes the examples in an effort to maximize the predicted output values. New models are trained and new poses computed until models and poses converge. This paper compares dynamic reposing to the tangent distance method on the task of predicting the biological activity of musk compounds. In a 20-fold cross-validation,

Reference-contexts: Musk odor is a specific and clearly identifiable sensation, although the mechanisms underlying it are poorly understood. Musk odor is determined almost entirely by steric (i.e., "molecular shape") effects <ref> (Ohloff, 1986) </ref>. The addition or deletion of a single methyl group can convert an odorless compound into a strong musk. Musk molecules are similar in size and composition to many kinds of drug molecules.

Reference-contexts: The feature vectors V (x i ; p j+1 i ) corresponding to these poses are added to the pool of poses, and a new hypothesis g j+1 is learned. This process iterates until the poses cease to change. Note that this algorithm is analogous to the EM procedure <ref> (Redner & Walker, 1984) </ref> in that we accomplish the simultaneous optimization of g and the poses fp i g by conducting a series of separate optimizations of g (holding fp i g fixed) and fp i g (holding g fixed).

Reference-contexts: In addition, S must determine the orientation of the bioactive conformers within the binding site. This is also quite difficult|the bioactive conformers must be mutually aligned so that shared potential chemical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bond donors) are superimposed. 2.2 TANGENT PROPAGATION The tangent-prop approach <ref> (Simard, Victorri, LeCun, & Denker, 1992) </ref> also employs a standardizing function S, but it augments the learning procedure with the constraint that the output of the learned function g (V (x; p)) should be invariant with respect to slight changes in the poses of the examples: fl fl where k k

Reference-contexts: Without the tangent-prop constraint, the learning algorithm may identify features that "accidentally" discriminate between classes. However, tangent-prop still assumes that the standard poses are correct. This is not a safe assumption in drug activity prediction. 2.3 TANGENT DISTANCE The tangent-distance approach <ref> (Simard, LeCun & Denker, 1993) </ref> is a variant of the nearest-neighbor algorithm that addresses the feature manifold problem.
