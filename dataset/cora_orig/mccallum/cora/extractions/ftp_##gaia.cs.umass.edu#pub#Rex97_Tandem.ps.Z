Abstract: CMPSCI Technical Report 97-33 May 1997 University of Massachusetts at Amherst Available via ftp://gaia.cs.umass.edu/pub/Rex97:Tandem.ps.Z Abstract The burstiness of compressed video complicates the provisioning of network resources for emerging multimedia services. For stored video applications, the server can smooth the variable-bit-rate stream by prefetching frames into the client playback buffer in advance of each burst. Drawing on a priori knowledge of the frame lengths and client buffer size, such bandwidth smoothing techniques can minimize the peak and variability of the rate requirements while avoiding underflow and overflow of the playback buffer. However, in an internetworking environment, a single service provider typically does not control the entire path from the stored-video server to the client buffer. To develop efficient techniques for transmitting variable-bit-rate video across a portion of the route, we investigate bandwidth smoothing across a tandem of nodes, which may or may not include the server and client sites. We show that it is possible to compute an optimal transmission schedule for the tandem system by solving a collection of independent single-link problems. To develop efficient techniques for minimizing the network bandwidth requirements, we characterize how the peak rate varies as a function of the buffer allocation and the playback delay. Simulation experiments illustrate the subtle interplay between buffer space, playback delay, and bandwidth requirements for a collection of full-length video traces. These analytic and empirical results suggest effective heuristics for provisioning network services for the transmission of compressed video.

Reference-contexts: For an N -frame video that traverses n links, this optimal schedule can be computed in O (nN ) time by applying an existing O (N ) algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> to the smoothing constraints on each link. Then, in Section 4 and Section 5, we characterize how a video's peak-bandwidth requirement varies as a function of the buffer distribution and start-up delay in the tandem system. <p> Applying the theory of majorization to the bandwidth smoothing problem, there exists an O (N ) algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> which finds a vector S fl 2 S (L; U) such that R (S fl ) R (S) for all S 2 S (L; U). <p> Hence, change points always reside on the L or U curves, with S fl k = U k at convex points (rate increases) and S fl k = L k at concave points (rate decreases) <ref> [9] </ref>, as in the example in Figure 1. <p> By reducing the tandem system to a collection of independent single-link problems, we show that the majorization algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> can be used to compute an optimal schedule for each of the nodes. Then, by characterizing the shape of the peak-bandwidth curve, we show that simple binary-search algorithms can be used to optimize the allocation of buffer space and start-up delay.

Reference-contexts: the second graph plots the peak bandwidth as a function of the buffer size b for twenty full-length motion-JPEG traces. 2.3 Domination and Refinement Results The majorization algorithm has several properties that facilitate comparisons between different instances of the bandwidth smoothing problem; in particular, the following domination and refinement lemmas <ref> [14] </ref> play an important role in analyzing the models introduced in Section 3 and Section 4. <p> Similarly, if U 1 = U 2 , and k is a convex change point in S fl 1 , then it is a convex change point in S fl 2 . Proof. This was established in <ref> [14] </ref>. Focusing on one set of constraints (L; U), the domination lemma implies that raising the U curve causes concave change points to gradually disappear in the corresponding majorization schedules; similarly, lowering the L curve causes convex change points to gradually disappear. <p> These change points disappear at a series of critical buffer sizes. Drawing on this result, the refinement property characterizes how the majorization schedule changes with the size of the prefetch buffer. With a slight rephrasing of the result in <ref> [14] </ref>, we have: Lemma 2.2 Let U 1 = L 1 + vec (b 1 ) and U 2 = L 2 + vec (b 2 ) be such that b 2 b 1 &gt; 0, where vec (b i ) is a vector whose components are equal to b i <p> If L 1 = L 2 , then the change points in S fl 1 are a superset of the change points in S fl 2 . Proof. This was established in <ref> [14] </ref> by invoking Lemma 2.1 twice.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we are applying the smoothing model in Figure 6 to the transmission of live video, where the ingress node does not know the sizes of future frames; this work extends the initial approach in <ref> [15] </ref> to incorporate constraints on the size of the ingress smoothing buffer. Further generalizations of the tandem smoothing model can include other practical constraints, such as delay jitter and limitations on link speed, as well as efficient video distribution in 19 a multicast tree.
