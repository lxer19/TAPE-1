Abstract: In machine learning, a number of systems learn new knowledge in the form of compiled formats. These systems use the learned compiled formats for achieving future goals. Some times, these compiled formats may cause a system to fail in performing a task. This failure occurs despite the fact that sufficient knowledge for achieving the task is available in the system. In this paper, three characteristics of compiled formats acquired are identified. These characteristics lead such systems to a state in which they experience knowledge blindness or lack of knowledge flexibility. Knowledge flexibility is introduced as a new criterion in evaluating the performance of a learning system. A new paradigm: Flexible Learning of Concepts by Examples (FlexLearn) is presented to over come knowledge blindness. A measure for evaluating the flexibility of a learning system is presented. This measure adds another criteria when evaluating a learning system especially if it is used as a knowledge acquisition tool.

Reference-contexts: The two terms: flexibility and blindness, will be used interchangeably addressing the same measure with opposite effect. We believe that this new aspect of performance is as important as the speed criterion. A variety of these learning systems are used as knowledge acquisition tools <ref> [Boose 89] </ref> as well. When these systems experience knowledge blindness it leads them to require more examples or additional knowledge to overcome this shortcoming. To require more examples or additional knowledge when not necessary has even a greater impact on their effectiveness as a knowledge acquisition tool. <p> EBL is a representative paradigm which is widely accepted as a knowledge base system that forms compiled formats (i.e. concepts) as a result of its learning. EBL is also known as a knowledge acquisition tool <ref> [Boose 89, Gaines 88] </ref>. The knowledge blindness effect found in EBL appears in similar systems that acquire compiled formats as their learning technique. The organization of this paper is as follows: three characteristics of compiled formats are presented to reason how knowledge blindness may occur.

Reference-contexts: This method does not guarantee correctness, but these integrity rules reduce the possibility of an error. FlexLearn over comes other problems in systems similar to EBL. For example, the problem of choosing the level of generality at which a concept should be learned <ref> [Braver 88, Dietterich 88] </ref> or the difficulty of adapting a concept to reflect new changes [Braver 88b]. Discussion on such issues is beyond the scope of this paper (see [Farag 89]). 5 A Measure for Flexibility In this section a measure of flexibility is presented. <p> Learning more concepts increases duplicated information and might slow the system down [Minton88, Mahadevan 88, Tambe88, Holder 90]. Another method for EBL like systems to increase their flexibility level is to increase their level of generality. This puts EBL back to the tradeoff between generality and operationality <ref> [Braver 88, Dietterich 88] </ref>. In some cases, generalizing predicates would not be possible without loss in correctness. For example, if the concept of cup is under consideration, then generalizing all bottoms to be stable would not be correct. A car with four wheel is considered stable.

Reference-contexts: In the categories, it finds the appropriate structural description for satisfying the conditions at hand. Thus, it recognizes the third instance of a cup. FlexLearn contain some mechanisms that are important in more complicated examples (for details see <ref> [Farag 89] </ref>). One mechanism is to capture and preserve connectivity or dependencies between predicates. FlexLearn has rules that maintain the integrity of selecting instances in one category with instances in another 5 category. These rules operate over the categories that store specific knowledge found in examples. <p> For example, the problem of choosing the level of generality at which a concept should be learned [Braver 88, Dietterich 88] or the difficulty of adapting a concept to reflect new changes [Braver 88b]. Discussion on such issues is beyond the scope of this paper (see <ref> [Farag 89] </ref>). 5 A Measure for Flexibility In this section a measure of flexibility is presented. The effect of flexibility on a learning system differ depending on system's architecture, generality of the predicate values, and the predicate connectivity.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to acquire knowledge to improve the system's performance over time. The compiled formats that these systems acquire for achieving their goal might have other effects on the system's performance. It has been noted <ref> [Minton88, Mahadevan 88, Tambe88, Holder 90] </ref> that the compiled formats may themselves degrade the systems performance. System performance has been understood, in this context, to be the ability to carry out a task faster on the second pass. In this paper we will address performance from a different aspect. <p> Unfortunately, learning more concepts does not increase its flexibility, it just eliminates the process of learning which would not have been required in case of F EBL = 1. Learning more concepts increases duplicated information and might slow the system down <ref> [Minton88, Mahadevan 88, Tambe88, Holder 90] </ref>. Another method for EBL like systems to increase their flexibility level is to increase their level of generality. This puts EBL back to the tradeoff between generality and operationality [Braver 88, Dietterich 88]. <p> It is also not clear with the increase in number of compiled formats in a system if their is a limit after which an architecture like FlexLearn would be faster <ref> [Mahadevan 88, Holder 90] </ref>. FlexLearn might experience loss of correctness in some cases. For example, if a handle in a cup fits a particular base only and there is no integrity rule for that, then FlexLearn falsely assume that this handle 7 can fit any cup base.
