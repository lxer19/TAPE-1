Abstract: Mobile manipulation capabilities are key to many new applications of robotics in space, underwater, construction, and service environments. This article discusses the ongoing effort at Stanford University for the development of multiple mobile manipulation systems and presents the basic models and methodologies for their analysis and control. This work builds on four methodologies we have previously developed for fixed-base manipulation: the Operational Space Formulation for task-oriented robot motion and force control; the Dextrous Dynamic Coordination of Macro/Mini structures for increased mechanical bandwidth of robot systems; the Augmented Object Model for the manipulation of objects in a robot system with multiple arms; and the Virtual Linkage Model for the characterization and control of internal forces in a multi-arm system. We present the extension of these methodologies to mobile manipulation systems and propose a new decentralized control structure for cooperative tasks. The article also discusses experimental results obtained with two holonomic mobile manipulation platforms we have designed and constructed at Stanford University.

Reference-contexts: The PUMA manipulator is equipped with a 6-axis force sensor on the wrist, and an electric two fingered gripper. The base consists of three "lateral" orthogonal universal-wheel assemblies which allow the base to translate and rotate holonomically in relatively flat office-like environments <ref> [9] </ref>. The base houses two Personal Computers, the motor amplifiers for both the base and arm, and batteries for approximately two hours of autonomous operation. In addition, a 1500 Watt AC power supply is included for tethered operations.
