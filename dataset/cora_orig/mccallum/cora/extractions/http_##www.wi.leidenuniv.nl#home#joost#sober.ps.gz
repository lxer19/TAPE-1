Abstract: We introduce observation frames as an extension of ordinary frames. The aim is to give an abstract representation of a mapping from observable predicates to all predicates of a specific system. A full subcategory of the category of observation frames is shown to be dual to the category of T 0 topological spaces. The notions we use generalize those in the adjunction between frames and topological spaces in the sense that we generalize finite meets to infinite ones. We also give a predicate logic of observation frames with both infinite conjunctions and disjunctions, just like there is a geometric logic for (ordinary) frames with infinite disjunctions but only finite conjunctions. This theory is then applied to two situations: firstly to upper power spaces, and secondly we restrict the adjunction between the categories of topological spaces and of observation frames in order to obtain dualities for various subcategories of T 0 spaces. These involve non sober spaces.

Liveness predicates can be seen as arbitrary (but according to [Smy83] only countable intersections should be considered) intersections of open sets. <p> The meet ^ corresponds to the logical "and" and the join _ corresponds to the logical "or". A complete lattice can be seen as being an (abstract) collection of predicates where equivalent predicates are identified. It is closed under arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions via V W . Following [Smy83], <ref> [Abr87] </ref> and also [Vic89] we see a frame as an (abstract) collection of finitely observable predicates where equivalent observations are identified. Finitely observable predicates are closed under arbitrary disjunctions and under finite conjunctions, represented by the arbitrary joins and finite meets.

Reference-contexts: Our framework of observation frames has both arbitrary unions and intersections of open sets. We use an abstract framework where open sets are just elements of a frame. A different approach has been followed by Kwiatkowska et al. in <ref> [AKM94] </ref>. In this approach liveness predicates can be interpreted as greatest fixed points of monotone operators on compact open sets.

Reference-contexts: Also if one wishes to study fairness or countable nondeterminism then it seems that one has to go beyond sober spaces: one has to consider a category of ! 0 and ! 1 chain complete partial orders with functions preserving least upper bounds of ! 1 chains [Plo82]. In <ref> [BK93] </ref> two of the authors introduced the notion of completely multiplicative predicate transformers. This notion was used in [BK94] for an extension of the results of Smyth [Smy83] from sober to T 0 spaces (considering also lower semi-continuous and Vietoris continuous mul-tifunctions in addition to the upper semi-continuous ones). <p> In section 4 we will see that a point satisfies a specification (i.e. a saturated element) if and only if it satisfies all the observable predicates which constitute such specification. Sometimes specifications of this kind are referred to as liveness predicates (see [Smy83], [Kwi91] and <ref> [BK93] </ref>). 7 Notice that for an observation frame F .!L, we have that q 2 Q (F .!L) if and only if q = ufa _ j a 2 F & q v a _ g. From right to left is clear.

Reference-contexts: In [BK93] two of the authors introduced the notion of completely multiplicative predicate transformers. This notion was used in <ref> [BK94] </ref> for an extension of the results of Smyth [Smy83] from sober to T 0 spaces (considering also lower semi-continuous and Vietoris continuous mul-tifunctions in addition to the upper semi-continuous ones). For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. <p> For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. This forms the basis for the investigation below. Usually subsets represent predicates and open sets <ref> [Smy83, Kwi91, BK94] </ref> represent observable predicates. In a more abstract view, a complete lattice represents predicates while a frame represents observable predicates. This leads us to introduce observation frames: they map observable predicates to arbitrary predicates. They are mappings from frames to complete lattices preserving arbitrary joins and finite meets. <p> We thus extend the definition of upper power space in [Smy83] from topological spaces to observation frames. The following three lemmas were partly present in <ref> [BK94] </ref>. They establish the fundamental role of M-filters in this setting. The first and fundamental step is that upper power spaces can also be described in terms of M-filters. Subsequently this correspondence is refined to compact and completely prime saturated elements. 5.1. Lemma. Let F .!L be an observation frame. <p> For a sober space X, there is an order isomor-phism between the the poset (KQ (X); U ) of compact saturated sets and the poset of Scott-open filters F O (X), ordered by inclusion. 2 The following result is a direct consequence of Lemma 5.5 and can be found in <ref> [BK94] </ref>. 5.7. Lemma. Let X be a sober space, Y be a topological space and : (X) ! (Y ) be a Scott continuous function.

Reference-contexts: Smyth realized that by this restriction the morphisms on the spatial frames are generalizations of predicate transformers in the sense of Dijkstra <ref> [Dij76, DS90] </ref>. There are interesting spaces which are not sober. For example posets taken with the Alexan-drov topology are not always sober. Johnstone shows [Joh81] that not every dcpo with the Scott topology is sober.

Reference-contexts: Core compact spaces are important because they are exponentiable in Sp [Isb75] (the converse also holds, as shown in <ref> [DK70] </ref>). Isbell [Isb75] gives an example of a core compact space which is not sober.

A poset L = (L; ) is a set together with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation on L. A poset which has meets (greatest lower bounds) for every pair of elements is a meet-semilattice. <p> The next definition and the subsequent proposition are standard and can be found for example in <ref> [GHK + 80, I, Definition 3.8 and Proposition 3.9] </ref>. 3.25. Definition. <p> We write CPos for the category of continuous dcpo's and continuous (directed join preserving) functions. These continuous dcpo's are considered with the Scott topology. There are then full and faithful functors CPos ! Sob ! Sp (for a proof that each continuous dcpo is sober, see e.g. <ref> [GHK + 80] </ref>). The sets " " x = fy 2 X j x t yg form a basis for the Scott-topology on a continuous dcpo X and a subset A X is open if and only if A = S x2A " " x. <p> Let x; y 2 L such that x 6 y. Since L is algebraic by <ref> [GHK + 80] </ref>[Theorem 4:22 (AC), page 93] there exists a completely irreducible element p 2 L such that x p but y 6 p. We need to prove now that p is M-prime. Let S L be such that p V S. <p> Therefore we can conclude by Corollary 6.7 that an algebraic complete lattice is completely distributive if and only if it is co-frame distributive. (ii) In <ref> [GHK + 80, JA94] </ref> is it shown that the category AlgCDFrm of algebraic completely distributive frames with frame morphisms is dual to the category AlgPos of algebraic dcpo's and Scott continuous functions. <p> Galois connections play an important role in spectral theory (see for example <ref> [GHK + 80] </ref>) and in general in lattice theory. In particular we are interested in those posets which constitute the frame part of an observation frame. <p> Any upper adjoint g preserves all meets in G, while any lower adjoint f preserves all joins in F . More generally we have the following characterization of Galois connections (cf. e.g. <ref> [GHK + 80, Corollary 0-3:5, Theorem 0-3:6] </ref>). 6.13. Lemma. <p> Also, the upper adjoint g preserves prime elements because preserves finite meets <ref> [GHK + 80, Lemma IV -4:5] </ref>. If : F ! G is also an observation frame morphism from F .!L to G.!H then we have the following. 6.14. Lemma. Let : (F .!L) ! (G.!H) be an observation frame morphism.
