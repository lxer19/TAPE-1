Abstract: I summarize the physics goals that motivate the construction of the PEP-II B-Factory and the BABAR detector and give a brief status report on the accelerator progress. I then describe the requirements for each of the detector systems and how the chosen design satisfies those requirements. Finally, I give projections for the physics performance.

Reference-contexts: This corresponds to an average separation of flfict = 250 m between the two B vertices, as shown in figure 1. 2 PEP-II The PEP-II B-Factory is being constructed by a collaboration of SLAC, LBL, and LLNL on the SLAC site. <ref> [1] </ref> There are going to be two storage rings in the PEP tunnel, a high energy ring (HER) for electrons and a low energy ring (LER) for positrons. The existing linac serves as an injector, and new bypass lines are being built for injection into the PEP-II rings.
