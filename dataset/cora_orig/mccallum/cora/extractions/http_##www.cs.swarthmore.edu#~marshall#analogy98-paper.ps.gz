Title: Making Sense of Analogies in Metacat  
Author: James B. Marshall Douglas R. Hofstadter 
Address: Bloomington, Indiana 47408 USA  
Affiliation: Indiana University  
Note: Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition  
Abstract: This paper outlines the main ideas and objectives of the Metacat project, an extension of the Copycat computer model of analogy-making and high-level perception. The principal features of Metacat that allow it to make sense of analogies suggested to it by the user are described using a simple example.

Reference-contexts: This type of self-awareness pervades human cognition. People can easily pay attention to patterns in their own thinking; see for example <ref> [Chi et al., 1989, VanLehn et al., 1992] </ref>. Once Metacat has the ability to size up the answers it finds in terms of their essential features, it ought to be able to evaluate other answers suggested to it by some outside agent.

Reference-contexts: The dynamic, "fluid" nature of Copycat's concepts is intended to model the extremely flexible human ability to perceive dissimilar things as being in fact "the same" when viewed at some appropriate level of description. A detailed exposition of the Copycat program can be found in [Mitchell, 1993] and <ref> [Hofstadter and FARG, 1995] </ref>. In this paper, we give just a brief summary of Copy 1 cat and then discuss in more detail recent work aimed at extending the model. <p> Metacat's Objectives Hofstadter has outlined several important objectives for the Metacat project <ref> [Hofstadter and FARG, 1995, Chapter 7] </ref>. First of all, the program should be able to explicitly characterize the essence of an answer|the core idea or cluster of ideas underlying the answer that fundamentally distinguishes it from other possible answers.
