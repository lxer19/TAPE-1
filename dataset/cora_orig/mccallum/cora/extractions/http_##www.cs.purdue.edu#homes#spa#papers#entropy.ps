Abstract: We investigate the basic question of information theory, namely, evaluation of Shannon entropy, and a more general Renyi entropy, for some discrete distributions (e.g., binomial, negative binomial, etc.). We aim at establishing analytic methods (i.e., those in which complex analysis plays a pivotal role) for such computations which often yield estimates of unparalleled precision. The main analytic tool used here is that of analytic poissonization and depoissonization. We illustrate our approach on the entropy evaluation of the binomial distribution, that is, we prove that for Binomial(n; p) distribution the entropy h n becomes h n 1 k1 a k n k where a k are explicitly computable constants. Moreover, we shall argue that analytic methods (e.g., complex asymptotics such as Rice's method and singularity analysis, Mellin transforms, poissonization and depoissonization) can offer new tools for information theory, especially for studying second-order asymptotics theory, therefore, we we coin the term analytic information theory for such investigations. Key Words: Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy, discrete distributions, analytic poissoniza-tion and depoissonization, formal power series, binomial sums. fl This work was partly supported by the Esprit Basic Research Action No. 7141 (Alcom II).

Reference-contexts: This turns out to be a good approach to some problems (of combinatorics, analysis of algorithms, applied probability, etc.) in which poissonization removes some "tricky statistical dependence" 3 (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>). Recently, analytic poissonization and depoissonization were used in the analysis of algorithms (e.g., [18, 24, 15, 28]), performance evaluation of Lempel-Ziv schemes (cf. [21, 22, 23, 14]), and we use it here to estimate the entropy. In fact, we extend the pois-sonization/depoissonization method in two directions.

In addition, g fl (s) is absolutely integrable on the line of the integration. <p> We expected to find such an extension in books (cf. <ref> [5] </ref> Chap. 11) but since we fail to provide a definite reference, we include here a brief discussion.

Reference-contexts: In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest and a few successful applications of analytic methods to a variety of problems on words (strings, sequences) that are at the core of information theory. Among others we mention here: analysis of Lempel-Ziv data compression schemes, (cf. <ref> [13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 23] </ref>), channel and source coding (cf. [19, 31, 32]); conflict resolution algorithms for multiaccess communications (cf. [6, 7, 25, 28, 30]); digital trees and their applications (cf. [12, 14, 15, 24, 29]); self-similar traffic with long-range dependence in computer networks (cf. [11]), and so forth. <p> Recently, analytic poissonization and depoissonization were used in the analysis of algorithms (e.g., [18, 24, 15, 28]), performance evaluation of Lempel-Ziv schemes (cf. <ref> [21, 22, 23, 14] </ref>), and we use it here to estimate the entropy. In fact, we extend the pois-sonization/depoissonization method in two directions. First of all, in Theorem 4 we show how to estimate asymptotically the Poisson transform without computing it explicitly (the situation that occurs quite often in practice).

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this goal we explore problems of information theory by analytic methods, that is, those in which complex analysis plays a pivotal role. As argued by Andrew Odlyzko <ref> [26] </ref>: "Analytic methods are extremely powerful and when they apply, they often yield estimates of unparalleled precision." Certainly, analytic methods were used before in information theory, notably in coding and signal processing. <p> 2 dy + o (n (!1)=2 )(4) 2 +" (2n 2 ) !=2 1 y 2 ! = p !1 2 +" + o (n (!1)=2 ) where (4) follows directly from the Euler-Maclaurin formula (cf.
