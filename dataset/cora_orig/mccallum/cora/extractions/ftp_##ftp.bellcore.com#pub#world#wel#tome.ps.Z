Abstract: All correspondence concerning this paper should be directed to Daniel V. Wilson or alternatively to Walter Willinger if Dan is not available. Abstract We demonstrate that Ethernet local area network (LAN) traffic is statistically self-similar, that none of the commonly used traffic models is able to capture this fractal behavior, that such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of high-speed, cell-based (B-ISDN) networks, and that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity ("burstiness") instead of smoothing it. Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements collected between 1989 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of the underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also consider some implications for congestion control in B-ISDN and present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes. Self-similar traffic models provide simple, accurate, and realistic descriptions of traffic scenarios encountered during B-ISDN deployment.

Reference-contexts: aggregate Ethernet LAN traffic is very different both from conventional telephone traffic and from currently considered formal models for packet traffic (e.g., pure Poisson or Poisson-related models such as Poisson-batch or Markov-Modulated Poisson processes (Heffes and Lucantoni (1986)), packet-train models (Jain and Routhier (1986)), fluid flow models (Anick et al. <ref> (1982) </ref>, etc.). As already observed in Ramaswami (1988), these differences require a new look at modeling traffic and performance of broadband networks. 1.4 OUTLINE OF THE PAPER The paper is organized as follows. <p> In fact, if bits or bytes are the preferred units, the renewal reward process source model resembles the popular class of fluid models (see Anick et al. <ref> (1982) </ref>). On the other hand, if we think of packets as the underlying unit of information, the renewal reward process is basically a packet train model in the sense of Jain and Routhier (1986). <p> The second method exploits a convergence result obtained by Granger (1980) who showed that when aggregating many simple AR (1)-processes, where the AR (1) parameters are chosen from a beta-distribution on <ref> [0, 1] </ref> with shape parameters p and q, then the superposition process is asymptotically self-similar; Granger also showed that the Hurst parameter H depends linearly on the shape parameter q of the beta-distribution.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS The main objectives of this paper are (i) to establish in a statistically rigorous manner the self-similarity characteristic or fractal nature of the high time-resolution Ethernet traffic measurements of Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref>, (ii) to illustrate some of the most striking differences between self-similar models and the standard models for packet traffic currently considered in the literature, and (iii) to demonstrate some of the serious implications of self-similar network traffic for the design, control, and performance analysis of high-speed, cell-based communications systems. <p> In this paper, we use very high quality, high time-resolution LAN traffic data collected by Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref>. Using a custom-built Ethernet monitor described in the next section of the paper, they were able to record hundreds of millions of Ethernet packets without loss (irrespective of the traffic load), and with recorded time-stamps accurate to within 100 ms. <p> The data were collected between August 1989 and February 1992 on several Ethernet LANs at the Bellcore Morristown Research and Engineering Center. Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> present a preliminary statistical analysis of this unique high-quality data and comment in detail on the presence of "burstiness" across an extremely wide range of time scales: traffic "spikes" ride on longer-term "ripples", that in turn ride on still longer term "swells", etc. <p> A longer discussion of the capabilities of the original monitoring system, including extensive testing of its capacity and accuracy can be found in Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref>. 2.1 THE TRAFFIC MONITOR There is a wide range of commercial and custom-built equipment available for monitoring or taking data from LANs. <p> The monitor was custom-built by one of the authors (Wilson) in 1987/88 and has been in use to the present day with one upgrade. The following paragraph describes the updated version of the monitor; the original version is described at length in Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref>. There is only one major difference between the two versions. The heart of the monitor is a 68030 microprocessor-based single board computer (SBC) with on-board Ethernet hardware that is used as a high performance Ethernet interface. <p> These constructions are of practical interest since they provide an intuitive explanation for the occurrence of self-similarity in high-speed network traffic (see Section 5.1). A rather different construction of self-similar processes as limits of integrated shot noise processes is discussed in Giraitis and Surgailis <ref> (1991) </ref>; however, its interpretation in the context of telecommunication systems is less obvious. 3.3 PROPERTIES OF SELF-SIMILAR PROCESSES 3.3.1 LONG-RANG DEPENDENCE AND THE HURST EFFECT A stochastic process satisfying relation (3.1.1) is said to exhibit long-range dependence (see, for example, Beran (1992), Cox (1984), Kuensch (1986), or Taqqu (1987)). <p> Heuristically, long-range dependence manifests itself in the presence of cycles of all frequencies and orders of magnitude, displays features suggestive of nonstationarity, and has been found to be relevant in economics (Lo <ref> (1991) </ref>, Mandelbrot (1969), Sowell (1990)), in hydrology and geology (Mandelbrot and Van Ness (1968), Mandelbrot and Wallis (1969a, 1969b)), and in telecommunication (Mandelbrot (1965), Beran et al. (1992)) see also Beran (1992), Cox (1984), Hampel (1987), and Taqqu (1985) and the references therein. <p> While the distinction between currently proposed packet traffic models and actual packet traffic measurements from such applications as Ethernet LANs, VBR video codecs (see Beran et al. (1992)), and an ISDN office automation (see Meier-Hellstern et al. <ref> (1991) </ref>) is obvious from a statistical perspective, potential traffic engineering implications of this distinction are currently under intense scrutiny. <p> However, evidence in support of the infinite variance syndrome in packet traffic measurements already exists. For example, in a recent study of traffic measurements from an ISDN office automation application, Meier-Hellstern et al. <ref> (1991) </ref> observed that the extreme variability in the data (e.g., interarrival times of packets, number of successive packet arrivals in certain states) cannot be adequately captured using traditional packet traffic models but, instead, seems to be best described with the help of heavy-tailed distributions of the form (3.2.3). <p> A commonly used measure for capturing the variability of traffic over different time scales is provided by the index of dispersion (for counts) and has recently attracted considerable attention (e.g., Heffes and Lucantoni (1986), Sriram and Whitt (1986), Fendick et al. <ref> (1991) </ref>). For a given time interval of length L, the index of dispersion for counts (IDC) is given by the variance of the number of arrivals during the interval of length L divided by the expected value of that same quantity. <p> Compared to the closely related variance-time plot method, plotting the IDC curve and estimating its slope provides a quick and simple engineering-based approach to testing for self-similarity of a set of traffic measurements. Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> have pointed out the problem with using the peak-to-mean ratio as a measure for "burstiness" in the presence of self-similar traffic. <p> Our discussion below follows closely Fowler and Leland <ref> (1991) </ref>, and Leland and Wilson (1991), who use long segments of actual Ethernet traffic measurements for their trace-driven simulations. <p> Our discussion below follows closely Fowler and Leland <ref> (1991) </ref>, and Leland and Wilson (1991), who use long segments of actual Ethernet traffic measurements for their trace-driven simulations. <p> In light of the same fractal-like behavior of VBR video traffic (see Beran et al. (1992)), their conclusions are likely to apply also to a more heterogeneous B-ISDN traffic environment. While Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> employ the Ethernet data in a trace-driven simulation of a LAN/B-ISDN interface proposed for SMDS and thus, shed light on the problem of designing and sizing of network access controllers, Fowler and Leland (1991) use the data for modeling the offered traffic of a connectionless service that provides LAN interconnections <p> While Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> employ the Ethernet data in a trace-driven simulation of a LAN/B-ISDN interface proposed for SMDS and thus, shed light on the problem of designing and sizing of network access controllers, Fowler and Leland (1991) use the data for modeling the offered traffic of a connectionless service that provides LAN interconnections and show subsequently, what congestion might look like in a B-ISDN environment. <p> Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> consider the access class scheme proposed for SMDS on public B-ISDN. SMDS is a connectionless data service with interfaces that split the variable length Ethernet packets into fixed-sized cells at the access point and reassemble the packets at the egress point. <p> However, both packet loss and delay behaviors differ drastically between trace-driven simulations based on the actual traffic measurements and those based on these formal traffic models and indicate that the proposed quality of service requirements might be hard to meet for realistic traffic scenarios. In particular, Leland and Wilson <ref> (1991) </ref> observe that overall packet loss decreases very slowly with increasing buffer capacity, in sharp contrast to Poisson-based models where losses decrease exponentially fast with increasing buffer size. <p> To this end, Fowler and Leland <ref> (1991) </ref> simulate a simple network that provides LAN interconnection. The switches within the network are assumed to be perfect output queueing switches and to provide connectionless transport for packets of varying length which, in turn, are composed of fixed-length, 53-octet cells. <p> In order to know what actions to take for congestion recovery, it is essential to know "How long does congestion typically persist?", and "What patterns of loss (or delay) occur during congestion?" The main lessons learned from Fowler and Leland's <ref> (1991) </ref> simulation study are: (i) There exists large variation in network traffic on time scales of hours, days, or months; while this aggravates careful sizing of network components, small errors in engineering can incur drastic penalties in loss or delay. (ii) Although some of the standard traffic models suggest that congestion <p> In view of our analysis in Section 4 of Ethernet traces similar to the ones used by Fowler and Leland <ref> (1991) </ref>, lessons (i)-(iv) are readily explained by the self-similar or fractal nature of the traffic used in the simulation (see Section 5.3.1 above). <p> Below, we mention two very promising approaches in order to deal with fractal properties of packet traffic, i.e., with properties such as self-similarity (see Section 4), long-range-dependence (see Beran et al. (1992)), infinite variances (see Meier-Hellstern et al. <ref> (1991) </ref>), and fractal dimensions (see Erramilli and Singh (1992)) observed in actual packet traffic measurements. The two approaches are (i) stochastic models based on self-similar processes and (ii) deterministic models using nonlinear chaotic maps. <p> other hand, the inference part for dynamical systems, i.e., deriving an appropriate nonlinear chaotic map based on a set of actual traffic measurements, currently requires considerable guessing and experimenting; developing more rigorous statistical estimation methods for dynamical systems has recently attracted considerable attention in the statistics literature (e.g., see Casdagli <ref> (1991) </ref>, Smith (1991), Berliner (1992), and Chatterjee and Yilmaz (1992), and references therein). Note that the motivation for both approaches, self-similar stochastic modeling and deterministic non-linear modeling, is the desire for a relatively simple description of the complex packet traffic generation process. <p> the inference part for dynamical systems, i.e., deriving an appropriate nonlinear chaotic map based on a set of actual traffic measurements, currently requires considerable guessing and experimenting; developing more rigorous statistical estimation methods for dynamical systems has recently attracted considerable attention in the statistics literature (e.g., see Casdagli <ref> (1991) </ref>, Smith (1991), Berliner (1992), and Chatterjee and Yilmaz (1992), and references therein).
