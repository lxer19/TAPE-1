Reference-contexts: The variable y is the spanwise coordinate. The bottom evolution obeys the mass transport relation, Eq. (2). A full description of the model appears in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. Owing to the widely discrepant time scales between the (fast) evolution of the water waves and the (slow) bottom topography, this coupled system may be solved iteratively: Given an initial bottom configuration H (x; y), we seek a solution to the 4 water waves using Eq.

The mass transport equation is implemented by using a standard Lax-Wendroff scheme, while the surface system was discretized using a Douglas scheme for the linear part and iterative correction for the nonlinear terms.

Reference-contexts: Since this technique is very well established <ref> [3] </ref>, we shall not report on such standard issues as consistency, convergence, and uniqueness. Equation (2) is approximated by the following computational module: h r+1=2 = 4 T x + 2y h n+1 j + x T ffi yT (4) 6 fi T .

Reference-contexts: The two-dimensional case has been considered in detail by Bona et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. We adopt the same computational scheme and rely on their confidence in the method to enable us to use its results for comparison in the three-dimensional case. <p> The details on the applicability of such a scheme to the solution of Eq. (11) appear in <ref> [4] </ref>. 9 3.2 Numerical Solution of the Three-Dimensional Case For the surface equations in the three-dimensional case, Eq.

From top to bottom, a = 0:4, 0:2, 0:1, 0:05, respectively. accuracy and error of the scheme, we compared the outcome of the numerical solution with the exact solution of this special case <ref> [5] </ref>, which, in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions "sn," are v 2 (~x) = v 2 b v 2 c v 2 w 2 (~x) = 1 v 2 (~x): (55) The quantity ~x 0 is determined by the boundary condition y 2 (0), and the value of fl is related <p> Two types of trials were carried out, both using a flat bottom. In the three-dimensional trial we assumed the boundary conditions were A 1 = 0:5 + 0:01y and A 2 = 0:1 + 0:01y and monitored the conserved Hamiltonian <ref> [5] </ref> along the length in the x direction, midway in the spanwise direction. In the two-dimensional trial, we set A 1 = 0:5 and A 2 = 0:1 and monitored the same quantity along the ray.

Reference-contexts: The exact solution O 0 , was computed using the algorithm given in <ref> [6] </ref>, p. 189. The error as a function of grid size is plotted in Figure 3, from which one can conclude that the scheme is in fact fourth-order accurate and consistent.
