Abstract: In present-day cashless payment systems, the banks and (by installing a Trojan Horse) even the manufacturers of the computer equipment used could easily observe who pays what amount to whom and when. With the increasing digitization of these systems, e.g. point-of-sale terminals and home banking, the amount of transaction data and their computerization drastically increases. Therefore these payment systems become completely unacceptable, since compiling dossiers on the lifestyle and whereabouts of all clients will become easy. We describe the digital payment systems enabling unobservability of clients and arrange them in a general model to compare their different degrees of unobservability and their different levels of security. Since no single system has all desired features, we propose a suitable synthesis.

Reference-contexts: However, in lieu of special banking forms and handwritten signatures, digitally signed messages (in standard formats) are used. The bank signs messages digitally as well, which can be verified by every party in the system. A complete description is given in ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 We don't recommend to base "verification" on the identifiability of cheaters, as is done in ref. [9]. <p> is established in a weak form, it suffices to avoid generating an audit trail within the chipcard, or if an audit trail has to be maintained for security reasons, to make it unintelligible for banks without the cooperation of the chipcard's holder. 12 A complete description is given in ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> By definition of a one-way-function, it is impossible to compute the precursor out of the note number efficiently. Another method offering more flexibility applies digital signatures linked to digital pseudonyms <ref> [3] </ref>. The following protocol shows withdrawal, payment and deposit of a digital banknote. This is an extended version of Chaum's original and still unpublished bank-proof payer anonymity protocol [7]. The extension is necessary to use this payment system for payments between two remote and anonymous parties. <p> (n * ) r = d B ([1.5])" [2.4] B - d B (n * ) r -&gt; X [2.5] B - "STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT" -&gt; X Note: The procedure in step [2.3] describes the bank's "blind signature" as explained in the preliminary remark at the begin of the protocol. <ref> [3] </ref> X removes the blinding factor and checks whether he has received a valid banknote or not: [3.1] X : d B (n * ) := [2.4] r -1 [4] X transfers the note to Y: [4.1] X - d B (n * ) -&gt; Y [5] Y checks the signature <p> message received in step [1.1] and gives order to the bank to register auth y , the randomly chosen digital pseudonym of Y, as new owner: [2.1] X : auth yx ([1.1]) [2.2] X - sign x ("REGISTER auth y AS CURRENT OWNER OF v n ") -&gt; B 19 <ref> [3] </ref> The bank checks the authentication of the transfer order received in step [2.2] and executes it: [3.1] B : auth x ([2.2]) [3.2] B : "insert auth x and [2.2] in the list of former owners of v n " [3.3] B : "register auth y as current owner of <p> The expense of generating a new pair of operators for each transfer of an anonymously transferable standard value can be saved by using arguments under a public one-way-function which are taken as the digital pseudonyms of the owners. The resulting impacts are described in ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. Obviously, this payment system provides both, relation anonymity and clearing anonymity, cf. figure 6. <p> A comparison of anonymously transferable standard values and blindly signed digital banknotes with respect to unobservability, security, and expense is given in ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. 21 It is clear from section 3.1 that it is appropriate to unite the system realizing anonymity cut 2 only (anonymous numbered accounts) with the one realizing anonymity cut 3 only (blindly signed digital banknotes) to get both relation and clearing anonymity.

Reference-contexts: In order to guarantee anonymity of individuals, a digital signature must not be associated with an individual directly but with a digital pseudonym <ref> [4, 6] </ref> which is used by that individual. Digital pseudonyms are just (almost unique) numbers (or pairs thereof) which are created by individuals through a special random process. It is assumed that every individual uses different digital pseudonyms wherever possible to restrict linkability to a minimum. <p> Granted authentication is applied in those cases when a declaration can be made only when an authorization from another (e.g. superior) instance can be shown. These authorizations or credentials should be issued to digital pseudonyms, not directly to the individuals. Special measures <ref> [6] </ref> can prevent the third parties (e.g. banks) which grant authentication from deriving undesired concatenations, even in cooperation with those to whom the credentials are shown. 4 In the following we assume that networks without user observability are used. <p> Measures to tolerate even complete failures or losses of chipcards taking into account not only security but also unobservability are described in refs. [25] and [26]. 4 . 3 Blindly Signed Digital Banknotes Next, we describe a payment system invented by Chaum <ref> [5, 6] </ref> realizing anonymity cut 3 only, i.e. independently whether anonymity cuts 1 and 2 are realized or not. This payment system establishes clearing anonymity by unobservability of each currency with itself, cf. section 3.2. <p> This will be used to prevent reservation of fake notes for deposit (cf. step <ref> [6] </ref> of the protocol). r is a random "blinding factor" which disables the bank to recognize the note number n * whilst signing it.

[6.4] B : "register n * as reserved for Y until t" [6.5] B - sign <p> To unlink the two transactions described above, clients should be able to change the identity of their digital pseudonyms known to the bank the same way as they can with blindly signed digital banknotes. This can be done by using the same special measure <ref> [6] </ref> which is applied to hinder the credentials-issuing organizations from deriving undesired concatenations (cf. section 2.2) and which is based on blind signatures as well. 5 . 2 Combinations Enabling Offline Payments Even Without Absolutely Tamper-Resistant Devices Obviously, the usability of digital payment systems increases when they can be used not

Reference-contexts: By decrypting it, he can establish clearing anonymity (independently whether he is payer or payee), even against a coalition of the other and the bank. Clearly, the protocols for a payment vary slightly depending on who encrypts and later decrypts the banknote <ref> [7] </ref>. To allow payer and payee to verify clearing anonymity, both parties have to encrypt and later decrypt the banknote. 2 In the following, we will only consider in detail the variation, where the payer encrypts the note number. Therefore, it seems appropriate to outline the other variations. <p> Another method offering more flexibility applies digital signatures linked to digital pseudonyms [3]. The following protocol shows withdrawal, payment and deposit of a digital banknote. This is an extended version of Chaum's original and still unpublished bank-proof payer anonymity protocol <ref> [7] </ref>. The extension is necessary to use this payment system for payments between two remote and anonymous parties. The substantial improvements are the introduction of an expiry date for each reservation and receipts of payments. <p> The specification of Y in step [6.5] may be any digital pseudonym of Y, e.g. the digital pseudonym under which Y is known to the bank as holder of an anonymous numbered account. <ref> [7] </ref> Y checks the confirmation of reservation received in step [6.5] and forwards it to X: [7.1] Y : auth B ([6.5]) [7.2] Y - [6.5] -&gt; X [8] X checks the confirmation of reservation received from Y in step [7.2] and sends Y the precursor to the note number: [8.1] <p> Special methods even allow accrual of interest for digital banknotes <ref> [7] </ref>. 23 6 Required Future Action Of course the existence of a payment system enabling unobservability does not necessarily mean that it must be used for all kinds of payments. Each client can determine for himself how much unobservability of his payments he wishes, unless there are restrictions by law.

Reference-contexts: Coding only. The security of both methods (as of seemingly all other digital payment systems, also those not enabling unobservability) depends on cryptography, though unfortunately as yet the security of cryptosystems cannot be proved from scratch. The first method additionally uses tamper-resistant devices <ref> [12] </ref> (e.g. chipcards) where the digitally transferable currencies are stored. However, the existence of appropriate devices is admittedly questionable, since they must be trusted by mutually suspicious groups, so that the same, but to some 9 extent reverse problematic arising when banks realize anonymity cut 3, is present. <p> He never has to identify himself since he randomly chooses a digital pseudonym (cf. section 2.2) which is made known to the bank in order that the bank can subsequently use it to authenticate his messages.

The bank signs messages digitally as well, which can be verified by every party in the system. <p> The problem to form messages which contain secret information is one of the basic problems of cryptography and can be solved in various ways. The method applied in this case uses a public one-way-function f <ref> [12] </ref>. The note numbers are of the form f (x) completed by redundancy. The argument x is known to the payer only and is called precursor to f (x) and to the resulting note number.

Reference-contexts: To hide these traffic data too, the relation between sender and recipient must be kept secret (unlinkability), or more secure, both sender and recipient of a message are kept secret. A survey on measures to hide traffic data in a network is given in ref. <ref> [20] </ref>. 2 . 2 Authentication New applications of networks like digital payment systems require elaborate measures for authentication, e.g. transmitted messages may be legally binding declarations which are effective only if a proof of authorization is shown.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that every individual uses different digital pseudonyms wherever possible to restrict linkability to a minimum. There are two forms of authentication which should be distinguished: self-authentication and granted authentication <ref> [21] </ref>. The form of authentication when someone refers to previous declarations of his own is called self-authentication. This form corresponds to one's handwritten signature. <p> Before these payment systems and other appropriate anonymous transaction protocols can be used in practice, the legal framework has to be adapted appropriately <ref> [21] </ref>. But this would be necessary for any digital payment and transaction system anyway. Today the state bears the full risk of the cash system without installing a nearly perfect supervision and control system encircling everyone everywhere.

Reference-contexts: The circumstance that great frauds were rare (or at least not reported) up to now and could have been covered by insurance <ref> [22] </ref>, together with the missing awareness of the clients that their privacy is extremely endangered by these systems (and cannot be covered by any insurance) should not induce anybody to hold on to inadequate payment systems.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the Trojan Horse in the first tool may be implanted by another tool used to generate the first one and so on. An example for this technically unavoidable possibility is given by Thompson <ref> [23] </ref>. The more general attack by a virus as described by Cohen [10] can be restricted to the one just described by signing programs digitally, as proposed for slightly other reasons in p.317 of ref. [13], and checking the signature before execution.

Reference-contexts: For this, it is not sufficient to hide only the content of a message, which can be done by end-to-end-encryption <ref> [24] </ref>, since an attacker could still see who sends how many messages to whom and at what time (traffic analysis). To hide these traffic data too, the relation between sender and recipient must be kept secret (unlinkability), or more secure, both sender and recipient of a message are kept secret.
