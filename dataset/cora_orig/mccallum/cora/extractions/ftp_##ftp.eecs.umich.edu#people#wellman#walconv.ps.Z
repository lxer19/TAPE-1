Abstract: The walras algorithm calculates competitive equilibria via a distributed tatonnement-like process, in which agents submit single-good demand functions to market-clearing auctions. The algorithm is asynchronous and decentralized with respect to both agents and markets, making it suitable for distributed implementation. We present a formal description of this algorithm, and prove that it converges under the standard assumption of gross substitutability. We relate our results to the literature on general equilibrium stability and some more recent work on decentralized algorithms. We present some experimental results as well, particularly for cases where the assumptions required to guarantee convergence do not hold. Finally, we consider some extensions and generalizations to the walras algorithm.

Reference-contexts: an equilibrium. (Often this process is formalized as a continuous rather than a discrete adjustment, so that it can be described by differential equations and Lyapunov methods applied to prove stability results.) This particular formulation of tatonnement, along with some minor variants, was extensively studied in the 1950s and 1960s <ref> (Arrow & Hahn 1971) </ref>. The results most relevant in our computational context are those on global stability. Of particular importance is the demonstration by Arrow, et al. (1959) that gross substitutability (GS) is sufficient for a tatonnement process to be globally stable.

Reference-contexts: Many other protocols are possible, as realized, for example, in particular artificial economies (Clearwater 1995; Epstein & Axtell 1996; Yamaki, Wellman, & Ishida 1996), or general dynamic exchange mechanisms such as continuous double auctions <ref> (Friedman & Rust 1993) </ref>. If one is interested in general equilibrium for purposes of implementing decentralized resource allocation, then the objection that tatonnement is not an accurate description of observed price-formation processes is not crucial.

Reference-contexts: These are essentially partial equilibrium models which could be reformulated as quadratic programming problems, as pointed out by the authors. Walras uses this method to approach a collection of markets which are inherently interdependent. The progressive equilibration approach also bears some similarity to Hicks's notion of perfect stability <ref> (Hicks 1948) </ref>, which itself is patterned more after Walras's tatonnement concept than are more modern formalizations. Reiter and Simon (1992) studied a decentralized approach for the case where the equations that describe the equilibrium are linear. For this special case, their method requires a particularly small message space.

Reference-contexts: Notes on Aggregate Demand Functions While the experimental results are certainly encouraging, formal results establishing convergence under a class of utility functions wider than GS is still out of reach at this time. That this is difficult is perhaps not surprising. The Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu (SMD) theorem <ref> (Shafer & Sonnenschein 1982) </ref> tells us that utility maximization by each individual agent does not impose any restriction on the aggregate demand function.

Reference-contexts: Strategic Complementarity The assumption of gross substitutability serves three purposes in our argument. First, it guarantees the uniqueness of competitive equilibrium <ref> (Varian 1992) </ref>. Sec ond, it ensures that the price sequences fa j (t)g and fb j (t)g are consistent with adaptive learning. Third, it establishes that the price-setting game exhibits strategic complementarity (Milgrom & Shannon 1994). DEFINITION 7.

Reference-contexts: One virtue of introducing asynchrony into the price adjustment process is that it tends to reduce price oscillations caused by simultaneous reactions by agents to the same delayed information <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>. By randomizing the bidding, different agents tend to bid on different goods in a given period. <p> It is of course also decentralized at the agent level, as agents are concerned exclusively with their own consumption or production. Both forms of decentralization are useful (often essential) in practice, providing the two sources of distributivity and modularity in the system (Wellman 1995). As we have previously <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> pointed out, walras differs from the traditional tatonnement procedure in two basic ways: 1. Agents send excess demand functions rather than single quantity points at a particular price, and 2. the auction adjusts individual prices to clear each market, rather than just adjusting the whole price vector incrementally. <p> They have applied such results to problems in dynamic programming, network flow, and constrained optimization. Some other related work is described in previous writings <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>. 3. Convergence of the Walras Algorithm In this section, we show that the price adjustment process generated by walras converges to the unique competitive equilibrium, under conditions of an exchange economy with strictly convex preferences and gross substitutability (GS) between goods.

Reference-contexts: Convergence continues rapidly in the early iterations (a constant slope on the log-scale plot), beginning to level off at around 150 cycles. We have also examined scalability of the algorithm with respect to the numbers of goods and agents <ref> (Wellman 1995) </ref>. The main experimental evidence seems to suggest that the number of iterations required to reach equilibrium does not rise with the number of agents in the economy. We have also observed manageable increases in convergence time with up to a dozen goods (see (Wellman 1995, Figure 2)). <p> The main experimental evidence seems to suggest that the number of iterations required to reach equilibrium does not rise with the number of agents in the economy. We have also observed manageable increases in convergence time with up to a dozen goods (see <ref> (Wellman 1995, Figure 2) </ref>). To calculate the clearing price for any particular market, we have generally used binary search over the aggregate demand function. <p> It is of course also decentralized at the agent level, as agents are concerned exclusively with their own consumption or production.
