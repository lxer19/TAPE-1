Abstract: MA cpollett@aleph0.clarku.bu.edu The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between I 0 +exp and its weaker subtheories. We give a method of translating certain classes of I 0 +exp proofs into weaker systems of arithmetic such as Buss' systems S 2 . We show if IE i (exp) ` A with a proof P of expind-rank(P ) n + 1 where all (8 : right) or (9 : left) have bounding terms not containing function symbols then S i 2 IE i;2 ` A n . Here A is not necessarily a bounded formula. For IOpen(exp) we prove a similar result. Using our translations we show IOpen(exp) ( I 0 (exp). Here

Reference-contexts: U i+1 -formula) whose innermost quantifier is sharply bounded. 3 Next we define BASIC k to be a finite set of quantifier free axioms for the non-logical symbols of L k . These axioms are listed in Buss <ref> [2] </ref> with the exception of the axioms for M SP and : which are listed in Takeuti [14]. We will take BASIC 1 to be the L 1 -theory axiomatized by BASIC 2 less the axioms not in L 1 . <p> We will formalize BASIC and XBASIC proofs in the system LKB of Buss <ref> [2] </ref> where we have equality axioms and take axioms of BASIC (XBASIC) as initial sequent. The main point of LKB is it treats bounded quantifiers syntactically. We define stronger theories by adding various types of induction rules to BASIC and XBASIC. <p> The above axiomatization of S i 2 was given in Pollett [11] and shown to be equivalent to the original one given in Buss <ref> [2] </ref>. It is straightforward to show that the axioms added to make XBASIC k are provable in the theory BASIC+open-LIND and so are available to S 1 2 [11].Thus, S k = [ i IE fidg i;k . <p> We write IE fidg i;k as IE i;k and write IE i;k as just IE i if the language is understood. The next two results are from Pollett [11] (The first of these can be found in Buss <ref> [2] </ref>). Theorem 6 Let be closed under term substitution. Let : denote negations of formulas in . Then BASIC+-IN D t is equivalent to BASIC+:-IN D t . Theorem 7 Let be closed under (8x t). <p> n ; ~ B n (d); n ! n from which the lower sequent above follows by an (9 : left) inference. 2 We would like to specifically mention at this point what this result means for the well studied theories T i 2 and S i 2 of Buss <ref> [2] </ref>. Corollary 12 Suppose IE i (exp) ` A with LKB-proof P . Further suppose all bounding terms t in (8 : right) or (9 : left) inferences in P do not involve function symbols. Let n := max (exp-rank (P ); expind-rank (P ) + 1). <p> A free cut is a cut on a formula B which is not directly descended from an axiom or a principle formula in an induction inference. A proof is free-cut free if it does not have a free-cut. It is a result of Buss <ref> [2] </ref> that since all of IOpen (exp)'s axioms are open and since the open-IND rule involves only open principle formulas, any IOpen (exp) proof of an open-formula will contain only open formulas. Theorem 13 Suppose IOpen (exp) ` A an open-formula with free-cut free proof P . <p> The reader is invited to consult Buss <ref> [2] </ref>, Hajek and Pudlak [7], or Buss [3] for details on how this may be 9 carried out. We write T hmF CF T ( d e ) for the formula which says " codes a formula which is a free-cut free theorem of theory T ". <p> We write F CF Con (T ) for the formula :T hmF CF T ( d 0 = 1 e ). It follows from Theorem 10 on page 144 of Buss <ref> [2] </ref> that I 0 +exp does not prove F CF Con (I 0 +exp). On the other hand, we will show below I 0 +exp does prove F CF Con (IOpen (exp)). Lemma 14 I 0 +exp proves F CF Con (IOpen 2 ). PROOF.

Reference-contexts: We would like to point out that I 0 is usually defined in the language without : , b 1 2 xc, jxj, and M SP ; however, since these functions are all 0 -definable in the usual I 0 <ref> [3] </ref>, our theory will be a conservative extension of that theory. We frequently consider the following monotonic functions ! 1 := x log y , ! k+1 := 2 ! k (log x;log y) , and exp (x; y) := x y . <p> The reader is invited to consult Buss [2], Hajek and Pudlak [7], or Buss <ref> [3] </ref> for details on how this may be 9 carried out. We write T hmF CF T ( d e ) for the formula which says " codes a formula which is a free-cut free theorem of theory T ".

Reference-contexts: Here 2 x k is a stack of 2's k high with an x at the top. This result has both a simple compactness argument proof [7] as well as a proof using Herbrand's theorem <ref> [4] </ref> which could in principle be used to give a bound on k in terms of the maximum nesting depths of exp in the I 0 +exp proof. Intuitively, this result says: given x, if I 0 knows a big enough y exists then it can show A (x) holds.

Reference-contexts: Given this function I 0 +exp can define a function which translates an IOpen+exp proof P of A into an IOpen proof of A n for this n. To see this recall the folklore result <ref> [5] </ref> that I 0 +exp can 0 -define any elementary function. In this case, the case the proof of Theorem 13 gives a translation which can be computed in polynomial time. Notice for any n our translation has (0 = 1) n := (0 = 1).

Reference-contexts: It is also known to be both finitely axiomatized [15] and equivalent to its IE 1 +exp fragment <ref> [8] </ref>. In contrast the bounded arithmetic theories I 0 and I 0 + k (equivalent to Buss' S k+1 ), which have induction on formulas involving only sub-exponential growth rate functions are not known to prove the MRDP or known to be finitely axiomatized. <p> We write IOpen (exp), IE i (exp), and I 0 (exp) are the theories BASIC (exp)+open-IND, BASIC (exp)+E i IN D, and BASIC (exp)+ 0 IN D respectively. We state without proof the next theorem which is a result of Kaye <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 9 I 0 (exp) = IE 1 (exp) is a conservative extension of I 0 +exp. We mention here that the relationship between IOpen+exp and IOpen (exp) is unclear. This is because the exp-axiom is not an open-formula so IOpen+exp 6 does not have induction for it.

Reference-contexts: The reason why we are interested in such weak theories is that recently it has been shown that when m 4 these theories cannot prove the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy <ref> [10] </ref>. It is hoped one can look at I 0 +exp proofs of interesting mathematics and translate them into as strong as possible a result in the weaker theory. This would give some bite to the fact these theories cannot prove the collapse of the hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: We use this to prove I 0 (exp) proves F CF Con (IOpen (exp)). Since I 0 (exp) does not prove its own free-cut-free consistency this gives the result. Shepherdson <ref> [13] </ref> has noted that IOpen (exp) can prove the irrationality of p 2, which is not provable in IOpen. This indicates IOpen (exp) may be substantially stronger than IOpen which has recursive models. As far as the author knows it is still open if IOpen (exp) has recursive models.
