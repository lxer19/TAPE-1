Abstract: We investigate the importance of understanding traffic characteristics for Call Admission Control (CAC) policies in an ATM network. We are particularly interested in whether it pays off to characterize traffic on more than one time scale. Specifically, we compare the network utilization that could be achieved with complete knowledge of traffic characteristics, against the utilization achieved with an admission policy based on traffic knowledge on only one time scale.

Reference-contexts: The optimal network CAC policy will depend on how well we know these parameters. Traffic may be described in many ways, but a natural approach is to describe the random amounts of traffic generated in various intervals <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [4], [5]. No engineer is likely to know in detail all the joint distributions of all these random amounts, but some of the less complex statistics are likely to be available.

Reference-contexts: Video Traffic: The video-conference trace was the source of "real data" of a teleconference showing talking heads and shoulders, used in <ref> [3] </ref>. The trace lists the number of 64-octet cells in each of approximately 48,500 frames. It corresponds to approximately 30 minutes of a video at 24 frames/second.
