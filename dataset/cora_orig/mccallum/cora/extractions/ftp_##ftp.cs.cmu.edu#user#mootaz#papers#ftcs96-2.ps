Abstract: The DCE standard includes specifications for the Directory Service, a component that performs typical naming services in distributed computing environments. We list some deficiencies in these specifications that affect the naming service availability and correctness, and suggest possible solutions. We then describe an enhancement of an implementation of the Directory Service that adds support for partial replication of the name space, continuous operation of the service, and automatic failover. Our extensions ensure the consistency of the name space data, and are transparent to application developers and end users, all without a significant performance penalty.

Reference-contexts: CDS relies heavily on client caching to reduce server load. The performance and availability of CDS is crucial to applications built using DCE. To address these requirements, CDS names may be replicated on different servers. The replication model follows the primary copy approach <ref> [1] </ref>. The unit of replication is a directory, but subdirectories of a replicated directory are not automatically replicated. One physical copy of a directory is designated a master replica, while the others are designated read-only replicas. Updates can only be made to the master replica.

We focus in this paper on our experience with DCEs naming support. DCE provides a distributed and replicated Directory Service which implements a hierarchical name space that can be used for a variety of purposes.
