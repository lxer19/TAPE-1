Abstract: words, for the same delay requirement, our solutions consume less power. For example, for the MCM 9-pin net, a delay of 20ns can be achieved with a 5-stage cascaded drivers and a power dissipation of 31mW if wiresizing is used. However, for minimum-width interconnect, a 6-stage cascaded drivers and a power dissipation of &gt; 35mW is required to meet the similar requirement. 2. Our simultaneous driving sizing and wiresizing approach can reduce the delay by up to 40% when compared to the conventional method of sizing drivers only with same amount of power dissipation. For example, in Figure 3(b), with the same amount of power dissipation of 15mW , our DWSA solution achieves a delay of only 3:8ns whereas the MIN solution has a delay of &gt; 6ns. 3. As indicated by the steep slope of the curve when the delay is small, there is a lower limit of delay achievable by driver sizing approach or simultaneous driver sizing and wiresizing approach. Near this limit, a substantial amount of power is required for an insignificant amount of reduction of signal delay. The advantage of our approach is that the limiting delay by DWSA algorithm is up to 44% lower than that of the conventional method of driver The results in this paper have shown convincingly that proper sizing of the wire segments in a routing tree can lead to significant reduction in the interconnect delay with fractional increase in the power dissipation. In high performance systems where long on-chip interconnect and chip-to-chip wires are common, our optimal wiresizing solutions allow smaller driver size and/or fewer number of cascaded drivers required to drive long interconnect. As a result, our driver sizing and wiresizing solutions provide a low power interconnect design for high performance circuits. In this work, driver sizing and wiresizing are done in two separate steps. We are in the process of developing an optimal or near-optimal algorithm to perform driver sizing and wiresizing simultaneously for both power and performance optimization. We are also developing an accurate analytical formulation of the relationship between power and delay. We would also like to generalize the driver sizing and wiresizing problem such that long interconnect lines can be segmented and interleaved with optimal size repeaters. As mentioned in Section 1, interconnect topology optimization is another effective approach to reduce signal delay. A long term goal is to include wiresizing, driver sizing and also interconnect topology in the formulation of the power and performance optimization problem.
