Title: Towards a Reduced Commitment, D-Theory Style TAG Parser

Abstract: Many traditional TAG parsers handle ambiguity by considering all of the possible choices as they unfold during parsing. In contrast, D-theory parsers cope with ambiguity by using underspecified descriptions of trees. This paper introduces a novel approach to parsing TAG, namely one that explores how D-theoretic notions may be applied to TAG parsing. Combining the D-theoretic approach to TAG parsing as we do here raises new issues and problems. D-theoretic underspecification is used as a novel approach in the context of TAG parsing for delaying attachment decisions. Conversely, the use of TAG reveals the need for additional types of underspecification that have not been considered so far in the D-theoretic framework. These include combining sets of trees into their underspecified equivalents as well as underspecifying combinations of trees. In this paper, we examine various issues that arise in this new approach to TAG parsing and present solutions to some of the problems. We also describe other issues which need to be resolved for this method of parsing to be implemented.

Reference-contexts: Recall that in the case of seeing the word "know," we underspecified the argument label because it was unavailable. Similarly, upon encountering the word "fruit" we underspecify the set of two elementary trees because only projection up to the N level is licensed. The method suggested by <ref> [Evans and Weir, 1997] </ref> can perhaps be used to coalesce these structures. 8 Conclusions and Future Work In this work, we consider parsing TAG using underspecified descriptions of trees featuring dominance and underspecified node labels. The prediction component of an Earley parser corresponds to our assertion of domination.

Reference-contexts: Second, this strategy typically corresponds to right association, as described in <ref> [Frazier, 1995] </ref>. Specifically, minimizing more recently created domination links first means that more recently added subtrees will be attached as low as possible.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, we explore a different style of parsing that copes with ambiguity through the underspecification of tree structures. This style of parsing deals with descriptions of trees instead of trees themselves. Notable examples of such parsers include [Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck, 1983], <ref> [Gorrell, 1995] </ref>, and [Sturt and Crocker, 1996]. We refer to these as D-theory parsers. Following them, we construct an underspecified representation that captures a set of parses for the input seen so far. The primitive of dominance is used in the descriptions that our parser manipulates. <p> Section 7 discusses the issue of combining a set elementary trees into a single representation. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 8. 2 Parsing Framework Our parser draws on typical characteristics of D-theoretic parsers, such as [Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck, 1983] and <ref> [Gorrell, 1995] </ref>. Such characteristics, as well as their relation to our parser, are discussed in this section.

Reference-contexts: A domination link connects the top and bottom quasi-nodes. The path from the root to the lexical anchor of an elementary tree will be called the trunk. We now define the terms component and lowering node. The notion of component is borrowed from D-Tree Grammars, as defined in <ref> [Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1995] </ref>. A component is a maximal subpart of an underspecified representation that has the property that all of its nodes are connected by immediate domination links. Consider ff 0 in Figure 1 for example.

An interior node is commonly considered to be constituted of a top and bottom feature structure. In contrast, we use the terminology introduced by <ref> [Vijay-Shanker, 1992] </ref> in that an interior node is considered as a pair of quasi-nodes. A domination link connects the top and bottom quasi-nodes. The path from the root to the lexical anchor of an elementary tree will be called the trunk. We now define the terms component and lowering node.
