Abstract: Most speech parameter estimation techniques are easily influenced by the frequency response of the communication channel. We have developed a technique that is more robust to such steady-state spectral factors in speech. The approach is conceptually simple and computationally efficient. The new method is described, and experimental results are reported, showing a significant advantage for the proposed method. fl US West Advanced Technologies, 4001 Discovery Drive, Boulder, CO 80303

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP) speech analysis technique <ref> [1] </ref> is based on the short-term spectrum of speech. <p> When the filtering is done in the logarithmic spectral domain, the suppressed constant spectral component reflect the effect of the convolutive factors in the input speech signal, introduced by frequency characteristics of the communication media. The steps of RASTA-PLP are as follows (see <ref> [1] </ref> for comparison to the conventional PLP method): For each analysis frame: 1) Compute the critical-band spectrum (as in the PLP) and take its logarithm. 2) Estimate the temporal derivative of the log critical-band spectrum using regression line through five consecutive spectral values [5]. 3) Nonlinear processing (such as applying threshold

Reference-contexts: Human speech perception seems to be less sensitive to such steady-state spectral factors <ref> [2] </ref>. We have developed the RelAtive SpecTrAl (RASTA) methodology [3][4] which makes PLP (and possibly also some other short-term spectrum based techniques) more robust to linear spectral distortions.

Reference-contexts: Additional details of the experiment are given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Three experiments were carried out. In all experiments, the system was trained on the Bellcore training database. In the first experiment, the test set was a subset of the Bellcore database. Thus, we assume that both the test set and the training set were recorded under similar channel conditions.

Currently, we do nothing here. 4) Re-integrate the log critical-band temporal derivative using a first order IIR system. The pole position of this system can be adjusted to set the effective window size.

Reference-contexts: Those issues are topics of our current research. We also note that a German group of researchers, using a highpass filtering approach, primarily in the power spectral domain, has achieved encouraging results in suppressing the additive noise on a different set of speech recognition problems <ref> [8] </ref>. Their experience appears to confirm the effectiveness of the RASTA class of techniques. 6 SUMMARY A new technique for estimating a robust time-varying spectrum, RASTA-PLP, based on the filtering of time trajectories of outputs from critical-band filters, has been described.
