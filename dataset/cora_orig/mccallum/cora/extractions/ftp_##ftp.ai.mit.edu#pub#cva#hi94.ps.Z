Abstract: The Reliable Router (RR) is a network switching element targeted to two-dimensional mesh interconnection network topologies. It is designed to run at 100 MHz and reach a useful link bandwidth of 3.2 Gbit/sec. The Reliable Router uses adaptive routing coupled with link-level retransmission and a unique-token protocol to increase both performance and reliability. The RR can handle a single node or link failure anywhere in the network without interruption of service. Other unique features include a queueless low-latency plesiochronous channel interface and simultaneous bidirectional signalling.

Reference-contexts: The packet is the main unit of information exchange between the sending and receiving end. The Reliable Router can handle packets of arbitrary size. Virtual channels <ref> [4] </ref> are allocated on a packet basis. Every packet is broken into 75-bit flits. Buffering, forwarding and flow control within the system is performed at the flit level (wormhole routing). Crossbar bandwidth and physical channels are also allocated at the flit level. <p> An example of dimension-ordered routing is shown in Figure 7 (b). The order of dimensions in this example is x; y; z. Dimension-ordered routing is provably deadlock-free <ref> [4] </ref>. This virtual network exists in order to break deadlocks introduced in the previous network as suggested in [7]. The RR has two dimension-ordered virtual channels one used by packets of priority 0 and one used by packets of priority one.

Reference-contexts: It also employs a forwarding protocol at the flit level that facilitates packet reconstruction and duplicate detection at the receiving end when a fault occurs. We call this protocol the Unique Token Protocol (UTP) <ref> [5] </ref>. The coupling of these features (adaptive routing, link monitoring, link-level retransmission and the UTP) enable the RR to handle a single node or link failure anywhere in the network without interruption of service. <p> this reason the packet continues to route on fault-handling channels until it reaches the destination. 5 The Unique Token Protocol End-to-end protocols may solve the reliability problem when coupled with adaptive routing, but require extra overhead and the necessary resources do not scale linearly with the size of the machine <ref> [5] </ref>. For this reason, link-level retransmission is used in combination with a unique-token protocol (UTP) [5] to guarantee fault-tolerant exactly-once delivery of all packets in the network. <p> 5 The Unique Token Protocol End-to-end protocols may solve the reliability problem when coupled with adaptive routing, but require extra overhead and the necessary resources do not scale linearly with the size of the machine <ref> [5] </ref>. For this reason, link-level retransmission is used in combination with a unique-token protocol (UTP) [5] to guarantee fault-tolerant exactly-once delivery of all packets in the network. This link-level protocol offers significant advantages over end-to-end protocols because it does not require acknowledgment packets and does not keep copies for possible retransmissions at the packet source.

Reference-contexts: The penalty is 0.1% of link bandwidth. Plesiochronous timing is also a reliability feature because there is no single point of failure in the clock net. The RR solves the high pinout problem by using current-mode simultaneous bidirectional signalling <ref> [6] </ref>. This method has reduced the chip signal pin count from 311 signal pins to 215. This is a saving of 96 signal pins over a conventional signalling mechanism. 2 Architectural Description The Reliable Router is designed for two-dimensional mesh topologies. Its organization is shown in Figure 1. <p> Essentially this design minimizes the synchronization penalty. 7 Bidirectional Signalling The 6 input and output ports shown in Figure 1 require a large amount of interchip bandwidth. To allow the use of a conventional chip carrier with fewer than 300 pins, simultaneous bidirectional signalling <ref> [6] </ref> is employed. This method allows bidirectional point to point digital signal communication on the same chip carrier pin and at the same time. circuit board connection is modelled as a transmission line, with both ends of the line terminated with an internal resistor.

The fault-handling properties of the routing algorithm are decoupled from the adaptive properties by using a different set of virtual channels and a different adaptive algorithm the Turn Model <ref> [8] </ref> for fault-handling. One can think of a network of RRs as the superposition of three separate virtual networks: A minimally adaptive network. A packet using this network is able to route to any productive channel a channel which will bring it closer to its destination. <p> A fault-handling network. This network permits non-minimal adaptive steps and it is used to exploit the fault-handling properties of adaptive routing. The number of turns a packet can make is restricted to make the network deadlock-free <ref> [8] </ref>. The RR allocates one channel for fault-handling purposes. All three virtual networks share the same physi cal network by using different sets of virtual channels. The routing algorithm consists of three separate computations occuring in parallel. The whole route computation takes a single clock cycle.
