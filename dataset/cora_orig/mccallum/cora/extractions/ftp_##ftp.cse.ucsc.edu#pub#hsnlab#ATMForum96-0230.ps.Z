Abstract: We review the new proposed End-System Method 1 for Use-it-or-lose-it behavior proposed in Annex F of the Traffic Management Specification Version 4.0, R10, for bi-directional TCP traffic. We have studied this in an environment of explicit rate switches. This contribution is a follow-up to the work discussed in ATM Forum/95 1598.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Figure 7 shows the queue size of the Switch-1 output port to link D4. Our intention in this contribution is to evaluate the alternative UILI policy described in Annex F of version 10 of the Traffic Management Specification <ref> [1] </ref>. "When an in-rate forward RM is sent, if the ACR exceeds the recent transmission rate plus a fixed bound, the ACR is reduced by a multiplicative factor and the next increase inhibited.

Reference-contexts: Until the current Rule 5 (Time-Out based UILI) of the source behavior is triggered, the ACR reduction is a "constant factor" of (1/16) of the current ACR. In that sense, it does not impact two-way TCP behavior as significantly as before <ref> [3] </ref>, for the specific scenario examined. Since the UILI behavior has been observed to have a significant impact on performance and is influenced by application characteristics, we believe the proposed policy must be examined for other scenarios as well.
