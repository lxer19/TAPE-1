Abstract: This paper describes a model-free method for estimating the size, shape and location of large-area defects, or clusters of defective chips, evident in binary probe test data. Unlike previous methods discussed in the literature, our approach makes extensive use of the location of failing chips within the wafer map to directly estimate clusters. An important byproduct of this analysis is a decomposition of wafer yield that attributes defective chips to either large- or small-area defects. Simulation studies show that our procedure is superior to the time-honored windowing technique for achieving a similar breakdown. In addition, by directly estimating defect clusters, we can provide engineers with a greater understanding of the manufacturing process. It has been our experience that routine identification of the spatial signatures of clustered defects and associated root-cause analysis is a cost-effective approach to yield and process improvement.
