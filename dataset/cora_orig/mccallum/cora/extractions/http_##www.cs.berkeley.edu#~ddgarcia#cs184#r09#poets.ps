Abstract: Larry Gritz Technical Report GWU-IIST-94-05 Abstract The RenderMan Interface Standard was created by Pixar to provide a standard for detailed scene specification for communication between 3D modeling programs and rendering programs. It is superficially similar to PostScript, but designed as a scene description format rather than a page description language. The Computer Graphics Research Group at GWU uses the RenderMan standard for much of its work, utilizing a number of software tools written by graduate students which adhere to the RenderMan standard. This document explains how to use the RenderMan Interface and to write simple RIB files. It is intended for the reader who is familiar with the concepts of computer graphics but has little experience using RenderMan. It is designed to give the reader just enough knowledge to create simple RIB files, but not to explain the advanced features of RenderMan.
