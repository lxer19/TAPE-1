Abstract: Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up to date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user's queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users' intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database). In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k 2) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n 1=3 ). fl A preliminary version of this paper appeared in Proc. of 36th IEEE Conference on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 41-50, October 1995. y Computer Science Dept., Technion, Haifa, Israel.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research was devoted to methods that protect the database against a "curious" user. For example, there are methods that enable a user to ask queries to a statistical database in a way that prevents him from reconstructing the value of particular entities (e.g., <ref> [2, 9, 13, 14, 26] </ref> and [27, Section 10.5]). It may seem surprising at first glance that there are no methods to protect the privacy of the user.

Reference-contexts: They are similar to (but more efficient than) schemes presented in [5, 6] for the related (but different) context of instance hiding (see discussion below). Furthermore, these schemes have been subsumed by subsequent work of Am-bainis <ref> [3] </ref>. Following a recommendation by an anonymous referee, the description of these schemes was omitted from the current version. Also omitted with the abovementioned schemes are their modifications to a setting in which privacy is maintained with respect to coalitions of t &gt; 1 servers. <p> We do allow the user to perform n " time computation (where " &gt; 0 is a constant), and in particular send and receive messages longer than polylog (n). 1.3 Subsequent Work Following the conference presentation of this work, Ambainis <ref> [3] </ref> constructed more efficient Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes for k &gt; 2 servers. His k-server scheme achieves communication complexity O (n 1=(2k1) ). The construction is recursive: A k + 1-server scheme is built from a given k-server scheme (with certain properties).

Reference-contexts: He sends j to the first server, ` to the second and the three of them execute the [22] protocol. This yields a two-server PIR with communication complexity o (n). Independently of our work, Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam <ref> [4] </ref> studied the following problem, related to the one studied in [22] (where, again, the motivation comes from complexity theory). There are k + 1 players S 1 ; : : : ; S k and U . <p> He then sends to the j-th server all the indices but i j , and the servers execute the protocol. Babai et al. <ref> [4] </ref> obtain the following results: for 2 k &lt; log 2 n players the total communication is O (kn H 2 (1=(k+1)) ) (where H 2 () is the Binary Entropy function), and for k log 2 n the total communication is 2 log 2 n. <p> For k = c log 2 n the communication is polylogarithmic (note however, that the transformation into a private information retrieval scheme will cost additional c 2 log 3 2 n bits in this case). To conclude, using the results of <ref> [4] </ref> one can get much better private information retrieval schemes than those that can be obtained using [22], but still not as good as the schemes constructed in our paper. In [25, 1, 24, 5, 6] the instance hiding problem is introduced and studied.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, this is too much communication overhead, which makes it practically unacceptable. The rapid development of distributed databases (see <ref> [8] </ref>) and fast communication networks results in many scenarios in which the same database is replicated at several sites. This raises hope to get around the difficulty of achieving privacy in the single server scenario.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research was devoted to methods that protect the database against a "curious" user. For example, there are methods that enable a user to ask queries to a statistical database in a way that prevents him from reconstructing the value of particular entities (e.g., <ref> [2, 9, 13, 14, 26] </ref> and [27, Section 10.5]).

Reference-contexts: In particular, the protocols are multi-round and the data is stored in coded form (in particular, different servers do not hold replications of the same data). We stress that [21] is the only work to date which utilizes multi-round protocols. Chor and Gilboa <ref> [10] </ref> have relaxed the privacy requirement by considering computationally-bounded servers. This weaker but natural notion of privacy opens the door to improvements in communication complexity over what is known for information theoretic privacy. <p> It means that even a (possibly malicious) computationally-unbounded server cannot get any indication on the identity of the desired item. Relaxations such as requiring statistical proximity or even just computational indistinguishability may suffice in certain contexts (cf., <ref> [10] </ref>). Memoryless protocol: Both the user and server strategies are history independent. Thus, correctness and privacy are maintained even when different users (some of them possibly malicious) execute the protocols sequentially and/or concurrently.

Reference-contexts: Such schemes are presented in Section 4. Search by Keywords: Throughout this work, we assume that the user knows the physical location of the information that it is interested in. A more realistic model allows the user to retrieve information based on keywords.

Reference-contexts: (n)-private information retrieval scheme for c t (n) servers, with communication complexity O (t (n) c p n), was given. 1.2 Related Work For the case k = 2 (i.e., two servers), the question whether replication of databases can help was explicitly asked, but not answered, by Fortnow and Szegedy <ref> [15] </ref>. A first indication that something better than the user asking for a copy of x can be done is given by a result of Pudlak and Rodl [22]. With a complexity-theory motivation in mind they studied the following question.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, since every radius 1 ball contains exactly d + 1 points in f0; 1g d , the number of codewords k satisfies k 2 d d+1 (this is the volume bound, cf., <ref> [16] </ref>). This lower bound is not always attainable. The construction given above, for d = 3, uses the fact that f (0; 0; 0); (1; 1; 1)g is a covering code with radius 1 of f0; 1g 3 .

Reference-contexts: Indeed, assuming the intractability of the Quadratic Residuosity problem, they presented a single-server computational PIR scheme whose communication complexity is O (n " ), for every " &gt; 0. Gertner et. al. <ref> [17] </ref> have extended the privacy requirement so that the database's privacy is protected too. Specifically, they consider information retrieval protocols where the only information about the database contents revealed in one invocation is a single physical bit. <p> Deterministic server strategies: Randomized server strategies do not offer any advantage over deterministic ones in our context (where the concerns are correctness and privacy of the user). However, randomized server strategies are essential for database privacy as considered in <ref> [17] </ref>. Non-collusion: We assume that the servers do not collude in trying to violate the user's privacy. This does not necessarily mean that they are forbidden from communicating. Such communication may be necessary for other reasons such as updating the contents of the database.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, Ostrovsky and Shoup achieve this with an addition of one server and a poly-logarithmic communication overhead (compared to the retrieval only schemes). They use and adapt techniques of Oblivious RAM <ref> [18] </ref>, and inherit some properties of this construction. In particular, the protocols are multi-round and the data is stored in coded form (in particular, different servers do not hold replications of the same data).

Coalitions: Information-theoretic PIR schemes which tolerate collusions of up to a certain number of servers provide an alternative answer to the above concerns.

Reference-contexts: The construction is recursive: A k + 1-server scheme is built from a given k-server scheme (with certain properties). The basis of the recursion (i.e., k = 2) is our two-servers scheme. Ostrovsky and Shoup have extended the PIR scope, and invented schemes for private information storage <ref> [21] </ref>. These are schemes which, in the same distributed scenario as PIR, enable users both to read and to write into the database in a private manner (where privacy in this case is only with respect to the servers and not against other users). <p> They use and adapt techniques of Oblivious RAM [18], and inherit some properties of this construction. In particular, the protocols are multi-round and the data is stored in coded form (in particular, different servers do not hold replications of the same data).

Chor and Gilboa [10] have relaxed the privacy requirement by considering computationally-bounded servers. This weaker but natural notion of privacy opens the door to improvements in communication complexity over what is known for information theoretic privacy.

Reference-contexts: To conclude, using the results of [4] one can get much better private information retrieval schemes than those that can be obtained using [22], but still not as good as the schemes constructed in our paper. In <ref> [25, 1, 24, 5, 6] </ref> the instance hiding problem is introduced and studied. In this problem, a computationally bounded player U that holds an input (instance) i wishes to compute a known function f on input i.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research was devoted to methods that protect the database against a "curious" user. For example, there are methods that enable a user to ask queries to a statistical database in a way that prevents him from reconstructing the value of particular entities (e.g., <ref> [2, 9, 13, 14, 26] </ref> and [27, Section 10.5]). It may seem surprising at first glance that there are no methods to protect the privacy of the user.

Our schemes are based on exclusive-or (linear summations, or sum) queries; this type of queries is very common and is actually implemented in several "real-world" databases (see <ref> [9, 14, 27] </ref>). 1.1 Omitted from this Version Our original work [12] contained a full description of * Schemes for a constant number, k, of servers with communication complexity O (n 1=k ). * A scheme for 1 3 log 2 n + 1 servers with total communication complexity 1 3
