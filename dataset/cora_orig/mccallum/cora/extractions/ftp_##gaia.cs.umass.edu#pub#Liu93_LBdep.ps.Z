Abstract: In this paper we study the departure processes of two rate-control throttles: the token bank and the leaky bucket. Using sample path methods and the notion of majorization, we analyze the effect that parameters such as the token buffer capacity and token generation period have on the vector of interdeparture times. In the transient case, we establish the monotonicity of the burst reduction in the sense of the majorization. In the case that the departure process is asymptotically mean stationary and ergodic, the transient comparison results allow us to establish the monotonicity of the stationary interdeparture times in the sense of the convex ordering. Comparisons between the two flow control schemes are also established when appropriate.

Reference-contexts: We warn the reader that most other papers use the term "leaky bucket" when referring to the mechanism that we ( and Budka and Yao) refer to as the token bank. There are other ways to compare burst reduction properties of different mechanisms. For example Anantharam and Konstantopoulos <ref> [1] </ref> considered a token bank feeding a downstream infinite capacity queue with deterministic single server. They studied the effect that varying the token buffer capacity has on the buffer occupancy of the downstream queue. <p> IR !

Reference-contexts: This is because they are open loop control schemes, are easy to implement, and have been shown through numerous performance studies to effectively reduce the burstiness in the traffic offered by a source to a network (see <ref> [12, 11, 3] </ref> for examples of such studies). The goal of this paper is to investigate the burst reduction properties of two rate-control throttles, the token bank and leaky bucket.

Reference-contexts: The results of both studies corroborate the results presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: They studied the effect that varying the token buffer capacity has on the buffer occupancy of the downstream queue. They showed that the stationary buffer occupancy at this queue is a stochastically increasing function of the token buffer size in the token bank. In a companion paper <ref> [9] </ref>, we considered the effect of varying parameters on the waiting times of individual packets at such a downstream queue when it is infinite in capacity, and on the process describing the number of losses when it is finite. <p> Proof. Note that n 2 K if and only if ^a n s n . Thus, for all n 2 K, ^a n s n s 0 n , so that n 2 K 0 . The following lemma was shown in <ref> [9] </ref>: Lemma 2.7 ([9]) Let C be a rate-control throttle with token generation period length T , token buffer size B T 1 and the arrival sequence of accepted cells b A. <p> In this case, all cells are accepted, a n = ^a n . 3.1 Comparison in Transient Regime We first present the following inequalities which come from <ref> [9] </ref>. Lemma 3.1 ([9]) Assume B T 1. <p> This is trivially the case when T &gt; 1. If the sequence of cell interarrival times is a stationary and ergodic, and T &lt; 1, then the sequence of the interdeparture times converges in coupling. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref> for detailed discussions. Theorem 3.4 Assume B T 1. <p> Our results rely heavily on the following invariance properties of the rate-control throttles that we have been studying. These were established in [4] for the token bank and in <ref> [9] </ref> for the leaky bucket. Theorem 4.1 Consider two rate-control throttles with data buffer sizes B D 0 and B 0 D 0, respectively, and token buffer sizes B T 0 and B 0 T 0, respectively.
