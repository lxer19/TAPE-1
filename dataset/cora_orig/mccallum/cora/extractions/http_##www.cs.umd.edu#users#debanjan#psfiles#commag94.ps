Title: A Design for Implementation of the Internet Protocol on ATM Networks  
Author: Debanjan Saha Dipak Ghosal H. Jonathan Chao ; Satish K. Tripathi 
Abstract: This paper deals with a design and implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) on a ATM network. We discuss two different implementations of the address resolution protocol in local ATM (LATM) network. In the first scheme, a central server is maintained on a well known virtual channel (VC) accessible to all the hosts. This server is responsible for maintaining the address translation tables and managing the VCs. The second approach is a decentralized implementation in which a server is maintained for a set of hosts. We also address the IP routing issues in ATM based wide area networks.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the key developments in computer communication systems during the last decade has been the explosive growth in computer networks. The majority of the countries in the world <ref> [1] </ref> are now connected via networks offering a wide variety of services from simple electronic-mail to other more complex services such as file transfers and remote login to supercomputer sites. These computer networks comprise of local area networks (LANs) interconnected by gateways and routers to form wide area networks.

Reference-contexts: The ATM is viewed as an emerging technology capable of removing this bottleneck [11, 10]. Most packet data networks employ a connectionless datagram service at the network layer. The Internet Protocol (IP) is one such example <ref> [4] </ref>. The popularity and the continued growth in data networks is likely to keep the existing protocols well embedded in the communications networks despite new emerging technologies. In this paper we consider the design and implementation issues of supporting IP on a ATM network. <p> The host rebuilds its cache like a new one. 4. HT as a cache: Similar to the address resolution table <ref> [4] </ref>, the HT can be operated as a cache in which the entries are invalidated after a certain time period. 5. LATM network with multiple ATM switches: The extension is straightforward and only one CM for the entire network will suffice.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider the design and implementation issues of supporting IP on a ATM network. Although the design details are illustrated in the context of IP, this proposal is applicable to other connection-less network layer protocols such as SMDS <ref> [9] </ref> and MTP in the SS7 protocol [6]. There have been several working drafts [14, 15, 12] on compatible and interoperable implementations for transmitting IP datagrams over ATM networks. There are two problems to address. First is the address resolution in local ATM networks. The second is routing.

Reference-contexts: The existing local area networks are based on shared media interconnects (e.g., Ethernet, FDDI) and are likely to become the potential bottlenecks for isochronous traffic inherent in all multimedia applications. The ATM is viewed as an emerging technology capable of removing this bottleneck <ref> [11, 10] </ref>. Most packet data networks employ a connectionless datagram service at the network layer. The Internet Protocol (IP) is one such example [4]. The popularity and the continued growth in data networks is likely to keep the existing protocols well embedded in the communications networks despite new emerging technologies.

Reference-contexts: This scheme however needs a mechanism to resolve IP addresses to ATM addresses in wide area networks. One approach <ref> [13] </ref> suggested is to enhance the Domain Name System (DNS) to provide the ATM address along with the IP address. The DNS-based address resolution procedure relies on the idea of using the existing Domain Name System to resolve the IP addresses.
