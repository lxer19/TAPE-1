Abstract: This paper presents an approach to integrated acquistion, evaluation, tuning, and execution of elementary skills in order to ease programming and employment of robots. To allow the use of machine learning techniques as well as real-time execution of the skills, a twofold representation is developed. The individual learning tasks involved in the generation and maintenance of skills are identified and related to proper learning techniques. A programming environment and a low level architecture taking care of the different requirements during all phases of skill acquisition and execution are described.

Reference-contexts: In the robotics community, the concept of skills can be found throughout a number of different applications. Skills are usually employed in a NASREM-style hierarchical architecture <ref> (Albus et al., 1981) </ref>, where they integrate the H, M , and G modules up to the level of action primitives. In telerobotics, robots provide the capability to autonomously execute certain operations and relieve the operator from difficult control tasks.

Reference-contexts: These individual capabilities are referred to as skills, the concept itself is also known as shared autonomy (Brunner et al., 1992), (Hasegawa et al., 1992). In robot programming, SKills-Oriented Robot Programming (SKORP, see <ref> (Archibald and Petriu, 1993) </ref>) relies on the existence of a set of skills as the building blocks of a robot program (Dufay and Latombe, 1984), (Heise, 1989), (Kaiser and Kreuziger, 1994). The approaches to skill learning are mainly aiming at identifying a control function for a given task.

Reference-contexts: A natural application of the PbD paradigm in the area of robotics concerns the acquisition of elementary skills <ref> (Asada and Yang, 1989) </ref>, (Delson and West, 1993), (Kaiser, 1994). These elementary skills must be provided by the robot for the execution of elementary operations. <p> The approaches to skill learning are mainly aiming at identifying a control function for a given task. They can be found both in the robotics <ref> (Asada and Yang, 1989) </ref>, (Delson and West, 1993), (Liu and Asada, 1993) and the machine learning community (Gullapalli, 1992), (Lin, 1993).

Reference-contexts: While errors can relatively easily be detected by the user himself on the task level, it is almost impossible to classify single control inputs as good or bad. Usually, only the complete execution can be evaluated safely, resulting in a scenario which is typical for reinforcement learning <ref> (Barto et al., 1983) </ref>. In this paper, the individual learning tasks involved in the generation of controllers for elementary operations will be identified. They will be related to appropriate learning techniques, which pose certain requirements on the representation and handling of both given examples and learned descriptions.

Reference-contexts: A natural application of the PbD paradigm in the area of robotics concerns the acquisition of elementary skills (Asada and Yang, 1989), <ref> (Delson and West, 1993) </ref>, (Kaiser, 1994). These elementary skills must be provided by the robot for the execution of elementary operations.

Reference-contexts: In robot programming, SKills-Oriented Robot Programming (SKORP, see (Archibald and Petriu, 1993)) relies on the existence of a set of skills as the building blocks of a robot program <ref> (Dufay and Latombe, 1984) </ref>, (Heise, 1989), (Kaiser and Kreuziger, 1994). The approaches to skill learning are mainly aiming at identifying a control function for a given task. <p> As figure 3 shows, the segmentation of a given example results in a sequence of phases. This sequence can be employed as an example to be used to induce the structure of the task (see also <ref> (Dufay and Latombe, 1984) </ref>). Following the segmentation of the set of available examples, the control functions taking care of the individual segments, i.e., the skills controlling the several phases of the task are to be learned. This task comprises two different aspects.

Reference-contexts: For the actual generation of a controller (i.e., for a set of skills taking care of the individual "phases" of a task), several techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy controllers are available <ref> (Giordana et al., 1994) </ref>. However, each of these techniques must be used in accordance with the characteristics of the given problem. The actual parameterization of the employed technique must be supported by an analysis of the given training data yielding a set of constraints that the parameters must fulfill.
