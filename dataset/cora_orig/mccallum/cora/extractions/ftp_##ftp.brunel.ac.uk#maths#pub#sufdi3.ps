Title: Sufficient conditions for a digraph to be Hamiltonian  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Gregory Gutin Hao Li 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the memory of Henri Meyniel Abstract We describe a new type of sufficient condition for a digraph to be Hamiltonian. Conditions of this type combine local structure of the digraph with conditions on the degrees of non-adjacent vertices. The main difference from earlier conditions is that we do not require a degree condition on all pairs of non-adjacent vertices. Our results generalize the classical conditions by Ghouila-Houri and Woodall.

Reference-contexts: However no such condition would be sufficient, even together with some requirement on the connectivity. This follows from the existence of arbitrarily highly strongly connected non-Hamiltonian digraphs D in which no pair of non-adjacent vertices x and y is joined by a (directed) path of length two (see <ref> [7] </ref>). We believe that Theorem 4.2 can be generalized to the following, which would also generalize Meyniel's Theorem. Conjecture 6.1 Let D be a strong digraph. Suppose that d (x)+d (y) 2n1 for every pair of dominating non-adjacent and every pair of dominated nonadjacent vertices fx; yg.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we give examples to show that this is so and to demonstrate the sharpness of our results. We conclude with some remarks and conjectures. 2 Terminology and notation We shall assume that the reader is familiar with the standard terminology on digraphs and refer to <ref> [9] </ref> for terminology not discussed here. Every cycle and path is assumed simple and directed; its length is the number of its arcs. D always denotes a digraph with n vertices; it is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle, namely a cycle of length n.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1.3 [15, (Meyniel)] If d (x) + d (y) 2n 1 for all pairs of non adjacent vertices in D then D is Hamiltonian. It is easy to see that Theorem 1.3 implies Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. For a short proof of Theorem 1.3 see <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Thus, if r = m we are done. Otherwise apply induction to the paths P [u i r ; u s ] and Q fl . 2 The following lemma is a slight modification of the lemma in <ref> [10] </ref>; its proof is almost the same. Lemma 3.2 Let Q = v 1 v 2 : : : v t be a path in D and let w; w 0 be vertices of V (D) V (Q) (possibly w = w 0 ). <p> If, in addition, v t does not dominate w, then d Q (w) t. 4 Main Results Note that the proof of Theorem 4.1 initially follows the line of reasoning in the proof of Meyniel's theorem in <ref> [10] </ref> (see also [8]).

Then D is Hamiltonian. <p> Then D is Hamiltonian. Proof: Assume that D is non-Hamiltonian and C = x 1 x 2 :::x m x 1 is a longest cycle in D. As in the proof of Theorem 2 in <ref> [10] </ref>, we can show that D contains a C-bypass P = u 1 u 2 :::u s (s 3). Without loss of generality, let u 1 = x 1 ; u s = x fl+1 , 0 &lt; fl &lt; m.
