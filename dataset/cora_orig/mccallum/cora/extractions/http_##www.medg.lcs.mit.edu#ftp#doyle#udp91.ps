Abstract: Research on nonmonotonic and default reasoning has identified several important criteria for preferring alternative default inferences. The theories of reasoning based on each of these criteria may uniformly be viewed as theories of rational inference, in which the reasoner selects maximally preferred states of belief. Though researchers have noted some cases of apparent conflict between the preferences supported by different theories, it has been hoped that these special theories of reasoning may be combined into a universal logic of nonmonotonic reasoning. We show that the different categories of preferences conflict more than has been realized, and adapt formal results from social choice theory to prove that every universal theory of default reasoning will violate at least one reasonable principle of rational reasoning. Our results can be interpreted as demonstrating that, within the preferential framework, we cannot expect much improvement on the rigid lexicographic priority mechanisms that have been proposed for conflict resolution.

Reference-contexts: To support this conclusion, we use Shoham's formalism [4, 56] to translate questions about nonmonotonic inference into the context of rational decision making. This translation allows us to adapt Arrow's <ref> [1, 2] </ref> celebrated results about the impossibility of universal social choice rules to the case of nonmonotonic inference. <p> The aggregation policy itself is called a social choice function. The main result of social choice theory is a startling theorem due to Arrow <ref> [1] </ref> that establishes the impossibility of social choice functions possessing several specific desirable and apparently reasonable properties. In Sections 4.3 and 4.4, we show that slightly modified versions of this result apply to preferential nonmonotonic logics, with important implications for the potential construction of universal default formalisms.

Nondictatorship (noncomprehensive criteria). <p> Proof: With the restriction to total preorders, this is exactly Arrow's theorem applied to choices among models. For a proof of the original result see Arrow <ref> [2] </ref>, Roberts [50, Chapter 7], or any book on social choice theory.2 There is no problem finding good aggregation policies for choices among only two alternatives. <p> Partiality is constrained, however, by the conflict resolution condition's restriction that the global order be 15 Doyle & Wellman at least as complete as the constituent orders. An examination of Arrow's proof of Theorem 1 <ref> [2] </ref> reveals that it does not depend on totality of the individual orders, and presumes totality of the global orders only for cases where an individual expresses a preference.

Reference-contexts: To support this conclusion, we use Shoham's formalism <ref> [4, 56] </ref> to translate questions about nonmonotonic inference into the context of rational decision making. This translation allows us to adapt Arrow's [1, 2] celebrated results about the impossibility of universal social choice rules to the case of nonmonotonic inference. <p> Despite their diversity, Shoham [56] has shown how to cast a number of these theories in similar form, as sound inference with respect to models maximal in some partial order. In the more general form of his construction <ref> [4] </ref>, a nonmonotonic logic is characterized by a partial preorder (that is, a 2 Impediments to Universal Default Theories reflexive and transitive relation) v over a set M of interpretations, which, depending on the base logical language L, represent truth assignments, models, Kripke structures, or similar objects. <p> In this case, there is a secondary dictator deciding conflicts among the candidates for which this criterion expresses no preference. This cascade of dictators continues until all conflicts are resolved. As an example, we exhibit the preference aggregation function corresponding to the stratified logic scheme of Brown and Shoham <ref> [4] </ref>. Modifying their notation slightly, the problem is to determine the global order v from an ordered set of individual orders v i , 0 i n.

Reference-contexts: Toward this end, some theories have been proposed as unifications or partial unifications of some of these ways of making assumptions <ref> [13, 25, 31, 32, 56] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These theories are also somewhat incompatible.

It is not feasible to resolve these conflicts in advance. Therefore, any universal theory must rely on some method that takes the available set of preference criteria and combines them into a global criterion. 5.

Reference-contexts: Thus, despite their lexicographic flavor, stratified logics do not satisfy our aggregation principles. In McCarthy's prioritized circumscription [36], minimizing the abnormality of each predicate is a distinct preference criterion, and the global minimization is based on a lexicographic decision procedure using a predefined order on the predicates. Grosof <ref> [17] </ref> generalizes this to arbitrary partial preorders on arbitrary model-preference criteria, but the prioritization resolves conflicts only to the extent that the orders are stratified in the lexicographic sense illustrated above. An example of lexicographic choice in everyday societal decision making is the judicial hierarchy of courts.

Reference-contexts: Substitution of these variants for the usual satisfaction and entailment concepts yields a complete description of the nonmonotonic logic L v . Shoham illustrates the construction by providing orders corresponding to circumscription [29], the minimal knowledge logic of Halpern and Moses <ref> [18] </ref>, his own chronological ignorance [56], and a few others. In circumscription, for example, models are ranked by minimality according to subset relations among extensions of specific predicates designated as abnormalities.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, doubts about the existence of complete unifications have also been expressed because the different theories of nonmonotonic inference may indicate conflicting conclusions when the underlying default rules conflict. Early indications of difficulty appeared with Hanks and McDermott's <ref> [19] </ref> so-called "Yale shooting problem". Subsequently, Touretzky et al. [61] argued that the gross differences between competing theories of inheritance stem from disparate underlying intuitions about how to make assumptions. <p> Unfortunately, the potential for conflict among these criteria impedes integration attempts. 3.1 Examples of conflicts The famous "Yale shooting problem" of Hanks and McDermott <ref> [19] </ref> illustrates that basic nonmonotonic logics are too weak to arbitrate conflicts among abnormality minimization of different properties. Initially, in their example, a gun is loaded and Fred is alive. After an interval of waiting, the gun is fired at Fred.

Reference-contexts: In these theories, problematic conflicts between specific defaults are resolved in every possible way, with each different set of conclusions representing a maximal consistent set of preferences. In contrast, Shoham's logics, circumscription, closed-world reasoning [48], Pollock's defeasible inference [46], and so-called "skeptical" inheritance <ref> [21, 57] </ref> resemble ordinary logic in that they describe how a set of axioms or rules yields a single set of conclusions closed under inference. These theories handle conflicts either by failing to draw any conclusions involving dissonant problematic preferences or by drawing every conclusion from them (explicit inconsistency).

Reference-contexts: In their terminology, the credibility of a sample of events conflicts with its specificity. As Longley-Cook puts it, when they try to slice the cake too many ways at once they are "left with a useless collection of crumbs" <ref> [33] </ref>. Similarly, conflicts may occur within reasoners that have multiple informants or refer to multiple authorities to obtain their information. For instance, Milton Friedman presents arguments for free trade, while Lester Thurow presents arguments for controlled trade. These arguments seem individually coherent, but are mutually contradictory.

Reference-contexts: In fact, overruling an explicit preference with unrelatedness sometimes violates the Pareto principle and always violates the conflict resolution principle. Thus, despite their lexicographic flavor, stratified logics do not satisfy our aggregation principles. In McCarthy's prioritized circumscription <ref> [36] </ref>, minimizing the abnormality of each predicate is a distinct preference criterion, and the global minimization is based on a lexicographic decision procedure using a predefined order on the predicates.

Reference-contexts: In these theories, problematic conflicts between specific defaults are resolved in every possible way, with each different set of conclusions representing a maximal consistent set of preferences. In contrast, Shoham's logics, circumscription, closed-world reasoning [48], Pollock's defeasible inference <ref> [46] </ref>, and so-called "skeptical" inheritance [21, 57] resemble ordinary logic in that they describe how a set of axioms or rules yields a single set of conclusions closed under inference. <p> These theories handle conflicts either by failing to draw any conclusions involving dissonant problematic preferences or by drawing every conclusion from them (explicit inconsistency). Both approaches have their defenders. Pollock <ref> [46] </ref>, for example, advocates skepticism in the face of problematic conflicts on the grounds that belief should be based on epistem-ically defensible positions. But neither skepticism nor credulity is always rational.

Unification in the face of these conflicts is possible only if we can divide responsibility among the different methods so that each theory of particular cases provides the right criterion of correctness for inferential problems appearing in its domain.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The proliferation of formalisms for nonmonotonic inference [16] attests to a diverse set of methods for reasoning by default. These include circumscriptive inference [29, 31, 35], which draws those conclusions valid in all minimal models of a set of axioms; autoepistemic inference [39, 42] and default logic <ref> [49] </ref>, which permit rules of inference to refer to unprovable statements as well as provable ones; specificity-based taxonomic inference [60], which makes assumptions based on the most specific of the relevant prototypes; and chronologically ignorant inference [56], which draws conclusions based on the shortest or simplest possible histories of events. <p> To investigate whether this is the case, let us consider aggregating a set of default rules in the sense of Reiter <ref> [49] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: rule is not a legal aggregation policy because the resulting global order v is not guaranteed to be transitive when there are more than two models to be ranked. (The intransitivity of majority rule is also known as "Condorcet's voting paradox", after the eighteenth century social scientist who discovered it <ref> [50] </ref>.) 5 Use of an ordered index set (e.g., I = f0; : : : ; ng) does not generally reflect any prioritization of these criteria. <p> In other words, the global order agrees with uncontested strict preferences. 3. Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). The relation of M 1 and M 2 according to the global order depends only on how the individual orders rank those two candidates. 6 Consult sources on social choice theory <ref> [2, 50] </ref> for somewhat more rigorous versions of these desiderata, though for the case of total preorders. 9 Doyle & Wellman That is, the global order restricted to a subset of candidates is equivalent to an aggregation of the individual orders restricted to that subset. 4. Nondictatorship (noncomprehensive criteria). <p> Proof: With the restriction to total preorders, this is exactly Arrow's theorem applied to choices among models. For a proof of the original result see Arrow [2], Roberts <ref> [50, Chapter 7] </ref>, or any book on social choice theory.2 There is no problem finding good aggregation policies for choices among only two alternatives.

Reference-contexts: For example, the degree of chronological minimization might be measured by the temporal distance between events. Taken alone, intercriteria comparison only opens the door a crack, leading to aggregation policies that are almost-but-not-quite dictatorial (in a precise sense described, for example, by Roberts <ref> [51] </ref>). And incorporating only intracriterial intensity comparisons does not help at all.

Reference-contexts: The effect of intransitivity would be to make more models maximal as compared with those maximal under the transitive closure of the relation, and thus make the nonmonotonic consequences of a theory less complete. Rychlik <ref> [52] </ref> proposes such an intransitive scheme, and motivates it with an example where chronological ignorance loses force over long durations.

Reference-contexts: This particular modification seems appropriate for nonmonotonic logic because the concepts of preferential satisfaction and entailment distinguish only between maximal and nonmaximal elements of the preference order. However, this apparent weakening of the aggregation framework does not offer much improvement in the prospects for obtaining satisfactory aggregation functions. Sen <ref> [54] </ref> points out that proofs of the various impossibility results typically apply directly to the case of choice of maximal elements.

Reference-contexts: The original theories provided precise formal concepts, but motivated explanations of why these concepts were interesting appeared only later, when Doyle [6, 9], Shoham <ref> [55] </ref>, and others [26, 28] justified default rules by an appeal to decision-theoretic rationality, saying that an agent should adopt a default conclusion or default rule if the expected inferential utility of holding it exceeds that of not holding it.

Reference-contexts: minimal models of a set of axioms; autoepistemic inference [39, 42] and default logic [49], which permit rules of inference to refer to unprovable statements as well as provable ones; specificity-based taxonomic inference [60], which makes assumptions based on the most specific of the relevant prototypes; and chronologically ignorant inference <ref> [56] </ref>, which draws conclusions based on the shortest or simplest possible histories of events. In addition to these generic patterns, there are often domain-dependent reasons for adopting default policies in particular problem situations. <p> Toward this end, some theories have been proposed as unifications or partial unifications of some of these ways of making assumptions <ref> [13, 25, 31, 32, 56] </ref>. At the same time, doubts about the existence of complete unifications have also been expressed because the different theories of nonmonotonic inference may indicate conflicting conclusions when the underlying default rules conflict. <p> To support this conclusion, we use Shoham's formalism <ref> [4, 56] </ref> to translate questions about nonmonotonic inference into the context of rational decision making. This translation allows us to adapt Arrow's [1, 2] celebrated results about the impossibility of universal social choice rules to the case of nonmonotonic inference. <p> We also draw on the literature of social choice to consider some possible ways around these results. 2 Preferential theories of default reasoning The initial theories of default, circumscriptive, autoepistemic, chronologically ignorant, and specificity-based taxonomic inference had very different appearances. Despite their diversity, Shoham <ref> [56] </ref> has shown how to cast a number of these theories in similar form, as sound inference with respect to models maximal in some partial order. <p> Substitution of these variants for the usual satisfaction and entailment concepts yields a complete description of the nonmonotonic logic L v . Shoham illustrates the construction by providing orders corresponding to circumscription [29], the minimal knowledge logic of Halpern and Moses [18], his own chronological ignorance <ref> [56] </ref>, and a few others. In circumscription, for example, models are ranked by minimality according to subset relations among extensions of specific predicates designated as abnormalities. <p> James argued that cases of rational belief are ubiquitous in mundane reasoning, an assessment corroborated by the pervasiveness of default reasoning in artificial intelligence. 3 In the earlier version of this paper [12], we criticized Shoham's definition of &lt; in <ref> [56] </ref> as opposite in sense to the usual notion of preference. That criticism was wrong, based on a misreading of Shoham's definition. <p> Which violation is more abnormal? In this view, the normality of loadedness after waiting and life after shooting are two conflicting criteria. Defenders of nonmonotonic logics have responded by proposing a third criterion|such as chronological minimization <ref> [56] </ref> or some causality theory [30]|to resolve the issue. However, as Hanks and McDermott point out, in some contexts other criteria (perhaps even chronological max imization for diagnostic reasoning) may be compelling, leading to further unresolvable conflicts. <p> Thus these preferences induce a total preorder (shown in Fig. 2): any two models are related by ~ or &lt;, and hence by v. While there may be other motivated ways of interpreting default rules as preference orders over states of belief (see, for example, <ref> [13, 20, 56] </ref>), the interpretation above seems a natural one, and is corroborated by previous results of Doyle [6, 7] which showed that the 13 Doyle & Wellman :LP _ (LP ^ :L:Q ^ LR) LP ^ :L:Q ^ :LR & % & % & % 6 ~ extensions of default

While one might view this situation as a reflection of the limits of current epistemology, perhaps a better view is that these conflicts reflect the more general problem of irreconcilable conflicts among values examined by Van Frassen <ref> [63] </ref>. 3.2 Skeptical and credulous conflict resolution Any comprehensive mechanism for nonmonotonic reasoning must embody some way of handling the conflicts that arise among the different patterns of inference. Some theories provide explicit criteria for resolving unproblematic conflicts.
