Abstract: We describe a framework for learning saccadic eye movements using a photometric representation of target points in natural scenes. The representation takes the form of a high-dimensional vector comprised of the responses of spatial filters at different orientations and scales. We first demonstrate the use of this response vector in the task of locating previously foveated points in a scene and subsequently use this property in a multisaccade strategy to derive an adaptive motor map for delivering accurate saccades.

Reference-contexts: Results from neurophysiological and psychophysical studies suggest that in humans, this knowledge is acquired via learning: infants show a gradual increase in saccadic accuracy during their first year <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and adults can adapt to changes (caused for example by weakening of eye-muscles) in the interrelation between visual input and the saccades needed for centering. <p> One possible drawback of the proposed algorithm is that for large retinal spaces, learning saccadic motor vectors for every retinal location can be time-consuming and in some cases, even infeasible <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to address this problem, we have recently proposed a variation of the current learning algorithm which uses a sparse motor map in conjunction with distributed coding of the saccadic motor vectors.

Reference-contexts: These sensors are inspired by similar structures found in the primate retina where one finds both a peripheral region of gradually decreasing acuity and a circularly symmetric area centralis characterized by a greater density of receptors and a disproportionate representation in the optic nerve <ref> [3] </ref>. The peripheral region, though of low visual acuity, is more sensitive to light intensity and movement. <p> Due to their high velocities, guidance through visual feedback is not possible and hence, saccadic movement is preprogrammed or ballistic: a pattern of muscle activation is calculated in advance that will direct the fovea almost exactly to the desired position <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, we describe an iconic representation of scene points that facilitates top-down foveal targeting.

Reference-contexts: The exact number of Gaussian derivative basis functions used is motivated by the need to make the representations invariant to rotations in the image plane (see [11] for more details). This invariance can be achieved by exploiting the property of steerability <ref> [4] </ref> which allows filter responses at arbitrary orientations to be synthesized from a finite set of basis filters.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe an iconic representation of scene points that facilitates top-down foveal targeting. The representation takes the form of a high-dimensional vector comprised of the responses of different order Gaussian derivative filters, which are known to form the principal components of natural images <ref> [5] </ref>, at variety of orientations and scales. Such a representation has been recently shown to be useful for visual tasks ranging from texture segmentation [7] to object indexing using a sparse distributed memory [11]. <p> Iconic scene descriptions can be obtained, for instance, by employing a bank of linear spatial filters at a variety of orientations and scales. In our approach, we use derivative of Gaussian filters since these are known to form the dominant eigenvectors of natural images <ref> [5] </ref> and can thus be expected to yield reliable results when used as basis functions for indexing 1 . The exact number of Gaussian derivative basis functions used is motivated by the need to make the representations invariant to rotations in the image plane (see [11] for more details).

Reference-contexts: The 45-dimensional vector representation described above shares some of the favorable matching properties that accrue to high-dimensional vectors (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>). In particular, the distribution of distances between points in the 45-dimensional space of these vectors approximates a normal distribution; most of the points in the space lie at approximately the mean distance and are thus relatively uncorrelated to a given point [11]. <p> In order to address this problem, we have recently proposed a variation of the current learning algorithm which uses a sparse motor map in conjunction with distributed coding of the saccadic motor vectors. This organization bears some striking similarities to Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model <ref> [6] </ref> and is in concurrence with recent neurophysiological evidence [8] supporting a distributed population encoding of saccadic movements in the superior colliculus.

Reference-contexts: The use of multiple scales increases the perspicuity of the representation and allows interpolation strategies for scale invariance (see <ref> [9] </ref> for more details). The entire representation can be computed using only nine convolutions done at frame-rate within a pipeline image processor with nine constant size 8 fi 8 kernels on a five-level octave-separated low-pass-filtered pyramid of the input image.

Reference-contexts: Our approach differs from previous strategies for learning motor maps (for instance, <ref> [12] </ref>) in that we use the visual modality to actively supply the necessary reinforcement signal required during the motor learning step (Section 3.2). 2 The Multiscale Spatial Filter Representation In the active vision framework, vision is seen as subserving a larger context of the encompassing behaviors that the agent is engaged <p> The formation of sensory map can be achieved using Kohonen's well-known stochastic learning algorithm by using a Gaussian input density function as described in <ref> [12] </ref>.
