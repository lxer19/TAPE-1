Abstract: While researchers strive to develop new systems to enhance the cooperative document editing process, many authors already collaborate, using existing text processing systems to produce papers and reports. Using these tools, one of the most time-consuming and error-prone collaboration tasks is maintaining a consistent shared bibliography. We have designed and implemented the BIBDB system to simplify collaborative authoring by providing a shared, cooperatively maintained bibliographic database. BIBDB uses existing networking technology and merges seamlessly into the L A T E X/BIBT E X text processing system [5]. The contributions of BIBDB include a set of user interface policies and software implementation techniques that support cooperative database maintenance.
