Abstract: The recent enormous increase in the use of networked information access and online databases has led to more databases being available in languages other than English. The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts is involved in a variety of industrial, government, and digital library applications which have a need for multilingual text retrieval. Most information retrieval research, however, has been evaluated using English databases and queries, and relatively little is known about how well advanced statistical techniques that incorporate ranking and term weighting perform in different languages. We describe our experience with a range of projects involving text retrieval in Spanish, Japanese and Chinese. The issues covered by these projects include document representation techniques such as morphology and segmentation, query formulation and expansion techniques, relevance feedback, and comparisons of retrieval effectiveness with English databases. The results indicate that advanced statistical techniques are effective in a wide range of languages, and that new languages can be incorporated with only moderate effort.

Reference-contexts: This reduced our data space requirements tenfold while still giving us good performance. Further research, suggested by the success of Cornell's simple Spanish stemmer <ref> (Buckley et al, 1995) </ref>, showed that similar retrieval performance can be achieved with a suffix-trimming stemmer that only removes plurals and gender suffixes. This stemmer was written in less than one day, but other languages such as Arabic would be considerably more difficult.

Reference-contexts: Tools for query processing and query expansion Natural language queries (in English) can be transformed into INQUERY queries using tools such as a part-of-speech tagger <ref> (Church, 1988) </ref> and a stop structure recognizer (removing phrases such as "Give me documents about ..."). Queries can also be automatically expanded using related phrases from the corpus (Jing and Croft 1994).

Reference-contexts: Introduction The recent enormous increase in the use of networked information access and online databases has led to more databases being available in languages other than English. The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts <ref> (Croft 1995) </ref> is involved in a variety of industrial, government, and digital library applications which have a need for multilingual text retrieval. <p> The ranking function used is similar to other advanced statistical systems that incorporate "tf.idf" weights (Salton and McGill, 1983). The effectiveness of this process has been demonstrated by recall/precision evaluations in TREC and other settings <ref> (e.g. Rajashekar and Croft 95) </ref>, and there are significant usability advantages for ranked output. Ability to handle both simple and complex queries The INQUERY query language provides a range of operators which are used to specify how evidence in the document text should be combined to estimate relevance. <p> Another approach to generating a stemmer for a new language is to derive corpus-based relationships between word variants using a measure of statistical dependence based on cooccurrence in text windows <ref> (Croft and Xu, 1995) </ref>. If this measure of dependence for two word variants exceeds a threshold value, those variants are put into the same synonym or equivalence class. In order to reduce the computational requirements, two methods of deriving initial equivalence classes were tested in English. <p> A query is expanded by evaluating it against a PhraseFinder database, selecting the top ranked concepts, weighting them, and adding them to the query. This approach has recently been tested on a small Japanese newspaper database <ref> (Han, Fujii and Croft, 1995) </ref>. These experiments found many of the same results as English with regard to the PhraseFinder parameters such as the size of the text window used for determining associations and the weighting algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For example, a PhraseFinder database may contain an amnesty program pseudo-document that is indexed by 1986, act, control, immigrant, law, etc. Although very different in implementation, the approach is similar in spirit to the distributed representation used by the LSI system <ref> (Deerwester et al, 1990) </ref>. The usual document retrieval algorithms are used to retrieve the pseudo-documents that represent concepts. Thus, INQUERY can use any structured query to retrieve a ranked list of concepts.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, one can often see English alphabetic words in a Japanese text, especially as proper nouns such as IBM or C. In a recent study, we examined character-based and word-based representations for documents in INQUERY <ref> (Fujii and Croft, 1993) </ref>. <p> In word-based indexing, the connections between a query compound word and the compound elements are specified using the operators. d 1 I 1 (cognitive science) (knowledge engineering) (chemical industry) (recog nize) (know) (subject)(study)(be conscious) (art) (metamor phose) (work) (human) (ability)(art) (know) (artificial intelligence) inference network. In our earlier experiments <ref> (Fujii and Croft, 1993) </ref>, we found that character-based representations produced similar retrieval effectiveness to word-based representations. Performance was, in fact, slightly higher at higher recall levels which appeared to be due to a low-level thesaurus effect from matching individual characters (suggested by Figures 2 and 3). <p> For example, a query, I want to know about the advancement of Japanese companies in southeastern Asia could be translated into #SUM (advancement #PHRASE (Japanese companies) #PHRASE (southeastern Asia)). We have tested four models for transforming queries, namely NLQ, SHORT, LONG, and JOINED <ref> (Fujii and Croft, 1993) </ref>. The NLQ (=natural language query) model does not assume any structure between words or characters. The SHORT model groups a set of Kanji characters in a word. The LONG model clusters nouns with adjectival modifications (e.g., Tounan [southeast (n.)] Ajia [Asia]).

Reference-contexts: The system has been used in a variety of research projects and applications, and it has been consistently very effective in the governmentsponsored TREC evaluations <ref> (Harman 1995) </ref>. The following list gives a brief overview of the major features of INQUERY that are used in the research described here. <p> Although this is quite an old technique, much has been learned recently about feedback with full-text documents and larger numbers of training examples in the TREC experiments <ref> (Harman, 1995) </ref>. The two basic steps in this learning process are term selection and term weighting. Term selection involves choosing the words or phrases to be added to the original query, and term weighting assigns relative importance to them.

Reference-contexts: Quality can be further enhanced by indexing the document collection on a character basis, and then segmenting the queries, either automatically or by hand. Character-based retrieval is discussed further in the next section. The CIIR has developed a stochastic word segmentation program which uses a Hidden Markov Model algorithm <ref> (Huang et al, 1990) </ref> to find a best-fit word segmentation for a sequence of characters. One advantage of this approach is that it is an order of magnitude faster (over 100 Mbytes/hr) because dictionary lookup is used only during training, but not at runtime.

Reference-contexts: Queries can also be automatically expanded using related phrases from the corpus <ref> (Jing and Croft 1994) </ref>. <p> Automatic query expansion through corpus analysis is a promising solution to this problem. Our approach to query expansion (called PhraseFinder) is based on the assumption that concepts found in similar lexical contexts may also be related semantically <ref> (Jing and Croft, 1994) </ref>. For example, the words connectionist and neural networks might occur in similar lexical contexts, but rarely in the same documents. The semantic relationship captured is not necessarily synonymy, because PhraseFinde r a lso might r elate connectionist and back propagation, which co-occur but have different meanings.

Reference-contexts: Flexible and efficient indexing - The INQUERY indexing process is designed to be easily extensible in order to incorporate a variety of document structures (e.g. HTML, MARC, etc.), different morphological processing techniques such as stemming <ref> (Krovetz 1993) </ref>, and domainspecific concept recognizers (e.g. marking occurrences of people, companies, locations, and dates). <p> Spanish Morphology Stemming is a general term used to describe the process of conflating word variants, usually by removing letters. The typical case in Western European languages is to remove suffixes to reduce 4 all forms of a word to one sequence of letters called a stem <ref> (Krovetz 1993) </ref>. The purpose of stemming is to enhance recall. In English, inflectional endings such as plurals and verb suffixes must be removed. Beyond that the problem gets more complex.

Reference-contexts: The word-based indexing technique extracts words (or some normalized forms like word stems), as the index terms. Segmentation was performed using the JUMAN program <ref> (Matsumoto et al, 1991) </ref>. Examples of character-based and word-based indexing are shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b). methods can be used in the INQUERY framework. In decomposed into a set of Kanji characters. In Figure 3, each Kanji compound noun is divided into its components.

Reference-contexts: The Library of Congress, for example, is working with the CIIR on providing access to the laws and regulations of many countries, both in English and in the native language. Despite the interest in multilingual retrieval, most information retrieval research has been done using English <ref> (Salton and McGill 1983, Harman 1994) </ref>. Groups in France, Germany and Israel have reported results on some aspects of text retrieval in their native languages, but little has been published on Asian languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Korean, or other important languages such as Arabic. <p> The probability value is then used to rank the documents for presentation to the user. The ranking function used is similar to other advanced statistical systems that incorporate "tf.idf" weights <ref> (Salton and McGill, 1983) </ref>. The effectiveness of this process has been demonstrated by recall/precision evaluations in TREC and other settings (e.g. Rajashekar and Croft 95), and there are significant usability advantages for ranked output. <p> Support for relevance feedback and routing - User feedback on the relevance of retrieved documents can automatically modify either a query in a typical interactive session or a profile in a routing environment where incoming documents are compared to stored profiles <ref> (Salton and McGill 1983, Buckley, Salton and Allan, 1994) </ref>. The two main steps in the query modification process are term selection and term weighting. Term selection (in English) involves choosing which words and phrases from the relevant documents should be added to the query. <p> As an example of the type of expansion phrases obtained using this technique, the query Japanese automobile retrieved the phrases lead plate steel, Japanese automobile industry, production company, GE, automobile market, automobile distribution, automobile telephone, MDC Company, automobile part maker and European market. Relevance Feedback in Chinese Relevance feedback <ref> (Salton and McGill, 1983) </ref> is a technique where user judgments on the relevance and non-relevance of retrieved documents are used to modify the original query and improve the retrieval effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: Statistical retrieval, which emphasizes simple, natural language queries and ranked output, has been shown in many experimental studies to produce significantly better retrieval results <ref> (Turtle, 1994) </ref> and has recently become the predominant approach in commercial systems. More research is needed, therefore, on the performance of advanced statistical techniques with different languages.

Reference-contexts: We conclude by summarizing the major results of our multilingual projects and indicating future research directions. The INQUERY Retrieval System The INQUERY retrieval engine used in the CIIR language experiments is based on a probabilistic model of retrieval using a Bayesian net framework <ref> (Turtle and Croft 1991) </ref>. The system has been used in a variety of research projects and applications, and it has been consistently very effective in the governmentsponsored TREC evaluations (Harman 1995).

Reference-contexts: In Chinese, the issue is even more challenging: there is no default punctuation to indicate word separation, so a character could be a whole word or only part of a multicharacter word <ref> (Wu and Tseng, 1993) </ref>. In order to identify the words in the text perfectly, it is necessary to understand the meaning of the text.
