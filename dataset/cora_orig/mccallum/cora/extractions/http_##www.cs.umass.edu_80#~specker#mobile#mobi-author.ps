Abstract: Internetworks of the future will allow and promote universal access. Network users will be able to access the network at a multitude of access points separated by significant geographic distance and many administrative boundaries. Lacking a single central authority, a new set of inter-domain security mechanisms is needed to allow users to migrate into remote domains while inheriting privileges from their home domain. Solutions addressing this issue must take into account a somewhat contradictory security constraint that calls for strict separation of security domains in order to avoid sharing sensitive security information among them. In this paper, we propose a solution for authenticating mobile users in remote domains that maintains the domain separation property. The protocols described herein can be applied in different mobile-user environments including wireless networks and mobile user services on traditional wireline networks.

Reference-contexts: In addition, some usability concerns are taken into account in order to offer a transparent user interface in remote domains. 4.1 Initial Assumptions When accessing the network in the home domain, the user is authenticated with a traditional server-based authentication mechanism such as Kerberos <ref> [3] </ref> or KryptoKnight [4]. Users of every network domain are registered with that domain's Authentication Server (AS). The AS of a domain can be replicated or partitioned within the domain but the set of all partitioned and duplicated ASs represent a single domain-level authority.

Users of every network domain are registered with that domain's Authentication Server (AS). The AS of a domain can be replicated or partitioned within the domain but the set of all partitioned and duplicated ASs represent a single domain-level authority. <p> These protocols are borrowed from KryptoKnight, an authentication and key distribution system prototype developed by IBM Research <ref> [4] </ref>. The reason for choosing KryptoKnight is twofold: * The existing KryptoKnight protocols have a number of qualities that make them attractive to build on. <p> In other words, the protocol's purpose is to establish a temporary foreign residence for a travelling user. 5 Refer to <ref> [4] </ref> and [16] for details. 6 All encryption is performed with K ab . 6 A B &gt; The following notation is used in the protocol and throughout the rest of this paper: * SU id, SU id Identification of the end-user U in different protocol flows. <p> All ticket fields appear in cleartext with the exception of the key, which is secured within a key token. A KryptoKnight-style key token <ref> [4] </ref>, in turn, is computed as: AU T H K rh (N r ; N h ; U ) L K ur . This construction insures that the key is protected from unauthorized disclosure.

We can even avoid using encryption by computing K ur as F (AS r ; U; K u ). Constructing K ur as described above has an important consequence that the user visting the same domain on two different occasions will continue using the same K ur .

Reference-contexts: This can provide the necessary separation between different visits to the same foreign domain. If K u is a weak key, e.g., a password or a PIN, the authentication token (regardless of its construction details) is subject to verifiable-plaintext attack <ref> [7, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This can not be accomplished without some interaction (perhaps, not direct) with the user's home domain, since only the home domain is able to comment on the user's current standing. Therefore, a plain solution with global user certification, such as the one employed by Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) <ref> [10] </ref>, is not applicable to the general mobile-user environment. Certificates can be still used for identifying users. It is the authorization of users that can not be solved with certificates alone.

Reference-contexts: User authentication involving a Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) must refer to the local Authentication Server. However, even though CDPD provides a detailed description and packet formats for inter-domain location update (see Mobile Network Location Protocol, <ref> [11] </ref> sections 500-501), no details as to the format of authentication information are provided. 4 Authentication of Mobile Users In this section we present a solution for the authentication of mobile users.

Reference-contexts: Another problem with using certificates (both public- and shared-key based) is the implied assumption that a user has some means of carrying a certificate, e.g., within a cellular phone, a personal communicator or a smartcard. However, in the simplest mobile-user environment (e.g., UPT <ref> [12] </ref>), a user is "armed" with only a password or a PIN|something that a human brain can easily retain. <p> The UPT design anticipates many types of fraudulent use and suggests some general solu-tions ranging from simple PIN-based authentication to more involved two-way authentication (user$UPT-equipment) using smartcards <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. However, unlike GSM, UPT has not matured to a state where specific security solutions have been proposed. Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)[11] architecture has been developed by a consortium of (mostly, US) companies. Like UPT, it envisions a network accessible through either mobile or fixed end-systems.

Reference-contexts: Like UPT, it envisions a network accessible through either mobile or fixed end-systems. However, instead of being a value-add service, it is a complete architecture encompassing, among other things, a complete MAC layer. The architecture supports several network layer protocols including IP [15] and CLNP <ref> [14] </ref>. CDPD specifications are not as vague as UPT about security requirements. In particular, CDPD requires a logically-separate entity, Authentication Server to be present in every service provider's domain. User authentication involving a Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) must refer to the local Authentication Server.

A user is normally registered with a home domain on a long-term basis; anyone wanting to contact a certain user will have to consult his home domain first.
