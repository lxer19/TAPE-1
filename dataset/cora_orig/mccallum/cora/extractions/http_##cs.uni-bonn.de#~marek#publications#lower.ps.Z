Title: Lower Time Bounds for Randomized Computation  
Author: Rusins Freivalds and Marek Karpinski 
Abstract: It is a fundamental problem in the randomized computation how to separate different randomized time or randomized space classes (c.f., e.g., [KV87, KV88]). We have separated randomized space classes below log n in [FK94]. Now we have succeeded to separate small randomized time classes for multi-tape 2-way Turing machines. Surprisingly, these "small" bounds are of type n + f (n) with f (n) not exceeding linear functions. This new approach to "sublinear" time complexity is a natural counterpart to sublinear space complexity. The latter was introduced by considering the input tape and the work tape as separate devices and distinguishing between the space used for processing information and the space used merely to read the input word from. Likewise, we distinguish between the time used for processing information and the time used merely to read the input word.

Reference-contexts: The adventages of randomized Turing machines over determinnistic machines have been studied early starting with <ref> [Fr75] </ref> where the sets of palindromes were proved to be computable by Monte Carlo off-line Turing machines much faster than by deterministic machines of the same type. Later similar results were obtained for space and reversal complexity for various types of machines [Fr83, Fr85, KF90]. <p> Probabilistic machines are interesting theoretical devices but they are rather remote from practical needs. Hence much more effort has been spent to study Monte Carlo machines. There have already been lower time bounds (constn 2 for Monte Carlo offline Turing machines to recognize palindromes <ref> [Fr75, Fr77] </ref>). On the other hand, these lower bounds employ the specific restrictions of the machine model. For multitape 2-way Turing machines, lower time bounds are weak even in the case of deterministic machines. In the case of Monte Carlo machines the situation is much worse.

Reference-contexts: For instance, it was proved in [SHL65] that DLOGLOGSPACE contains nonregular languages but every language recognizable in o (log log n) space even by nondeterministic Turing machines is regular. However there are regular languages recognizable by Monte Carlo 2-way Turing machines in constant space <ref> [Fr81] </ref>, and there are nontrivial space classes defined by log log log n, log log n, log fl n for Monte Carlo 2-way Turing machines [KV87]. In this section we prove some results motivating the naturalness of our approach to sublinear time complexity.
