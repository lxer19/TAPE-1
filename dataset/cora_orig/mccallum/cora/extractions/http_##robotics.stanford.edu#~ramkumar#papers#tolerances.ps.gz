Reference-contexts: Other previous work in the area of union/intersection computation is an integration of the linear time triangulation algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref> with the linear time map merging of [7], giving a space-time optimal solution. This paper is organized as follows. In section 1, we introduce the toleranced model and in section 2 we study the intersection of toleranced edges, the basic primitive. <p> However, from a practical point of view, the following boot-strapping algorithm may give satisfactory results: 1. First, get a rough estimate ~p ij of p ij as the fraction of points satisfying condition I over a sample of 'reasonable' size uniformly drawn in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 6 2. Use ~p ij in the estimator theorem (theorem 11.1) of [12] which in turn gives the sample size such that ~p ij is accurate within a factor * with a probability greater than 1 ffi.

Reference-contexts: Thirdly, we present several straightforward applications of our algorithms to feasibility of assembly and assembly sequencing. There is substantial literature related to computing union and intersection of polygons without tolerances. The work is motivated by theoretical as well as practical interest. The intersection algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> can be used to compute the trapezoidal decomposition of an arrangement of edges. This provides a union/intersection algorithm of simple polygons that runs in O ((m + n) log (m + n) + k).

Reference-contexts: Computing the exact value of this volume seems difficult since we do not have a description of its boundary. Getting an ("; ffi) approximation ~p ij of p ij using a Monte Carlo method (see <ref> [12, 4] </ref>) is also an open problem since -ij might in general be non-convex. However, from a practical point of view, the following boot-strapping algorithm may give satisfactory results: 1.

Reference-contexts: Models for toleracing and their role in product design have received substantial interest in the literature [16, 17, 15, 18, 11, 6]. However, their geometric properties have not been looked at extensively. Intersection volumes and surface areas for cylinders with tolerances are described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Planning the assembly of toleranced products is addressed in [9]. But basic operations such as intersection, union, convolution, and Minkowski sum of toleranced polygons have not yet been studied. The basic operations among these are the union and the intersection. <p> For space requirements, we omit the details and the reader is requested to refer to the cited papers. 6.1 Feasibility of assembly of two parts A simple but instructive real life example on how useful operations between toleranced objects is the following from <ref> [5] </ref>: a fly fishing reel consists of a spool mounted on high quality bearings spinning around a centre pin assembly. The hole in the centre of the reel has to be machined smaller than the bearing so that when the reel is pressed in place interference is observed.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it is easily checked that the two following points P 1 = <ref> [5:; 6:; 8; 48:; 3:; 6:; 14:] </ref> and P 2 = [5:; 7:; 9:19; 3:; 6:; 14:] belong to -ij but not their middle. <p> this latter pointer as the enext pointer and we show how to use Jordan sorting to derive the enext pointers from the pnext pointer. 4.2 Computing the intersections of the Jordan arc with a line segment For each edge of each polygon, we use the Jordan sorting algorithm described in <ref> [8] </ref>, to compute the sorted sequence of intersections along the edge starting from the sorted sequence of intersections along the intersecting polygon (the Jordan arc in the Jordan sorting algorithm).

The tolerance model we use was introduced in <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.2 Intersection of toleranced edges 2.2.1 Problem statement In dealing with geometric operations between toleranced polygons, a crucial step consists of intersecting toleranced edges. <p> of the interference zones, which provides feedback to the designer on how precisely the parts have to be milled depending on the type of material used (aluminum in this case). 6.2 Assembly sequencing As already mentioned in the introduction, results were obtained recently for assembly sequencing of toleranced assemblies in <ref> [9] </ref> that defines the tolerance model we use. Without mentioning the details, the authors propose two algorithms: -one that lists all the assembly sequences that are always feasible, whatever the tolerance values are -another that lists the sequences that may be feasible only for some combinations of the parameters.
