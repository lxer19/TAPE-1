Abstract: Skyscraper Broadcasting is a recently proposed statically scheduled broadcast technique for video-on-demand that addresses the network-I/O bottleneck to provide significantly superior performance over previous approaches. This paper defines a scheme for dynamically scheduling the objects that are broadcast on the skyscraper channels. The dynamic broadcasting scheme is designed to provide all clients with the precise time at which their requested object will be broadcast, or an upper bound on that time if the delay is small. New segment size progressions are proposed that not only improve dynamic scheduling, but also simplify the server disk layout problem and allow clients with inexpensive (single-tuner, limited storage) settops to receive skyscraper broadcasts. Preliminary simulation results show that the proposed dynamic scheme (1) provides factors of two or more improvement in mean client waiting time, (2) outperforms the static system with respect to variability in client waiting time, and (3) delivers reasonable service to clients with inexpensive settops while providing clients that have more expensive settops with a high level of service that is relatively isolated from detrimental performance impact from the diskless clients.

Reference-contexts: One motivation for dynamic skyscraper scheduling is that recent evaluation of conventional broadcasting schemes has shown that periodic broadcast of the hot objects on isolated groups of channels is not necessarily superior to dynamically scheduling all objects on all available channels <ref> [12] </ref>. Another motivation is that there may not be a clear distinction between hot and cold objects in many video-on-demand systems; furthermore, the particular objects that are most popular may change with the time of day or as new objects are installed. <p> First, recent results show that for fixed length objects, FCFS outperforms other scheduling algorithms such as maximum queue length first (MQL) or maximum factored queue length first (MFQ) if both the mean and the variability in client waiting time are considered <ref> [12] </ref>. Second, the broadcast assignment can be done when the request arrives, and thus the system can immediately inform the client when the broadcast will begin. Temporary Channel Stealing Several optimizations of the above dynamic skyscraper scheme are possible. <p> the dynamic skyscraper/FCFS combination. hot and cold sets also yields improved performance with respect to the maximum 1 Recall that, among the channel scheduling policies that have been proposed to date for conventional broadcasts, FCFS has the best performance when both mean and variability in client waiting time are considered <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 Note that using the sum of mean and maximum waiting time as the objective function when searching for the optimal partitioning of channels between the hot and cold classes produced configurations that had significantly lower mean waiting time for cold objects as compared with hot objects, so we simply
