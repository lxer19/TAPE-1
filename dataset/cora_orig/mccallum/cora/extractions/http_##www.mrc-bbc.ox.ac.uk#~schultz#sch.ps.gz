Reference-contexts: Most Schaf-fer collateral axons project into the stratum radiatum of CA1, although CA3 neurons proximal to CA1 tend to project into the stratum oriens <ref> (Ishizuka et al., 1990) </ref>; in the model these are assumed to have the same effect on the recipient pyramidal cells. Inhibitory interneurons are considered to act only as regulators of pyramidal cell activity.

Reference-contexts: This integral over the macroscopic parameters and their respective Lagrange multipliers is evaluated using the saddle-point ap proximation, which is exact in the limit of an infinite number of neurons <ref> (see, for example, Jeffreys and Jeffreys, 1972) </ref> to yield the expression given in Appendix A; the saddle-points of the expression must in general be found numerically. 4 How graded is information representation on the Schaffer collaterals?

Reference-contexts: The average mutual information is evaluated using the replica trick, which amounts to log P = lim (P n 1) (12) which involves a number of subtleties, for which <ref> (Mezard et al., 1987) </ref> can be consulted for a complete discussion. The important thing to note is that an assumption regarding replica symmetry is necessitated, and the stability of resulting solutions must be checked.

The input of the system could be considered to be the CA3 pattern during storage, , and the output the CA1 pattern during retrieval, U . <p> The core of the calculation then is the calculation of the probability density P (; U ) n+1 ff . The key to this is "self-consistent statistics" <ref> (Rolls and Treves, 1997, appendix 4) </ref>: all possible values of each firing rate in the system are inte grated, subject to a set of constraints that implement the model. The constraints are implemented using the integral form of the Dirac ffi-function.

It should be noted that in all these estimates, and particularly with larger brains, there is considerable error (L. Seress, personal communication).

Reference-contexts: This is where the contribution of the work described in this chapter lies. The analysis described in <ref> (Treves, 1995) </ref> assumed, for the purposes of simplicity of analysis, that the distribution of patterns of firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons was binary (and for one case ternary), although it considered threshold-linear (and thus analogue) model neurons. <p> Thus the strength of older memories fades exponentially with the number of intervening memories. The same forgetting model is assumed to apply to the CA3 network, and for this network, the maximum number of patterns can be stored when the plasticity fl CA3 0 = 2=C <ref> (Treves, 1995) </ref>. For the Hebbian term the specific form H ( i ; ~ j ) = p (~ j ~ 0 )( i h i i) (9) is used, where h ensures the normalisation given in Eq. 7. <p> It follows from the forgetting model defined by Eq. 6, that information transmission is maximal when the plasticity (mean square contribution of the modification induced by one pattern) is matched in the CA3 recurrent collaterals and the Schaffer collaterals <ref> (Treves, 1995) </ref>. <p> The solid line indicates the result for uniform connectivity, and the dashed line the two-tier convergence model with C j 2 f5000; 15000g. 5 Non-uniform Convergence It is assumed in <ref> (Treves, 1995) </ref> that there is uniform convergence of connections from CA3 to CA1 across the extent of the CA1 subfield. <p> The information is expressed in the figure as a fraction of the information present when the pattern is stored in CA3 (15). Two phenomena can be seen in the results. The first, as mentioned in the 10 previous section <ref> (and discussed at more length in Treves, 1995) </ref>, is that infor-mation transmission is maximal when the plasticity of the Schaffer collaterals is approximately matched with that of the preceding stage of information processing. The second phenomenon is the increase in information throughput with spread in the convergence about its mean.

Reference-contexts: The foundations of at least one such formalism were laid with the notion that the recurrent collateral connections of subregion CA3 of the hippocampus allow it to function as an autoassociative memory (Rolls, 1989, although many 1 of the ideas go back to Marr, 1971), and with subsequent quantitative analysis <ref> (reviewed in Treves and Rolls, 1994) </ref>. After the laying of foundations, it is important to begin erecting a structural framework. In this context, this refers to the modelling of further features of the hippocampal system, in a parsimonious and simplistic way.
