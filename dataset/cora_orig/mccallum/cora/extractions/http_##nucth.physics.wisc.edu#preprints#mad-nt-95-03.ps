Abstract: We calculate the effects of random density fluctuations on two-neutrino flavor transformations (-t() * ) -e ) in the post-core-bounce supernova environment. In particular, we follow numerically the flavor evolution of neutrino states propagating through a stochastic field of density fluctuations. We examine the approach to neutrino flavor depolarization, and study the effects of this phenomenon in both the early shock reheating epoch and the later r-process nucleosynthesis epoch. Our results suggest that significant fluctuation-induced neutrino flavor depolarization effects occur in these environments only when the zero-order (without density fluctautions) evolution of the neutrino states includes adiabatic propagation through resonances (mass level crossings). In the shock reheating epoch, depolarization

Reference-contexts: The density matrix of two-neutrino flavor evolution obeys the equation i dr where ^ a e (r) e (r); a fl 5 with a e and a t the probability amplitudes for the neutrino to be -e and -t , respectively, and where the Hamiltonian is given by <ref> [1] </ref> ^ H = ffim 2 4E 1 2 e (r)) z + ffim 2 4E ! In Eq. (5), ffim 2 is the vacuum neutrino mass-squared difference, E is the neutrino energy, N e and N r e are the averaged and randomly fluctuating parts of the electron number density, <p> First, we introduce the resonance width as ffir = 2H tan 2; (8) where the effective weak charge density scale height is H jd ln N e (r)=drj 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. We define ffim 2 =2E, where ffim 2 is the difference of the squares of the vacuum neutrino mass eigenvalues. With this notation, resonance (neutrino mass level crossing) occurs at the position where cos 2 = p satisfied.

Reference-contexts: The neutrino heating of the stalled shock has been examined by Fuller et al. <ref> [3] </ref> and Wilson and Mayle [4] including neutrino flavor-mixing effects. Flavor mixing between a light -e and or- t with a cosmologically significant mass in the range of 10-100 eV can increase the supernova explosion energy by up to 60%. <p> For the case of an adiabatic transition between the more energetic -t and less energetic -e , the heating rate can be increased by (30-60)% <ref> [3] </ref>. Therefore, the reduction of the transition probability by random fluctuation effects for an a priori reasonable rms value of the fluctuations [(0.05-0.1)%] could be important.

Reference-contexts: This increase in the average energy of -e by the MSW transformation also affects the possible r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in supernovae <ref> [5] </ref>. In the absence of flavor transitions, -e have a higher temperature than -e . This is due to the fact that the neutron-rich surface of the proto neutron star presents a greater opacity to -e than -e . <p> Therefore, -e decouple deeper in the proto neutron star than -e , and hence, are hotter. Due to their lack of charged current interactions (at these energies) with nucleons, and- t are even hotter than -e . As pointed out by Qian et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, an MSW transition can result in a proton production rate which is greater than the neutron production rate at the proposed r-process site. <p> As shown in Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>, the neutrino-heated supernova ejecta must have a neutron excess (Y e &lt; 0:5) in order for any r-process nucleosynthesis to be produced. In Ref. [5], it was shown that the electron fraction Y e is approximately given by Y e 1 + -e p = en 1 ; (16) where <p> As shown in Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>, the neutrino-heated supernova ejecta must have a neutron excess (Y e &lt; 0:5) in order for any r-process nucleosynthesis to be produced. In Ref. [5], it was shown that the electron fraction Y e is approximately given by Y e 1 + -e p = en 1 ; (16) where -e p and en are the reaction rates for -e + p ! e + + n; (17) respectively, and hE -e i and hE <p> Consider simple estimates for Y e using Eq. (16) for four cases: (1) No flavor mixing. In this case, we have Y e 1=(1 + hE -e i=hE -e i) 1=(1 + 16=11) 0:41, so the material is neutron rich, in good agreement with detailed supernova model calculations <ref> [5] </ref>. (2) Full flavor conversion. In this case, we have hE -e i * ) hE ti, so that Y e 1=(1 + hE -e i=hE ti) 1=(1 + 16=25) 0:61; and the material is very proton rich. (3) Complete neutrino flavor depolarization. <p> In fact, to get Y e &lt; 0:45 we need to demand that there had been less than 15% flavor conversion. Consider some condition along the Y e = 0:5 line in Fig. 2 of Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>. For example, consider E - = 25 MeV and ffim 2 900 eV 2 , for which the density scale height at resonance is H 0:5 km. This value of ffim 2 corresponds to sin 2 2 4 fi 10 6 on the Y e = 0:5 line. <p> Note that fluctuation-induced depolarization at a level of 50% could conceivably produce more conversion than MSW transformation at E - = 25 MeV over a considerable part of the region to the right of the Y e = 0:5 line in Fig. 2 of Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>. As outlined above, greater than 30% flavor conversion will always drive the material too proton rich for r-process. <p> If one calculates Y e for these parameters in the absence of fluctuations, one obtains Y e = 0:5 indicating that this point lies on the boundary of the excluded region of the MSW parameter space <ref> [5] </ref>. The inclusion of noise at the 1% level would decrease Y e by about 1%. Random fluctuations of 0.5% as in Fig. 2 (b) would give a decrease of about 0.4%. <p> The effect of the noise is large in the adiabatic region only and becomes increasingly negligible as the neutrino flavor transition becomes nonadiabatic. A 1% fluctuation will decrease Y e from 0:5 to ~ 0:495 for points in the MSW parameter space on the boundary of the excluded region <ref> [5] </ref>. However, we consider this rms fluctuation value to be actually too large for the relatively quiesent TPB &gt; 3 s epoch. For an order of magnitude smaller fluctuation which may be more reasonable, the effect of the noise is totally ignorable. <p> For an order of magnitude smaller fluctuation which may be more reasonable, the effect of the noise is totally ignorable. In other words, noise at the 0.1% level will not alter the region of the neutrino mixing parameter 14 space excluded in Ref. <ref> [5] </ref> by the MSW effect. Noise with an rms amplitude of 0.05% of the averaged local matter density can lead to significant neutrino flavor decoherence during the shock reheating epoch at TPB ~ 0:15 s.

Suppressing the degree of flavor transition has the effect of lowering the average energy of -e compared with the average energy they would have had for an MSW transition in the absence of the noise.

Reference-contexts: Noisy mixing of matter could also mimic a fluctuating matter density. A priori, fluctuations in the matter density may be well approximated by random noise (which averages to zero) added to the average value of the density. In Ref. <ref> [10] </ref>, a differential equation for the averaged survival probability was derived for the case in which the random noise was taken to be a delta-correlated Gaussian distribution. <p> In order to obtain this approximation, one can transform ^ to the interaction picture, express ^ I as an iterative expansion and explicitly perform the averaging to obtain <ref> [10] </ref> h^ I (r)i = 2 1 X (1) n dR (2n)F (2n) ^ C (2n); (9) where Z dR (2n) 0 Z r 1 dr 2 0 F (2n) f 123 (2n1)(2n) ; (11) and ^ M = (G F =2 2) ^ U 0 z ^ U 0 , <p> The reason the approximation works as well as it does is that for both t c L res and t c t L res , the approximation and the numerically-averaged simulation approach the probability in the absence of fluctuations. As discussed in Ref. <ref> [10] </ref>, the parameter fl = 1=2G 2 F h (N r e ) 2 it c ffir governs the size of the effect of the fluctuations when t c t L res .

Reference-contexts: It was also shown that if the correlation length of the matter density fluctuations was small compared to the neutrino oscillation length at resonance, one obtained the same result as for the case of a delta-correlated Gaussian. Here, we consider the more realistic case of colored noise <ref> [11] </ref>. We find that the random fluctuations have the largest effect on the flavor transition when the correlation length is on the order of the neutrino oscillation length at resonance, and that the fluctuations, on average, have the effect of suppressing the flavor transition. <p> We now proceed to a detailed description of how we follow numerically the time evolution of the neutrino density matrix [i.e., Eq. (3)]. Provided one 6 has access to a random number generator which generates Gaussian deviates, Eq. (3) can be integrated by the method of Ref. <ref> [11] </ref> with the probabilities calculated and averaged. However, such a process can be quite time consuming.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, an averaging such as given in Eq. (15) is common in other physical situations when many coupled channels are present. For example, in multidimensional dissipative quantum tunnelling, barrier transmission probability is given by a similar formula when the number of channels gets very large <ref> [12] </ref>. Note that to first order in x, the change N e (r) ! (1 + x)N e (r) in the functional form of the density will affect the survival probability via a change in the slope of the density at resonance.
