Abstract: Many high-performance applications demand that machines execute rapid and precise point-to-point motions. In order to achieve these motions, time-optimal command profiles can typically be employed. This work presents a strategy for deriving time-optimal commands that takes into account all possible types of system denominator dynamics. Unlike other approaches, the method presented here can account for real modes as well as rigid-body and flexible modes. Since this is a more general strategy for deriving time-optimal commands, results illustrate that this technique always meets or exceeds the performance of existing methods. 1 . Introduction In many classes of high-performance equipment, speed of response is the primary metric of performance. In disk drives, for example, the read-write head must position quickly from one track to the next in order to ensure high-speed data access. Similarly, in current amplifiers, rapid transitions between setpoints are essential for effective operation. For every open or closed-loop system with bounded inputs, an optimal input command profile exists that will move the system output from one point to another as fast as possible. For linear systems with rigid-body dynamics, these commands are straightforward to derive. However, as systems are designed to be lighter and more responsive, non-rigid dynamics can appear which impede further performance enhancements. For example, sluggish response or problematic vibration may limit the point-to-point response speed of the system output. In order to address this problem, strategies have been proposed recently for deriving time-optimal commands that suppress system vibration [1, 5, 9, 13, 14]. None of these methods, however, address the importance of real modes in deriving optimal commands. This paper proposes a general approach for deriving time-optimal commands for systems with any type of denominator dynamics. The framework proposed here can not only replicate previous results for systems with solely flexible or rigid-body modes, but can also be extended to systems with any combination of real, flexible, or rigid-body dynamics. Additionally, this general approach employs a simplified matrix notation which streamlines the derivation of time-optimal commands. Results from this work illustrate that, in order to achieve the fastest possible This paper begins with a statement of the time-optimal control problem followed by some background about the nature of time-optimal commands. The general approach for deriving optimal commands is then presented by looking at three simple cases. For each of these three cases, analytic solutions to the time-optimal command problem are presented. From these results, a general approach for creating time-optimal commands is outlined and supported by a simple example. 2 . The Problem Statement Before a strategy can be proposed for creating time-optimal motion profiles, the problem must be presented in a clear and well-posed form. The task we propose to address is illustrated in figure 1 and can be stated as follows: In this problem statement, the system, G(s), is assumed to be a single-input, single-output linear model, and there are two constraints placed on the problem solution: (1) the optimal motion profile must remain within actuator limits and (2) it must move the system output the desired amount. These two constraints represent the minimum subset of possible constraints required to ensure a non-trivial solution. Note that, in this problem statement, the system under consideration can be open or closed-loop, and the output response does not necessarily have to be a change in position; it can be a change in velocity, force, or any other system variable of interest.

Reference-contexts: For example, sluggish response or problematic vibration may limit the point-to-point response speed of the system output. In order to address this problem, strategies have been proposed recently for deriving time-optimal commands that suppress system vibration <ref> [1, 5, 9, 13, 14] </ref>. None of these methods, however, address the importance of real modes in deriving optimal commands. This paper proposes a general approach for deriving time-optimal commands for systems with any type of denominator dynamics. <p> This procedure is enumerated below: 1. Select an optimal command profile. As discussed in section 3, the Bang-Bang Principle dictates that the value of the optimal command will always be either the upper or lower actuator limit. However, as noted by Ben-Asher <ref> [1] </ref>, the exact number of switches and the initial sign of the optimal command is not known. <p> A numerical optimization of the constraint equations will not always guarantee that the time-optimal solution will be found; in some cases, a suboptimal local minimum will be returned. In order to verify the optimality of the solution, a sufficiency condition can be employed as outlined in Ben-Asher <ref> [1] </ref>, Pao [8], or Singhose [15]. In the case where this sufficiency condition indicates that the solution is suboptimal, the optimization can be rerun with a different initial guess, a higher number of impulses, or a change in the initial sign of the command until an optimal solution is reached.
