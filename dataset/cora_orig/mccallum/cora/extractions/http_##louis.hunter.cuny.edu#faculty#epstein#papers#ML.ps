Abstract: This paper appeared in 1994 in Machine Learning, 15 (3): 251-277. Abstract This paper demonstrates how the nature of the opposition during training affects learning to play two-person, perfect information board games. It considers different kinds of competitive training, the impact of trainer error, appropriate metrics for post-training performance measurement, and the ways those metrics can be applied. The results suggest that teaching a program by leading it repeatedly through the same restricted paths, albeit high quality ones, is overly narrow preparation for the variations that appear in real-world experience. The results also demonstrate that variety introduced into training by random choice is unreliable preparation, and that a program that directs its own training may overlook important situations. The results argue for a broad variety of training experience with play at many levels. This variety may either be inherent in the game or introduced deliberately into the training. Lesson and practice training, a blend of expert guidance and knowledge-based, self-directed elaboration, is shown to be particularly effective for learning during competition.

In Proceedings of the Seventh 15 One might expect, however, that in some games with a larger branch factor, the probability of making a suboptimal choice, rather than a terrible one, would decrease, so that lack of foresight and knowledge in a trainer would be less damaging to learning than random noise would be. The potential tradeoff between partial knowledge and the ways it might lead the learner astray seems worth some additional exploration. </title> <booktitle> International Conference on Machine Learning. </booktitle> <editor> Ed.
