Abstract: In this paper, we describe a generative process planning system for robotic sheet metal bending press-brakes. This process planning system employs a distributed planning architecture. Currently, our system consists of a central operation planner and three specialized domain specific planners: tooling, grasping, and moving. The central operation planner proposes various alternative partial sequences and each specialized planner evaluates them based on its objective function. The central operation planner uses state-space search techniques to optimize the operation sequence. Once a CAD design is given for a new part, the system automatically determines: the operation sequence, the tools and robot grippers needed, the tool layout, the grasp positions, the gage and the robot motion plans for making the part. The distributed architecture allows us to develop an open-architecture environment for doing generative process planning and encapsulate the specialized knowledge in specialized planners.

Surveys of various systems and techniques can be found in <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. Chang's book on process planning [7] provides an excellent introduction to main issues, challenges, and techniques being used in automated process planning systems. Most existing process planning systems primarily focus on machining (e.g., milling, drilling, and turning operations).

Reference-contexts: The central planner keeps track of the query results and develops a near optimal plan. Specialized planners act as servers, which solve problems in grasping, tooling and moving for given partial operation sequences. Note that all of the planners communicate in the Feature Exchange Language (FEL) <ref> [5] </ref>, which is a human readable, extendible language. This FEL syntax is regular, human readable and easily processed by each module. In our system, the part's design is presented to the planning system, which automatically plans all aspects of the setup and the execution steps for making the part. <p> For geometric modeling and reasoning we have used NOODLES geometric kernel [14]. For graphical interface we have used HOOPS graphics library [18]. All message passing among planners is accomplished by Feature Exchange Language <ref> [5] </ref>. On average parts (8 to 12 bends), our system produces process plans in less than 5 minutes on a 200 MHz Pentium workstation. Our system has been tested with over two hundred of low to high complexity industrial parts.

Reference-contexts: Process planning and part programming time directly affect the lot sizes that can be economically produced on these cells. We believe that automated 1 process planning systems can significantly enhance the throughput of such integrated cells and dramatically lower the economic lot sizes <ref> [6] </ref>. Depending upon the level of process plan details, the process planning systems can be divided into two different types: macro planners and micro planners. Macro planners deal with the higher level process planning decisions such as selection of machines, selection of operation types, ordering operations, selection of tools etc. <p> Distributed Architecture for Process Planning: Distributed problem solving techniques have been used in in the following two process planning systems. NEXTCUT [9, 10] is 6 a process planning system for machining and it uses specialized agents to solve the pieces of the planning problem.

Reference-contexts: However, the solution found by A* is sub-optimal only by the over-predicted amount. In our case, using admissible heuristics leads to exploration of 1 A best-first search algorithm with prediction heuristics for estimating cost to the goal state from the current state (for details please see Nilsson's book <ref> [20] </ref>) 10 large search space. Therefore, we are using inadmissible heuristics. Our current heuristics predict very close to the actual cost and as a result we get near-optimal solutions.
