Abstract: A two dimensional time-dependent Duffing oscillator model of macroscopic neocortex exhibits chaos for some ranges of parameters. We embed this model in moderate noise, typical of the context presented in real neocortex, using PATHINT, a non-Monte-Carlo path-integral algorithm that is particularly adept in handling nonlinear Fokker-Planck systems. This approach shows promise to investigate whether chaos in neocortex, as predicted by such models, can survive in noisy contexts.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION A global theory of neocortical dynamic function at macroscopic scales was developed to explain salient features of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from human scalp <ref> [1] </ref>. In some limiting cases, the theory predicts EEG standing wav es composed of linear combinations of spatial modes. These modes (which may be called order parameters in the parlance of modern dynamical methods) are governed by linear or quasilinear ordinary differential equations [1-3]. <p> These modes (which may be called order parameters in the parlance of modern dynamical methods) are governed by linear or quasilinear ordinary differential equations [1-3]. These data and theoretical works suggest several connections to reports of chaotic attractors estimated for EEG data <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to illuminate possible relations between sub-macroscopic chaos (for example in neocortical columns) and large scale data observed at the scalp, we suggested a simple metaphoric system, the linear stretched string with nonlinear attached springs [4-6].

Reference-contexts: However, a relatively simple physical system in which the general issues of spatial scale interaction and connection to experimental EEG can be discussed with minimal complication is a linear stretched string with attached nonlinear springs <ref> [4] </ref>. The ends of the string may be considered fixed or the string may form a closed loop to make the system more analogous to the closed neocortical/corticocortical fiber surface. A closed loop of transmission line with nonlinear dielectric conductance is the equivalent electric system.

Reference-contexts: Duffing model - 4 - Ingber, Srinivasan and Nunez Duffing's equation at x = x 0 , F + a t 2 3 The alternative way to arrive at Duffing's equation is to do a spatial mode expansion of the string equation and then only keep the lowest wav enumber <ref> [6] </ref>. For instance, the Lorenz system is derived in this way from the atmospheric turbulence equations [13]. This equation has been studied numerically for the case w 0 = 0 in the parameter space (a , B) using spectral analysis and phase-plane projections [7].

Reference-contexts: In the limiting case when string tension is zero, the forced Duffing equation is obtained. The Duffing equation exhibits a rich dynamic behavior of periodic and chaotic motion, for different parameters (associated with different wav e numbers in the string-spring system) <ref> [7] </ref>. Another series of papers has outlined a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), demonstrating that the statistics of synaptic and neuronal interactions develops a stochastic background of moderate noise that survives up to the macroscopic scales that are typically measured by scalp EEG [4,8-12]. <p> For instance, the Lorenz system is derived in this way from the atmospheric turbulence equations [13]. This equation has been studied numerically for the case w 0 = 0 in the parameter space (a , B) using spectral analysis and phase-plane projections <ref> [7] </ref>. A rich structure of periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motion were reported. We duplicated Ueda's results using a standard fifth and sixth order Runge-Kutta algorithm (IMSL routine DIVPRK).

Reference-contexts: For example, the coarser resolution is appropriate, typically required, for numerical solution of the time-dependent path integral. By considering the contributions to the first and second moments conditions on the time, variable meshes can be derived <ref> [16] </ref>. The time slice essentially is determined by Dt L -1 , where L is the uniform Lagrangian, respecting ranges giving the most important contributions to the probability distribution P. Thus, Dt is roughly measured by the diffusion divided by the square of the drift.

Reference-contexts: Since integration is inherently a smoothing process <ref> [21] </ref>, fitting data with the short-time probability distribution, effectively using an integral over this epoch, permits the use of coarser meshes than the corresponding stochastic differential equation. For example, the coarser resolution is appropriate, typically required, for numerical solution of the time-dependent path integral.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Dt is roughly measured by the diffusion divided by the square of the drift. Monte Carlo algorithms for path integrals are well known to have extreme difficulty in evolving nonlinear systems with multiple optima <ref> [26] </ref>, but this algorithm does very well on such systems. The PATHINT code was tested against the test problems given in previous one-dimensional systems [16,17]. Tw o-dimensional runs were tested by using cross products of one-dimensional examples whose analytic solutions are known. 5.

Reference-contexts: Then, we can compare the chaos and non-chaos topologies of the deterministic system, which have been seen above to (barely) be different, to the topologies of the stochastic system. The topology of chaotic systems is an important invariant that often can be used to identify its presence <ref> [27] </ref>. A mesh of Dt = 0. 1 within ranges of -x, y- of -25 was reasonable to calculate the evolution of this system for all runs. To be sure of accuracy in the calculations, off-diagonal spreads of meshes were taken as -5 increments.
