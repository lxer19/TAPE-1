Abstract: desktop computer in minutes. The result is a reduction in dimension from d = 16; 384 through d 0 = 400 to d 00 = 10. Lawrence Sirovich of Brown University provided the normalized face images used in the "mug's gallery" application. Amir Auerbuch of Technion programmed the computation of Karhunen-Loeve eigenvectors for the reduced parameter set. This research was supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the National Science Foundation, and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
