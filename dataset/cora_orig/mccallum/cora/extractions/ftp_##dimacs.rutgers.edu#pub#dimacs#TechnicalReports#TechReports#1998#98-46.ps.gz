Reference-contexts: The proof technique in Theorem 1.1 employs the method of conditional probabilities for derandomizing a probabilistic proof. For more on the probabilistic method, see Alon, Spencer and Erd-os <ref> [3] </ref>, and also Raghavan [19]. Moreover, we easily extend the above result from bipartite graphs to arbitrary graphs in the following form: Theorem 1.2 Let G = (V; E) be a t-partite graph on n vertices and m edges, where the partite sets are given. <p> f), if and only if, the left boundary of M 2 is greater than the right boundary of M 1 (right boundary of M 2 is less than the left boundary of M 1 ). 2 We refere the reader to [9] for basic concepts on probability theory and to <ref> [3] </ref> for the probabilistic methods. For any random variable X, let E [X] denote the expected value of X. <p> Therefore, Theorem 2.1 implies the previous probabilistic result. The main result of this section is to construct a suitable linear drawing using a deterministic polynomial time algorithm. Applying the method of conditional probabilities <ref> [3] </ref> for removing the randomness in Theorem 2.1 requires counting the number of matchings of different size which is a #P-complete problem [23]. Nevertheless, we avoid the direct enumeration of matchings in the original graph to turn our probabilistic proof into a deterministic algorithm.

(The fact that any edge pair can cross only once is crucial to this observation.) By Dilworth's Theorem <ref> [7] </ref>, the minimum number of chains the edges can be partitioned to equals the size of the largest anti-chain, and thus, the claim on the number of pages follows.

The following simple result regarding the structure of the crossing sets (twists) and the disjoint sets (rainbows) was noted by Heath and Rosenberg <ref> [12] </ref>.
