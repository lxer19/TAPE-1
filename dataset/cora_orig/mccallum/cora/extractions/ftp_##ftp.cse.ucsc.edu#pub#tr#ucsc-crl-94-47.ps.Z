Reference-contexts: Already they have led to exciting applications in signal analysis and numerical analysis, and many other. This wide applicability also contributes to the interest they generate. Unfortunately, the two most well known monographs on wavelets by Daubechies [2] and Chui <ref> [1] </ref> are still unaccessible to a beginner due to the level of mathematical sophistication needed to go through these monographs. Moreover both these monographs introduce wavelets from a signal processing perspective. The objective here is to introduce wavelets via scaling functions using the theory of multiresolution analysis. <p> Wavelets on Real Line 2. Wavelets on Real Line This chapter first defines scaling functions, multiresolution analysis, wavelets and reconstruction and decomposition relations and algorithms. Then we present following examples of wavelets: Haar wavelets, B-spline wavelets and Daubechies wavelets. These related topics are discussed in great detail by Chui <ref> [1] </ref> and Daubechies [2]. 2.1 Fundamentals In this section, after presenting some elementary results from linear algebra, we review some basic definitions and useful properties of scaling functions, multiresolution analysis and wavelets. <p> For pathological cases, see <ref> [1] </ref>. However in this monograph we shall restrict our attention to only those scaling functions which do generate MRA, that is they do satisfy those properties above. <p> Compact support supp (x) = supp (x) = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (2.33) 3. Symmetry/Anti-symmetry (a) Haar scaling function is symmetric (b) Haar wavelet is anti-symmetric 4. Analytic expressions are available 5. Have vanishing moments Z 1 1 6. <p> These will be referred to as B-spline wavelets. The two-scale relation for B-spline wavelets for general order m is given by m (x) = k=0 where q k = (1) k 2 1m l=0 m ! For the derivation of the two-scale relation, refer to <ref> [1] </ref> section 6.2. 2.3.4 Properties of the wavelets The B-spline wavelets have several nice properties [5][1], some of which we mention below: 1. There exists analytic expressions for B-spline wavelets as in (2.43) and (2.44) above. 2. <p> Non-zero values of N m (k) k 2 Z for some small m are summarized in Table 2.1 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> In general, two-scale se quence fp k g for any scaling functions has the property: X p 2k = k There is no closed form for D 3 (x). However the display algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> can be used to draw the graph of D 3 (x). 2.7.2 Wavelets The two-scale relation for the Daubechies wavelets is in the form: (x) D X q k D where q k = (1) k p k+1 (2.88) and p k+1 is the complex conjugate of p k+1 . <p> Linear Legendre Wavelets 29 3.1 Linear Legendre Wavelets Our first concrete examples of wavelets on a bounded interval are Linear Legendre bases. 3.1.1 Scaling functions We define a pair of Linear Legendre scaling functions 0 (x)and 1 (x) on a bounded interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as ( 1 (x) = 3 (2x 1) for 0 x &lt; 1 and they are shown in Figure 3.1. The integer translates of 0 (x) and 1 (x) together span a subspace V 0 . <p> The 1=2 scaled version of 0 (x) and 1 (x) whose translates span the subspace V 1 such that V 0 V 1 are given by ( 2 x &lt; k+1 1 (2x k) = 3 (4x 2k 1) for k 2 : fined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and 1 (2x 1) First, let us study the two-scale relations for Linear Legendre scaling functions. <p> Let 0 (x) and 1 (x) be wavelets defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which are corresponding to Linear Legendre scaling functions. Using the two-scale relations for wavelets, 0 (x) and 1 (x) should be expressed in terms of i (2x) and i (2x1) for i = 0; 1. <p> Noting that (x) is zero outside <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the orthonormal condition (3.10) can be decomposed into 3 explicit equations; 1 for orthogonality 0 (x)? 1 (x) and 2 for normality of 0 (x) and 1 (x), which are summarized in Table 3.1. Now we need 5 more conditions to determine 8 unknowns uniquely. <p> We use as many as 5 vanishing moment conditions; 2 for 0 (x) and 3 for 1 (x) shown also in Table 3.1. Note that the translate factors are omitted for simplicity as any function described here vanishes outside <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 0 1 vanishing Z 1 0 (x)dx = 0 1 moments Z 1 0 (x)xdx = 0 1 orthogonality Z 1 0 (x) 1 (x)dx = 0 1 normality Z 1 f 0 (x)g 2 dx = 1 1 Table 3.1: Conditions to be used to determine the Linear <p> Wavelets on a Bounded Interval 3.4 First Order Flatlet Wavelets The m-th order Flatlet [8] basis functions consist of a set of m + 1 piecewise unit constant functions defined on a bounded interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The simplest example (m = 0) for the Flatlet family is identical to the Haar wavelets which we presented in the previous Chapter. <p> In this sectoin we start our example with first order Flatlet scaling functions (m = 1) and their wavelets. 3.4.1 Scaling functions The first order Flatlet basis functions are given as a pair of constant functions 0 (x) and 1 (x) on a bounded interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as ( 2 2 x &lt; 1 and they are shown in Figure 3.15.

Let 0 (x) and 1 (x) be wavelets defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which are corresponding to the first order Flatlet scaling functions. Introducing two-scale sequence fqg, the two-scale relations for wavelets are in the same form as (3.9). <p> Second Order Flatlet Wavelets 45 3.5 Second Order Flatlet Wavelets We continue the examples of the Flatlet family. In this section, we will present the second order Flatlet wavelets. 3.5.1 Scaling functions The second order Flatlet scaling functions consist of three piecewise basis functions defined in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> shown in Figure 3.19. 8 &gt; : 3 3 x &lt; 2 2 (x) = 1 for 2 (3.57) and 2 (x) 1 (2x) and 2 (2x) Their translates 0 (x k), 1 (x k) and 2 (x k), k 2 Z span a subspace V 0 . <p> And then we will give procedures to obtain the solutions to their corresponding wavelets. 3.6.1 Scaling functions The m-th order Flatlet scaling functions are defined as a set of m + 1 unit constant functions 0 (x); : : :; m (x) divided equally into m + 1 intervals on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : m+1 i (x) = 1 for i m+1 m (x) = 1 for m (3.65) Because of the simplicity of the Flatlet scaling functions, the two-scale relations for general order Flatlet scaling functions are easily obtained in the following

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Wavelets have been very successful in many scientific and engineering fields. There are several reasons for their present success <ref> [2] </ref>. On the one hand, the concept of wavelets can be viewed as a synthesis of ideas which originated during the last twenty or thirty years in engineering, physics, and pure mathematics. As a consequence of these interdisciplinary origins, wavelets appeal to scientists and engineers of many different backgrounds. <p> Already they have led to exciting applications in signal analysis and numerical analysis, and many other.
