Title: On the Use of Taxonomies for Representing Case Features and Local Similarity Measures

Abstract: For defining attribute types to be used in the case representation, taxonomies occur quite often. The symbolic values at any node of the taxonomy tree are used as attribute values in a case or a query. A taxonomy type represents a relationship between the symbols through their position within the taxonomy-tree which expresses knowledge about the similarity between the symbols. This paper analyzes several situations in which taxonomies are used in different ways and proposes a systematic way of specifying local similarity measures for taxonomy types. The proposed similarity measures have a clear semantics and are easy to compute at run time.

Reference-contexts: These three rules of thumb can be used as guidelines within a similarity definition method of a case-based reasoning methodology <ref> (Bergmann et al., 1997) </ref>. In our discussion, we restricted ourselves to taxonomies of basic objects which dont have an internal structure. However, our considerations also apply to the generalization/specialization hierarchy of the object classes in an objectoriented data (or case) model.

Reference-contexts: Unlike a plain symbol type, which only lists possible attribute values, a taxonomy represents an additional relationship between the symbols through their position within the taxonomy-tree. This relationship expresses knowledge about the similarity of the symbols in the taxonomy. The case representation language CASUEL <ref> ( Manago, Bergmann, et al. 1994) </ref> includes such a taxonomy type, which is very often used for modeling a CBR application. For example, the classification of marine sponges application contains a taxonomy of body forms of sponges and the PC configuration domain contains a taxonomy of PC components.

Reference-contexts: Although taxonomies are widely used, there is currently no clear picture of what knowledge about local similarities is captured in a taxonomy. The impression that similarity measures are usually constructed in an ad hoc manner <ref> ( Osborne & Bridge, 1996) </ref> also holds for local similarity measures for taxonomy type attributes. This paper analyzes several situations in which taxonomies are used in different ways and proposes a systematic way of specifying local similarity measures for taxonomy types. <p> Please note that this constraint defines an ordinal similarity measure, i.e., if the value K is given in the query, a partial order of all cases is induced. A similar approach can be also found in <ref> (Osborne and Bridge, 1996) </ref>. 3.4 Assigning Similarity Values for Leaf Nodes The taxonomy only represents the constraint shown above, but does not define numeric values for the similarity between two leaf node objects.

Reference-contexts: bottom up fashion: for each attribute, a local similarity measure determines the similarity between two attribute values and for each object (and the case) a global similarity measure determines the similarity between two objects (or between the case and the query) based on the local similarities of the belonging attributes <ref> (Wess, 95) </ref>. For defining attribute types (sets of possible attribute values), taxonomies are widely used. A taxonomy is an nary tree in which the nodes represent symbolic values. The symbols at any node of the tree can be used as attribute values in a case or a query.
