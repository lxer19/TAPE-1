Abstract: Network support for variable bit-rate video needs to consider (i) properties of workload induced (e.g., significant auto-correlations into far lags and different marginal distributions among connections) and (ii) application specific bounds on delay-jitter and statistical cell-loss probabilities. The objective of this paper is to present a quality-of-service solution for such traffic at each multiplexing point in the network. Heterogeneity in both offered workload and quality-of-service needs are addressed. The paper has several parts: (i) motivation for the proposed architecture, including an empirical model for selected queue statistics when the input process is a fractionally-differenced ARIMA(1; d; 0) process and the server is work conserving; (ii) a framing-strategy with active cell-discard to address the impact of inter-frame dependencies that would otherwise increase queue lengths, while simultaneously providing delay-jitter bounds; (iii) a pseudo earliest-due-date cell dispatcher for resolving competing deadlines, addressing cell-loss bounds and fairness across virtual circuits, and maximizing output-channel efficiency; (iv) upper bounds on equivalent bandwidth needed for heterogeneous delay-jitter bounds and heterogeneous cell-loss probabilities for traffic with heterogeneous arrival statistics. This paper assimilates and builds on the results of a number of authors, notably those of Golestani (Stop-and-Go framing), Garrett and Willinger and Pancha and El Zarki (variable bit-rate video traffic models and related multiplexor performance studies), and Yang and Pan (optimal space-conserving loss schedulers). fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant NCR-9396299, and by Hitachi Telecom USA, Inc. (HITEL). Results in Sections 2 and 3.2 were presented at the IEEE INFOCOM Conference in April 1995.

As pointed out by Garrett and Willinger <ref> [9] </ref>, a possible reason for this is that, for large d; the input sequence is persistent, so when it exceeds the service rate, it may do so for an extended period of time with a significant probability. <p> 1 &lt; 1:0; 0 &lt; d &lt; 1=2: Further, a 3 was significantly larger than a 2 : * The coefficient of variation of number of arrivals in a time-interval played a role in determining utilizations achievable for a given value of expected cell-loss, corroborating results of Garrett and Willinger <ref> [9] </ref>. * Increased buffer size did not significantly decrease cell-loss probabilities, especially for a long memory process, and less so if its coefficient of variation was large. In comparison, the cell loss probability for a white noise process or one with short memory decreased rapidly with increased buffer size. <p> An example process that exhibits this property is the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) process where fl k is a sum of exponentials. Studies by Beran et al, Garrett and Willinger and Pancha and El Zarki <ref> [3, 9, 27] </ref> indicate that long-range dependence is to be expected in variable-bit-rate video traffic. <p> Studies by Beran et al, Garrett and Willinger and Pancha and El Zarki [3, 9, 27] indicate that long-range dependence is to be expected in variable-bit-rate video traffic. The Hurst coefficient, H; defined as (1 fi=2); was estimated in <ref> [9] </ref> as between 0:75 and 0:88: An implication is that, even if traffic were aggregated over long time periods, the net aggregate will not appear as white noise. Instead, the aggregate will have bursty sub-periods and less bursty sub-periods for small as well as large time-scales.

Reference-contexts: If sufficient capacity is available to transmit these cells over the next frame, the cells have a delay-jitter bound equal to jT j and maximum delay bound equal to 2H T + t <ref> [10, p. 11] </ref>, where H is the number of hops in a connection's path, and t is one-way end-to-end propagation delay. Stop-and-Go Queuing was originally intended to guarantee that a traffic stream that was (r; T )-smooth 1 at a network entry point remained (r; T )-smooth over intermediate hops. <p> This was achieved by ensuring that traffic over successive frames (time intervals) did not get bunched together; frame n cells of a virtual circuit were never to contend for bandwidth with frame n + k; k &gt; 0; of the same virtual circuit.

Frame times needed to be integer multiples of a base frame-time, and they needed to be synchronized across virtual circuits.

Reference-contexts: This is because such traffic significantly increases queue length statistics at a multiplexor <ref> [1, 6, 9, 19, 20, 21, 26] </ref>. With the help of a fractionally differenced ARIMA (1; d; 0) model for the input process, we study through simulations, the queue length process at a work-conserving server with infinite and finite buffers and varying levels of mean server utilization.

Reference-contexts: The network is assumed to be cell-switched with virtual circuits similar to the Asynchronous Transfer Mode. Detailed specifications of the ATM protocol are, however, not necessary for functioning of the mechanisms proposed. Correlated traffic and implications Recent studies <ref> [3, 8, 9, 27] </ref> on a range of video applications indicate that there exists a slowly decaying auto-correlation structure in the underlying stochastic processes that constitute VBR video applications. <p> An example process that exhibits this property is the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) process where fl k is a sum of exponentials. Studies by Beran et al, Garrett and Willinger and Pancha and El Zarki <ref> [3, 9, 27] </ref> indicate that long-range dependence is to be expected in variable-bit-rate video traffic.

Reference-contexts: However, for a workload ( 1 = 0:4; d = 0:4), and the same mean cell loss, an example allocation was u = 0:7 and two frame-buffers. In <ref> [28] </ref>, Pancha and El Zarki report a similar finding for empirical MPEG-II traffic at a Leaky-Bucket input | where the token utilization is found to be approximately 0.5-0.6 for acceptably low cell-loss. 3 Proposed Architecture 3.1 Need for Stop-and-Go framing with active cell discard The conclusions from the simulations in Section <p> In comparison, the cell loss probability for a white noise process or one with short memory decreased rapidly with increased buffer size. Therefore, for long-memory traffic, if coefficient of variation was 21 large, a higher service rate was needed. This is in agreement with <ref> [28] </ref> where higher rates were necessary at a Leaky-Bucket for individual MPEG-II video streams. The ACF for these streams were significant into far lags, and the coefficient of variation of each stream (individually) was large. Increasing buffer size for long memory traffic makes guaranteeing maximum-delay and delay-jitter bounds non-trivial.

Reference-contexts: In later sections where the proposed architecture will be evaluated, we shall augment this model with three MPEG-I video traces (approximately one-half hour long each) made available in the public domain by Rose <ref> [29] </ref>. A brief overview of the F-ARIMA process follows. A background on long-memory processes appears in the Appendix. ARIMA (p; d; q) models, with d = 0; 1; 2; : : : were popularized by Box and Jenkins [2] for purposes of modeling time series data. <p> The other possibility is to explore implementing them off-line and using table look-up for call-admission. 4.1.3 Numerical results and simulation Equivalent Bandwidth calculation We applied Alternatives 1 and 2 to MPEG-I video traces made available in the public domain by Rose <ref> [29] </ref>. Table 3 shows the equivalent bandwidths needed for three of the traces (Terminator, Goldfinger, and Soccer) when all of them belong to the same jitter-class (same frame-size), and need different cell-loss probabilities.

Reference-contexts: Dropping Policy Let the negotiated mean cell-loss ratio of virtual circuit i be * i ; and the estimated cell-loss ratio at time n be ^* i [n]. Let S i [n] = * i =^* i [n]. Yang and Pan has proposed a dropping policy <ref> [31] </ref> where if an incoming cell arrives to a full buffer (in our case, full channel image), the scheduler will search the buffer for the virtual circuit (j) that has the largest S j [n] and discard one of its cells. <p> If the arriving cell belongs to virtual circuit j itself, then that cell will be dropped. The authors show that using the largest S j [n]; is optimal in bandwidth utilization among all all stationary, space conserving loss scheduling schemes (see <ref> [31] </ref>). We augment this strategy with (i) a minimum capacity C i in order to provide fairness/firewall among connections, and (ii) relaxing the constraint that the candidate for dropping be necessarily the largest S j [n]; see below. <p> cell-losses will be distributed among virtual circuits with (not guaranteed [j] &gt; 0) and (S j [n] &gt; 1): If C i cells have still not been marked, the scheduler will drop from (not guaranteed [j] &gt; 0) and (S j [n] 1) and update S j [n] similar to <ref> [31] </ref>. In all cases, the number of erased cells is decremented from not guaranteed [j], and guaranteed cells [i] is incremented by the corresponding amount. <p> Cell-drop scheduling based on maximum S j [] has been shown to be optimal in bandwidth utilization among all stationary, space-conserving loss-scheduling mechanisms by Yang and Pan <ref> [31] </ref>. In conjunction with the pseudo earliest-due-date component, it attempts to also provide a minimum number of lost deadlines.

Reference-contexts: In order to provide dependable quality of service, a multiplexing point in the network must have the capacity available when it is needed. Providing quality of service guarantees for real-time traffic is an active area of research, see for instance <ref> [7, 11, 18, 32] </ref>. However, providing guarantees on maximum-delay and delay-jitter performance in the presence of a slowly decaying auto-correlation structure in traffic is non-trivial, especially if the coefficient of variation of the marginal distribution (or the distribution tail) is large.
