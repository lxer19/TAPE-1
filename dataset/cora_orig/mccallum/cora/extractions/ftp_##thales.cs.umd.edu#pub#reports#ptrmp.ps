Title: Perturbation Theory for Rectangular Matrix Pencils  
Author: G. W. Stewart 
Date: July 1991 CS-TR 2721 Revised March 1993  
Pubnum: UMIACS-TR-91-105  
Abstract: The theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of rectangular matrix pencils is complicated by the fact that arbitrarily small perturbations of the pencil can cause them disappear. However, there are applications in which the properties of the pencil ensure the existence of eigen-values and eigenvectors. In this paper it is shown how to develop a perturbation theory for such pencils. fl Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: Then there is a unitary matrix X = q pq np np X 21 X 22 X 23 6 Rectangular Matrix Pencils such that k (X 21 X 22 )k = kX 21 k: To establish the theorem, first assume that p+q n. By the CS decomposition (e.g., see <ref> [2, p.77] </ref>) we may assume that X 1 = B B q pq 0 npq 0 C C ; where C and S are nonnegative diagonal matrices.

Reference-contexts: Since the pencil and its perturbation are square, we may use standard perturbation theory to bound the perturbation in the eigenvalue and its eigenvector (for a survey of the perturbation theory of the generalized eigenvalue problem, see <ref> [4, Ch. VI] </ref>). The dependence of the bounds on t defined by (5) is entirely natural.
