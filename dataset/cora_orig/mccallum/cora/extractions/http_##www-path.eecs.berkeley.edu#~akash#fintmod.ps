Abstract: This paper presents the requirements analysis for integrated information system models to support corporate planning and control tasks. Corporate planning is a heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed domain comprising of strategy analysis, process reengineering, and change management. Implementation of such a model will require a multi-tiered approach with a rich and flexible model-based framework at its core.

Beckhard and Harris describe typical change management models <ref> (Beckhard and Harris, 1987) </ref>. Future State/On-the-way Scenario Development.

Reference-contexts: Finally, large and small businesses alike must take account of the geographical spread of their resources, markets, suppliers, storage facilities and distribution centers. From the perspective of information systems modeling, corporate planning and control can be factored into the functional categories described by Gollu and Deshpande <ref> (Gollu and Deshpande, 1996) </ref>: Configuration Management: specifying the overall structure of the corporation including the factor acquisition, production, distribution, marketing and sales, financial and management divisions and specifying the detailed set up of the various core processes of the corporation.
