Abstract: Logical epistemology unduly sways theories of thinking that formulate problems of nonmonotonic reasoning as issues of nondeductive operations on logically phrased beliefs, because the fundamental concepts underlying such reasoning have little to do with logic or belief. These formulations make the resulting theories inappropriately special and hide the characteristic structures of nonmonotonic reasoning amid many unrelated structures. We present a more direct mathematical development of nonmonotonic reasoning free of extraneous logical and epistemological assumptions, and argue that the insights gained in this way exemplify the benefits obtained by approaching psychology as a subject for mathematical investigation through the discipline of rational psychology.

Reference-contexts: We therefore usually seek to find constitutions that express conditions as locally as possible. We will not develop a precise theory of local and global properties or their relation to mechanizability in this paper (see, for example, <ref> (Abelson, 1978) </ref> for one such theory). We do, however, make use of the related notion of compactness already familiar in logic and topology.

Reference-contexts: This paper celebrates the twentieth volume of Fundamenta Informaticae.

All rights reserved. <p> The mathematical formulation of nonmonotonic reasoning presented below resulted from this shift in focus from logic to conceptual analysis, with many of the central concepts and results of the new formulation first circulated in my monograph <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref>, a dense exposition short on explanation that revealed the mathematical structure of the subject but doubtless exceeded the tolerance of most potential readers. <p> The present exposition also draws on my later monograph (Doyle, 1988), which provided better development of the motivation, better forms for some of the concepts, and better notation. This paper omits treatment of many important topics addressed in <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> and (Doyle, 1988), in their numerous sequelae, and to some extent in (Doyle, 1980). <p> We formalize this in the notion of satisfaction system (Doyle, 1988), a clarified version of the original notion of "admissible state semantics" <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> developed to abstract traditional conceptions of deliberation and self-control. <p> The notion of basic constitution recasts the notion of admissible state semantics of (Doyle, 1983a, 1983c) in simpler terms. The treatment in <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> assigned constitutive intentional meaning to elements and judged states satisfying or not just as in the present treatment, and also provided what we now call a bounding system through an arbitrary restriction set R P (D). <p> The main difference in formulation concerned the background logic, which was not distinguished explicitly in an information system. The specific theories developed in <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> instead defined restriction sets consisting of the sets closed with respect to a compact closure operator, ignoring any notion of consistency not expressed by the satisfaction system meanings. <p> The notions of validity and invalidity employed in <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> correspond to the notions of present validity and present invalidity introduced here. <p> Our earlier treatment <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref> also explores a different means for decomposing extensions. Where stratification partitions elements according to how many steps (logical or reasoned) they take to derive, one may instead partition the underlying set D according to which state components each state component mentions, in the following sense. <p> Obviously, if S is strongly present validity optimal in R, then S is weakly present validity optimal in R. The notions of weakly present validity optimality and strongly present validity optimality correspond to the notions of validity optimality and strong validity optimality of <ref> (Doyle, 1983c) </ref>. As one might expect, since the varieties of validity optimality involve an arbitrary preference system which may bear no relation to satisfaction systems, validity optimality proves very different from satisfaction optimality. For example, satisfying sets need not be weakly present validity optimal among satisfying sets.

Reference-contexts: In general, however, the division between these two forms of nonmonotonicity is not sharp, as one may draw conclusions over time to convert logical nonmonotonicity into temporal nonmonotonicity, or replace mental simulations with atemporal reasoning or logics to convert temporal nonmonotonicity into logical nonmonotonicity (cf. <ref> (Makinson & Gardenfors, 1991) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: That monograph introduced the notion of simple reason, which resembles a RMS justification or a propositional default in the logic of defaults, but which appears as a conclusion as well as as a rule, and which so also resembles one of Minsky's "K-lines" <ref> (Minsky, 1980) </ref>. <p> Elemental framings are especially natural in artificial intelligence, which often constructs agents with mental states consisting of sets of representations (symbolic or otherwise), for example, sets of statements in a logical language, sets of data-structures, or sets of active "mental agents" in a society of mind <ref> (Minsky, 1980) </ref>. In such cases, we may choose trivial elemental framings that simply consist of the representations explicitly contained in the state; that is, in such cases, elemental framings need not simply provide ways of viewing states, but may actually provide the states themselves. 3.

We formalize this method for expressing constitutional restrictions using the notion of information systems <ref> (Scott, 1982) </ref>, which builds on Tarski's theory of closure operators to abstract the structure of logical theories.
