Abstract: We demonstrate UD's implementation of transport protocols providing partially-ordered, partially-reliable (PO/PR) service. We are developing two example client/server applications: (1) compressed wavelet-encoded image transmission, and (2) remote multimedia document retrieval. By using these examples, we show why PO/PR service is more appropriate than protocols such as TCP or UDP, particularly in lossy packet-switched battlefield network environments. In (1), we show how the system can assist in transmitting wavelet-encoded images of wounded soldiers and/or enemy locations. In (2), we retrieve a multimedia document that explains (for example) how to repair a piece of equipment damaged in the field. We create loss via a dynamically adjustable 'lossy' IP router located at UD one hop away from the server. a

Reference-contexts: This would allow such applications to achieve an appropriate balance among various QoS parameters without having to "reinvent the transport-layer wheel" with every application. Such an approach is consistent with Application Level Framing as proposed by Clark and Tennenhouse <ref> [1] </ref>. We are engaged in the task of constructing such libraries of transport layer functionality, based on the concept of partially-ordered partially-reliable (PO/PR) transport service. In this demo, we focus on two particular services: k-XP, and POCv2. <p> The (MTU) is another user-defined parameter provided to test the effects of segmentation/reassembly on image data. In the first two encoding methods, each TPDU contains enough information about how to decode the data and where to put it at the receiving end. This feature, namely Application Level Framing <ref> [1, 5] </ref>, makes these encoding methods more suitable especially for lossy networks. Once the image quality and size have been decided, the user has the option to use one of two different transport protocols: either TX or k-XP. <p> Application layer framing refers to an approach to protocol design where packet boundaries are set by the application in such a way that each packet can be individually decoded and displayed at the receiving end with no dependencies on other packets <ref> [1] </ref>. In this method, each packet is a so-called "Application Data Unit" (ADU) that can be delivered out-of-order, thus providing faster response in progressive images. In addition, each ADU can have a different QoS.

Reference-contexts: In k-XP, a "partially-reliable" message is one for which the sender specifies a maximum number of retransmissions. In POCv2, a "partially-reliable" message is one which should be retransmitted as long as it does not delay the delivery of other messages; this notion is defined more formally in <ref> [2] </ref>. The main difference between k-XP and POCv2 is the way order is handled. k-XP provides an unordered service; in this respect, it resembles UDP. Therefore, k-XP is appropriate for applications where some level of reliability is required, but where messages can be delivered in any order. <p> Given that we want to provide for graceful degradation, what transport protocol should be used for multimedia objects? We argue that classic transport services such as TCP and UDP are suboptimal for this application. We propose PO/PR service as an alternative. We are developing a prototype sys-tem <ref> [2] </ref> for authoring multimedia documents, and retrieving and displaying them across the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Recently, wavelet-based image and video coding has become quite popular; many wavelet-based encoding schemes have been developed which outperform the DCT-based algorithms in terms of both objective criteria (bit rate versus distortion) and subjective criteria <ref> [3] </ref>. One of the most important features of wavelet-based algorithms is the fact that, at low bit rates, they do not suffer from the blocking artifacts, which are the DCT-based algorithms' most notorious defect.

Reference-contexts: Then, insignificant wavelet coefficients are discarded (thresholded). The remaining coefficients are quantized and encoded to give the compressed image file. Multiresolution representation has become quite an important issue especially for layered multicast [8] and adaptive multimedia applications <ref> [4] </ref>. The fact that wavelet-based images provide multiresolution representation, and thus provide layering of information, makes them an excellent choice for today's heterogeneous networks as well as low-bandwidth networks that lose and reorder packets. Our application consists of two components: An image sender and an image receiver.

Reference-contexts: This feature makes wavelet-based algorithms a better choice for low bit rate image and video coding applications. The basic procedure in a wavelet-based image compression scheme is as follows: First, the image is decomposed into wavelet coefficients in different resolution layers to form a multiresolution representation of the image <ref> [6] </ref>. Then, insignificant wavelet coefficients are discarded (thresholded). The remaining coefficients are quantized and encoded to give the compressed image file. Multiresolution representation has become quite an important issue especially for layered multicast [8] and adaptive multimedia applications [4].

Reference-contexts: If UDP is used to transmit vital information, important data may be lost or misordered unless the application incorporates the complexity of handling these cases. (Reference <ref> [7] </ref> provides a mathematical analysis of the performance penalty when a transport service does not support the ideal reliability level for an application.) However, correctly designing and implementing an application specific transport protocol that correctly handles retransmission and flow-control may be a larger effort than designing and implementing the application that

Reference-contexts: These documents consist of objects such as still images, text, audio clips and video clips, which are pre-arranged according to some temporal scenario. Various schemes exist for expressing these temporal scenarios <ref> [9] </ref>. During playback of such a document, object presentation proceeds according to this temporal scenario until some event occurs which stops or resets it-for example, a user interaction point is reached, or a user presses a "pause" button.
