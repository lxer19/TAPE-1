Reference-contexts: Solving Equations (7)-(9) requires the same work as the inner loop calculations of the algorithm introduced by Heirich and Taylor <ref> [1] </ref>. Equations (7)-(9) can be solved analytically in terms of the eigenfunctions, x j;k;p = cos (jl=(L 1)) cos (km=(M 1)) cos (pn=(N 1)), of the discrete Laplacian, where the 4 number of processors on the grid is LM N .
