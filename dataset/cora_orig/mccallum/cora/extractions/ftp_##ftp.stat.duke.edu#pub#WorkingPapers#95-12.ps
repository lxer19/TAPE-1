Abstract: Some areas of recent development and current interest in time series are noted, with some discussion of Bayesian modelling efforts motivated by substantial practical problems. The areas include non-linear auto-regressive time series modelling, measurement error structures in state-space modelling of time series, and issues of timing uncertainties and time deformations. Some discussion of the needs and opportunities for work on non/semi-parametric models and robustness issues is given in each context.
