Title: Reconstructing a Three-Dimensional Model with Arbitrary Errors  
Author: Bonnie Berger Jon Kleinberg Tom Leighton 
Abstract: A number of current technologies allow for the determination of inter-atomic distance information in structures such as proteins and RNA. Thus, the reconstruction of a three-dimensional set of points using information about its inter-point distances has become a task of basic importance in determining molecular structure. The distance measurements one obtains from techniques such as NMR are typically sparse and error-prone, greatly complicating the reconstruction task. Many of these errors result in distance measurements that can be safely assumed to lie within certain fixed tolerances. But a number of sources of systematic error in these experiments lead to inaccuracies in the data that are very hard to quantify; in effect, one must treat certain entries of the measured distance matrix as being arbitrarily "corrupted." The existence of arbitrary errors leads to an interesting sort of error-correction problem | how many corrupted entries in a distance matrix can be efficiently corrected to produce a consistent three-dimensional structure? For the case of an n fi n matrix in which every entry is specified, we provide a randomized algorithm running in time O(n log n) that enumerates all structures consistent with at most ( 1 2 ")n errors per row, with high probability. In the case of randomly located errors, we can correct errors of the same density in a sparse matrix | one in which only a fi fraction of the entries in each row are given, for any constant fi &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.5 If d ffn 4=5 for some sufficiently large constant ff, then G can be partitioned into O (n=d) subgraphs, each of size (d) and each having O (1) consistent conformations. Proof. We make use of a theorem of Bolker and Roth <ref> [1] </ref> stating that, subject to our non-degeneracy assumptions (1) and (2), the graph K 4;6 is rigid in R 3 for any set of distances on its edges. (See also [18].) By standard results of Milnor [13] and Thom [16], this implies that a given distance-labeled K 4;6 has O (1) <p> As before, this graph will be infinitesimally rigid and hence have at most O (1) conformations <ref> [1, 13, 16] </ref>. One of these conformations will agree with P .

Reference-contexts: A well-known result in extremal graph theory (see Bollobas <ref> [2, ch. 6] </ref>) states that if the number of edges of a graph exceeds s 1=t n 21=t + tn, then the graph contains a copy of K s;t , for any s and t. <p> These conformations are produced as follows. Let H c denote the graph of correct distances in M c . Since d c 1 2 c + 4, we know by the result from <ref> [2] </ref> (see the proof of Theorem 2.5 above), that H c contains a copy of K 4;6 (provided that c is a sufficiently large constant). As before, this graph will be infinitesimally rigid and hence have at most O (1) conformations [1, 13, 16].

Reference-contexts: Problems arising from (i) alone | exact but sparse distance information | forms the core of rigidity theory, a subject dating back to mathematicians and mechanical engineers of the nineteenth century (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). Problems arising from (i) and (ii) together are currently handled in practice by algorithms based on distance geometry (see e.g. [6, 7]), which has proved to be effective at refining an initial set of distance measurements by a variety of constraint propagation and "bounds smoothing" techniques.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is natural to ask what can be said about the range n 4 . Here, a result of Connelly (unpublished, <ref> [5] </ref>) implies that the graph K 6;6 is generically globally rigid in R 3 ; that is, any non-degenerate labeling of distances on its edges results in a unique consistent conformation.

Thus, we feel that an interesting direction for future work would be to investigate effective ways of combining the approach here with the techniques of distance geometry.
