For cache simulation, where cache-line granularity is needed, instruction breakpoints, data breakpoints, or memory parity traps can be set [2]. Two essential features of this approach enable Tapeworm to overcome the limitations of trace-driven simulation. <p> We are using Tapeworm to study architectural support for next-generation operating system technology like Mach 3.0, in work follows our previous studies in this area <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. Additionally, we are working on ways to improve the kernel-based simulation method itself. To increase Tapeworms speed, we are exploring set-sampling techniques and investigating architectural support to lower the cost of handling misses.

Two essential features of this approach enable Tapeworm to overcome the limitations of trace-driven simulation. First, because Tapeworm processes only the infrequent case of misses, it is much faster than comparable trace-driven simulators, which consider all memory references.
