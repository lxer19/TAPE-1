Abstract: As the field of view of a picture is much smaller than our own visual field of view, it is common to paste together several pictures to create a panoramic mosaic having a larger field of view. Images with a wider field of view can be generated by using fish-eye lens, or panoramic mosaics can be created by special devices which rotate around the camera's optical center (Quicktime VR, Surround Video), or by aligning, and pasting, frames in a video sequence to a single reference frame. Existing mosaicing methods have strong limitations on imaging conditions, and distortions are common.

Reference-contexts: There are two reasons for that selection: * Alignment is usually better at the center than at the edges of the pictures. * Image distortion is minimal at the center of the im ages This selection corresponds to the Voronoi tessellation <ref> [1] </ref>, and is shown in Figure 4. Using the Voronoi tessellation for image cut-and-paste also served to minimize visible misalignment due to lens distortions. Voronoi tessellation causes every seam to be at the same distance from the two corresponding image centers.

Reference-contexts: In order to increase accuracy, additional alignment is done off-line, this time computing both 2D image translation and 2D image rotation. This is done in a multi-resolution fashion by solving 3 equations with 3 unknowns (the motion parameters for image trans lation and rotation), as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Cut and Paste Combination of the sequence of aligned image frames into a single panoramic mosaic can be done in several ways.

Reference-contexts: A more common solution is photo-mosaicing: aligning, and pasting, frames in a video sequence, which enables a more complete view. Digital photography created new applications for mosaicing <ref> [14, 15, 16, 3] </ref>, which were first implemented for aerial and satellite images. Three major issues are important in image mosaicing: * Image alignment: Determines the transformation that aligns the images to be combined into a mosaic. Paper photo-mosaicing uses rigid transformations for alignment: picture translations and rotations. <p> These seams should be eliminated in order to get a seamless panorama. The process of blending the different images into a seamless panorama must smooth all these illumination disconti-nuities, while preserving image sharpness. A method that fulfills this requirement is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this approach, the images are decomposed into band-pass pyramid levels, and then combined at each band-pass pyramid level . Final reconstruction of the images from the combined band-pass levels give the desired panorama. 6 Examples all done in full color.

Reference-contexts: Since it is not simple to ensure a pure rotation around the optical center, such mosaics are used only in limited cases. In more general camera motions, that may include both camera translations and camera rotations, more general transformation for image alignment are used <ref> [4, 6, 10, 18, 8] </ref>. In all cases images are aligned pairwise, using a parametric transformation like an affine transformation or planar-projective transformation. A reference frame is selected, and all images are aligned with this reference frame and combined to create the panoramic mosaic.

Reference-contexts: Such translations can either be computed by manually pointing to corresponding points, or by image correlation methods. Other simple mosaics are created by rotating the camera around its optical center using a special device, and creating a panoramic image which represents the projection of the scene onto a cylinder <ref> [5, 13, 12, 11] </ref>. Since it is not simple to ensure a pure rotation around the optical center, such mosaics are used only in limited cases.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 is an example of such a 1D scan system. In some cases mosaics generated in this manner can be considered at linear pushbroom cameras <ref> [7] </ref>. In more general cases the motion of the sweeping plane may not be known. It seems impossible to align the 1-D image strips coming from an arbitrary plane sweep, but the system (pushbroom camera). problem becomes easier when the input is a video sequence.

Reference-contexts: projection is very different from a perspective projection in the sense that far-away objects do not appear smaller than close-by objects. 3 Image Alignment Simulation of scene sweeping by a plane from a given video sequence can be done once the full 3D motion of the camera (ego-motion) is known <ref> [9] </ref>. Given the 3D ego-motion, and given the range of objects whose aspect ratio should be best, it can be determined for each image where is the 1-D strip to be aligned and pasted into the mosaic as depicted in Figure 1.
