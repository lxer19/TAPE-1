Reference-contexts: Throughout the rest of this thesis, we shall use the term device-environment system to refer to the device, the user, and any objects or materials used by the device 1 . 3.1 Some example instructions and their analyses In this section, we present several examples of instructions (taken from <ref> (Black & Decker, 1994) </ref>), and analyse them to determine what types of knowledge are necessary to understand the situations described by the sentences. Warning instructions have been chosen for these examples, because they serve well to illustrate the kinds of knowledge required for instructions in general.

Reference-contexts: non-sectioned manuals may present the above information in an interleaved fashion, especially if space is a problem and the writers do not wish to divide the manual into such sections. 5 An instruction conveyed by an explanation stance may be realized as a matrix clause together with a purpose clause <ref> (Di Eugenio, 1992) </ref>. The matrix clause describes the action, and the purpose clause expresses an agent's purpose in performing that action. 7 2.3.2 Vander Linden Vander Linden (1993) addressed the problem of determining the precise rhetorical and grammatical forms that are most effective for expressing actions in an instructional context. <p> Sometimes we would like the system to infer the fillers of other roles for a particular action. For example, sometimes we will want the system to generate an explanation instruction (see section 2.3.1), in other words, an instruction containing both a matrix and a purpose clause <ref> (Di Eugenio, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It provides a broad coverage of English syntax, probably the most comprehensive of any readily available text generator. Penman is based on a systemic-functional view of language <ref> (Halliday, 1976) </ref>: its approach is functional, that is, it uses features of the context to map communicative goals to acceptable grammatical forms. A by-product of this view of language is that the system contains a well-developed implementation of the systemic network.

Reference-contexts: These rules are applied as in a production system, i.e., a recursive descent traversal of the message is made. The final stage is to produce a linear sequence of words. An example of an expression in the message language (before simplification) corresponding to this piece of text follows (from <ref> (Mellish and Evans, 1989, page 237) </ref>): If you go to the front of the car now you will not be at the cab afterwards. However in order to start the engine you must be at it. Therefore before going to the front of the car you must start the engine. <p> This combination implies you should start the engine before you go to the front of the car" <ref> (Mellish and Evans, 1989, page 237) </ref>. The intent of Mellish and Evans was to produce a model of a complete system as a basis for comparison with future work.

Reference-contexts: Their paper <ref> (Paris and Scott, 1994) </ref> is one step in this direction. In this study, Paris and Scott described different ways, or stances, in which instruction manuals can convey information: Information provision Factual knowledge is provided which augments the reader's knowledge of the artifact or the task.

Reference-contexts: We will endeavour to show how knowledge about a device that already exists as part of the engineering effort , together with adequate, domain-independent knowledge about the environment, can be used for generating natural language instructions. We will also describe how all 1 TECHDOC <ref> (Rosner and Stede, 1994) </ref> is one example of a multi-lingual technical documentation generation system. 1 this knowledge can be used for generating warning instructions, i.e., cautions to the user directing them to avoid certain situations.

Reference-contexts: Their system used, as input, the data structures produced by the NONLIN hierarchical planner <ref> (Tate, 1976) </ref>. The process of natural language generation from here can be thought of as consisting of four stages, centring on the construction and manipulation of an expression of their message language.

Reference-contexts: A PRL specification represents the actions and their attributes, which have the following slots (from <ref> (Vander Linden, 1993, pages 60-61) </ref>): Action-Type The lexical item corresponding to this action. Actor The PRL entity which represents the actor. Actee The PRL entity which represents the object acted upon by the actor. Destination The PRL entity which represents the destination of a moving action. <p> Duration-Units The lexical item corresponding to the units of the duration. Instrument The PRL entity which represents the instrument used in the action. In addition, the PRL entities, which represent the objects referred to by the actions, have attributes associated with them (see <ref> (Vander Linden, 1993, page 61) </ref> for a listing of these). Thus, a planner which produces PRL structures should be able to deal with temporal information at some level, and should be hierarchical, in order to take full advantage of IMAGENE's expressive power. <p> Nevertheless, determining the conditions under which a 36 purpose clause should be generated is beyond the scope of this work (but see <ref> (Vander Linden, 1993) </ref>), so we shall not consider this issue further. <p> Vander Linden acknowledges that as well as the planner needing to determine the content of the instructional text, it would "also be critical in implementing the text-level inquiries, a step that is required for fully automating the instruction 49 generation process" <ref> (Vander Linden, 1993, page 133) </ref>. Thus the planner, or a system working in tandem with the planner 2 , should be able to identify these features (the values of which are input to IMAGENE via its inquiries).
