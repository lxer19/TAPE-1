Title: THE ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF A GRAPH CAPTURES ITS COMMUTE AND COVER TIMES  
Author: Ashok K. Chandra, Prabhakar Raghavan, Walter L. Ruzzo, Roman Smolensky, and Prasoon Tiwari 
Abstract: View an n-vertex, m-edge undirected graph as an electrical network with unit resistors as edges. We extend known relations between random walks and electrical networks by showing that resistance in this network is intimately connected with the lengths of random walks on the graph. For example, the commute time between two vertices s and t (the expected length of a random walk from s to t and back) is precisely characterized by the effective resistance R st between s and t: commute time = 2mR st . As a corollary, the cover time (the expected length of a random walk visiting all vertices) is characterized by the maximum resistance R in the graph to within a factor of log n: mR cover time O(mR log n). For many graphs, the bounds on cover time obtained in this manner are better than those obtained from previous techniques such as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In particular, we improve known bounds on cover times for high-degree graphs and expanders, and give new proofs of known results for multidimensional meshes. Moreover, resistance seems to provide an intuitively appealing and tractable approach to these problems. Key words. Random walk, resistance, cover time, commute time.

Reference-contexts: The study of random walks in graphs has many applications in the design of algorithms | in the study of distributed computation ( Broder & Karlin 1989 ) , space-bounded computation <ref> (Aleliunas et al. 1979, Borodin et al. 1989) </ref>, time-space tradeoffs (Barnes & Feige 1996, Broder et al. 2 Chandra, et al. 1994, Feige 1993), and in the design of approximation algorithms for some hard combinatorial problems (Dyer et al. 1991, Jerrum & Sinclair 1989). <p> This equality (like the equalities of Doyle and Snell) reiterates the fact that the electrical properties of the network underlying a graph are innately tied to the random walk. Prior work in the study of the cover time of graphs has used techniques from Markov chain theory <ref> (Aleliunas et al. 1979, Gobel & Jagers 1974) </ref>, from combinatorics ( Kahn et al. 1989 ) , from linear algebra ( Broder & Karlin 1989 ) and from graph theory ( Jerrum & Sinclair 1989 ) .

Reference-contexts: For example, note that 4m=d min &lt; n 2 whenever d min 2 or d max &lt; n=2. Finally, Theorem 4.2 also implies that the resistance between any pair of vertices in any family of bounded degree expander graphs <ref> (see the next section, or Alon 1986) </ref> is bounded by O (1). In the rest of this paper we study resistance in two graph families: (i) families of expanders whose maximum degree may be a function of n; and (ii) multidimensional meshes.

Reference-contexts: Applying Theorem 2.6 we see that the length of universal traversal sequences for d-regular graphs, for any d bn=2c, is O (n 3 log n).

Reference-contexts: side can be re-written as k X C f k X R v i ;v i+1 = F R D : Resistance and Commute Times 9 Because the Markov chain corresponding to our walk is reversible, the probability of walking any cycle is equal to the probability of its reversal <ref> (Doyle & Snell 1984, Exercise 3.1.3) </ref>, and so the expected lengths of random walks traversing D and D 0 are equal. <p> We give a direct proof, although the results below largely follow from Theorems 2.1 and 2.4 and known results on hitting and cover times for meshes (c.f. Aldous 1983, 1993, Cox 1989, and Gobel & Jagers 1974, for example). Our proof technique, which is similar to <ref> (Doyle & Snell 1984, Section 8.7) </ref>, is of interest, and, unlike the more "classical" analysis of hitting time for meshes, can likely be extended to less symmetrical graphs which remain "mesh-like." It is easy to see that a (k; 1) mesh has resistance n=4 O (1=n).
