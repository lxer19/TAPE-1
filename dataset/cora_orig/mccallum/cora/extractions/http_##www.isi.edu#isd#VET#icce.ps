Abstract: Advances in visualization and networking technologies make it possible to construct virtual learning environments, i.e., virtual worlds in which learners can immerse themselves. This paper examines issues involved in the design of computer-generated virtual agents with which learners may interact in such environments. Functions common to intelligent tutoring systems, such as student modeling and coaching, are assigned to individual agents, rather than being disembodied functions of the tutoring system as a whole. This stance offers new perspectives on long-standing problems in intelligent tutoring system design, such as how to structure tutorial interactions. It also reveals issues that tend to be ignored in conventional systems, such as interpersonal relations between learners and tutoring systems. The paper describes progress achieved to date in creating pedagogical agents for virtual learning environments, and discusses planned future work in this area.

Reference-contexts: In a similar manner, students in virtual environments are expected to reach impasses, and require assistance. The plan recognition technique used in REACT, and being applied in VET, is called situated plan attribution (SPA). SPA is a variant of the model tracing approach to student modeling <ref> [1] </ref>, designed to reduce the computational cost of tracking and understanding student actions. During ordinary student activity, student behavior is matched against a library of procedural plans.

Reference-contexts: Reeves and his colleagues have argued that people interact with computers at a personal and emotional level [14], and that cooperation between computer and human is facilitated if the computer exhibits a personality that is compatible with that of the human teammate <ref> [6] </ref>. These factors are bound to be even more important with agents that assume concrete form within the environment. This may prove to be a way of getting a deeper understanding of the problem of designing effective pedagogical strategies. After all, pedagogical interactions are simply another type of interpersonal interaction.

Reference-contexts: Another important problem is how to assign personalities to agents that are consistent with their role in the modeled activity. Reeves and his colleagues have argued that people interact with computers at a personal and emotional level <ref> [14] </ref>, and that cooperation between computer and human is facilitated if the computer exhibits a personality that is compatible with that of the human teammate [6]. These factors are bound to be even more important with agents that assume concrete form within the environment.
