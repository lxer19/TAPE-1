Abstract: Traditionally, Markov Random Field (MRF) models have been used in low level image analysis. This correspondence presents an MRF based scheme to perform object delineation. The proposed edge-based approach involves extracting straight lines from the edge map of an image. Then an MRF model is used to group these lines to delineate buildings in aerial images.

Reference-contexts: A discussion of MRFs and the proof of equivalence between MRFs and Gibbs distributions can be found in [3], <ref> [1] </ref>. Maximizing the above probability results in the maximum likelihood estimate of the buildings in the image. But the quantities b 1 ; ; b k do not directly appear in the energy function.

Reference-contexts: In all the aforementioned applications MRF models are used on the pixels of the image. The efficacy of these models has been demonstrated in low level processing, but their applicability to high level problems such as object recognition is yet to be fully explored. In <ref> [2] </ref>, [10] MRF models have been used for some high level vision problems. In this correspondence,, we explore the applicability of MRFs to object delineation.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen the problem of delineating buildings in aerial images, which in its own right is an important problem, because buildings are the perceptually dominant structures in aerial images; hence building detection has been an important task in aerial image understanding. Region and edge based methods presented in <ref> [5] </ref>, [9], [6], [4] and [11] use a large set of rules and are computationally very expensive.

Reference-contexts: This is often due to poor contrast. Thus the grouping may result in some partial boundary shapes of the buildings. We use deformable contours (snakes) <ref> [7] </ref> for partial shape completion. Deformable contours are active contours of deformable shape, the final shape being determined by minimization of an energy function. In any approach using deformable contours, the initialization is important, which is two-folds, the initial shape and its spatial position.

Reference-contexts: Also during each iteration the gradient needs to be computed, again, here all computations are local. (4) Even though the energy function has four free parameters, in <ref> [8] </ref> we have shown interdependencies between these parameters, hence it is not necessary to choose all these parameters independently. 4 Delineating Buildings In delineating buildings one aspect that has to be taken into consideration is the presence of shadows.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is as follows: (1) Straight lines are extracted from images by using an edge detector followed by a line extractor <ref> [12] </ref>. (2) An MRF model is used on these extracted lines with a suitable neighborhood.
