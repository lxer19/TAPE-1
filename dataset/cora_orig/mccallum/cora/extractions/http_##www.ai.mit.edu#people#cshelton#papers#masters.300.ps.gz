Reference-contexts: While much attention has been paid to correspondences between images and some attention has been given to three-dimensional volumetric correspondences (e.g. between MRI scans, see [4] and [6]), there has been little work on surface correspondences. 1 see <ref> [1] </ref> for a good overview of optical flow algorithms 7 uncertain whether the circle rotated about its center as it was translating. <p> new similar objects (e.g. the correspondence between two four legged animals should help us produce a novel four legged animal), we will judge a correspondence by how well the object ~ ffiD (A) fits into the class of objects to which both A and B belong for all ffi on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> What are the properties of this operator? For two subspaces of dimension d of a space of dimension n, the range of the operator is <ref> [1 min (d; n d); 1] </ref> which means that for hyperplanes with one fewer dimensions than their embedded space or for one dimensional lines the operator measures the square of the cosine of the angle between either the normals or the tangents respectively.

Reference-contexts: Our technique differs from other methods in its easy extension to higher dimensions, handling of colored surfaces, and multi-resolution approach. The pyramid structure of the algorithm was originally inspired by Gaussian pyramid schemes used in optical flow such as the hierarchical method in <ref> [2] </ref>. Yet, this is the first time that a data-dependent method of reduction has been used for hierarchical correspondence generation.

Reference-contexts: The frames in between represent ~ ffiD (A). The outlines of the triangles (as shown in previous morph sequences) have been removed here for clarity. 39 Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 Related Work Blanz and Vetter have also done work on surface correspondences <ref> [3] </ref>. In their work, the surface is first projected onto a surrounding shape which is then unrolled and optical flow techniques are used to find correspondence across these unrolled sheets.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis, we will explore a new area of correspondence. In particular, we will focus on correspondence between two-dimensional manifolds in three-dimensional space. While much attention has been paid to correspondences between images and some attention has been given to three-dimensional volumetric correspondences (e.g. between MRI scans, see <ref> [4] </ref> and [6]), there has been little work on surface correspondences. 1 see [1] for a good overview of optical flow algorithms 7 uncertain whether the circle rotated about its center as it was translating.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this also means that only a limited class of objects can be represented (namely it places limits on the curvature of the surfaces). The energy minimization portion of the algorithm was inspired by the formulation of elastic nets <ref> [5] </ref>. It is also similar to snakes [10]. [11] provides an overview of such deformable models and their uses in matching. Our technique differs from other methods in its easy extension to higher dimensions, handling of colored surfaces, and multi-resolution approach.

Reference-contexts: Polygon reduction algorithms essentially solve the exact problem we have. The idea is to create a new mesh with fewer triangles and vertices that looks as close as possible to the original mesh. For our work, we chose to use the mesh simplification algorithm of Hoppe called Progressive Meshes <ref> [7] </ref>. Hoppe's algorithm has a number of nice properties but most importantly for this work is the fact that it tries to preserve the surface shape and not just geometry: it pays attention to the discontinuity curves of the surface and attempts to keep their topology constant throughout the reduction. <p> We will not detail the progressive mesh algorithm here but rather just refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. It is important to note that polygon reduction algorithms in general (and Hoppe's progressive meshes in particular) can give as output meshes which contain no vertices in the same positions as those of the original object.

Reference-contexts: For our purposes, we may think of X K as an ordered set of triangles each described by referencing three vertexes from X V . <ref> [8] </ref> has a nice technical description of this mesh representation, but for this thesis, we will not need to use that mathematical machinery. A correspondence algorithm on such meshes will take as input two objects A and B and produce as output a displacement set D of vectors.

Reference-contexts: Of course this isn't limited to models of four-legged animals; the same technique would work with three-dimensional models of cars, faces, or coffee mugs. Similar work has already been done for the domain of images in the case of faces, handwritten digits, and cars <ref> [9] </ref>. This parameterized model can be used for a number of interesting applications. New examples of objects in the class can be described in terms of these parameters and easily compared for similarity.

Reference-contexts: For graphics applications, this allows interesting animation sequences generated automatically or semi-automatically. Furthermore, by setting a group of shapes from a single class of objects in correspondence with a base shape from the class, we can generate a linear model of that class of objects [13] <ref> [12] </ref>. Each correspondence between the base shape and another shape represents one flow field. These flow fields can be linearly combined to produce new flow fields which represent novel objects whose shapes are still part of the same class of objects.
