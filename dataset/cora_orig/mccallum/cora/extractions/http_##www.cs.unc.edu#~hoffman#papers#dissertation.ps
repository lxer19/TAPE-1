The construction of a score table for a particular dihedral descriptor starts with a two-dimensional 24-by-24 array with the entries on the main diagonal being 100 and all off diagonal entries being 0.

Reference-contexts: measuring similarities between biological sequences have evolved over the last three decades, starting with the work of Devereux et al. on the wordsearch program for the gcg package (Dev-ereux et al., 1984), fastp (Lipman and Pearson, 1985), fasta (Pearson and Lipman, 1988), and including more recent algorithms, such as blast <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. These algorithms have come to be accepted and well understood as an extensive body of research has been developed over the years. One of the earliest exhaustive sequence comparison methods is by Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). <p> One of the earliest exhaustive sequence comparison methods is by Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). Subsequently, many algorithmic refinements have been offered, most notably by Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981) and Altschul et al <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. For computational purposes a DNA or RNA molecule is represented as a long string of characters drawn from a four-character alphabet. Similarly, protein molecules are represented as strings of characters from a twenty-character alphabet. <p> This algorithm generates non-gapped alignments, very similar to BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref> but with greater sensitivity to long, low scoring alignments (Karlin and Altschul, 1993). A more detailed rationale for this choice is give in Section 4.4.1.

Reference-contexts: By the mid nineteenth century attempts had been made to work out the basic chemical formula of such substances; the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder worked out a basic formula and named it "protein", from the Greek word for "of first importance" <ref> (Asimov, 1960, page 68) </ref>. Mulder's formula was much simpler than those of actual proteins because methods for determining the chemical composition of such large molecules did not exist at the time. Never the less, the name "protein" came into common use for this entire class of substances. <p> He named these amino acid chains "peptides" from the Greek word for "digestion" and the link between the carboxyl carbon and the amine group a "peptide bond" <ref> (Asimov, 1960, page 72) </ref>. Today we know that proteins are polypeptide chains that are long enough to fold up into a characteristic shape. This characteristic shape helps to determine the chemical and biological functions of the protein.

Reference-contexts: How accurate are the atomic coordinates in a PDB file? A good X-ray derived protein structure, like 4fxn (Smith et al., 1977), have a stated resolution of 1.8 A for the entire structure. This translates to uncertainty of 0:1 A for individual atoms <ref> (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980) </ref>. Using this value as an initial error estimate it is possible to compute the propagated error in a typical dihedral angle computation. Calculating the propagated error using an initial coordinate uncertainty of 0:1 A yields dihedral angle errors of greater than 10 ffi .

Reference-contexts: With this new application of sequence alignment techniques there is little doubt that the sensitivity of the score tables can be improved. It is possible that a block substitution method, similar to the approach used in generating the BLOSUM scoring tables for amino acid sequence alignments <ref> (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) </ref>, can generate score tables with sensitivities aimed at particular local folds or protein families. As things now stand, the software tools developed during the course of my research are effective but certainly not usable by a non-computer scientist.

Reference-contexts: The BioSCAN system is a network-accessible, computational resource (Singh et al., 1996) that performs rapid exhaustive searches of DNA, RNA, and protein sequence databases. Originally intended for sequence comparison, I have adapted the BioSCAN computer to perform 3D protein structure comparison using 1D dihedral sequences <ref> (Hoffman et al., 1995) </ref>. BioSCAN is comprised of hardware-based pre-filtering and software-based post-processing stages. The custom VLSIC implements the algorithm given in Equation 4.13. It identifies significant alignments which contain one or more high-scoring segment pairs.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, comparison of a folded protein with a database of 720 folded proteins by the method of Orengo et al on a Sun-4/280 workstation required 1.7 CPU hours (Orengo et al., 1992). A comparison of the speed of the BioSCAN algorithm on various architectures has been described <ref> (Hoffman, 1993a) </ref>. This ability to compare a new protein structure against the entire PDB database of folded proteins in a matter of seconds encourages the everyday interactive use of such database searches. The sensitivity of dihedral sequence comparison is determined by the score table used.

Reference-contexts: 3, where expected structural similarity is not found, and type 6, where unexpected structural similarity is found. 8.1 Comparison of protein structure The sensitivity of the score tables developed in Chapter 7 were tested by verifying that this method can correctly register the structural dissimilarity between proteins in Jones' list <ref> (Jones et al., 1992) </ref>. This list contains proteins which do not have an apparent structural similarity. Our pairwise comparisons of all proteins in this list showed that each of these unique proteins aligned strongly only with itself.

Reference-contexts: Several competing methods actually perform nested dynamic programing with a complexity of O (m 2 n 2 ) . Other algorithms that directly compute RMSD in their inner loop usually rely on the quaternion method <ref> (Kearkey, 1990) </ref>, since it provides a closed form solution for the superposition. Though the complecity of the quaternion method is O (n) its constant factors are large, involving a great deal of floating-point calculation.

Reference-contexts: Using the more restrictive relative positional error of 0:01 A gives a value of 1:27 ffi . 5.3 Propagated error using interval arithmetic A more precise method of computing the propagated error in dihedral angle com putation is to use interval arithmetic <ref> (Moore, 1975) </ref>. Interval arithmetic is a simple technique for keeping track of the effects of starting a computation with approximate initial data. Because the error bounds are calculated at each step of the computation and propagated through all subsequent steps, the resulting error bounds are exact.

Reference-contexts: An effective description of the 3D geometry of a protein can be achieved by considering simpler structural descriptors than atomic spatial coordinates (Levitt and Warshel, 1975; Warshel and Levitt, 1976; Laiter et al., 1995). Oldfield and Hubbard <ref> (Oldfield and Hubbard, 1994) </ref> have shown that protein structural analysis can be performed using only the C ff atoms of the polypeptide backbone. For each ordered set of four successive C ff atoms in the polypeptide backbone, they defined the dihedral angle t (Fig. 3.1). <p> Other dihedral angles may be defined by using different spacing. One commonly used angle is defined by four successive C ff atoms (Fig. 3.1). Designated the t angle by Oldfield and Hubbard <ref> (Oldfield and Hubbard, 1994) </ref> it has been used, in combination with other angles, as a descriptor of protein structure. It can be thought of as the angle defined by atoms j; j +3; j +6; and j +9 with atom j always being a C ff .

Reference-contexts: The time required ranges from a few hours to tens of hours for comparing a single structure against any significant portion of the PDB. Shown in Table 2.1 is a summary of recently developed and currently used structure comparison methods drawn from a survey by Orengo <ref> (Orengo, 1994) </ref>. Most of these methods have been derived from earlier works and represent many years of algorithm and program development effort.

Reference-contexts: We also evaluated the ability of this method in determining structural similarity relationships between protein structures in the collection of 167 representative similar protein structures given by Orengo et al. <ref> (Orengo et al., 1992) </ref>. This paper clusters proteins into fold families and ranks the proteins within each family based on a complex 3D structural similarity score. <p> It finds structurally similar local protein folds that agree with results of a much more computationally intensive, multi-parameter method of 3D comparison <ref> (Orengo et al., 1992) </ref>. The speed of dihedral sequence comparison when implemented on the BioSCAN system is one of its most attractive features. Comparison of a folded protein with a database of 3754 folded proteins requires on the average just 12 seconds. <p> Comparison of a folded protein with a database of 3754 folded proteins requires on the average just 12 seconds. In contrast, comparison of a folded protein with a database of 720 folded proteins by the method of Orengo et al on a Sun-4/280 workstation required 1.7 CPU hours <ref> (Orengo et al., 1992) </ref>. A comparison of the speed of the BioSCAN algorithm on various architectures has been described (Hoffman, 1993a).

Reference-contexts: The sensitivity of dihedral sequence comparison is determined by the score table used. By adjusting the mismatch score used in the score table, tolerance for intervening sequences of dissimilar structure can be increased or decreased to fit the problem. Searches for small, highly conserved structures, such as "foldons" <ref> (Panchenko et al., 1996) </ref>, are best accomplished using a 40 or 50 mismatch score. When searching for less exact folding motifs, a more lenient mismatch score of 30 or 20 is indicated.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms for detecting and measuring similarities between biological sequences have evolved over the last three decades, starting with the work of Devereux et al. on the wordsearch program for the gcg package (Dev-ereux et al., 1984), fastp (Lipman and Pearson, 1985), fasta <ref> (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) </ref>, and including more recent algorithms, such as blast (Altschul et al., 1990). These algorithms have come to be accepted and well understood as an extensive body of research has been developed over the years.

Reference-contexts: A more exciting prospect is investigating the use of long-span dihedral descriptors for use in identifying non-local structural similarities. Descriptors with spans of twenty, fifty, or one hundred residues may be able to identify large repetitive motifs, such as those found in ff=fi barrels, Greek keys, and jelly rolls <ref> (Richardson and Richardson, 1989) </ref>. This application would require generation of new score tables and score evaluation methods. After two decades of research, new methods of table generation for nucleic acid and amino acid sequence alignment continue to emerge.
