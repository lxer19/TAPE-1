Abstract: Visual information is increasingly important yet methods for its access by blind persons are inadequate. This paper describes and evaluates TACTICS, a system for the automatic visual to tactile translation of digitized images. The results of experiments testing perception of TACTICS-generated tactile images are provided. Investigation in the area of tactual perception [?] identifies important factors that can guide the translation of visual information into a meaningful tactile form [?]. These factors include the disparity of resolution between the eye and fingertip, optimal size for a tactile graphic, and how the This paper describes a unique system for the automatic translation of visual images into tactile graphics, or tactics. The TACTile Image Creation System (TACTICS) combines lessons learned from the areas of human perception and tactile graphic production with image processing techniques. The results of four experiments designed to test this system are reported and discussed. Can visual images be automatically translated into tactile images such that a blind person can make meaningful use of the result? mind classifies and uses visual information.
