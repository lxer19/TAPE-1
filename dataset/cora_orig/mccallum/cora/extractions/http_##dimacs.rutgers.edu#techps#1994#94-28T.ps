Reference-contexts: This kind of computation appears for instance in Quantum Field Theory ([Be], [GG]), F being in this case a perturbation series, or in electric networks computations <ref> [BB] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The following result may be seen as a natural analog of the factorization formulas for Schur polynomials in two finite sets of commutative variables given in <ref> [BeRe] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that most of the Lie idempotents which have been encountered up to now are elements of the descent algebra (cf. <ref> [BBG] </ref> or [Re]). In this section, we show that these elements appear quite naturally in the theory of noncommutative symmetric functions. In the commutative case, the products of power sums I are idempotent (up to a scalar factor) for the internal product. <p> To show that 1 n n () is indeed an idempotent, we must prove that n () fl n = n n . As observed in <ref> [BBG] </ref>, it is possible to get a little more. Proposition 5.12 For every n 1, one has K n (q) fl n = (q) n1 n . Proof | Let k N (q) = (q N1 ) (q N2 ) (1).

Reference-contexts: For n 2, there is an explicit bijection between L n () and the homogeneous component L n (a; b) of degree n of the free Lie algebra L (a; b) on a two letters alphabet. This bijection follows from Lazard's elimination theorem (see <ref> [Bo] </ref>) which says in particular that the K-module L (a; b) is the direct sum of two free Lie algebras L (a; b) = K a L (f (ad a) n b ; n 0g) : The desired bijection is obtained by considering the Lie morphism from L () into L

Reference-contexts: As already mentioned, formula (70) permits the recursive computation of the n in terms of iterated integrals. There exists, however, an explicit expression of this type, which is due to Bialynicki-Birula, Mielnik and Peblanski <ref> [BMP] </ref> (see also [MP]). We shall here only state a version of this result, postponing the discussion to section 5.5, where the formalism of the internal product will be needed. <p> X R 1 k ;l ; it is easy to see that this last expression is equal to 1 i0 X R l + l1 X (1) i R i;l + i2;l1 X R 2i : 5.5 Continuous Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formulas In this section, we shall obtain the main results of <ref> [BMP] </ref> and [MP] by means of compu tations with the internal product and noncommutative Eulerian polynomials. To explain the method, we first treat the problem of the continuous BCH exponents (cf. Section 4.10). For us, the problem is to express (t) in terms of the I . <p> Using the expression of Eulerian idempotents on the basis of descent classes and changing the variables in the multiple integrals, one can as above get rid of the summations over permutations by introducing an appropriate kernel. As explained in <ref> [BMP] </ref> and [MP], such a transformation is always possible, and to find the general expression of the kernel associated to an arbitrary analytic function g (t), we just have to find it for the particular series f z (t) = z t X 1 62 since by the Cauchy integral formula

Reference-contexts: Theorem 9.1 A series f 2 K &lt;&lt; A &gt;&gt; is rational if and only if it is recognizable. The link between this notion of rationality and the one considered in Section 8 of the present paper is provided by a result of Fliess ([Fl], see also <ref> [Ca] </ref>): when the free field is realized as the subfield of the field of Malcev-Neumann series over the free group F (A) generated by the K-alpgebra of F (A), one has K rat &lt;&lt; A &gt;&gt;= K &lt;&lt; A &gt;&gt; " K 6&lt; A 6&gt;.

Reference-contexts: Let K 6&lt; A 6&gt; be the free field constructed on K and generated by A. This is the universal field of fractions of the free associative algebra KhAi (cf. <ref> [Co] </ref>). The matrix A = (a ij ) 1i;jn is called the generic matrix of order n. This matrix is invertible over K 6&lt; A 6&gt;. Let A pq denote the matrix obtained from the generic matrix A by deleting the p-th row and the q-th column. <p> For more details on the category of fields and specializations, see <ref> [Co] </ref>. 7.1 Rational symmetric functions of n noncommutative vari ables We fix n noncommutative indeterminates x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n , the variable t still being a commutative indeterminate.

As an illustration, let us sketch an automata theoretic proof of Proposition 2.6.

Reference-contexts: The systematic use of quasi-Schur functions enables one to derive all these results in a straightforward and unified way. These topics gave rise to an enormous literature in the past twenty years, as shown by the 250 titles compiled by Draux in his commented bibliography <ref> [Dr] </ref>. We shall indicate only a few of them, the reader being referred to this source for precise attributions and bibliographical informations. <p> In the commutative case, these fractions are called J -fractions, and their connexion with orthogonal polynomials and Pade approximants is well-known (cf.

The following ones have a rather simple interpretation in the noncommutative setting : they just give the transition matrices between several natural bases of the Eulerian subalgebras.

Reference-contexts: Thus, A (n; k) is equal to the number of standard ribbon-shaped Young tableaux, whose shape is encoded by a composition with exactly k parts, so that A (n; k)=n! is the image by the specialization S i 7! 1=i! of the symmetric function (introduced by Foulkes in <ref> [F2] </ref>) : A (n; k) = jIj=n R I : (86) These symmetric functions remain meaningful (and can in fact be better understood) in the noncommutative setting.

Reference-contexts: Schur functions belonging to the ring Q [ 1 ; 3 ; 5 ; : : :] are the one indexed by staircase partitions n , so that Laguerre's problem is equivalent to expressing a symmetric polynomial of n indeterminates as a rational function of the staircase Schur functions (cf. <ref> [F3] </ref>). Note that in the noncommutative setting, this no longer holds. For example S 12 = R 12 = 1=3 3 1=6 12 + 1=6 21 + 1=3 111 ; does not belong to Q [ 1 ; 3 ; 5 ; : : :].

Reference-contexts: This comultiplication endows Sym with the structure of a self-dual Hopf algebra, which is very useful for calculations involving characters of symmetric groups (see for instance <ref> [Gei] </ref>, [Zel], [ST] or [Th]). <p> Formula (42) then follows from Theorem 1.7 of [GR1]. Proposition 3.3 can also be interpreted in the Hopf algebra formalism. Let us consider the comultiplication defined in Sym by ( k ) = 1 k + k 1 (43) for k 1. Then, as in the commutative case (cf. <ref> [Gei] </ref> for instance), the elementary and complete functions form infinite sequences of divided powers. Proposition 3.8 For every k 1, one has (S k ) = i=0 k X fl i fl ki : Proof | We prove the claim for (S k ), the other proof being similar.

Reference-contexts: Several algebraic and linear bases are obtained in this way, including two families of "power-sums", corresponding to two different noncommutative analogs of the logarithmic derivative of a power series. Moreover, most of the determinantal relations of the classical theory remain valid, provided that determinants be replaced by quasi-determinants (cf. <ref> [GR1] </ref>, [GR2] or [KL]). In the commutative theory, Schur functions constitute the fundamental linear basis of the space of symmetric functions. <p> This question is considered in Section 4. It is worth noting that the rigidity of the noncommutative theory leads to an explicit description of most of these matrices. We also investigate the general quasi-Schur functions. As demonstrated in <ref> [GR1] </ref> or [GR2], the natural object replacing the determinant in noncommutative linear algebra is the quasi-determinant, which is an analog of the ratio of two determinants. Similarly, Schur functions will be replaced by quasi-Schur functions, which are analogs of the ratio of two ordinary Schur functions. <p> are adjoint to each other iff (XY; 1) = I For example, writing (XY; 1) = Q i (Y; x i ) and expanding the product, one obtains that the adjoint basis of S I is formed by the monomial functions I . 2.2 Quasi-determinants Quasi-determinants have been defined in <ref> [GR1] </ref> and further developed in [GR2] and [KL]. <p> fi fi fi fi fi fi fl 0 fl 1 : : : fl n2 fl n1 . . . . . . . . . fi fi fi fi fi fi : (41) Proof | Formulas (37) and (38) follow from relations (30) by means of Theorem 1.8 of <ref> [GR1] </ref>.

It is worth noting that the rigidity of the noncommutative theory leads to an explicit description of most of these matrices. We also investigate the general quasi-Schur functions. As demonstrated in [GR1] or <ref> [GR2] </ref>, the natural object replacing the determinant in noncommutative linear algebra is the quasi-determinant, which is an analog of the ratio of two determinants. Similarly, Schur functions will be replaced by quasi-Schur functions, which are analogs of the ratio of two ordinary Schur functions. <p> iff (XY; 1) = I For example, writing (XY; 1) = Q i (Y; x i ) and expanding the product, one obtains that the adjoint basis of S I is formed by the monomial functions I . 2.2 Quasi-determinants Quasi-determinants have been defined in [GR1] and further developed in <ref> [GR2] </ref> and [KL]. <p> fi fi fi te 21 1 + t (e 22 1) : : : te 2n . . . . . . fi fi fi fi fi := 2S n generate the center Z (U (gl n )) of U (gl n ). 78 It is shown in [GR1] and <ref> [GR2] </ref> that the Capelli determinant can be expressed as a product of quasi-determinants. <p> Note 7.25 Theorem 7.24 is stated in <ref> [GR2] </ref> in its formal differential operator version. <p> continued S-fractions, which are the series defined by a 0 1 + a 1 t . . . 1 + a n t . . .

[MvR]) that this dual can be identified with another interesting generalisation of symmetric functions, that is, the algebra d Qsym of quasi-symmetric functions, whose definition is due to Gessel (see <ref> [Ge] </ref>). 6.1 Quasi-symmetric functions Let X = fx 1 &lt; x 2 &lt; x 3 &lt; : : : g be an infinite totally ordered set of commuting indeter-minates. <p> In particular, the dimension of Qsym n is 2 n1 = dim Sym n .

That is, when f is a symmetric function, fl (f ) = f (X + Y ) and -(f) = f (X). As shown in <ref> [Ge] </ref>, the other coproduct ffi of Sym can also be extended to d Qsym. <p> The extension of ffi to d Qsym is then defined by setting ffi (f ) = f (X ^ fiY ) for f 2 d Qsym. 6.2 The pairing between Sym and d Qsym It has been shown in <ref> [Ge] </ref> that the dual space Qsym fl n endowed with the product adjoint to ffi is anti-isomorphic to the descent algebra n .

Reference-contexts: In the above example, we have I = (3; 1; 1; 4; 2). Following <ref> [MM] </ref>, we also define the conjugate composition I ~ of I as the one whose associated ribbon is the conjugate (in the sense of skew diagrams) of the ribbon of I. <p> In the commutative case, the skew Schur functions indexed by ribbon diagrams possess interesting properties and are strongly related to the combinatorics of compositions and descents of permutations (cf. [Ge], [GeR] or [Re] for instance). They have been defined and investigated by MacMahon (cf. <ref> [MM] </ref>). Although the commutative ribbon functions are not linearly independent, e.g. R 12 = R 21 , it will be shown in Section 4 that the noncommutative ones form a linear basis of Sym. <p> In the commutative case, they are the hook Schur functions, denoted S (1 k ;nk) . We shall also use this notation for the noncommutative ones. We have for the multiplication of ribbon Schur functions the following formula, whose commutative version is due to MacMahon (cf. <ref> [MM] </ref>). Proposition 3.13 Let I = (i 1 ; : : : ; i r ) and J = (j 1 ; : : : ; j s ) be two compositions. <p> This is the noncommutative analog of a formula of MacMahon (cf. <ref> [MM] </ref>). <p> To give a precise statement, we need the notion (due to MacMahon, cf. <ref> [MM] </ref>) of major index of a permutation.

Reference-contexts: The algebra of commutative symmetric functions has a canonical scalar product, for which it is self-dual as a Hopf algebra. In the noncommutative theory, the algebra of symmetric functions differs from its dual, which, as shown in <ref> [MvR] </ref>, can be identified with the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions (Section 6). Another classical subject in the commutative theory is the description of the transition matrices between the various natural bases. This question is considered in Section 4. <p> A reason for this is that is cocommutative, and cannot be dual to a noncommutative multiplication. One has thus to look for the dual bialgebra Sym fl of Sym. It follows from a recent work by Malvenuto and Reutenauer (cf. <ref> [MvR] </ref>) that this dual can be identified with another interesting generalisation of symmetric functions, that is, the algebra d Qsym of quasi-symmetric functions, whose definition is due to Gessel (see [Ge]). 6.1 Quasi-symmetric functions Let X = fx 1 &lt; x 2 &lt; x 3 &lt; : : : g be <p> Using the standard identification d Qsym d Qsym d Qsym (X; Y ) (series which are separately quasi-symmetric in X and Y ) defined by f g f (X) g (Y ), Malvenuto and Reutenauer (cf. <ref> [MvR] </ref>) defined a coproduct fl on d Qsym by setting fl (f) = f (X ^ +Y ) (108) for f 2 d Qsym. <p> The dual Hopf algebra d Qsym fl of the whole algebra of quasi-symmetric series has been recently identified in <ref> [MvR] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As already mentioned, formula (70) permits the recursive computation of the n in terms of iterated integrals. There exists, however, an explicit expression of this type, which is due to Bialynicki-Birula, Mielnik and Peblanski [BMP] (see also <ref> [MP] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This can be explained by an interesting realization of noncommutative symmetric functions, as a certain subalgebra of the convolution algebra of a free associative algebra (interpreted as a Hopf algebra in an appropriate way). This algebra is discussed at length in the recent book <ref> [Re] </ref> by C. Reutenauer, where one finds many interesting results which can be immediately translated in the language of noncommutative symmetric functions. We illustrate this correspondence on several examples. <p> Moreover the difference k k lies in the Lie ideal L 2 () for every k 1.
