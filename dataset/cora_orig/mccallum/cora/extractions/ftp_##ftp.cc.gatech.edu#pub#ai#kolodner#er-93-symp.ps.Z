Abstract: Designers across a variety of domains engage in many of the same creative activities. Since much creativity stems from using old solutions in novel ways, we believe that case-based reasoning can be used to explain many creative design processes.

Reference-contexts: In general, they are incomplete, leave many different ways to solve a problem, and are often unnecessarily overconstrained. An important part of design is redefining the design specification. This includes elaborating the constraints and criteria the design should satisfy and extensively restructuring the problem <ref> (Goel and Pirolli, 1989) </ref>. 2.1 ELABORATION In general, a designer has goals and guidelines that are not in the initial design specification itself but whose violation or achievement can be noticed. <p> Another problem reformulation technique is to explore and stretch the problem constraints and exploit any loop-holes found. For example, a designer trying to "design a building between two buildings" <ref> (Goel and Pirolli, 1989) </ref> might ask how close the middle building can be to the two adjacent buildings.

Reference-contexts: In creative design, it sometimes makes sense, in addition, to adapt one's goals to fit an old solution rather than changing the old solution to fit the new problem (e.g., using rice for breakfast rather than dinner). Previous work <ref> (Hinrichs 1992) </ref> has looked at routine adaptation strategies (e.g., deletion, addition, substitution) but not at use of "off-the-cuff" ones (i.e., those developed in response to a particular problem).
