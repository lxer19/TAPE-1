Abstract: The development of high-speed networks and global internetworking protocols enable new, multimedia-oriented, applications to emerge, such as teleconferencing and other collaborative applications, or video-on-demand. These new applications rely on the underlying communication infrastructure to be able to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, typically in form of delay and jitter bounds. Appropriate admission control during connection establishment is necessary for the underlying communication infrastructure to satisfy the above QoS requirements. Admission control is used in conjunction with a resource reservation protocol that reserve resources at communication establishment time. Existing resource reservation algorithms are limited when it comes to reserving resources for multiparty communication environments, in particular for multicast connections. We propose a new protocol for connection establishment in a real-time one-to-many communication environment. This algorithm very effectively allocates resources for connections along their multicast routes, and thus reduces call-blocking probabilities and increases resource utilization while providing QoS guarantees. This is illustrated with a suite of simulation experiments, which compares the performance of our approach with that of other existing protocols.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we describe a novel three-pass establishment protocol that allows for resource relaxation on multicast connections. We compare the performance with existing establishment protocols in Section 4. 2 Background In real-time communication <ref> [1] </ref>, the quality of communication depends on the time at which messages are successfully delivered to the recipients. Network Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are typically formulated in terms of performance metrics such as deadline, delay jitter, and loss rate.

Reference-contexts: ADV message "advertise" the end-to-end QoS guarantees provided with given local resource allocations at the nodes on the route. Nodes on the route evaluate the end-to-end delay resulting from per-link service requests, and choose the desired level of service. Tenet Suite 2 <ref> [4, 13] </ref> uses a two-pass allocation scheme patterned after Tenet Suite 1 [8, 10], which is extended by providing support for multiparty.

Reference-contexts: To solve these problems, we suggest a Three-Pass Establishment Protocol, which will be described in Section 3. Dynamic Resource Migration (DRM) <ref> [5] </ref> is a gradient-based dynamic resource reservation protocol using a one-pass establishment protocol. During the establishment, no attempt is made to relax resource allocations; that is, local resource managers allocate resources at will in the attempt to meet the end-to-end requirements. <p> In each figure, we compare the connection acceptance rate of the Three-Pass protocol proposed in this work with the traditional Tenet Suite 2 [13] establishment protocol, and the Dynamic Resource Migration protocol <ref> [5] </ref> (DRM). As described earlier, the traditional Tenet Scheme 2 protocol is a two-pass establishment that does not perform resource relaxation. DRM is a one-pass establishment protocol that relies on a dynamic local balancing scheme to adapt the resource allocations dynamically to the changing load in the network.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the obvious reduction in wasted bandwidth the sender is released from having to manage the set of receivers. Adding multicasting capabilities to internetworks, has been achieved only in the past few years, primarily with multicast IP <ref> [6] </ref>. Multicast IP consists of extensions to routing protocols to allow subnetworks to advertise (through their routers) whether they wish to receive datagrams sent to particular sets of servers (called multicast group). Routing information for a particular multicast group is shared. <p> In order to conserve resources, the underlying network service must be able to support a point-to-multipoint connection abstraction (e.g, hostgroups in multicast IP <ref> [6] </ref> or target sets in Tenet Scheme 2 [12, 13]) and an appropriate mechanism to support multicasting at network level. 2.2 Real-Time Internetworking Protocols A number of establishment protocols for internetworks have been proposed in the literature. Some representative approaches are described below.

Reference-contexts: necessary resources are reserved for the newly established connection. 6 2.1 Multiparty Communication Newly emerging applications in distributed multimedia and distributed simulation are increasingly expected to support a multiparty environment, in which connections are set up between a sender and multiple receivers (point-to-multipoint) or multiple senders and multiple receivers (multipoint-to-multipoint) <ref> [7] </ref>.

Suite 2 uses target sets as receiver abstraction, and provides extensive functionality needed for multiparty, such as sender-initiated, and receiver-initiated establishment, dynamic membership in target sets, resource sharing among connections, third-party operations, and advance reservation.

Reference-contexts: A number of real-time communication protocols have been developed that allow the 5 network service to provide the applications with the required QoS guarantees. The basic paradigm used in such protocols is that of the "performance contract" <ref> [9] </ref>; during a separate connection establishment process, the network service and the application enter an agreement that the network service guarantees the required QoS as long as the traffic generated by the sender does not exceed a specified amount. <p> If necessary, the network service can police the traffic stream, that is, drop the excessive traffic. The mechanisms that enable such a performance contract are the following <ref> [9] </ref>: * Connection oriented service: This allows the underlying network to make decisions based on longer lasting connections instead of individual packets. * Traffic specification: This provides the underlying service with information about the traffic that is expected to be generated by the source.

The establishment of a real-time multiparty channel happens as follows: First, RCAP gets a possible route for the channel from the routing subsystem. The server then issues a reservation message which contains the traffic specification for the channel. <p> Figures 6 and 5 depict connection acceptance rates as functions of increasing connection arrival rates for varying numbers of destinations per connection. In each figure, we compare the connection acceptance rate of the Three-Pass protocol proposed in this work with the traditional Tenet Suite 2 <ref> [13] </ref> establishment protocol, and the Dynamic Resource Migration protocol [5] (DRM). As described earlier, the traditional Tenet Scheme 2 protocol is a two-pass establishment that does not perform resource relaxation.

Reference-contexts: As we describe below, this reservation mechanism is not well suited for multicast connections. * RSVP with OPWA <ref> [15] </ref> allows nodes along the multicast tree to select levels at which they want to support a multicast connection. Resource reservation is a one-pass process sending from the receivers, and advertisement messages which include the end-to-end delay bound are sent periodically from each source to all receivers. <p> However, this scheme supports multicast very well by combining IP multicast and a receiver-initiated connection establishment scheme. In One-Path-With-Advertisement (OPWA) <ref> [15] </ref>, the basic RSVP scheme is extended to give receivers and nodes along routes enough information so that they know the effect of local resource allocations on the end-to-end QoS guarantees. This is done by so-called "advertising" (ADV) control message that are sent from the sources to all receivers.

Reference-contexts: If the test fails, the connection request is denied. The establishment process is aborted by sending a reject message to the source. Otherwise, the establishment message is forwarded to the destinations. The following approaches are a selection of current resource allocation schemes: * In RSVP <ref> [17] </ref>, the resource reservation is done by a one-pass mechanism. Once the reservation is established, the reservation request messages are resent periodically to dynamically adapt the change in load. <p> Because each data source makes its reservation independently, a single pipe is reserved from every source to every receiver in the same multicast application group. Thus, neither ST nor ST-2 provide a robust and efficient solution to the multicast resource reservation problem. In RSVP <ref> [17] </ref>, the traffic specification is forwarded from the sender along the multicast tree inform of path message. Receivers establish connections by sending reservation request in the reverse (i.e. upstream) along the multicast tree. The nodes along the way reserve the necessary resources to accommodate the new 7 request.

Reference-contexts: In order to simplify the following discussion, we will assume that the nodes in the network use rate-controlled static-priority (RCSP) <ref> [18] </ref> schedulers. We chose this algorithm because it makes the local admission decision particulary simple to describe. Our scheme works for other scheduling algorithms 9 as well, such as EDF, or various forms for regulated EDF (jitter EDD or delay EDD), or combinations thereof. <p> During system configuration time, a priori local delay bounds are assigned to each priority level. The higher the priority level assigned to a connection, the lower the local delay bound. By limiting the number of connections at each priority level using the admission control 10 conditions in Equation (1) <ref> [18] </ref>, the waiting time of each packet at a priority level is guaranteed to be less than the delay bound associated with that level: m X i k X d X k;j where d m is the local delay bound previously assigned to priority level m of the scheduler.
