Abstract: Hypertext systems are being used in many applications because of their flexible structure and the great browsing freedom they give to diverse communities of users. However, this same freedom and flexibility is the cause of one of its main problem: the lost in hyperspace problem. One reason for the complexity of hypertext databases is the large number of nodes and links that compose them. To simplify this structure we propose that nodes and links be clustered forming more abstract structures. An abstraction is the concealment of all but relevant properties from an object or concept. One type of abstraction is called an aggregate. An aggregate is a set of distinct concepts that taken together form a more abstract concept. For example, two legs, a trunk, two arms and a head can be aggregate together in a single higher level object called a body. In this paper we will study the hypertext structure, i.e., the way nodes are linked to each other in order to find aggregates in hypertext databases. Two graph theoretical algorithms will be used: biconnected components and strongly connected components.

Reference-contexts: The results were similar in all of them and we will focus our discussion on the Hypertext Hands-On! book (HHO) because it is widely available <ref> [Shn89] </ref>. HHO is the first electronic book commercially published. It has 243 nodes and 803 links. 11 This book was carefully crafted and extensively reviewed to help ensure clear structure and ease of reading. It covers the basic concepts of hypertext, typical hypertext applications, and currently available authoring systems.
