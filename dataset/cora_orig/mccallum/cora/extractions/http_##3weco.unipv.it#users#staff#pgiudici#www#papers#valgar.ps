Abstract: The major implementational problem for reversible jump MCMC is that there is commonly no natural way to choose jump proposals since there is no Euclidean structure to guide our choice. In this paper we will consider a mechanism for guiding the proposal choice by analysis of acceptance probabilities for jumps. Essentially the method involves an approximation for the acceptance probability around certain canonical jumps. We will illustrate the procedure using an example of a reversible jump MCMC application, involving a Bayesian analysis of graphical gaussian models.

Reference-contexts: As for the latter, there appears to be very little theoretical guidance on how to do so, for dimension changing moves. While there has been considerable progress in this area for fixed-dimension sampling problems <ref> (see e.g. Gelman et. al., 1996, Roberts and Rosenthal, 1998) </ref>, most of the available statistical applications of reversible jump techniques rely on various strategies of empirical tuning, essentially based on estimating the value of the scaling factor on the basis of appropriately chosen pilot runs. 2 P.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The reversible jump algorithm <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref> is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm designed for allowing movement between different dimensional spaces. Commonly these spaces are just competing models with different sets of parameters. Constructing appropriate classes of jumps is often difficult since there is no natural neighbourhood structure between models to guide us.

Reference-contexts: A conditional independence graph, G = (V; E), describes the association structure of X by means of a graph, specified by the vertex set V and the edge set E. A graphical model is a family of probability distributions P G which is Markov over G <ref> (see, for instance, Lauritzen, 1996) </ref>. A graphical Gaussian model is obtained when only continuous random variables are considered and assuming P G = N (; G ), with G positive definite and such that P G is Markov over G.
