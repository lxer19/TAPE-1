Reference-contexts: The dependencies between the SVIQUEL sliders are discussed in Section 8. Section 9 reviews related work and Section 10 concludes the paper. 2 Background 2.1 Dynamic Query Filters Our spatial query filters are based on double-thumbed filters <ref> [All] </ref> as shown in Figure 1. The double thumbed slider provides a direct manipulation interface for selecting a continuous range of values from a continuous domain. In the double thumbed dynamic query filter, each thumb has an arrow, pointing towards the range being specified.

Reference-contexts: Users explore and analyze the spatial data through iterative specification of queries using our Spatial Visual Query Language (SVIQUEL) and reviewing the visualization of the results (SVIZ). The SVIQUEL interface is composed of dynamic query filters to allow rapid adjustment of query parameters via the use of sliders <ref> [AWS92] </ref>. This is in contrast to text-based query languages where query specification and modification is typically much more complicated and non-intuitive. 5 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on applying the VIS paradigm to spatial data types in a principled manner.

Reference-contexts: In other words, if both the objects are translated or rotated in the same manner, then their topological relationship still remains the same. Egenhofer's 4-intersection model <ref> [EF95] </ref> provides us with a means of classifying the various topologies into eight distinct categories: Disjoint, Meet, Overlaps, Equal, Contains, Inside, Covers and Covered By. This model considers the intersection values of the objects' boundaries and interiors.

Reference-contexts: If the 4-intersection values of two pairs of point sets have different contents, then their topological relations are different as well, however the reverse cannot be stated. In order to arrive at a one to one correspondence between a value and a relation, Egenhofer further refined this 4-intersection model <ref> [EM95] </ref> by also considering the intersection between the object's exteriors (9-intersection model). This model gives a unique value for each topological relationship between two pairs of point sets. 2.2.2 Directional Relations Directional relations are those spatial relations that deal with order in space between two objects.

Reference-contexts: As we have discussed earlier, each SPRIM in our model is a combination of both topology and direction. We need to find a way of combining the individual neighborhood models proposed in the literature for direction [Her94] (see Figure 9) and with those for topology <ref> [ET92] </ref> (see Figure 8) respectively in order to develop an integrated neighborhood model. 12 For topology, we borrow the concept of neighborhoods among topological spatial relations between a line and a region (see Figure 8) as introduced in [ET92]. <p> literature for direction [Her94] (see Figure 9) and with those for topology <ref> [ET92] </ref> (see Figure 8) respectively in order to develop an integrated neighborhood model. 12 For topology, we borrow the concept of neighborhoods among topological spatial relations between a line and a region (see Figure 8) as introduced in [ET92]. This model considers the intersections between the interior, boundary and the exterior of the line and the region, and differentiates between the topologies based on these 9 intersection values. For direction, we use the concept of neighborhood as developed by Hernandez [Her94] (see Figurefig7).

Reference-contexts: As each of the sliders can specify a range of values, users could ask for a combination of two spatial relations in a query. Since, these sliders can only specify a continuous range of values, they can only specify those combinations that are "neighbors" of each other <ref> [Fre] </ref>. Our neighborhood model enables us to arrive at what these legal combinations are in the case when these two spatial properties are combined. <p> This observation requires us to establish a precise definition for this intuitive concept of neighborhood viz the relations closest to a given relation form a neighborhood. Little work has been done in modeling conceptual neighborhoods among spatial relations. Freska <ref> [Fre] </ref> introduced the concept of neighborhood with respect to 1D temporal data.

Reference-contexts: They can be viewed at two levels: * Qualitative level giving linguistic terms such as near, far and so on. * Quantitative level giving the actual distance in a particular unit. There have been a number of approaches to calculate distance between two regions <ref> [Her94] </ref>. Given two points in any N dimensional space, it is very straightforward to compute the Euclidean distance between them. <p> Some of the existing approaches [JTS96] that have explicitly dealt with the integration of topological and directional relations are aimed at building a spatial inference engine. That is, they attempt to infer the spatial relationship between two objects, given a heterogeneous set of both topological and directional relationships. Hernandez <ref> [Her94] </ref> discusses the advantages of combining both topology and direction into one positional relationship and we propose to use these concepts for our direct manipulation 2D spatial environment. 3 Overview of Our Approach analysis [AS94] [HR95]. <p> Rectangle (MBR) with its sides oriented along the X and Y axes, and the spatial relationship between the two objects is expressed in terms of its MBR 8 (SPRIMs) and not 64 is that for certain topologies like inside, contains or equals having a directional component is not very meaningful <ref> [Her94] </ref>. The SPRIMs as given in Figure 4 can be depicted in terms of the differences between the left and right ends in the X dimension and top and bottom ends in the Y dimension of the two objects A and B. <p> As we have discussed earlier, each SPRIM in our model is a combination of both topology and direction. We need to find a way of combining the individual neighborhood models proposed in the literature for direction <ref> [Her94] </ref> (see Figure 9) and with those for topology [ET92] (see Figure 8) respectively in order to develop an integrated neighborhood model. 12 For topology, we borrow the concept of neighborhoods among topological spatial relations between a line and a region (see Figure 8) as introduced in [ET92]. <p> This model considers the intersections between the interior, boundary and the exterior of the line and the region, and differentiates between the topologies based on these 9 intersection values. For direction, we use the concept of neighborhood as developed by Hernandez <ref> [Her94] </ref> (see Figurefig7). Given our goal of querying over both topology and direction, we propose to develop a neighborhood model for an aggregate relationship integrating both direction and topology. In short, our proposed neighborhood model is a natural extension of the two individual models. <p> Also, while a number of papers [JTS96] [SYLL95] focus on building an inference engine for a heterogeneous collection of directional and topological relations, no one besides <ref> [Her94] </ref> attempts to aggregate them into one composite relationship.

We extend this work by giving a concrete definition to the concept of neighborhood when direction and topology are combined into one 20 aggregate relation. <p> Also, while a number of papers [JTS96] [SYLL95] focus on building an inference engine for a heterogeneous collection of directional and topological relations, no one besides <ref> [Her94] </ref> attempts to aggregate them into one composite relationship.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to apply the concept of visual information seeking to systems with special-purpose data types such as spatial and temporal data. Our previous work, focussed on designing a direct manipulation environment for one dimensional temporal data, called TVQL <ref> [HR95] </ref>, allowed a user to visually specify temporal queries over video data giving an instantaneous visualization of the results of the query. <p> Our Spatial Visual Query and Exploration Language (SVIQUEL) allows the user to query over the relative spatial position of two sets of objects capturing both the topological and directional part of the relationship. The query filters, based on the dynamic query filters used in TVQL <ref> [HR95] </ref>, are tailored for spatial analysis allowing users to pose queries as well as to browse the data in a spatially continuous manner. <p> Hernandez [Her94] discusses the advantages of combining both topology and direction into one positional relationship and we propose to use these concepts for our direct manipulation 2D spatial environment. 3 Overview of Our Approach analysis [AS94] <ref> [HR95] </ref>. Users explore and analyze the spatial data through iterative specification of queries using our Spatial Visual Query Language (SVIQUEL) and reviewing the visualization of the results (SVIZ). The SVIQUEL interface is composed of dynamic query filters to allow rapid adjustment of query parameters via the use of sliders [AWS92]. <p> We extend the VIS paradigm to exploit the characteristics inherent in spatial data such as the spatial continuity of the data, the possibility of sliding from a disjoint to a overlap position in one continuous motion, and the dependencies between the various spatial properties such as direction and topology [HR96a] <ref> [HR95] </ref>. In particular, we re-examine the basic spatial query types of both topology and direction to develop a spatial query model that consistently integrates those two spatial query classes thus avoiding the combination of inappropriate spatial predicates and the specification of meaningless queries. <p> We have thus reduced the two dimensional data dependencies to the treatment of two independent one dimensional query filters, the remaining discussion thus parallels work on one-dimensional slider dependencies <ref> [HR95] </ref>. 8.2 Dependencies Between the Filters in One Dimension Below, we consider the dependencies among the four filters in the X dimension, while the same also holds true for those in the Y dimension. <p> Our work provides support for two kinds of users, those who know what they are looking for and those who are just browsing the database. Our SVIQUEL is based on our earlier work of building visual interfaces, in particular, the Temporal Visual Query Language <ref> [HR95] </ref> [HR96a] [HR97], designed to handle queries over one dimensional temporal data. We extend this work to two-dimensional spatial data and deal with the dependencies introduced between the two dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Borrowing this idea of qualitative query disambiguation of MMVIS <ref> [HR96b] </ref> , we now propose to add a Spatial Query Disambiguation diagram as part of the SVIQUEL palette (SQUAD) to give visual qualitative representations of the query to the user.

Reference-contexts: User interface studies of the TVQL show that the users could more accurately specify and more quickly adjust queries using TVQL than using a forms-based approach <ref> [HR97] </ref> indicating the promise of our approach. This positive feedback now caused us to extend our previous work to spatial data types. In this current paper, we apply this concept of direct manipulation to the two dimensional (2D) domain of spatial data. <p> specifies a combination of two neighboring SPRIMs in his query (see Figure 6). 5 SQUAD: Spatial Query Disambiguation Diagram Formal user studies of temporal queries in MMVIS have shown that a graphical depiction of a slider-based query for query disambiguation results in better performance and easier comprehension for the users <ref> [HR97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is not that obvious in the case of computing the distance between two regions which are two dimensional, as many different distance measures could be chosen to capture the distance between such complex object pairs. Some of the earlier work on distance <ref> [KSF + 96] </ref> between two objects views distance as the degree of similarity between the objects. So, the greater the distance, less similar are the objects. On the other hand, we view distance as the actual spatial distance between the two regions.

Reference-contexts: One of the goals of our work is thus to enhance the dynamic sliders for such continuous spatial queries. 3 2.2 Spatial Query Types Spatial queries are often processed qualitatively with the use of spatial relations. Spatial relations can be broadly classified into three basic categories <ref> [TP95] </ref>: * Topological Relations * Directional Relations * Distance Relations 2.2.1 Topological Relations Topological relations are those spatial relations which are preserved under groups of continuous transformations such as translation and rotation. <p> There are essentially two broad categories for directional relations that are commonly used in the literature [JTS96] <ref> [TP95] </ref>. * 4 way direction - (North, South, East, West) * 8 way direction - (North, South, East, West, North East, North West, South East, South West) The choice between these two models of directional relations depends on the level of granularity or precision at which these relations are to be <p> They however require the user to be aware of what he is looking for and are not of much use to a user who is just browsing the spatial database in search of something interesting. Theodoridis <ref> [TP95] </ref> gives a classification of all spatial relations into three main categories as topological, directional or distance relations. We combine the two types of spatial relationships of direction and topology into one composite relation and have built one query interface to query over this composite relation.

Reference-contexts: VIS principles include dynamic query filters, visualization of the results and tight coupling to preserve display invariants and support progressive refinement. The Dynamic Homefinder, a Real Estate Information Exploration System based on VIS principles <ref> [WS92] </ref>, allows users to search for a house that meets their criteria by manipulating sliders for different input parameters (such as number of rooms, price etc) and to get a visual display of the results. <p> Selected ranges between the two filter thumbs are filled. The text above the slider indicates the exact value. Dynamic query filters are used in the Dynamic Homefinder application <ref> [WS92] </ref> to specify a range of values for various parameters of the house such as its cost, number of rooms and distance from a reference point. However, the Dynamic Homefinder application does not allow the user to specify the relative spatial position of two objects.
