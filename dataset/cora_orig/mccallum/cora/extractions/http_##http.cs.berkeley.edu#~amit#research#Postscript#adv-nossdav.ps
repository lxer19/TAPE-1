Title: Distributed advance reservation of real-time connections  
Author: Domenico Ferrari, Amit Gupta, Giorgio Ventre 
Affiliation: Tenet Group University of California at Berkeley, and International Computer Science Institute  
Abstract: The ability to reserve real-time connections in advance is essential in all distributed multi-party applications (i.e., applications involving multiple human beings) using a network that controls admissions to provide good quality of service. This paper discusses the requirements of the clients of an advance reservation service, and a distributed design for such a service. The design is described within the context of the Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite 2, a suite being developed for multi-party communication, which will offer advance reservation capabilities to its clients based on the principles and the mechanisms proposed in the paper. Some simulation results about the performance of these mechanisms are also presented.

Reference-contexts: This complication can be avoided, and the establishment of immediate channels still kept as fast as possible, by separating the two types of channels so that the admission tests for a new channel only take into account the channels of its type in each server.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation of the possible policies is a topic for future research. 4 A simulation-based evaluation We performed a number of simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the resource partitioning algorithms. Because of space limitations, we present only two sets of simulation experiments here (see <ref> [8] </ref> for many more results). In the first set, we ran simulations of resource requests for a simple traffic characterization, with and without the advance reservation mechanisms, while the second set evaluated the effect of time granularity on the performance of advance reservation mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: In the establishment of immediate channels, which in the scheme described in <ref> [9] </ref> only considers the situation at the time the request is made, we must now look at all the future situations as well: Figure 1 shows a case in which no immediate channel can be created through a server (i.e., a network component that has resources to be allocated) at time <p> Resource partitioning [7, 10], a service the Tenet Suite 2 [2] will offer network managers, is an almost perfect solution for this problem.

The advance partition must instead use a different mechanism (to be presented in Section 3.2) to test new requests for admission. Fig. 1. A request for an immediate channel cannot be accepted at time t 1 , even though the resource is 100% free at that time.

The partition-based solution raises, however, a problem: each resource has to be allocated statically to each partition, and this may cause inefficiencies due to fragmentation <ref> [10] </ref> and, worse, to poor allocation decisions; one of the two partitions for a resource may be saturated while the other is almost empty.

In Section 3, we describe the distributed advance reservations mechanisms we have designed for, and are implementing in, the Tenet Suite 2 <ref> [11] </ref>. The principles on which our mechanisms are based, however, are easily portable to other approaches and protocols for real-time communication.

Reference-contexts: In this workload, there exist resource sharing relationships among the conference channels (only up to 2 of the channels constituting a conference may be active at any given time) so that they can share resource allocations <ref> [12] </ref>. In Figure 3, there is a large region in which the acceptance ratio is higher than 1, i.e., in which the acceptance rate is higher with advance reservation mechanisms than without these mechanisms. However, there is also a large region in which the ratio is lower than 1.
