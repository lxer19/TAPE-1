Abstract: The Michelson-Morley experiment is a classical example of a validation attempt that produced a counter-result. I use the experiment to illustrate some fundamental concepts of validation methodology. I illustrate the logic developed by Carnap for scientific work and the computational requirements in numerical processing.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 develops the logic of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Section 5 applies our principles to the experiment. 2. Principles of Computational Science . The basics of validation methodology were laid down by Aristotle in Posterior Analytics. In my 1994 paper [8], I discussed Aristotle's Organon (part of Posterior Analytics) <ref> [1] </ref> and Bacon's Novum Organon [2]. I also proposed the following principles for the correctness of simulations: P1 Physical Exactness. We strive to identify nonphysical (mathematically convenient) assump tions and eliminate them. P2 Computability. We must identify non-computable relationships. Most mathematical relationships in scientific computation turn out to be approximate.

Reference-contexts: The confirmation problem, as the validation problem is known in the philosophy of science literature, was the focus of the philosophy of science from the mid-1930s until the mid-1960s. This focus arose from events in 19th Century science. Carnap's 1936 and 1937 articles entitled "Testability and Meaning" <ref> [3] </ref> are the first in a lengthy development in the logical framework of confirmation. Carnap, together with Carl Hempel (1905-1997) and others, developed "logical framework" for confirmation. <p> Counterfactuals are subjunctive implication: the false case simply is uninteresting and does not occur because it is presupposed in the antecedent. Counterfactual inference is model-based. Then why do we need counterfactuals? Car-nap <ref> [3] </ref> considers the term soluble in water: "x is soluble in water" means "Whenever anything x is put into water, x dissolves." Suppose we have the following: Q 1 (x; t) The body x is placed in water at time t.

Reference-contexts: The results of the experiment were generally taken as inconclusive due to apparatus problems.

There were criticisms of the experiment. A second article appeared in November, 1887 [7]. While there was much more controversy to come, the fate of ether had been sealed.

Interestingly enough, the experimental plan of Michelson and Morley was never carried to completion. Only two complete sets of observations were taken out of a year-long protocol.

Reference-contexts: Understanding | indeed including | scientific reasoning in the mathematically intense theoretical model and how to logically link the observation and theoretical models is a wide open question. I present an expansion of these ideas in <ref> [9] </ref>. Perhaps the most interesting lesson of all is that the physicists I talked look for consistency among many different values. Such scientists consider ranges of values more than a single, "correct" number.
