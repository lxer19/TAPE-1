Abstract: Single-fault, multi-fault, 0-1 static sensitizable path and robust path delay fault are often used to measure the testability of a circuit. In this paper, we explore the relationships among these testabilities. In addition to the relationships discovered before, we have proved that 100% single fault testability, 100% 0-1 static sensitizability are equivalent in two-level single-output circuits. We have also proved that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability implies 100% multi-fault testability, and that 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% multi-fault testability in two-level circuits. Several new conditions for gate merging while keeping 100% single-fault testability are presented. We further proved that the three transformations (D 1;1;2 [9], extraction, DeMorgan) which was proved to keep 100% single fault testability also preserve 100% multiple-fault testability, 100% multi-fault testability, 100% robust path delay fault testability. We have answered the following two open questions in this paper: 1) Does 100% multi-fault testability in a multiple outputs circuit not require 100% 0-1 static sensitiz-ability? 2) Does 100% multi-fault testability in a single output circuit imply 100% 0-1 static sensitizability?

Reference-contexts: An example in [3] was given to show that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability does not imply 100% multi-fault testability. However, many other relationships are still needed to be investigated. For example, Devadas and Keutzer <ref> [2] </ref> conjectured and proved 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% multifault testability. Unfortunately the proof for the above claim is not complete. <p> We also prove that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability implies 100% multifault testability in two-level circuits. Therefore, 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% multifault testability. This conforms that the conjecture of Devadas and Keutzer <ref> [2] </ref> is correct for two level circuits. We also give two examples, the first example is a two-level multiple output circuit with 100% multifault testability, but the circuit is not 100% 0-1 static sensitizability. <p> Since 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% 0-1 static sensitizability, we have: Corollary 2: 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% multi-fault testa bility in two-level circuits. Corollary 2 proves that the conjecture of Devads and Keutzer <ref> [2] </ref> is true for two level circuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several relationships among single-fault testability, multi-fault testability, robust path de lay fault testability and 0-1 static sensitizability have been previously investigated. It was proved [4] that two-level single-output circuits that are single-fault testable are also multi fault testable. However, this is not true for general circuits <ref> [3] </ref>. It is also well known that 1 100% robust path-delay-fault testability implies 100% 0-1 static sensitizability. An example in [3] was given to show that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability does not imply 100% multi-fault testability.

In general, there is no relationships between 100% multi-fault testability and 100% 0-1 static sensitizability. However, we have found that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability implies 100% multiple fault testability in two-level multiple output circuit. In order to prove Theorem 3, we introduce a lemma first. <p> There are still some open questions: [1] Does 100% robust path delay fault testability imply 100% multi-fault testability for multi-level circuits ?

Reference-contexts: However, many other relationships are still needed to be investigated. For example, Devadas and Keutzer [2] conjectured and proved 100% robust path delay fault testability implies 100% multifault testability. Unfortunately the proof for the above claim is not complete. Alexander <ref> [8] </ref> proposed the following two open questions. a) Does 100% multifault testability in a multiple output circuit not require 100% 0-1 static sensitizability ? b) Does 100% multifault testability in a single output circuit imply 100% 0-1 static sensitizability ? It is believed that 100% 0-1 static sensitizability implies 100% single-fault <p> The second example is a single output circuit with 100% multifault testability, the circuit is not 100% 0-1 static sensitizability. These two examples answer the two questions raised by Alexander <ref> [8] </ref>. The quality of a circuit is usually measured by performance, area and testability. In order to meet the timing requirement, a given circuit may be synthesised to satisfy the performance criterion with minimal area increase. However, during the synthesis process, the testability of the circuit is usually ignored. <p> The transformations preserving 100% multifault testability were investigated in [4], [5], [9]. 2 The transformations keeping 100% robust path delay fault testability were discussed in [7] and [10]. The transformations keeping 100% 0-1 static sensitizability were discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Alexander in his thesis [8] also summarized several transformations and discussed their relationships to these testabilities. Usually, the transformations which keep 100% testability also keep the complete test vectors. <p> When X 3 = 0, H may have a transition. Thus, this path is not rising robust path delay fault testable. We use Figure 2 to express the relationships among these testabilities in two-level single-output circuits. The first question raised by Alexander <ref> [8] </ref> is whether or not 100% multi-fault testability can imply 100% 0-1 static sensitizability for multiple output circuits. We give an example to show that this is not true even for two-level multi-fault circuits. <p> Corollary 2 proves that the conjecture of Devads and Keutzer [2] is true for two level circuits. The relationships among these testabilities for two-level multiple output circuit are il lustrated by Figure 4. sensitizability for multiple level single output circuits. This answers the second question raised by Alexander <ref> [8] </ref>. 9 We can check that this circuit in Figure 5 is 100% multiple fault testable, but we can see that the path X 2 !A! B!E!G!H is not 0 static sensitizable. <p> It is also known that various testabilities of a circuit often changes during the process of logic synthesis. Hence, it is important to investigate the transformations that keep the testabilities mentioned above. Some sufficient conditions for gate merging to keep 100% single fault testability were given in [6] and <ref> [8] </ref>. We further propose several conditions for gate merging to keep 100% single fault testability. Theorem 4 Let H be a 100% single-fault testable network with identical gates n 0 , n 1 , ..., n k . <p> For any gate G, any path from any n i ( i=1, 2, 3, 4, ..., k) to G (if there exists a path from n i to G) has the same parity. Proof According to <ref> [8] </ref>, the redundant connections may only be created on the merged gate ( either on the inputs or the outputs). We will prove that this can not happen under the above condition. <p> There exists a gate G such that all the n i to any primary output must pass G and all the paths from any n i to gate G has the same parity. Proof 11 According to <ref> [8] </ref>, the redundant connections may only be created on the merged gate (either on the input or output leads). <p> We answered two questions raised by Alexander <ref> [8] </ref>. The conjecture of Davadas and Keutzer [2] has been proved to be correct for two-level circuits.
