Abstract: We compare two types of multiprocessor interconnection networks, fat trees and express cubes. Sample networks of each type were designed using realistic hardware constraints. We model different communication patterns on them and compute metrics such as average hop count, average latency, and bisection bandwidth, and show approximate costs for each network in terms of router and wire counts. Results show that two dimensional express cubes provide slightly lower hop counts across most communication patterns, and provide much lower hop counts when communicating directly with neighbors. Three dimensional express cubes have slightly higher hop counts, but have a larger bisection bandwidth than similar fat trees.

Reference-contexts: express cube as a torus will increase the average length of wires, which potentially could limit the clock cycle rate. * The actual performance of each topology depends on the actual communication patterns being used. 6 Related work One paper concerned with the measurement of the performance of interconnection networks <ref> [Aga91] </ref> has a more detailed comparison of various n-ary k-cubes. The papers that first introduce the two topologies [Dal91] [Lei85] discuss some performance measurements for each type of network, and we used some of those results in our work.
