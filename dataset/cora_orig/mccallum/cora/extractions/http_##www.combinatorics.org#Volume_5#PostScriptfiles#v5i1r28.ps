Abstract: The Alon-Tarsi conjecture states that for even n, the number of even latin squares of order n differs from the number of odd latin squares of order n. Zappa [6] found a generalization of this conjecture which makes sense for odd orders. In this note we prove this extended Alon-Tarsi conjecture for prime orders p. By results of Drisko [2] and Zappa [6], this implies that both conjectures are true for any n of the form 2 r p with p prime.

Reference-contexts: If n 6= 1 is odd, then switching two rows of a latin square alters its sign, so els (n) = ols (n). On the other hand, Alon and Tarsi <ref> [1] </ref> conjectured: Conjecture 1 (Alon-Tarsi) If n is even then els (n) 6= ols (n). Equivalently, the sum of the signs of all L 2 LS (n) is nonzero. This conjecture is related to several other conjectures in combinatorics and linear algebra [3, 5].
