Abstract: The paper presents a simple way of making your computer learn. Described learning is based on knowledge induction from examples, where entropy measure is used to guide the generalization process. The process is illustrated with the simple algorithm implemented in Logo, to help students to understand it and experiment by means of computer program. Implemented algorithm is one of the simple, well known machine learning algorithms from which some powerful algorithms have been developed and later successfully applied on many real-world problems, to induce knowledge about some real situation. One of the widely known real-world application is in medical diagnosis where machine learning system is used to predict a patient diagnosis from the symptoms.

Reference-contexts: Such induction process can be used as the basis for programming the computer to induce knowledge. The idea of knowledge induction from examples is used in the machine learning <ref> [1] </ref>, area of the computer science field called artificial intelligence. Section 2 briefly describes the idea of learning from examples. Section 3 introduces implemented machine learning algorithm. The Logo program is illustrated and discussed in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: The entropy and informativity of attribute outlook are then calculated: Entropy (outlook) = 5 14 fl 0:971 + 4 14 fl 0:971 = 0:694; Inf ormativity (Attribute) = 0:940 Entropy (outlook) = 0:246 4 Description of the Logo implementation Described machine learning algorithm is written in LogoS ([2], <ref> [3] </ref>), but can be easily adapted for any other Logo interpreter. Program consists of three main parts; the first reading domain (description of attributes and classes, and set of examples), the second generating decision tree and the third writing decision tree.

Reference-contexts: To each example, a value called class is assigned (e.g. prediction of the next-day weather). The problem is to induce knowledge describing value of the class by means of the attribute values. To illustrate the way of knowledge induction with computer, one of the simple machine learning algorithms ID3 <ref> [4] </ref> has been implemented in Logo. The algorithm belongs to the family of machine learning algorithms called Top Down Induction of Decision Trees. The main characteristic of these algorithms is that knowledge induction is performed using top-down approach and is represented by means of decision tree. <p> To describe learning from examples as performed by ID3 algorithm a simple `Saturday morning' <ref> [4] </ref> domain is used. In this machine learning domain, 14 training examples are given (see Table 1). <p> Windy is no leads to the most right leaf labelled with the class yes. Now we can conclude that today's weather is suitable (without knowing values of attributes temperature and humidity). 3 Algorithm used for knowledge induction Machine learning algorithm ID3 <ref> [4] </ref> induces knowledge from examples and represents it in the form of decision tree (see Sec. 2).
