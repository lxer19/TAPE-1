Abstract: 6.837 Final Project Report Abstract Image synthesis is in general a sampling process. During the process of raytracing we are converting a scene which is analog in nature to a discrete image which consists of pixels with integer values. Therefore we should expect some aliasing effects due to undersampling to occur. This project reviews some antialising techniques, such as jittering, gloss, translucency, and depth of field. The basic idea behind all the methods is that, in contrast with aliasing, chaos is tolerated by the human eye. We are trying to increase realism in raytracing by introducing randomness.
