Abstract: A wavelet based model for propagation of optical pulses in nonlinear media is presented. We obtain an O(N) algorithm for linear propagation by replacing the wavelet-domain propagation operator by its Taylor series approximation. Nonlinear propagation is then achieved by adding the nonlinear term in mid-step in a method analogous to the split-step Fourier method. Using wavelets offers the advantage of O(N ) computational complexity compared with O(N log N ) for Fast Fourier Transform methods. Using a wavelet basis also leads naturally to the time-resolved spectrum of the signal. Another advantage is that the local properties of wavelets will allow locally adaptive algorithms to be implemented.

Reference-contexts: These effects and their interplay are described by the Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE). Analytic solution of this equation is not possible and recourse must be made to numerical methods, of which the split-step Fourier method <ref> [1] </ref> predominates. This paper describes a split-step wavelet method for solving the NLSE. Instead of expressing the propagating signal as a sum of Fourier components, we expand the signal on a wavelet basis, using orthogonal Daubechies wavelets. Choosing a wavelet basis provides several advantages. <p> In practice, propagation by one z-step of length h is then done by: A (z + h; T ) = exp h ^ D exp z ) 2 This is a symmetrised split-step method, with the nonlinear term lumped at the centre to reduce the error in commuting the operators <ref> [1] </ref>. The Fourier and wavelet methods evaluate the nonlinear term in the same way. It is in the treatment of the linear dispersive operator ^ D, that the wavelet method offers significant potential advantage and this aspect will be the focus of the following sections. 2.2. <p> Linear Propagation In figure 1 we present the power profile of an unchirped Gaussian pulse, propagated a distance of L D in dispersive fibre. The dispersion length L D is a measure of fibre distance over which dispersion is significant <ref> [1] </ref>, and is given by L D = T 2 0 =jfi 2 j, where T 0 is the width of the pulse. In this case T 0 = 0:2ns, fi 2 = 20ps 2 km 1 , and the input signal peak power was 1mW . <p> We can see that the Fourier and Wavelet results agree very closely. This result also agrees very well with the analytic solution for linearly propagated Gaussians <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.2. Nonlinear Propagation with fi 2 = 20ps 2 km 1 , and SPM coefficient fl = 2:59W 1 km 1 . Agreement with the split-step Fourier method is again seen to be close. 4.

Reference-contexts: Thirdly, it is possible to represent signals on an interval with wavelets thereby eliminating the periodicity imposed by Fourier methods. Finally, many operators on wavelet bases are sparse <ref> [2] </ref>, or can be well approximated by sparse operators so that the application of these operators in the wavelet domain should not be onerous. It must be balanced, however, by the fact that Fourier based methods benefit from derivative operators which are diagonal.

Reference-contexts: It must be balanced, however, by the fact that Fourier based methods benefit from derivative operators which are diagonal. Previous work <ref> [3] </ref> sought to express signals as an expansion in terms of non-orthogonal Mexican-Hat wavelets. An analytic solution was derived for linear propagation of these wavelets, and the propagated pulse was obtained by reconstructing the signal in terms of the propagated wavelets.

Reference-contexts: An analytic solution was derived for linear propagation of these wavelets, and the propagated pulse was obtained by reconstructing the signal in terms of the propagated wavelets. The nonlinear term was added at mid-step in the same way as in the split-step Fourier method. Other authors, particularly Gagnon <ref> [4] </ref>, expand the signal in terms of scaling function coefficients. In this paper, linear propagation is carried out in the wavelet-transform domain, with the non-linear term being incorporated in the scaling function domain. 2. METHOD 2.1. <p> This gives information that is valuable for a qualitative assessment of the performance of an optical fibre link. Thirdly, the wavelet representation allows both global and local adaptivity in the representation of signals. Globally adaptive grid size control <ref> [4] </ref> is possible since scaling functions have interpolation properties: we can go from V n to V n+1 by setting W n = 0 and employing the inverse wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: (t) = k=0 where the coefficients -n;k are given by: -n;k = 2 n=2 1 This integral is approximated by a quadrature formula: -n;k = c=0 in which the weights fw c g are solutions to a system of linear equations in terms of the moments of the scaling function <ref> [5] </ref> which ensures that polynomials up to degree L 1 are integrated exactly. L depends on the support of the scaling function and is the number of equally spaced samples of f (t) that fit inside the support of ' n (t). <p> Now we have the wavelet transform of the linearly propagated signal. All that remains is the addition of the non-linear term. This is more easily performed on the scaling function representation which approximates the time domain samples with third order accuracy <ref> [5] </ref> for Daubechies wavelets of order greater than 2. An inverse wavelet transform of the linearly propagated signal is performed, followed by the addition of the nonlinear term. A second linear propagation operation completes one z-step. This is repeated until the whole fibre length has been covered.

Reference-contexts: Now we can write a wavelet version of the linear part of equation (1): W fA (z + h; T )g = exp (hW f ^ Dg) W fA (z; T )g (8) where W fg denotes the wavelet transform. Beylkin <ref> [6] </ref> gives a method for calculating W f ^ Dg, a block banded diagonal matrix. For a fixed operator ^ D (i.e. a particular type of optical fibre) this calculation need only be performed once for a given step-size h.

RESULTS Here we present results for our split-step wavelet method for linear pulse propagation in optical fibre. In each case we compare our results with Fourier transform methods. 3.1.
