Title: IMPROVING PERFORMANCE ON SWITCHBOARD BY COMBINING HYBRID HME/HMM AND MIXTURE OF GAUSSIANS ACOUSTIC MODELS

Abstract: This paper presents results of our efforts on combining standard mixture of Gaussians acoustic modeling [10] with a context-dependent hybrid connectionist HME/HMM architecture [3, 4] for the Switchboard corpus. Using a score normalization scheme which is independent of the stream's modeling paradigm and adaptive methods for combining multiple probability distributions, we achieve a relative decrease in word error rate of 3.5% and 9.3%, compared to each of the single stream systems. As opposed to multiple acoustic streams based on mixture of Gaussians, the integration of hybrid NN/HMM based modeling appears to be advantageous since the differences in modeling techniques and training algorithms allow to capture different aspects of the speech signal. Small dependence among emission probability estimates is considered essential for potential gains in interpolated systems.

Reference-contexts: Clustering of the polyphonic decision tree uses an entropy based splitting criterion and is carried out in a two pass procedure, where codebooks are clustered in an initial step, followed by the clustering of a larger number of distributions which are sharing codebooks <ref> [1] </ref>. The system used for the experiments reported here consists of 24k distributions and 6k codebooks, each containing 16 diagonal-covariance Gaussians. * Adaptation: The system uses MLLR based unsupervised adaptation on confidence measure weighted first hypotheses generated by the baseline system.

Reference-contexts: The hybrid HME/HMM system uses the same preprocessing as the MOG system but concatenates 7 adjacent MFCC's to obtain its final feature vector instead of applying an LDA transform. A more detailed description of the recognition engine (decoder,lexicon,LM) can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The following table summarizes results obtained by applying some of the stream combination methods described earlier. The first two rows, termed MOG and HME list the word error rates for the stand-alone systems. The next three rows contain results for combined systems.

Reference-contexts: In our experiments we are therefore applying a score normalization technique, before combining multiple acoustic streams. Viewing streams based on different modeling paradigms as experts for acoustic observations, we can introduce a gating mechanism similar to the one used in HME's or in the Meta-Pi <ref> [5] </ref> architecture, to merge the outputs of such experts. A major difficulty of this technique, known in statistics as linear opinion pooling [6], is the need for relatively independent expert opinions. We are trying to address this issue by combining heterogenous systems.

Reference-contexts: A major difficulty of this technique, known in statistics as linear opinion pooling <ref> [6] </ref>, is the need for relatively independent expert opinions. We are trying to address this issue by combining heterogenous systems. However, independence of observation probability estimates can not be expected since the systems are trained on the same data.

Jordan and Jacobs <ref> [7] </ref> introduced the hierarchical mixtures of experts for solving non-linear regression problems emphasizing the divide-and-conquer strategy. In our system, HME's are used as classifiers which requires different expert parameterizations. In an HME, the learning task is divided into sets of overlapping regions by a tree-organized hierarchy of gating networks. <p> For classification, expert and gating networks in an HME model multinomial probabilities and are therefore parameterized using the softmax nonlinearity ('canonical link' in GLIM theory): z i (x) = P In <ref> [7] </ref> the y i (x) are parameterized as linear models, leading to an efficient EM training algorithm (iteratively re-weighted weighted least squares) for the hierarchy. However, we discovered that it is sometimes advantageous to use more complex parameterizations for gates and experts.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Recognizing spontaneous conversational telephone speech is one of the most challenging fields being tackled by the speech recognition community. Sites achieved word error rates ranging from 38.8% to 47.1% (Switchboard 1996, <ref> [8] </ref>) and from 44.9% to 51.6% (Switchboard + CallHome 1997) in NIST's recent Hub-5E LVCSR evaluations based on the Switchboard and CallHome spontaneous telephone speech corpora. These figures compare to only 7-10% error rates achievable on high-quality read speech (e.g. on the Wall Street Journal domain). <p> This algorithm adapts the number of MLLR transformations to the amount of adaptation data available [10]. This recognizer was one of the best performing systems participating in the Hub-5E 1996 and 1997 evaluations <ref> [8] </ref>. Since at the time of the experiments for this paper, adaptation was not available for the hybrid HME/HMM system, we were not using MLLR for the mixture of Gaus-sians system either. 3.

Reference-contexts: The above technique can be enhanced by allowing different acoustic models to have different interpolation weights. This, however, requires a learning algorithm to adjust these parameters in order to maximize an objective function such as the likelihood of the combined system. Work by other people (e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>) has shown that the estimation of model-dependent interpolation weights requires a discriminative training procedure which can become computationally prohibitive.

Reference-contexts: Lots of spontaneous speech phenomena such as false-starts and interjections can be observed in the Switchboard and Call-Home corpora. Our recognizer for the Switchboard domain is based on the Janus Recognition Toolkit (JRTk) <ref> [10] </ref>. We recently extended the acoustic modeling techniques available in JRTk by integrating a context-dependent hybrid neural network/HMM system [3, 4]. The hybrid is based on generalized Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) [7, 3] which are used as statistical estimators of HMM observation probabilities. <p> The number of MLLR transformations actually used to adapt to a specific speaker is determined automatically using a clustering algorithm on the pooled set of Gaussians. This algorithm adapts the number of MLLR transformations to the amount of adaptation data available <ref> [10] </ref>. This recognizer was one of the best performing systems participating in the Hub-5E 1996 and 1997 evaluations [8].

Reference-contexts: Using polyphonic decision trees and a factorization technique for posterior probabilities, acoustic contexts can be modeled accurately within the NN/HMM framework. Using this technology, the HME/HMM system has recently become competitive with systems based on mixture of Gaussians acoustic models. Work by other groups (e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>) has shown that combina tions of different architectures for acoustic modeling can improve the overall performance, even in the case when only static linear interpolation with constant weighting factors is applied.
