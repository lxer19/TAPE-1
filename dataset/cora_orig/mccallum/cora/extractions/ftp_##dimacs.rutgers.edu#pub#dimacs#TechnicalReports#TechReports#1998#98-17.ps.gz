Reference-contexts: The algorithm can be implemented to run online in a distributed manner at each node. Reusing channels beyond a given distance is an idealization of interference constraints. A more refined model <ref> [2] </ref> prescribes a minimum separation between channels assigned to two cells, where the - 9 - separation is a non-increasing function of the distance between the cells. An interesting open question is to design protocols that provide guaranteed performance ratios in the context of such a separation constraint model.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is unlikely that any computationally feasible protocol, whether o*ine or online, can be shown to be perfectly optimal. For reuse distance 2, protocols that achieve guaranteed performance were first described by Janssen et.al <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. More recently, algorithms with a performance ratio of 4=3 have been described both in the o*ine [9, 10] as well as the online setting [5]; it is conjectured that this bound is optimal. In the present paper, we consider a more constrained model, viz. with reuse distance 3.

Reference-contexts: Cellular networks are often modeled by dividing the planar calling area into mutually disjoint but identical hexagonal cells that cover the entire area <ref> [8] </ref>. Two cells are adjacent if they share a common boundary edge in this hexagonal tiling of the plane. In general, the distance between two cells is the smallest number of boundary edges crossed going from one cell to the other.

Reference-contexts: Many other proposed heuristics (see, e.g., [1, 6, 7, 11, 12]) claim to achieve better performance in practice, but have no proven bounds on their ratio of optimality. Indeed, it was only recently shown <ref> [9] </ref> that even when the reuse distance is limited to 2 and the number of calls requiring service is known a priori, it is NP-hard to determine the optimal number of required channels. <p> For reuse distance 2, protocols that achieve guaranteed performance were first described by Janssen et.al [3, 4]. More recently, algorithms with a performance ratio of 4=3 have been described both in the o*ine <ref> [9, 10] </ref> as well as the online setting [5]; it is conjectured that this bound is optimal. In the present paper, we consider a more constrained model, viz. with reuse distance 3. For this model, we describe a simple algorithm that has a guaranteed performance ratio of 7=3. <p> Let (H) denote the weighted chromatic number of H, i.e. the minimum number of colors needed to color H so that conditions (a) and (b) above are satisfied. It is straightforward to extend the NP-hardness result for computing the chromatic number of triangle graphs <ref> [9] </ref> to square graphs as well. Hence, the best that one can do is to devise some M -optimal protocol for coloring square graphs, where M is a small constant.
