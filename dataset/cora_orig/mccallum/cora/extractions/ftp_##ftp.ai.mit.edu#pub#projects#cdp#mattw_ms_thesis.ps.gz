Abstract: This thesis presents the design, construction, control and evaluation of a novel force controlled actuator. Traditional force controlled actuators are designed from the premise that "Stiffer is better". This approach gives a high bandwidth system, prone to problems of contact instability, noise, and low power density. The actuator presented in this thesis is designed from the premise that "Stiffness isn't everything". The actuator, which incorporates a series elastic element, trades off achievable bandwidth for gains in stable, low noise force control, and protection against shock loads. This thesis reviews related work in robot force control, presents theoretical descriptions of the control and expected performance from a series elastic actuator, and describes the design of a test actuator constructed to gather performance data. Finally the performance of the system is evaluated by comparing the performance data to theoretical predictions. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of closing torque control loops around the joints is that the system is likely to be more stable. As the torques are being controlled, the effects 19 20 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE SURVEY of friction, torque ripple, etc are reduced. An <ref> [1] </ref> suggested a combination of end point and joint force sensing, closing joint torque control loops to obtain stability, and using a wrist sensor to obtain good steady state force accuracy. In different research Eppinger and Seering [14] [15] investigated the bandwidth limits on robot force control. <p> This can result as the robot changes from position control, when it is moving freely, to force control when in contact with the environment. In addition the force control itself can exhibit instability. The force control problem has been related to a high gain position control (An <ref> [1] </ref>). The model of the manipulator and the environment is generally considered as a fourth order system which is very lightly damped, the natural frequency being related to the mass of the robot and the stiffness of the environment (Eppinger and Seering [15], An [2]).

Reference-contexts: The model of the manipulator and the environment is generally considered as a fourth order system which is very lightly damped, the natural frequency being related to the mass of the robot and the stiffness of the environment (Eppinger and Seering [15], An <ref> [2] </ref>). The system performance improves if the effective stiffness of the environment is reduced, for example by covering the endpoint of the manipulator with a compliant covering (Roberts [26] and Whitney [39]), or alternatively by increasing the damping on the system. <p> Figure 6-11 shows the response to a square wave in commanded torque. The response for the soft surface is slightly less damped than for the hard one, but neither exhibits the instability common in this type of test (see An <ref> [2] </ref>). Figure 6-12 shows a similar test where the torque is commanded to follow a sine wave command. Again the performance is good in both cases. Figure 6-13 shows the force control performance at following a sine wave command when the output shaft of the actuator is also being moved.

Reference-contexts: Harmonic drive gearboxes offer a significant improvement in backlash, but they have high friction, and non-linear stiffness effects (Tuttle [35]). The disadvantages of gears have lead some authors to use direct drive motors (Asada <ref> [3] </ref>). Salisbury [29] and Townsend [34] have had considerable success using cable transmissions, which have the advantage of not having any backlash, and reduced friction. 22 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: Robot structures will always have some compliance, due to the size and weight of the links, and perhaps also due to the introduction of compliant force sensors. Work has been done on controlling the position of structures with flexibility (Cannon [9], and a review is in Balas <ref> [4] </ref>), and the position control of manipulators with flexibility at the joints (Spong [31], Lee et al [21], Chen [10]). In recent years more work has been done on actually putting compliance into the manipulator, achieving a similar purpose to the compliant coverings mentioned 21 above.

Reference-contexts: The 68332 is used for higher level processing. It communicates with the motor board at up to 400Hz, sending gains and set-points for the control loop, and receiving data. The processor runs L, a subset of Common Lisp, written by Rodney Brooks at MIT <ref> [6] </ref>. The front end of the 68332 is a Macintosh PC, where the data from the actuator can be displayed and analysed. 56 CHAPTER 5. ACTUATOR DESIGN 5.7 Control The control loop implemented on the 6811 is similar to that detailed in Chapter 3.

Reference-contexts: In other applications, it may well become significant. Chapter 5 Actuator Design 5.1 Introduction This chapter describes the build of a series elastic actuator. The specification for the actuator was determined by its eventual application as part of the arm for the humanoid robot Cog <ref> [7] </ref>. This application is described in Chapter 7. Figure 5-1 shows a photograph of the final actuator design. It consists of an electric motor and a spring instrumented with strain gauges. The actuator has a maximum output torque of 4Nm. <p> The actuator behaves well at low frequencies, and the spring like behaviour is very clear at high frequencies. Chapter 7 Applications 7.1 Cog Series elastic actuators similar to that described in this thesis are being used for the arms of the humanoid robot Cog <ref> [7] </ref>. The robot will interact with humans and perform human-like tasks, so it is important that its arms are safe.

Reference-contexts: The question as to where the force should be sensed, whether at the joints or at the end effector, has been addressed by a number of authors. Cannon <ref> [8] </ref> was the first to investigate non-colocated sensors (where the sensor is not located at the actuator to be controlled). Cannon showed that colocation allows good stable control, while any significant dynamics between the sensor and the actuator can lead to instability. <p> In different research Eppinger and Seering [14] [15] investigated the bandwidth limits on robot force control. They found that the fundamental limit on the force control bandwidth is the link stiffness. Like Cannon <ref> [8] </ref> they found that non-colocated dynamics can lead to unstable systems. They also considered the effects of simple force control laws on a model of an actuator and the environment.

Reference-contexts: Robot structures will always have some compliance, due to the size and weight of the links, and perhaps also due to the introduction of compliant force sensors. Work has been done on controlling the position of structures with flexibility (Cannon <ref> [9] </ref>, and a review is in Balas [4]), and the position control of manipulators with flexibility at the joints (Spong [31], Lee et al [21], Chen [10]).

In recent years more work has been done on actually putting compliance into the manipulator, achieving a similar purpose to the compliant coverings mentioned 21 above. Xu et al, [43] used a six degree of freedom wrist with a passive compliance and an active sensing mechanism.

Reference-contexts: This can happen if the collision occurs on an arm link which is not detected by the wrist force sensor. Impedance control (Hogan [17]) essentially gives the actuators a dynamic behaviour which is stable, and so unexpected collisions are dealt with more safely. Hogan [18] and Colgate <ref> [11] </ref> proved that for any system to stable with an arbitrary environment, then it must look like a passive system. Robot structures will always have some compliance, due to the size and weight of the links, and perhaps also due to the introduction of compliant force sensors. <p> It is important that the system is stable, and but perhaps more importantly, the system must be stable when in contact with all environments. 3.4.1 Impedance and Stability Colgate <ref> [11] </ref> and Hogan [18] have shown that the important measure for determining whether a system will be stable while in contact with an environment is the output impedance of the system.

Reference-contexts: There has also been work on the choice of actuation method (Hunter at al [19]). Electric motors have been the most common type, although pneumatic and hydraulic systems have also been used (examples are Raibert [24], Waldron [37], and Conrad <ref> [12] </ref>). Most electric motors have poor power density and can only obtain high power density by operating at high speed. To accelerate or move heavy loads, step down gearboxes are used, however these introduce friction, torque ripple, noise and backlash.

Reference-contexts: There are essentially two ways to do this|to provide active control of the forces, or to use a passive system such as Remote Centred Compliance (Drake <ref> [13] </ref>). The active methods have had been the focus of the bulk of robotic research in recent years. Whitney [38] gives a good review of force control methods.

Reference-contexts: The active methods have had been the focus of the bulk of robotic research in recent years. Whitney [38] gives a good review of force control methods. The methods described by Whitney are damping control (Whitney [39]), stiffness control (Salisbury [30]), impedance control (Hogan <ref> [17] </ref>) and hybrid position and force control (Raibert and Craig [25]). These methods differ in the way that they calculate the torques to be applied at each joint, with the goal of achieving a desired endpoint force. <p> This can happen if the collision occurs on an arm link which is not detected by the wrist force sensor.

Reference-contexts: However, unlike the work described in this thesis, the compliance is not controlled in these cases, position rather than force being controlled. Work on parallel elastic actuators is in progress by Morrell and Salisbury [23]. There has also been work on the choice of actuation method (Hunter at al <ref> [19] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: All of this suggests that the backlash is a contributory factor in the "pole" at 63 rad/sec. The backlash is like a dead band where the motor mass can accelerate without contacting the spring. It is possible that this non-linearity can lead to oscillation (see Khalil <ref> [20] </ref>), with a precise resonant frequency, dependent on the size of the nonlinearity, and the characteristics of the rest of the system.

Reference-contexts: Wu and Paul used joint torque control (Wu and Paul [41]), and argued that joint force control gave stability and high performance. Marth <ref> [22] </ref> used an event based system to detect contact and deal with it. These systems depend on a controller commanding the joint torques, depending on sensed values (such as whether there is contact), so their behaviour under unexpected collisions is not good.

This idea is currently being investigated at MIT by Salisbury and Morrell <ref> [23] </ref>. Another interesting idea is to use variable rate springs, where the changing stiffness alters the bandwidth of the force control as the load changes. This is being investigated by Salisbury at MIT.

Reference-contexts: They found that the fundamental limit on the force control bandwidth is the link stiffness. Like Cannon [8] they found that non-colocated dynamics can lead to unstable systems. They also considered the effects of simple force control laws on a model of an actuator and the environment. Volpi <ref> [36] </ref> has undertaken work to assess the performance of torque control schemes under a variety of simple controllers, using an experimentally determined transfer function. One problem with all these schemes is that they exhibit instability while contacting stiff environments. <p> Other methods for dealing with the contact instability have been through simple control laws (Volpi <ref> [36] </ref>, Yousef-Toumi [44]), or the use of nonlinear control (Xu et al. [42]) to alter the characteristics of the control system so that low gains are used when the force is moving towards the setpoint, and high when it is moving away.

Reference-contexts: There has also been work on the choice of actuation method (Hunter at al [19]). Electric motors have been the most common type, although pneumatic and hydraulic systems have also been used (examples are Raibert [24], Waldron <ref> [37] </ref>, and Conrad [12]). Most electric motors have poor power density and can only obtain high power density by operating at high speed. To accelerate or move heavy loads, step down gearboxes are used, however these introduce friction, torque ripple, noise and backlash.

Reference-contexts: There are essentially two ways to do this|to provide active control of the forces, or to use a passive system such as Remote Centred Compliance (Drake [13]). The active methods have had been the focus of the bulk of robotic research in recent years. Whitney <ref> [38] </ref> gives a good review of force control methods. The methods described by Whitney are damping control (Whitney [39]), stiffness control (Salisbury [30]), impedance control (Hogan [17]) and hybrid position and force control (Raibert and Craig [25]).

Reference-contexts: The active methods have had been the focus of the bulk of robotic research in recent years. Whitney [38] gives a good review of force control methods. The methods described by Whitney are damping control (Whitney <ref> [39] </ref>), stiffness control (Salisbury [30]), impedance control (Hogan [17]) and hybrid position and force control (Raibert and Craig [25]). These methods differ in the way that they calculate the torques to be applied at each joint, with the goal of achieving a desired endpoint force. <p> The system performance improves if the effective stiffness of the environment is reduced, for example by covering the endpoint of the manipulator with a compliant covering (Roberts [26] and Whitney <ref> [39] </ref>), or alternatively by increasing the damping on the system.

Reference-contexts: A hand is being built by another student (Yoky Matsuoka). The use of the spring does introduce complexity into the mechanical design, and for the wrist a cable transmission was used to tuck the motor out of the way of the hand. The arm is described more thoroughly in <ref> [40] </ref>. 7.2 Planetary rover It is also hoped to use the elastic actuators in an arm for a planetary explorer. The arm will be used to collect samples of rocks digging, collecting soil samples and other exploratory tasks.

Reference-contexts: Wu and Paul used joint torque control (Wu and Paul <ref> [41] </ref>), and argued that joint force control gave stability and high performance. Marth [22] used an event based system to detect contact and deal with it.

Reference-contexts: In recent years more work has been done on actually putting compliance into the manipulator, achieving a similar purpose to the compliant coverings mentioned 21 above. Xu et al, <ref> [43] </ref> used a six degree of freedom wrist with a passive compliance and an active sensing mechanism. Hashimoto [16] used an parallel compliant mechanism. Sugano [32] used a variable rate spring to adjust the compliance of his robot finger. This work allows the manipulator compliance to be altered.
