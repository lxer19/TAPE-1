Title: PLANNING-BASED INTEGRATED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS

Abstract: This paper describes a system that uses AI planning and representation techniques as the core of a decision support system. * The planning technology is supplemented with other AI and non-AI technologies. The overall system and initial application domain, military operations planning, are described first. We then describe the integration of SIPE-2, a generative planning system, with three independently-developed AI systems: a temporal reasoning engine, a case-based force selection module, a system for scheduling and capacity analysis.

Reference-contexts: Each of these sections includes a description of future work. Section 6 presents our conclusions. 2 BACKGROUND SOCAP was developed as part of an ongoing project to test the ability of AI planning systems to provide decision support for planning a course of action in response to a crisis <ref> [1] </ref>. Human planners find it difficult to keep track of the myriad details involved in a large operation with multiple plans generated at multiple distributed planning sites.

Reference-contexts: These critics proved useful as a modular way to add extensions to SIPE-2. SIPE-2 has been tested on a variety of small-scale problems for travel, robot, and aircraft planning, and for extended blocks-world problems. It has been applied to a larger scale planning problem in the brewery domain <ref> [4] </ref>. The performance of SIPE-2 in the domain described in this paper (military operations planning) is discussed in [5]. SOCAP, in its military operations planning mode, encodes knowledge derived from a scenario used at a military teaching college [6].

Reference-contexts: The performance of SIPE-2 in the domain described in this paper (military operations planning) is discussed in [5]. SOCAP, in its military operations planning mode, encodes knowledge derived from a scenario used at a military teaching college <ref> [6] </ref>. Its customized user interface guides a planner through the decision-making needed for producing plans and displays the results graphically as a network of actions or as icons on a color map.

Reference-contexts: This is limiting; for example, one cannot model when the various effects of an action become true during its execution, nor can one model actions that must occur simultaneously. We felt that Allens 13 temporal relations <ref> [7] </ref> would permit more versatile operations with explicit representation of actions starting or finishing at the same time, overlapping each other, or one occurring during another. Many dependencies between different military actions should be represented in this way in SOCAP.

Reference-contexts: We initially extended SOCAPs ability to represent and reason about time by adding a layer on top of SIPE-2 that would keep track of the temporal constraints within the plan, using the Tachyon temporal reasoning system <ref> [8] </ref> to maintain and propagate these constraints. The interface to Tachyon was designed to be general enough to permit a different temporal reasoner to be substituted (such as TMM [9]). We are now beginning to integrate the temporal reasoner more closely with SIPE-2, as described below.

Reference-contexts: Some of the difficulties in incorporating complete temporal reasoning capabilities into planning systems are discussed in <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 CASE-BASED REASONING Selecting the right force to participate in a military operation or tailoring a force to meet special requirements is an important part of operations planning.

Reference-contexts: Users expressed a desire to be able to modify the units in the list (e.g., its equipment list). This force selection and tailoring was seen as an area where case-based reasoning <ref> [11] </ref> would apply. We integrated a CBR system from GE-CRD called CAse-based Force Selection (CAFS) which was built on GEs CAse-based REasoning Tool (CARET).

Reference-contexts: Alterations to the resources *DITOPS is based on the Opportunistic Intelligent Scheduler (OPIS) scheduling technology developed at CMU <ref> [12] </ref>. 9 (e.g., a lift being unavailable for a specified time period) can also be included. This information is analyzed by DITOPS capacity analysis routines and the result is passed back to SOCAP in the form of absolute values for supply and demand of aggregate resources.
