Abstract: We study version selection schemes for hard real-time communications in multi-access networks. In many hard real-time systems a message may have several versions, e.g., a long version and a short version. The long version of a message contains complete information and is the preferred version to be transmitted. The short version contains less information and requires less time to be transmitted. Version selection schemes are responsible for determining which version of a message to transmit, and must make a tradeoff between information completeness and message loss. Two classes of version selection schemes are proposed in this paper: those that are based on message time constraints, and those that are based on the network traffic. We discuss the design and implementation of both classes of version selection schemes used in conjunction with a window based media access protocol. The simulation results show that as the network load increases, our version selection schemes are effective at reducing the message loss by trading off the proportion of long version messages sent.

Reference-contexts: In many applications, a trade-off can be made between information completeness and message loss <ref> [1, 2, 4, 13] </ref>. For these applications, a message may have several versions. Different versions take a different amount of time to be transmitted and carry a different amount of information. <p> In this paper, we address the design and implementation of version selection schemes that are responsible for making such decisions. Many researchers have investigated network communications in which each message has several versions. Bially et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have suggested such a system for the transmission of voice traffic. Each message in their system consists of several packets, generated from the same voice period but at different sampling rates.

The proposed version selection schemes are invoked whenever a node sends a message.

Reference-contexts: Messages are structured such that one or more packets may be discarded without affecting the continuity of the speech output, however the voice quality at the receiver degrades as more packets are discarded. Kim and Towsley <ref> [5] </ref> developed a similar message model for transmission of real-time messages in packet-switching multiplexers. In their system, if there are too many packets waiting to be transmitted, then only a fraction of the packets for each message are transmitted.

Reference-contexts: We show that version selection schemes can effectively reduce the message loss when used in conjunction with a window protocol in which the optimal transmission policy has been implemented. The work presented in this paper is related to the field of imprecise computation <ref> [8] </ref>. In imprecise computation, tasks may be interrupted before completion by the scheduler, but at the cost of delivering poorer quality results. The scheduler faces a tradeoff between result quality and computation time. Furthermore, the scheduler is centralized and task characteristics are known at scheduling time.

Scheme C has been evaluated via simulation, and found to be effective in trading off message loss with message quality <ref> [9] </ref>. Further, its performance can be adjusted by the user through the use of the parameter H. However, due to space limitations, these results will not be presented here.

Reference-contexts: System characteristics In this section an overview of the system under consideration is given, including the network and message models, characteristics of version selection schemes and the media access protocol used in this study. 2.1 The network model The results reported in this paper are for a multi-access (CSMA/CD) network <ref> [12] </ref>, because networks of this type are widely used for real-time communications. Nonetheless, version selection schemes in general can also be applied to other types of network, such as token ring networks [7, 14]. Nodes in a multi-access network communicate via a shared channel.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, this information is locally available on the node that sends out the message. Therefore this approach is independent of the media access protocol being used. In this paper, we relied on the window protocol in developing traffic based version selection schemes. In a previous paper <ref> [16] </ref>, we considered traffic based version selection schemes that can be used in conjunction with a virtual time CSMA protocol. Much related work remains to be done on our version selection schemes. They could be extended to operate in unslotted channels.
