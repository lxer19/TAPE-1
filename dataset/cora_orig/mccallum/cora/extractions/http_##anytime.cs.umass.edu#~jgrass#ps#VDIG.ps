Abstract: As the Internet continues to grow it enables computer systems to make complex decisions based entirely on the information gathered from different on-line resources. Unfortunately, retrieving information from sites on the Internet in order to make a decision is a time consuming and potentially expensive task. This paper presents a system designed to control the information gathering process so as to optimize the value of information to the user. The system uses a database describing the contents, costs, and responsiveness of different information sources, and a description of the user's decision model. By predicting the expected querying value for a set of sites, the Value-Driven Information Gathering (VDIG) system can determine an ordering for querying sites and monitor and alter the plan as it executes. Preliminary results show that significant gains in performance can be achieved by taking into account the time/cost/quality tradeoffs offered by the different information sources.

Reference-contexts: The question is how to control the information gathering process in a way that is sensitive to these characteristics. The value-directed information gathering algorithm presented in this paper shares many characteristics with anytime algorithms because of the ability to smoothly trade quality for execution time <ref> [ 1; 6; 5; 15 ] </ref> . The expected querying value for a set of sites is very similar to the performance profile that an anytime algorithms uses to calculate the optimal execution time (see figure 7).
