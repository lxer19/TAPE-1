Title: Abstract general, a document management infrastructure built around a multivalent perspective can provide an extensible,
Note: In  
Abstract: Digital documents have advanced only slightly from their non-digital ancestors, incorporating a few such innovations as hypertext links and full text searching. Even the much heralded advent of multimedia, just as embedded images and video clips, are rather straightforward digital analogs of books and film. We believe that computer technology makes possible far more interesting and complex digital documents, and propose a new general paradigm that regards complex documents as multivalent documents comprising multiple layers of distinct but intimately related content. Small, dynamically-loaded program objects, or behaviors, activate the content and work in concert with each other and layers of content to support arbitrarily specialized document types. Behaviors bind together the disparate pieces of a multivalent document to present the user with a single unified conceptual document. Examples of the diverse functionality in multivalent documents include: OCR select and paste, where the user describes a geometric region on the scanned image of a printed page and the corresponding text characters are copied out; video subtitling, which aligns a video clip with the script and language translations so that on the one hand the playing video can be presented simultaneously in multiple languages, and on the other hand the video can be searched with text-based techniques; geographic information system (GIS) visualizations that compose several types of data from multiple datasets; and distributed user annotations that augment and may transform the content of the conceptual document.

Reference-contexts: With the goal to make the digitized collection widely available, we deliver materials over the World Wide Web [3] as much as possible. Although Mosaic <ref> [1] </ref> and Netscape [16] are sufficient for simple viewing of simple media like images and text, full multivalent interaction requires a browser that can execute the program-objects, which in our case are written in Suns C++-like Java language [12].

Reference-contexts: This can be useful in correcting the results of the optical character recognition software. Good OCR software is approximately 98% correct. For extremely important documents care would be taken to correct this output by hand. But with the cost of OCR correction running two to five dollars per page <ref> [2] </ref>, it would not be cost effective to invest such effort for the great mass of scanned documents. Ideally, consumers of the documents should be able to vote on the importance of a correct textual transcription. In a multivalent representation they can. <p> As well, it maintains the representations distinctly (on disk) and as a (C++) object internally. RightPages is an example of a multivalent perspective but in the form of a custom system for a fixed and small number of layers. In order to edit scanned images of text, Image Emacs <ref> [2] </ref> constructs on the y a map of connected components that roughly corresponds to characterssidestepping the time and complexity of optical character recognitionand operates through this layer in reformatting characters as requested by editing commands.

Reference-contexts: In the multivalent approach, complexity is built up from simple content and most interesting behaviors operate on multiple layers of content and with other behaviors. 4.2 Active Documents Many systems activate the digital page with program script control, including Active Tioga Documents [24], Embedded Buttons <ref> [4] </ref> and Computational E-mail [6] to list but a few. In general these systems connect a script to a specific region of the document; in these regions the document is active, and elsewhere the document retains its ordinary properties.

Reference-contexts: Behaviors that introduce interaction modes would first be required to register the user interaction gestures in which they are interested, and only modes with disjoint sets of gestures would be allowed to coexist; enabling one automatically disables conicting behaviors. Alternatively, a Toolglass and Magic Lens <ref> [5] </ref> style of interaction would seem to complement a multivalent document approach perfectly. Toolglasses carry collections of Magic Lenses, and the user invokes a tool on a document by placing a lens over the affected area and operating through the lens.

Reference-contexts: Multivalent documents would provide the content and a set of tools; Toolglasses could organize them and a Magic Lenses would provide an excellent interaction paradigm. 4. Related Work 4.1 Compound Documents A comparison with compound document systems like OpenDoc [15] and Microsofts OLE <ref> [7] </ref> highlights the distinctive decomposition of the multivalent approach. In analogy to operating systems, the relationship between compound documents and multivalent documents parallels that between processes and threads. That is, compound documents organize multiple editors in the same document but at a much coarser level of granularity.

Reference-contexts: In the multivalent approach, active regions vary according to what behaviors are active, and the content of that region varies according to what semantic layers are available.

Reference-contexts: Adobes [25] supports textual attachments tied to a geometric position on the page, and annotations from several users can be combined into a composite page, but no attempt is made to adjust to a modified base document. More advanced annotation systems like CoNote <ref> [9] </ref> and ComMentor [21] tie textual annotations to particular locations in the text stream, compose annotations from multiple users, and the latter system is robust against changes to the original document. 5.

The basic document model of the HotJava browser mimics a compound document in that rectangular regions of the document controlled by dynamically-loaded program code; we are taking this browser as a base and modifying its source code to support the multivalent model.

Conclusions We have described a new model for digital documents called multivalent documents. It takes a fine-grained, object-oriented perspective on digital documents that is well suited to a networked world of rapidly evolving document technology.

Reference-contexts: Behaviors for a particular document are dynamically loaded over the network on demand. Behaviors are typed like classes and methods in an objected-oriented programming language, and a dynamically constructed type graph governs interaction between behaviors.

Issues 3.1 Misalignment of Layers The intimately related but decoupled nature of multivalent documents introduces a concern: a change to document could cause other layers to become misaligned.
