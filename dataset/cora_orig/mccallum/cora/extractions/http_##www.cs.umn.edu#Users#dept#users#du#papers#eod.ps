Abstract: It is generally recognized that the Internet can be used as a platform to deliver distance education services and that Internet information systems can be leveraged to enhance education. The Internet provides shared access to resources and media-rich material to augment traditional instruction. Much of the current educational use of Internet information systems is for publishing collections of documents and for providing hypermedia links to other information. However, menu-based hypermedia systems (Gopher) or document-based hypermedia (WWW) do not address the need for video-based hypermedia as a method for delivering annotated presentations and lectures.

Reference-contexts: Objective Many people have limited access to the traditional classroom setting due to various constraints, such as, time, distance, physical disabilities, transportation limitations and expenses, or non-school commitments (e.g. children at home, job) <ref> [1] </ref>. Education-on-demand (EOD) system provides distance learning opportunities for continuing education. Even for traditional full-time students, distance learning can provide attractive options with great flexibility. A core problem in providing distance learning service is the production and integration of the course materials. This process is very time-consuming.

Reference-contexts: The Gopher system can be thought of as a hypermedia menuing system where items in Gopher menus are links to objects distributed across servers on the Internet <ref> [2] </ref>. WWW popularized a form of hypermedia in which documents contain links to other documents residing on distributed servers [3]. Other forms of hypermedia, such as 3D virtual reality with embedded links to Internet resources are being developed [4].

Reference-contexts: To access networked video streams, the NHQT software has a video stream software module to retrieve data from a video server through the Internet or an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) <ref> [5] </ref> testbed network. The video server is designed to support a continuous media stream delivery according to the requests of the client software module. One objective of this implementation is to support delivery for long lectures without requiring excessive disk space on the client.

Reference-contexts: Hypermedia System Besides the two popular hypermedia-based systems, Internet Gopher and WWW, there are several different sophisticated hypermedia models, e.g., Hyper-G <ref> [6] </ref> (named after HyperWave as a commercial product) developed by Graz University of Technology. The main features of the Hyper-G are bidirectional hyperlink and referential integrity maintained by cooperating Hyper-G servers. Film player, audio player, text viewer, image viewer, etc. are separate media displayers.

Reference-contexts: Anchor authoring is done with authoring function associated with individual media displayer. There's no notion of time-line based synchronization between any two media objects like NHQT. The Amsterdam hypermedia model tries to give a framework suitable for describing hypermedia in general <ref> [7] </ref>. Dartmouth College has published multimedia proceedings on CD-ROM [8]. They produced hypermedia materials and mainly used synchronized slides and audio with a looped short video clip to replay the presentation in a conference. All of the above have complicated authoring process to achieve synchronized media production.

Reference-contexts: The authoring is much easier and can 4 especially cope with the Internet objects. There are some other hypermedia systems for specific purposes, such as the navigation in movie-only hypermedia <ref> [9] </ref>. This work provided a tool to traverse linked movies like a tour. NHQT basically links the static documents, and is also able to use hyperlinks pointing to other movies. Hjelsvold [10] has created video archive tools including a video annotator which can store video annotation as meta-data.

Reference-contexts: Networked Streaming Video Networked streaming video is more and more popular over the Internet and has been explored in a great deal. Many players for streaming video can be freely downloaded from some companies, such as InterVU, Xing Technology, VDOnet, Vivo Software, etc <ref> [11] </ref>. Some of these companies provide video servers running their own network protocols. Others can just ask Web server to deliver video using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Vosaic [12] derived from NCSA Mosaic incorporates real time video and audio into standard Web pages.
