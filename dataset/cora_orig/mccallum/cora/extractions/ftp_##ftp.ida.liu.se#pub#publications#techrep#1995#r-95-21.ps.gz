Abstract: IDA Technical Report 1995 LiTH-IDA-R-95-21 ISSN-0281-4250 Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, S-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden Reasoning about actions and Abstract The systematic approach to nonmonotonic logics of actions and change attempts to identify, for each proposed logic, what is its range of applicability relative to a precise definition of intended models. The article describes the concepts and methods that are used in this approach, and examples of assessed range of applicability for a few of the previously proposed logics in the case of strict inertia. The article also presents some new results, where the same systematic approach is applied to the case of chronicles with inertia and ramification. change with ramification

Reference-contexts: those where W (E; r) is a singleton for each combination of E and r, are m-compatible for arbitrary t m . 12 4.2 Prototypical Chronological Minimization, PCM The method of prototypical chronological minimization (PCM) is a slightly corrected variant of an entailment method that was first proposed by Kautz <ref> [2] </ref> and Shoham [9].

Reference-contexts: One might think that minimization of changes in dependent features is harmless, since such features are typically completely determined by the values of other features. However, well-known scenario problems such as the Aunt Agatha Livin-groom [10] and the Double Switch scenarios <ref> [3] </ref> have shown that one may 19 obtain unintended tradeoffs between changes in remanent and in dependent features, thereby introducing unintended selected models. These two entailment methods give the same result for strictly deterministic actions.

Reference-contexts: additional occlusion predicate X (f; t), expressing that the value of the feature f may change during the timestep [t 1; t]. 1.3 Applications The research on logics for actions and change has its origin in artificial intelligence, where it is historically known under the name of the "frame problem" <ref> [4] </ref>. Two kinds of uses have been foreseen in A.I. One is for common-sense reasoning based, in particular, on information given in natural language.

Reference-contexts: One particular use of binary selection functions is for filtering, where the set of selected models for h 1 ; 2 i is Min (t; [[ 1 ]]) " [[ 2 ]]: 1.5 Entailment Methods and Range of Applicability In earlier publications <ref> [6, 5, 8] </ref>, I have argued that the appropriate question with respect to a method based on a non-monotonic logic is not "is it correct", but "what is its range of applicability". <p> The action laws need to be specified for arbitrary object domains, since they should be reusable in several chronicles, but reasoning about a particular chronicle is still essentially propositional. In <ref> [5] </ref> we have worked out the relatively straight-forward details of this generalization. From a formal point of view, action laws will be understood as definitions of abbreviations, and not as first-class logical formulae. <p> In either case the move is then returned to the ego. This definition of a world and of the ego-world game is a specialization, with a trivial reformulation, of how those concepts were defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Let a world W be given, and choose a corresponding world description hIA; Infl; Rtrajsi which conserves W . In <ref> [5] </ref> we defined, in syntactic terms, the transformation from such a world description to an equivalent world description of the form hIA; lawi, where law is a set of action laws as exemplified in section 1 here. <p> We say that hIA; lawi correctly characterizes a world W iff it is formed, in the way defined in <ref> [5] </ref>, from a world description that conserves W . 3.3 Summary of transformations The successive shifts of representation that were described above can be summarized as follows. 1. Start with a world W (E; r). 2. Select a suitable Infl function for W . 3. <p> We notice that if hIA; Infl; Rtrajsi is formed from and conserves W , then W is PCM-compatible iff Rtrajs is. The first and second requirements are ontological ones, in the sense that they are requirements on the world that is involved in the scenario. It was proved in <ref> [5] </ref> that these two requirements are not only sufficient but also necessary, in the sense that for any world W that does not satisfy both of these requirements, there exists some schedule using W for which PCM does not give the intended set of models. <p> = fhM; Hi j 9X [hM; H; Xi 2 W ]g: An entailment method hG; Si is then defined to be correct for a chronicle of the usual K-IA structure iff Ci (S ([[law [scd]]]; [[obs]])) = Mod (): The remaining technical details of this machinery can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Notice that action laws can only force X (f; u) to be true at certain points; they can not force it to be false at all other points. <p> It was proved in [6] that CMOC is correct for all equidurational chronicles, and that this requirement is not only sufficient but also necessary, in the same sense of necessary as for PCM. 15 5.3 Other Entailment Methods A number of other entailment methods have been assessed in <ref> [5] </ref>. Some of them involve pretransformations that are more complex than G seq ; others involve more complex preference relations. <p> The complete presentation of that framework can be obtained in the monograph <ref> [5] </ref>. The basic approach is presently being extended in a number of directions, allowing for concurrency, ramification, faulty observations, etc. There is also considerable work on implementation methods for some of the assessed entailment methods. The present paper has only showed current work in one direction, namely for ramification.

Reference-contexts: In rough terms, dependent features correspond to the "non-frame" features of Kartha and Lifschitz, and occluded features correspond to their "frame, released" features [1]. For a more precise comparison, and for a motivation for the use of these partitions, please refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. In the case of IA, we were able to replace a world W by a world description hIA; lawi that conserved W , and then use the world description as the basis for the logical treatment. <p> Neither one of MRC-conservativeness or MRCC-conservativeness subsumes the other, since it is easy to construct a world description that is MRC-conservative but not MRCC-conservative, and vice versa <ref> [7] </ref>. The case of strictly inert world descriptions can be obtained easily, by choosing Dep (E; r) = ? for all E and r, and R C = R . It is trivial that every strictly inert world description that conserves a world W is MRC-and MRCC-conservative for W . <p> From a practical point of view, however, one presumably wishes to keep Infl (E; r) as small as possible, in order to make the corresponding action law as compact as possible. In this context, it was demonstrated in <ref> [7] </ref> that for single-timestep actions, MRCC has an interesting monotonicity property: if hIAD; Infl; Rtrajs; R C ; Depi is an MRCC-conservative world description corresponding to a world W , Infl 0 satisfies Infl (E; r) Infl 0 (E; r) for all E and r, and Rtrajs 0 is formed from
