Reference-contexts: They are the ones defined in points (5) and (6) below. The formulas defined in (5) all involve some type of temporal operations on actions. The formulas defined in (6) define the classical deontic formulas as introduced by v.Wright in <ref> [Wri51, Aqv84] </ref>. We assume a fixed set Prop of atomic propositions and a set Act of action expressions. The set Form of formulas is then the smallest set closed under: (1). Prop Form (2).

Reference-contexts: The idea is that failure is avoided when possible, i.e. when there is a non-failing alternative. In <ref> [Bro86] </ref>, this is called angelic nondeterminism. We can define the semantic operators on D. For the parallel operator & we use a set-intersection * ", which is almost the same as the normal set-intersection.

Reference-contexts: We discuss the action sequence operator elsewhere [DM90, Dig92]. The semantics of action expressions is given in two stages. First we define an algebra of uninterpreted actions (called a uniform semantics elsewhere <ref> [dBKM+86] </ref>), which allow us to interpret equalities between between action expressions without taking their effect into account. In the algebraic semantics, each action expression will be interpreted as a choice over possible steps. <p> Definition 3 Let T be a set of steps then T ffi = &gt; &lt; T nf [ffi]g if 9S 2 T : S 6= [ffi] f [ffi]g otherwise The operator T ffi is closely related to what is called failure removal in <ref> [dBKM+86] </ref>. The idea is that failure is avoided when possible, i.e. when there is a non-failing alternative. In [Bro86], this is called angelic nondeterminism. We can define the semantic operators on D.

Reference-contexts: When a final judgement has been given and thus a commitment has been made there arises an obligation (for the public prosecutor) to fulfil the judgement. 2 In database systems the transaction concept is used to maintain the integrity of the database <ref> [Date95] </ref>. A transaction is a conceptually atomic state transition that, at any moment, either has occurred or has not yet occurred.

Reference-contexts: So, for example, a&b&c, for a; b; c 2 At, is an action term. For simplicity, we do not have a notion of sequences of actions in the action expressions in this paper. We discuss the action sequence operator elsewhere <ref> [DM90, Dig92] </ref>. The semantics of action expressions is given in two stages. First we define an algebra of uninterpreted actions (called a uniform semantics elsewhere [dBKM+86]), which allow us to interpret equalities between between action expressions without taking their effect into account.

Reference-contexts: For now we will assume this relation to be primitive. In section 5 we will show how it can be related to a deontic ordering on states as defined in <ref> [DMW94] </ref>. We now give the interpretation of formulas in Form in Kripke structures. <p> I.e. the ordering is total on every set of states that is reachable from one state by performing some action. Some ideas about how to define this ordering can been found in <ref> [DMW94] </ref>. The above restriction states that only deontically preferable action can be the actions that are intended to be done next. I.e. the restriction ensures us that the model will behave in a moral way. Of course, other types of restrictions can be given.

Reference-contexts: We will use this feature to define obligations on actions shortly. It should be noted that using the semantic definition of [any]OE we can express the usual temporal operators over static formulas as given in e.g. <ref> [Eme89] </ref>. Points (6), (7) and (8) define extra temporal operators reaching over action expressions! (6) and (7) are quite obvious. The definition of the semantics of I N T indicates that an action ff is intended to be performed (or preferred) whenever there is some way to perform ff.

Reference-contexts: To influence (in a deontic way) the course of events, ff must be committed to. The act of commitment has been discussed in the literature at various places already. Notably, in the theory of speech acts it is one of the basic communication types (see [Sea69, SV85]). In <ref> [LHM95] </ref> the commitment is related to a goal of an autonomous agent. In this paper we give the commitment a deontic connotation by defining the commitment to perform ff as a (meta-)action with the result that it is obligated to perform ff.

Reference-contexts: For an extensive account of the adequacy of these abbreviations we refer to <ref> [Mey88, Mey87, WWMD91] </ref>; here it suffices to note that e.g. the claim that it is forbidden to do the action denoted by ff is equated with the fact that the resulting state is not ideal (i.e. is in violation), because P REV (ff) holds in that state while P REV (ff)

Reference-contexts: This language is a variant of dynamic logic ([Har79]), and was first used for this purpose in <ref> [Mey88] </ref>. In the present paper we add a few new formulas to this language. They are the ones defined in points (5) and (6) below. The formulas defined in (5) all involve some type of temporal operations on actions. <p> We assume that there is a function ef f : A ! ( ! ), such that ef f (a) is a function from states to states. (For simplicity, we assume events to be deterministic. Elsewhere, we show how nondeterministic events can be incorporated <ref> [Mey88] </ref>.) Two actions are called compatible if their joint effect is independent from the order in which they occur. Definition 9 Let S = [a 1 ; :::; a n ] A be a step consisting of pairwise compatible events. <p> For an extensive account of the adequacy of these abbreviations we refer to <ref> [Mey88, Mey87, WWMD91] </ref>; here it suffices to note that e.g. the claim that it is forbidden to do the action denoted by ff is equated with the fact that the resulting state is not ideal (i.e. is in violation), because P REV (ff) holds in that state while P REV (ff)
