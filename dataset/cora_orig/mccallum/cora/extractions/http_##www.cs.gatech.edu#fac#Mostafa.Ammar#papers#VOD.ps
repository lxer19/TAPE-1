Abstract: In typical proposals for Video-On-Demand (VOD) systems, customers are serviced individually by allocating and dedicating a transmission channel and a set of server resources to each customer. This approach leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system. We consider a VOD system that uses multicast delivery to service multiple customers with a single set of resources. The use of multicast communication requires that part of the on-demand nature of the system be sacrificed to achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness. One drawback to using multicast communication is that it complicates the provision of interactive VCR-style functions. Interactivity can be provided by either increasing the complexity of the customer set-top box or by modifying the semantics of the interactive functions to make them easier to provide. We describe a framework and mechanisms by which such interactive functions can be incorporated into a multicast delivery VOD system. Through the use of simulation, we evaluate and compare the performance of a unicast VOD system and multicast VOD systems offering various levels of interactivity. fl A prototype Audio-on-Demand system incorporating the ideas in this paper and running in a Sun OS environment is available by contacting the authors.

Reference-contexts: Interactive VOD allows customers to interact with a movie being shown using VCR-style functions such as pause, rewind and fast-forward. The major challenge in providing VOD is handling the potentially enormous demand for audio and video in a real-time network with real-time interaction <ref> [1] </ref>. In typical VOD system architectures, the approach is to service customers individually by allocating and dedicating a transmission channel and a set of server resources to each customer. The problem with this approach is that it leads to an expensive- to-operate, non-scalable system. <p> In this paper we explore the tradeoffs inherent in the use of multicast delivery in an interactive VOD system. Our contributions include the development of specific mechanisms to (1) provide interactivity based on two previously proposed types of VCR-style functions <ref> [1, 3] </ref>; and (2) improve a server's ability to satisfy interactive requests by reserving emergency channels for high load periods. We also evaluate and compare the performance of several VOD systems showing the improved scalability properties associated with using multicast delivery. <p> The use of multicast delivery in the context of VOD systems has been the subject of more recent research. However, much of the research <ref> [1, 3] </ref> has not provided performance results based on either simulation or analysis. In addition to the work described in this paper (reported previously in conference publications on which this paper is based [8, 9]), related efforts include [10, 11].

Reference-contexts: The problem with this approach is that it leads to an expensive- to-operate, non-scalable system. Most VOD trials to-date have only been geared toward servicing a small population of customers (see for example <ref> [2] </ref>). In these systems, as the number of customer requests increases, the quality of service can only be maintained by significantly increasing server resources and network bandwidth. One of the best ways to improve system performance is to satisfy customer requests using delayed server response and multicast communication.

Reference-contexts: It may also be necessary to sacrifice some of the on-demand nature of the system. Systems in which some interactivity and part of the on-demand nature are sacrificed to achieve cost-effectiveness or other objectives are sometimes referred to as Near VOD systems <ref> [3] </ref>.

The model is based on two assumptions: 1. The number of requests that arrive during the six evening hours known as "prime time" will be significantly higher than any other time of the day <ref> [3] </ref>. During this period, the scalability of a system becomes critical. For this reason, our simulation only measures performance during these six hours. 2. The request rate is measured in terms of the total number of requests that arrive during the prime time hours.

Requests are not assigned priority, and no request is denied if resources exist to service it. Other scheduling disciplines are possible, and some have been investigated in <ref> [10] </ref>. Customers are informed through response messages whether their request is accepted or denied. All requests that arrive during the current slot are scheduled or rejected before the end of the slot. Figure 2 shows the flow of control messages between the server and set-top box. <p> For the fast-forward function, availability varies depending on the state of the buffer. Providing fast-forward in most cases will be extremely difficult. 6 Alternatively, and as suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>, the customer can be removed from the movie stream and allocated another channel when the resumption of the movie is desired. This may result in the customer having to wait until resources are available before the movie is resumed. 10 and an even more limited fast forward function.

In <ref> [11] </ref> sharing server resources is accomplished by allowing customers to "catch up" with other movie streams by adjusting the playout speed of certain movies. No interactive functions are considered.

Reference-contexts: The paper is concluded in section 7. 2 Video-on-Demand System Architecture The traditional commercial television cable network has a star-bus topology which supports a one- to-many broadcasting paradigm. Furthermore, the network supports the multiplexing of many channels simultaneously <ref> [12] </ref>. Since the signal received by the customer is a combination of many channels, the customer must use a tuner to select the desired channel. Even with vast improvements in technology, the architecture of the traditional television broadcast network should remain essentially the same [13].
