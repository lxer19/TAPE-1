Abstract: 3dm is a three dimensional (3D) surface modeling program that draws techniques of model manipulation from both CAD and drawing programs and applies them to modeling in an intuitive way. 3dm uses a head-mounted display (HMD) to simplify the problem of 3D model manipulation and understanding. A HMD places the user in the modeling space, making three dimensional relationships more understandable. As a result, 3dm is easy to learn how to use and encourages experimentation with model shapes.

Previous uses of HMD systems have concentrated more on exploration of virtual worlds rather than creating or modifying them. Some examples of this work with HMD's can be found in [5].

Reference-contexts: Previous uses of HMD systems have concentrated more on exploration of virtual worlds rather than creating or modifying them. Some examples of this work with HMD's can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Modeling using a HMD system has been explored by Clark.[4] Users of Clarks system created parametric surfaces by manipulating control points on a wire-frame grid. This system highlighted the utility of using a HMD for improved understanding and interaction with models.
