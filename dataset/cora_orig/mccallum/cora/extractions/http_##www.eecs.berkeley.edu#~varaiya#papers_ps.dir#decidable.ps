Abstract: Hybrid systems combine differential equations with discrete event systems. We consider the reachability problem: is there a trajectory from an initial state to a target state in the hybrid system. We show that for hybrid systems with decoupled differential inclusions, the reachability problem can be decided in a finite number of steps.

The jump relation either leaves the value of the clock unchanged, or sets the clock nondeterministically to a value in an interval. Figure 4 is an example of a timed automaton.

Consider a timed automaton T = (L; E) with state space Q T .
