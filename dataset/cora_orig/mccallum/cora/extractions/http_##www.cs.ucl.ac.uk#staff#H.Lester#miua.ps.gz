Abstract: In this paper we discuss the use of thin-plate splines to improve the performance of the fluid algorithm for non-linear registration. It is found that the fluid algorithm gives a good registration at the expense of spatial blurring. By applying thin-plate splines to landmarks created automatically within the fluid algorithm, an improved performance is achieved.

Reference-contexts: We have found on test MRI data that regridding is necessary many times during the progress of the deformation, resulting in mixing of pixel intensities and a blurred final deformed source.

Bicubic interpolation [7] improved the quality of the output image but significant blur still remained. When the interpolation occurs across intensity edges, mixed intensities are created.
