Abstract: A method is presented for autonomous kinematic calibration of a 3-DOF redundant parallel robot. Multiple closed loops are used in a least squares optimization method. Ill-conditioning, column scaling of the gradient matrix, and observability indices for the best pose set of robot calibration configurations are discussed. Experimental results are presented and compared with the results using an external calibration device.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, it has been shown that single-loop closed chains can be kinematically calibrated using joint angle readings alone <ref> [1] </ref>. By placement of the closed chain into a number of configurations, consistency conditions permit the kinematic parameters to be extracted. Autonomous calibration is particularly useful for a number of reasons, nominal accuracy being only one of them. <p> Note that because some parameters such as k 3 are known, there is no need to assume a parameter as a reference unit and find other parameters relative to it <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> This closed-loop procedure requires only the joint displacement sensing, and hence is a viable option for field calibration where end-point measurement is not feasible. This procedure is an extension of an approach initially formulated for single closed kinematic loops <ref> [1] </ref> to multiple closed loop mechanisms. Results of simulations and experiments show that the allowable condition number depends on the measurement noise, computer precision, and our desired accuracy. It seemed that condition numbers of up to 1000 are acceptable in the present case.

Reference-contexts: In [15] and <ref> [2] </ref>, issues such as scaling, condition number, and the best pose set of the robot for data acquisition in calibration measurement have been discussed. Scaling is a way to obtain better numerical performance. <p> The singular value decomposition yields: f = gx = UV T x (9) where U and V are orthonormal matrices and is a 4m by n matrix which is made up of singular values of g in its main diagonal and zero other elements. It can be shown that <ref> [2] </ref>: L j x j where L is the smallest singular value of g and 1 is the largest one. It is desired that a very small er ror in parameters makes the highest possible effect on the sensor measurements. <p> In fact, we would like to make sure that we achieve the maximum observability of the errors of parameters. So, the ob-servability index is defined as : O = L (12) In <ref> [2] </ref> the observability index is defined as: O = 1 ::: L M where L is the number of singular values of g and M is the number of measurements. A well-known result is that p det (g T g) = 1 ::: L .

Reference-contexts: Boulet applied closed-loop calibration to a mechanical two-loop system formed as a single joint with two antagonistic linear actuators which is a precursor to the present mechanism <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Mechanism Kinematics The mechanism used in the calibration experiments is a 3-DOF platform type closed-chain mechanism with its output link constrained to undergo spherical motions (Figure 1). It is intended to form the shoulder joint for a complete manipulator with a hybrid kinematic design.

Reference-contexts: We calibrate those parameters of the robot to which the end plate orientation is more sensitive. To this end, we used Z-Y-Z Euler angles <ref> [4] </ref> and considered the error produced in ff, fi, and fl of end plate due to errors in different parameters. Figure 3 shows the change in ff , fi, and fl due to 1 mm error in d 01 (offset of the first LVDT).

Reference-contexts: So, this observability index (13) is related to the value of the determinant of g T g. Driels and Pathre mentioned that the condition number of the Jacobian g is an indication of the ob-servability of the parameters to be identified <ref> [5] </ref>: O = k (g) = 1 = L (14) where 1 is the maximum singular value of g and L is the minimum.

Reference-contexts: In (14) we would like to make the hyperellipsoid close to a hy-persphere. In other words, (14) avoids the occurrence of a sharp hyperellipsoid. It can be shown that a large condition number has a great influence on the amplification of the measurement noise <ref> [6] </ref>. If we consider the volume of the hyperellipsoid alone, then there is a risk that the measurement corresponding to the smallest hyperellipsoid axis corrupts our results.

A i (i=1,2,3,4) represents a spherical joint at the stationary side of each actuator. B 1 and B 2 are also spherical and lie in the intersection of the centrelines of each two adjacent actuators.

Reference-contexts: With this technique, the device can regain its original accuracy without external calibration devices. Autonomous calibration is a technique to uphold nominal accuracy over extended periods of operation without maintenance. A 6-DOF Hand Controller was recently calibrated by this approach using double closed loops <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper a similar method is used to calibrate a shoulder joint's kinematic parameters. The parameters include sensor offsets and three other kinematic parameters. Wampler and Arai also used kinematic closed loops to calibrate a three-leg planar parallel-link manipulator [16]. <p> In other words, the routine had a tendency to diverge. So, we measured to 1mm error in d 01 . off-line scale factors of each LVDT using the movements of an accurate milling machine. The sensitivity of the nonlinear optimization algorithm to the gains was also reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. c) We did singular value decomposition of the Jaco-bian and found that k 3 , k 1 , and k 2 make the observ-ability index very low.

Reference-contexts: One should make an appropriate tradeoff between these two factors based on simulation results. Similar considerations have been taken into account by others in the field of robot kinematics. Klein and Blaho analyzed some dexterity measures for the design and control of kinematically redundant manipulators <ref> [10] </ref>. They considered several criteria such as determinant, condition number, and mini mum singular value of the Jacobian matrix of manipulator. For redundant manipulators, manipulability was defined as: q where i (i = 1; :::; m) are the singular values of the Ja-cobian matrix. (17) is similar to (13).

Based on the above assumptions, a good solution for the orientation matrix can be found by manipulating (2) <ref> [11] </ref>. 3 Closed-Loop Calibration Procedure The selection of the parameters to be calibrated is an important issue. In fact, it would be ideal to assume all the kinematic parameters, scale factors (gains) of the sensors, and sensor offsets unknown. <p> Kurtz and Hayward noticed that the low sensitivity of the condition number made it necessary to consider several measures <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we do not deal with the combination of orientation and position. b) Parameter Scaling: We normalize the effect of different parameters on the end-effector pose. Column scaling is a way to achieve parameter scaling <ref> [12] </ref>. The key point is that we normalize the Jacobian to approach the minimum possible condition number.
