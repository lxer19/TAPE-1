Abstract: We propose a new feature distance which is derived from an optimal relational graph matching criterion. Instead of defining an arbitrary similarity measure for grouping, we will use the criterion of reducing instability in the relational graph to induce a similarity measure. This similarity measure not only improves the stability of the matching, but more importantly, also captures the relative importance of relational similarity in the feature space for the purpose of grouping. We will call this similarity measure the self-induced relational distance. We demonstrate the distance measure on a brightness-texture feature space and apply it to the segmentation of complex natural images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In any grouping algorithm, there are two crucial subproblems need to be addressed: (1) the similarity measure between the features, and (2) the grouping criterion and efficient algorithm to solve it. In our previous paper <ref> [20] </ref>, we have addressed the latter problem with normalized cuts. In the normalized cut scheme, the grouping problem is transformed into a graph partitioning problem. <p> With our setting of ffi gap , the first 9 eigenvectors will be used in computing the self induced relational distance. 4.1 Normalized Cuts Using the newly defined texture similarity measure, we can produce a segmentation of a scene using the normalized cut algorithm <ref> [20] </ref>. In the normalized cuts scheme, the image segmentation problem is reduced to a hierarchical graph partitioning problem. In this case, the nodes in the graph are the pixels in the image, and the weights on graph edge connecting two nodes are the self induced relational similarity measures. <p> Although there are efficient computational algorithms for finding partitions that minimizes the cut value, this criterion favors partitions which have small sizes <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> Hence minimizing the dissimilarity between the groups and maximizing the similarity within the groups can be done simultaneously. Let W be the graph weight matrix, and D be the diagonal matrix with D (i; i) = P j W (i; j). In <ref> [20] </ref>, we showed that minimizing N cut can be reduced to minimizing a Rayleigh quotient: min: N cut = min y y T Dy with the condition y i 2 f1; bg and y T D1 = 0. <p> Furthermore, the subsequent eigenvectors are the real valued solutions that form the optimal sub-partitions. From those vectors a discrete partition can be obtained as shown in <ref> [20] </ref>. 4.2 Overall Procedure and Texture Segmentation Result In summary our texture segmentation algorithm can be described as: 1. Compute filter outputs I ; from an input image I, 2. <p> Compute the distance measure O = jU fl A U fl T j, where A fl = U A A U T A , U fl such that 8 (j &gt; k) gap j &lt; ffi gap , 5. Produce image segmentation using normalized cut algorithm <ref> [20] </ref>. The segmentation result using normalized cuts on the self induced relational texture distance are shown in figures (8) and (9). Unlike our previous work, the spatial proximity factor is not used in the segmentation algorithm, hence we obtain somewhat less spatially coherent groups.
