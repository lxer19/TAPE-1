Abstract: This paper presents several efficient heuristic algorithms for scheduling real-time periodic messages in a satellite-switched time-division multiple access (SS/TDMA) system. Previous work in this area considers messages with identical periods and solves the time-slot assignment (TSA) problem which finds conflict-free schedules while minimizing the transmission schedule length and the number of switching modes. We consider the multiple-period TSA (MP-TSA) problem in which real-time periodic messages have different periods and must be scheduled before their deadlines which are equal to their periods. We present simulation results which show the success rates of our algorithms in finding conflict-free schedules.

Reference-contexts: The number of packets generated in each instance of M i is the same, and hence, is an attribute of the period message M i . The number of generated packets was chosen from a uniform distribution in the range <ref> [1; 0:5p i ] </ref>. The periodic message was admitted to the system if, after its addition, the utilization of its input and output links was no more than 1.0.

Reference-contexts: Such a set of messages is said to be schedulable. It is well known that on a single link the earliest deadline first (EDF) and minimum laxity first (MLF) algorithms will find a feasible schedule whenever the link utilization is no more than 1.0 [12, 13]. In <ref> [9] </ref>, Inukai showed that, for an N fi N switch, when the periods of all messages are equal and the utilization of each input and output link is equal to 1.0, a conflict-free feasible schedule can be found by using the system of distinct representatives (SDR) algorithm. 2 In order to <p> In other words, during each time slot in the row being scheduled, the packet with the minimum laxity which does not conflict with any already scheduled packets is scheduled. The second two of our heuristics are based on the system of distinct representatives (SDR) algorithm discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. The SDR algorithm makes use of the information provided by the system traffic matrix. A traffic matrix T is an N fi N matrix.

Reference-contexts: Another objective is to minimize the number of switching modes used, thus simplifying the switch. In this paper, we consider the multiple-period time-slot assignment (MP-TSA) problem of scheduling real-time periodic traffic through a crossbar switch. Liu and Layland <ref> [12] </ref> introduced the periodic message model that we use in this paper. In the periodic model, a message is generated periodically, and the deadline for transmission of a message is equal to its period. A schedule in which all messages meet their deadlines is called a feasible schedule. <p> Such a set of messages is said to be schedulable. It is well known that on a single link the earliest deadline first (EDF) and minimum laxity first (MLF) algorithms will find a feasible schedule whenever the link utilization is no more than 1.0 <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. <p> Liu and Layland <ref> [12] </ref> introduced the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) algorithm which during each slot schedules the message instance with the nearest deadline. They showed that whenever the utilization of the link is less than or equal to 1.0, all message instances scheduled according to the EDF algorithm meet their deadlines.

In <ref> [13] </ref>, Mok showed that the minimum-laxity-first (MLF) algorithm is also optimal.
