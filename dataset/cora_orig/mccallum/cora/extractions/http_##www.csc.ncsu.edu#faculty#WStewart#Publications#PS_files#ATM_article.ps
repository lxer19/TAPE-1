Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of models for the performance analysis of packet delay and loss in a high speed multiplexer. The multiplexer is taken to be of the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) type with the goal of providing a large degree of flexibility in integrating multi-media traffic. We examine a variety of numerical methods for solving these models, including the approach of Ye and Li (which we show is related to a broader class of method called stochastic complementation), recursive techniques, and the matrix geometric method of Neuts. We also suggest other viable candidates such as block Gaussian elimination and iterative methods.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several authors have previously studied voice/data integration on a single ATM link, (see, for example, <ref> [1, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16] </ref>). In many cases voice traffic is modelled by a birth-death process and data traffic by a Poisson process. The problem is then one of solving a two-dimensional Markov chain with a large number of states.

Reference-contexts: Many numerical algorithms for computing the first matrix are based on successive substitution, some of which we have already seen. Prior to the development of quadratically convergent algorithms, the following was considered among the most efficient for QBD processes. 16 Algorithm: QBD | Successive Substitution, <ref> [10] </ref> 1. Initialize: i = 1; U = A 1 ; G = (I U ) 1 A 2 ; 2. <p> The interested reader should consult the original paper, <ref> [10] </ref>, for the formal development of these equations. The complete algorithm is given by: 17 Algorithm: QBD | Logarithmic Reduction, [10] 1. <p> The interested reader should consult the original paper, <ref> [10] </ref>, for the formal development of these equations. The complete algorithm is given by: 17 Algorithm: QBD | Logarithmic Reduction, [10] 1. Initialize: i = 0; B 0 = (I A 1 ) 1 A 0 ; B 2 = (I A 1 ) 1 A 2 ; S = B 2 ; T = B 0 ; 2. <p> For realistic models, the value of * would have to be unreasonably small for this probability to contribute to S. Finally, numerous examples as well as some theoretical results indicate that the logarithmic reduction algorithm is numerical stable, <ref> [10] </ref>. As a simple demonstration, we programmed the four different algorithms for R in Matlab and applied to them to the =C 2 =1 queue with parameters = 1, 1 = 2, 2 = 3 and a 1 = :75. The algorithms are denoted as 1. MG | original.

Reference-contexts: Sections 4 and 5 consider respectively recursive numerical procedures for quasi-birth-death processes and the matrix geometric approach of Neuts, <ref> [13] </ref>. Space limitations prevent us from considering other possible candidate solution procedures such as block methods, both direct and iterative. 2 The Problem Consider a statistical multiplexer that concentrates traffic from multi-media sources. The system has a finite buffer of size K 1 and the service rate is . <p> Since P is stochastic, P e = e and so j X A j e = e for all j. We shall assume that the matrix A, defined as A = P 1 i=0 A i , is stochastic and irreducible. Neuts, <ref> [13] </ref>, defines a sequence of matrices fR (l)g as R (0) = 0; R (l + 1) = i=0 and shows that R (l) R (l + 1) for l 0.

Reference-contexts: This is because the superdiagonal blocks, U , are singular; the first row and column of each is identically zero. In Stewart, <ref> [17] </ref>, it is shown that the major cause of insta-blility in recursive procedures stems from the products of the inverses of the off-diagonal blocks with the other blocks. These inverses may have large elements which may lead to magnification of error.

Reference-contexts: We shall begin in Section 2 by describing in some detail the model we shall use. Since we shall want to examine the numerical procedure advocated by Ye and Li <ref> [20] </ref>, we shall choose their model. Section 2 is therefore a recapitulation of their description. In Section 3, we review the concept of Stochastic Complementation and describe possible algorithms based on this concept; in particular we show that the algorithm of Ye and Li belongs to this class. <p> In this case we have, for example, 1 = 2 OE 1 P 11 e OE 2 P 22 e 3.4 The Algorithm of Ye and Li The algorithm advocated by Ye and Li <ref> [20] </ref> is a variation of this latter implementation, applied to the case when the coefficient matrix is block tridiagonal. Their implementation is most efficient when the number of blocks is a power of two. Consider the following case with 8 blocks.

Reference-contexts: The examples given have N in the order of several hundreds. To proceed beyond this limit, it is necessary to incorporate techniques to reduce the state space and a number of carefully thought out approaches are presented by Ye and Li in <ref> [21] </ref>. However, these reduction techniques are applicable to the entire range of numerical solution procedures and not just the stochastic complementation approach. Given that we are prepared to carry out a number of operations proportional to N 3 a number of alternative approaches compare favorably. <p> Given that we would like to solve models with 3, 4 and even 5 heterogeneous traffic streams, the size of N will rapidly exceed many thousands. In this case state reduction procedures such as those in Ye and Li, <ref> [21] </ref>, are very useful. However, unless the size of N can be reduced to a few hundred, the only possible means of solution lies in iterative methods.
