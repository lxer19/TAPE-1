Abstract: Obtaining accurate structural alerts for the causes of chemical cancers is a problem of great scientific and humanitarian value. This paper follows up on earlier research that demonstrated the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for predictions for the related problem of mutagenic activity amongst nitroaromatic molecules. Here we are concerned with predicting carcinogenic activity in rodent bioassays using data from the U.S. National Toxicology Program conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The 330 chemicals used here are significantly more diverse than the previous study, and form the basis for obtaining Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) relating molecular structure to cancerous activity in rodents. We describe the use of the ILP system Pro-gol to obtain SARs from this data. The rules obtained from Progol are comparable in accuracy to those from expert chemists, and more accurate than most state-of-the-art toxicity prediction methods. The rules can also be interpreded to give clues about the biological and chemical mechanisms of cancergenesis, and make use of those learnt by Progol for mutagenesis. Finally, we present details of, and predictions for, an ongoing international blind trial aimed specifically at comparing prediction methods. This trial provides ILP algorithms an opportunity to participate at the leading-edge of scientific discovery.

Reference-contexts: Mutagenic chemicals have often been found to be carcinogenic ([7]), and we use all the rules found with Progol (see [20] for a complete listing). Structural indicators. We have been able to encode some of the structural alerts used in <ref> [1] </ref>. At the time of writing this paper, the NTP proposes to make available nearly 80 additional structural attributes for the chemicals. Unfortunately, this is not yet in place for reuse in experiments here. Prediction methods The ILP system used here is P-Progol (Version 2.3).

Pattern-recognition methods can ": : : help identify, characterise, and understand the various mechanisms or modes of action that determine the type and level of response observed when biological systems are exposed to chemicals" [6]. Tests conducted by the NTP have so far resulted in a data base of more than 300 compounds that have been shown to be carcinigenic or otherwise in rodents. <p> True biological activity for 13 of these have been determined at the time of writing of this paper. A complete description of chemicals in PTE-2, along with a schedule of dates is available in <ref> [6] </ref>. The remaining activity levels should be determined by 1998. In this paper, we intend to use Progol to obtain structural alerts from chemicals in the NTP data base. In the first instance, predictions from these alerts will be compared against other predictions available for PTE-1.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 concludes this paper. 2 The Carcinogenesis problem and the NTP data base Prevention of environmentally-induced cancers is a health issue of unquestionable importance. Almost every sphere of human activity in an industrialised society faces potential chemical hazards of some form. In <ref> [9] </ref>, it is estimated that nearly 100,000 chemicals are in use in large amounts every day. A further 500-1000 are added every year. Only a small fraction of these chemicals have been evaluated for toxic effects like carcinogenicity. The U.S. <p> The NTP assigns the following levels of evidence: CE, clear evidence; SE, some evidence; E, equivocal evidence; and NE, no evidence. Precise definitions for determining these levels can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>, and a complete listing of all chemicals tested is available at the NTP Home Page: http://ntpserver.niehs.nih.gov/ . The diversity of these compounds present a general problem to many conventional SAR techniques.

Firstly, the data pertain to a relatively homogeneous class of compounds -although, in themselves, they were more diverse than those analysed previously by ILP (see <ref> [13] </ref>). Secondly, while some comparative studies were performed ([22]), they were not against state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for toxicity pre-diction. Finally, a single success is clearly not sufficient grounds for claiming general applicability of a technique. In this paper we remedy each of these shortcomings.

Reference-contexts: This leaves 209 compounds for training. Of these 113 are + and the remaining 96 are . We also note one other detail concerning the procedure for obtaining a final theory. The Prolog implementation used here can obtain clauses using two different search strategies. The first is as in <ref> [17] </ref>, and results in redundant examples being removed after an acceptable clause is found. A second strategy retains these examples, which gives correct estimates for the accuracy of the clause found. Clauses obtained in this fashion can have significant overlap in the examples they make redundant. <p> The preferred final theory is then the subset of these clauses that has maximal compression (within acceptable resource limits). 2 2 This subset is currently obtained by a companion program to P-Progol called T-Reduce (Version 1.0).
