Abstract: We evaluate the SAM-T98 method with four datasets. Three of the test sets are fold-recognition tests, where the correct answers are determined by structural similarity. The fourth uses a curated database. The method is compared against wu-blastp and against double-blast, a two-step method similar to ISS, but using blast instead of fasta. Results

Reference-contexts: A companion paper (Park et al., 1998) compares SAM-T98 on the SCOP test sets with BLAST (Altshul et al., 1990) and FASTA (Pearson & Lipman, 1988) and with two state-of-the-art methods: PSI-BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1997) </ref> and ISS (Park et al., 1997). <p> Some of the more popular sequence-based methods, including PSI-BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1997) </ref> and ISS (Park et al., 1997), have already been tested on the SCOP dataset (Park et al., 1998).

Reference-contexts: The entropy is specified by the number of bits saved relative to the entropy of the background distribution. This relative entropy measure has been used previously to characterize substitution matrices <ref> (Altschul, 1991) </ref>, and the popular BLO-SUM50 and BLOSUM62 matrices corresponds to saving about 0.5 and 0.7 bits per column. The savings for our method varies from 2.5 bits for alignments with only 20 match columns down to about 0.36 bits per column for alignments with over 600 match columns.

Reference-contexts: For the fold-recognition tests, our hmm-based methods did extremely well at all levels of acceptable error, finding many more remote homologs than the more traditional sequence-based methods. A companion paper (Park et al., 1998) compares SAM-T98 on the SCOP test sets with BLAST <ref> (Altshul et al., 1990) </ref> and FASTA (Pearson & Lipman, 1988) and with two state-of-the-art methods: PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and ISS (Park et al., 1997). <p> For example, different transition regularizers were specified and noise and model surgery were not used. Additionally, local alignments, not global alignments, were used. 3.1 Blast-based methods Two of the methods used here are based on the blast search program <ref> (Altshul et al., 1990) </ref>, perhaps the most widely used bioinformatics tool today. This program is extremely fast and easy to use, so evaluating it is essential.

Reference-contexts: It is a curated version of the PIR database (PIR1, release39) <ref> (Barker et al., 1990) </ref> augmented with 237 sequences. In total, it contains 12,216 sequences. 1 We report results here for the "e0" set of 67 target sequences chosen by Pearson. Of the 818,405 possible non-self pairs of the target sequence with database sequences, 3474 (0.4%) were considered correct.

Reference-contexts: When scoring databases with an hmm built for these families, sequences that are compositionally biased toward these residues tend to receive inflated scores and become false positives. Before this observation, scoring involved comparing the log-probability of a sequence for an hmm with its log-probability for a null model <ref> (Barrett et al., 1997) </ref>. To address this problem, we looked at the difference of the log-probability of the sequence and the log-probability of the sequence with a reversed hmm (equivalently, the score of the reversed sequence with the hmm).

Reference-contexts: The use of the fssp tree ensures that no two sequences in the database have more than 25% identical residues in the correct structural alignment. The fssp test set uses dali structure comparison <ref> (Holm & Sander, 1993) </ref> to determine structural homology.

Reference-contexts: The best possible number of false positives (top) and the errors as a function of the number of true positives for the soft-thresholding done in the fssp test. 2.2 SCOP We used two test sets (Brenner, 1996; Park et al., 1997) derived from the Structural Classification of Proteins (scop) hierarchy <ref> (Hubbard et al., 1997) </ref>. For each test set, we used identical lists for both the target list and the database of known folds. A pair was labeled as homologous if both sequences were in the same scop superfamily, otherwise it was labeled as nonhomologous.

Reference-contexts: We used wu-blastp version 2.0a16MP-WashU (available from http://blast.wustl.edu) and SAM suite version 2.0 <ref> (Hughey & Krogh, 1996) </ref>, although the latter was not used with default parameters. For example, different transition regularizers were specified and noise and model surgery were not used. <p> The resulting hmm is then used for database search. The construction, training, and application of the hmms is all done with programs from the SAM package <ref> (Hughey & Krogh, 1996) </ref>. When the database is small, the SAM-T98 method can also be used to create an hmm for each sequence in the database. This database of models can then be searched with the target sequence, providing a two-pronged approach to the search problem.

Reference-contexts: Because of these subtle effects, the reversed sequence is a much more realistic decoy than a scrambled sequence. These effects can affect scoring signifcantly. For example, in the scoring for the CASP-2 contest <ref> (Karplus et al., 1997) </ref>, we had to eliminate by hand some coiled-coil models that scored any helical protein well|the reversed-model scoring eliminates these problems. Also, metal-lothionein (4mt2), with 24 cysteines out of 61 residues, can align well to almost any sequence with conserved cys-teines.
