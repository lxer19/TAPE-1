Reference-contexts: We shall use the Dreiding force field [MOI90] and MM2 force field <ref> [All77] </ref>. MM2 is more widely used but also more complicated than Dreiding. 1.2 Chirality All conformational search algorithms must preserve the chirality of molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.

Reference-contexts: To evaluate our method more completely, we try it on a radically different molecule, rifamycin SV. It is a well known representative of the ansamycin family <ref> [Aro83] </ref> (Figure 4-7). Kolossvary [KG93] has also worked on the conformations of this molecule. He said that it is an extremely difficult conformational search problem for the current technology. The molecule is completely asymmetric. There are strong electrostatic interactions and several 39 intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

Reference-contexts: These inequalities are repeatedly applied until the bounds cannot be tightened any further. Then, coordinates of conformations are generated systematically or stochastically satisfying the upper and lower bounds. These conformations are then minimized. Expert-system-like approaches <ref> [DLP87, AW93] </ref> study the components of molecules and deduce their conformation with a rule set. It is not clear whether their approaches can scale to larger molecules. Several people have developed ring-specific algorithms. They all tried to change local geometry of a ring and then minimize.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1-1 shows a conformation of a macrocyclic molecule. There are many macrocyclic molecules in nature, and they are usually biologically active. For example, a class of macrocyclic molecules called macrolides are important antibiotics <ref> [Omu84, BBNE93] </ref>. Musks are another class of macrocyclic molecules that have a musky aroma. Natural and synthetic musks are widely used in perfumery. 9 Cyclic molecules are very different from acyclic ones because they have the ring closure constraint. Atoms in rings usually do not fall on any lattice.

Reference-contexts: The protein may participate in a disease such as the common cold, cancer, or AIDS. Thus such a molecule could potentially be a cure for a disease. Rational drug design <ref> [BCM93, SSS + 93] </ref> is an approach that finds molecules to fit into the active sites of disease-causing proteins. In order to determine whether a molecule fits into an active site, the molecule's reachable conformations must first be found.

Reference-contexts: The method operates by taking a known conformation and applying limited, random translations ("kicks") to every atom in the molecule. The resulting conformation becomes the new starting geometry for energy minimization. A similar method, internal coordinate Monte Carlo search <ref> [CGS89] </ref>, represents a conformation by its internal parameters. That is, instead of Cartesian coordinates, it uses bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles. The torsion angles are less constrained than other parameters. In each step of the algorithm, several torsion angles are randomly varied.

Reference-contexts: Most of the CPU cycles are spent on minimizing the energy function. Starting from a random conformation, each minimization takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 2 under BatchMin V3.5 <ref> [Dep90] </ref>. Cartesian stochastic search, internal coordinate tree search and Monte Carlo search, and distance geometry all require about 10,000 minimizations each for the 51-atom molecule. Therefore, these algorithms would take about 7 days on a SPARCstation 2. <p> For the following results on cycloalkane, only 30 minima are found using the randomized method in Step 1 of the top level procedure. Our program is first run on cyclopropadecane (Figure 4-2), the 13-carbon cy-cloalkane, to validate its completeness. We use BatchMin V3.5 <ref> [Dep90] </ref> and its MM2 force field for minimization. E is set to 6 KCal/mol. Figure 4-3 shows the results of the new algorithm and Cartesian stochastic search running on the molecule. After 2000 Monte Carlo steps, 15 conformers are found to be within 3 KCal/mol of the global minimum.

Reference-contexts: To form a new starting conformation, a rigid transformation is needed to transform the end bonds and other atoms of the complementary component. This is achieved by the algorithm in <ref> [FH77] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear whether their approaches can scale to larger molecules. Several people have developed ring-specific algorithms.

By looking at all pairs of bonds and computing their planarity, we explore more conformational space more efficiently. There is also a bigger chance of lowering total energy because more bonds are changed.

They all tried to change local geometry of a ring and then minimize. They use operations like corner flapping [GO89], edge flipping <ref> [GO93] </ref>, and torsion flexing [KG93]. The running time of these methods are similar to other techniques. Chapter 4 compares their performance to our new approach. <p> For chain or tree-like molecules, one can simply change the torsional angle of some single bonds because these molecules do not have the closure constraint. Finding such operators for macrocyclic molecules is much harder. Other researchers have used operators like corner flapping or edge flipping <ref> [GO93] </ref>, but the candidates they generate have much higher energy than the global minimum. This is because some local geometries (bond angles) are deformed. Before presenting the operators we use, we make two observations about the low-energy conformations. 1. Low-energy conformations have low-energy components. 2. <p> The scanning process has O (mn 2 ) complexity where m is the number of conformations given and 24 the component's mirror image. n is the number of bonds forming the ring. Goto's operators are special cases of this operator. Corner flapping [GO89] reflects two bonds while edge flipping <ref> [GO93] </ref> reflects three bonds. By looking at all pairs of bonds and computing their planarity, we explore more conformational space more efficiently. There is also a bigger chance of lowering total energy because more bonds are changed. Section 4.1 compares the complementarity approach with Goto's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Can the operators be applied to components of any size? With a few approximations, we can find the limitation to the sizes of components. We assume that all bond lengths and bond angles are fixed, but the dihedral angles are free to change. Go and Scheraga <ref> [GS70] </ref> have shown that two fixed end bonds would generate six nonlinear equations on the dihedral angles. Therefore at least six dihedral angles are needed to satisfy the equations. To apply the operators, the smallest component would have six bonds (Figure 2-5).

Reference-contexts: Numerical minimization with gradient descent or conjugate gradient would be trapped in a local minimum close to the starting conformation. Other global optimization techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms could find the global minimum, but they are very inefficient <ref> [MJ93, GW92] </ref>. The conformational search problem is generally believed to be NP-hard [UM93]. The best systematic method has 6 n complexity for tree-like molecules where n is the number of single bonds.

Reference-contexts: The molecule changes its conformation due to thermal vibration. At certain time intervals, the algorithm collects the conformations of the molecule being simulated and minimizes them. The systematic version of internal coordinate Monte Carlo search is internal coordinate tree search <ref> [LS88] </ref>. Each torsion angle of a single bond is searched through a series of possible values (e.g. 0 o ; 60 o ; 120 o ; 180 o ; : : :).

Reference-contexts: Energy functions are also called force fields because the force acting on a molecule due to its conformation can be found by differentiating the energy function. (F = rE) There are several published energy functions with slightly different sets of parameters. We shall use the Dreiding force field <ref> [MOI90] </ref> and MM2 force field [All77]. MM2 is more widely used but also more complicated than Dreiding. 1.2 Chirality All conformational search algorithms must preserve the chirality of molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.

Reference-contexts: Most methods do not distinguish between cyclic and acyclic molecules. These techniques can be separated into two categories: stochastic methods and systematic methods. The simplest stochastic technique is Cartesian stochastic search <ref> [Sau87] </ref>. It represents a conformation by the Cartesian coordinates of each atoms. The method operates by taking a known conformation and applying limited, random translations ("kicks") to every atom in the molecule. The resulting conformation becomes the new starting geometry for energy minimization.

Reference-contexts: For example, with the 51-atom molecule in figure 1-1, all methods use more than 30 CPU days on a MicroVAX II to find most low-energy conformations <ref> [SHW + 90] </ref>. Most of the CPU cycles are spent on minimizing the energy function. Starting from a random conformation, each minimization takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 2 under BatchMin V3.5 [Dep90]. <p> The complementarity method is 3.48 times faster. More importantly, the result suggests that the algorithm completely explores the low-energy conformational 33 space. The second cycloalkane used as a benchmark is cycloheptadecane, the 17-carbon cycloalkane. Saunders <ref> [SHW + 90] </ref> applied seven methods to search for its conformations. He found that the methods have similar performance. First, we try several techniques using the Dreiding force field. Figure 4-4 compares their performance on this molecule. Our algorithm finds the most useful conformations in the shortest time. <p> Table 4.3 is a comparison of the rate of conformational search during the early stage.

Rational drug design <ref> [BCM93, SSS + 93] </ref> is an approach that finds molecules to fit into the active sites of disease-causing proteins.

Reference-contexts: All published algorithms take several days on typical workstations to find all stable conformations of a medium sized molecule. New ring-specific algorithms can perform much better than these general algorithms. 10 1.1 Energy Function In a typical energy function <ref> [Tes79] </ref>, the potential energy (E) is the sum of energies from bonded interactions (E val ) that depend on the specific bonds, and nonbonded interactions (E nb ) that depend only on the distances between atoms.

Reference-contexts: Other global optimization techniques like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms could find the global minimum, but they are very inefficient [MJ93, GW92]. The conformational search problem is generally believed to be NP-hard <ref> [UM93] </ref>. The best systematic method has 6 n complexity for tree-like molecules where n is the number of single bonds. This method cannot guarantee finding the global minimum because it scans only a few values for each torsional angle. The global minimum may not be accessible from the scanned values.

Reference-contexts: Its computational complexity is exponential in the number of single bonds. Just as this method's stochastic counterpart, it would also 16 generate many ring structures that violates the closure constraint. Hence this method is quite wasteful of resources for macrocyclic molecules. The Distance geometry <ref> [WJW + 83] </ref> method stores the ranges of distances between atoms in matrices. Each element of a matrix represents the distance between two atoms. A lower bound matrix and an upper bound matrix are used for the algorithm. Each element is computed using constraints like bond length and bond angle.
