Abstract: Because of the enormous complexity inherent in many data-intensive problem-solving tasks, even experts become overly-specialized in a restricted region of the problem space and fail to develop techniques that apply outside of this region. This results in the troubling phenomenon of strategic bias, which leads problem solvers down inappropriate paths, frequently causing premature abandonment of a problem and, ultimately, failure. We propose anti-bias stereotypes as a mechanism to counteract strategic bias. By exploiting these stereotypes, an intelligent consultant can recognize situations in which the biases may negatively impact users' problem solving, and recommend alternative strategies that would likely have gone unconsidered. We have designed and implemented a prototype anti-bias stereotype modeling system in the context of the GENOME COLLABORATOR, an intelligent advisory system that assists molecular biologists in the Human Genome Project. Initial empirical studies conducted to assess the effectiveness of anti-bias stereotyping are encouraging.

Reference-contexts: With the promise of substantial theoretical and applied results, the field has witnessed a growing body of research in task-oriented dialogue systems (Carberry 1989; Quilici 1989; McCoy 1989 1990; Zukerman 1992), explanation systems (Moore & Paris 1993; Suthers 1993; Lester 1994), and and critiquing systems <ref> (Fischer et al. 1991) </ref>. Automated consultants can play a particularly important role in hyper-complex problem-solving tasks. Hyper-complex problems are common in data-intensive scientific domains such as molecular biology, where sophisticated data collection and intricate analyses are prerequisites to success.
