Abstract: There are two basic strategies used for carrying out the illumination computation the gathering strategy in which light reaching a point from all directions is simulated and the shooting strategy in which light emitted from a point in all directions is simulated. Based on the strategy used, all the existing methods can be classified into two broad categories, namely gathering methods and shooting methods. The radiance equation provides the mathematical basis for the gathering methods and the potential equation provides the mathematical basis for the shooting methods. They together form an adjoint system of equations. In this paper, using the mathematical framework of the adjoint equations we review illumination computation methods, categorising them as using the gathering or shooting strategy or both. Another basis for categorisation is the basic equation solution strategy used, namely deterministic or nondeterministic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There are basically two approaches used for the computation of global illumination. In one the luminous flux reaching a surface or eye point is estimated by sampling its surroundings. Ray tracing, path tracing and full matrix radiosity solution are extensively researched methods <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref> based on 1 this approach. The other approach is based on simulating the propagation of light starting from the light sources of which progressive radiosity [5] and particle tracing [6] are representative methods. <p> So if a significant amount of indirect light is incident from a mirror reflection direction then it is accounted for. Thus for computing the interreflection component, a ray is traced <ref> [1] </ref> along fi 1 y , the mirror reflection direction of fi x , where y is the visible point when viewed from x along fi 1 y .

The light sources are often localised and contribution from any point on the source is almost always significantly more as compared to the contribution from a reflector. Cook et al <ref> [2, 15] </ref> have presented a Monte Carlo solution to estimate the integral term in two stages. In the first stage, the source term, is estimated by sampling the light source surfaces and in the second stage, the inter-reflection term, is estimated by sampling the surface brdf.

The other approach is based on simulating the propagation of light starting from the light sources of which progressive radiosity [5] and particle tracing [6] are representative methods. <p> For example: in image rendering the color of a pixel is assigned by computing the radiance from all the surface points visible to the eye through that pixel and in a spread of directions made by each such point with the aperture of the eye. 1 Kajiya's rendering equation <ref> [3] </ref> is basically a slightly different form of this equation. <p> The average of such estimates computed over a large number of paths pro-vides a more accurate estimate of the actual solution. Kajiya proposed such a solution method for the rendering equation and the method is widely known as path tracing <ref> [3] </ref>. Path tracing differs from distribution ray tracing in that in path tracing a single ray emerges from each point where as in distribution ray tracing a large number of rays emerge from a single point. <p> However, the requirement of tracing a large number of paths to get a reasonable estimate of the solution makes it as expensive as distribution ray tracing. Though path tracing in general cannot be considered as being very efficient, Kajiya <ref> [3] </ref> suggests careful use of various variance reduction techniques such as hierarchical and nonuniform sampling to make path tracing as an efficient and acceptable alternative for accurate illumination computations. 7 Deterministic Shooting Methods As we said earlier the shooting process simulates the physical process of light distribution.

Reference-contexts: Ray tracing, path tracing and full matrix radiosity solution are extensively researched methods [1, 2, 3, 4] based on 1 this approach. The other approach is based on simulating the propagation of light starting from the light sources of which progressive radiosity <ref> [5] </ref> and particle tracing [6] are representative methods. While illumination computation methods for computing the flux reaching the surface or the eye are primarily based on the radiance equation, the potential equation provides the basis for methods which simulate light propagation starting from the light sources. <p> One has to resort to various numerical quadrature 2 The terms gathering and shooting were first introduced by Cohen et al in the context of explaining the difference in the strategy used by the full radiosity solution and the progressive radiosity algorithms <ref> [5] </ref>. techniques to get a reasonably accurate solution for this integral equation. Such methods may be considered as being deterministic or nondeterministic. Nondeterministic methods are generally based on principles of Monte Carlo quadrature. A method specific to the solution of integral equation of the second kind is the random walk. <p> As the sources are the ones responsible for illumination in the environment, intuitively a method based on the shooting strategy would be natural for computing illumination of the whole environment. However, the very first use of such a method in illumination computation, widely known as progressive radiosity <ref> [5] </ref>, was proposed only in 1988. The method came as an extension to the standard radiosity method for increasing efficiency and is based on the observation that: Radiosity computation of any patch requires the gathering of radiosity from every other patch in the environment.

In this method, particles carrying a finite amount of energy are emitted in random directions from random positions on the surfaces of the light sources.

Reference-contexts: Because of the computational simplicity these methods have been used very widely for many years, to produce shaded pictures of 3D objects. The very first equation of this kind is due to Bouknight <ref> [7] </ref> who gives the expression for the radiance 3 from diffuse surfaces as follows: L o (x) = a (x)L a + k d (x) j=1 As the outgoing radiance is considered from a perfectly diffuse surface L o is independent of the outgoing direction, k d is the diffuse reflection

Reference-contexts: Phong <ref> [8] </ref> subsequently introduced an important improvement to this model for supporting shiny surfaces. Reflection from every surface is assumed to have a diffuse reflection component and an imperfect specular reflection component which is modelled by Phong's reflection model.

Reference-contexts: As most of the surfaces in the environment are diffuse, the sampled directions largely lead to diffuse surfaces whose radiance values are already known as a result of the first pass. (ii) Direction Discretisation: This method <ref> [14] </ref> attempts to solve the directional distribution problem by discretising the hemispherical directions around a non-diffuse patch into a finite number of solid angles, in which the brightness is assumed uniform. Surfaces are also divided into small discrete patches.

Reference-contexts: Along any sample direction, contribution due to emission is only known. The light sources are often localised and contribution from any point on the source is almost always significantly more as compared to the contribution from a reflector. Cook et al <ref> [2, 15] </ref> have presented a Monte Carlo solution to estimate the integral term in two stages. In the first stage, the source term, is estimated by sampling the light source surfaces and in the second stage, the inter-reflection term, is estimated by sampling the surface brdf.

Reference-contexts: A number of attempts have been made to increase the efficiency of distribution ray tracing. One such attempt is the caching mechanism proposed by Ward et al <ref> [16] </ref> for diffuse environments. In a diffuse environment the brdf over a point is uniform in all the hemispherical directions.

Reference-contexts: Extensions to Nondiffuse Environment The shooting strategy can also be used for two pass methods and the directional discretisation method discussed in the earlier section. An important extension <ref> [17] </ref> that has been proposed for dealing with non-diffuse surface reflectance behaviour is the use of spherical harmonics for the representation of the directional variation in the outgoing radiance of a point on a non-diffuse surface.
