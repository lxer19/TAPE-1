Abstract: We describe and examine the performance of adaptive methods for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on massively parallel computers. The differential system is approximated by a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method with a hierarchical Legendre piecewise polynomial basis for the spatial discretization. Fluxes at element boundaries are computed by solving an approximate Riemann problem; a projection limiter is applied to keep the average solution monotone; time discretization is performed by Runge-Kutta integration; and a p-refinement-based error estimate is used as an enrichment indicator. Adaptive order (p-) and mesh (h-) refinement algorithms are presented and demonstrated. Using an element-based dynamic load balancing algorithm called tiling and adaptive p-refinement, parallel efficiencies of over 60% are achieved on a 1024-processor nCUBE/2 hypercube. We also demonstrate a fast, tree-based parallel partitioning strategy for three-dimensional octree-structured meshes. This method produces partition quality comparable to recursive spectral bisection at a greatly reduced cost.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the size of the problem scales easily with the number of processors. Indeed, for two-dimensional problems on rectangular domains with periodic boundary conditions, scaled parallel efficiencies in excess of 97% are achieved <ref> [11] </ref>. To achieve parallel efficiency with irregular structures, parallel finite element methods often use static load balancing [19,21] as a precursor to obtaining a finite element solution. Parallel efficiency degrades substantially due to processor load imbalances with adaptive enrichment. <p> A basis for the local space S j may be defined using products of one-dimensional Legendre polynomials, as distinct from hierarchical bases for elliptic and parabolic systems [34] which use integrals of Legendre polynomials. Two-dimensional bases involving tensor products of Legen-dre polynomials have been constructed for quadrilateral <ref> [11] </ref> and triangular [15] elements. A three-dimensional basis for tetrahedral elements could follow procedures developed for elliptic systems [34]. Results presented in Section 5 for tetrahedral-element meshes involve only piecewise constant approximations. <p> The movement of the superconver-gence points from the Legendre points at t = 0 toward the Radau points for t &gt; 0 is gradual, occurring over several time steps <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus, the effectiveness of the estimate improves as the computation progresses.

Reference-contexts: Examination of the small scale (bottom) results reveals that the interface proportion is less than 12% when the partition size exceeds 1000 for these meshes. Interfaces drop to below 9% and 8%, respectively, for partition sizes of 2000 and 3000. This performance is comparable to recursive spectral bisection <ref> [22] </ref> but requires much less computation (O (J ) as opposed to O (J 2 ) [27]). The best performance occurred with the helicopter mesh, which was the only mesh of a solid object (as opposed to a flow field surrounding an object).

Reference-contexts: We have developed an adaptive p-refinement method for two-dimensional systems that uses dynamic load balancing to adjust the processor decomposition in the presence of nonuniform and changing work loads. Tiling [37] is a modification of a dynamic load balancing technique developed by Leiss and Reddy <ref> [24] </ref> that balances work within overlapping processor neighborhoods to achieve a global load balance. Work is migrated from a processor to others within the same neighborhood. We demonstrate the improved performance obtained from a combination of p-adaptivity and parallel computation on several examples using a 1024-processor nCUBE/2 hypercube. <p> In tiling, we extend the definition of a neighborhood to include all processors having finite elements that are neighbors of elements in the center processor (see Figure 4.1). Tiling neighborhoods are not related to the hardware interconnection of the processors as were the neighborhoods of Leiss and Reddy <ref> [24] </ref>. Every processor is the center of one neighborhood, and may belong to many neighborhoods. Elements are migrated only to processors having neighbors of the migrating elements. The tiling algorithm consists of (i) a computation phase and (ii) a balancing phase, and is designed to be independent of the application.

Reference-contexts: Three-Dimensional Mesh Partitioning. We describe a tree-based partitioning technique which utilizes the hierarchical structure of octree-derived unstructured meshes to distribute elemental data across processors' memories while reducing the amount of data that must be exchanged between processors. An octree-based mesh generator <ref> [30] </ref> recursively subdivides an embedding of the problem domain in a cubic universe into eight octants wherever more resolution is required. Octant bisection is initially based on geometric features of the domain but solution-based criteria are introduced during an adaptive h-refinement process. <p> Example 5.

Reference-contexts: Finite difference schemes for (1.1), such as the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) [33,36] and Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) <ref> [31] </ref> methods, usually achieve high-order accuracy by using a computational stencil that enlarges with order. A wide stencil makes the methods difficult to implement on unstructured meshes and limits efficient implementation on massively parallel computers.
