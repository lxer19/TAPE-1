Abstract: At ICIP-96 and ICASSP-97 we presented a methodology for incorporating perfect extracted MRI anatomical boundary estimates to improve the performance of penalized likelihood (PL) ECT image reconstruction and ECT tracer uptake estimation. This technique used a spatially variant quadratic Gibbs penalty which enforced smoothness everywhere in the ECT image except across the MRI-extracted boundary of the ROI. When high quality estimates of the anatomical boundary are available and MRI and ECT images are perfectly registered, the performance of this Gibbs penalty method is very close to that attainable using perfect side information, i.e. an errorless anatomical boundary estimate. However when the variance of the MRI-extracted boundary estimate becomes significant this method performs poorly. Here we present a modified Gibbs penalty function which accounts for errors in side information based on an asymptotic min-max robustness approach. The resulting penalty is implemented with a set of averaged Gibbs weights where the averaging is performed with respect to a limiting form of the min-max induced posterior distribution of the MRI boundary parameters. Examples will be presented for tracer uptake estimation using the SAGE version of the EM algorithm and various parameterizations of the anatomical boundaries.

Reference-contexts: However when the variance of the MRI-extracted boundary estimates becomes significant this penalty function method performs poorly. This poor performance is due in large part to the fact that the Gibbs weights do not account for estimation errors in the anatomical boundary estimates. In <ref> [7] </ref> a technique called variance corrected weighting was proposed which relied on a local Taylor series expansion of the Gibbs weights about the estimated spline parameters. This scheme applies only to weight assignments that are smooth functions of the spline parameters for which Taylor series can be applied. <p> This scheme applies only to weight assignments that are smooth functions of the spline parameters for which Taylor series can be applied. Furthermore, even for the smooth weight assignments presented in <ref> [7] </ref> the method is accurate only when the uncertainty in the extracted boundary estimates are less than a single MRI pixel width. Here we present a variance corrected weighting which applies globally to non-smooth weights. <p> Background Let Y E and Y MRI be two random measurements corresponding to (Poisson) ECT projections and (Gaussian) NMR spin density images, respectively. In <ref> [7] </ref> two different methodologies were proposed for extracting anatomical boundary estimates from noisy MRI images for the purpose of incorporation into ECT.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 3 we show results of Monte Carlo simulations for three different types of variance-corrected weights, each corresponding to dif ferent ways of estimating the Fisher information matrix, labeled true, expected or observed Fisher information (using the terminology of <ref> [9] </ref>). In this figure we plot the % standard deviation against % bias of total and mean uptakes in the estimated ROI, when oe n = 0:50. The performance using the 3 different types of Fisher information are very close to each other and to the ideal curve.
