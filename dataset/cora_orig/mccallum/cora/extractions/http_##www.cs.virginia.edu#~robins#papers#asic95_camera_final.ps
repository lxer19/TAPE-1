Abstract: Motivated by improving FPGA performance, we propose a new three-dimensional (3D) FPGA architecture, along with a fabrication methodology. We analyze the expected manufacturing yield, and raise several physical-design issues in the new 3D paradigm. Our techniques also have good implications for resource utilization, physical size, and power consumption.

Reference-contexts: In order to mitigate the heat-dissipation problem, we must investigate ways of reducing power consumption in 3D FPGA architectures. For current chip designs, a large portion of the total power is expended in driving input and output buffers <ref> [1] </ref>. However, when chips are interconnected using MCM technology, such I/O buffers are often unnecessary, which tends to significantly reduce the power consumption [1, 10, 11]. <p> For current chip designs, a large portion of the total power is expended in driving input and output buffers [1].

Reference-contexts: For example, if the post-join testing procedure determines that one or more solder bump contacts has failed, the defective part may still be salvaged by recording the faulty logic/routing resources. These defective resources can be later avoided by the physical-design software.

Reference-contexts: Higher operating temperatures can lead to less reliable operation (e.g., heat stress on the solder bumps can introduce interconnect shorts). A number of MCM thermal-reduction techniques (i.e., thermal bumps and pillars [7], thermal gels <ref> [5] </ref>, etc.) may also be applicable for 3D FPGAs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are (re)programmable chips that can implement arbitrary logic. FPGAs provide designers with a faster and more economical design cycle <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this flexibility is achieved at the cost of a substantial performance penalty, due primarily to interconnect delay. This penalty can account for over 70% of the clock cycle period [14, 16]. We propose a new three-dimensional (3D) FPGA architecture.

Reference-contexts: Connections which traverse the board level generally incur higher delays than chip-level connections. Thus, MCM technology is an appealing alternative to board-level interconnect. Some researchers have proposed adding a surrounding programmable interconnection frame to the FPGA die, using the MCM substrate for connections between frames <ref> [10] </ref>. We offer an alternative architecture for implementing our 3D logical FPGA architecture using current MCM technology.

Reference-contexts: Since a 3D FPGA offers the equivalent usable-gate-count of multiple 2D FPGAs of similar physical size, a given circuit design will occupy significantly smaller physical space when implemented on a 3D FPGA, as compared with a circuit-board-based 2D FPGA implementation <ref> [15] </ref>. Moreover, 3D FPGAs have good implications with respect to power consumption. Finally, 3D FPGAs raise a number of new challenges in manufacturing and physical design. 2 The 3D FPGA Architecture A typical 2D FPGA architecture is a symmetrical array of logic blocks interconnected by routing resources.

Reference-contexts: For example, signal propagation delay through the routing resources is primarily a function of the number of programmable switches (pass transistors) that must be traversed, rather than the total length of the metal wires <ref> [17] </ref>. Thus, a signal which goes through fewer programmable switches should experience shorter delay. This fact motivates the long ("double-length") routing segments in newer 2D FPGA architectures [18].

With this in mind, we may choose to separate the logical and physical architectures (i.e., a single logical architecture may have multiple distinct implementations).
