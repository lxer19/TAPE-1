Abstract: Efficient and powerful topologically adaptable deformable surfaces can be created by embedding and defining discrete deformable surface models in terms of an Affine Cell Decomposition (ACD) framework. The ACD framework, combined with a novel and original repa-rameterization algorithm, creates a simple but elegant mechanism for multiresolution deformable curve, surface, and solid models to "flow" or "grow" into objects with complex geometries and topologies, and adapt their shape to recover the object boundaries. ACD-based models maintain the traditional parametric physics-based formulation of deformable models, allowing them to incorporate a priori knowledge in the form of energy and force-based constraints, and provide intuitive interactive capabilities. This paper describes ACD-based deformable surfaces and demonstrates their potential for extracting and reconstructing some of the most complex biological structures from medical image volumes.

Reference-contexts: By providing a boundary representation as well as a representation of the interior region of an object, this hybrid deformable model combines the space partitioning, intrinsic parameterization and topological flexibility properties of an implicit formulation, such as those described in <ref> [1, 7] </ref>, with the boundary properties of a parametric model.

Reference-contexts: The framework also provides a convenient mechanism for the incorporation of "hard" geometric, topological and global shape constraints <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper, we will review the 3D ACD framework and describe the formulation of topologically adaptable deformable surfaces (T-surfaces). <p> node i a time varying position x i (t) = [x i (t); y i (t); z i (t)], along with internal "tension" forces ffff ff i (t) and "rigidity" forces fifi fi i (t), external inflation forces aeae ae i (t), and external image edge forces f i (t) <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Determining the set of grid vertices that have been burned during a deformation step uses a simple and robust classification algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. Each T-surface triangle may have passed over zero, one, or several grid vertices during a deformation step. For each triangle, we form a bounding box around its current position and new position, enabling us to quickly determine the subset of grid vertices that may have been burned.

Reference-contexts: New parameterizations can change the model energy in arbitrary ways. Our goal is the development of a unified, complementary framework that overcomes the limitations of classical deformable models and increases their degree of automation, while retaining all of their traditional strengths. In <ref> [10] </ref>, we introduced a new class of 2D deformable models known as topologically adaptable snakes (T-snakes). These models exploit an Affine Cell Decomposition (ACD) of the image domain, creating a theoretically sound framework that significantly extends the abilities of classical deformable models.

Reference-contexts: Global or region image statistics can be used. Another solution is to use a Chamfer distance map, which provides the distance to the nearest edge, to again weight the inflation force.

Finally, since ACD-based deformable models are naturally multi-resolution models, this feature can be used with multi-scale image preprocessing techniques [4, 14] to improve the robustness of the segmentation. 5 Conclusion Deformable models offer a flexible and powerful approach to medical image analysis.
