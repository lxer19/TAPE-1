Abstract: A framework is proposed for the investigation of planning systems that must deal with bounded uncertainty. A definition of this new class of contingency planners is given. A general, complete contingency planning algorithm is described. The algorithm is suitable to many incomplete information games as well as planning situations where the initial state is only partially known. A rich domain is identified for the application and evaluation of contingency planners. Preliminary results from applying our complete contingency planner to a portion of this domain are encouraging and match expert level performance.

Reference-contexts: These problems are close to the most difficult problems possible in this domain. On the most difficult card combinations, the algorithm searches through a space of 2 2 6 1:8 fi 10 19 possible world sets to find the solutions. One of the tricky problems in <ref> (Lawrence, 1988) </ref> is North: J 10 x opposite South: A x x. Defense has the remaining cards, K Q x x x x x, in some unknown distribution. The goal is to obtain two tricks. The algorithm finds 3 plans which are summarized using bridge play terminology in Figure 6. <p> For example, the second plan works in the 6 possible worlds listed. The performance of the algorithm on the entire Lawrence problem set is illustrated in Figure 7. The first three columns of the figure list the problem number from <ref> (Lawrence, 1988) </ref>, Possible Worlds Plan Summary West has K or Q South plays low to J, West has K x or Q x if West plays honor, duck and finesse East East has K Q if West plays low, play J and next A West has K or Q South plays

Reference-contexts: Currently, we are unable to theoretically predict this reduction as it depends on the particular constraints that arise. Nevertheless, the approach is efficient and further work is under way to extend the approach to problems on a larger scale. An approach patterned after <ref> (Ruby & Kibler, 1991) </ref> is under development and involves problem decomposition, planning contingencies for subproblems, and the merging of subproblem solutions. 11
