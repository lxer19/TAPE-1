Reference-contexts: An extension, which Gauss will later call general elimination (elim-inatio indefinite), can be used to pass from the normal equations (3.5) to the inverse system (3.6). 6 Gauss, Statistics, and Gaussian Elimination 4. The Scalar Connection In 1810, in Disquisitio de Elementis Ellipticis Palladis <ref> [3] </ref>, Gauss gave the numerical details of his algorithm and illustrated it with an example. The usual scalar formulas for Gaussian elimination can be derived by translating the original algorithm into operations on the matrix of second derivatives of .

Reference-contexts: In this case the method of least squares no longer has the status of a law ordained by the probability calculus and has only the simplicity of the operations it entails to recommend it. In the Pars Prior of his memoir Theoria Combinationis Observationum Erroribus Minimis Obnoxiae <ref> [7] </ref>, Gauss resolved the dilemma by introducing the notion of mean square error as a measure of variance and showing that among all linear combinations of the observations that produced exact estimates in the absence of error the least squares estimates have least mean square error.

Reference-contexts: There is no indication that the paper had any influence on Gauss, or anyone else. 1 2 Gauss, Statistics, and Gaussian Elimination regard for the principle itself, and even said he thought others must have used it before him.

Reference-contexts: Yet it was the first of many reductions of quadratic and bilinear forms that later became our familiar matrix decompositions, including among others the LU decomposition, the Jordan canonical form, and the singular value decomposition. As Kline points out in his book Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times <ref> [13, Ch. 33] </ref>, by the time the use of matrices had become widespread, many of the principal results of matrix theory had already been established. Gauss's algorithms, written in his notation, survived into the twentieth century, especially in books on geodesy.

Reference-contexts: In his correspondence, Gauss asserted that he had discovered the principle of least squares in 1824 (or 1825, the dates vary). Gauss seems to have had little 1 The quibble is that in 1759, in the very first paper to appear in his collected works <ref> [14] </ref>, Lagrange gave the basic computational formulas for Gaussian elimination. His purpose, however, was to determine if a critical point was a minimum, not to solve linear equations.

Reference-contexts: The result was a priority dispute, which need not concern us here. 4 In the Theoria Motus, Gauss had assumed the errors in the observations were normally distributed. In 1811, Laplace <ref> [17] </ref> used his central limit theorem to give an essentially different justification of least squares.

Reference-contexts: Gauss gives two algorithms for computing T, one of them particularly advantageous when only a few variances are to be computed. 7 Laplace, for example, recommended a similar procedure in the first supplement to his Theorie Analytique des Probabilites <ref> [18] </ref>. Gauss, Statistics, and Gaussian Elimination 9 The second method is a very general result for computing the variance of an arbitrary linear combination t = g T b + of the unknowns b.

Reference-contexts: Chronicles The principle of least squares arose from the problem of combining sets of overde-termined equations to form a square system that could be solved for the unknowns. The problem went under the name of the combination of observations, and has been well surveyed by Stigler <ref> [23] </ref> in his History of Statistics. By way of background, I will relate in chronological order the major events in the story of least squares, from Gauss's first discovery to his final treatment in the 1820's.
