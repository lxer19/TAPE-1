Abstract: The importance of information technology, as a mechanism for creating and sustaining competitive advantage, is a concept understood by many private and public sector organisations. The continuous investment in IT, in both sectors, and the gradual alignment of global business and information systems thinking has reduced the utility of traditional models of strategy. This paper advocates the Soft Systems view for the purpose of formulating information systems strategy; derived from end-users and other stakeholders participatively using Future Workshops. The history of the Scan-dinavian approach in development is fast becoming an accepted approach: this paper attempts to convey this message of participative democracy in the context of strategic information systems planning.

Reference-contexts: These three points differ quite significantly with regards to the premise underlying their individual ideologies. There is clearly a strong relationship between democratic empowerment of end-users RN/96/122 Page 5 Stakeholder Participation in SISP Ismail Ismail and Russel Winder and the surrender of power from the CEO and management staff <ref> (Bravo, 1993) </ref>. The implications of this power struggle, and the degree to which an organisation fosters participation and decision making, represents a step which has to be made in order to achieve greater democratisation (Greenbaum, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Galliers argues that IS strategy should be concerned with what is required of an IS rather than how and subsequently distinguishes this criteria with a what/how/who distinction in his model. Galliers suggests that the adoption of a socio-technical perspective would better represent the human activity <ref> (Checkland, 1981) </ref> aspect of an IS, however, the manner in which this perspective would manifest is not described and left at a conceptual level. 3.3 The Derivation of Strategic Plans The previous section provided a brief review of the evolution of strategic thinking. <p> The missing link between strategic thinking and implementation is, perhaps, a detail that is crucial RN/96/122 Page 4 Stakeholder Participation in SISP Ismail Ismail and Russel Winder to the correct development of an IS, therefore we are advocating the utilisation of Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) <ref> (Checkland, 1981) </ref> as a bridge between the gulfs of strategy thinking and implementation: towards a refined model of SISP that incorporates the notion of the human activity system, which in turn will encourage stakeholder participation into the abstract notion of IS planning. 4 Participation in the Context of SISP The pitfalls <p> The facilitator should allow the participants to debate the Strategic Statement and produce a rich picture collaboratively. The rich picture should represent notions of structure, processes and issues (issues should be represented using crossed-swords!) and should represent the strategic situation in its environment <ref> (Checkland, 1981) </ref>. 6.1.2 The Fantasy Problem themes and conflicts are extracted from the rich picture and are inserted into relevant root definitions. Like SSM the proposed SISP approach encourages the textual specification of the human activity system. This is confirmed through the creation of the CATWOE checklist.

Reference-contexts: The extent of democratic empowerment raises the issue of people's rights to participate as equals in decision making that has relevance to them <ref> (Clement, 1994) </ref>. 4.2 Future Workshops There are many techniques which aim to foster the spirit of participation, however, many deal with design decisions and human-computer interaction issues rather than strategic analysis.

Reference-contexts: To this end, IT is fast becoming the perceived solution to many inefficient business processes (Hammer, 1990). The implications of this scenario would suggest that the planning of information systems should also manifest in the form of increased advantage over competitors, furthermore, should perhaps drive strategy formulation itself <ref> (Currie, 1995) </ref>. <p> Organisations determine a business mission and objectives, examine their data needs accordingly, develop databases and then fuse an overall information system architecture. BSP has been strongly criticised for not forging strong links between corporate objectives and the IS plan <ref> (Currie, 1995) </ref>. Rockart's (Rockart, 1979) CSF is a popular formal approach which asks managers to identify essential (or critical) factors to the business' success then design systems appropriate to satisfying those factors: the technology itself is then responsible for the state of competitive advantage (Cur-rie, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Galliers (1991) informs us that in excess of 75% of British Companies undertake some sort of SISP activity; he further points out that much of the activity bears little resemblance to those proposed in conventional (formal-rational) models of strategy formulation <ref> (Gray, 1986) </ref>. The practice of strategic planning is one which is dominated by the chief executive officer (CEO) and senior executives (Mintzberg, 1994); it is likely to be an annual activity which coincides with financial planning.

Reference-contexts: Mintzberg stereotypes a common technique of strategists as the Mountain Retreat method; for inspiration and abstract debate. An obvious problem with this approach is that the balance between economic and socio- technical factors rests almost entirely in the hands of strategists and not with likely end-users <ref> (Ismail & Winder, 1996) </ref>. If we follow this logic through, this would suggest that the subsequent development of an IS may satisfy corporate and information technology (IT) objectives, in terms of generating competitive advantage, however may not necessarily satisfy end-users and other stakeholders.

Reference-contexts: Future Workshops were originally devised for citizen groups with limited resources who wanted to contribute towards the decision making process of public planning authorities <ref> (Jungk & Mullert, 1987) </ref>. More recently, they have been utilised by Kensing & Madsen (1991) as a technique for the participatory design of information systems. Future Workshops enable users to focus directly on the problems and concepts that govern their tasks. <p> A future workshop is divided into three phases: Critique phase: designed to draw out issues about current work practice and thinking. Speaking time is restricted to thirty seconds to allow all participants to express themselves <ref> (Jungk & Mullert, 1987) </ref>. Fantasy phase: allows participants the freedom to use their imagination on issues they feel are of significance. No extremes are specified in order to allow free thought. Implementation phase: participants rationalise their ideas into the real world and reason about the resources that would be required.

Reference-contexts: No extremes are specified in order to allow free thought. Implementation phase: participants rationalise their ideas into the real world and reason about the resources that would be required. These three phases should be surrounded by preparation and follow-up periods <ref> (Kensing & Mad-sen, 1991) </ref>. During the critique and fantasy phases the facilitators (moderators) should encourage the participants to document their ideas on sheets of paper around the room; these notes can then be used as the premise for the next phase.

Reference-contexts: The practice of strategic planning is one which is dominated by the chief executive officer (CEO) and senior executives <ref> (Mintzberg, 1994) </ref>; it is likely to be an annual activity which coincides with financial planning. <p> Quinn is making an important point: the formal approach to planning draws attention to the quality of the decisions generated and not to the overall outcome of the procedure <ref> (Mintzberg, 1994) </ref>. Thus, adopting Quinn's metaphor one could argue that the rise and fall of strategic planning (Mintzberg, 1994) will reach its status-quo only when the methods for generating plans are subject to appropriate evaluation (other than the test of time). <p> Quinn is making an important point: the formal approach to planning draws attention to the quality of the decisions generated and not to the overall outcome of the procedure <ref> (Mintzberg, 1994) </ref>.

Overall, there is much interaction between the various stages including feasibility testing and planning studies.

He asserts that the most effective decision-makers are usually creative and intuitive people. Digman (1990) clearly supports the more interpretive approach to planning <ref> (Mintzberg, 1994) </ref>. 3.2 Models of Strategic Information Systems Planning BSP (IBM, 1978) is perhaps the best known approach to IS planning and involves top down planning for information systems with a bottom-up implementation.
