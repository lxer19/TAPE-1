Reference-contexts: Introduction The study of spatial and temporal aspects of multi-species biological systems is central to ecology. Epidemics have special significance in terms of agriculture, public health and ecology. Szymanski and Caraco <ref> [4] </ref> have developed a cellular automata for spatially explicit modeling of population dynamics and epidemics. A software package named TEMPEST implements this model on several high performance (parallel) computers [1, 2, 3], additional information is available on-line.
