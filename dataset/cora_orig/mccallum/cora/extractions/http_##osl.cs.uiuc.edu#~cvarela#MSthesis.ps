Reference-contexts: HTTP is a generic object-oriented stateless protocol to transmit information between servers and clients <ref> [1] </ref>. HTTP consists of different methods that define the interaction between the servers and clients. The most common methods are: * HEAD, which gets the header information on a given document.

Reference-contexts: Then, it introduces the reader to existing CGI scripts for WAIS, relational and object-oriented database manager systems. Finally, it highlights some work on interacting stateful information services with the World-Wide Web. 2.1 World-Wide Web The World-Wide Web <ref> [2, 3] </ref> offers easy access to a universe of information by providing links to documents stored on a world wide network of computers in a very simple and understandable fashion. <p> When the documents to be published are dynamic, like those resulting from queries to databases, the hypertext needs to be generated by the servers <ref> [3] </ref>. For this purpose, there are scripts, which are programs that perform conversions from different data formats into HTML on-the-fly.

Reference-contexts: HTML is a simple, yet powerful platform-independent document language <ref> [4] </ref>. An example of an HTML document follows: &lt;TITLE&gt;The simplest HTML example&lt;/TITLE&gt; 9 &lt;H1&gt;This is a level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt; Welcome to the world of HTML. This is one paragraph.&lt;P&gt; And this is a second.&lt;P&gt; 2.1.3 Universal Resource Locators Universal Resource Locators define uniquely where documents can be found.

Reference-contexts: Currently, we only concentrated in browsing databases. There is a lot of research that needs to be done in authentication and authorization for databases operating in an open environment such as the Web. Bina et all. <ref> [5] </ref> present a good study of some of these security issues.

Reference-contexts: These queries can be performed transparently and independently from particular DBMS implementations. And second, the Object Definition Language or ODL, which is a standard developed by the Object Database Management Group (ODMG) <ref> [6] </ref> that allows database designers to define object oriented database schemas independently from particular database manager implementations. 10 2.2.1 Standard Query Language The Standard Query Language allows you to express queries to relational databases. These databases consist of tables with fields and relationships between those tables. <p> On the other hand, the interface itself can be customized without affecting the database server. The dispatcher script consists of the following modules: * Request manager This determines the type of the query and references the appropriate routine. * Parser for the ODL schema It parses the ODL schema <ref> [6] </ref> into a generic structure, suitable for handling any ODL schema.

Reference-contexts: These performance modifications could include sorting tables, and creating or deleting indexes. 22 CHAPTER 4 Zelig Example: Gateway to the CCSO Phone Directory Servers In this chapter, we provide a detailed example of a Zelig program to access CCSO phone nameservers around the world running the ph/qi software <ref> [8] </ref>. First, we discuss several forms to access this service through the Web; and second, we discuss several schemata to produce different hypertext reports for given user queries.

Reference-contexts: These are text-based indexes that allow keyword-based searches. There have also been several attempts to integrate relational database management systems, including GSQL [17], and MORE <ref> [9] </ref>. Zelig, which will be described in Chapter 3, allows for interaction with relational database manager systems as well as object-oriented database management systems. 2.3.3 Object-Oriented DBMS and Stateful Transactions A more interesting but less explored field, is that of interacting with object-oriented database management systems.

Reference-contexts: In both cases, the script returns the information to the clients, via the HTTP server, using standard output. 2.3.2 WAIS Indexes and Relational DBMS A traditional searching mechanism in the Web is performed by WAIS <ref> [10] </ref> gateways. These are text-based indexes that allow keyword-based searches. There have also been several attempts to integrate relational database management systems, including GSQL [17], and MORE [9]. <p> Consequently, we created different forms for each particular method: * ISINDEX: With this method, only one query field forms are allowed. This was the first interface to dynamic documents to exist in the Web and its main usage was to provide a gateway to WAIS <ref> [10] </ref>. * GET: With this method, the query information is appended to the URL by clients and submitted to the server. <p> However, we implemented a fourth form using the POST method and showing a more advanced interface to this service. 4.1.1 Form using ISINDEX phfa 2 : A simple form using the HTML ISINDEX tag. This tag was historically used mainly for WAIS <ref> [10] </ref> Indexes. This kind of form allows only one query field and doesn't require submit buttons. 2 http://fiaker.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/cgi-bin/phfa 24 4.1.2 Form using GET phfb 3 : A simple user interface for this database application.

Reference-contexts: Two exemplary applications have been implemented: a university course registration system and an electronic mailbox manager. On the WWW server side, DB used C/Lex/Yacc for the dispatcher script and NCSA HTTPd [13], a high-performance HTTP server. On the database server side, DB used C++ and ObjectStore <ref> [11] </ref>, an object-oriented database management system, with a page-server architecture.

Reference-contexts: These programs also need to understand the queries performed by clients through HTML forms and the results generated by the applications owning the data (for example,a DataBase Manager System.) 13 2.3.1 Common Gateway Interface The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) <ref> [12] </ref> defines how these scripts communicate with the HTTP servers. In this way, we can reuse CGI-compliant scripts independently of the server software being used to provide information. There are two main interfaces defined by two of the most common HTTP methods, GET and POST.

Reference-contexts: The World-Wide Web consists of a network of computers which can act in two roles: as servers, providing information; or as clients, requesting for information. Examples of server software are NCSA HTTPd <ref> [13] </ref> and Netscape Communications Server [15], while examples of client software are NCSA Mosaic [14] and Netscape Navigator [16]. <p> Two exemplary applications have been implemented: a university course registration system and an electronic mailbox manager.

Reference-contexts: Sjolin [21] describes a front-end to LINCKS. 14 One desired feature is that of keeping a stateful connection with the database for perfor-mance.

Reference-contexts: However, this requires security measures, protocols and standards that have not been tested widely enough in an open environment to be considered safe. 1.3 Proposed Solutions In this thesis, we describe the development of an architecture, Zelig <ref> [24] </ref>, attacking the first two problems: the need for CGI programming and flexible user interfaces to databases. We also discuss DB, a Database Browser [25] that attacks the third problem, database performance degradation because of the stateless nature of the Web. <p> Some authors [19, 18] have described their work on interacting stateful information services with the WWW.

Reference-contexts: We also discuss DB, a Database Browser <ref> [25] </ref> that attacks the third problem, database performance degradation because of the stateless nature of the Web. The fourth and final problem is beyond the scope of this study. For fixed data formats, writing CGI scripts may not be too complicated. <p> This provides a similar look-and-feel interface for clients of different database applications. Implementations of these extra functions for several commercial database manager systems are currently going under way. 38 CHAPTER 6 DB: A Complimentary Approach for Ob ject-Oriented Databases In this chapter, we discuss DB, a Database Browser <ref> [25] </ref> for object-oriented databases in the Web. DB introduces an architecture which drastically improves performance when the databases reside completely in a single machine. This thesis discusses DB, envisioning a future framework integrating Zelig and DB for effectively, transparently and efficiently browsing heterogenous databases over the World-Wide Web.
