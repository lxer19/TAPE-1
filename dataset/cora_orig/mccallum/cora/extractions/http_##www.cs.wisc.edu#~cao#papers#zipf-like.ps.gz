Abstract: This paper addresses two unresolved issues about Web caching. The first issue is whether Web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's law [Zip29]. Several early studies have supported this claim [Gla94, CBC95, ABCdO96] while other recent studies have suggested otherwise [NHo + 98, ACC + 98]. The second issue relates to a number of recent studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces [CI97, RV98, DMF97, GB97a, KLM97]. In particular, the second issue is whether these properties are inherent to Web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate both Web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen by Web proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribution does not follow Zipf's law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where the Web accesses are independent and the reference

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have observed that the relative frequency with which Web pages are requested follows Zipf's law [Zip29].

Reference-contexts: The numbers show that the correlation, if any, is weak and can be ignored. 2.3 Correlation between Access Frequency and Change Rate Another question of interest is whether popular documents change less often than unpopular ones. The answer affects designs of Web cache consistency mechanisms <ref> [GS96] </ref>. From the traces, we observe the changes in a document by detecting changes in the last-modified-time of each response or changes in the document size of each response. Only two of our traces, DEC and UCB, come with the last-modified-time information.

Reference-contexts: In looking at Web proxy traces, researchers have also investigated how the hit-ratio depends, asymptotically, on the cache size and the number of requests, and have examined the temporal locality of these request streams <ref> [CI97, RV98, DMF97, GB97a, KLM97] </ref>. <p> Many Web caching studies reach this conclusion <ref> [ABCdO96, Gla94, CI97, WAS + 96, GB97a, RV98, CBC95, DMF97] </ref>. * The probability that a document will be referenced k requests after it was last referenced is roughly proportional to 1=k. That is, Web traces exhibit excellent temporal locality. <p> Given the coarseness of the data, it is impossible to distinguish between a logarithmic and a small power growth. 3 investigated temporal locality, Rizzo et al. observed this property in the Web proxy traces collected at University of Pisa, Italy <ref> [RV98] </ref>, while Cao et al. observed this property in the Digital Equipment Corporation's proxy traces [CI97, KMM96]. These observations were offered without an underlying explanation. It is not clear whether these properties follow certain inherent characteristics of Web accesses or are simply an artifact of the collection of traces studied. <p> This result is qualitatively consistent with previously observed behavior that the hit-ratio increases logarithmically or as a small power as a function of cache size <ref> [ABCdO96, Gla94, CI97, WAS + 96, GB97a, RV98, CBC95, DMF97] </ref>. These references do not claim any particular form for the asymptotic behavior, but their data appears to grow in a log-like (or small-power-like) fashion in the asymptotic regime. modifications. <p> The model's predictions, in the intermediate regime, are qualitatively consistent with data observed at operational web servers <ref> [RV98, CI97] </ref>. We have also examined the request interarrival behavior in our traces.

Reference-contexts: We only examine GET requests, and only those whose URLs do not include query strings, since most proxies do not cache query requests. The trace includes 2,833,624 requests. * Questnet traces <ref> [Wee98] </ref>: 7-days worth of logs of HTTP requests seen by the parent proxies at Quest-net, which is a regional ISP in Australia, from Jan. 15 to Jan. 21, 1998. The proxies are parent proxies serving about 12 child proxies in the regional network.

Reference-contexts: It is considered one of the most important techniques at reducing Web traffic, which accounts for a large percentage of Internet traffic today. Several researchers have observed that the relative frequency with which Web pages are requested follows Zipf's law <ref> [Zip29] </ref>. Zipf's law states that the relative probability of a request for the i'th most popular page is inversely proportional to 1/i. <p> We assume that P N (i), defined for i = 1; 2; : : : ; N , has a cut-off Zipf-like distribution given by P N (i) = i ff ; where = i=1 i ff The true Zipf's law <ref> [Zip29] </ref> has ff = 1 but in this paper we consider a broader class of distribution functions with exponents in the range 0 &lt; ff 1. Each page request is drawn independently from the Zipf distribution, so we are neglecting any other source of correlations in the request stream.
