Abstract: In preparation for the flight of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) on board the Space Shuttle in the spring of 1994, a Level-1 automatic classifier was developed on the basis of polarimetric SAR images acquired by the JPL AirSAR system. The classifier uses Land C-Band polarimetric SAR measurements of the imaged scene to classify individual pixels into one of four categories: tall vegetation (trees), short vegetation, urban, or bare surface, with the last category encompassing water surfaces, bare soil surfaces, and concrete or asphalt-covered surfaces The classifier design uses knowledge of the nature of radar backscattering from surfaces and volumes to construct appropriate discriminators in a sequential format. The classifier, which was developed using training areas in a test site in Northern Michigan, was tested against independent test areas in the same test site and in another site imaged 3 months earlier. Among all cases and all categories, the classification accuracy ranged between 91% and 100%.

Reference-contexts: Although the cross-polarized phase difference (OE hv OE vv ) is also available from the measured polarimetric response, it contains no useful information about the target because it is uniformly distributed over <ref> [0; 2] </ref> for most distributed targets [10]. In addition to these eight image attributes, the classifier uses textural information by computing the normalized variance for each pixel.

Reference-contexts: In an earlier SAR classifier <ref> [3] </ref> all vegetation was lumped into one class: insufficient for our future needs. Simulated annealing was used by Rignot and Chellappa in an attempt to post-process the results of an MLE classifier [4] and performed quite well, yielding better than 95% classification accuracy for up to 13 classes.

Reference-contexts: However, simulated annealing is a complex and time-consuming procedure to apply over an entire image. Wong and Posner <ref> [5] </ref> developed a clustering technique that can automatically devise the best number of classes and their means in feature space using a simulated annealing procedure. The classifier was based on the Mahalonobis distance [6] from each of these class means.

Reference-contexts: For the bare surfaces, contextual information is to be used when 2 separating water surfaces from bare ground surfaces. For the latter, an inversion algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> is applied to determine the soil moisture content and surface roughness. In practice, bare soil surfaces include surfaces with very short vegetation cover (less than 15 cm in height).

Reference-contexts: pixel is characterized by four measured quantities at L-Band: oe 0 vv (L), oe 0 hv (L), and i (L); and a similar set at C-Band, where oe 0 vv , oe 0 hv are the backscattering coefficients and i is the co-polarized phase difference (OE hh OE vv ) <ref> [9] </ref>. Although the cross-polarized phase difference (OE hv OE vv ) is also available from the measured polarimetric response, it contains no useful information about the target because it is uniformly distributed over [0; 2] for most distributed targets [10].

Reference-contexts: The measured normalized variance (oe=) 2 , for a given polarization, is comprised of two components: a component due to specke, (oe=) 2 s , and a component due to scene texture (spatial inhomogeneity) at the SAR resolution scale <ref> [11] </ref>. The latter is denoted (oe=) 2 t . The measured normalized variance is related to the individual variances through [11]: (oe=) 2 = (oe=) 2 t + (oe=) 2 t : (1) Denoting M = (oe=) 2 as the measured variance, S = (oe=) 2 s as the speckle variance, <p> given polarization, is comprised of two components: a component due to specke, (oe=) 2 s , and a component due to scene texture (spatial inhomogeneity) at the SAR resolution scale <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Application of this 9 aggregator improves the clasification accuracy somewhat, but the image has dramatically less "speckle" (Fig. 6). To allow a visual comparison of classification accuracy, a classification map from 15 years ago <ref> [14] </ref> is shown in Fig. 7. This map was manually interpreted from air photos. We have reclassified it so that only the four classes that our classifier uses are visible.
