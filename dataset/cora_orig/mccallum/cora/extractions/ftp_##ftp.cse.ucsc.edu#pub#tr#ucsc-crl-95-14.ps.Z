Abstract: L-bases and B-bases are two important classes of polynomial bases used for representing surfaces in CAGD. The Bezier and multinomial bases are special cases of both L-bases and B-bases. We establish that certain proper subclasses of bivariate Lagrange and Newton bases are L-bases and certain proper subclasses of power and Newton dual bases are B-bases. A geometric point-line duality between B-bases and L-bases is described and used to investigate the duality between geometric representations for bivariate Bezier and multinomial bases, Lagrange and power bases, and Newton and Newton dual bases for surfaces. Under this geometric duality, lines in L-bases correspond to points or vectors in B-bases and concurrent lines map to collinear points and vice-versa. The generalized de Boor-Fix formula for surfaces also provides an algebraic duality between L-bases and B-bases. This algebraic duality between B-bases and L-bases can be used to develop change of basis algorithms between any two of these bases. We describe, in particular, a change of basis algorithm from a bivariate Lagrange L-basis to a bivariate Bezier basis.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the generalized Newton dual basis is obtained by restricting one of the three sets of vectors in the knot-net to contain exactly one element. The homogeneous Newton dual basis for surfaces defined here is a generalization of the Newton dual basis for curves <ref> [BG93] </ref>. Observe that the Bezier, multinomial, and BM B-bases are special cases of the Newton dual basis.

Reference-contexts: A duality principle relating homogeneous L-bases and B-bases will be used to show that the Lagrange and generalized Newton bases are dual to the power and generalized Newton dual bases. This duality between homogeneous L-bases and B-bases can be derived using a multivariate polynomial identity <ref> [CM92] </ref> or by generalizing the de Boor-Fix dual functionals from curves [dBF73] to surfaces [LG94d].

Reference-contexts: B-patches were first introduced by Seidel [Sei91] and later shown to agree with multivariate B-splines on a certain region of the parameter domain <ref> [DMS92] </ref>. The basis functions for the B-patches, that is the B-bases, are known to be local multivariate generalizations of univariate B-splines.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the affine Newton basis for surfaces defined here is a generalization of the affine Newton basis for curves. To justify the terminology Newton basis, we are going to establish that these Newton L-bases are special cases of the bivariate Newton bases defined by Gasca <ref> [Gas90] </ref>. Gasca starts with a particular set of lines and points and associates a Newton basis to this point-line configuration. In contrast, our construction proceeds in the opposite direction. We have other stronger incentives for establishing this connection. <p> This freedom in choosing the interpolation problem carries over to the bivariate setting. Although Gasca <ref> [Gas90] </ref> observes that there is some freedom, his construction does not clarify the role of freedom in choosing the lines and points. For our purposes, it is essential to explore the nature of this non-uniqueness in order to specify certain interesting point-line configurations associated with Newton L-bases. <p> This point-line configuration associated with a Newton L-basis is a subclass of the point-line configurations that form the starting point for the construction of Newton bases defined by Gasca <ref> [Gas90] </ref>. With this associated point-line configuration, it can be readily verified that the Newton L-bases defined here can be realized as special cases of the bivariate Newton bases defined by Gasca. Now we are in a position to describe the interpolation system associated with this New-ton L-basis. <p> Now we are in a position to describe the interpolation system associated with this New-ton L-basis. Our procedure is exactly the same as in <ref> [Gas90] </ref>. Let s ff be the number of functions in the set fL 1;1 ; ; L 1;ff 1 +1 ; L 2;1 ; ; L 2;ff 2 +1 g that vanish at v ff and coincide with L 1;ff 1 +1 up to constant factors. <p> It is not too difficult to prove that this interpolation problem has a unique solution and that the interpolant expressed in terms of the Newton L-basis can be found by solving a lower triangular system of linear equations. The proof of this fact is also described by Gasca <ref> [Gas90] </ref> and is therefore omitted here. In fact, the coefficients of the solution can be interpreted as the generalization of divided differences to higher dimensions. Further discussion 22 4. <p> In fact, the coefficients of the solution can be interpreted as the generalization of divided differences to higher dimensions. Further discussion 22 4. Examples of Dual bases of the extremely important role the Newton bases play in multivariate interpolation and approximation can be found in <ref> [Gas90] </ref>. The configurations of lines and points corresponding to Newton L-bases are very flexible. <p> It is not yet clear whether or not every configuration of lines and points that gives rise to a Lagrange L-basis also gives rise to a Newton L-basis. More interestingly, one can ask whether a configuration of lines and points satisfying the GC condition or HGC condition <ref> [Gas90] </ref> always gives rise to a Newton L-basis. The HGC conditions, in particular, generalize the Hermite interpolation conditions to higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes the terminology Taylor basis or power basis is also used instead of monomial or multinomial basis. However, we shall refer to this basis as the multinomial basis in accordance with <ref> [GB92] </ref> and reserve the term power basis for the basis discussed later in Section 4.2.2. The standard multinomial basis is defined by the origin (0; 0) and the unit vectors (1; 0) and (0; 1).
