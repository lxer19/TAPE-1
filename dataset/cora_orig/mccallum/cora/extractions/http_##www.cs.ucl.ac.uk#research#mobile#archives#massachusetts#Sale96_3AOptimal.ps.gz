Abstract: VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. We present two basic results. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish the optimality of our optimal smoothing approach, and illustrate its performance over a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guaranteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be dramatic. fl An earlier version of this paper appeared at the 1996 ACM SIGMETRICS conference. y This work was supported by NSF under grant NCR-9206908 and by ARPA under ESD/AVS contract F-19628-92-C 0089.

Reference-contexts: For space considerations, we restrict attention to a sampling of the representative behavior. 20 6 Guaranteed service We begin with an overview of the service model, and then turn to performance results. 6.1 Overview Under Guaranteed service, the network provides hard guarantees. Suppose the user requires bounded delay service <ref> [1] </ref>: for each packet sent, the end-to-end delay through the network must not exceed some a priori bound. (This implies that no packets are lost). A call admission algorithm admits the stream into the network only if it can guarantee that the delay bound will never be exceeded. <p> The least upper bound, E (t), is known as the minimum envelope process <ref> [1] </ref> (or empirical envelope [11]). Computed at the frame level for a stored video with N frames, E (t) is given by: E (t) = max k+t X f (j); (1) where f (j) is the size of the j th frame. <p> In the algorithm, T i;j is the minimum cost reservation schedule over segments [i; j] without renegotiations: T i;j = OE ( max (c k ))( k=i Let T i;j be 0 if i &gt; j. ! 1;i denotes the cost of cheapest reservation schedule over segments <ref> [1; i] </ref> with r or fewer renegotiations. The algorithm begins by computing, for each segment i, the minimum-cost reservation from the beginning of the video through i (i.e., over [1; i]) with no renegotiations (Lines 1-2). It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or <p> k=i Let T i;j be 0 if i &gt; j. ! 1;i denotes the cost of cheapest reservation schedule over segments <ref> [1; i] </ref> with r or fewer renegotiations. The algorithm begins by computing, for each segment i, the minimum-cost reservation from the beginning of the video through i (i.e., over [1; i]) with no renegotiations (Lines 1-2). It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimum cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over [1; j] with (r 1) renegotiations, <p> reservation schedule over segments <ref> [1; i] </ref> with r or fewer renegotiations. The algorithm begins by computing, for each segment i, the minimum-cost reservation from the beginning of the video through i (i.e., over [1; i]) with no renegotiations (Lines 1-2). It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimum cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over [1; j] with (r 1) renegotiations, followed by a renegotiation after segment j if j 6= i, followed by the cheapest reservation over <p> It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimum cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over <ref> [1; j] </ref> with (r 1) renegotiations, followed by a renegotiation after segment j if j 6= i, followed by the cheapest reservation over [j + 1; i] without renegotiations. <p> Once B is finished, the cost of the cheapest 28 reservation schedule over <ref> [1; n] </ref>, with R or fewer renegotiations, is given in ! (R) 1;n . B requires O (n) space to compute ! (R) 1;n , since only ! (r1) is needed to compute ! (r) . <p> Further, as we have shown, end-to-end jitter can be accommodated in a straightforward manner. Motivated by the intuition that a smoother stream should require fewer resources, we have considered the impact of optimal smoothing under two well-known network service models: Guaranteed service (e.g., <ref> [1, 11] </ref>) and Renegotiated CBR service [9]. Work-ahead smoothing (optimal or otherwise) has not previously been evaluated under either model. We find performance of Guaranteed service improves dramatically under optimal smoothing, with network utilizations increasing by as much as a factor of 3 for bursty VBR streams.

Reference-contexts: The call admission algorithm must ensure that the probability of rejection is acceptably low. On a renegotiation failure, the server must adapt to the allocated bandwidth. For stored video, one alternative is to transmit a subset of the stream if it has been scalably compressed <ref> [2] </ref>, which enables decoding at multiple frame rates, resolution granularities and/or spatial sizes. MPEG-2, for example, contains support for limited scalable compression. Another possibility is to dynamically re-quantize the stream at a lower bit rate.

Assume the n streams are homogeneous (i.e., for all i, A i (t) = A (t)) and require common delay bound d. In this case, FIFO, SP and EDF behave identically, and the admission control test is as follows.

Reference-contexts: We begin with an overview of the service model. 7.1 Overview Under CBR network service, the server reserves network resources at the stream's peak rate. While CBR service offers many advantages (e.g., call admission and switch scheduling are simplified <ref> [7] </ref>), 25 (a) d ms jitter work-ahead (b) 500 ms jitter work-ahead bounds. Here, a 100 ms (3-frame) startup latency is introduced. in addition to the delay required for jitter work-ahead. <p> This corresponds to a mean renegotiation time ranging from 23 minutes to 14 seconds. The maximum number of unsmoothed streams which can be admitted is also shown. Since network jitter is less of an issue under CBR service <ref> [7] </ref>, we assume it is zero. Thus, we consider as the base case that the client has sufficient buffer space to store only the largest frame (43 KB for this video), which is the minimum needed to support the unsmoothed transmission schedule in the absence of network jitter.

The network can limit the renegotiation frequency indirectly, through pricing (i.e., by making the cost of renegotiations high) <ref> [9] </ref>, or directly, by imposing a bound R on the number of allowable renegotiations over the length of the session. We will assume the latter scenario. To avoid any a priori assumptions about the feasible range of renegotiation frequency, we treat R as an independent parameter. <p> In light of the multiple-time-scale variability of VBR video, there is a growing interest in renegotiated services (e.g., <ref> [9, 8, 27] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In the following sections, we consider two network service models: Deterministic Guaranteed service (or simply Guaranteed service) as formulated in <ref> [11] </ref>, and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service, as formulated in [9]. Guaranteed and CBR service models have been widely studied, and are of particular interest for the transport of compressed video. The benefits of work-ahead smoothing have not been previously evaluated under either model. <p> It permits no statistical multiplexing, since statistical performance is incompatible with hard guarantees. The advantage is guaranteed performance; the disadvantages are added delay and potentially low utilization for bursty VBR streams under moderate delay bounds <ref> [11] </ref>. As we shall see, under optimal smoothing the performance of Guaranteed service can improve dramatically for bursty VBR-encoded streams. * RCBR is closely related to traditional CBR service, and employs no temporal multiplexing within the network. <p> A i is the traffic constraint function for stream i, and d i is the negotiated bound on queuing delay at the output port. We use the formulation of bounded-delay Guaranteed service given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider a single network switch, as depicted in Figure 8. Suppose the n incoming streams are routed to the K th output port and that delay through the switch fabric is constant. Let the capacity of the outgoing link be C bits/s. <p> The least upper bound, E (t), is known as the minimum envelope process [1] (or empirical envelope <ref> [11] </ref>). Computed at the frame level for a stored video with N frames, E (t) is given by: E (t) = max k+t X f (j); (1) where f (j) is the size of the j th frame. <p> In this section, we use A i (t) = E i (t); in [25], we also consider concave upper bounds to E i (t), each specified by a set of (oe; ae) pairs.

Assume the n streams are homogeneous (i.e., for all i, A i (t) = A (t)) and require common delay bound d. In this case, FIFO, SP and EDF behave identically, and the admission control test is as follows. <p> Second, to determine the maximum number of admissible streams for a given transmission schedule and delay bound, we compute a traffic constraint function for the schedule, and apply the admission control test (equation 2 for homogeneous streams with identical delay bounds; see <ref> [15, 11] </ref> for other cases). <p> Here, this translates to assuming the client has a nominal buffer capacity of E (500 ms) = 135 KB. The figure demonstrates the benefit of optimal smoothing, in comparison to the case in which the server follows an unsmoothed transmission schedule, as in <ref> [11] </ref>. 2 With optimal smoothing into the nominal buffer space, the number of admissible streams increases by as much as 100%. With an additional 256 KB at the client, performance improves even further, with network utilization rising above 70%. <p> There, we also explore the impact of optimal smoothing for a practical traffic constraint function (the empirical envelope E is difficult to police <ref> [11] </ref>), finding that optimal smoothing enables simple, policable constraint functions to achieve near-comparable performance. In addition, we consider the case of heterogeneous streams with distinct delay bounds, as well as practical switch scheduling policies and call admission algorithms. <p> Further, as we have shown, end-to-end jitter can be accommodated in a straightforward manner.

In <ref> [21] </ref>, Reibman and Berger assume for the sake of analysis that the stream frame sizes are known a priori. <p> Since S fl is unique (Section 3), this implies that they are in fact using the smoothest possible transmission schedule as well. Thus, with respect to reducing rate variability, the results in <ref> [21] </ref> can be viewed as establishing an upper bound on the performance of any online smoothing algorithm. Several other papers have examined smoothing of delay-sensitive, online compressed video (e.g., [13, 19, 26]).

Reference-contexts: In [21], Reibman and Berger assume for the sake of analysis that the stream frame sizes are known a priori. They then apply Lee and Preparata's shortest path algorithm [14] in the context of the encoder and decoder buffer timing constraints <ref> [22] </ref> to derive a schedule which reduces the peak rate at which frames are drained from the encoder buffer. 4 While they suggest as motivation that the shortest-path schedule should maximize the effectiveness of the allowable delay, they state without proof that it minimizes the peak transmission rate.

Reference-contexts: Toward the other extreme is peak rate allocation, which captures only the worst-case behavior over a single frame time, i.e., A i (t) = tE i (1). In this section, we use A i (t) = E i (t); in <ref> [25] </ref>, we also consider concave upper bounds to E i (t), each specified by a set of (oe; ae) pairs. Exact admission control tests are known for FIFO, SP, and EDF link scheduling policies [3, 11]. <p> These results suggest that under optimal smoothing with sufficient client buffer space, Guaranteed service need not introduce delay in order to achieve high utilization. 6.2.3 Further results Further performance results can be found in <ref> [25] </ref>. There, we also explore the impact of optimal smoothing for a practical traffic constraint function (the empirical envelope E is difficult to police [11]), finding that optimal smoothing enables simple, policable constraint functions to achieve near-comparable performance. <p> While we use B in the evaluation of optimal smoothing under RCBR throughout the remainder of this section, in <ref> [25] </ref> we discuss and present several extensions to the algorithm. First, the additional constraint of a minimum time between renegotiations is easily incorporated, while retaining the O (Rn 2 ) time complexity. <p> If the network does not impose a bound on the number of renegotiations, the time complexity can be reduced from O (Rn 2 ) to O (n 2 ) (see Algorithm C in <ref> [25] </ref>). In addition, it is an easy generalization to support a more general renegotation cost function. Finally, note that B finds the minimum-cost reservation schedule for a given transmission schedule. <p> The same setup is used for the stored video case. One limitation of this formulation is that it can necessitate a large startup delay in client playback (see discussion in Appendix B of <ref> [25] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus, with respect to reducing rate variability, the results in [21] can be viewed as establishing an upper bound on the performance of any online smoothing algorithm. Several other papers have examined smoothing of delay-sensitive, online compressed video (e.g., <ref> [13, 19, 26] </ref>). The approach always involves the introduction of delay to enable smoothing, and can be coupled with adaptive congestion control techniques to dynamically adjust the encoder output rate [10]. Heuristics for forecasting future frame sizes may be employed (e.g., based on the specific compression pattern, as in [13]). <p> Heuristics for forecasting future frame sizes may be employed (e.g., based on the specific compression pattern, as in [13]). At the level of cell smoothing, Shroff and Schwartz <ref> [26] </ref> have established that deterministic injection of cells into the network approaches minimum achievable loss under multiplexing and routing. For stored video, Feng and Sechrest [5] have also considered work-ahead smoothing into client buffer space. They do not, however, consider the problem of reducing stream variability.

Reference-contexts: In light of the multiple-time-scale variability of VBR video, there is a growing interest in renegotiated services (e.g., <ref> [9, 8, 27] </ref>). While our study of renegotiated CBR is based directly on the work of Grossglauser, Keshav and Tse [9, 8], our formulation is somewhat different. They simultaneously consider both stored video and video generated online.
