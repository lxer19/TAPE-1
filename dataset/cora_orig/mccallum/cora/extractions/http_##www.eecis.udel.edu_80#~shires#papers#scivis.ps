Note: Abstract  
Abstract: The importance of graphical visualization and animation in manufacturing process simulations cannot be overstated. Indeed, without effective scientific visualization tools, process simulation resultant data cannot be properly interpreted and analyzed. Software and hardware can be combined to convert what used to be page after page of printed numerical results into animated, easy to see results which are quickly rendered on graphical displays. Results that used to take days of careful study to understand can now be comprehended in minutes. With this understanding in mind, we have set out to develop novel ways to both view and interface with our manufacturing process simulations. This paper discusses our selection methodology for the hardware and software used for our visualization work and relates some of our experiences in constructing specialized graphical tools. Other areas of discussion include computer codes, free software tools to build interfaces, and tracking and graphical representation of simulated and actual manufacturing process data across networks.

Reference-contexts: As SGI continues to introduce machines on the low-end of the price scale, they will become even more prevalent in government and industry. 3.2 Software development 3.2.1 X11/Motif Most user interfaces in the UNIX environment are constructed from the X11/Motif programming toolkit <ref> [1] </ref>. The X window system is an industry standard system which allows programmers to develop point-and-click graphical interfaces that can be migrated across computer platforms [2]. X is based on a client-server model. The X server handles all input and output devices.

X is based on a client-server model. The X server handles all input and output devices. A client is an application that uses the devices provided by the server. X supports many network protocols which allows the server and client to run on separate computers.

Reference-contexts: OpenGL also is based on a client-server model. The code running which issues OpenGL commands is known as the client. The computer that performs the drawing is known as the server. If there is only one computer performing both tasks, then it is both the client and the server <ref> [3] </ref>. OpenGL 3 is hardware independent, but it is closely tied to the operating system and the graphics hardware. Just as Motif seeks to simplify programming in X, so to does Open Inventor seek to simply programming in OpenGL. Open Inventor is an object-oriented 3D toolkit [4].

For example, some of the latest aircraft designs must cope with enormous loads. Constructing safe components from lightweight aluminum would render the structure too large or too heavy. Substituting composites for metal makes the design practical.

Reference-contexts: Yet another is the ability to incorporate "in-situ" sensors into a composite part. These sensors can be used for many purposes. One use is in the actual manufacturing process <ref> [9] </ref>. Sensors placed in the fiber preform can be monitored during the resin filling stage to monitor the resin flow front. As resin hits the sensors, they can in turn relay this information to a controlling device. This presents a framework for intelligent processing.

Reference-contexts: We are currently investigating tools constructed in Open Inventor that will let us visualize the flow front through a cross section of the thick composite section. Sensor visualization is also being augmented with a resin flow front reconstruction algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. Currently, the capability exists to visualize sensor activity. Off-line capability has been developed to reconstruct the resin flow front based on time and sensor data. The result is a sophisticated curve fitting approach to determine the resin flow front 9 at discrete time intervals.
