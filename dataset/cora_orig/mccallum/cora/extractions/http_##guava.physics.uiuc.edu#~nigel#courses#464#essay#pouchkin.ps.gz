Title: Wetting Transition  
Author: Dmitri Pouchkin 
Date: May 5, 1998  
Abstract: In the presence of a wall a binary mixture may exibit a new phase transition, the wetting transition. We start with the analysis of dew (a liquid drop on a surface), discuss the mean field theory describing its equilibrium, observe phase transitions of the first and second order, mention impurities and long-ranged van der Waals forces, note the physical equivalence of dew to magnetic domain, report that we live in the upper critical dimension, and consider an unusual critical exponent, continuously depending on the dew's parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 The wetting transition (Here we follow closely a review of P.G. de Gennes <ref> [1] </ref>) A liquid/vapor interface L/V, in the vicinity of a solid S may exibit either a finite equilibrium contact angle e (partial wetting) or a strictly vanishing contact angle (complete wetting). There may exist a particular temperature T w at which we switch from one regime to the other. <p> The transition temperature is shifted to a lower value and the transition becomes of the first order. Long range forces can also induce a flourishing variety of transition phenomena. Quite a few of them are described and referenced at the review of de Gennes <ref> [1] </ref>. I 6 would like to mention two of them. It is incorrect to assume exponential tail for the L/V interface when the interactions between molecules in the fluid become long range. The (r) 2 expansion in (8) becomes invalid. <p> It is also a must to mention the dramatic effects that chemical contaminations may have on the wetting phenomena (for references see, again, <ref> [1] </ref>). 6 Second order transition: detailed discussion. The domain of validity of mean field theory. The upper critical dimension. Correlations. Gaussian fluctuations. Critical exponents. Here we will discuss the domain of validity of mean field theory describing the critical wetting.

Reference-contexts: It turns out, that in such case, the interfacial energy vary considerably when we consider the broad vicinity of T c (typically a 30 ffi interval). This makes experimentation much simpler. Two typical examples of the wetting transition have been observed by Pohl and Goldburg (1982) <ref> [2] </ref> and Moldover and Schmidt (1983) [3]. The former considered a system of two liquid phases (A,B) (litidine water mixtures) against common glass (S). The technique is based on capillary rise and allows for a plot of cos e as a function of temperature.

Reference-contexts: Large positive values of S favour the spreading of a liquid. 3 The Cahn model. Mean field theory. The theoretical description of wetting transition was proposed by Cahn in 1977 <ref> [4] </ref>. We will follow his arguments. (a) The liquid-solid interface can be described by the continous liquid number density (z) which varies smoothly as a function of distance z from the wall. This seems to be most adequate at temperatures close to T c .

Reference-contexts: If we take (z) = ((z); T ) (7) (as was done by number of autors <ref> [6] </ref>), the minimisation of energy will lead to a density profile that is a step function at all temperatures, and to vanishing of the surface tension.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting that the theory was given such a form already by van der Waals [7] (1893), Landau and Lifshitz's theory of magnetic domain (1935) <ref> [8] </ref> is equivalent, and the theory has been reformulated and extended by Cahn and Hillard (1958) [9]. In the simplest version of the theory is given by (z) = 2 dz + W (; T ) (8) see, e.g. [10].

Reference-contexts: However in certain situations long-ranged forces mainly van der Waals forces (VW) for organic liquids or double layer forces for water become relevant. Consider a liquid film of thickness dzeta covering a solid. When its thickness is large, VW term may become dominant. Then agonist VW forces (see, e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>) bear repulsive energy and tend to thicken the film. A possible situation is sketched at figure 7. When VW terms gives an energy equal to that of macroscopic film fl sv , the system jumps by a first order transition from the = 1 to = 1 .

Reference-contexts: It is incorrect to assume exponential tail for the L/V interface when the interactions between molecules in the fluid become long range. The (r) 2 expansion in (8) becomes invalid. What happens when it breaks down? A first attempt to answer this question is due to Sullivan (1979) <ref> [12] </ref>. He chose a pair interaction U (r ij ) = 4r ij and the solid/molecule interaction within the same range fl 1 1 , Sullivan found a simple solution of complete integral mean-field equation for this special choice without assuming a "gradient square" expansion. He obtained some interesting results.

Reference-contexts: The standard procedure <ref> [13] </ref> gives a correlation length in directions parallel to the wall: ~ jj = (T w T ) This interesting result is in contrast with the usual - = 1=2 mean field law. <p> invarience is responsible for the interaction of nonsingular modes which modifies the self-coupling (or effective interactions) of the long-wave modes and these effective interactions vanish as (T w T ) 2 ! As a consequence the upper critical dimension is three, i.e. a three-dimensional bulk liquid with a two-dimensional interface <ref> [13] </ref>. (A naive calculation taking into account the singular modes only would lead to a conclusion that the upper critical dimension is five!) Therefore one would expect corrections to the above mean field theory results sufficiently close to T w .

Reference-contexts: Its analysis gave a rise to a very unusual critial exponent, whose value depends continuously on the parameter ! = k B T w =4~ 2 b fl (where ~ b is the bulk correlation length ) <ref> [14] </ref>.
