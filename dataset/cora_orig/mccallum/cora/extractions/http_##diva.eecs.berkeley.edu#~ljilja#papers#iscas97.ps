Abstract: A transistor network consisting of linear positive resistors, q exponential diodes, and p Ebers-Moll model bipolar transistors has at most (d+1) d 2 d(d1)=2 dc operating points, where d = q+2p. Bounds are also obtained for the number of operating points in circuits using other models for bipolar transistors.

Reference-contexts: The simplest model for a bipolar transistor is the Ebers-Moll model, which uses the exponential form. Piecewise-linear functions have often been used to approximate nonlinear resistors, see <ref> [1, p. 76] </ref>. For exponential functions we obtain an upper bound using the following result of Khovanskii [6], [8, p. 12]. <p> For example, the "decoupled" pair of equations e x 1 2x 1 1 = 0 has 4 real solutions. We do not know if there exist such systems having 5 or 6 real solutions. We now consider circuits with piecewise-linear modeled bipolar transistors <ref> [1] </ref>. In the piecewise-linear case there is very simple upper bound for the number of solutions. The bound does not assume monotonicity of the diode functions f i (x i ), nor that f i (0) = 0. Theorem 3.

Reference-contexts: We consider the problem of estimating upper bounds for the number of operating points of circuits consisting of linear positive resistors, exponential diodes, and Ebers-Moll modeled <ref> [2] </ref> bipolar transistors. (Inductors and capacitors do not play a role in establishing a circuit's dc operating point and can be removed from the circuits by being short-circuited and open-circuited, respectively.)

The Ebers-Moll model <ref> [2] </ref> for a bipolar junction transistor consists of two nonlinear exponential diodes described by (4) in which m i n i &gt; 0 and m i &gt; 0 for a pnp transistor, and m i &lt; 0 for an npn transistor. <p> The necessary and sufficient conditions for an Ebers-Moll model bipolar transistor to possess the no-gain property [16] are: m i+1 1=ff i The Ebers-Moll model parameters also satisfy the reciprocity condition <ref> [2] </ref> m i ff i = m i+1 ff i+1 : (9) 3.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved by absorbing the constant terms in the nonlinear diodes (4) in the Ebers-Moll model into the constant term c in (15). Theorem 2 also applies to circuit equations with Gummel-Poon transistor models <ref> [3] </ref>, [5]. In the Gummel-Poon model additional functional dependence of the emitter and collector currents on the "base charge" is introduced. This dependence manifests itself in the transistor currents now being sums of exponential functions with three distinct exponents.

Reference-contexts: The model parameters m i ; n i for 1 i 2p are also required to satisfy the passivity, no-gain, and reciprocity conditions given below.

Such models arise when approximating exponential functions in the Gummel-Poon model <ref> [5] </ref> over certain ranges of voltages where some exponential terms become negligible. 4. Concluding Remarks The upper bounds stated in Section 2 depend on the particular form assumed for the nonlinear functions f i (x). This is unavoidable.

See <ref> [7] </ref>, p. 12 and Chapters 2 and 3. 2 The proof method of Khovanskii has inefficiencies which suggest that the bound (14) may not be the right order of magnitude in its dependence on d.

Reference-contexts: number of operating points of circuits consisting of linear positive resistors, exponential diodes, and Ebers-Moll modeled [2] bipolar transistors. (Inductors and capacitors do not play a role in establishing a circuit's dc operating point and can be removed from the circuits by being short-circuited and open-circuited, respectively.) Lee and Willson <ref> [8] </ref> showed that a circuit containing two transistors possesses at most three dc operating points. There exist networks with p transistors that have 2 p 1 dc operating points [17].

Piecewise-linear functions have often been used to approximate nonlinear resistors, see [1, p. 76]. For exponential functions we obtain an upper bound using the following result of Khovanskii [6], <ref> [8, p. 12] </ref>. <p> For example, it is known that the circuit equations in Sandberg-Willson form (2) for a circuit having at most two transistors (d = 4; p = 2; q = 0) have at most three isolated real zeros, see Lee and Willson <ref> [8] </ref>. However, one can find equations of the form of Theorem 1 for d = 4 that have 16 isolated real zeros.

Reference-contexts: However, one can find equations of the form of Theorem 1 for d = 4 that have 16 isolated real zeros. Nishi and Kawane <ref> [9] </ref> present an interesting alternate approach to obtaining upper bounds for the number of solutions of network equations for nonlinear resistive circuit by assuming that the circuit elements satisfy monotone sign conditions on derivatives such as df i (x) dx &gt; 0, or a convexity con dition like d 2 f

Reference-contexts: We note that to obtain finite upper bounds on dc operating points, it is necessary to make assumptions on the vi response curves of nonlinear diodes used in the circuits, because there are examples of circuits having infinitely many operating points, due to Nishi <ref> [10] </ref>. The bounds we do obtain are, however, very likely far from best possible for the circuits to which they apply. <p> Allowing small perturbations around a "nice" function does not eliminate such examples. For example, for any * &gt; 0 the system f (x) 2x *=4 = 0 ; (25) with f (x) = 2x + * sin x, has infinitely many real solutions. Nishi <ref> [10] </ref> recently reported that transistor circuits may possess infinitely many solutions in some cases where the diode characteristics have positive first and second derivatives, i.e., are increasing convex functions. <p> It seems reasonable to allow only perturbations that preserve the sign of the first two derivatives. However, in view of the Nishi example <ref> [10] </ref>, one still must put additional conditions on the matrices A; B and vector c in (10) to rule out infinitely many solutions. <p> They announce an upper bound of 2 d operating points for systems (10) under such extra hypotheses. However, their arguments appear to be incomplete, even for d = 2. The example of Nishi <ref> [10] </ref> shows that the situation is delicate.

Reference-contexts: However, it can be shown that for d = 2 there can be at most 6 real solutions. (The argument, due to Poonen <ref> [11] </ref>, is complicated and we omit it.) There are simple examples of this type having 4 real zeros. For example, the "decoupled" pair of equations e x 1 2x 1 1 = 0 has 4 real solutions.

Reference-contexts: A circuit's operating points are solutions of a system of nonlinear equations F (x) = 0: (1) We present explicit upper bounds for the number of isolated zeros of such systems when circuit equations are of Sandberg-Willson form <ref> [12] </ref>, under suitable assumptions on v i response functions of nonlinear diodes. By applying Theorem 1 given below, we obtain the upper bound (d + 1) d 2 d (d1)=2 for a system of network equations with q exponential diodes and p Ebers-Moll model transistors, where d = q +2p.
