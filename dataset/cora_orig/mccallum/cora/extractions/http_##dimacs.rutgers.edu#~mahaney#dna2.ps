Abstract: Preliminary analyses of Adleman's technique for solving Hamiltonian path based on reaction rates and concentrations are sobering. These issues are not objections to biological computing per se, but rather difficulties to be overcome in its development as a viable technology.

Reference-contexts: 1 Reaction Rates We assume familiarity with Adleman's DNA-based technique <ref> [Adl94] </ref> for solving the hamiltonian path problem. For the present analysis, we will consider the hamiltonian path problem on directed graphs, rather than graphs. 1.1 An Easy Case We begin by considering a very simple family of directed graphs, the line digraphs.

Reference-contexts: Reaction rate issues are even more damaging for techniques that attempt to use exponentially many reaction families, such as the algorithms for solving arbitrary PSPACE problems proposed by Beaver <ref> [Bea95] </ref> and Roo-Wagner [RW95]. Although the vision of exponentially many reactions taking place in polynomially many parallel steps is very attractive, it is now all too clear that each of these parallel reaction steps requires exponential time. An exponential loss of concentration seems to affect all DNA based algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the energy requirements of such a system will need to be accounted for|especially at the separation vesicles where a decrease in entropy occurs. 4.2 CNA The microstructure we discussed in Section 4.1 was first developed for an alternative model of biological computing based on protein synthesis <ref> [KMRS96] </ref>. CNA-based computing has some significant advantages and disadvantages with respect to DNA-based computing.
