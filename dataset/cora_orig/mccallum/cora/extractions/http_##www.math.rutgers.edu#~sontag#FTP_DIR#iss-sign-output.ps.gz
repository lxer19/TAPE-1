Abstract: This paper considers the problem of stabilization of linear systems for which only the magnitudes of outputs are measured. It is shown that, if a system is controllable and observable, then one can find a stabilizing controller, which is robust with respect to observation noise (in the ISS sense).

Reference-contexts: In [12], necessary and sufficient (but, except for certain special cases, cf. [13], hard to check) conditions for dynamic output 2 regulation were obtained. The problem is one of great interest; some recent references are <ref> [1, 2, 3, 9, 18] </ref>.) In addition, when stabilizing nonlinear systems, the effect of disturbances on actuators and/or on measurements cannot be disregarded in the design. For linear systems, small or bounded disturbances produce small or bounded steady state errors, if stability of the undisturbed system holds.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, disturbances on measurements can lead to serious instability, and one of the most interesting open problems in nonlinear control theory concerns the formulation of output controllers which are robust, in an ISS sense, with respect to disturbances. In a remarkable contribution, Randy Freeman produced in <ref> [4] </ref> a counterexample showing that it is in general impossible to stabilize, using a state feedback, a simple system with state measurements _x = f (x; u), y = x (h is the identity), if ISS behavior with respect to disturbances is required, that is, a feedback law k () such <p> The challenge now is to understand how general this situation (existence of dynamic controllers providing ISS with respect to disturbances) is, and to see how explicit the constructions can be made. As noted in [5], some of the most important features of the counterexample in <ref> [4] </ref> are captured by the study of ISS design for linear systems "with positive noisy outputs" _x = Ax + Bu, y = jCx + dj, which are the subject of the present work.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Freeman showed in <ref> [5] </ref> that, for his example, a dynamic (time-varying) controller can be used to obtain ISS behavior in this sense.

Reference-contexts: Linear systems with positive outputs are a particular class of "constrained output linear systems" in the sense of <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 Main Construction The controller to be designed is a time-varying sampled-data scheme which in the absence of disturbances produces a dead-beat response. It acts by cycling through four basic steps or "modes", each of the same duration and proportional to the dimension n of the system: 1.

Reference-contexts: As for related work, we remark that the controllers presented here are somewhat similar to the stabilizers designed for linear systems with output saturating nonlinearity in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we remark that questions of robustness with respect to noise, even for small noise levels (not ISS behavior, which considers arbitrary magnitudes), leads to extremely interesting theoretical questions; see for instance <ref> [8] </ref>. Linear systems with positive outputs are a particular class of "constrained output linear systems" in the sense of [6]. 2 Main Construction The controller to be designed is a time-varying sampled-data scheme which in the absence of disturbances produces a dead-beat response.

Reference-contexts: Disturbances on actuators are somewhat easier to handle than those on measurements: while a controller, even a feedback-linearizing one, can easily become unstable in the presence of actuator noise, the paper <ref> [14] </ref> showed how a simple feedback redesign can render the closed-loop system ISS.

Reference-contexts: Remark 1 In order to keep the formalism as simple as possible, we have chosen not to define precisely the general meaning of "controller" and "closed-loop behavior". One may define these concepts in general, see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref>, and it will be clear from our constructions how one could represent our controller as a dynamic (n-dimensional, in fact) time-periodic discrete-time system which operates on the continuous-time system (2) by means of sample and hold.

Reference-contexts: There are many equivalent definitions of ISS for continuous-time systems, and several of the equivalences are highly nontrivial, cf. <ref> [17] </ref>. However, when applied to a closed-loop system in which the controller is dynamic (has memory) and operates in a sample-and-hold mode, as we will do here, the definitions are not necessarily equivalent anymore.
