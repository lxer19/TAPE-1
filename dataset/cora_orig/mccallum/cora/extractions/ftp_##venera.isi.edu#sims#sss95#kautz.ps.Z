Title: Agent Amplified Communication  
Author: Henry Kautz, Al Milewski, and Bart Selman

Abstract: We propose an agent-based framework for assisting and simplifying person-to-person communication for information gathering tasks. As an example, we focus on expertise location within a large organization. In our approach, the informal person-to-person networks that exist within an organization are used to referral chain requests for expertise. User-agents are employed to automate the referral chaining process. We also present simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: We are designing and building systems that use software agents to assist and simplify person-to-person communication for information gathering tasks; we call this approach agent amplified communication. Expertise Location In a previous paper <ref> (Kautz et al. 1994) </ref>, we described our view of software agents and the particular agent platform we had built. We take agents to be programs that assist users in routine, communication intensive activities, such as locating information, scheduling meetings, coordinating paper reviews, and so on. <p> Implementation of an Expertise Locator An initial version the expertise location has been implemented by extending the user-agents as developed in our earlier visitorbot project <ref> (Kautz et al. 1994) </ref>. Each user-agent has access to the following kinds of database files, each of which is specific to and owned by the individual user.

Reference-contexts: We obtain a success rate of around 27%, with about 10 messages per request. So, with relatively accurate, but not perfect, referral, we still need only a few messages to get reasonably successful referral chaining. This is consistent with the observed effectiveness of the referral process in real organizations <ref> (Krackhardt and Hanson 1993) </ref>. In general, our simulation experiments suggest that a decrease in referral accuracy can be compensated for by having a somewhat higher responsiveness. The plot in Fig. 1 gives the success rate as a function of the responsiveness and referral accuracy.
