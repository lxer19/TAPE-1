Reference-contexts: That is to say, subjects' improved performance under one specific stimulus condition (e.g., a two-line Vernier display in horizontal orientation) does not readily transfer to another stimulus condition (e.g., the same Vernier in vertical orientation <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: That is to say, subjects' improved performance under one specific stimulus condition (e.g., a two-line Vernier display in horizontal orientation) does not readily transfer to another stimulus condition (e.g., the same Vernier in vertical orientation [1]). Other examples include, to name just a few (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a recent review), orientation in stereopsis discrimination [3], orientation and spatial frequency in waveform discrimination [4], and direction in motion discrimination [5]. 2 Often is this specificity interpretated as resulting from the underlying char-acteristic neurons, whose selective tuning (e.g., selectivity for orientation, spatial frequency, or motion direction) is responsible

Reference-contexts: We propose here that perceptual learning is "learning statistical properties from the stimulus ensemble". More specifically, subjects' increased sensitivity after repeated trials is directed toward some specific aspects of the stimulus in the experiments <ref> [6] </ref>. It is therefore not surprising that the improvement under one specific stimulus condition does not carry over to a novel stimulus that is unlikely a sample from the previous stimulus ensemble. In other words, stimulus specific experiments could have contributed to the stimulus specificity in perceptual learning.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, when the experimental conditions were appropriate, a transfer was evidenced | an ecologically reasonable constraint not emphasized by previous perceptual learning studies (but see <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref>). Although the result was obtained in a case study of motion direction discrimination, it is our belief that it implies to a great variety of perceptual learning in general. An immediate question following our case study is what is being learned.
