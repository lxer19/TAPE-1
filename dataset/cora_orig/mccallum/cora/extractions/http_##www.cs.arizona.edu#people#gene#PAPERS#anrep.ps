Title: A System for Pattern Matching Applications on Biosequences  
Author: Gerhard Mehldau and Gene Myers* 
Abstract: ANREP is a system for finding matches to patterns composed of (1) spacing constraints called ``spacers'', and (2) approximate matches to ``motifs'' that are, recursively, patterns composed of ``atomic'' symbols. A user specifies such patterns via a declarative, free-format, and strongly typed language called A that is presented here in a tutorial style through a series of progressively more complex examples. The sample patterns are for protein and DNA sequences, the application domain for which ANREP was specifically created. ANREP provides a unified framework for almost all previously proposed biosequence patterns and extends them by providing approximate matching, a feature heretofore unavailable except for the limited case of individual sequences. The performance of ANREP is discussed and an appendix gives a concise specification of syntax and semantics. A portable C software package implementing ANREP is available via anonymous remote file transfer.

Reference-contexts: The patterns are communicated to the system in a small language called A . ANREP extends previous work by providing a unified framework for concepts found in isolation in earlier systems: QUEST <ref> (Abarbanel et al., 1984) </ref>, a system for specifying character patterns built around exact matching of regular expressions, Staden's software (1988), that allows for the logical combination of sequence similarities via a list of spatial constraints; and the package by Gribskov et al. (1988), that computes and analyzes profiles that are positionally

Reference-contexts: The string transferred must be null-terminated. The software currently embodying this simple interface should suffice as an example to the programmer who wants to extend or alter the available formats. For example, GENBANK (Burks et al., 1991), EMBL (Stoehr and Cameron, 1991), PIR (Barker et al., 1991), and PRO-SITE <ref> (Bairoch, 1991) </ref> formats could all be added as desired. Simple Patterns ANREP 's central function is to search a database file for instances of user defined patterns, called networks. A network is a network expression of motif /threshold pairs and spacers.

Reference-contexts: In particular, ANREP determines that the entry is exhausted when this routine transfers zero characters. The string transferred must be null-terminated.

Reference-contexts: ANREP's positional weighting feature generalizes the capability embodied in Gribskov's profile analysis software <ref> (Gribskov et al., 1988) </ref>. The language A is free-format, declarative, and strongly typed. It permits patterns to be hierarchically defined and parameterized, supports the development of pattern libraries, and provides both enumerative and functional mechanisms for specifying scoring schemes.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In this paper we present a prototype system, ANREP , for defining and searching for a class of patterns that should facilitate research into patterns ranging from relatively simple descriptions of promotors <ref> (Hawley and McClure, 1983) </ref> and zinc fingers (Miller et al., 1985), to more complex patterns, such as those recently posed for cytosine methyltransferases (Posfai et al., 1989) and a-hemoglobins (Barton and Sternberg, 1990).

Reference-contexts: ANREP currently comprehends two very simple formats for files that are to be searched. The first is a plain file format where the file is assumed to be just a sequence of characters. The second is the Lipman/Pearson FASTA format <ref> (Lipman and Pearson, 1985) </ref> where the file is assumed to be a series of header/sequence pairs. A header is a consecutive sequence of lines whose first character is &gt; and the sequence associated with that header is the subsequent lines to the next header.

Reference-contexts: But there is also the possibility of having an atom whose alignment scores are tailored specifically for it, or are some admixture of the schema scores for a set of symbols. ANREP provides such a capability in the form of consensus symbols that effectively generalize Staden's weight matrix concept <ref> (Staden, 1988) </ref>. Furthermore, the fact that motif matching is based on alignment scores also provides an opportunity to value some portions of a match as being more important than others, i.e., one can positionally weight various parts of a motif.
