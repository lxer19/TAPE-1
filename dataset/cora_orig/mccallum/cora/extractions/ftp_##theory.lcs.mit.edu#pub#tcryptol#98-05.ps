Abstract: Recent works by Ajtai and by Ajtai and Dwork bring to light the old (general) question of whether it is at all possible to base the security of cryptosystems on the assumption that P 6= N P. We discuss this question and in particular review and extend a two-decade old result of Brassard regarding this question. Our conclusion is that the question remains open.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the following is an important open problem. Open Problem: Can one construct a secure encryption scheme based on the assumption that P 6= N P? This question is experiencing a rebirth in light of recent attempts to proceed towards this goal. In a pioneering work <ref> [1] </ref>, Ajtai has constructed a one-way function assuming that the Shortest Vector Problem is hard to approximate to within a factor of n c (in worst case), where c &gt; 11 and n denotes the dimention. 2 The fundamental aspect of Ajtai's work, is the reduction of a (non-parametrized) worst-case problem

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the Shortest Vector Problem has been recently shown by Ajtai <ref> [2] </ref> to be NP-Hard (under randomized reductions).

We mention that probabilistic encryption is essential to security as defined in [12]. Thus, Brassard's Claim does not rule out the possibility of "basing cryptography" (or even public-key encryption) on the assumption that P 6= N P (even if N P 6= coN P, as we do believe). <p> Consequently, Ajtai and Dwork <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a public-key encryption scheme whose security is reduced to the Unique Shortest Vector Problem, where uniqueness is again upto a large polynomail in the dimention. Interestingly, the trapdoor permutation suggested in [11] relies on the conjectured difficulty of the Closest Vector Problem.

Reference-contexts: answer to the above Open Problem. 1 In our discussion, we ignore the known fact that worst-case hardness of retrieving the plaintext is an inadequate (i.e., much too weak) notion of security of encryption schemes. 2 The constant has been recently reduced to c &gt; 5 by Cai and Nerurkar <ref> [8] </ref>. 1 2 Background | Promise problems and smart reductions A promise problem [9] is a pair of disjoint subsets of f0; 1g fl . The first subset represents yes-instances, the second no-instances, and their union is called the promise.

The first subset represents yes-instances, the second no-instances, and their union is called the promise. Thus, the standard decision problem for a language L f0; 1g fl can be casted as a promise problem (L; L). <p> As explained in <ref> [9] </ref> (see also [10]), the fact that a promise problem in N P " coN P (resp., AM " coAM) is NP-hard via arbitrary Cook reductions does not seem to imply that N P = coN P (resp., coN P AM). <p> Otherwise the reduction is called non-smart. 3 We note that any many-to-one/Karp (possibly randomized) reduction is smart. On the other hand, Even et. al. used a non-smart reduction when presenting an NP-hard promise problem in N P " coN P (cf. <ref> [9, Thm. 4] </ref>). Their usage of a non-smart reduction seems essential in light of the result of Grollmann and Selman proved [13, Thm. 2] reproduced next. <p> The condition in Item 2 relaxes the condition in Brassard's Claim. The condition in Item 1 makes further relaxation but also imposes a (quite limiting) restriction on the reduction. The fact that Item 2 implies N P = coN P is actually a special case of <ref> [9, Thm. 6] </ref>. (We stress again that none of the items provides an adequate notion of security, as both refer to the worst-case complexity of distinguishing E e (0) from E e (1), rather to an average case complexity.) Proof: In Item 1 we follow the structure of the proof of

Reference-contexts: Even more recently, Micciancio [14] has proven that it is NP-Hard (again under randomized reductions) to approximate the Shortest Vector Problem to within any constant factor smaller than p 2. The approximation factors mentioned in the above two types of results are very far apart, and our own work <ref> [10] </ref> points out difficulties in trying to bridge the gap. Still, the above effords renew the interest in the Open Problem (as a negative answer to the latter deems these efforts to be futile). In this note we present some extensions of Brassard's Claim. <p> As explained in [9] (see also <ref> [10] </ref>), the fact that a promise problem in N P " coN P (resp., AM " coAM) is NP-hard via arbitrary Cook reductions does not seem to imply that N P = coN P (resp., coN P AM).
