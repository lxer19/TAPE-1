Abstract: The process of change and development of technology in a country depends on the external and internal factors. In fact, the entire chain of values within a nation with high levels of living standards and industrialisation cannot be the same as those of a developing nation struggling for its basic needs. This means that innovation theories and related approaches which are more suitable to industrialised nations, are not appropriate for the conditions of developing countries. Therefore, there is a need to concentrate on the realm of technology transfer. The use of technology transfer as a convenient term for the dynamic process of technical/technological change in less developed countries should be set down in a specific conceptual framework in order to establish a relevant approach for technology management and development in the Third World. In this paper after a consideration of the fundamental concepts of technological change and innovation in advanced countries, an attempt has been made to understand the process of technological change within the socioeconomic systems of developing countries. The main objective of this paper is providing suitable conceptual basis enabling us to establish an appropriate approach for technological change through technology transfer.

But due to the lack of the prerequisites of the former in developing countries, these nations are generally limited to the latter.

Reference-contexts: Most developing (particularly poor) countries do not possess a thoroughgoing innovative capacity. In fact, many of them do not even have the critical minimum levels of skills necessary to successfully operate the production facilities already in place <ref> [17] </ref>. Through this brief consideration, we argue that due to existing conditions in developed countries, the interdependency of economic and technological levels with innovation activities is very close. In contrast, for developing countries, imitation is the most important factor in maintaining this dependency.

Actually, expatriate technical assistance specialists overlook the fact that appropriate assistance in many cases involves improving the distribution of information about existing products, processes, techniques and materials.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, there is a need to concentrate on the realm of technology transfer. In recent years, the interest in processes and activities that generate technical change in industrialised countries has been renewed. These activities have been set down as a central feature of the new trade and growth theories <ref> [i.e. 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, 23, 30, 39] </ref>. In developing countries, on the other hand, as many scholars [ i.e. 3, 10, 15, 21, 25, 26, 27] argue, we can see considerable variation in efficiency and generation of different technologies.

Reference-contexts: Many studies demonstrate empirically this concept [i.e. 1, 7, 8, 9, developed countries <ref> [40] </ref>. But due to the nature of technological acquisition through importing technology and the lack of prerequisite conditions for such relationships within the production systems of developing countries, they cannot normally reproduce the same kind of mechanism of the innovation process.

Reference-contexts: So, particularly since the Second World War, technological challenge and technology transfer in these areas does, mostly, mean technological innovation. By this, we mean the entire process from R&D in the laboratory to successful commercialisation in the marketplace <ref> [41] </ref>. Innovation, Technological Change and Development It is necessary to distinguish between the concepts of the innovation process in industrialised nations and of the technology transfer process for developing countries as two different approaches.
