Abstract: We give estimation error bounds and specify optimal estimators for continuous, closed boundary curves in an NMR image. The boundary is parameterized using periodic B-Splines. A Cramer-Rao lower bound on mean-square-estimate error in the presence of system smoothing and Gaussian noise is derived, and the performance of maximum likelihood and penalized maximum likelihood estimators is compared to this bound. Finally, we comment on the usefulness of estimates of the boundary for providing anatomical side information in the reconstruction of functional tomographic images like those of a PET or SPECT system.

Reference-contexts: Recently it has been suggested that the use of anatomical boundaries taken from NMR images might improve the quality of functional tomographic image reconstructions [3],[4], <ref> [5] </ref>. Many organ and tumor boundaries are continuous, smooth curves that are well-suited to spline approximation. In this paper, we examine the performance of both the maximum likelihood (ML) and a penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimator with respect to the Cramer-Rao lower bound on estimator mean squared error.
