Abstract: Multilingual generation in machine translation (MT) requires a knowledge organization that facilitates the task of lexical choice, i.e., selection of lexical units to be used in the generation of a target-language sentence. This paper investigates the extent to which lexicalization patterns involving the lexical aspect feature [+telic] (`having an inherent end' as in win vs. run) may be used for translating events and states among languages. The work reported here is part of an ongoing effort to build a computational model that characterizes knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface [18, 37, 38, 39, 65, 66]. Telicity has been correlated syntactically with both transitivity [65, 66, 69] and unaccusativity [38, 39], and semantically with Talmy's `path' of a motion event [62, 63, 64], the representation of which characterizes languages parametrically. Taking as our starting point the syntactic/semantic classification in Levin's English Verb Classes and Alternations [37], we examine the relation between telic-ity and the syntactic contexts, or alternations outlined in this work, identifying systematic relations between the lexical aspect features and the semantic components that potentiate these alternations. Representing lexical aspect|particularly telicity|is therefore crucial for the tasks of lexical choice and syntactic realization. Having enriched the data in [37] (by correlating the syntactic alternations (Part I) and semantic verb classes (Part II) and marking them for telicity) we assign to verbs lexical semantic templates (LSTs). We then demonstrate that it is possible from these templates to build a large-scale repository for lexical conceptual structures (LCSs)|in the spirit of a number of researchers [20, 27, 31, 32, 38, 39]| which encode meaning components that correspond to different values of the telicity feature. The LST framework preserves both semantic content and semantic structure (following Grimshaw [24]) during the processes of lexical choice and syntactic realization. Application of this model identifies precisely where the Knowledge Representation (KR) component may profitably augment our rules of composition, to identify cases where the IL underlying the SL sentence must be either reduced or modified in order to produce an appropriate TL sentence.

Reference-contexts: The work reported here is part of an ongoing effort to build a computational model that characterizes knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface <ref> [18, 37, 38, 39, 65, 66] </ref>, taking into account the requirements of the translation task. We aim to identify the linguistically relevant properties of predicate meaning that may be used in a translation interlingua (language-independent representation) and proposed as candidates for linguistic universals. <p> This repository, which is hierarchically organized, serves as the basis of a lexical-choice module of a MT system <ref> [15, 17, 18, 19] </ref>.

Section 3 defines a mapping between Levin's 84 syntactic alternations and the [+telic] feature. <p> In addition, for the purpose of this discussion, we restrict our attention to non-stative verbs. States, however, are also allowed through the use of the BE primitive. 25 These templates are a refined version of the ones presented by Dorr and Voss <ref> [18] </ref>; certain modifications have been made in accordance with our telicity results, e.g., elimination of simultaneously occurring path and means/manner constituents as well as removal of CAUSE from atelic templates. final-final-lex-choice.tex; 29/05/1996; 0:25; no v.; p.23 24 B. Dorr and M. <p> Additional Guidance for Lexical Choice: KR The entire representational framework outlined above is designed to integrate with a KR-based processing module described in <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> The KR-based module provides additional guidance by determining the range of TL lexical items that can "cover" the full IL form using a constrained search mechanism. Each SL and TL lexicon is tied into a larger "lexicalization space" called the IL Lexicon. Following the design in <ref> [18] </ref>, the IL Lexicon provides two types of links, shown in Figure 3: (1) a reduction link (dotted arrow), which relates a causative form to its non-causative counterpart; (2) a sub-sumption link (solid arrow), which relates a lexical IL form to its more specific counterpart. <p> We will look at a more complicated case shortly, i.e., one where lexical items are not precisely lined up between English and Spanish. The process of lexical choice uses an augmented version of the lexicalization space in <ref> [18] </ref>, where reduction links cross the line between atelic and telic verbs as illustrated in Figure 4. The main augmentation to the original IL Lexicon framework is that reduction links are now allowed to refer to either of the two argument positions in a causative (telic) template. <p> The benefit of using the reduction links for resolving both argument positions is that the same navigation algorithm (out final-final-lex-choice.tex; 29/05/1996; 0:25; no v.; p.33 34 B. Dorr and M. Olsen lined in <ref> [18] </ref>) may be used for selection and realization of appropriate TL lexical items across telicity categories. <p> We have augmented this database with LCS representations for 3500 verbs not occurring in Levin by associating with each verb a semantic class and then instantiating the relevant LCS template. 33 The full set of LCSs is being used in a large-scale analysis component for a MT system <ref> [15, 17, 18] </ref>. A prototype version of the generation component has been constructed for complete end-to-end translation [19]. During analysis, the appropriate LCSs in the SL are selected as a function of syntax, and the IL constructed compositionally from the semantic structure and constant information therein.

Reference-contexts: This paper focuses on the 2 B. Dorr and M. Olsen development of a theory of lexical choice|particularly for the task of MT|for verbs and their arguments in multiple languages. We use the syntactic contexts, or alternations , and semantic classes in <ref> [37] </ref> to lay a foundation for exploiting lexicalization patterns [62, 64] in translating situations (events or states) among languages. <p> The work reported here is part of an ongoing effort to build a computational model that characterizes knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface <ref> [18, 37, 38, 39, 65, 66] </ref>, taking into account the requirements of the translation task. We aim to identify the linguistically relevant properties of predicate meaning that may be used in a translation interlingua (language-independent representation) and proposed as candidates for linguistic universals. <p> We take as our starting point the syntactic/semantic classification in Levin's English Verb Classes and Alternations <ref> [37] </ref>. We examine the relation between the [+telic] feature and the syntactic contexts, or alternations , outlined in this work, identifying alternations that indicate (a)telicity or have a telicizing effect on the relevant verbs. <p> Consider the Wipe Alternation <ref> [37, p. 53] </ref>, where an activity verb (sweep) is used to represent both an activity (marked [+dynamic, +durative]) and an accomplishment (marked [+dynamic, +durative, +telic]): (2) 2.3.3 Wipe Alternation: A. John swept the driveway. ACTIVITY B. John swept the leaves off the driveway. <p> It remains to be seen, however, whether lexical aspect is indeed orthogonal to other lexical semantic properties. Since differences in lexical aspect condition different behavior in syntactic frames, lexical aspect features|in particular, telicity|appear to be among the semantic properties on which the alternations catalogued by Levin <ref> [37] </ref> depend. We therefore propose a systematic relation between lexical aspect|in particular, telicity|and these "linguistically ... pertinent aspects of verb meaning" [37, p. 1]. As in [16], aspect is taken to be a property of interlingual structures of type SITUATION. <p> We therefore propose a systematic relation between lexical aspect|in particular, telicity|and these "linguistically ... pertinent aspects of verb meaning" <ref> [37, p. 1] </ref>. As in [16], aspect is taken to be a property of interlingual structures of type SITUATION. Our approach 4 They may also be interpreted as marked in the appropriate pragmatic context [45, p. 57]. 5 We label as non-basic the construction that the alternation names. <p> Dorr and M. Olsen differs from this work, however, in that we do not consider lexical aspect features to be primitive and independent, but related to|and perhaps derived from|other semantic elements that are represented in the interlingua, particularly change of state. Levin <ref> [37] </ref> hypothesizes that semantically-related verbs share certain syntactic alternations. For example, verbs in the Break semantic class (break, crack, rip, shatter, snap, : : :) participate in the Middle alternation, 6 but not the Conative or Body-Part Possessor Ascension alternations: 7 (3) (i) 1.1.1 Middle: A. She broke the window. <p> She whacked John's collar bone. B. She whacked John on the collar bone. A more detailed investigation reveals that four semantic verb classes are uniquely identified according to their participation (or lack thereof ) in the above three alternations (after <ref> [37, p. 7] </ref>). 6 Although English does not mark the middle voice, the construction in (3)(i)B parallels the "facilitative middle" in languages with such a marking [33, p. 268]. 7 Section numbers (and, in several cases, example sentences) are taken from [37]. <p> lack thereof ) in the above three alternations (after [37, p. 7]). 6 Although English does not mark the middle voice, the construction in (3)(i)B parallels the "facilitative middle" in languages with such a marking [33, p. 268]. 7 Section numbers (and, in several cases, example sentences) are taken from <ref> [37] </ref>. <p> That is, although we know what semantic class a verb belongs to (e.g., using the automatic techniques in [13]), the class does not provide a semantic representation for that verb. As Levin observes <ref> [37, p. 15] </ref>, the task of deciding "what components of verb meaning figure in the relevant generalizations" about syntactic behavior may be undertaken only after one has established "to what extent the meaning of a verb determines its syntactic behavior." Our goal is to identify the underlying meaning components for each <p> We found telicity to be a key distinguishing feature in the characterization of verb meaning in many classes. We have therefore investigated the semantics surrounding the 84 alternations in <ref> [37] </ref>, which apply on the basis of verb class membership. <p> Dorr and M. Olsen for completeness, (v) a small number of alternations that cannot be classified. We use the above categorization to enrich the data in <ref> [37] </ref>, correlating the syntactic alternations (Part I) and semantic verb classes (Part II) and marking them for telicity. We then use this as the basis of assigning to verbs lexical representations which then serve as a foundation for large-scale lexicons. <p> In the approach of Palmer and Wu [48], lexical mismatches are resolved through the use of a conceptual lattice based on an adapted version of the classification in <ref> [37] </ref>. <p> Moreover, the structural-coverage matching scheme is a prerequisite for recursive instantiation of substructures that are not necessarily aligned with the full structure of the interlingua during the translation process. Finally, Levin's classification system <ref> [37] </ref> has been refined in later work [38, 39], where regularities in lexical representations|and the rules that operate on these representations|can be exploited for a more economical approach to MT. Such regularities would be lost if we were to adopt a numerical "closest match" scheme. <p> Olsen well across languages (in the surface syntactic form). By decomposing verbs into predicate structure and non-predicate constants , we exploit such regularities. 3. Relation Between Telicity and Syntactic Alternations This section provides an analysis of verbs and predicates from the alternations and constructions in Part I of <ref> [37] </ref>. In categorizing the alternations, it was first determined whether the verbs undergoing the alternation were a homogeneous class with respect to telicity. The assignment of alternations to categories was based on testing the verbs and classes as positive exemplars of these [37, p. 19]. <p> In categorizing the alternations, it was first determined whether the verbs undergoing the alternation were a homogeneous class with respect to telicity. The assignment of alternations to categories was based on testing the verbs and classes as positive exemplars of these <ref> [37, p. 19] </ref>. Levin illustrates each alternation with representative semantic classes, with indications of acceptability based primarily on intuition (Levin, p.c.). We supplemented these with our own intuitions, adding or eliminating classes or verbs, as noted below. <p> More accurately, we consider verbs with uniform lack of entailments as telic and those with variable behavior as atelic (see [45, p. 12] for discussion). final-final-lex-choice.tex; 29/05/1996; 0:25; no v.; p.10 Multilingual Generation 11 All verbs undergoing this alternation (a subset of the turn verbs listed by Levin <ref> [37] </ref>) are [+telic] according to standard tests such as the following: 12 (10) John was turning DOES NOT ENTAIL John has turned. 3.2. <p> These alternations are classified as adding [+telic]. An example of such a case is the Cognate Object Construction as shown in (11) <ref> [37, pp. 95-96] </ref>, [41]. (11) 7.1 Cognate Object Construction: A. I fought. B. I fought the good fight. Verbs: die, live, sing, smile, tell: : : Several additional alternations are classified as adding [+telic]. Of these, 10 apply uniformly to atelic predicates and may therefore be used as [;telic] diagnostics. <p> Alternations Indicating [;telic] The next telicity category identified the set of alternations that indicate [;telic]. In these cases, both the bare verbs and the verbs in the non-basic variant are uniformly atelic. As an example, consider the With/Against Alternation, with the verbs from <ref> [37] </ref> exhaustively listed: (13) 2.8 With/Against Alternation: A. I hit the fence with the rod. B. I hit the rod against the fence. <p> Jill met (with) Sarah. B. Jill battled (with) Sarah. Verbs: meet verbs: battle, box, consult, debate, fight, meet, play, visit 3.5. Unclassifiable Alternations Two alternations could not be classified, since Levin <ref> [37] </ref> gives only a handful of verbs: (15) Unclassifiable Alternations: 3.2 Natural Force Subject Alternation: dry 3.3 Instrument Subject Alternation: break, eat, load 3.6. <p> As part of this task, final-final-lex-choice.tex; 29/05/1996; 0:25; no v.; p.12 Multilingual Generation 13 we produced a database containing pairings between alternations in Part I and semantic classes in Part II, using as a starting point the publicly available online index from Levin's English Verb Classes and Alternations <ref> [37] </ref>. 13 Since the verbs and classes in Part I are only illustrative of the properties of the relevant alternations, they are not an exhaustive list of the verbs and verb classes participating in the alternations. <p> Similarly, Part II lists only "central properties" <ref> [37, p. 19] </ref> of the verb classes, and does not give all alternations in which a verb class participates, or from which it is prohibited. <p> See [13, 14] for a more detailed discussion of the effect of polysemy in lexical acquisition using data from <ref> [37] </ref>. final-final-lex-choice.tex; 29/05/1996; 0:25; no v.; p.14 Multilingual Generation 15 (17) 18.1 hit verbs: fl2.1 Dative +1.2.6.1 Characteristic Property of Agent +1.2.6.2 Characteristic Property of Instrument +1.3 Conative +2.12 Body-Part Possessor Ascension +2.5.2 Together Reciprocal (trans) +2.8 With/Against +7.5 Resultative +7.6.1 Unintentional Interpretation of Reflexive Object +7.6.2 Unintentional Interpretation of Body-Part <p> 1.2.1 Unspecified Object [atelic] 3.4 Abstract Cause Subject [telic] (iii) 37.5 talk verbs (speak, talk ) 1.2.7 Way Object [atelic] 7.4 X's Way [atelic] 2.5.4 Simple Reciprocal (intrans) [telic] The conflict in each of the three cases may be attributed to certain fine-grained distinctions made within individual verb classes in <ref> [37] </ref>. For example, class 37.1|verbs of transfer of a message|is mixed with respect to participation in the two relevant alternations: Unspecified Object makes atelic predicates telic and applies to write, but not to explain); Abstract Cause Subject applies only to telic predicates, i.e. to explain, but not write). <p> The Understood Reflexive Object Alternation in (25)(i) predicates change in, for example, a body, to the state of clean, dressed, etc. 22 The Clear Alternation in (25)(ii) applies to a subset of "change of state" verbs <ref> [37, p. 124] </ref>. The Total Transformation Alternations in (25)(iii-iv) describe complete transformations, for which the final state is obligatorily expressed [37, p. 178]. <p> The Total Transformation Alternations in (25)(iii-iv) describe complete transformations, for which the final state is obligatorily expressed <ref> [37, p. 178] </ref>.

These LCSs were automatically derived from a manually-encoded set of templates (taken from (28)) for Levin's semantic classes, consisting of 2775 unique verbs distributed across 3828 verbs in Levin (some verbs occur in multiple classes).

Reference-contexts: The work reported here is part of an ongoing effort to build a computational model that characterizes knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface <ref> [18, 37, 38, 39, 65, 66] </ref>, taking into account the requirements of the translation task. We aim to identify the linguistically relevant properties of predicate meaning that may be used in a translation interlingua (language-independent representation) and proposed as candidates for linguistic universals. <p> It is therefore crucial for the tasks of lexical choice and syntactic realization. From the syntactic point of view, this feature has been correlated with both transitivity [65, 66, 69] and unaccusativity <ref> [38, 39] </ref>. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that telicity and related notions (e.g., Verkuyl's `terminative aspect' [73] and Tenny's `measure' and `terminative' roles [66] interact "more profoundly with grammar and syntax" than other lexical aspect features, such as durativity ([+durative]) [67, p. 123]. <p> Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to use these semantic components in a large-scale repository of lexical conceptual structures (LCSs)|in the spirit of a number of researchers <ref> [20, 27, 31, 32, 38, 39] </ref>|which encode meaning components that reflect different values of the telicity feature. This repository, which is hierarchically organized, serves as the basis of a lexical-choice module of a MT system [15, 17, 18, 19]. <p> Moreover, the structural-coverage matching scheme is a prerequisite for recursive instantiation of substructures that are not necessarily aligned with the full structure of the interlingua during the translation process. Finally, Levin's classification system [37] has been refined in later work <ref> [38, 39] </ref>, where regularities in lexical representations|and the rules that operate on these representations|can be exploited for a more economical approach to MT. Such regularities would be lost if we were to adopt a numerical "closest match" scheme. <p> We adopt a refinement of the LCS representation, incorporating meaning components from the linguistically motivated notion of lexical semantic template (LST)|as defined in the work of Levin and Rap-paport Hovav <ref> [38, 39] </ref>. The LST framework provides a decomposition of verbs into structural representations containing constants , where a verb with many meanings reflects multiple pairings between constants and structures. <p> Assignment of LCSs to Telic and Atelic Verbs The distinction between telic and atelic verbs, and their associated semantic representations described above, mirrors the dichotomy in the verb lexicon between "result" and "means/manner"|a basic distinction in the verb lexicon characterized by Levin and Rappaport Hovav <ref> [38, 39] </ref>, and others, and supported by data on language acquisition as described by a number of researchers [5, 6, 23, 25, inter alia]. <p> This simplified diagram does not illustrate the structural positioning of the arguments John and room. However, unlike the boldfaced constituents, these are more rigidly positioned by linking rules (see, e.g., <ref> [32, 39] </ref>) that map syntactic arguments into semantic positions, and vice versa.

Spanish typically includes more contextual background than English and, as such, does not employ verbs that convey manner of motion as often as English does.

Reference-contexts: Languages vary considerably with respect to how telicity is realized in the corresponding surface structures. Languages such as Kore-an and the Romance languages tend to lexicalize paths in verbs (e.g., Spanish entrar `enter'). They may therefore have (or perhaps employ) more [+telic] verbs (cf. <ref> [59] </ref>) and possibly more alternations that indicate telicity. In contrast, English, Mandarin, and non-Romance Indo-European languages tend to lexicalize paths external to verbs, as in go in.

Reference-contexts: associated lexicons, our lexical entries are driven by our lexicalization needs and the primitives in the interlingual syntax. (By contrast, in many large-scale, knowledge-based MT projects, the concepts in the knowledge base drive the definitions of lexical entries.) Alternative lexical choice frameworks have been explored by a number of researchers <ref> [1, 30, 48, 55, 57, 61] </ref>. In the approach of Palmer and Wu [48], lexical mismatches are resolved through the use of a conceptual lattice based on an adapted version of the classification in [37].

The novelty of our approach is that, in the spirit of work by a number of researchers <ref> [24, 38, 50, 63] </ref>, the interlingual representation is designed to preserve the linguisticaly relevant semantic structure of the source- and target-language sentences while still retaining the idiosyncratic semantic content underlying the interlingual primitives. <p> Two other open-class words, ball and Beth, are also represented by constants, hBALLi and hBETHi. The remainder of the representation is the linguistically analyzed semantic structure, as described in [24, p. 1], following a number of researchers including <ref> [50, 63] </ref>. The systematic use of the LST-style constant in our representations allows us to transcend Jackendoff 's framework by providing an entry point into a deeper knowledge representation (KR) level, where information such as spatial orientation and temporal duration are provided.

Furthermore, the typological differences in lexicalization patterns have parallels in a wide range of conceptual fields <ref> [64] </ref>. Telicity therefore plays a critical role in determining how event structure maps onto surface structure. For translation, then, one might envision an algorithm based upon this typology, such that Spanish [+telic] verbs map onto English verbs and an appropriate [+telic] constituent (see [44, p. 352ff]).

Reference-contexts: Some have argued that the temporal properties represented by lexical aspect features fall outside the domain of semantics proper. Porter [51], for example, adopts this position because the lexical aspect features|unlike the grammatical aspect features [+imperfective] and [+perfective]|are not morphologically realized. In contrast, Vendler <ref> [71, p. 102] </ref> demonstrates that lexical aspect is semantically relevant by showing how his four categories (state, activity, accomplishment, and achievement) behave differently in a variety of temporal test frames, such as For how long did X V? and How long did it take X to V? .
