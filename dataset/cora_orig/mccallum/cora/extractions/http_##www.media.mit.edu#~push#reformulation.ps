Reference-contexts: The structures and types of the representations we might use have been deeply studied, especially for the problem of representing our commonsense world; good references are [LEN90] and <ref> [DAV90] </ref>. But less studied is the crucial issue of how to select an appropriate representation for the problem at hand.

Reference-contexts: Douglas Hofstaedter. We were very inspired by Douglas Hofstaedters various projects on treating pattern recognition as an analogy-making and reformulation process. No one has written as eloquently as he on the fundamental importance of reformulation in problem solving, e.g. <ref> [HOF95] </ref> 10 1.5 Overall Organization This thesis is organized into 5 chapters beyond this introduction: Chapter 2 We discuss why we need multiple representations, and describe a particular representation known as a frame. Systems of frames can be put together to build arbitrarily detailed representations of situations.

Reference-contexts: We explore how such a change of viewpoint might take place. 1.4 Related Work Marvin Minsky. This work is based heavily on the ideas about frames, frame systems, and matching in Marvin Minsky's influential essay "A Framework for Representing Knowledge" <ref> [MIN75] </ref>; and additionally, on the ideas about agents, reformulation, differences, level bands, A-brains and B-brains in his seminal The Society of Mind [MIN85]. Newell, Shaw, & Simon. <p> To do this we will use a representational unit called a frame, first described in <ref> [MIN75] </ref>. With frames we can avoid having to use a single large representation, and can instead use many specialized frames, each representing a particular aspect of the situation.

Newell, Shaw, & Simon. Another important influence was Newell, Shaw, and 9 Simon's early description of the General Problem Solver [NEW59], which demonstrated the profound problem solving heuristic of eliminating differences, and to us served as a model for how to do a piece of AI research. <p> Here we must choose between roll-grocery-cart and slide-desk. The method roll-grocery-cart requires wheels, so we try slide-desk, which works. 3.4 Means-End Hierarchies and Level Bands The means-end hierarchy is a simplified version of Minskys level band idea, as described in <ref> [MIN85] </ref>. The level band idea is that a description of something can be divided into many partial descriptions at many levels of abstraction.

Reference-contexts: This principle is rarely stated explicitly, but it explains why the theories that are most popular in AI are all so simple, reflecting, as Minsky wrote in <ref> [MIN90] </ref>, theoretically neat, but conceptually impoverished ideological positions. So in our research we take the opposite approach. Rather than try to find a single mechanism capable of solving all problems, we try to match types of problems to types of solutions.

Reference-contexts: Marvin Minsky has suggested that one of the main purposes of human emotions is to play such a resource management role <ref> [MIN98] </ref>. B. Incorporate anticipation and planning In any exploration of problem solving, the issue of planning is an important consideration. However, the problem solver we described is essentially reactive on differences and default assumptions.

GPS solved problems by (a) recognizing important differences and (b) taking actions to eliminate those differences. Let us refer to any problem solver that works this way as one that employs difference-driven control.

Roger Schank. Our work is in many ways related to that of Roger Schank and his students, especially Kris Hammond and Ashwin Ram. <p> But if we have hundreds of method variations rather than just a few general methods, this could be a very expensive proposition. Newell and Simon later proposed a way of automatically refining the difference-table by applying learning <ref> [NEW60] </ref>, but despite the potential power of the learning approach they described 4 , it was fundamentally hampered by the limitations of the difference 4 They applied a meta-GPS to diagonalize the difference-method table of another GPS!

Reference-contexts: we can go from thinking of the fishtank as a small-fishtank to the fruitful reformulation of thinking of it as a heavy-desk? To help guide reformulation when there are many potential representations, we connect frames into an organization known as a difference network, first described in Patrick Winstons Ph.D. thesis <ref> [WIN70] </ref>. In any substantial frame-based system there will be sufficiently many frames that fast access to them will require that they be organized into some sort of retrieval network. In a difference network, we organize frames so that they are linked by descriptions of the differences between them.
