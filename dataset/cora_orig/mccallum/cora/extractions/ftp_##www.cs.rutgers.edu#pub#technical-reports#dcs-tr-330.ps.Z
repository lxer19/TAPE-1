Abstract: We derive a lower bound on determinants, utilizing a theorem of linear programming. Let l and u be positive lower and upper bounds on the moduli of the eigenvalues of a real or complex invertible matrix A. If the modulus of the trace of A is at least nl, n the dimension of A, we derive a better lower bound on the determinant of A than the trivial lower bound, l n . In particular, given a diagonally dominant real matrix with positive diagonal entries, our lower bound is applicable and improves the lower bound derivable from Gerschgorin's circle theorem. We describe the application of the lower bound as an auxiliary result in representing square roots, the number , and e x , as the limiting quotient of Toeplitz determinants.

Reference-contexts: The feasible set of the optimization problem is a feasible polytope of a bounded variable linear programming, in fact a knapsack polytope. It is well-known that a feasible vertex must have n linearly independent active constraints, see Dantzig <ref> [1] </ref>, Schrijver [6]. It follows that if v is a vertex of the feasible set, then at most one of the components is not equal to l or u. Let x fl = (x fl 1 ; : : : ; x fl optimal solution of the above optimization problem.

Reference-contexts: For instance A 3 = B 4 1 0 0 2 4 C The matrix A n is in particular a Toeplitz matrix, i.e. a matrix that has identical entries along each diagonal (see e.g. Golub and Van Loan <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: applies with l = 1, u = 7, and k (l; u) = d n 2 e, to give jdet (A n )j 7 nd n 2 e = 7 b n Using a main theorem that generalizes Taylor's theorem, together with the above lower bound and Hadamard's inequality, in <ref> [3] </ref>, it is shown that we have p n!1 det (A n+1 ) For sequences converging to square root of arbitrary numbers see [3]. Example 2. <p> 7 nd n 2 e = 7 b n Using a main theorem that generalizes Taylor's theorem, together with the above lower bound and Hadamard's inequality, in <ref> [3] </ref>, it is shown that we have p n!1 det (A n+1 ) For sequences converging to square root of arbitrary numbers see [3]. Example 2. Let T n be the n fi n matrix whose subdiagonal entries are 1=2, the remaining lower triangular part is filled with zeros, and for each row the entries starting with the diagonal entry are filled with the numbers 1; 0; 1=3!; 0; 1=5!; 0; 1=7!, etc. <p> For simplicity assume n is even. Note that ff = 2 1 + 5! Thus, jdet (T n )j (1 ff 2 ) n n considerably better than the trivial lower bound from Gerschgorin's theorem, i.e. 0:3 n . Using the above bound as an auxiliary result, in <ref> [3] </ref> we prove = 3 lim det (T n ) : Example 3. Let f (x) = e x , and P n (x) = 1 + x + x 2 =2! + : : : + x n =n!, its Taylor polynomial at the origin. <p> 4 (x) 1 1 1 0 1 P 4 (x) 1 1 0 0 1 P 4 (x) 1 C C ; F 3 = B 1 1 1 1 P 4 (x) 1 1 0 1 P 4 (x) 1 C Now let det (E n (x)) : In <ref> [3] </ref> it is shown that for x 2 I = [0; 1=8], we have e x = lim n (x): In fact the convergence appears to be valid in a larger interval. <p> For example it appears that n (1) not only converges to e, but surprisingly despite the fact that it uses the same data as available to P n (1), it consistently gives a better approximation (see <ref> [3] </ref>, Table 2). To prove the above convergence requires a good lower bound on det (E n (x)) for x 2 I.

Reference-contexts: Replacing the objective function with ln ( Q n i=1 x i ), we obtain an equivalent optimization which consists of the minimization of a concave function over a polytope. It is well-known (see Rockafellar <ref> [5] </ref>) that the optimal solution is attained at a vertex of the feasible polytope. The feasible set of the optimization problem is a feasible polytope of a bounded variable linear programming, in fact a knapsack polytope.
