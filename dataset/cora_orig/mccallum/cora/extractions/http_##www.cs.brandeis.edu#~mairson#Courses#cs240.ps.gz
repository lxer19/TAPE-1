Abstract: This course is a computer scientist's introduction to topics in logic that are relevant to computation, with applications to problems in theory (circuits and completeness theorems), software engineering (programming languages, data types, program synthesis), and artificial intelligence (formal planning). Unlike typical logic courses, it stresses computational metaphors: algorithmics, constructive mathematics, computational complexity, and decidability. The basic topics of the course are: The discussion of propositional logic includes a study in miniature of resolution-based theorem proving procedures, and of logical characterizations of complexity classes. The survey of first-order logic includes discussion of logic as a database query language, and a proof of the completeness theorem that can be used as a proof search technique (i.e., resolution). Intuitionistic logic introduces -calculus (the theory on which Lisp, Scheme, and other functional languges are based) as a mechanism for representing and manipulating proofs. Our discussion of higher-order logic stresses complexity issues, and how proofs can be analyzed to produce computational information, proving a version of the famous "Dialectica" theorem of Godel. The course concludes with a discussion of linear logic, a so-called resource-conscious logic; we will discuss the relationship between cut-elimination (proof simplification) in linear logic, and evaluation of programs written in -calculus.
