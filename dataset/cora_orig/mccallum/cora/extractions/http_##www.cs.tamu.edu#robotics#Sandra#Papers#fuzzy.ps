Abstract: This paper defines a problem that we called "fuzzy satisfiability" or "ffi-satisfiability." It describes in mathematical terms the semantics of satisfying clauses and formulas using fuzzy logic, by converting a boolean formula into an arithmetic expression via t-norm and t-conorm operators. It is shown that for any (t-norm, t-conorm) pair, the corresponding ffi-satisfiability problem is NP-hard when the values of the variables are restricted to f0; 1g. More interesting, even when the values of the variables are in the closed interval [0; 1], a large class of t-conorms exists for which the ffi-satisfiability problem remains NP-hard. A simple sufficient condition is provided for t-conorms to be in this class. It is shown that the optimization versions of the problems discussed here can be formulated as special cases of nonlinear programming.

Reference-contexts: Since the classical satisfiability problem is NP hard, the ffi-satisfiability problem is also NP-hard. 2 V. ffi-SATISFIABILITY WITH T : X 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> By definition, when the arithmetization of a clause based on hard-t-conorms is 1-satisfiable, then at least one literal must have a truth assignment of 1. <p> In either case, there exists at least one literal l 0 with T (l 0 2 The next lemma shows that when the arithmetization of a formula is 1-satisfiable, then the arithmetization of every clause in that formula is 1-satisfiable. Lemma 7: If there exists T: X 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then for every C i in F , (C i ) j T (X) = 1. Proof: If 9 T: X 7! [0; 1] s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then, m i=1 ((C i )) j <p> Lemma 7: If there exists T: X 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then for every C i in F , (C i ) j T (X) = 1. Proof: If 9 T: X 7! [0; 1] s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then, m i=1 ((C i )) j T (X) = 1. By (3), 1 i=1 ((C i )) j T (X) . Therefore, for every C i in F, (C i ) j T (X) = 1. <p> Therefore, for every C i in F, (C i ) j T (X) = 1. The following lemma shows that when hard-t-conorms are used to arithmetize a formula and the arithmetization is 1-satisfiable, then the boolean formula is satisfiable. Lemma 8: If there exists T: X 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then 9 T 0 F j T 0 (X) = 1. Proof: Suppose that 9 T : X 7! [0; 1] s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1. <p> Lemma 8: If there exists T: X 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1, then 9 T 0 F j T 0 (X) = 1. Proof: Suppose that 9 T : X 7! [0; 1] s.t. (; )(F ) j T (X) = 1. By lemma 7, for every C i in F , (C i ) j T (X) = 1. Using lemma 6, for every 0 F, there exists an l 0 with T (l 0 ) = 1. <p> We have shown that for some t-conorms, the ffi-satisfiability problem is NP-hard, while for others, the problem can be trivially solved. This result provides several ways to transform the satisfiability problem, which deals with boolean variables, to arithmetic expressions using variables which can take values in the continuous interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We indicated how the corresponding optimization versions of the ffi-satisfiability problem can be expressed as nonlinear programming problems.
