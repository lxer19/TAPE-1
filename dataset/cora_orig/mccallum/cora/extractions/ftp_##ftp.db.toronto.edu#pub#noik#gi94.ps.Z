Abstract: The graph topo-visual formalism has been shown to be well-suited to the task of visualizing complex relations on a set of elements. Unfortunately, most visual formalisms do not scale very well. This observation is particularly true of graphs, which even when hand-drawn by an artist, are seldom meaningful when the number of nodes or links exceeds a very modest threshold typically only a few hundred elements. This severe limitation has prompted many researchers to seek alternative visualization techniques that may eliminate, or, at the very least, raise this threshold. In this paper we analyze these recent efforts, describe an abstract space of presentation emphasis techniques, and locate the current approaches within this space. The contributions of this paper are several: (1) a significant portion of recent work is collected and reviewed; (2) a common set of criteria and a taxonomy of graph views are proposed; these, (3) permit a more direct comparison of previous work; which helps to, (4) identify common shortcomings and limitations; which in turn, (5) suggest future directions.

Reference-contexts: Only 7 out of 22 techniques provide some type of animation. Animation, when effectively used, can transform a cognitive task into a perceptual one [22]. In fact, studies of interaction with 3-D graph layouts have shown that motion can provide more valuable perceptual clues than stereopsis <ref> [1, 33] </ref>. Animation is also useful in 2-D; graphical fisheye views [23, 24], for example, use smooth animation to create a dynamic FEV: the distortion is continually recomputed and updated as the user changes the location of the FP by dragging a mouse.

Reference-contexts: An implicit FEV arises from the effect of point perspective in 3-D, by which nearby points loom large and distant points appear small; implicit FEVs are usually static (e.g., <ref> [5, 14, 22] </ref>), but may be dynamic if the 3-D layout is permitted to be altered (e.g., by moving higher priority nodes to the foreground [21]). There are at least three types of emphasized views (EVs). <p> An adorned view emphasizes elements by varying other visual presentation variables such as colour, shading, line style and thickness, as well as audio [13], and motion (e.g., in-betweening animation [21], vertical oscillations and small random movements <ref> [5] </ref>, vibration or pulsing [27]). <p> An nth order FEV is obtained by only displaying points with DOI (v) (3 + 2 fl n). SemNet. Three EAs for the 3-D networks of SemNet were proposed: clustering (filtering FEV), 3-D point perspective (static implicit FEV), and sampling density (filtering FEV) <ref> [5] </ref>. In clustering, recursive subdivision of the 3-D graph volume yielded an 8-ary tree with SemNet nodes partitioned among its leaves; tree distance (an approximation of Euclidean distance) was used in the DOI function. <p> Cone Trees. Cone trees display hierarchical information by using 3-D graphics and interactive animation [22]. By limiting the domain of inputs to hierarchies, Cone Tree visualizations were not exposed to many of the problems that complicated the design of SemNet <ref> [5] </ref> and increased the cognitive load placed on its users. Cone tree visualizations support two types of FEVs: distortion from 3-D point perspective (static implicit FEV), and filtering through interactive gardening operations (filtered view). <p> # of Ani- Inputs mation Technique FPs ma gv/vv i/f /d/a s/A/D/a/d 0/1/fl tion? s/h/g/n/fl Non-graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs [7] 04/86 Aircraft maintenance [18] 08/90 Perspective Wall [15] 04/91 Tree-Maps [12, 13, 28, 32] 10/91 Stretch Tools [25] 09/92 Morphing [26] 11/93 Graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs of trees [7] 04/86 SemNet (implicit) <ref> [5] </ref> 1988 SemNet (clustering) [5] 1988 Topographic networks [10, 11] 1989 Cone trees (implicit/search) [22] 04/91 Cone trees (gardening) [22] 04/91 MVP display methods [17, 29] 09/91 Associative networks [6] 10/91 Interactive graph layout [9] 1991 Graphical FEVs [23, 24] 05/92 Abridgment [16] 05/93 Variable Zoom [27] 05/93 Fractal views of <p> mation Technique FPs ma gv/vv i/f /d/a s/A/D/a/d 0/1/fl tion? s/h/g/n/fl Non-graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs [7] 04/86 Aircraft maintenance [18] 08/90 Perspective Wall [15] 04/91 Tree-Maps [12, 13, 28, 32] 10/91 Stretch Tools [25] 09/92 Morphing [26] 11/93 Graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs of trees [7] 04/86 SemNet (implicit) <ref> [5] </ref> 1988 SemNet (clustering) [5] 1988 Topographic networks [10, 11] 1989 Cone trees (implicit/search) [22] 04/91 Cone trees (gardening) [22] 04/91 MVP display methods [17, 29] 09/91 Associative networks [6] 10/91 Interactive graph layout [9] 1991 Graphical FEVs [23, 24] 05/92 Abridgment [16] 05/93 Variable Zoom [27] 05/93 Fractal views of trees [14] 08/93 PLUM

Reference-contexts: Graph layouts may be hand-drawn or may be generated automatically by a graph layout al-gorithm [4]. In addition to textual labels, nodes may also have additional content (e.g., graphical icons). 2.2 Emphasis-related Concepts The following terminology comes in large part from the generalized fisheye view (FEV) formalism <ref> [7] </ref>. The generalized FEV metaphor is based on the workings of the fisheye or very wide angle lens used in photography, which magnifies the image at multiple levels greatest near the lens' focus and least in its periphery. <p> This formalism for reducing the complexity of highly detailed visualizations by displaying subsets of the most relevant details <ref> [7] </ref>, generates filtering FEVs. As mentioned earlier, in a generalized FEV, DOI (p) = API (p) - Dist (p; f ), given FP f . Aircraft Maintenance Diagrams. This EA, an extension of the generalized FEV strategy for presenting aircraft maintenance data [18], generates filtering FEVs. <p> The generalized FEV formalism was extended to capture multiple FPs in a directed network by rewriting Dist as the sum of shortest path distances from a vertex to the FPs. The resulting prioritization of vertices enabled the construction of nth order FEVs, similar to the generalized FEVs of trees <ref> [7] </ref>. The Perspective Wall. This EA for visualizing linear information [15] such as time, generates globally scaled views. It uses graphics hardware support to fold wide 2-D charts into 3-D visualizations consisting of a center panel for showing detail and two perspective panels for displaying context. <p> This EA for simplifying the display of trees by suppressing less relevant nodes <ref> [7] </ref>, generates filtering FEVs. A generalized FEV of a tree is obtained by providing specific instantiations of the API and Dist functions. <p> The fractal filtering mechanism has one nice property that the generalized FEV of trees <ref> [7] </ref> does not: it guarantees that as the FP changes, the number of nodes whose fractal value exceeds a specified threshold will remain nearly constant regardless of branching factor. <p> Approach Date Transfor- Emphasis Priorities # of Ani- Inputs mation Technique FPs ma gv/vv i/f /d/a s/A/D/a/d 0/1/fl tion? s/h/g/n/fl Non-graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs <ref> [7] </ref> 04/86 Aircraft maintenance [18] 08/90 Perspective Wall [15] 04/91 Tree-Maps [12, 13, 28, 32] 10/91 Stretch Tools [25] 09/92 Morphing [26] 11/93 Graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs of trees [7] 04/86 SemNet (implicit) [5] 1988 SemNet (clustering) [5] 1988 Topographic networks [10, 11] 1989 Cone trees (implicit/search) [22] 04/91 Cone trees (gardening) <p> Date Transfor- Emphasis Priorities # of Ani- Inputs mation Technique FPs ma gv/vv i/f /d/a s/A/D/a/d 0/1/fl tion? s/h/g/n/fl Non-graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs <ref> [7] </ref> 04/86 Aircraft maintenance [18] 08/90 Perspective Wall [15] 04/91 Tree-Maps [12, 13, 28, 32] 10/91 Stretch Tools [25] 09/92 Morphing [26] 11/93 Graph-oriented: Generalized FEVs of trees [7] 04/86 SemNet (implicit) [5] 1988 SemNet (clustering) [5] 1988 Topographic networks [10, 11] 1989 Cone trees (implicit/search) [22] 04/91 Cone trees (gardening) [22] 04/91 MVP display methods [17, 29] 09/91 Associative networks [6] 10/91 Interactive graph layout [9] 1991 Graphical FEVs [23, 24] 05/92 Abridgment [16] 05/93 Variable Zoom [27]

Reference-contexts: Ironically, the highly interactive nature of the technique makes it less appropriate for exploring very large hierarchies amore automatic solution would be preferred (i.e., it is unrealistic to expect users to work hard to simplify visualizations of large hierarchies). Compound Digraph Display Methods. Three multi-viewpoint perspective (MVP) EAs <ref> [17, 29] </ref> have been applied to drawings of compound digraphs [30]: the fisheye EA uses a polar transformation to map each point in the original drawing to the perimeter of a circle (polar distorting FEV); the orthogonal fisheye EA uses independent Cartesian transformations to map each point to the perimeter of <p> Animation can be used to reduce abrupt changes caused by a change in the set of FPs.

Reference-contexts: Compound Digraph Display Methods. Three multi-viewpoint perspective (MVP) EAs [17, 29] have been applied to drawings of compound digraphs <ref> [30] </ref>: the fisheye EA uses a polar transformation to map each point in the original drawing to the perimeter of a circle (polar distorting FEV); the orthogonal fisheye EA uses independent Cartesian transformations to map each point to the perimeter of a square (orthogonal distorting FEV) meaning that lines that were <p> Although graphical FEVs can be implemented effi-ciently using dedicated graphics hardware, the technique is limited to non-nested graphs with a single FP. Abridgment. This EA, used in the D-ABDUCTOR system [16] for viewing and manipulating compound digraphs <ref> [30] </ref>, generates hybrid filtering fisheye and non-geometric distorting fisheye views. Priorities are computed as a linear combination of three quantities: structural importance (vertex nesting depth); semantic importance (API); and focal importance (proximity to the set of FPs).

Reference-contexts: Only 7 out of 22 techniques provide some type of animation. Animation, when effectively used, can transform a cognitive task into a perceptual one [22]. In fact, studies of interaction with 3-D graph layouts have shown that motion can provide more valuable perceptual clues than stereopsis <ref> [1, 33] </ref>. Animation is also useful in 2-D; graphical fisheye views [23, 24], for example, use smooth animation to create a dynamic FEV: the distortion is continually recomputed and updated as the user changes the location of the FP by dragging a mouse.
