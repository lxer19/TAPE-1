Abstract: and 172 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. No evidence for these particles has been found. The results are combined with those from previous OPAL chargino and neutralino searches at lower energies to obtain limits. Exclusion regions at 95% C.L. of parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model are determined. Within this framework, for tan fi 1:0, lower mass limits are placed on the lightest chargino and the three lightest neutralinos. The 95% C.L. lower mass limit on the lightest chargino, assuming that it is heavier than the lightest neutralino by more than 10 GeV, is 84.5 GeV for the case of a large universal scalar mass (m 0 &gt; 1 TeV) and 65.7 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with current limits on the sneutrino and slepton masses. The lower limit on the lightest neutralino mass at 95% C.L. for tan fi 1:0 is 24.7 GeV for m 0 = 1 TeV and 13.3 GeV for the minimum m 0 scenario. These mass limits are higher for increasing values of tan fi. The interpretation of the limits in terms of gluino and scalar quark mass limits is also given.

Reference-contexts: This "naturalness" or "gauge hierarchy" problem must be addressed by any new theory that attempts to unify the fundamental forces. One of the most promising candidates for this new physics is the theory of supersymmetry (SUSY) <ref> [1] </ref> that extends the Standard Model with a new type of symmetry between fermions and bosons that also allows for the incorporation of the gravitational force. <p> In October and November 1996 the LEP e + e collider at CERN was run at the new centre-of-mass energies ( p s) of 170 and 172 GeV, thus expanding the kinematically accessible region for new particle searches. A direct search for charginos and neutralinos predicted in SUSY theories <ref> [1] </ref> is described using the data collected with the OPAL detector. The large predicted cross section for chargino production leads to excellent discovery potential for this SUSY particle with the present integrated luminosity collected at LEP2.

Reference-contexts: More stringent exclusion mass and cross-section limits are obtained compared to the previous results from the analysis of data near the Z peak (LEP1), at p p by the OPAL <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and the other LEP collaborations [4]. The search for charginos is similar to that described in [3] while a new and more efficient method has been incorporated for the neutralino search. <p> The luminosity is measured using small angle Bhabha scattering events detected in the silicon tungsten calorimeter. To select good charged tracks and clusters in the calorimeters, quality requirements identical to those in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> are applied. Calculations of experimental variables are performed using the four-momenta of tracks and of EM or HCAL clusters not associated with charged tracks 6 .

The search for charginos is similar to that described in <ref> [3] </ref> while a new and more efficient method has been incorporated for the neutralino search. Similar, but more model-dependent, limits have been obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron pp collider [5]. <p> For the preselected events 1448 are classified as (A), 1296 as (B) and 3566 as (C). These analyses are similar to those used for the analysis of 161 GeV data <ref> [3] </ref> but their robustness to the larger W + W background has been significantly improved. Isolated leptons are identified in the following way. Electrons are selected if they satisfied either the artificial neural network electron identification described in [30] or the one used for the OPAL R b analysis [31]. <p> The acoplanarity angle should exceed 15 ffi . Furthermore, the total observed mass of the event should be smaller than 100 GeV. (A4) Remaining W + W events where one W decays semileptonically are rejected by using a different lepton algorithm which has less stringent isolation criteria <ref> [3] </ref>. Events containing a lepton of this type, with a hadronic system recoiling against it with a reconstructed mass between 55 to 85 GeV are rejected. Events are then classified according to the number of hadronic jets. <p> To compute the 95% C.L. upper limits, the previous results obtained at p s = 161 GeV <ref> [3] </ref> (including the observed candidates as well as background expectations where kinematically allowed) have been combined with the present results. <p> Figure 13 shows the resulting exclusion regions (shaded regions) in the (M 2 ,) plane for tan fi = 1:5 and 35. The region of M 2 excluded is enlarged significantly with respect to the results at p s = 161 GeV alone <ref> [3] </ref>. In the CMSSM the gauginos have a common mass, m 1=2 , at the GUT scale, therefore the gluino mass (M 3 m ~g ) is directly related to M 2 by M 3 =M 2 = ff s = ff sin 2 W . <p> The exclusion limits on ~ 1 and ~ 0 j production are significantly higher with respect to the results obtained by OPAL at p 161 GeV <ref> [3] </ref>. The 95% C.L. lower mass limit of the chargino is close to the kinematic limit within the framework of the MSSM.

Reference-contexts: Fermionic partners of the fl, the Z boson, and the neutral Higgs bosons mix to form mass eigenstates called neutralinos, ~ 0 i . In each case, the index j or i is ordered by increasing mass. R-parity <ref> [6] </ref> conservation is assumed; therefore, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The LSP is usually considered to be the lightest neutralino, ~ 0 1 , although it could be the scalar neutrino, ~-, if it is sufficiently light. It escapes detection due to its weakly interacting nature.

Reference-contexts: It escapes detection due to its weakly interacting nature. The present analysis is valid in either case. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) <ref> [7] </ref> is used to guide the analysis but more general cases are also studied. In the MSSM two chargino mass eigenstates ( ~ 1 and ~ and four neutralino mass eigenstates ( ~ 0 1 , ~ 0 3 and ~ 0 4 ) are expected to exist.

Reference-contexts: In some regions of SUSY parameter space the radiative decay process ~ 0 1 fl is also possible <ref> [10] </ref>. The MSSM predicted cross-sections for ~ 0 2 ~ 0 1 events can vary significantly depending on the choice of MSSM parameters.

Reference-contexts: These two values of tan fi are theoretically interesting since at these values the model is consistent with both the measured value of the top mass and the mass ratio of the t and the bottom quark. However, tan fi could be as small as 1.0 <ref> [15] </ref>. The phenomenology of chargino and neutralino production and decay changes drastically when tan fi approaches 1.0. Therefore the case of tan fi = 1:0 is also studied.

Reference-contexts: If the sneutrino is lighter than the chargino, the two-body decay ~ ! ~-` ` would dominate, but the subsequent decay of ~-` ! -` ~ 0 j leads to the same final state topology as the leptonic decay via ~ 0 j W (fl) The SUSYGEN Monte Carlo generator <ref> [17] </ref> is used to calculate these branching fractions. In this publication, the OPAL detector is described in Section 2.

Both generators include initial state radiation. The JETSET 7.4 package [20] is used for the hadronisation of the quark-antiquark system in the chargino or neutralino hadronic decays.

Reference-contexts: In evaluating the number of background events, the cross-sections were calculated at the actual centre-of mass energies (170.3 GeV and 172.3 GeV) and were weighted by the corresponding collected luminosities. Generated signal and background events were processed through the full simulation of the OPAL detector <ref> [28] </ref> and the same event analysis chain was applied to the simulated events as to the data. 4 Analysis The analysis is performed on data collected during the 1996 autumn run of LEP at centre-of-mass energies of p s =170.3 and 172.3 GeV.

Reference-contexts: tracks, the cluster energy is not used. 6 The masses of all charged particles are set to the charged pion mass, and the invariant masses of the calorimeter energy clusters are assumed to be zero. 8 Jets are formed from charged tracks and calorimeter clusters using the Durham algo- rithm <ref> [29] </ref> with a jet resolution parameter of y cut = 0:005, unless otherwise specified. To select well measured events the following preselection criteria are applied: (P1) The number of charged tracks satisfying the quality criteria is required to be at least two. <p> This analysis will also be used in the neutralino search as described later. Events are forced into two jets using the Durham jet algorithm <ref> [29] </ref> and are required to satisfy the following cuts on the jet and event variables: (C1) One of the jets must have a transverse momentum greater than 1.5 GeV and the other must have a transverse momentum greater than 1.0 GeV. (C2) A cut is applied to P t (shown in

Reference-contexts: The problem associated with tan fi approaching 1.0 is clear from Fig. 14 where the region near M 2 = = 0 is not excluded by results from analyses (A)-(D), or from the Z 0 width and direct neutralino searches at LEP1 <ref> [39] </ref>. For the case of tan fi = 1:0, the results from analyses (E) and (F) are therefore invoked, and the consequent excluded regions are shown as the hatched regions overlaid onto the regions excluded by analyses (A)-(D) in Fig. 14 (a) and (b). <p> The region extending beyond the kinematic limit for chargino pair production in Fig. 15 (a) is due to the direct topological search for neutralinos at LEP1 <ref> [39] </ref> illustrated in Fig. 14. The analogous exclusion regions in the (m ~ 0 1 ,m ~ 0 2 ) plane are shown in Fig. 16. A smaller fraction of the accessible region of mass space for neutralino production is excluded because of the smaller predicted cross-sections for neutralinos.
