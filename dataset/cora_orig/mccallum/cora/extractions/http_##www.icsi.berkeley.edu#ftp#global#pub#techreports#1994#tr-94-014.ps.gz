Abstract: Active and selective perception seeks regions of interest in an image in order to reduce the computational complexity associated with time-consuming processes such as object recognition. We describe in this paper a visual attention system that extracts regions of interest by integrating multiple image cues. Bottom-up cues are detected by decomposing the image into a number of feature and conspicuity maps, while a-priori knowledge (i.e. models) about objects is used to generate top-down attention cues. Bottom-up and top-down information is combined through a non-linear relaxation process using energy minimization-like procedures. The functionality of the attention system is expanded by the introduction of an alerting (motion-based) system able to explore and avoid obstacles. Experimental results are reported, using cluttered and noisy scenes.
