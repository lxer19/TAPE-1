Reference-contexts: Therefore in order to complete the next sub-task the other agents in the system go through their cycles and through iteration 5 the mission path after completion of a driver program (path followed from left to right). of a simple inverse differential kinematics procedure <ref> [1] </ref> cause the constraints specified at the next sub-task to be satisfied. The angle information at this sub-task is stored in a temporary buffer.

Reference-contexts: The way of going about operating in an open world is by nature a completely different story to that of production-line operation, and this affects the robot controller at a fundamental level. Our opinion <ref> [2, 9] </ref> as well as that of various other researchers [5, 11], is that the open world is to be felt and dealt with right down at the level of the controller architecture and its individual motor control loops.

Reference-contexts: In the next section we investigate the benefits and costs of driver programs more thoroughly with specific tasks. 4 Simulation studies In order to test the driver program motion learning method we used a simulated arm <ref> [3] </ref> (Figure 4a). The arm has 5 degrees of freedom that are relevant for TCP positioning (another 2 are solely for gripper state and orientation). Although the simulation environment is clearly not an open world it suffices to test certain aspects of the method.

Reference-contexts: [6] (the robot moves around and stores information about the layout of a building), wall following (a wall may be identified after sufficient experience is gathered and it is then attempted to move parallel to it), and coordination of many legs to walk over a rugged terrain (Brooks' six-legged robot <ref> [4] </ref> is a prime example of this type of behavior). The latter is the nearest to the kind of learned motions one would hope to see in a manipulator: one starts with a number of simple individual motions and attempts to coordinate them to achieve a physical objective.

Reference-contexts: How might a reactive system gather experience and use it to influence its future behavior? The standard examples are in map building <ref> [6] </ref> (the robot moves around and stores information about the layout of a building), wall following (a wall may be identified after sufficient experience is gathered and it is then attempted to move parallel to it), and coordination of many legs to walk over a rugged terrain (Brooks' six-legged robot [4]

Reference-contexts: This results in them being chosen less often, and consequently more of them being generated. Thus one typically obtains an optimum, representing the best tradeoff between bias and variance <ref> [7] </ref>. This should be automatically setable in an open world. A way of doing this is to enable stripping and concatenation of driver programs. It is not possible to give a detailed description of these processes here.

Reference-contexts: Such methods make sense for the repetitive nature of production-line robot tasks: the cost is in the initial programming and for the foreseeable future thereafter the robots may perform perfectly for the given task. However a further rapidly growing application area of robotics is the so-called "service robot" field <ref> [8] </ref>. Here the emphasis is less on the high precision and fast motion of a robot, as on the automation and successful completion of mundane tasks themselves.

Reference-contexts: It is the job of the predictor (Figure 1a) to estimate the scale of this divergence. In this article space limitations prevent us from an exact definition of the predictor process (see <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> The relevance calculated by the comparator is in the form of an estimate of the divergence ffi c between the effect of the execution of the driver program in question and the desired task. Again, space limitations prevent us from a detailed description of ffi c (see <ref> [10] </ref>). The evaluator combines the results from the comparator and predictor and decides on an overall prediction of execution accuracy with which the candidate DP can be used to continue the task.
