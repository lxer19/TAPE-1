Abstract: This paper reports on our investigations into the performance limits of CMOS datapaths. We have used a combination of single phase clocking, reduced voltage swing logic, moderate pipelining, and custom layout to achieve dramatic speed improvements over conventional design techniques. We have also used a novel fast adder structure and register file. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these techniques and circuits, we have designed a test chip including a 64-bit integer datapath and a PLA-based finite state machine for testing. The chip layout was generated using MOSIS design rules and fabricated in the HP CMOS34 1.2-m process. It has been tested and is fully functional at 180MHz.

Reference-contexts: The technique was first introduced as "true single phase clocking" (TSPC) clocking <ref> [6, 1] </ref>. It was demonstrated for very high-speed bit-serial processing and other simple circuits. A single clock is distributed throughout the system, and never inverted. Very simple latches result in fast circuit operation, less latch setup and delay times, and less clock load.

Reference-contexts: In the last block of the adder, the real carry is reconstituted and the final sum calculated. The 2 to 1 reduction in the carry chain was invented by A. Despain and extended by P. de Dood <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These techniques are popular for their robustness to noise and process variations. We have found that abandoning these traditional techniques in favor of a more aggressive design style can lead to significant performance improvements. Similar performance improvements have recently been reported independently by the DEC Alpha team <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. Their processor is a 64-bit RISC-style microprocessor that operates up to 200MHz with a 3.3 volt power supply. It was fabricated in 0.75-m n-well CMOS with three layers of metalization.

Reference-contexts: The latency through the adder is one and a half cycles. The low-level circuits for the adder are fairly straightforward and consists of a Kogge-Stone binary lookahead tree <ref> [5] </ref>. However, a unique 2 to 1 reduction of the carry chain results in a significant reduction in area without affecting the speed. three blocks of alternating n, p, and n stages.
