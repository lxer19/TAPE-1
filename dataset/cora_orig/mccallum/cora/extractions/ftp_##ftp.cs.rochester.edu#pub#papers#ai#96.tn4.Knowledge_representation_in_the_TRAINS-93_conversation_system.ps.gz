Abstract: We describe the goals, architecture, and functioning of the trains-93 system, with emphasis on the representational issues involved in putting together a complex language processing and reasoning agent. The system is intended as an experimental prototype of an intelligent, conversationally proficient planning advisor in a dynamic domain of cargo trains and factories. For this team effort, our strategy at the outset was to let the designers of the various language processing, discourse processing, plan reasoning, execution and monitoring modules choose whatever representations seemed best suited for their tasks, but with the constraint that all should strive for principled, general approaches. Disparities between modules were bridged by careful design of the interfaces, based on regular in-depth discussion of issues encountered by the participants. Because of the goal of generality and principled representation, the multiple representations ended up with a good deal in common (for instance, the use of explicit event variables and the ability to refer to complex abstract objects such as plans); and future unifications seem quite possible. We explain some of the goals and particulars of the KRs used, evaluate the extent to which they served their purposes, and point out some of the tensions between representations that needed to be resolved. On the whole, we found that using very expressive representations minimized the tensions, since it is easier to extract what one needs from an elaborate representation retaining all semantic nuances, than to make up for lost information.

Reference-contexts: It is a typed logic based on interval temporal logic <ref> [Allen, 1984] </ref>, which was designed to facilitate reasoning about actions and events in temporally complex worlds. ebtl is a more restricted language than el or crt: only events and some simple states can be represented directly rather than general episodes and situations.

Reference-contexts: No plan is foolproof, and it is important that a formalism make the necessary assumptions explicit so that they can be considered in evaluating plans. These and similar considerations led us to a representation based on interval temporal logic, the technical details of which are presented in <ref> [Allen and Ferguson, 1994] </ref> 3.5 Planning Knowledge In addition to traditional requirements for a problem solving system, such as the ability to represent the problem, the solution, and operators which lead from one to another, the embedding of a plan reasoner within a mixed-initiative dialogue system adds additional requirements and representational

Reference-contexts: Each year's effort, except for the most recent (trains-95), was centered around one or two particular problem solving dialogues, obtained by slightly editing transcripts selected from a corpus of human-human spoken dialogues involving trains-world problems. An overview of the trains project up to 1994 appears in <ref> [Allen et al., 1995b] </ref>. In the present paper we focus on the interactions between the language understanding components and reasoning components in trains-93, which allows the trains modules to work together in an incremental, cooperative planning process. <p> More details on the system itself, and rationales for choosing the domain can be found in <ref> [Allen et al., 1995b] </ref>. 2.1 The TRAINS Domain The trains-93 system helps a user construct and monitor plans about a railroad freight system.

Reference-contexts: The formalism used in crt extends the language of el with underspecified expressions|expressions that indicate which aspects of a sentence's meaning have to be disambiguated and are given a proper semantics <ref> [Poesio, 1991; Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Reyle, 1993; Poesio, 1995] </ref>. The theory also includes an account of disambiguation as defeasible reasoning over underspecified interpretations of the discourse situation.

Reference-contexts: The deindexed el representation of sentences describing events, processes or situations contains explicit episodic variables. Like situations in situation semantics <ref> [Barwise and Perry, 1983] </ref>, episodes are partial states of affairs in the world, encompassing some properties of some participants over some period of time at some location. Episodes subsume Davidsonian events [Davidson, 1967] as used in many representations, i.e., an event is a particular kind of episode.

If one avoids the choice, subsequent events may rule out some actions, making the choice clearer. Because more evidence also narrows the interval, collecting more evidence may also make 28 possible a choice.

Reference-contexts: to achieve the final goal of an executable shared plan, (e.g., proposing an addition to the plan, or accepting or rejecting a prior suggestion). intentions: The intentions of the system help guide the future behavior of the system, generally constraining future planning to fit within the context of prior intention. <ref> [Bratman, 1987] </ref> describes in detail some of the ways that intentions will help guide and constrain an agents future deliberation. obligations: Obligations are actions that an agent should perform, according to external norms. <p> However, the most useful perspective on the plan varies from module to module, resulting in different ontologies of plans in the different representation languages. This distinction goes far beyond the by now familiar distinction between plans as recipes and plans as mental state <ref> [Bratman, 1987] </ref>. The different views of plans and their rationales are summarized below. Parser/Semantic Interpreter: From a natural language perspective, the semantic category of plans should be whatever category is assigned to them by locutions that directly and uncontroversially specify them.

Reference-contexts: The disambiguation rules are formulated as inference rules which result in a less un-derspecified interpretation. The reasoning framework in which inference is formulated resembles Prioritized Default Logic <ref> [Brewka, 1991] </ref> in that the rules of disambiguation are Reiter-like default inference rules with different priorities, and in that the result of disam 4 For instance, _ : is not a theorem. 22 biguation are zero, one or more extensions of the default theory consisting of the context augmented with the

Reference-contexts: But it can be further argued that nominalized infinitives, nom-inalized for-clauses and gerunds denote kinds/types of actions (or kinds/types of situations/events), and that that-clauses denote propositions (e.g., see <ref> [Chierchia, 1985; Hwang, 1992] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We mention below a couple of issues in which the most natural view of some important phenomenon is different for modules concentrating on different aspects of the planning dialogue task. Common Ground Most work on reference resolution makes the assumption that felicitous reference requires mutual knowledge <ref> [Clark and Marshall, 1981] </ref>, and that, further, everything that is uttered in a shared situation immediately becomes a part of the common ground and, hence, is available for reference.

Reference-contexts: Like situations in situation semantics [Barwise and Perry, 1983], episodes are partial states of affairs in the world, encompassing some properties of some participants over some period of time at some location. Episodes subsume Davidsonian events <ref> [Davidson, 1967] </ref> as used in many representations, i.e., an event is a particular kind of episode. The content of episodes can be described using two special operators, * and **. The ** operator indicates that an arbitrary formula characterizes an episode.

Reference-contexts: and large, these representations capture only a subset of the expressive power of standard FOL, and in terms of their inference capabilities are aimed primarily at subsumption checking [Brachman and Levesque, 1984; Nebel and Smolka, 1991; Schmolze and Israel, 1983; Hayes, 1979]. 8 8 In lexically oriented work such as <ref> [Dorr, 1993] </ref>, Jackendoff's Lexical Conceptual Structures are gaining 44 Our KR formalisms, especially the el and crt representations for language, were seen to be considerably more expressive than FOL. One might ask whether in retrospect the purposes of our project might have been equally well served by a weaker representation.

Reference-contexts: Since these assumptions often drive the dialogue, we have investigated an explicit representation of plans as arguments based on assumptions <ref> [Ferguson, 1995] </ref>. The trains plan reasoner supports interleaved planning and recognition (as necessary in processing dialogue), and exports a variety of functions to other modules of the system, in particular the dialogue manager. <p> Then there are evaluation predicates. These include absolute predicates such as Plausible or Impossible and relative predicates that allow plans to be compared, for example, according to resource usage or time constraints. Further details are available in <ref> [Ferguson, 1995] </ref>. 4.4 Tyro In order to do the reasoning necessary for executing and monitoring plans and statistical reasoning about the effects of actions, we have developed a language, called Tyro. Like ebtl, Tyro is implemented as an extension of rhet. <p> More details on how the rest of the dialogue is represented can be found in [Poesio, 1994], for crt, [Traum, 1994], for ebtl, and <ref> [Ferguson, 1995] </ref>, for the plan graphs.

Reference-contexts: Parsing and Logical Form Computation The first module in the interpretation process is a parser which takes an utterance as input and produces a syntactic analysis together with an underspecified logical form (ULF), allowing for scopal and referential ambiguities. We use a GPSG style grammar <ref> [Gazdar et al., 1985] </ref> that makes extensive use of a feature system including subcategorization features and several feature principles governing feature percolation. Each rule in the grammar consists of a syntactic rule coupled with a corresponding semantic rule. <p> admits the formation of a locative prepositional phrase from a locative preposition and an accusative noun phrase, like at Corning from at and Corning. (The rule name concisely echoes the rule.) The loc feature is transmitted from the preposition to the prepositional phrase through the head feature principle of GPSG <ref> [Gazdar et al., 1985] </ref>. Unlike GPSG, our grammar uses hierarchies of atomic features. For instance, loc belongs to the set of features floc, time, 15 phow, pwhy, subj-matr, opposg which subdivide the ppred (prepositional predicate) feature, and loc is in turn subdivided into fplace, pathg.

Reference-contexts: The results of speech act interpretation are not presented in (2); these would be expressed as the introduction of a new speech act ce2 generated by ce1 (in the sense of Goldman <ref> [Goldman, 1970] </ref>, i.e., occurrence of ce1 by its nature involves the occurrence of speech act ce2). 5 At the moment, the possibility of such a translation is merely a conjecture based on our experience in building the interface to EBTL no formal result has been proved. 23 The `Scope And Deindexing'

Reference-contexts: Thus, the model of context adopted in crt, while inspired in many ways from those used in `dynamic' theories of context such as Discourse Representation Theory (drt) [Kamp, 1981; Kamp and Reyle, 1993] and Dynamic Predicate Logic <ref> [Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991] </ref>, is a model of the effect that utterances have on the discourse situation, rather than of the effect that sentences have on the propositional content of a text. For an example of disambiguation, consider the sentence I can't find the engine.

Reference-contexts: This context consists not just of the content expressed in the utterances, but of structured information about the interaction, as well. The relevant structure which must be maintained to understand and participate felicitously in conversation includes the following: discourse segments: Attentional focusing structure <ref> [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] </ref> is useful for a variety of purposes in linguistic interpretation and generation, including the ability to determine the possible referents for a referring expression and the intentional relations between utterances. <p> Certain utterances such as "by the way", or "anyway", or "let's go back to" or "let's talk about" will signal a shift in segments, while other phenomena such as clarifications will signal changes in the structure by their information content. 10 intentional structure: A related structure (also described in <ref> [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] </ref>) has to do with why the speakers are engaging in the particular subdialogues how the subdialogues relate to the overall purposes of the conversation. <p> A second important assumption, borrowed from work on discourse in the ai tradition such as <ref> [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] </ref>, is that the process of disambiguation crucially involves information which is pragmatic in nature, such as the hierarchical relations between speech acts.

Reference-contexts: attempts until we gained a better understanding of the problems we had to face. 4.1 Episodic Logic The representation used by the Parser to represent the meaning of utterances is called Episodic Logic (el). el is an intensional situational logic developed as a semantic and knowledge representation for general NLU <ref> [Hwang and Schubert, 1993a; Hwang and Schu-bert, 1993b] </ref>. The most distinctive feature of el is its natural-language like expressiveness, aimed at meeting our stated requirements of expressive, derivational, and semantic adequacy.

However, this algorithm presupposes that tense operators and quantifiers have already been correctly scoped, and that referent determination can be done independently of scoping and tense deindexing.

Reference-contexts: In starting the trains project, the rhet knowledge representation system [Allen and Miller, 1991] seemed a good starting point for representing the plan and domain knowledge, having been used and developed in parallel with previous discourse [Allen et al., 1989], temporal reasoning <ref> [Koomen, 1990] </ref>, and plan recognition efforts [Miller, 1990] at Rochester. rhet provides theorem-proving (both forward and backward chaining inference), as well as type hierarchies and typed unification, equality and inequality reasoning, temporal reasoning, frame-like event representations, and an explicit hierarchical context mechanism for representing belief contexts, hypothetical reasoning and other modalities.

Reference-contexts: Given this emphasis on generality, it was important to let individual researchers bring to bear whatever representational theories and techniques seemed to them most promising for their subproblem. In this, our system differs from the SOAR project <ref> [Lehman et al., 1991] </ref> which is similar in its aims to build an integrated, multi-functional, language-using agent. The SOAR project uses a common knowledge representation and inference mechanism throughout.

Reference-contexts: Each rule in the grammar consists of a syntactic rule coupled with a corresponding semantic rule. This allows us to build the interpretation compositionally in the sense of Montague's semantics <ref> [Montague, 1973] </ref>. The parser is a chart parser which uses probabilities gathered from the trains corpus to choose which arc to expand next. A lexicon consisting of syntactic features and semantic expressions for 700 stems was 5 constructed by hand.

Reference-contexts: space extending another focus space on a stack, in our framework we have a situation extending another 21 situation; in this way we do not introduce an additional stack mechanism, and the processes of focus space construction and focus space shift can be modeled as reasoning processes, as discussed in <ref> [Poesio, 1993] </ref>. The rest of the syntax of the language used in crt is borrowed from el: thus we have lambda expressions, modifiers, kind-forming operators, and all the other tools discussed in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: The decision to integrate scope interpretation with other aspects of pragmatic interpretation reflects the thesis put forth in <ref> [Poesio, 1994] </ref> that the scoping preferences of human subjects result from the interaction of several discourse interpretation processes. Speech Act Analysis The speech act interpreter is responsible for determining what the speaker means by her utterance. <p> However, this algorithm presupposes that tense operators and quantifiers have already been correctly scoped, and that referent determination can be done independently of scoping and tense deindexing. For the trains system, we needed an integrated account of these processes. 4.2 CRT Conversation Representation Theory (crt) <ref> [Poesio, 1994] </ref> is an account of contextual interpretation and ambiguity resolution in conversations that builds on the theory of lexical semantics developed in Episodic Logic. <p> Instead, we illustrate the use of the implemented KR systems by means of a single example exchange from the conversation in Figure 2, sentences 7.1-7.2 through 8, repeated here as (6), for convenience. More details on how the rest of the dialogue is represented can be found in <ref> [Poesio, 1994] </ref>, for crt, [Traum, 1994], for ebtl, and [Ferguson, 1995], for the plan graphs.

Reference-contexts: Some of these are described briefly below. Unified Conversational Context Representation Given the experience of designing the individual modules and the interfaces, we are now in a position to meet head on the ontological differences springing from the different research traditions on discourse context representation. In <ref> [Poesio and Traum, 1995] </ref> we present the first steps, which alters crt to also allow representation of the aspects of conversational context represented in ebtl in the trains-93 system.

Reference-contexts: The precise nature of this type of structure and its relations to other types is still fairly controversial as can be seen in by the contributions in <ref> [Rambow, 1993] </ref>. situations: Non-linguistic information relevant for conversation is structured into coherent bundles or situations.

Reference-contexts: Space prevents a discussion of the rules actually used in the system; as a simple example of what a disambiguation rule might look like, here is how one could formulate a hypothetical rule assigning wide scope to operators in subject position. The rule is a "normal default rule" <ref> [Reiter, 1980] </ref>. Notice how the result of disambiguation is a partially disambiguated crt expression, with the universal quantifier taking scope over whatever operator occurs in the VP.

Reference-contexts: A lexicon consisting of syntactic features and semantic expressions for 700 stems was 5 constructed by hand. In addition, the Alvey lexicon (60,000 stems) and morphological analyzer (Kimmo-based segmenter combined with a unification-based chart parser) <ref> [Ritchie et al., 1992] </ref> were integrated with the trains sentence-level parser. However, the Alvey lexicon does not contain the fine-grained semantic information needed by the trains system and thus was only useful for its syntactic features which were mapped straightforwardly onto the trains syntactic features.

Reference-contexts: It will also shape the type of utterance that will be made, e.g., whether to use some kind of interrupting form or not. Turn-taking is also influenced by the overall initiative (or Control <ref> [Walker and Whittaker, 1990] </ref>), which is often related to the intentional structure. In the trains domain, the initiative is shared, with different participants holding it at different points in the conversation. In the initial phase, the user has the initiative while the task is conveyed.
