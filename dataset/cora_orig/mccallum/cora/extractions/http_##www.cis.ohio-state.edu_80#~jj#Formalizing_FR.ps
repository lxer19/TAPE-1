Author: John R. Josephson 
Note: The Functional Representation language (FR) was introduced by Sembugamoorthy and Chandrasekaran (1986), and subsequently developed by other researchers. FR can be formalized as follows:  allow the passage of Substances, which may be material (e.g., water), or abstract (e.g.,  whether or not it can be predicted as belonging to some malfunction state for which a representation has been given.

Abstract: The Functional Representation language introduced by Sembugamoorthy and Chandrasekaran, and subsequently developed by other researchers, is made more precise by formalizing it in terms of abstract data types. The ontology is clarified and made explicit. Distinctions scattered through the literature are reconciled and unified.

Reference-contexts: This way the FR representation qualitatively organizes the causal dependencies, with the numerical equations giving the precise details and the basis for calculations. This use of FR has been explored extensively by Sticklen and his colleagues <ref> (e.g., Sticklen, Kamel, & Bond, 1991) </ref> A state transition is what is accomplished, and its annotation explains how it is accomplished. Thus the transition represents a kind of role (the need to get from the one state to the other), and the annotation points to the role filler.
