Abstract: A measurable function x : J R ! X (X a metric space) is said to be C-meagre if C X is non-empty and, for every closed set K X with K " C = ;, x 1 (K) has finite Lebesgue measure. This concept of meagreness is shown to provide a unifying framework which facilitates a variety of characterizations, extensions or generalizations of diverse facts pertaining to asymptotic behaviour of dynamical systems.

Reference-contexts: the results on abstract semiflows are derived under the assumption that the underlying space X is a metric space, most of these results (in a suitably modified form) remain true if X is a topological space or, even more generally, a sequential-convergence space or a limit space (as adopted in <ref> [3] </ref>). 2 Notation and terminology Throughout, X denotes a metric space, with metric , R + := [0; 1) and J denotes a non-empty, measurable subset of R + . <p> Remark. An alternative derivation of the second part of statement (ii) (wherein x is assumed to be relatively compact) is possible, based on invariance principle due to Ball <ref> [3, Theorem 2.3, part (ii)] </ref>. This alternative derivation (not given here) is, however, nontrivial; the above approach seems to be more natural and direct. The following corollary (which has the flavour of the L p stability considerations in [23]) is a consequence of part (i) of Theorem 10. Corollary.

Since, by boundedness, x (t) approaches, as t ! 1, its non-empty, compact, invariant !-limit set , we also conclude that g 1 (0).
