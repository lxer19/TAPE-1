Abstract: This paper will appear in the BCS/IEE Distributed Systems Engineering Journal (Special Issue on Configurable Distributed Systems), 1995. Abstract Developing extensible, robust, and efficient distributed systems is a complex task. To help alleviate this complexity, we have developed the ADAPTIVE Service eXecutive (ASX) framework. ASX is an object-oriented framework composed of automated tools and reusable components. These tools and components help to simplify the development, configuration, and reconfiguration of applications in a distributed environment. Using the ASX framework, the services in the applications may be updated and extended without modifying, recompiling, relinking, or restarting the applications at run-time. This paper describes the features and object-oriented architecture of the ASX framework. It also describes how the ASX framework has been used to develop a highly modular, reusable, and dynamically reconfigurable family of distributed system management applications.
