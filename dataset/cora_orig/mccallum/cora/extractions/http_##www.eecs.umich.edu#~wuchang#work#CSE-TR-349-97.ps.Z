Abstract: The congestion control mechanisms used in tcp have been the focus of numerous studies and have undergone a number of enhancements. However, even with these enhancements, tcp connections still experience alarmingly high loss rates, especially during times of congestion. To alleviate this problem, the ietf is considering active queue management mechanisms, such as red, for deployment in the network. In this paper, we first show that even with red, loss rates can only be reduced marginally in times of congestion. We then show that the solution to this problem lies in decoupling congestion notification from packet loss through the use of explicit congestion notification (ecn) and in understanding the traffic generated by an aggregation of a large number of sources. Given this, we then propose and experiment with more adaptive active queue management algorithms (Adaptive red) and more conservative end-host mechanisms (subtcp) which can significantly reduce loss rates across congested links. When used together, these mechanisms can effectively eliminate packet loss while maintaining high link utilizations under the most difficult scenarios.

Reference-contexts: One of the reasons for high packet-loss rate is the failure of the network to provide early congestion notification to sources. This has led to proposals for active queue management, such as Random Early Detection (red) <ref> [1, 11] </ref> and variations thereof [16]. While red certainly outperforms traditional drop-tail queues, our experiments show that it is difficult to parameterize red queues to perform well under different congestion scenarios. <p> One form of active queue management being proposed by the ietf for deployment in the network is red (Random Early Detection) <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. red maintains an exponentially-weighted moving average of the queue length which it uses to detect congestion. When the average queue length exceeds a minimum threshold (min th ), packets are randomly dropped or marked with an explicit congestion notification (ecn) bit [8, 22, 23] with a given probability.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is important to avoid high packet-loss rates in the Internet. When a packet is dropped before it reaches its destination, all of the resources it has consumed in transit have been wasted. In extreme cases, this situation can lead to congestion collapse <ref> [12] </ref>. Over the last decade, tcp and its congestion control mechanisms have been instrumental in controlling packet loss and in preventing congestion collapse across the Internet. Optimizing the congestion control mechanisms used in tcp has been one of the most active areas of research in the past few years. <p> This stage is called slow-start and allows the source to double its congestion window, and thus its transmission rate, every round-trip time. In order to prevent excessive losses due to an exponentially-increasing transmission rate, tcp senders typically employ what is known as the congestion-avoidance algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. In this algorithm, tcp keeps track of a threshold value (ssthresh) which is a conservative approximation of the window size which the network can support. When the window size exceeds this threshold, tcp enters the congestion avoidance phase.

Reference-contexts: When the aggregate transmission rate of the active connections exceeds the network's capacity, queues build up and eventually packets are dropped. One way in which tcp detects a packet loss is through the receipt of a number of duplicate acknowledgments from the receiver <ref> [13] </ref>. Upon receiving a given number of duplicate acknowledgments, tcp infers that a packet loss has occurred and immediately halves its transmission rate by halving its congestion window. These mechanisms are called fast retransmit and fast recovery.

Reference-contexts: This does not appear to be a reason for serious concern at first glance. However, in many typical operating environments 3 this limitation in tcp's congestion control mechanism may lead to a high packet-loss rate <ref> [19] </ref>. tcp does, in fact, have a mechanism which allows it to transmit at a rate lower than one segment per round-trip time. When a single segment is transmitted and continually dropped, tcp doubles its retransmission interval until the segment has been delivered and acknowledged. <p> While fairness is a concern, even with tcp's current congestion control algorithm, fairness between connections has already been shown to be poor in times of congestion and among connections with varying round-trip times <ref> [10, 19] </ref>. In addition, the idealized model used in [3] assumes that congestion notification is given to all sources when the bottleneck resource becomes saturated. <p> This allows the network to maintain high degrees of efficiency without having to incur large queueing delays through the use of additional network buffers <ref> [19, 24] </ref>. The previous experiments fixed both the round-trip times and the percent bandwidth increase used (1 %). Since the performance of the proposed congestion control mechanisms have an inherent dependence on both, we ran several experiments which varied them.

Reference-contexts: Loss rates are especially high during times of heavy congestion, when a large number of connections compete for scarce network bandwidth. Recent measurements have shown that the growing demand for network bandwidth has driven loss rates up across various links in the Internet <ref> [21] </ref>. One of the reasons for high packet-loss rate is the failure of the network to provide early congestion notification to sources. This has led to proposals for active queue management, such as Random Early Detection (red) [1, 11] and variations thereof [16].

Reference-contexts: In lieu of explicit congestion notification, Equation (2) provides some insight on how to reduce loss rates. In particular, decreasing the segment size, increasing the bottleneck bandwidth, and increasing the round-trip times through the use of additional buffers <ref> [24] </ref> can slow the rate of congestion notification considerably and thus, decrease the amount of packet loss observed. Note that the dependence of packet-loss rates on round-trip times explains why red queues, which attempt to reduce network queueing delays, can potentially increase packet-loss rates (as observed in Figure 9). <p> This allows the network to maintain high degrees of efficiency without having to incur large queueing delays through the use of additional network buffers <ref> [19, 24] </ref>. The previous experiments fixed both the round-trip times and the percent bandwidth increase used (1 %). Since the performance of the proposed congestion control mechanisms have an inherent dependence on both, we ran several experiments which varied them.

Reference-contexts: Another reason packet loss occurs is that tcp traffic exhibits short-term burstiness which can make its offered load appear to be much larger than it actually is over short time periods <ref> [27] </ref>. Such burstiness can cause buffer overflow even when the overall offered load is below the bottleneck link capacity. Still, the key advantage of using bandwidth-based linear increases is that the behavior of its aggregate traffic is mostly independent of the number of connections present.
