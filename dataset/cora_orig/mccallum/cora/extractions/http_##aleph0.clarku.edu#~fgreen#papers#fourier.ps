Reference-contexts: Actually a stronger result is proved. Introducing terminology analogous to that of <ref> [ABFR] </ref>, say a polynomial weakly m-represents a Boolean function f if p is not a constant function and f (x 1 ; :::; x n ) = 0 =) p (x 1 ; :::; x n ) 0 (m). <p> The proof of the theorem is similar in spirit to that of Aspnes et al. <ref> [ABFR] </ref> (for parity versus perceptrons). A key difference is that we are working in a finite ring (Z=p k Z) with divisors of zero, and this requires much greater care in solving the linear equations as in the proof of [ABFR]. <p> is similar in spirit to that of Aspnes et al. <ref> [ABFR] </ref> (for parity versus perceptrons). A key difference is that we are working in a finite ring (Z=p k Z) with divisors of zero, and this requires much greater care in solving the linear equations as in the proof of [ABFR]. But the main idea is the same: we show that if we can "approximately" p k -represent parity well with a low-degree polynomial t, then we can weakly p k -represent it with a polynomial of degree less than n=2. <p> By the main theorem (with q=2), this is a contradiction. 10 The theorem described above is given after the following analogue of Lemma 2.1 of <ref> [ABFR] </ref>. The lemma is used to construct a polynomial which is zero on all the points of disagreement between parity and t. Lemma 11 Let m be any odd number. Let S f1; 1g n be such that jjSjj &lt; P l i where l &lt; n=2.

Reference-contexts: The topic of this paper was originally motivated by some questions about depth-three circuits involving both threshold and mod gates. As is well known, threshold and parity gates are a potent combination. Inspired by Toda's theorem [Tod] that PP PH PP P , Allender <ref> [Al] </ref> showed that any quasi-polynomial size "generalized perceptron," consisting of a threshold gate over AC (0) -type circuits, can be simulated by a quasi-polynomial-size depth-three circuit consisting of a threshold gate at the root, parity gates at the next level and AND gates of polylog fan-in connected to the inputs (which

Reference-contexts: In fact the best one can do, by Smolensky's theorem [Sm], is (n 1=2o (1) ) for threshold-of-Mod + q circuits computing parity (q an odd prime). Although this problem has not received as much press as the ACC problem <ref> [Bar] </ref>, it shares at least some of its difficulty. Some progress has been made in a restricted version of the problem in [CGT], in which the functions computed by the parity sub-circuits are symmetric.

Reference-contexts: Algebraic or combinatorial techniques other than those used in [Sm] or [Raz] appear to be necessary. Recently, progress has been made in the simple but important case of a single Mod m -gate over small AND's <ref> [BBR] </ref>, [Tsai]. This paper, for the most part, continues this line of investigation. Since this computational model is really based on polynomials, we formulate the problem accordingly. Let p : f0; 1g n ! Z be an integer polynomial, and q; m 2 be relatively prime natural numbers. <p> What is the minimum degree of p such that for all (x 1 ; :::; x n ) 2 f0; 1g n , p (x 1 ; :::; x n ) 0 (m) iff P n divisible by q? This question was studied by Barrington, Beigel and Rudich <ref> [BBR] </ref>, and, in subsequent work, by [Tsai]. The strongest lower bound, obtained by Tsai, states that the polynomial must have degree linear in n. Analysis of the proofs of these previous results shows that they are valid only if m is a constant or a slowly growing function of n. <p> Intuitively it would make sense that the degree lower bound has nothing to do with m's dependence on n, and is only due to the relative primality of q and m. However, it is not clear how the techniques of <ref> [BBR] </ref> and [Tsai] can be adapted to handle this more general case. In this paper we introduce an alternative technique which can. Here we therefore consider a generalization of the problems studied in [BBR], [Tsai]. <p> However, it is not clear how the techniques of <ref> [BBR] </ref> and [Tsai] can be adapted to handle this more general case. In this paper we introduce an alternative technique which can. Here we therefore consider a generalization of the problems studied in [BBR], [Tsai]. The most significant lower bounds will be for the modulo functions, Mod m;r (x 1 ; :::; x n ) = 0 if i=1 x i r (m) 1 otherwise, or their negations (for example, a Mod m gate computes the function Mod m;0 ). <p> Another application of this stronger version (in the special case of q = 2) is described below. The proof strategy is substantially different than those used in <ref> [BBR] </ref> and [Tsai]. We make use of the representation of Boolean inputs by complex roots of unity, introduced by Barrington and Straubing [BS]. There the goal was to show that the sign of p could not agree with Mod q;r .

In this paper we have succeeded in proving this only in the special case of q = 2 and even then it was necessary to assume m is a prime power.

We make use of the representation of Boolean inputs by complex roots of unity, introduced by Barrington and Straubing <ref> [BS] </ref>.

Related results, via similar techniques, for lower bounds on circuits consisting of one threshold over Mod q gates, have been obtained recently by Krause and Pudlak [KP]. <p> As in this previous work, the formulation in terms of roots of unity permits the application of the powerful technique of spectral analysis. The main difference between the setting here and that of <ref> [BS] </ref> and [KP] is that here we work in a finite ring (i.e., Z=mZ) rather than an infinite field (i.e., the complex numbers).

Let q be a natural number 2 and denote the primitive complex root of unity e 2i q (q will be fixed in this section). Let D = f1; ; 2 ; :::; q1 g. <p> Let d be the degree of the polynomial p. Suppose d &lt; b N 2 (q1) c. Then we will show that, under the given hypotheses, p is always zero mod m. Define , D; V as in the discussion above. Exactly as in <ref> [BS] </ref>, we restrict the input settings so that p can be regarded as a polynomial over inputs in D. <p> Group the N inputs into n sets of size q 1, each of the form fx (q1)i+1 ; :::; x (q1)i+q1 g with 0 i n 1. Let y 1 ; :::; y n be n inputs each taking on values in D. Define the polynomials mentioned in <ref> [BS] </ref> (though not written down explicitly), u j (y) = q i=0 l=j+1 for y 2 D and 1 j q 1. <p> Writing y i = s i for 1 i n, note that, q1 X x (q1)i+j = s i 1; and therefore, N X x i r (q) iff i=1 n Y y i = n+r : (3) Up to this point, the argument has followed the one given in <ref> [BS] </ref>. However we must now remember that we are working in Z=mZ, while the polynomials u j have coefficients which are not necessarily integers. Therefore instead of computing the polynomial p (x 1 ; :::; x N ) mod mZ, we compute it mod mZ.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that further investigation of the properties of polynomials in rings of algebraic integers may be fruitful. The open problems which seem most amenable to attack are related to the power of exact-of-ACC (p) circuits. General exact-of-ACC circuits have been considered previously by Beigel, Tarui and Toda <ref> [BTT] </ref>, who show that probabilistic exact-of-ACC circuits of quasipolynomial size can be simulated by circuits consisting of a symmetric gate over polylog fan-in AND's (called SYM + circuits). Thus any lower bounds for SYM + circuits are at least as hard as for probabilistic exact-of-ACC circuits.

Reference-contexts: Although this problem has not received as much press as the ACC problem [Bar], it shares at least some of its difficulty. Some progress has been made in a restricted version of the problem in <ref> [CGT] </ref>, in which the functions computed by the parity sub-circuits are symmetric. Here we consider a different kind of restriction: the parity sub-circuits are general, but the top gate is an "exact threshold" or "exact" gate (the resulting circuits are called "exact-of+" circuits).

But the results of section 5 yield random oracle separations of P from C = P Mod p P . <p> oracles (see [BenGil 81] and [Has]), we find, 14 Theorem 18 Relative to a random oracle A, for any odd prime p, P A 6 C = P Mod p P A It is known that relative to a random A, Mod p P PH A Mod p P A <ref> [Ta] </ref>. Using this, the above theorem gives the following stronger result (another proof follows from Theorem 14). Let Mod p PH denote the closure of P under the operations C 7! NP C and C 7! Mod p P C , which is the polynomial-time analogue of ACC (p).

Reference-contexts: The topic of this paper was originally motivated by some questions about depth-three circuits involving both threshold and mod gates. As is well known, threshold and parity gates are a potent combination. Inspired by Toda's theorem <ref> [Tod] </ref> that PP PH PP P , Allender [Al] showed that any quasi-polynomial size "generalized perceptron," consisting of a threshold gate over AC (0) -type circuits, can be simulated by a quasi-polynomial-size depth-three circuit consisting of a threshold gate at the root, parity gates at the next level and AND gates

Reference-contexts: Algebraic or combinatorial techniques other than those used in [Sm] or [Raz] appear to be necessary. Recently, progress has been made in the simple but important case of a single Mod m -gate over small AND's [BBR], <ref> [Tsai] </ref>. This paper, for the most part, continues this line of investigation. Since this computational model is really based on polynomials, we formulate the problem accordingly. Let p : f0; 1g n ! Z be an integer polynomial, and q; m 2 be relatively prime natural numbers. <p> degree of p such that for all (x 1 ; :::; x n ) 2 f0; 1g n , p (x 1 ; :::; x n ) 0 (m) iff P n divisible by q? This question was studied by Barrington, Beigel and Rudich [BBR], and, in subsequent work, by <ref> [Tsai] </ref>. The strongest lower bound, obtained by Tsai, states that the polynomial must have degree linear in n. Analysis of the proofs of these previous results shows that they are valid only if m is a constant or a slowly growing function of n. <p> Intuitively it would make sense that the degree lower bound has nothing to do with m's dependence on n, and is only due to the relative primality of q and m. However, it is not clear how the techniques of [BBR] and <ref> [Tsai] </ref> can be adapted to handle this more general case. In this paper we introduce an alternative technique which can. Here we therefore consider a generalization of the problems studied in [BBR], [Tsai]. <p> However, it is not clear how the techniques of [BBR] and <ref> [Tsai] </ref> can be adapted to handle this more general case. In this paper we introduce an alternative technique which can. Here we therefore consider a generalization of the problems studied in [BBR], [Tsai]. The most significant lower bounds will be for the modulo functions, Mod m;r (x 1 ; :::; x n ) = 0 if i=1 x i r (m) 1 otherwise, or their negations (for example, a Mod m gate computes the function Mod m;0 ). <p> As a by-product (see Corollary 6), we present a new proof that, if m is independent of n and is not a prime power, the minimal degree of a polynomial which m-represents the :Mod m function is (n), a result originally obtained in <ref> [Tsai] </ref>. Another application of this stronger version (in the special case of q = 2) is described below.
