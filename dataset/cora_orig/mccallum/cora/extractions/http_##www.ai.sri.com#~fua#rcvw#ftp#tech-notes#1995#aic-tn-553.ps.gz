Abstract: An approach is presented for imposing generic hard constraints on deformable models at a low computational cost, while preserving the good convergence properties of snake-like models. We believe this capability to be essential not only for the accurate modeling of individual objects that obey known geometric and semantic constraints but also for the consistent modeling of sets of objects. Many of the approaches to this problem that have appeared in the vision literature rely on adding penalty terms to the objective functions. They rapidly become untractable when the number of constraints increases. Applied mathematicians have developed powerful constrained optimization algorithms that, in theory, can address this problem. However, these algorithms typically do not take advantage of the specific properties of snakes. We have therefore designed a new algorithm that is closely related to Lagrangian methods but is tailored to accommodate the particular brand of deformable models used in the Image Understanding community. We demonstrate the validity of our approach first in two dimensions using synthetic images and then in three dimensions using real aerial images to simultaneously model terrain, roads, and ridgelines under consistency constraints.

Reference-contexts: the area of computer vision, one notable exception to the complexity problem is the approach proposed by Metaxas and Terzopoulos [ 1991 ] to enforce holonomic constraints 1 by modeling the second order dynamics of the system and stabilizing the constraint equations to prevent possible divergence using the Baumgarte method <ref> [ Baumgarte, 1972 ] </ref> . Solving the system only requires dealing with matrices whose size is proportional to the number of constraints m. In this work we propose a new approach to enforcing hard-constraints on deformable models without undue computational burden while retaining their desirable convergence properties.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding procedure is straightforward and easy to implement. Furthermore, this approach remains in the spirit of most deformable model approaches: they can also be seen as performing two steps, one attempting to fit the data and the other to enforce global constraints <ref> [ Cohen, 1995 ] </ref> . We view our contribution as the design of a very simple and effective constrained-optimization technique that allows the imposition of hard constraints on deformable models at a very low computational cost.

Reference-contexts: First, it is well known that minimizing an objective function that includes such penalty terms constitutes an ill-behaved optimization problem with poor convergence properties <ref> [ Fletcher, 1987, Gill et al., 1981 ] </ref> : the optimizer is likely to minimize the constraint terms while ignoring the remaining terms of the objective function. <p> However, while there are many such techniques, most involve solving large linear systems of equations and few are tailored to preserving the convergence properties of the snake-like approaches that have proved so successful for feature delineation and surface modeling. For example, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) <ref> [ Fletcher, 1987 ] </ref> is widely recognized as one of the most powerful such techniques but updating the Lagrange multipliers requires solving a full (n + m) fi (n + m) potentially ill-conditioned linear system|n being the number of state variables, normally much larger than m the number of constraints. <p> For example, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) <ref> [ Fletcher, 1987 ] </ref> is widely recognized as one of the most powerful such techniques, and we outline it in appendix. However, in our experience, it has a number of drawbacks for our specific application: * The functions we try to optimize have severe nonconvexities. <p> Appendix: SQP, a Lagrange-Newton Algorithm We summarize the optimization method presented in <ref> [ Fletcher, 1987 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: can be rewritten as K S S t + ff (S t S t1 ) = @S fi fi S t1 @E fi fi fi : (13) In practice, ff is computed automatically at the start of the optimization procedure so that a prespecified average vertex motion amplitude is achieved <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1990 ] </ref> . The optimization proceeds as long as the total energy decreases. When it increases, the algorithm backtracks and increases ff, thereby decreasing the step size.

Reference-contexts: For 3-D surfaces, we use an objective function that is the sum of a stereo term and a shape-from-shading term. As their behavior and implementation have already been extensively discussed elsewhere, we only describe them briefly and refer the interested reader to our previous publication <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1995 ] </ref> . The stereo component of the objective function is derived by comparing the gray levels of the points in all the images for which the projection of a given point on the surface is visible.

Reference-contexts: For 2-D linear features, E (S) is the average value of the edge gradient along the curve. For 3-D linear features, E (S) is computed by projecting the curve into a number of images, computing the average edge-gradient value for each projection and summing these values <ref> [ Fua, 1995 ] </ref> . For 3-D surfaces, we use an objective function that is the sum of a stereo term and a shape-from-shading term.

To illustrate the behavior of this method, we reuse the image of Figure 7 and introduce a "distance" constraint between two snakes.
