Abstract: We describe a new direct method for estimating structure and motion from image intensities of multiple views. We extend the direct methods of [9] to three views. Adding the third view enables us to solve for motion, and compute a dense depth map of the scene, directly from image spatio-temporal derivatives in a linear manner without first having to find point correspondences or compute optical flow. We describe the advantages and limitations of this method which are then verified with experiments using real images.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction We present a new method for computing ego-motion and dense structure from three views. This method can be viewed as an extension of the 'direct methods' of Horn & Weldon <ref> [9] </ref> from two views (one motion) to three views (two motions). These methods are dubbed 'direct methods' because they do not require prior computation of optical flow. Within a coarse-to-fine implementation our method can handle displacements averaging up to 50 pixels for 640fi 480 resolution images. <p> Yet, our method produces a full 3D model of the scene as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (e,f). 1.1. Previous Work The 'direct methods' were pioneered by Horn & Weldon in <ref> [9] </ref>. Using only a single image pair one has N equations in N +6 unknowns, where N is the number of points in the image, thus additional constraints are needed. Negahdaripour & Horn [12] present a closed form solution assuming a planar or quadratic surface. <p> s; v are defined below: s = @ I y 1 and 0 I y y (xI x + yI y ) xI y yI x A (11) Given the solution to the ego-motion parameters (to be described later), one can recover the dense depth map from the following equations <ref> [9] </ref>: ks &gt; t 0 + v &gt; w 0 + I 0 ks &gt; t 00 + v &gt; w 00 + I 00 where K = 1 z denotes the inverse depth at each pixel location.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Fermuller & Aloimonos [4] describe global geometric properties of the flow-field that give rise to direct relationships between the measurement of normal flow and the ego-motion parameters solved by means of search techniques. This work is based on the work of Shashua & Hanna <ref> [16] </ref>. Here we describe the results of implementing these ideas in practice. During the course of implementation various subtleties and limitations were discovered. 2. Mathematical Background Let x be a point in 3D space and its projection in a pair of images be p and p 0 . <p> Thus, as a first-order approximation to the camera motion model, we obtain a constraint equation involving the unknowns ff jk i and the spatio-temporal derivatives at each pixel the constraint is linear in the unknowns. This constraint was introduced by <ref> [16] </ref> under the name Tensor Brightness Constraint. This is briefly derived next. Let ax 0 + by 0 + = 0 define a line coincident with p 0 .
