Abstract: This report explores the problem of dynamically computing visual relations in connectionist systems. It concentrates on the task of learning whether three clumps of points in a 256x256 image form an equilateral triangle. We argue that feed-forward networks for solving this task would not scale well to images of this size. One reason for this is that local information does not contribute to the solution: it is necessary to compute relational information such as the distances between points. Our solution implements a mechanism for dynamically extracting the locations of the point clusters. It consists of an efficient focus of attention mechanism and a cluster detection scheme. The focus of attention mechanism allows the system to select any circular portion of the image in constant time. The cluster detector directs the focus of attention to clusters in the image. These two mechanisms are used to sequentially extract the relevant coordinates. With this new representation (locations of the points) very few training examples are required to learn the correct function. The resulting network is also very compact: the number of required weights is proportional to the number of input pixels.

Reference-contexts: The locations of interest are determined by external networks and can include top-down as well as bottom up information. (In our current implementation we use a cluster detector to detect the vertices. See Section 4.) In the next few sections we describe the details of our system. 1. See <ref> (Chapman, 1990) </ref> for an implementation which removes this restriction somewhat. Implementing a Focus of Attention 4 Locally Tuned Receptive Fields We first describe a mechanism by which linear threshold units can give a localized response in a feature space.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that a combination of bottom-up and top-down information is used to decide where to focus attention. (Shulman et. al, 1979) have provided evidence that the region of inuence moves continuously from one point to another. <ref> (Eriksen & Yeh, 1985) </ref> have shown that attention is allocated at only one contiguous region in any given instance but suggest that the area of inuence can vary continuously in size. There have also been neurophysiological studies showing that some neurons can dynamically change their response properties.

Reference-contexts: However, since region selection is based on local competition, the time required before the network stabilizes on a single region is quite sensitive to different images. It could be quite large if there are several similar regions of activity which are widely separated in the image. <ref> (Fukushima, 1986) </ref> describes a model of selective attention which combines aspects of the above two systems. His system consists of a log-depth hierarchical network in which the output level contains one unit per pattern.

Reference-contexts: The spatial relationships which define equilateralness will have to be discovered for each position, scale, and orientation of the triangle. Techniques have been proposed for introducing translation and rotational invariance into networks <ref> (Giles et. al., 1987) </ref> which eliminate the need for independent feature detectors at every location. Unfortunately these methods require that every unit have a lar ge (quadratic) number of connections with complicated weight linkages between them.

Reference-contexts: The library of primitives must be expanded to handle more features of realistic images. We would need to extract relations based on curves, regions, shapes, etc., and so would need the appropriate primitives. For example, <ref> (Jolicoeur et. al, 1986) </ref> have provided evidence that people use a curve-following routine to determine whether two points lie on the same curve.

Reference-contexts: Implementing a Focus of Attention Along with these discoveries a number of detailed models have been proposed for implementing selective attention. In the next section we briey review the most relevant ones and then describe our mechanism. 3.1 Previous work <ref> (Koch and Ullman, 1985) </ref> have suggested a model based on a saliency map combined with a pyramidal winner-take-all network. The saliency map consists of a retinotopic grid of neurons which accumulate bottom-up information from various feature maps. <p> The error vector representation was inspired by discoveries of a similar mechanism in the monkey superior colliculus for controlling eye saccades (Sparks, 1986). The output of the confidence units are similar in spirit to the saliency map in <ref> (Koch & Ullman, 1985) </ref>. In general many factors may contribute to the saliency of a given location. In our implementation the saliency is simply the number of active points within the receptive field passed through a sigmoid. <p> This structure is used to send control signals to successive binding networks. 0.5 0.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Signal Cntrl-1 Cntrl-2 Cntrl-3 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 - +1 Signal cntrl-1 fires cntrl-2 fires cntrl-3 fires (a) A r Simulation 10 depth network as in <ref> (Koch and Ullman, 1985) </ref> to explicitly compute the maximum. In our current implementation we assume a unit with a built in max function but are studying other schemes for performing this computation efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Chapman (1990) has extended the model to allow pointer addressing. To move the focus to an arbitrary location an address is routed from the top of the pyramid down to the appropriate leaf. The value at that leaf is then passed up the tree to the root node. <ref> (Mozer, 1988) </ref> has described a model of selective attention which eliminates the need for a log-depth tree. His attentional mechanism (AM) consists of a layer of retinotopic units. The layer receives input from all the feature maps.

Reference-contexts: The focus can be shifted to the nearest location by selecting the location with the smallest error vector. The error vector representation was inspired by discoveries of a similar mechanism in the monkey superior colliculus for controlling eye saccades <ref> (Sparks, 1986) </ref>. The output of the confidence units are similar in spirit to the saliency map in (Koch & Ullman, 1985). In general many factors may contribute to the saliency of a given location.

Reference-contexts: Evidence for Sequential Visual Processing in the Brain There is a large body of psychology literature which supports the idea of sequential visual routines. One of the best examples is the work by Treisman and her colleagues <ref> (Treisman & Gormican, 1988) </ref>. Their work suggests that certain simple visual tasks are performed by people in parallel (response time is independent of the number of objects in the image) whereas other tasks require serial processing (response time is linear in the number of objects). <p> The focus of attention mechanism itself is independent of the actual image and could work in any real-valued space. The system should be easily adaptable for general visual search of the type discussed in <ref> (Treisman & Gormican, 1988) </ref> which requires the ability to isolate regions in different feature maps. Minimal hardware is required to adapt our system work with orientation selective neurons, color detectors, etc.
