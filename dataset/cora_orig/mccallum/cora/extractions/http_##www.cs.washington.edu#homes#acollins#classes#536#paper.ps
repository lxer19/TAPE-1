Reference-contexts: The easiest way to argue this point is simply to quote the masters themselves. Perhaps the best compilation of the fallacy of making long-range predictions about our abilities to factor large numbers comes from BYTE magazine <ref> [Sch95] </ref> In 1976, Richard Guy wrote: "I shall be surprised if anyone regularly factors numbers of size 10 80 without special form during the present century." In 1977, Ron Rivest said that factoring a 125-digit number would take 40 quadrillion years. In 1994, a 129-digit number was factored.

More recently (March 1991 [RSAFAQ]), RSA has released a series of challenge numbers, a series products of two large primes, ranging from 100 to 500 digits in length, in 10 digit increments. <p> Both have proven useful in practice, and most of the recent factoring projects have used the "double large prime" variant of the algorithm (with the multiplier). The precise descriptions of these modifications given below are from <ref> [AGLL94] </ref> The multiplier modification adds a first step of selecting a multiplier m such that mN is a quadratic residue mod many small primes. <p> field of cryptography was the success ful crypanalysis of the RSA-129 challenge message, given in 1977 (see above). 6 The message was extracted in 1994 after an extensive effort to harness approx-imately 4000 to 6000 MIPS-years of computing power from idle machines on the internet to factor the public modulus <ref> [AGLL94] </ref>. <p> This works well only if jlog ( n 2 n 1 )j is small, which means in practice that it will in general allow us to predict a few digits into the future. In <ref> [AGLL94] </ref>, they used this approximation, starting from the 116 digit factorization above (400 MIPS-year) to predict that 120 digits would take 950 MIPS-years. As we can see in the table, The actual factorization took 825 MIPS-years. <p> Even so, if the internet community wanted to factor a 512 bit number, it should not be impossible to find 160,000 machines worth of idle time (especially if one were willing to approach corporations rather than just individuals). At the end of the Squeamish Ossifrage paper (still <ref> [AGLL94] </ref>), the authors figure that they could acquire 100,000 machines with neither superhuman nor unethical methods, and that it is not at all unreasonable to undertake a project requiring 500,000 MIPS-years. 6 Towards the future Factoring has long been regarded as an important problem in applied number theory, and has had,

For this effort, sieving over 13 million polynomials (the terminology seems to use polynomials basically interchangeably with the congruences described above, depending on the exact variant of the algorithm) yielded 48,665 full, 884,323 partial, and 5,056,835 double partial relations. The partial and double partials yielded 203,557 usable combinations. <p> An algorithm which took L N [1; b] would be a purely exponential algorithm. All of the modern algorithms fall somewhere in between, quadratic sieve (all variations) takes L N [ 1 2 ; 1], while the general number field sieve takes L N [ 1 3 ; 1:923] <ref> [DDLM93] </ref>. Thus GNFS is asymptotically a faster algorithm (in fact, asymptotically it is currently the fastest known algorithm), however, quadratic sieve (in current implemenatations at least) is still faster for small numbers, say less that 100 digits.

Reference-contexts: the recent factorizations, we would be 3 dealing with astronomical numbers of trial divisions (really modulus operations, where we are looking for x such that N j 0 (mod x)). 3.2 Pollard's rho heuristic One heuristic technique that has been applied to factoring for many years is Pol-lard's rho heuristic <ref> [CLR] </ref>. Where trial division required p N divisions to factor N, using Pollard's rho heuristic, we can expect only 4 p N divisions.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the basic number field sieve is designed to work on numbers of the form r e s, where r and s are both small (and e is potentially large). The basic idea of the general number field sieve, as described in <ref> [BLP91] </ref>, is that we will perform our sieving in a special field that we construct. First, we choose an irreducibile polynomial f 2 Z [x] (of "small, but not too small" degree), and a zero of that polynomal ff.

Reference-contexts: Basically, the two popular techniques appear to be operator input (which of course would be a significant barrier to the practical use of the algorithm, since it requires so much expertise on the part of the operator), and automated trial and error, which has worked well for Dodson and Lenstra <ref> [DL95] </ref>. Their technique is to find a small number of candidate pairs of polynomials, and then sieve on all of them in parallel for a while, observing the yield rates. <p> For For a long time, it was believed that the cross-over point was much higher than that, somewhere in the range of 200 digits, which is well beyond current feasibility. This however, is starting to change as we learn more about the nature of the GNFS. Results in <ref> [DL95] </ref> indicate that, due to some observed behaviors in their system as the sieve progressed, the crossover point is now below 115 digits, and that the RSA-129 effort could have been done in about 1 4 of the time that the quadratic sieve required, using this GNFS implementation. 5.1 Extrapolating based

Reference-contexts: They have temporarily shelved investigation of this however, because the trial and error approach seems to work. 4.5 Factoring using elliptic curves One other approach of interest is the application of elliptic curve groups to factoring. The algorithm, due to Lenstra <ref> [Ste85] </ref>, is based on Pollards p-1 method, but uses the availability of a large number of applicable elliptic groups to find one which will work well in the application.
