Reference-contexts: See Ruda, Farkas, and Abriata <ref> [1] </ref> for a more complete discussion of this mathematical model. 1.2 Variations in Setup The sequential code being studied in this research was written by Yuri Mishin. It simulates structures with several variations. First of all, different types of atoms can be used.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the original code, an average of 97 percent of the time spent in the CG phase is spent in energy and force evaluation. The conjugate gradient algorithm is described in more detail by Gill, Murray, and Write <ref> [2] </ref>. Brian Blount Chapter 1. Introduction 6 1.3.3 Symmetry Symmetry is a term used to describe a simple trick that improves the performance of the original code.
