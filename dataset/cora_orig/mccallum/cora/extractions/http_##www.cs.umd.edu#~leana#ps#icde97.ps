Abstract: To design a cost effective VOD server, it is important to carefully manage the system resources so that the number of concurrent viewers can be maximized. Previous research results use data sharing techniques, such as batching [5], buffering [12], and piggybacking [7], to reduce the demand for I/O resources in a VOD system. However, these techniques still suffer from the problem that additional I/O resources are needed in the system for providing VCR functionality without careful resource management, the benefits of these data sharing techniques can be lost. In this paper, we first introduce a model for determining the amount of resources required for supporting both normal playback and VCR functionality to satisfy predefined performance characteristics. Consequently, this model allows us to maximize the benefits of data sharing techniques. Furthermore, one important application of this model is its use in making system sizing decisions. Proper system sizing will result in a more cost-effective VOD system.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the viewer is said to join the partition, and the resources allocated in phase 1 can be released. Otherwise, the viewer has to continue utilizing the resources allocated in phase 1 until he can join a partition, for instance, using the piggy backing technique <ref> [1, 7, 9] </ref>. Note that the allocation of resources in phase 1 is usually inevitable. On the other hand, whether or not these allocated resources can be released depends on the resuming position.
