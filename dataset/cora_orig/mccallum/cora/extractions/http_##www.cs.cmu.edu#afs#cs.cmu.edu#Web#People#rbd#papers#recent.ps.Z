Reference-contexts: Virtual time can also be stopped: set_rate (slowbase, 2 &lt;< 8); /* half speed: */ set_virttime (slowbase, 2000); set_rate (slowbase, STOPRATE); Each timebase maintains a queue of events that are scheduled for the future. (Dannenberg, 1989a) The queue is maintained using the heapsort algorithm <ref> (Aho, 1974) </ref> which is much faster than the linear search employed in the previous version of Moxc. Time is now maintained with a resolution of 1ms versus the 10ms time unit of the previous version of Moxc.

Reference-contexts: The interactive computer music composition Ritual of the Science Makers uses both computation and stored sequences to respond to live instruments. The CMU Midi Toolkit is currently being used to develop conducting and score-following software <ref> (Bloch, 1985, Dannenberg, 1988) </ref>. 6. Acknowledgments The CMU Midi Toolkit has been developed with the help of Dean Rubine, John Maloney, Jean-Christophe Dhellemmes, Joe Newcomer, and George Logeman.

Reference-contexts: The intent of the system is to support experimental computer music composition, research, and education (Dannenberg, 1984), rather than to compete with commercial music systems. The CMU Midi Toolkit is especially useful for building interactive real-time systems <ref> (Chabot, 1986) </ref> and for creating non-traditional scores, which might include non-standard tunings, mulitiple tempi, or time-based rather than beat-based notation. (Dannenberg, 1986) 1.1. Adagio: A Text-Based Score Language One of the main components of the CMU Midi Toolkit is the score language Adagio.

Adagio: A Text-Based Score Language One of the main components of the CMU Midi Toolkit is the score language Adagio. Unlike the numerous screen-based sequencers now available on personal computers, Adagio is a text-based system. Adagio tends to be more flexible and open-ended than most sequencers.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction to the CMU Midi Toolkit The CMU Midi Toolkit is a software system that provides an easy-to-use interface to Midi, a standard interface for music synthesizers <ref> (Loy, 1985) </ref>. The intent of the system is to support experimental computer music composition, research, and education (Dannenberg, 1984), rather than to compete with commercial music systems.
