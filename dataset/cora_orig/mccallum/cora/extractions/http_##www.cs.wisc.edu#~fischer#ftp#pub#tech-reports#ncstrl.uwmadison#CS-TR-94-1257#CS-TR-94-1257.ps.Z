Abstract: The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely used in lossy image and video compression schemes such as JPEG and MPEG. In this paper we describe RD-OPT, an efficient algorithm for constructing DCT quantization tables with optimal rate-distortion tradeoffs for a given image. The algorithm uses DCT coefficient distribution statistics in a novel way and uses a dynamic programming strategy to produce optimal quantization tables over a wide range of rates and distortions. It can be used to compress images at any desired signal-to-noise ratio or compressed size.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Discrete Cosine Transform <ref> [ANR74] </ref> lies at the heart of most commonly used lossy image and video compression schemes [PM93, MP91]. The extent of compression achieved depends upon the coarseness of quantization of the transform coefficients. The coarser the quantization, the lesser the entropy of the quantized coefficients. <p> Thus, increasing the entries in Q tends to decrease the rate. We denote the rate resulting with the use of a particular quantization table Q as R (Q). DCT has the nice property of being very close to the Karhunen-Loeve-Hotelling tranform, a transform that produces uncorrelated coefficients <ref> [ANR74] </ref>. The lack of correlation between coefficients allows the rate to be decomposed as a sum of contributions from individual coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The most common of these is to use a default table and scale it up or down by a scalar multiplier to vary quality and compression. We have shown in [RL94] that this might not give the best tradeoff possible.

In this paper we present RD-OPT, an efficient algorithm for optimum quantization table design that does not rely on visual or rate-distortion models.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Discrete Cosine Transform [ANR74] lies at the heart of most commonly used lossy image and video compression schemes <ref> [PM93, MP91] </ref>. The extent of compression achieved depends upon the coarseness of quantization of the transform coefficients. The coarser the quantization, the lesser the entropy of the quantized coefficients. But coarse quantization also leads to poor quality of the decompressed image. <p> For better visual quality, it is sometimes useful to to do adaptive quantization which gives more bits for encoding regions in the image that are perceptually more significant. This is done in MPEG by scaling the quantization table up or down on a per-macroblock basis <ref> [MP91] </ref>. Thus, for any block f, the quantization 8 table used is Qqscale f , where Q is a nominal quantization table and qscale f is a factor that depends upon the macroblock containing f .

The extent of compression achieved depends upon the coarseness of quantization of the transform coefficients. The coarser the quantization, the lesser the entropy of the quantized coefficients. But coarse quantization also leads to poor quality of the decompressed image. <p> The block ^ f Q is entropy-coded, using (for example) Huffman codes to exploit similarities across blocks, to give the compressed block E ( ^ f Q ) <ref> [PM93] </ref>. The sequence of these compressed blocks forms the compressed image. The decompression process reverses these steps as follows: 1. Each entropy-coded block E ( ^ f Q ) is decoded to get the corresponding block of quantized coefficients ^ f Q . 2.

Reference-contexts: DCT has the nice property of being very close to the Karhunen-Loeve-Hotelling tranform, a transform that produces uncorrelated coefficients [ANR74]. The lack of correlation between coefficients allows the rate to be decomposed as a sum of contributions from individual coefficients. It has been shown in <ref> [RFVK94] </ref> that the coefficient-wise average of entropies of the quantized DCT coefficients is a very good estimate of the rate resulting from two-pass Huffman coding of runlengths. This allows us to approximate R (Q) as a sum of rates of individual coefficients. <p> In practice, the error is never more than 0:02 dB. The total error in R (Q) is at most 64 fi 0:5=BPPSCALE plus the error in estimating rate as the coefficient-wise sum of entropies. The latter component is usually around 0.01-0.05 bits per pixel <ref> [RFVK94] </ref>. 5 Performance results We have implemented RD-OPT in C on various platforms. Figure 2 shows the performance of RD-OPT running on an IBM POWERstation 370.

Reference-contexts: We now briefly describe the basic steps used in DCT-based image compression and decompression, and thereby present some notation. Details on various standards can be found in the standard documents. Details on DCT itself can be found in <ref> [RY90] </ref>. Let I be a W fi H image with pixel values in the range [0 : : : M ]. The DCT-based compression process consists of the following steps. 1. The image is divided into 8 fi 8 blocks.

Reference-contexts: A key feature of the algorithm is that it simultaneously optimizes quantization tables over a wide range of rates and distortions. 2 Image compression based on the Discrete Cosine Transform The human visual system is not very sensitive to sudden changes in intensity across an image <ref> [VB67] </ref>. Lossy image compression techniques strive to discard that part of the image structure which is less perceptible to the eye. The two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (referred to hereafter as DCT) offers an efficient way to break up the underlying structure of an image into different spatial-frequency components.
