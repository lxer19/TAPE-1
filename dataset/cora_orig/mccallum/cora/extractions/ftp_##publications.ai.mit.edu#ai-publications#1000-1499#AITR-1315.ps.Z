Title: Why are There so Few Female Computer Scientists?  
Author: c Ellen Spertus 
Abstract: Women pursue education and careers in computer science far less frequently than men do. In 1990, only 13% of PhDs in computer science went to women, and only 7.8% of computer science professors were female. Additionally, the percentage of female computer science students appears to be increasing at only a slow rate or even decreasing. Apart from ethical concerns at women's lack of participation in computer science, the demographics of the country are such that the United States will not have enough engineers and scientists unless underrepresented groups increase their participation. This report examines the influences against a woman's pursuing a career in a technical field, particularly computer science. Such factors include the different ways in which boys and girls are raised, the stereotypes of female engineers, subtle biases that females face, problems resulting from working in predominantly male environments, and sexual biases in language. Finally, I discuss effective and ineffective ways to encourage women. A theme of the report is that women's underrepresentation is not primarily due to direct discrimination but to subconscious behavior that tends to perpetuate the status quo. This report is expected to become an MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Technical Report.

Reference-contexts: of the men, for example, in our society have to get a job, 50 and, say, only 50 percent of the women are going to get it, and they have a limited number they will take in, aren't they warranted in taking nine out of ten men and fewer girls?' <ref> [Abramson 1975, page 74] </ref> With attitudes like this, clearly some sort of program is needed. 4.1.2 Distrust of Qualifications As mentioned earlier, many people consciously or unconsciously have lower expectations of women. This is exacerbated by affirmative action.

A report on a study, "What's Wrong With This Picture?", commissioned by Women in Film and the National Commission on Working Women. The report found that men have more leading roles than women and that women continue to be portrayed in a stereotyped manner. </title>
Reference-contexts: How would you feel? Not only are these positions held by men, but the media propagate stereotypes of women. A recent study found that "women are often still depicted on television as half-clad and half-witted, and needing to be rescued by quick-thinking, fully clothed men" <ref> [Adelson 1990] </ref>. Whether or not people realize it, many of their expectations of men and women are based on what they have observed and by what messages their culture presents. As one Usenet 4 reader wrote: This group [comp.society] has been discussing various stereotypes for a long time now.

Reference-contexts: When I was a sophomore, people told me I would get into 6-A [the industry co-op program] easier because I was female. When I applied for permanent jobs, I was told companies would hire me just because I was female <ref> [Anu 1990] </ref>. As noted in [Anu 1990], hearing such statements repeatedly can harm a woman's self-esteem and cause her to question her ability. No feminist I have spoken with has favored admitting less-qualified women to university positions. <p> When I was a sophomore, people told me I would get into 6-A [the industry co-op program] easier because I was female.

Reference-contexts: Fifteen percent of the graduate students and twelve percent of the undergraduates reporting harassment consequently changed their academic plans because of it. Most did not report the incidents [Simeone 1987, page 115-116]. Other studies, such as <ref> [Baker 1990] </ref> find even higher percentages of women sexually harassed.

Reference-contexts: In one survey, female graduate students at MIT "reported that foreign-educated faculty | many from cultures where women are not held in high esteem | pose problems for women in graduate programs, both in class and in research" ([MIT 1987] in <ref> [Baum 1990, page 49] </ref>). 15 1.2.4 Career-Related Success Unfeminine Not only are some strong traits considered unfeminine, but "femininity and individual achievement continue to be viewed as two desirable but mutually exclusive ends," a shocking position argued in [Horner 1970, page 46], based on empirical research and interviews. <p> In practice, women often do not get encouragement from teachers and guidance counselors ([Cooper Union 1989] in <ref> [Baum 1990, page 48] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: joke] to my [male] office-mate. 2.2.2 Attempts at Changing Behavior Some computer science graduate students and staff at Carnegie Mellon were sufficiently disturbed by the display of nude pictures as backgrounds on computer terminals that they got together and tried to change the situation by publicly appealing to the community. <ref> [CMU 1989] </ref> is a fascinating report describing their appeal and the friendly and hostile reactions. <p> People who are offended will interpret such displays as derogatory, even if that is not your intent. We therefore ask you to refrain from using them out of respect for those who are offended, even if you believe the offended people are just overly sensitive <ref> [CMU 1989, page 2] </ref>. The appeal closed by making clear that they were not advocating banning such displays but were requesting that people voluntarily remove them out of sensitivity to others. Responses about the appropriateness of the displays and of the appeal were mixed and are categorized in the report. <p> In response to the criticism that individuals should complain personally, several women wrote that "[w]omen asking for changes in behavior individually are exposed to ridicule and abuse" <ref> [CMU 1989, page 4] </ref>. This point was echoed by a woman quoted in a paper about the "Garden", a laboratory in the MIT Media Lab: [W]hen comments are made about the offensive nature of the music or movies, they are often ignored, or belittled, or are chortled at. <p> In less clear-cut but nevertheless offensive situations, this option is often not open. While acting as a group and writing a report was effective for women at MIT [MIT 1983] and Carnegie-Mellon <ref> [CMU 1989] </ref>, often women must react individually to behavior they find unacceptable. 67 Reacting to Subtle Discrimination As discussed in Section 1.2.1, women are often the victims of subtle subconscious bias.

Unfortunately, as the interviewer goes on to report, "these comments were chosen not because they were unique but because they represented all too commonly the attitudes of the counselors in many schools". <p> this will help you boys who fix your own bicycles, so pay attention!'
