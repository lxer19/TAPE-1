(eds.), </editor> <publisher> Akademia Kiado, </publisher> <address> Budapest. </address>
Reference-contexts: Although the procedure is a little naive, it does show that existing work on pragmatics in epistemic/doxastic logic ([Thijsse 1992], section 6.4) and on the representation of natural language ([Kamp 1981], <ref> [Ahn and Kolb 1990] </ref>, section 6.3) can be brought together in the MPTS-framework (section 6.5). Besides, it will serve as a guideline for further discussion (section 6.6). 6.1. Contexts as growing information states In [Ahn 1992] a type theoretical approach to user modelling in man-machine communication is proposed. <p> These structures are then interpreted in a model through a truthful embedding. In this section we shall not go into the construction nor into the embedding of DRSs, since our main concern is the relation of (already constructed) DRSs to type theory. In <ref> [Ahn and Kolb 1990] </ref> a formal translation is given from DRSs into type theoretical contexts: each DRS corresponds to a `segment' (a small pseudo-context). <p> The difference between the interpretations lies in the way each reader ankers characters, locations etc. occurring in the text by substituting them with persons and places from his own mental state. On a more technical level, <ref> [Ahn and Kolb 1990] </ref> discusses anchoring of a segment in the context of the interpreter as the proof theoretical analogon of the embedding of a DRS in a model. 6.4. Epistemic pragmatics Reasoning about information states of (other) agents plays an important role in communication. <p> It would require the substitutions of referents from the hearer-context for referents in the segment, as well as the substitution of proofs (occurring in, or derivable on the hearers context) for the proof variables in the segment (cf. <ref> [Ahn and Kolb 1990] </ref>). More in general, this form of anchoring is likely to be of importance in formalizing the effect of other speech acts, like questions, on the information state of the hearer.

Reference-contexts: Besides, it will serve as a guideline for further discussion (section 6.6). 6.1. Contexts as growing information states In <ref> [Ahn 1992] </ref> a type theoretical approach to user modelling in man-machine communication is proposed. Central to this proposal is the idea that the information state of an agent (animate or inanimate) can be modelled by a type theoretical context. <p> In chapter 6, we did a finger exercise in the type theoretical formalization of communication to show how MPTSs fit in with existing ideas on this subject, like those in <ref> [Ahn 1992] </ref>. The rule AddUtt was proposed, giving a procedure for the `update' of the information state of a hearer-agent by a declarative utterance of a speaker-agent, in the MPTS 2PRED2.

Reference-contexts: The so-called `substructural' modal logics are based on fragments of intuitionistic logic. Their interpretation in modal type theory would be of interest with respect to applications in linguistics, i.e. categorial grammar (see <ref> [Van Benthem 1991b] </ref>, [Morill 1990], [Morill 1992]). In MPTSs the `logic rules' are the original PTS-rules, acting on generalized contexts. These rules can be varied independently of the import/export-rules and the transfer-rules, and it is this variation that creates the Modal Logic Cube.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, this is not sufficient for the applications we are interested in. One possibility to increase the potential for temporal reasoning in MPTSs would be to try to accommodate (some of the) more sophisticated temporal operators that have been developed since [Prior 1967] (cf. <ref> [Van Benthem 1983] </ref>). A more intrinsically type theoretical approach would be to `decorate' proof objects with temporal information, hence giving proofs a `limited shelf life'.

Reference-contexts: to the intuitionistic logic HK 2 (<ref> [Bozic and Dosen 1984] </ref>). This logic is a true subsystem of the logic K , and has only one modal operator: `2'. In intuitionistic modal logic, the operator `3' can not be defined in terms of `2'. Possibility has to be dealt with independently, [Bozic and Dosen 1984] gives separate axiomatizations and models for an intuitionistic 3-logic (HK 3) and a system with both modalities (HK 32).

Reference-contexts: Although a number of side conditions given in [De Queiroz and Gabbay 1992] are not particularly new to lambda calculus (for the relevance condition see <ref> [Church 1951] </ref>), their effect has yet to be studied systematically in the PTS-framework. Another approach is taken in [Wansing 1993], where a propositions-as-types interpretation via sequent calculi is given for a whole family of substructural logics that are part of intuitionistic propositional logic.

Reference-contexts: This so-called `Converse Barcan Formula'(28x 2 D:'(x ) oe 8x 2 D:2'(x )) becomes provable when variables that are declared in the main proof may be used in the strict subordinate proof, a rule which is already used (implicitly) in <ref> [Fitch 1952] </ref>. In the type system corresponding to the natural deduction system 2PRED2 (section 5.1.1), this rule for the use of variables falls out naturally as `transfer 3 '.

CONCLUDING REMARKS (sequents) to occur at different `levels'. The function of these levels is comparable to that of modal subordinate proofs in Fitch-style deduction: formulas can only change their level by means of the `modal rules', 2-introduction and 2-elimination.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, this extension to multi-agent and multi-modal deduction is satisfactory: by generalizing the additional import rules to cases with three modal operators, we find a deductive characterization of the classes of `inspection formulas' given model theoretically in <ref> [Van der Hoek 1992] </ref>. In modal predicate logic, there is less conformity between Fitch-style deduction and model theory.

Reference-contexts: Interpreting these logics requires a (preferably Fitch-style) natural deduction account of intuitionistic possibility, which in spite of recent developments 2 does not seem to be available at the moment. There exist epistemically interesting intuitionistic logics in which the modal operators are duals (cf. <ref> [Jaspars 1994] </ref>). In these so-called `Nelson logics', duality between `2' and `3' is restored by introducing an extra negation in intuitionistic logic, under which the operators are interdefinable. However, for these logics there are currently also no natural deduction systems that would make their interpretation straightforward.

Reference-contexts: CONCLUDING REMARKS (non-monotonic) phenomena without some type theoretical notion of time. The same holds for the type theoretical representation of `tense and aspect' in natural language. In the current MPTSs, we can interpret the simple Tense Logic of <ref> [Prior 1967] </ref>. This logic has operators G (it is always Going to be the case that), H (it always Has been the case that), P (somewhere in the Past, it was the case that), and F (somewhere in the Future, it will be the case that). <p> Clearly, this is not sufficient for the applications we are interested in. One possibility to increase the potential for temporal reasoning in MPTSs would be to try to accommodate (some of the) more sophisticated temporal operators that have been developed since <ref> [Prior 1967] </ref> (cf. [Van Benthem 1983]). A more intrinsically type theoretical approach would be to `decorate' proof objects with temporal information, hence giving proofs a `limited shelf life'.

Reference-contexts: In the PTS-framework, little work has been done on the interpretation of substructural logics. Nevertheless, there is quite a lot of work on lambda calculi and term calculi for these logics. Some of the ideas developed therein may be applicable to (M)PTSs. In <ref> [De Queiroz and Gabbay 1992] </ref> an extension of the propositions-as-types interpretation to substructural logics is proposed, based on conditions on lambda abstraction. Abstraction corresponds to oe-intro, and in substructural logics there are various restrictions on this operation. <p> Although a number of side conditions given in <ref> [De Queiroz and Gabbay 1992] </ref> are not particularly new to lambda calculus (for the relevance condition see [Church 1951]), their effect has yet to be studied systematically in the PTS-framework.

Reference-contexts: An approach completely different from ours can be found in <ref> [De Queiroz and Gabbay 1995] </ref>, where a functional Curry-Howard interpretation of modal logics in Labelled Deduction Systems 1 is proposed. The basic idea is to regard the modal operator `2' as a second order universal quantification: 2A j 8W :A (W ).

Reference-contexts: This idea can be taken up in various ways. A grand but illustrative perspective is that of Ranta who is particularly interested in the representation of literary texts. In <ref> [Ranta 1989] </ref>, anchoring is seen as the process that can account for the fact that every reader of literary work has his own interpretation, even though there exists a (DRT-like) canonical type theoretical representation.

Reference-contexts: Temporality Another direction in which the MPTS-framework should be extended has to do with temporality. In the information state of an agent reasoning about a changing domain, beliefs that were initially correct can become false, and vice versa. It is difficult to deal with such 2 In <ref> [Simpson 1993] </ref> proof systems are given for a family of intuitionistic modal logics, but these are hybrid systems: in the proofs both formulas and relational conditions on worlds (like `xRy') can occur as items. 208 CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: The general advice to `try to make your contribution one that is true' is then specified further in two maxims: Belief Do not say what you believe to be false. Evidence Do not say something for which you lack sufficient evidence. In <ref> [Thijsse 1992] </ref>, the `epistemic force' that is attributed to (declarative) utterances through the quality maxims is analyzed in terms of epistemic/doxastic logic. This analysis results in the following proposal for an `utterance rule'. <p> It is also impossible for the hearer to prove that the speaker believes that Pedro beats Jerry, since the context contains no evidence that the speaker is aware of the donkey-ownership rule. Hence in this example the AddUtt-rule seems cautious enough. Although the epistemic transfer rule in <ref> [Thijsse 1992] </ref> was not intended for epistemic predicate logic, and the fragment of DRT covered so far does not have a construction rule for intensional verbs like `to believe' or `to know', we now try to find out what happens to the 6.5. ADDING DECLARATIVE UTTERANCES 199 Moore-sentences under AddUtt. <p> The rule AddUtt was proposed, giving a procedure for the `update' of the information state of a hearer-agent by a declarative utterance of a speaker-agent, in the MPTS 2PRED2. Although the proposed rule is too naive, it does show that existing work in epistemic pragmatics (i.e. <ref> [Thijsse 1992] </ref>) can be brought to type theory using the developed modal framework. The discussion of this rule (section 6.6) indicates that a more serious type theoretical account of communication may require further technical development of the non-modal part of the MPTSs.

Another approach is taken in <ref> [Wansing 1993] </ref>, where a propositions-as-types interpretation via sequent calculi is given for a whole family of substructural logics that are part of intuitionistic propositional logic. At the core of this family of logics lies a `split' notion of implication: a distinction is made between `left-searching' and `right-searching' implication.
