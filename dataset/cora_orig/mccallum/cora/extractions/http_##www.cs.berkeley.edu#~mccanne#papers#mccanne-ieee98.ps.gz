Title: Scalable Multimedia Communication with Internet Multicast, Light-weight Sessions, and the MBone  
Author: Steven McCanne 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: In this survey article we describe the roots of IP Multicast in the Internet, the evolution of the Internet Multicast Backbone or MBone, and the technologies that have risen around the MBone to support large-scale Internet-based multimedia conferencing. We develop the technical rationale for the design decisions that underly the MBone tools, describe the evolution of this work from early prototypes into Internet standards, and outline the open challenges that remain and must be overcome to realize a ubiquitous multicast infrastructure. We 1 and others in the MBone research community have implemented our protocols and methods in real applications and have deployed a fully operational system on a very large scale over the MBone. This infrastructure including our audio, video, shared whiteboard tools and protocols is now in daily use by the large and growing MBone user and research communities and the success and utility of this approach has resulted in commercialization of many of the underlying technologies.

Reference-contexts: INRIA released their video conferencing tool, ivs, an integrated audio/video conferencing system that relies exclusively on H.261 <ref> [1] </ref> for video compression. In the fall of 1992, Schulzrinne released an MBone audio tool similar to vat called nevot [95]. This tool was the principal development vehicle for the earliest versions of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [97], now the IETF standard for Internet packet audio.

Reference-contexts: We briefly describe one such system architecture the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) H.320 audio/video conferencing system to provide a counterpoint to the LWS design philosophy. H.320 defines compression formats, bit-stream syntax, and channel-coding algorithms for multimedia communication over point-to-point ISDN lines <ref> [2] </ref>. While well suited to small-scale conferencing like point-to-point video phone calls or small 7 multipoint meetings, the H.320 architecture does not scale gracefully beyond a few tens of sites.

Reference-contexts: The natural extension of H.320 for multipoint communication is simply to enhance the point-to-point protocols with multipoint negotiation and to add new services within the network that multiplex and filter streams. Such services have, in fact, been defined by the ITU (e.g., H.243 <ref> [3] </ref>) and the agents within the network that implement these services are called Multipoint Control Units (MCU). In this MCU-based communication architecture, small conferences are typically deployed by manually configuring a single MCU in a star-shaped topology.

Reference-contexts: Despite these hard problems, work on application-level gateway architectures has shown promise and such systems have been used to support real user communities at non-trivial scale <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.2 Receiver-driven Layered Multicast To overcome the limitations of the gateway architecture, several researchers have proposed an end-to-end approach based on receiver-driven adaptation that moves the burden of rate-adaptation from the source or the network to the receivers [26, 70, 103, 110, 15, 30, 51, 71, 103, 17].

Reference-contexts: For instance, payload format specifications define how H.261, Motion-JPEG, and MPEG bit streams are framed in RTP packet streams. Finally, a payload format may be further decomposed into a hierarchy, e.g., as indicated in layered video formats like PVH [73], LDCT <ref> [6] </ref>, and HVQ [107, 16]. (The refinement of these experimental layered video formats into Internet standards is an active area of research and is currently under development.) A key goal in RTP is to provide a very thin transport layer without overly restricting the application designer.

Reference-contexts: This video gateway architecture was first fully developed and fielded by Amir et al. <ref> [7] </ref> in a specific application called vgw, which provided design feedback for the RTP specification and contributed an efficient software-based method for transcoding high-rate Motion-JPEG video into low-rate H.261.

Reference-contexts: Because of U.S. export restrictions, the MBone tools are distributed with a trivial-to-break exclusive-or cipher; otherwise, Triple DES with cipher-block chaining is typically used for secure communication. Since the MBone tools and RTP were defined before the IP Security Protocol (IPSEC) <ref> [8] </ref> was in place, they include their own mechanism for security. Eventually, RTP security may be superseded by lower-layer security protocols. 23 Once all participants in a session have the requisite en-cryption key, encrypted communication is trivial.

Reference-contexts: A number of multicast routing protocols compute spanning trees from an anchor point in the network (either the sending host or a rendezvous point or core) to all of the receivers, e.g., Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [28], Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [108], or Core Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [9] </ref>. Because the anchor point (i.e., source address) uniquely identifies the spanning tree, multicast routers can determine the forwarding action for any given packet by consulting that packet's source address.

Reference-contexts: A common criticism of best-effort networks like the Internet is that they cannot effectively support real-time traffic, and instead, the prevailing wisdom holds that new mechanisms for controlling quality of service are required (e.g., RSVP [113], ST-II [14], or Tenet <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> Since RTP is independent of the underlying network technology, it simultaneously supports multiple network protocols. Figure 5 illustrates how RTP fits into several protocol stacks. For IP and IP Multicast, RTP is layered over UDP, while in the Tenet protocols, it runs over RMTP/RTIP <ref> [10] </ref>. 9 the underlying transport protocol. This feature of RTP has allowed tools like vic and vat to be successfully deployed over a variety of network transports, including the Tenet Real-time Message Transport Protocol (RMTP) [10], the ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL5), and, the most commonly used configuration, UDP over IP and <p> Multicast, RTP is layered over UDP, while in the Tenet protocols, it runs over RMTP/RTIP <ref> [10] </ref>. 9 the underlying transport protocol.

Similarly, applications can run directly over an ATM Adaptation Layer.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, our experience implementing the RTP payload specification for H.261 led to an improved scheme based on macroblock-level fragmentation, which resulted in a revised protocol [104]. Finally, the RTP payload specification for JPEG <ref> [11] </ref> evolved from a vic implementation. More recent additions to the MBone application suite include the Network Text Editor, nte [46], and the Robust Audio Tool, rat [48], both developed by researchers at the University College London.

Reference-contexts: Unlike many traditional works in reliable multicast, the approach in the IP Multicast community, and in particular SRM, does not attempt to guarantee any semantics for message delivery order. Protocols like ISIS <ref> [12] </ref>, HORUS [106], Totem [79], and RMP [109] all support the notion of causal message ordering (i.e., all events triggered by message arrivals obey Lamport's notion of happens before [62]) as well as global message ordering (i.e., the same message order is seen by all receivers).

Reference-contexts: Thirty-two isolated multicast sites spread over four countries were configured into a large virtual multicast network, which in turn was used to audiocast the 23rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting. The virtual network backbone used to glue together the multicast-capable sub-networks was dubbed the Multicast Backbone, or MBone <ref> [13] </ref>. For the first time, IETF participants were able to attend working group meetings and participate in the conference from a distance. Despite a few technical difficulties, the experiment proved enormously successful.

Reference-contexts: Provisioning real-time network service can then be viewed as an incremental optimization that is deployed in the network only when and where needed. * Soft State. Many LWS applications, application protocols, and network protocols exploit soft state <ref> [18] </ref> based on the announce/listen metaphor [93]. In this model, each session member periodically announces its presence and/or a state binding by multicasting a message to the group. In turn, receivers tune into the group, listen to the announcements, and assemble the announced state. <p> Note that this announce/listen style of protocol relies chiefly upon soft state <ref> [18] </ref>. That is, session information retained at each member site eventually expires but is continuously refreshed by the announcement process. If, for instance, a network partition occurs, the protocol continues to function normally. When the partition heals, the announce/listen protocol simply restores the state across the reformed session.

Reference-contexts: In 1990, Clark and Tennenhouse proposed that an application's semantics should be reflected in the design of its network protocol to better optimize that application across the network and into the end-system <ref> [19] </ref>. 8 About the same time that Clark and Tennenhouse proposed ALF, the work on the MBone tools was just getting under way. After several design iterations over transport protocols for several different audio/video compression formats, it became clear that a one size fits all protocol was inadequate [38, 69].

By June, weekly research meetings among the DARTNet participants were held using NVP audio and the DARTNet multicast infrastructure. Because vt was a pioneering research prototype that focused principally on network research issues, little effort went into developing its user interface.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, in addition to packet loss in the network, messages can be lost in the end-system when the decoder cannot keep up with a high-rate incoming bit stream. In response, the decoder could gracefully trade off reconstruction quality to shed work <ref> [22, 34] </ref>. However, such adaptation is difficult under the temporal prediction model because the decoder must fully decode all differential updates to maintain a consistent prediction state. In contrast, with conditional replenishment, compute-scalability is both feasible and simple.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, we can view resilient source-coding as a manifestation of joint source/channel coding (JSCC), a well-developed concept from formal communications theory. JSCC states that one can often achieve better system performance by combining the design of compression and error-control coding rather than treating these sub-problems independently <ref> [23] </ref>. Garrett and Vetterli [42, 43] first applied this terminology to packet networks by viewing the packet transport mechanism as the channel-coding algorithm. In his thesis, Garrett argues that real-time traffic is better served by jointly designing the compression algorithm with the transmission system [41].

Reference-contexts: Though several works have attacked this problem, none of them offer a truly scalable solution <ref> [24, 85, 75] </ref>. Dynamic security for multicast remains an area of active research. A much simpler but less versatile mechanism has been designed for the MBone and LWS [58]. Under this model, encryption of the session announcement protocol is combined with that of the media transport channels.

Here administrative scopes are imposed by configuring administrative boundaries at the borders between organizations.

Reference-contexts: While this architecture supports heterogeneous transmission, it does not provide a mechanism for end-systems to adapt dynamically to the available capacity in the network. Instead, MMC relies on admission control to explicitly allocate available bandwidth to heterogeneous receivers. The CU-SeeMe system <ref> [31] </ref> from Cornell University distributes video over a manually configured multicast distribution mechanism. So called reflectors are manually placed throughout the network to effect a multicast distribution tree using native unicast transmission. Receivers generate loss reports that are sent back up the distribution tree via the reflectors.

Reference-contexts: However, by adequately sizing the address space, we can make the probability of collision vanishingly small. Unfortunately, the practical range of IPv4 multicast addresses is limited and this limitation is exacerbated by the Birthday Problem <ref> [32] </ref>. Complete analysis of these problems and their solutions is still open research and the overall address allocation architecture is undergoing revision in the IETF. With this infrastructure in place, a session directory client can contact a local session directory agent and request a list of all known sessions.

This pathological behavior is known as the ACK implosion effect <ref> [33] </ref>. We can reduce the impact of ACK implosions by using negative acknowledgments (NACKs) rather than positive ACKs. Here, a receiver generates a NACK only when it detects missing data.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, in addition to packet loss in the network, messages can be lost in the end-system when the decoder cannot keep up with a high-rate incoming bit stream. In response, the decoder could gracefully trade off reconstruction quality to shed work <ref> [22, 34] </ref>. However, such adaptation is difficult under the temporal prediction model because the decoder must fully decode all differential updates to maintain a consistent prediction state. In contrast, with conditional replenishment, compute-scalability is both feasible and simple.

Reference-contexts: In this group-oriented communication framework, senders need not know explicitly about receivers and receivers need not know about senders. Instead, a sender simply transmits packets to an IP group address and receivers inform the network (via the Internet Group Management Protocol or IGMP <ref> [35] </ref>) of their interest in receiving packets sent to that group. Moreover, the process by which receivers join and leave multicast groups is reasonably timely and efficient.

Reference-contexts: After several design iterations over transport protocols for several different audio/video compression formats, it became clear that a one size fits all protocol was inadequate <ref> [38, 69] </ref>. Instead, a framework based on ALF emerged where a thin base protocol defines the core mechanisms and profile extensions define application-specific semantics. A common misconception surrounding ALF is that each time an application is built, the programmer must design and implement that application's protocol entirely from scratch. <p> In short, such applications require a reliable multicast transport protocol. Unfortunately, reliable multicast is a difficult problem. Though a number of wide-area reliable multicast protocols have been proposed <ref> [65, 38, 64] </ref>, none currently satisfies the requirements for safe deployment in the global Internet because no existing scheme simultaneously provides (1) scalability to very large multicast sessions, (2) congestion control that accommodates constrained and potentially heterogeneous link bandwidths, and (3) a rich and configurable range of reliability semantics. <p> In fact there are many possible solutions with important variations and tradeoffs and the approach described in <ref> [38] </ref> proposes not a specific solution for reliable multicast, but rather a a framework that enables the construction of customized protocols tailored to specific applications in a reusable fashion. <p> SRM includes a mechanism for adapting these tradeoffs dynamically; measurements of the frequency of duplicate responses are used to adjust the randomized delay interval. The performance tradeoffs associated with adjusting the timer distributions are discussed in the original SRM paper <ref> [38] </ref> as well as in more recent work [89, 83]. <p> Local Recovery. The network research community is actively pursuing two approaches to combat the adverse effects of uncorrelated packet loss. The first approach, originally proposed in <ref> [38] </ref>, is called local recovery. In local recovery, the reach of a request or retransmission is confined to some localized region of the network, e.g., using the IP Multicast scoping controls described in x2.4. <p> In this fashion the loss recovery traffic is spatially localized to a confined region of the network and the overall protocol scales without impacting the global performance across the session. The research community is actively experimenting with different forms of local recovery, e.g., using TTL-scopes <ref> [38] </ref> or multiple multicast groups [67], but no scheme has yet been deployed or even studied at large scale or under realistic conditions. FEC Multicast. <p> Yet even this simple check cannot be used in SRM, where an arbitrary receiver responds to a NACK and thus can easily alter the contents of the retransmission. To counteract this and maintain the integrity of original transmission, <ref> [38] </ref> proposes that sensitive data be signed with a cryptographic hash derived from the sender's public key. While this basic approach has been discussed for some years in the research community, to our knowledge it has never actually been implemented in a reliable multicast application.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, IP Multicast and its scalability have been heavily exploited in the design of a number of end-to-end protocols and multicast applications such as real-time media transport of audio and video with accompanying control information (e.g., vat [57], rat [48], vic [69], nv <ref> [40] </ref> and ivs [101]); reliable multicast transport of persistent data that underlies shared tools like whiteboards and text editors (e.g., wb [68] and nte [46]) and session directories to create and announce the existence of multicast sessions (e.g., sdr [44]). <p> Our approach called Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) is detailed in x5.

Reference-contexts: The resulting network architecture, where thin application-level protocols are built on top of IP Multicast and its powerful group concept, has been dubbed the Light-weight Sessions (LWS) architecture to empha 1 size its light-weight, loosely-coupled, and decentralized communication model <ref> [55] </ref>. In LWS, the collection of multicast senders and receivers, communicating within one or more interdependent multicast groups, and their respective protocols and protocol instances are collectively called a session. <p> Consequently, vt's text-based interface was cumbersome and provided limited user control and feedback. To improve upon vt, we elaborated ISI's work with new algorithms for counteracting network packet jitter through receiver buffering and playback point estimation <ref> [55] </ref> and enhanced the tool with a graphical user interface. Our new application became the LBL Visual Audio Tool, vat, and the DARTNet community gradually began using our new tool upon its release in the fall of 1991 2 . <p> To ground this discussion with details of a specific playback point algorithm, we now describe the delay adaptation algorithm employed in vat. This formulation is based on Ja-cobson's description in <ref> [55] </ref>. <p> In addition to counteracting network jitter, the delay adaptation algorithm can be exploited to provide cross-media synchronization by aligning each individual media stream with the stream that has the maximal playback point <ref> [55] </ref>. For example, if the video playback delay were 103ms and the audio playback delay were 63ms, then we could adjust the audio playback upward to 103ms and thus easily achieve audio/video synchronization. <p> Instead, the LWS directory service currently uses a scheme called informed, partitioned, random allocation <ref> [55] </ref>. In this scheme, addresses are randomly allocated (the random part) within each scope (the partitioned part), but known conflicts are explicitly avoided (the informed part). In effect, the allocation scheme is intertwined with the announcement protocol to provide conditional information for collision avoidance. <p> This model of receiver orchestrated coordination and control is elaborated to some extent in <ref> [69, 55] </ref>. In addition to privacy controls, a comprehensive security architecture must also include mechanisms for authentication. Otherwise, an adversary could subvert a group communication by masquerading as another session member.

Here administrative scopes are imposed by configuring administrative boundaries at the borders between organizations. A special block of multicast addresses is reserved for administrative scope and since administratively scoped traffic does not flow across boundaries, scoped addresses need not be unique across organizational boundaries.

Reference-contexts: In LWS, group management is implicit. Unlike many traditional conference management schemes, there is no protocol for controlling access to the group or for maintaining a consistent group view at each receiver. Privacy, for instance, is achieved not through access control, but instead through end-to-end encryption <ref> [58] </ref>. Similarly, conference control mechanisms are effected through the receiver orchestration techniques discussed in [69]. <p> Though several works have attacked this problem, none of them offer a truly scalable solution [24, 85, 75]. Dynamic security for multicast remains an area of active research. A much simpler but less versatile mechanism has been designed for the MBone and LWS <ref> [58] </ref>. Under this model, encryption of the session announcement protocol is combined with that of the media transport channels. Here, a user registers a set of keys with a session agent or session directory tool like sdr.

For unicast transmission, a source can use Path MTU Discovery <ref> [60, 77] </ref> to learn the maximum transmission unit allowed along a certain unicast path through the network.

Reference-contexts: In short, such applications require a reliable multicast transport protocol. Unfortunately, reliable multicast is a difficult problem. Though a number of wide-area reliable multicast protocols have been proposed <ref> [65, 38, 64] </ref>, none currently satisfies the requirements for safe deployment in the global Internet because no existing scheme simultaneously provides (1) scalability to very large multicast sessions, (2) congestion control that accommodates constrained and potentially heterogeneous link bandwidths, and (3) a rich and configurable range of reliability semantics. <p> In contrast, SRM makes no such guarantees; messages can arrive in any order. The only guarantee is that each message is eventually delivered to all interested receivers. This model is often called concurrent reliable multicast <ref> [64] </ref> because message delivery is asynchronous and the order non-deterministic; thus in Lamport's terminology all events are concurrent. And because the burden of ensuring reliability is placed on receivers in SRM, a receiver that is not interested in some data need not request retransmission.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is to retransmit error-correcting codes rather than the original data itself so that a distinct packet loss or losses in distinct areas of the network can be simultaneously repaired with a single packet. This simultaneous repair mechanism utilizes (n; k) block codes <ref> [66] </ref>. Here, a packet stream is grouped into platoons of n packets each, and whenever a loss is detected the receiver NACKs the platoon rather than the packet.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, IP Multicast and its scalability have been heavily exploited in the design of a number of end-to-end protocols and multicast applications such as real-time media transport of audio and video with accompanying control information (e.g., vat [57], rat [48], vic <ref> [69] </ref>, nv [40] and ivs [101]); reliable multicast transport of persistent data that underlies shared tools like whiteboards and text editors (e.g., wb [68] and nte [46]) and session directories to create and announce the existence of multicast sessions (e.g., sdr [44]). <p> Privacy, for instance, is achieved not through access control, but instead through end-to-end encryption [58]. Similarly, conference control mechanisms are effected through the receiver orchestration techniques discussed in <ref> [69] </ref>. This style of conference management is often characterized as loosely-coupled control because explicit synchronization among group members is unnecessary. 3.1 The Real-time Transport Protocol While LWS provides a framework for group communication, it does not specifically define the details of how session members intercommunicate. <p> IP service interface there must exist specific transport protocols and data formats to facilitate communication as well as methods for mapping these data formats onto multicast transmission channels. Through our work on the MBone tools <ref> [69, 57] </ref> and other similar efforts [101, 39, 94, 95], the following communication model emerged. An LWS session is a collection of end-hosts that communicate using a particular, somehow agreed upon, set of IP Multicast group addresses. <p> After several design iterations over transport protocols for several different audio/video compression formats, it became clear that a one size fits all protocol was inadequate <ref> [38, 69] </ref>. Instead, a framework based on ALF emerged where a thin base protocol defines the core mechanisms and profile extensions define application-specific semantics. A common misconception surrounding ALF is that each time an application is built, the programmer must design and implement that application's protocol entirely from scratch. <p> While a great deal of research has focused on many variants and hybrids of these three core approaches <ref> [112, 48, 4, 52, 82, 91, 25, 102, 69, 40] </ref>, the predominant scheme exploited in the MBone tools is that of resilient source coding because of its simplicity, low delay, and amenability to low-complexity implementation. <p> allows us to easily modify the source-coding algorithm to match the channel (i.e., JSCC) and likewise to modify the application data representation to match the underlying network (i.e., ALF). 3.5.2 RTP Video One example of the ALF/JSCC design process is our formulation of the RTP-based Intra-H.261 packet video compression format <ref> [69] </ref>. Our goal was to design a video compression algorithm for RTP that could cope with the burst erasures of Internet packet loss. As with TCP, separation does not work well here because burst erasures require many packets in order to construct burst loss-resilient codes, thereby increasing end-to-end delay substantially. <p> This model of receiver orchestrated coordination and control is elaborated to some extent in <ref> [69, 55] </ref>. In addition to privacy controls, a comprehensive security architecture must also include mechanisms for authentication. Otherwise, an adversary could subvert a group communication by masquerading as another session member.

Reference-contexts: For instance, payload format specifications define how H.261, Motion-JPEG, and MPEG bit streams are framed in RTP packet streams. Finally, a payload format may be further decomposed into a hierarchy, e.g., as indicated in layered video formats like PVH <ref> [73] </ref>, LDCT [6], and HVQ [107, 16]. (The refinement of these experimental layered video formats into Internet standards is an active area of research and is currently under development.)

Reference-contexts: This problem is crystallized by the classic end-to-end argument, which says that it is best to secure data transmission on an end-to-end basis since, in a multi-stage design, the system is only as strong as its weakest link, and moreover, trust must be reflected through all interfaces in the system <ref> [92] </ref>. To this end, the MBone tools and the LWS architecture utilize end-to-end symmetric-key encryption for privacy. The RTP and RTCP session announcement standards include datagram padding for block ciphers and features to protect against known plain-text attacks, and hence, they are well suited for encryption.

Reference-contexts: Second, extensive experience and experiments with unicast packet audio in the late seventies and early eighties offered an existence proof that packet audio was both feasible and practical.

Reference-contexts: We can view RTP as composed of a number of sub-component specifications roughly arranged in a class hierarchy to support the Application Level Framing architecture without sacrificing specification and implementation re-use.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the reasoning that leads us to ALF-based design, we propose an anecdotal design of an Internet unicast video delivery system. Under the premise of modularity (and Shannon's separation principle <ref> [98] </ref>), such a system might be designed using TCP for the channel-coding algorithm and H.261 for the source-coding algorithm. Although each of these schemes has been independently optimized and performs extremely well in its targeted environment, they interact poorly together.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, IP Multicast and its scalability have been heavily exploited in the design of a number of end-to-end protocols and multicast applications such as real-time media transport of audio and video with accompanying control information (e.g., vat [57], rat [48], vic [69], nv [40] and ivs <ref> [101] </ref>); reliable multicast transport of persistent data that underlies shared tools like whiteboards and text editors (e.g., wb [68] and nte [46]) and session directories to create and announce the existence of multicast sessions (e.g., sdr [44]). <p> IP service interface there must exist specific transport protocols and data formats to facilitate communication as well as methods for mapping these data formats onto multicast transmission channels.

Reference-contexts: Turletti and Bolot <ref> [103] </ref> describe an architecture based on this model where video gateways are placed throughout the network to transcode portions of the multicast distribution tree into a lower bit-rate coding either through format conversion or requantization. <p> have been used to support real user communities at non-trivial scale [5]. 4.2 Receiver-driven Layered Multicast To overcome the limitations of the gateway architecture, several researchers have proposed an end-to-end approach based on receiver-driven adaptation that moves the burden of rate-adaptation from the source or the network to the receivers <ref> [26, 70, 103, 110, 15, 30, 51, 71, 103, 17] </ref>. In this approach, the source signal is represented in a hierarchical format and its constituent layers are striped across distinct multicast groups. In turn, receivers adjust their reception rate by controlling the number of groups they receive.

Reference-contexts: As RTP evolved, we tracked and implemented protocol changes, and fed back implementation experience to the design process. Moreover, our experience implementing the RTP payload specification for H.261 led to an improved scheme based on macroblock-level fragmentation, which resulted in a revised protocol <ref> [104] </ref>. Finally, the RTP payload specification for JPEG [11] evolved from a vic implementation. More recent additions to the MBone application suite include the Network Text Editor, nte [46], and the Robust Audio Tool, rat [48], both developed by researchers at the University College London. <p> This approach was taken in early versions of Turletti and Huitema's RTP Payload Format Specification for H.261 <ref> [104] </ref>, but it had several shortcomings: (i) A GOB does not necessarily fit within a packet and often must be fragmented across multiple packets.

Reference-contexts: Turletti and Huitema proposed such a loss-adaptive source-coding technique where the interval of intra-mode block updates (i.e., the amount of rate allocated to redundancy) is controlled by observations of the network <ref> [105] </ref>. When packet loss rates are low, then the coder uses a large intra-mode interval; when loss rates are high, a small interval is used. At the extreme, intra-only coding is used.

Reference-contexts: Unlike many traditional works in reliable multicast, the approach in the IP Multicast community, and in particular SRM, does not attempt to guarantee any semantics for message delivery order. Protocols like ISIS [12], HORUS <ref> [106] </ref>, Totem [79], and RMP [109] all support the notion of causal message ordering (i.e., all events triggered by message arrivals obey Lamport's notion of happens before [62]) as well as global message ordering (i.e., the same message order is seen by all receivers).

Reference-contexts: For instance, payload format specifications define how H.261, Motion-JPEG, and MPEG bit streams are framed in RTP packet streams. Finally, a payload format may be further decomposed into a hierarchy, e.g., as indicated in layered video formats like PVH [73], LDCT [6], and HVQ <ref> [107, 16] </ref>. (The refinement of these experimental layered video formats into Internet standards is an active area of research and is currently under development.) A key goal in RTP is to provide a very thin transport layer without overly restricting the application designer.

Reference-contexts: A number of multicast routing protocols compute spanning trees from an anchor point in the network (either the sending host or a rendezvous point or core) to all of the receivers, e.g., Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [28], Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [108] </ref>, or Core Based Trees (CBT) [9]. Because the anchor point (i.e., source address) uniquely identifies the spanning tree, multicast routers can determine the forwarding action for any given packet by consulting that packet's source address.

Reference-contexts: Hence, loss neighbor-hoods are likely to cluster toward the leaves of the distribution tree nearer the edge of the network. In fact, recent experimental work shows that such loss neighborhoods actually occur in the MBone and, as a result, loss patterns across loss neighborhoods tends to be uncorrelated <ref> [111] </ref>. As the number of loss neighborhoods grows (i.e., as the session gets larger across the wide area), the aggregate probability that a given packet is lost by at least one loss neighborhood approaches one.

Reference-contexts: A common criticism of best-effort networks like the Internet is that they cannot effectively support real-time traffic, and instead, the prevailing wisdom holds that new mechanisms for controlling quality of service are required (e.g., RSVP <ref> [113] </ref>, ST-II [14], or Tenet [10]).

Reference-contexts: RTP, however, is living proof that this need not be the case. The solution is to cast the protocol not as a layer in the traditional layered protocol architectures like OSI <ref> [114] </ref>, but rather as a tree-based hierarchy of interdependent protocols as depicted in Figure 4.
