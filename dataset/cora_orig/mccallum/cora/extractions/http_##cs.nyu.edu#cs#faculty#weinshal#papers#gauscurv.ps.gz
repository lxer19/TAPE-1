Abstract: Structure from motion often refers to the computation of 3D structure from a matched sequence of images. However, a (relative) depth map of a surface may not be a good representation for storage and recognition; a more concise representation seems necessary. The sign of the Gaussian curvature of a surface is one candidate to be a part of a useful representation of the surface. I will show that in order to compute the sign of the Gaussian curvature it is not necessary first to go through the computationally expensive and error sensitive process of recovering the exact function of the surface and the motion parameters. I will first show that the sign of the normal curvature in a given direction at a given point in the image can be computed from a simple difference of slopes of line-segments in one image. Using this result, local surface patches can be classified as convex, concave, parabolic (cylindrical), hyperbolic (saddle point) or planar. At the same time the translational component of the optical flow is obtained, from which the focus of expansion can be computed. In addition, the axes of principal curvature and the axes of zero curvature are obtained.

Reference-contexts: The first is correspondence: matching features in the two images to find the appropriate disparity in position for each object or feature. This may be a difficult computation for many image pairs. In stereo in particular it is considered the heart of the computational problem (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). Henceforth I will assume that matching is given. The second step is the determination of the motion (or camera) parameters that can be used to compute the distance to objects in space using geometrical transformation. This is, in general, a very difficult computation.

Reference-contexts: For example, for the computation of a complete 3D structure from motion the motion parameters should be known. Structure from motion results often deal mainly with the minimal number of points that are necessary to compute the inverse transformation (see <ref> [2] </ref>). For this purpose it has been shown that 7 or 8 matched points in two views ([3] and [4]) or 5 points and their velocities in one view ([5]) are sufficient. The actual algorithms, however, are typically computationally expensive and sensitive to noise.

Reference-contexts: The actual algorithms, however, are typically computationally expensive and sensitive to noise. It is hard to guarantee a sufficiently good estimation of the motion parameters to maintain small errors in the structure computation (see <ref> [6] </ref>). General motion can be decomposed into a rotation around some axis followed by a translation. In a similar way the optical flow vector can be decomposed into two components: one due to the translation component of the motion and one due to the rotation component.

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that if we can identify the two components of the flow field then the problem is almost solved, the direction of motion and relative depth of all points can be computed from the translational component of the motion (see <ref> [7] </ref>). Because of the practical difficulties in devising a robust algorithm that will find a complete solution of the problem, the need for a more qualitative approach to motion analysis and to vision in general has been expressed (e.g., [8], [9] and [10]).

Note the emergence of the parabolic line on the torus (the line separating the hyperbolic region from the convex region, whose type is parabolic). It is often argued that these parabolic lines are important for image representation (see <ref> [17] </ref>). short version in IEEE Trans. on Pattern Anal.

Reference-contexts: Thus for surfaces where the asymptotes are locally straight lines on the surface, the number of straight lines on the surface that cross a point will determine the type of the surface. Various cues like intensity gradients (see <ref> [18] </ref>) can be used to determine whether a straight line in the image originated from a straight line on the surface (and thus of zero-curvature). Motion and stereo disparities help determine the sign of the curvature in between the zero-curvature directions which is necessary for surface classification (see section 3).

Reference-contexts: Let P = z (x; y; 1) in the new coordinate system. Let (R l ; # l ) and (R r ; # r ) be the projections in polar coordinates of P on the left and right images respectively (see figure 10). Then the following holds (see <ref> [19] </ref>): x = tan cot # r cot # l 2 sin Now the "first" image in the previous section will be one of the two actual images and the "second" image will be the perspective projection in the coordinate system defined above.

Reference-contexts: From Proposition 1 we see that the operator that gives the sign of the normal curvature has to check whether three points are collinear or otherwise how the angle between them is oriented. This is an example of a hyperacuity task (see <ref> [20] </ref> pp. 337 for a review), namely, the precision with which it can be done is ten times higher than the visual acuity. Thus, the biological system may be capable of computing the sign of the curvature directly, without recourse to an operator similar to .

Reference-contexts: These results are derived using vector field analysis and therefore assume the existence of a differentiable vector field (though singularities are addressed in <ref> [21] </ref>). The results are less general in that the curvature is assumed to be large relative to the distance to the object, and the angular part of the rotation is assumed small. It is also not clear how the appropriate vector field invariants can be computed.
