Abstract: Partitioning K Clones: Hardness Results Abstract Given a set of m molecules, derived from K homologous clones, we wish to partition these molecules into K populations, each giving rise to distinct ordered restriction maps, thus providing simple means for studying biological variations. With the emergence of single molecule methods, such as optical mapping, that can create individual ordered restriction maps reliably and with high throughput, it becomes interesting to study the related algorithmic problems. In particular, we provide a complete computational complexity analysis of the "K-populations" problem as well as some simple polynomial heuristics, while exposing the relations among various error sources that the optical mapping approach may need to cope with. We believe that these results will be of interest to computational biologists in devising better algorithms, to biochemists in understanding the tradeoffs among the error sources and finally, to biologists in creating reliable protocols for population study. and Practical Algorithms for the K -Populations Problem

Reference-contexts: To prove the inapproximability of this special case of the K-populations (KP) problem 3 , we use the recent technique of giving a gap-preserving reduction of a Max SNP-hard problem, the Max-cut (MC) problem, to our problem <ref> [AL97] </ref>. The proof has three steps. In step 1 we show the reduction of an instance of the MC problem to an instance of a bipartite Max-cut problem, with weights on the edges as 1 or 1 (BMC).

This is somewhat simplified by the fact that we include only those terms that model the false positive and false molecules, etc.
