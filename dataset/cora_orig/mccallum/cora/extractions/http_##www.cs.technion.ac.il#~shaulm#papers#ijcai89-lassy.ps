Abstract: This paper highlights a phenomenon that causes deductively learned knowledge to be harmful when used for problem solving. The problem occurs when deductive problem solvers encounter a failure branch of the search tree. The backtracking mechanism of such problem solvers will force the program to traverse the whole subtree thus visiting many nodes twice - once by using the deductively learned rule and once by using the rules that generated the learned rule in the first place. We suggest an approach called utilization filtering to solve that problem. Learners that use this approach submit to the problem solver a filter function together with the knowledge that was acquired. The function decides for each problem whether to use the learned knowledge and what part of it to use. We have tested the idea in the context of a lemma learning system, where the filter uses the probability of a subgoal failing to decide whether to turn lemma usage off. Experiments show an improvement of performance by a factor of 3. This paper is concerned with a particular type of harmful redundancy that occurs in deductive problem solvers that employ backtracking in their search procedure, and use deductively learned knowledge to accelerate the search. The problem is that in failure branches of the search tree, the backtracking mechanism of the problem solver forces exploration of the whole subtree. Thus, the search procedure will visit many states twice - once by using the deductively learned rule, and once by using the search path that produced the rule in the first place.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the search procedure will visit many states twice - once by using the deductively learned rule, and once by using the search path that produced the rule in the first place. One existing approach to avoiding harmful knowledge is not to acquire it at the first place <ref> (e.g. Minton 1988) </ref>. The learner tries to estimate whether a newly learned knowledge element is potentially harmful, and rejects it if it is estimated as such. Such an approach is termed selective learning.
