Abstract: There are many points in your career at which you will be called upon to present a paper in Theoretical Computer Science, perhaps a paper written by somebody else in a seminar or advanced Graduate-level course, or your own paper in an invited departmental colloquium or job interview, or at a conference. This skill is particularly important if you intend to pursue a career in academia. The author does not claim to be an expert in oral presentation, but has attended (and given) enough bad talks to be able to draw up a few rules of thumb. These are specific to the oral presentation of papers in Theoretical Computer Science, but some can be adapted to written presentations, and to a lessening extent to oral presentations of papers in other sub-disciplines within Computer Science, other scientific disciplines, and technical results of any nature. Different styles of presentation work for different people. These guidelines are intended to assist you in developing a workable style of your own. The remainder of this note is divided into four sections. The first, "What to Say and How to Say It", concentrates on choosing and organizing the material to be presented. The second, "Getting Through to the Audience", focusses on presentation. The third, "Visual and Aural Aids", discusses the proper use of overhead projector transparencies and the microphone. The fourth, "Question Time", is devoted to the period after the talk during which the audience asks questions of the speaker. An earlier version of this note has appeared in [2, 3].

Reference-contexts: Make sure that the text is large enough to be read from a distance. Normal-sized handwriting and 12-point type are unacceptable. Use standard document preparation software to produce large-type copy; the author uses SliT E X (see Lamport <ref> [1, Appendix A] </ref>), which automatically produces text in a large, easy-to-read font. This can be printed directly onto transparencies using a laser-printer, or the hardcopy can be photocopied onto the transparencies.
