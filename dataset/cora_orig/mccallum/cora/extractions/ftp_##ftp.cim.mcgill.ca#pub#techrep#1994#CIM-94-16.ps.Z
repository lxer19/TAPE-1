Reference-contexts: The result is the belief distribution found in Figure 2c. One can see that the system has a significantly higher degree of confidence in the hypothesis that the measured model was a large sphere. 3. Determining Which Viewpoints are Informative In <ref> [3] </ref>, it has been shown that recognition based on complete information produced perfect results in all cases. Since complete information is not always available, and potentially expensive to acquire, recognition schemes based on single viewpoints are required. We will show that recognition based on one view is not always reliable. <p> Characterizing Informative Viewpoints by External Threshold. It has already been shown that the system can successfully recognize an instance of any object in the database with perfect results, provided that all its surfaces are accessible, independently of viewpoint and sampling order <ref> [3] </ref>. It has also been shown that recognition from single-views retains most of the selectivity of the previous case, displaying high discriminatory powers, with the occasional false-positive cases.

Reference-contexts: Using this method of representation, rather than base conclusions on maximum likelihood methods from independent viewpoints, methods that combine evidence from single viewpoints would consider all models whose beliefs are above a threshold to be equally significant. In accordance with Marr's "Principle of Least Commitment" <ref> [18] </ref>, all possible hypotheses, rather than just one are communicated to the external processes. By normalizing our confidence values in this manner, combining them from different viewpoints becomes straightforward. At any point, one can histogram the binarized beliefs accumulated thus far.

Reference-contexts: As a result a method may work well only in specific cases and because of the hidden implicit nature of the conditioning assumptions, cannot be easily modified to work elsewhere. For this reason we have adopted the very general inverse problem theory of Tarantola <ref> [24] </ref>. In it the sources of knowledge used to obtain inverse solutions are made explicit, so if conditioning is required, the necessary assumptions about that knowledge are apparent and can be examined to see if they are realistic. <p> The logical operation of conjunction is appropriate, i.e. the solution to the inverse problem is given by the theory and the measurements and any a priori information about the models. Tarantola extends the notion of logical conjunction to define the conjunction of two states of information <ref> [24, pages 29-31] </ref>. <p> Accordingly, (1) is more general that the equations obtained through traditional approaches, but degenerates to them in specific cases. Under the conditions mentioned, the solution is identical to the Bayesian solution <ref> [24, page 61] </ref> where the a posteriori information about the model parameters is given by the marginal 2. The Inverse Problem Theory 7 probability density function: (m) = M (m) D D (d) 2.2. The Part Recognition Problem. <p> Our approach was based on a generalized inverse theory <ref> [24] </ref> using a probabilistic framework where assertions are represented by conditional probability density functions (belief distributions). The importance of the method is that it provides a formal recipe for representing and combining all prior knowledge in order to obtain these distributions.

Reference-contexts: In principal it should be possible for the task to condition or actively acquire the a priori knowledge required to make the solution acceptable.

The theory postulates that our knowledge about a set of parameters is described by a probability density function over the parameter space. <p> Information Obtained from Measurements. Much of the knowledge we have about a problem comes in the form of experimental measurements. In our system <ref> [28] </ref>, we obtain an estimate of the observed model parameters d obs , and also an estimate of their uncertainty in the covariance operator C d . <p> We have also demonstrated that some viewpoints can give rise to ambiguous information, where the system has confidence in more than one hypothesis. Similar to the motivation behind autonomous exploration in the model-building phase <ref> [28] </ref>, ambiguous views have spawned the development of an incremental recognition scheme, where we seek information from a new viewpoint to reduce the overall ambiguity. We have shown how evidence, in the form of the belief distributions, can be accumulated from a sequence of views.
