Title: Reducing Power Consumption for the Next Generation of PDAs: It's in the Network Interface!  
Author: Paul Gauthier, Daishi Harada, and Mark Stemm 
Date: January 2, 1996  
Abstract: The current trends in the computer industryseem to indicate that low-cost, light-weight personal digital assistants (PDAs) will emerge as a major player in the information access and mobile computing markets. An important issue which must be addressed for PDAs, however, is battery longevity. In this paper we examine this issue from the point of view of the possible policies employed by the PDA in controlling the sleep/active states of its network interface (NI) in order to most efficiently utilize its power resources without unduly compromising the timeliness of its user's ability to access information. In particular, we measured the power usage of two PDAs, the Apple Newton Messagepad and Sony Magic Link, and three NIs, the Metricom Ricochet Wireless Modem, and the AT&T Wavelan operating at 915 MHz and 2.4 GHz. These measurements clearly indicate that the power drained by the network interface consititutes a large fraction of the total power used by the PDA. Based on these measurements we also conducted simulation experiments showing that even using fairly naive policies it is possible to achieve considerable power savings; these simulation experiments used real user data of what we consider will be the killer apps of this market, electronic mail and web browsing. From this we found that although the specific balance of the tradeoffs were highly dependent on the particular application, the crucial factor seems to be the amount of time that the network interface is needlessly in an active but idle state.

A simple strategy, similar to those employed to manage the power of disk drives and LCD screens on laptops <ref> [2] </ref>, was modeled against the traces described above. Whenever the network interface has been idle for some fixed period of time, it switches into a low power sleep state.

Reference-contexts: Douglis et al also focus on reducing power consumption of disk drives, comparing the approach of spinning down after a fixed number of seconds with an optimal off-line algorithm that minimizes latency and maximizes power savings, showing that the off-line algorithm performs approximately 37% better than the fixed policy <ref> [4] </ref>. Other approaches to reducing disk power have been suggested, such as using a smaller (and therefore less power-hungry) disk as a cache for frequently used data, and eliminating the disk entirely and replacing it with flash memory [5], [6].
