Abstract: We describe a novel approach to topological mapping for mobile robotics, and its advantages over existing proposals. The central idea is to develop a hierarchical "multiple resolution" representation from the robot's perceptions of its environment, computing only at a relevant level of detail for a given navigation task. The robot may then perform the task of efficiently navigating to a specified location. The resulting system is efficient since computation occurs only over the simplest representations necessary for each stage of the navigation. "Zooming" to a higher resolution of representation is map-driven, and the different resolutions are achieved by a uniform method using very small artificial neural networks of 4 nodes. Thus, as well as allowing efficient navigation, the robot's development of its map also uses few computational resources.

Reference-contexts: 1 Motivation In concert with the topological mapping community in mobile robotics (eg: <ref> [KB93, DFH93] </ref>), we believe that a strategy for mapping a robot's environment should not, in the first instance, rely on information about odometry. Such dead reckoning navigation systems rely on proprioception (perception of internal states), and are subject to incorrigible errors due to wheel slippage. <p> More efficient journeys can be made if more detailed topology is only computed around target locations. Some theoretical results on topological mapping (eg: <ref> [DFH93] </ref>) fail to meet the last criterion, by relying on information that is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain from a real robot (for example the assumption that there is an enumeration of all path directions leading from each location). However, the results presented below are obtained from experimental data.

Reference-contexts: Various proposals also exist with regard to the use of self-organising feature maps (SOFM) <ref> [Koh90] </ref> in mapping strategies. Typically, sonar and infrared readings are fed into (computationally costly) high-dimensional (e.g. 10x10) SOFMs in order to develop a single representation of the environment. In contrast, our approach uses just three linear 4 by 1 SOFMs to map feature space at three levels of detail. <p> We now focus on our particular approach. Self-organising feature maps (SOFM) <ref> [Koh90] </ref> have previously been used for mapping strategies (e.g. [NS91, Kur96]): sonar and infrared readings were fed into high-dimensional (e.g. 10x10) SOFM's, requiring a constant high level of computation.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our approach uses just three linear 4 by 1 SOFMs to map feature space at three levels of detail. Tree-structured feature mappings are employed by <ref> [KO90] </ref> (although they are not maps in our sense), and are known to facilitate search algorithms of low computational complexity. 1 Of course, it is well understood that topological maps are more efficient than metric ones. 2 The "Efficient Delivery" Task The particular task that we have specified is that the

Reference-contexts: Use of data from a real robot. 1.1 Related work As far as we are aware, no other multiple-resolution approach to topological mapping exists. However, "hierarchical" representations of space have been proposed before, although in a quite different sense to that which we suggest. For instance Kuipers <ref> [Kui78] </ref> advocates the use of a hierarchy of spatial representations, moving from topological to geometrical information, but this hierarchy consists of different classes of representation, rather than of different levels of resolution within the same representation scheme.
