Abstract: Downward translation of equality refers to cases where a collapse of some pair of complexity classes would induce a collapse of some other pair of complexity classes that (a priori) one expects are smaller. Recently, the first downward translation of equality was obtained that applied to the polynomial hierarchy|in particular, to bounded access to its levels [HHH97a]. In this paper, we provide a much broader downward translation that subsumes not only that downward translation but also that translation's elegant enhancement by Buhrman and Fortnow [BF96]. Our work also sheds light on previous research on the structure of refined polynomial hierarchies [Sel95, Sel94].
