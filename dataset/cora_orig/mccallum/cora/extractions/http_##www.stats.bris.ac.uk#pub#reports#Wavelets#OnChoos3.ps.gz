Abstract: In curve estimation using wavelet methods it is common to select the resolution level to be an integer, so as to exploit the computational advantages of the pyramid or cascade algorithm. This choice, however, can produce a noticeable amount of either oversmoothing or undersmoothing. Its analogue for estimation by kernel methods is to restrict the bandwidth to be an integer power of 1 2 , which would seldom be acceptable. In this note we quantify the advantages of non-integer

Reference-contexts: In particular, this meant that the wavelets used enjoyed r = 6, and that d = 2. The optimal smoothing parameter p opt = h 1 opt was calculated by minimising this mean squared error approximation using the FMIN procedure from the netlib GO package <ref> (Brent, 1973) </ref>. The value of mean integrated squared error computed at the optimal smoothing parameter was taken as the numerical approximation, M 0 , to M 0 .

Reference-contexts: However, cross-validation and bootstrap methods are relatively attractive there, the latter having important similarities to their counterparts in kernel-based nonparametric regression <ref> (e.g. Faraway and Jhun 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Mean integrated squared error, rather than pointwise mean squared error, was taken as the measure of risk, and was evaluated by averaging 500 simulated density estimators calculated at 1000 grid points spread evenly over their finite support. All wavelet computations were conducted using WaveThresh Version 3 <ref> (Nason, 1995) </ref>. In particular, this meant that the wavelets used enjoyed r = 6, and that d = 2. The optimal smoothing parameter p opt = h 1 opt was calculated by minimising this mean squared error approximation using the FMIN procedure from the netlib GO package (Brent, 1973).
