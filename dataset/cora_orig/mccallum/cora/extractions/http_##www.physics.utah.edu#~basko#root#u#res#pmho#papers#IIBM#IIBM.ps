Abstract: In this paper we study duality properties of the M(atrix) theory compactified on a circle. We present evidence for the equivalence of this theory to the strong coupling limit of type IIB string theory compactified on a circle. In the M(atrix) theory context, our evidence for this duality consists of showing the appearance (upon compactification) of a topological term recently discovered in the D-string action, identifying the BPS states of IIB strings in the spectrum and finding the remnant symmetry of SL(2; Z) and the associated t moduli. By this IIB /M duality, a number of insights are gained into the physics of longitudinal membranes in the infinite momentum frame.

Reference-contexts: This is in agreement with the use of R 11 in M (atrix) theory as a cutoff, so that longitudinal branes are allowed to wind it only once! In addition, this is exactly what has been conjectured by Schwarz in his discussions on II B /M duality <ref> [1] </ref>, namely that in M theory the membrane wrapped on a torus should select a preferred cycle in which it is wrapped many times, and this preferred direction must be the one defined by the II B theory Kaluza-Klein excitations, which is nothing but the R 1 direction! This can be

Reference-contexts: appear to represent five corners of the moduli space for vacuua of the one and same theory, which yet in another corner of the moduli space is most conveniently viewed as a theory in eleven dimensions, dubbed M theory. (For recent reviews see, e.g., [1]-[6].) Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind <ref> [7] </ref> have proposed a definition of M theory in the infinite momentum frame (IMF) as a large N limit of maximally supersymmetric quantum mechanics of N fi N matrices describing D0-branes. This proposal has passed a number of consistency tests [7],[8]-[21]. <p> The usual II B /M duality [22, 23] asserts that M theory compactified on a torus is dual to the type II B string theory compactified on a circle. One way to test this is to compactify the M (atrix) theory on a transverse torus <ref> [7] </ref>. But in this paper we are going to compactify the M (atrix) theory on a transverse circle and to exploit the fact that in the IMF formulation of the M (atrix) theory, the longitudinal eleventh direction has to be compactified as an infrared regularization. <p> II A /M Duality and Uncompactified M (atrix) Theory The BFSS action for M theory in the IMF is a large N limit of the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics obtained by dimensionally reducing the supersymmetric U (N ) Yang-Mills action from 9 + 1 dimensions to 0 + 1 dimension <ref> [7] </ref>: S = g dt tr 2 1 [A i ; A j ][A i ; A j ] i (fl 0 r 0 + fl i [A i ; ]) ; (16) where i; j = 1; 2; ; 9 and r 0 = @ t + [A 0 ; <p> Guided by the II A /M duality, the BFSS formulation of M (atrix) theory <ref> [7] </ref> just postulates that in the limit both R 11 and N=R 11 going to infinity, the Hamiltonian (18) describes the uncompactified M theory in the IMF. <p> To test the II B /M duality we revisited in last section, normally one would consider compactification of M (atrix) theory on a transverse torus <ref> [7, 34, 9, 10, 19] </ref>, which needs to examine a (2 + 1)-dimensional quantum gauge theory. <p> expects to gain interesting insights into physics in the IMF formulation from this study, because it will involve longitudinal membranes that wrap around R 11 . 3.2 M (atrix) Theory Compactified on an Oblique Circle Now let us consider the M (atrix) theory compactified on a circle, which is normally <ref> [7, 34, 10] </ref> taken to be in a direction, say X 1 , perpendicular to the longitudinal X 11 , with radius R 1 . <p> First recall the usual case with S 1 in the X 1 -direction. By gauging a discrete subgroup of U (N) representing periodic translations in X 1 , the action for D0-branes in the compactified space can be written as an action for D1-branes on the dual circle 7 <ref> [7, 34, 10] </ref>. <p> It is instructive to compare the above identification of the spectrum for a longitudi nal membrane with that for a transverse membrane <ref> [7] </ref>. The configuration in M (atrix) 2 We thank M. <p> Here we would like to concentrate on the insights we have gained into the IMF description of M (atrix) theory for the behavior of a longitudinal membrane. No one has succeeded in constructing a longitudinal membrane, in the way a transverse membrane is constructed <ref> [7] </ref>, and no one doubts the existence of a longitudinal membrane in M (atrix) theory. From our study we have seen indeed the longitudinal membranes are hiding in the theory. <p> Banks and N. Seiberg, hep-th/9702187, appears which, among other things, has some overlapp with part of what we address here. A Modular Parameter and Compactification on Torus The general idea of compactification of M (atrix) theory on a compact manifold <ref> [7, 34, 10] </ref> is to consider the compact manifold as the quotient of a covering space over a discrete group.
