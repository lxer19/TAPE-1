Abstract: The goal of this research is to determine whether declared strategy voting can be an effective tool for group decision-making. Declared strategy voting is a novel group decision-making procedure in which preference is specified using voting strategies first-order mathematical functions that specify a choice in terms of zero or more parameters. This research will focus on refining the declared strategy voting concept, developing an accessible implementation of declared strategy voting that can be used for mock elections, assessing the potential impacts of declared strategy voting, and evaluating the effectiveness of declared strategy voting for group decision-making. This proposal describes the significance of this research, preliminary studies, and proposed methodology for the remainder of this project.

Reference-contexts: Gardenfors [17] analyzed voting schemes that do not necessarily select a single winner and showed that those which 4 Lorrie Faith Cranor are not manipulable or dictatorial are also very undecisive. Barbera <ref> [1] </ref> showed that strategic manipulation can, in fact, be avoided in decisive voting schemes if the voting procedure relies heavily on chance. However, he dismissed such procedures as inherently unattractive. Others have focused on analyzing the results of strategic manipulation and determining optimal strategies for voters to employ.

Reference-contexts: Such information could be misleading, faulty, or even contrived to misrepresent the truth. Even when the best known polling techniques are used, it is currently impossible to ensure that people respond truthfully rather than provide strategic responses that misrepresent their true preferences. Strategic voting is a valid democratic alternative <ref> [22] </ref> that can be augmented through the use of a declared strategy voting system. Thus, a declared strategy voting system might mitigate the effects of pre-election polls and exit polls. Impact on the types of conclusions that can be drawn from election results.

Assume that as ballots are counted, the percentage of votes for each alternative versus the number of votes already counted is graphed. <p> Merrill conducted simulations of several voting systems using both types of models and found that Condorcet efficiency and utility efficiency did not change much between the two models as long as candidate and voter dispersion were kept the same in the spatial model <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there appears to be little research that seeks to facilitate the use of voting strategies in a large-scale election. One recent paper by Myerson and Weber <ref> [26] </ref> could be viewed as an effort to facilitate strategic voting. <p> They proved that if pre-election surveys are repeated continuously, an equilibrium will eventually be reached in which the voters' perceptions are consistent with the survey or election outcome. They also demonstrated that the equilibria vary according to the voting system used. The Myerson and Weber <ref> [26] </ref> equilibria come about after voters become aware of each others' preferences through multiple rounds of surveys. I plan to investigate whether similar equilibria can be induced in a single round using declared strategy voting. Declared Strategy Voting 5 2.3.

Reference-contexts: Political scientists often use the term strategic voting to describe insincere or manipulative behavior on the part of voters in the context of a traditional election. Gibbard [18] and Satterthwaite <ref> [35] </ref> independently investigated the strategic manipulation of elections with three or more alternatives and proved that strategic manipulation can occur under all voting schemes that are not dictatorial and select a single alternative as the winner.

Reference-contexts: The design of Sensus grew from my survey of traditional and (proposed) electronic polling systems. I reviewed several different sets of ideal election system characteristics found in the literature <ref> [2, 15, 29, 34, 36] </ref> and developed a set of four distinct core properties that are likely to be desirable in almost any election system: Accuracy. A system is accurate if it is not possible for a vote to be altered or eliminated from the final tally without detection. <p> However most of these solutions are impractical to implement or do not satisfy all the criteria. A few cryptographic solutions look feasible to implement with some minor modifications <ref> [15, 29, 36] </ref>. <p> If somebody signs the outside of the envelope, they also sign the document inside. The signature remains attached to the document, even when it is removed from the envelope. Chaum [9] and Schneier <ref> [36] </ref> provide more backgroundinformation on public key cryptography, digital signatures, and blind signatures. Declared Strategy Voting 9 vote. The voter than sends the tallier the ballot decryption key. The tallier uses the key to decrypt the vote and add it to the tally.

Reference-contexts: Declared Strategy Voting Simulator I have designed and implemented a simulation of declared strategy and traditional elections that collects statistics about declared strategy voting. This modular Perl <ref> [37] </ref> computer program allows for the generation of simulated voter populations, generation of a voting strategy for each voter based on a set of rules, evaluation of strategies, and collection of statistics about the election. The simulator can collect statistics about a simulated election using several metrics: Condorcet efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The alternative with the highest mean utility is the utility maximizer. The utility efficiency is the ratio between the mean utility of the first-place alternative and the mean utility of the utility maximizer. This metric was introduced by Weber <ref> [38] </ref> and has been used to compare traditional election systems. 3.3. Initial Simulation The initial simulation was designed to explore the effects of several types of strategies on elections in which the order of strategy evaluation is determined randomly.

Reference-contexts: Despite the complicated nature of this voting procedure, voters rejected proposed constitutional amendments to replace it with a plurality system in 1959 and 1968 <ref> [16, 39] </ref>. The single transferable vote system of proportional representation has proven controversial when adopted by American cities. Adopted by over 20 cities in the first half of the twentieth century, single transferable vote is currently used only by Cambridge, Massachusetts. <p> There are a variety of variations on this procedure with different methods for calculating the quota needed for election, different redistribution procedures, and different methods for resolving ties <ref> [20, 33, 39] </ref>. 5 Approval voting, independently developed by at least five sets of people in the mid 1970s, allows voters to vote for (approve of) as many of the candidates as they wish.
