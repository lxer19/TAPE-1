Reference-contexts: One of them generalizes a construction from [4] where by definition a morphism i of C is an inclusion if and only if U (i) is an inclusion of D. The two conditions have been used in <ref> [3] </ref> where the first author has proved that they are sufficient for U to reflect limits and colimits, respectively. Since in the practical cases U is a forgetful functor from complicated structures to simpler ones, one can find weak inclusion systems for the complicated structures. <p> Since I is I-right cancellable it follows that U (f ) 2 I, that is f 2 I C . 2 3.1 Final Morphisms In the following we define the notion of U -final morphism. This definition generalizes a concept within topological spaces and it was taken over from <ref> [3] </ref>. Definition 17 A morphism f : A ! B of C is U -final (see [3]) if for each morphism h : U (B) ! U (C) of D such that U (f ); h is the image by U of a morphism in C (A; C), there exists h <p> This definition generalizes a concept within topological spaces and it was taken over from <ref> [3] </ref>. Definition 17 A morphism f : A ! B of C is U -final (see [3]) if for each morphism h : U (B) ! U (C) of D such that U (f ); h is the image by U of a morphism in C (A; C), there exists h 0 : B ! C in C with U (h 0 ) = h. 2 Theorem <p> Remark that if f above belongs to E I C then f = e f by the uniqueness of factorisation, therefore f is U -final and U (f ) 2 E I . 2 3.2 Initial Morphisms The concept of U -initial morphism <ref> [3] </ref> is the dual of the notion of U -final morphism. We remind the reader the definition. Definition 19 A morphism f : A ! B of C is U -initial (see [3]) if for each morphism h : U (C) ! U (A) of D such that h; U (f <p> and U (f ) 2 E I . 2 3.2 Initial Morphisms The concept of U -initial morphism <ref> [3] </ref> is the dual of the notion of U -final morphism. We remind the reader the definition. Definition 19 A morphism f : A ! B of C is U -initial (see [3]) if for each morphism h : U (C) ! U (A) of D such that h; U (f ) is the image by U of a morphism in C (C; B), there exists h 0 : C ! A in C with U (h 0 ) = h. 2 Theorem <p> An application f : (T; ) ! (T 0 ; 0 ) is a morphism in Top if it is a continuous application, i.e. for any D 0 2 0 it follows that f 1 (D 0 ) 2 . The following proposition appears in <ref> [3] </ref> and we omit its proof. Proposition 21 The morphism f : (T; ) ! (T 0 ; 0 ) is a U -final morphism if and only if for each D 0 T 0 , D 0 2 0 iff f 1 (D 0 ) 2 .

Reference-contexts: The weak inclusion systems represent an analogy to the factorisation systems (e.g. see [6]), which have been used many places in computing science (e.g. see [5, 12, 13], and also the older papers [10, 11]). 1 The inclusion systems were first introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> as a categorical tool to study modularisation. In some cases, including modularisation, they are more useful than the factorisation systems. Excepting the introduction, our paper is structured in four sections. The first section is about definitions and basic properties of weak inclusion systems. <p> The intuition for inclusion systems is that they give for each morphism a unique object of factorisation, rather than merely up to isomorphism like in the case of the factorisation systems. In this paper we prefer to use a weaker framework than that from <ref> [4] </ref> and we prove some old results about factorisa-tion systems and we obtain some new results. The same idea appears in [7], where the research goes in another direction. <p> The same idea appears in [7], where the research goes in another direction. We mention that the category of many-sorted algebras, which is very much used in theoretical computing (especially in semantics), does not admit an inclusion system in the the style of <ref> [4] </ref> but it admits a weak inclusion system. <p> We give two conditions and prove that each is sufficient to build a weak inclusion system for C. One of them generalizes a construction from <ref> [4] </ref> where by definition a morphism i of C is an inclusion if and only if U (i) is an inclusion of D. The two conditions have been used in [3] where the first author has proved that they are sufficient for U to reflect limits and colimits, respectively. <p> The last section of the paper investigate pushout and pullback properties of the weak inclusion systems. They may be useful in many categorical approaches to computing, especially to modularisation.

Definition 2 hI; Ei is a weak inclusion system for a category C if I and E are two subcategories of C with jIj = jE j = jCj such that 1. <p> If we had required that E should contain only epimorphisms and I admit finite coproducts (denoted by "+"), we would have obtained inclusion systems <ref> [4] </ref> or abstract inclusion systems [7]. <p> Now it is obvious that h 1 = h 2 (i is a monic). 2 The following corollary appears in <ref> [4] </ref> as a particular case of the proposi tion above for inclusion systems. 16 Corollary 26 Let C be a weak inclusive category which has pullbacks. Let i A : A ,! C and i B : B ,! C be two inclusions.

Reference-contexts: Our main goal is to give both definitions and properties in the most general form, allowing the computing scientist to apply them in his (or her) fields of interests as a technical device. The weak inclusion systems represent an analogy to the factorisation systems (e.g. see <ref> [6] </ref>), which have been used many places in computing science (e.g. see [5, 12, 13], and also the older papers [10, 11]). 1 The inclusion systems were first introduced in [4] as a categorical tool to study modularisation. <p> They may be useful in many categorical approaches to computing, especially to modularisation.

Reference-contexts: Based on this remark, we give an equivalent definition for weak inclusion systems (see Definition 10) based only on the subcategory of inclusions. The second section refers to categorical subobjects in the clasical style (see <ref> [8] </ref>). The category of inclusions is an independent system of representatives for (categorical) subobjects, that is each subobject contains at most one inclusion. <p> They may be useful in many categorical approaches to computing, especially to modularisation.
