Abstract: We prove the first exponential lower bound on the size of any depth 3 arithmetic circuit with unbounded fanin computing an explicit function (the determinant) over an arbitrary finite field. This answers an open problem of [N91] and [NW95] for the case of finite fields. We intepret here arithmetic circuits in the algebra of polynomials over the given field. The proof method involves a new argument on the rank of linear functions, and a group symmetry on polynomials vanishing at certain nonsingular matrices, and could be of independent interest.

The basic idea in [G82] was to design a linear operator on polynomials into matrices which maps a product Q m L `;m into a matrix of a bounded rank.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we interpret the arithmetic circuits in the polynomial algebra over the given field. The determinant function is especially interesting because of its algebraic universality property ([V79]) over arbitrary fields. We refer a general reader to [L84] and <ref> [H77] </ref> for all the needed notions used in our proof. We denote by F = F q a finite field with q elements. We shall study fields for q 3 (for q = 2, the boolean case, the lower bound could be derived from [R87] and [V79]).

Reference-contexts: The representation (1) can be viewed as a depth 3 arithmetic circuit. In contrast to boolean circuits we interpret arithmetic circuits (1) as an identity in the polynomial algebra (vs. the algebra of functions over F , see section 1 below). Recently, Razborov <ref> [R98] </ref> was able to generalize our results to the algebra of functions over F . An important problem remains open to get lower bounds for representations of the kind (1), or for the more general bounded depth circuits, over the arbitrary fields including zero characteristic.
