Abstract: Part 1: Modelling and numerical results Abstract In the extrusion of polymeric melts at high flow rates, often flow instabilities observed as surface distortions of the extrudate occur. The flow instability 'spurt' in piston-driven flows is accompanied by persistent oscillations in the pressure. In this paper spurt is explained in terms of constitutive instabilities (mechanical failure of the polymeric fluid itself), while the no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the die is maintained. The influence of compression on the onset of spurt is investigated for an extrusion process that is modelled by the flow of a JSO-fluid through a contraction from a wide barrel into a narrow cylindrical capillary. Numerical computations disclose that persistent oscillations in the pressure as well as in the volumetric flow rate occur for a bounded range of prescribed plunger speeds. The onset of the persistent oscillations is found to depend on both the material parameters of the polymer and the dimensions of the barrel and the capillary. Numerical computations on loading and unloading processes, in which the plunger speed is gradually raised or lowered, clarify the influence of the deformation history.

Reference-contexts: Malkus et al. <ref> [3, Sec. 3] </ref> have shown by a phase-plane analysis of the critical points of the system (2.48), that the solution ! with ! M &lt; ! &lt; ! m corresponds to a saddle point. Hence, this !-solution is unstable and is therefore not attained. <p> This extra term accounts either for the response of a small-molecule solvent, or for the unhindered motion of the polymer chains, described by a very fast relaxation rate (cf. Malkus et al. <ref> [3] </ref>). The JSO-model used here 21 describes the characteristic behaviour of viscoelastic concentrated polymer solutions and pure molten polymers with fading memory, by a differential equation. <p> This nonmonotone relation gives rise to three distinct steady state solutions ! if F m &lt; F &lt; F M . As shown by Malkus et al. <ref> [3, Sec. 3] </ref> and by Aarts and Van de Ven [6], the solution ! with ! M &lt; ! &lt; ! m is unstable, whereas the solutions ! with ! &lt; ! M or ! &gt; ! m are stable.

Reference-contexts: In order to find a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon of persistent oscillations, as observed in experiments of Kalika and Denn [16], Lim and Schowalter [17], and El Kissi and Piau <ref> [4] </ref>, an extrusion flow combined with compression has been considered. The extruder consists of a wide cylindrical barrel connected to a narrow cylindrical capillary. The melt is compressed in the barrel by a plunger moving at constant speed V 0 . <p> Finally, we will present the critical conditions, in terms of the parameters " and O, for the onset of persistent oscillations predicted by our theory, and we will compare these to the critical conditions found in experiments (cf. <ref> [16, 17, 4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We observe that P increases while r fl remains fixed, when Q i increases from Q i = 0:2 up to Q i = 0:5. Hence, the boundary of the spurt layer remains fixed after loading, which is referred to as shape memory (cf.[3], or <ref> [6] </ref>). For Q i = 0:6, however, we observe that both r fl and P have become smaller. Hence, the boundary of the spurt layer has moved further away from the wall, and the shape memory is lost. <p> This nonmonotone relation gives rise to three distinct steady state solutions ! if F m &lt; F &lt; F M . As shown by Malkus et al. [3, Sec. 3] and by Aarts and Van de Ven <ref> [6] </ref>, the solution ! with ! M &lt; ! &lt; ! m is unstable, whereas the solutions ! with ! &lt; !
