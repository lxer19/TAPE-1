Abstract: Symmetry is treated as a continuous feature and a Continuous Measure of Distance from Symmetry in shapes is defined. The Symmetry Distance (SD) of a shape is defined to be the minimum mean squared distance required to move points of the original shape in order to obtain a symmetrical shape. This general definition of a symmetry measure enables a comparison of the "amount" of symmetry of different shapes and the "amount" of different symmetries of a single shape. This measure is applicable to any type of symmetry in any dimension. The Symmetry Distance gives rise to a method of reconstructing symmetry of occluded shapes. We extend the method to deal with symmetries of noisy and fuzzy data. Finally, we consider grayscale images as 3D shapes, and use the Symmetry Distance to find the orientation of symmetric objects from their images, and to find locally symmetric regions in images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the basic features of shapes and objects is symmetry.

Reference-contexts: Marola [27] presents a coefficient of mirror-symmetry with respect to a given axis. Global mirror-symmetry of an object (image) is found by roughly estimating the axis location and then fine tuning the location by minimizing the symmetry coefficient. Gilat [16], Hel-Or et.al.[18] and Avnir et.al. <ref> [5] </ref> present the idea of a Measure of Chirality (a measure of deviation from mirror-symmetry). Similar to Marola, Gilat's chirality measure is based on minimizing the volume difference between the object and it's reflection through a varying plane of reflection.

Reference-contexts: Perspective projection, inconsistent lighting, digitization and quantization do not usually preserve exact symmetry. Furthermore, existence of several objects in the scene requires a notion of local symmetries, while occluded symmetries and partial symmetries should also be dealt with. In an early work, Grunbaum <ref> [17] </ref> reviews methods of geometrically measuring symmetry of convex sets. Yodogawa [39] has presented an evaluation of symmetry (namely "Sym-metropy") in single patterns which uses information theory to evaluate the distribution of symmetries in a pattern. Marola [27] presents a coefficient of mirror-symmetry with respect to a given axis.

Reference-contexts: Once symmetry is considered a continuous feature, it becomes dependent on the resolution by which the scene is viewed. Figure 3 shows examples which are more symmetrical at low resolutions than at high resolutions. Julesz et. al. <ref> [22] </ref> showed that separation into frequency channels precedes symmetry detection, thus different symmetries can be seen simultaneously in an image. In general, however, the symmetries found at high resolution also exist at low resolution.

Reference-contexts: Thus the symmetry map displays the "amount" of mirror-symmetry at every point (with respect to the given reflection plane) where low grey values denote high symmetry content and high grey values denote low symmetry content (Figure 32c). 3.

Reference-contexts: Symmetrical descriptions of shapes [9, 11, 15, 21] or detection of symmetrical features of objects [34] can be useful in guiding shape matching, model-based object matching and object recognition [31, 33]. Reconstruction of 3D objects has also been implemented using symmetry as a constraint <ref> [36, 14, 29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Local circular (radial) symmetries have been detected and located in images [6, 34]. Mirror and linear symmetries have been detected in images of single objects (global symmetry) and extended to local symmetries [7, 27]. Additional work on skewed symmetry detection was presented <ref> [37, 31] </ref>. So far, symmetry has been treated as a binary feature: either it exists or it does not exist. However, even when objects in the world are symmetrical, their projection onto a digital image is not necessarily so.

Reference-contexts: However, the exact mathematical definition of symmetry <ref> [28, 38] </ref> is inadequate to describe and quantify the symmetries found in the natural world nor those found in the visual world (a classic example is that of faces see Figure 1). <p> For further details and an excellent review see <ref> [38] </ref>. An n-dimensional object has mirror-symmetry if it is invariant under a reflection about a hyperplane of dimension (n 1) passing through the center of mass of the object.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, existence of several objects in the scene requires a notion of local symmetries, while occluded symmetries and partial symmetries should also be dealt with. In an early work, Grunbaum [17] reviews methods of geometrically measuring symmetry of convex sets. Yodogawa <ref> [39] </ref> has presented an evaluation of symmetry (namely "Sym-metropy") in single patterns which uses information theory to evaluate the distribution of symmetries in a pattern. Marola [27] presents a coefficient of mirror-symmetry with respect to a given axis.

Reference-contexts: Select that orientation which minimizes the Symmetry Distance value. As previously noted, this minimization is analytic in 2D (derivation is given in Appendix A.3) but requires an iterative minimization process in 3D (except for the 3D mirror-symmetry group where a closed form solution has been derived see <ref> [40] </ref>). scribed above with respect to mirror-symmetry, for the shapes shown in Figure 2. 9 shapes of Figure 2 as a function of the percentage of arm shortening.

Reference-contexts: The first stage locates symmetry focals those points about which the image is locally symmetric. Several methods can be used to find the symmetry focals (see [33, 34]). We used a variant of the multiresolution method presented in <ref> [41] </ref> for sampling and transmitting an image, which uses a simple model of the human visual attention mechanism. We used the Quad Tree [35] structure which is a hierarchical representation of an image, based on recursive subdivisions of the image array into quadrants as is shown in Figure 30.

Reference-contexts: In higher dimensions, however, no analytic solution was found and a minimization procedure is used (except for the mirror symmetry group in 3D where a closed form solution is given see <ref> [42] </ref>). A.4 Dividing Points of a Shape into sets As described in Section 3, when measuring C n -symmetry (rotational symmetry of order n) of a shape represented by a multiple of n points, the points must be divided into sets of n points.

Reference-contexts: The normalization presents an upper bound of on the mean squared distance moved by points of the shape. Thus the SD value is limited in range, where SD=0 for perfectly symmetric shapes (see Appendix in <ref> [43] </ref>). <p> The folding method for the cases where the number of points is not a multiple of the number of elements in G is not derived here. Details of this case can be found in <ref> [43] </ref>. 30 A.3 Finding the Optimal Orientation in 2D Following the derivation in Appendix A.2 we derive here an analytic solution for finding the rotation matrix R which minimizes Equation 4, i.e. finding the orientation of the reflection axes of the G-symmetry group.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [44] </ref> (Appendix A.2) we gave the derivation for the specific case of the mirror-symmetry group (D 1 ) having the two elements: fE; g. <p> Additionally we replace R i the rotation matrix with R = sin 2 cos 2 the reflection about an axis at an angle to the x-axis. The angle is found analyticaly (see <ref> [44] </ref>) thus the dimensionality of the problem is 2q + 1 (rather than 2q + 2) and elimination of the last row and column of matrix U (see Section 6.1) allows an inverse solution as in the rotational symmetry case.
