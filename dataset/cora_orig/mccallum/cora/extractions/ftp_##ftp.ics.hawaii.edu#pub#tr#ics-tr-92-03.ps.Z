Title: Supporting Scientific Learning and Research Review Using COREVIEW  
Author: Dadong Wan and Philip Johnson

Abstract: Scientific learning and research are becoming increasingly computerized. More and more such activities are mediated through electronic artifacts. This paper presents an artifact-based system called COREVIEW, to be used in the domain of research seminars. The emphasis of our approach is on the centrality of textualized artifacts in seminar activities, the relationship between different types of artifacts, and the dynamic interactions among them over time. Our system provides explicit representation of research artifacts and their structures, and support for the process of collaborative artifact generation, integration, manipulation and utilization.

Reference-contexts: The exploratory support of COREVIEW is based on the EGRET framework [Johnson, 1992]. The potential of computer-mediated environments in facilitating collaborative learning have long been recognized and widely researched by both educators and researchers <ref> [Hiltz, 1988; Butler, In Progress] </ref>. However, most of these studies look only at loosely structured, asynchronous messaging [Butler, In Progress] and computer conferencing systems [Hiltz, 1988]. <p> The potential of computer-mediated environments in facilitating collaborative learning have long been recognized and widely researched by both educators and researchers [Hiltz, 1988; Butler, In Progress].

Reference-contexts: Writing a good literature review paper, for instance, involves more than just rehashing existing artifacts; it also needs a uniform framework that helps bring together and make sense of related artifacts. * Argumentative. Unlike rhetoric models (e.g., IBIS <ref> [Conklin, 1988] </ref>) that use generic entities such as issue or position, RESRA supports argumentation using entities and relations that characterize the structure of research artifacts. <p> The development of RESRA is inspired by positive results from studies on the use of concept maps to enhance science learning [Cliburn, Jr., 1990].

Reference-contexts: One potential application of COREVIEW outside of research seminars is to support the peer refereeing and reviewing process of scientific journals <ref> [Lipetz, 1991] </ref>. At the implementation level, we are planning to extend COREVIEW to support Internet worldwide bulletin board system, wide area information network (WAIS), multimedia, and so forth, and to transport it to other platforms.
