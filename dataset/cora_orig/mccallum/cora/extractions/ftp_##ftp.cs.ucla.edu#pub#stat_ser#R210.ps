Reference-contexts: to estimating the causal effect of smoking would be to seek a variable z such as "cigarette price" or "smoking advertisement" which is exogenous to the smoking ! cancer linkage, then use the IV-ratio (Eq. (3)) to estimate the strength of the linkage. (For non-parametric bounds on this structure, see <ref> [Balke & Pearl, 1993] </ref>). The MV-approach would be to seek an endogenous variable, like the amount of tar deposits in a person's lung, which is believed to mediate the linkage smoking ! cancer.

Reference-contexts: The IV-estimator is highly biased if a slight correlation exists between Z and U <ref> [Bartels, 1991] </ref> and, since U is unobservable, there is no effective test to reveal such correlation. Undesired correlations between Z and U can emanate from two sources; unspecified factors influencing both Z and Y , and direct influence of Z on Y .

Reference-contexts: Under such conditions we can multiply Eq. (1) by Z, take the expectation and obtain an expression for b: b = r yz =r xz (3) This ratio and its various matrix manifestations came to be known as the Instrumental-Variable (IV) estimator <ref> [Bowden & Turkington, 1984] </ref>. In spite of its general appeal and wide use, the method of instrumental variables suffers from two major drawbacks. 1 1. The method does not extend naturally to non-linear models.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we are in the possession of a general non-parametric estimator for the causal effect of a potential cause X on a potential response 4 In <ref> [Pearl, 1993] </ref> I have used the notation P (yjset (X = x)) which evoked objections from a number of traditionalists. The lack of mathematical notation for representing interventions is and will continue to be a glaring deficiency in the statistical literature. <p> This allows us to write Eq. (20) as P fl (yjx) = z which is aesthetically more appealing. However, the similarity to standard probabilistic formulas should be approached with caution, since the conditioning operator in P fl obeys a different set of syntactic rules than ordinary conditioning <ref> [Pearl, 1993] </ref>. We summarize this result by a theorem, following a formal definition of the assumptions.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In an effort to avert confounding in observational studies, economists and social scientists have devised a method called "instrumental variables" <ref> [Reiersol, 1945] </ref> which is based on the following basic principle. Assume we are interested in estimating the influence of X on Y as given by the structural equation: Y = bX + U (1) where U represents unobserved (zero-mean) disturbances.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, we must assume that cigarette smoking has no other effect on cancer production except the one mediated through tar deposits (3 0 ). These assumptions are represented in the causal network of Figure 2 (adopted from <ref> [Spirtes, et al, 1993] </ref>, page 231). It is identical to the path diagram of Figure 1, but does not show the disturbances and parameters explicitly. In this diagram, as well as in the rest of the paper we have removed the notational distinction between Z and Z 0 . <p> the degree to which cigarette smoking increases (or decreases) lung cancer risk, we will assume a hypothetical study in which the following factors were measured simultaneously on a large, randomly selected sample from the population. 1. amount of smoking (X) 2 For an excellent historical account of this debate, see <ref> [Spirtes, et al, 1993, pp. 291-302] </ref>. 5 2. amount of tar deposits in the lungs (Z) 3. whether lung cancer has been found (Y ) To simplify the exposition and to demonstrate the application of the method to non-linear models, we will further assume that all three variables are binary, taking

Reference-contexts: The structure of the MV formula (10) can be interpreted as a peculiar form of two-steps regression, quite unlike the methods of "two-stage least-square" estimation <ref> [Theil, 1954] </ref>. In the first stage, a regression of the mediating variable Z 0 on the explanatory variable X produces the coefficient r z 0 x and the fitted values Z 0 = r z 0 x X.

Reference-contexts: Undesired correlations between Z and U can emanate from two sources; unspecified factors influencing both Z and Y , and direct influence of Z on Y . Although procedures were developed for minimizing the possibility of selecting inadequate instruments <ref> [Wu, 1973] </ref> these procedures are only partially successful as they rely on comparisons to other estimators and are uniformative in case of disagreements. All in all, the selection of reliable instrumental variable must be based on subjective judgment about cause-effect relationships in the domain.
