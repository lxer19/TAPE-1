Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general class of quorum systems called Crumbling Walls and study its properties. The elements (processors) of a wall are logically arranged in rows of varying widths. A quorum in a wall is the union of one full row and a representative from every row below the full row. This class considerably generalizes a number of known quorum system constructions. The best crumbling wall is the CWlog quorum system. It has small quorums, of size O(lg n), and structural simplicity. The CWlog has optimal availability and optimal load among systems with such small quorum size. It manifests its high quality for all universe sizes, so it is a good choice not only for systems with thousands or millions of processors but also for systems with as few as 3 or 5 processors. Moreover, our analysis shows that the availability will increase and the load will decrease at the optimal rates as the system increases in size.

Reference-contexts: In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced. Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries are proved. Alternative protocols based on quorum systems (rather than on voting) appear in [22] (using finite projective planes), <ref> [1] </ref> (the Tree system), [6, 20] (using a grid), [18, 19, 33, 32] (hierarchical systems). The triangular system is due to [21, 10]. A generalization of the triangular system appears in [27] under the name Lovasz coteries. The Wheel system appears in [23]. <p> The constructions of [25] have both optimal load and high availability, however the availability becomes high only for large values of n. Additionally, all the existing constructions have quorum sizes larger than p n (except for the Tree construction of <ref> [1] </ref>). 2 1.3 New Results This paper introduces a new class of quorum system constructions, which we call Crumbling Walls (or simply walls). <p> The Lovasz coteries of [27] are a generalization of the Triang, in which the first row contains a single element, and all the other rows contain at least 2 element each. A quorum in the system is defined as in the Triang. In the Tree system <ref> [1] </ref> the elements are organized in a complete rooted binary tree. A quorum in the system is defined recursively to be either (i) the union of the root and a quorum in one of the two subtrees, or (ii) the union of two quorums, one in each subtree. <p> Hence, the following definition of 5 [28]. Definition 2.7 [28] A parameterized family of functions g p (n) : N ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for p 2 [0; 1], is said to be Condorcet if lim n!1 ( 2 , 2 , 2 for all n. <p> Hence, the following definition of 5 [28]. Definition 2.7 [28] A parameterized family of functions g p (n) : N ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for p 2 [0; 1], is said to be Condorcet if lim n!1 ( 2 , 2 , 2 for all n. <p> In other words, a strategy gives the probability that a quorum S j will be picked. Definition 2.8 Let a quorum system S = (S 1 ; : : : ; S m ) be given over a universe U . Then w 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> m is a strategy for S if it is a probability distribution over the quorums S j 2 S, i.e., P m For every element i 2 U , a strategy w of picking quorums induces a probability that the element i is accessed, which we call the load <p> Proposition 2.10 [25] L (S) 1 c (S) for any quorum system S. Proposition 2.11 [25] F p (S) p c (S) for any quorum system S and any p 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> In particular, this means that CWlog is asymptotically superior to the FPP [22] and the Grid [6], both of which have failure probabilities tending to 1 (see [19, 32]). The CWlog has asymptotic availability similar to that of the Tree system of <ref> [1] </ref> (as analyzed in [28]). The CWlog has worse asymptotic availability than the constructions of [18, 19, 25] and than the Maj system [36], which has the optimal availability [5].

Reference-contexts: Thus PickBalanced is appropriate in systems with broadcast communication capabilities in which the current configuration is available to the processors (e.g., the Transis system <ref> [2] </ref>), or in point-to-point systems in which the configuration changes are infrequent, where we can assume that the configuration is known for long periods of time.

Reference-contexts: Note that this model implicitly assumes that the communication links are perfect, and that the network is fully connected, hence the network never partitions. In general this is an oversimplification of real communication networks (see <ref> [3] </ref> for an empirical evaluation of network connectivity). However we believe that such a model is reasonable for some important cases, and especially for a well maintained local area network (LAN). Notation: We use q = 1 p to denote the probability of an element survival.

Of these, roughly 2 n 2 are voting coteries ([11, 16] and the references therein). The following proposition shows that the number of ND walls is exponential in n (in fact, it is exactly a Fibonacci number).

Reference-contexts: Next we introduce what we consider to be the best crumbling wall, the CWlog system, with quorums of size lg nlg lg n. 1 We show that it has optimal load among the quorum systems with logarithmic size quorums, namely L (CWlog) = O (1= log n). In <ref> [30] </ref> it is shown that CWlog also has optimal availability among quorum systems in that class, namely F p (CWlog) = O (n " ) for some constant "(p) &gt; 0. <p> The elements need to be logically arranged in rows of widths n i , and then a procedure is needed to produce a quorum on demand. In the sequel we suggest two alternative procedures to pick a quorum, with slightly different properties. 4.2 The Availability of CWlog In <ref> [30] </ref> we analyze the asymptotic failure probability of general crumbling walls, and show that CWlog is essentially the only high-availability wall. As a part of this analysis we obtain the following theorem, which describes the asymptotic behavior of F p (CWlog). Theorem 4.1 [30] Consider the CWlog system on d rows, <p> properties. 4.2 The Availability of CWlog In <ref> [30] </ref> we analyze the asymptotic failure probability of general crumbling walls, and show that CWlog is essentially the only high-availability wall. As a part of this analysis we obtain the following theorem, which describes the asymptotic behavior of F p (CWlog). Theorem 4.1 [30] Consider the CWlog system on d rows, with n i = blg 2ic, let q = 1 p, and let ff be such that ff + lg (1=ff) = 2 (ff 0:3099). <p> For example, if we consider only q 0:7 and take r = 1:429, then a = 8 is valid. 5 Conclusion In the previous sections and in <ref> [30] </ref> we have analyzed the availability and load of general crumbling walls. We have also identified what we consider to be the best system within this class of quorum systems, the CWlog system, and analyzed it in detail.
