Abstract: We consider assembling specialized, customized textbooks from a large collection of SGML documents. Our prototype assembly framework allows the user to select parts of the documents in the collection and to form a new structured document. The order of a user is processed in the following way. (1) The user tlls in and submits an HTML form. (2) The form is processed and the parts to be included in the assembled book are selected automatically. The choice is dependent both on the user's input and a few heuristic rules. (3) The texts and images are retrieved from the pool and the layout is created. (4) The books are printed and delivered to the client. In addition, we describe our experience on converting MS Word documents into tagged SGML format by presenting both the conversion architecture and lessons learned.
