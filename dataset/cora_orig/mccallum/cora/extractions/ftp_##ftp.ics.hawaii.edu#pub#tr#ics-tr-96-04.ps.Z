Title: Requiem for the Project HI-TIME Collaborative Process

Abstract: In early 1995, the State of Hawaii began work on an ambitious revision to its telecommunications policy planning process. A multidisciplinary team was commissioned to develop a proposal for an iterative, interactive, computer-mediated collaborative planning process whereby the State's telecommunications infrastructure plan could be developed and periodically upgraded to reflect technology and policy shifts in local communities. The proposal included a sophisticated, CSCW software system called HI-TIME which would both enact the planning process as well as provide access and visibility into the planning process for the general public. In early 1996, the ambitious collaborative planning process, including the implemented, deployed HI-TIME system, was abandoned in favor of a more traditional approach. This paper explores the rise and fall of Project HI-TIME and the lessons it holds for developers of CSCW systems.

Reference-contexts: A more cost effective approach is to recognize the need for an on-going planning process and to develop mechanisms, both automated and organizational, for supporting that process. In May 1993, responding to legislative mandate, the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii, instituted PUC docket 7702 <ref> [1] </ref>, a proceeding on telecommunications infrastructure for the State of Hawaii. In conducting these proceedings, the PUC elected to convene a series of facilitated collaborative sessions involving all registered intervenors and participants in the docket.

Reference-contexts: By June of 1994, the "Communications Infrastructure Collaborative" issued its final report to the PUC detailing a framework for introducing competition in the Hawaii telecommunications market and for accelerating the deployment of a "world-class" infrastructure <ref> [2] </ref>. The report was the foundation for landmark legislation in the 1995 Hawaii legislature which moved Hawaii to the forefront in innovative telecommunications regulatory policy [5].

Reference-contexts: Lack of widespread and informed public input to telecommunications infrastructure planning has made it more difficult to resolve such critical issues as <ref> [3] </ref>: * the definition of universal service, * how to deal with information have-nots, * which government services should be freely provided via the infrastructure, * equal access for rural and disadvantaged communities, and * low-cost access for educational, health and community ser vice organizations.

Reference-contexts: TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY PLANNING The Hawaii Telecommunications Infrastructure Modernization and Expansion (HI-TIME) project sought to establish a Strategic Planning Process for the State of Hawaii that can serve as a model for Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure planning throughout the nation <ref> [4] </ref>. The primary goal was to provide the government of the State of Hawaii with public policy principles, strategic objectives, and a plan of recommended actions to guide decision making.

Reference-contexts: The report was the foundation for landmark legislation in the 1995 Hawaii legislature which moved Hawaii to the forefront in innovative telecommunications regulatory policy <ref> [5] </ref>. The success of the Communications Infrastructure Collaborative led the State Administration to believe that telecommunications planning was an area of public discourse that would greatly benefit from improved mechanisms for collaboration.
