Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The control of multimedia conferencing, covering, among others, the distribution of state information, floor control, voting, membership, have been discussed in a number of papers; a range of proposals have been implemented, ranging from highly structured traditional multimedia systems such as MMC and JVTOS <ref> [1] </ref> to loosely coupled systems such as the Internet multicast tools (MBONE tools). Except for the MBONE [2, 3] tools, most of the existing conferencing systems are monolithic: They either consist of a single program or a tightly integrated suite of programs that can only interoperate within the set.

Reference-contexts: Other explicit mechanisms include invitation by active mail; WWW and X.500 have also been used as directories. This architecture has been described in more detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. While the MBONE conference controllers allow the combination of different media agents, these controllers are of the fire-and-forget variety. The conference controller simply starts the media agent processes, passing parameters such as multicast address, port number or media encoding as command line arguments.

Reference-contexts: Rather than bloating already complicated media agents (even assuming that access to source code or a cooperative author exists), these tasks are often ideally suited for implementation by users or local administrators as small scripts in an interpreted language, such as Tcl <ref> [8] </ref>. The Tcl tool command language and the Unix shell share some of the same philosophy. While Tcl uses the send command to implement a type of one-to-one remote procedure call, the Unix shell uses pipes to connect a linear sequence of independent tools. <p> However, the architecture does not depend on the use of RTP/RTCP. 3 Message Format All messages are sent as ASCII text and are interpretable by, for example, a Tcl <ref> [8] </ref> interpreter 1 . Parameters containing spaces are enclosed in braces. A binary encoding, using numeric constants instead of text constants and type-length fields instead of space-separated words, could be used, for a slight gain in processing efficiency and a loss of debugging capability.

Reference-contexts: However, for a single user, at most one application is currently responsible for each media session within a conference, as explained in Section 3.1. The idea of subscribing to events is also found in <ref> [10] </ref>, albeit for mediating access to shared hypermedia objects within a single system. A file-system event registration service called file-activity monitor (FAM) is offered within the Silicon Graphics Irix operating system. Mark Handley's and Ian Wakeman's work on 3 naming components is also reflected in the message formats [11].

This approach could also be considered as a status-based system, as used for control networks [12]. The architecture is receiver-oriented, with a similar behavior as found in IP multicast: the sender does not know or care who receives its messages, rather, receivers express interest in particular kinds of messages.

Reference-contexts: However, instead of a rigid set of IP multicast addresses, the receiver-directed filter allows a dynamic and fine-grained control over which messages reach a receiver. Receiver-directed filters are also central to the RSVP resource reservation protocol <ref> [13] </ref>. The system presented here uses constants and information provided by the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [14] and the audio/video profile of that protocol [15].

The second and third media parameters denote the number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo) and the sampling rate. The final media parameter is the packetization interval. For video, only the media sub-command would differ.

Reference-contexts: Slashes were chosen as a hierarchy indicator to align with URL usage <ref> [16] </ref> and since they are not used within domain names. An URL-like escape mechanism permits the use of other characters. A typical conference name would be the name advertised by the session directory tool sd.

Reference-contexts: For multicast, a single class-D address is provided: C ! M : 17/audio/3 open 224.2.0.1 The multicast address needs to be selected to avoid collisions, e.g., with Van Jacobson's sd session directory or algorithms like <ref> [17] </ref>. For unicast or one-to-many protocols like ST-II with explicit target lists, a list of target host names (or dotted-quad IP addresses) is used instead: C ! M : 17/audio/3 open ursa.fokus.gmd.de 192.35.149.140 This operation is also used to add additional hosts to an on-going unicast connection.
