Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 317 Appears in: IEEE Data Compression Conference, Snowbird, Utah, March 1995. Abstract We present a fully automatic system for 2D model-based image coding of human faces for potential applications such as video telephony, database image compression, and face recognition. The system operates by locating a face in the input image, normalizing its scale and geometry and representing it in terms of a parametric image model obtained with a Karhunen-Loeve basis. This leads to a compact representation of the face that can be used for both recognition as well as image compression. Good-quality facial images are automatically generated using approximately 100-bytes worth of encoded data. The system has been successfully tested on a database of nearly 2000 facial photographs.

Reference-contexts: Over the years, various strategies for facial feature detection have been proposed, ranging from the early work of Kanade with edge-map projections <ref> [1] </ref>, to more recent techniques using generalized symmetry operators [6] and multilayer perceptrons [9]. In our face processing system this task is critically important since after face detection, the scale-normalized face must then be geometrically normalized by aligning it with a canonical geometrical model.

Reference-contexts: This detection strategy is equivalent to matching with eigentemplates and allows for a greater range of distortions in the input signal (including lighting, rotation and scale). In a statistical signal detection framework, the use of eigentemplates has been shown to yield superior performance in comparison with standard matched filtering <ref> [2] </ref>. Pentland et al. [5] used this same formulation for eigenspace representation of facial features (e.g., eyes, noses and mouths). In this domain, the equivalent "distance-from-feature-space" (DFFS) can be effectively used for the detection of visual features.

Reference-contexts: Portions of the face processing system described in this paper were originally developed as part of a face recognition system <ref> [3] </ref>. The interface to the recognition system consists of a browsing tool called Photobook which allows the user to interactively search through the database based on facial similarity. The user begins by selecting the types of faces he/she wishes to examine; e.g., adult Caucasian males. <p> This modularity in face description has distinct advantages for face coding in low-bit rate video teleconferencing. This detection system was recently tested on the ARPA FERET face database where over two thousand facial photographs were processed with 97% reliability <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 System Description The block diagram of our face processing and coding system is shown in Figure 4. The first stage is a multiscale search for a face. After the position and scale have been identified the image is warped (scaled) to center the face at a standard scale.

Reference-contexts: This scheme was later extended by Turk & Pentland [8] and others <ref> [4] </ref> to the problem of automatic face recognition. Welsh & Shah [10] also demonstrated a low-bit rate compression scheme for transmission of facial features such as lips, using a KL expansion.

Reference-contexts: Our system is computationally simple and is able to locate a face in an input scene despite changes in head scale, slight head tilts (&lt; 15 ffi ), moderate lighting variations and variable image contrast. This detection technique is based on eigentemplates <ref> [5] </ref> and is a generalization of the standard matched filter formulation and uses the KL expansion of a set of training faces. <p> Note that the first four images (in the top row) are all of the same person (taken a month apart and exhibiting different hairstyles, clothing, scale, etc.). Previously, the face recognition system has achieved a 95% recognition accuracy on the Media Lab database of 7,562 facial images <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 KL Expansions for Facial Image Coding The use of the KL expansion for characterization of human faces was first suggested by Sirovich & Kirby [7]. This scheme was later extended by Turk & Pentland [8] and others [4] to the problem of automatic face recognition. <p> Welsh & Shah [10] also demonstrated a low-bit rate compression scheme for transmission of facial features such as lips, using a KL expansion. Most of these systems (with the exception of [8] and later <ref> [5] </ref>) did not address the problem of detection, and used manual registration of images for demonstrating the concept. For a KL compression scheme to be useful in real-life coding applications, the face must first be detected and normalized prior to the computation of the expansion coefficients. <p> In a statistical signal detection framework, the use of eigentemplates has been shown to yield superior performance in comparison with standard matched filtering [2]. Pentland et al. <ref> [5] </ref> used this same formulation for eigenspace representation of facial features (e.g., eyes, noses and mouths). In this domain, the equivalent "distance-from-feature-space" (DFFS) can be effectively used for the detection of visual features. Given an input image, a distance map is constructed by computing the DFFS at each pixel. <p> The performance of the eigentemplate technique was recently tested on a database of approximately 8,000 "mugshot" photographs, where it achieved a 94% detec tion rate showing an order of magnitude improvement over standard template matching <ref> [5] </ref>. Our system conducts a parallel search for the eyes, nose and mouth using separate sets of eigentemplates for each feature.

The residual error in a KL expansion (referred to as the "distance-from-face-space" in the context of "eigenfaces" <ref> [8] </ref>) is a an effective indicator of a match. The residual error is easily computed using the projection coefficients and original signal energy. This detection strategy is equivalent to matching with eigentemplates and allows for a greater range of distortions in the input signal (including lighting, rotation and scale).
