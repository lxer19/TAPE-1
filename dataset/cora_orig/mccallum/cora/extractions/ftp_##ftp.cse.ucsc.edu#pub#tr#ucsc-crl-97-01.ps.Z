Abstract: The key to the method of measured equation of invariance (MEI) is the postulate: "the MEI is invariant to the excitation". In this paper, we proved that the MEI is independent of the excitation with the error bounded by O(h 2 ), where h is the discretization step. We also proved that the consistent condition jjL M=h 2 jj = ", where L is the partial differential operator, and M the equivalent MEI operator. If the MEI coefficients C fl i (i = 1; : : : ; 4) are determined from the special distribution named metrons on the boundary of the object, then " = ffiJ(s), otherwise " = J(s), where J (s) is a functional of the source distribution s, and ffiJ (s) is the perturbation of the functional J (s). And finally we pointed out that the error between the accurate solution and the solution of MEI is bounded by two terms, one is caused by the FD approximation at interior nodes which is proportional to h 2 , another is caused by MEI and is independent of h but proportional to ffiJ (s) which ensured the accuracy

Reference-contexts: And the consistent condition for MEI has been shown in theorem 2. It is straightforward to get the conclusion jj 0 jj ~ 1 jjffiJjj + ~ 2 h 2 (32) according to maximum principle <ref> [Smi85, BL84] </ref>. This theorem states that the accuracy of the solution of MEI does not increase with the decreasing of step size h, however, if metrons are chosen properly on the surface of object, the MEI still ensures the accuracy of the solutions. According to Lax theorem [Smi85, BL84], which essentially <p> to maximum principle <ref> [Smi85, BL84] </ref>. This theorem states that the accuracy of the solution of MEI does not increase with the decreasing of step size h, however, if metrons are chosen properly on the surface of object, the MEI still ensures the accuracy of the solutions. According to Lax theorem [Smi85, BL84], which essentially states the convergence property is equivalent to stability property given that the consistent condition is satisfied. Therefore, this theorem somehow described the convergence property of MEI. Fig. 7 shows the relative error of potential distribution between accurate solution and MEI solutions with different step sizes.

Reference-contexts: For this situation, the MEI coefficients will be obtained by a least square procedure. As discussed in <ref> [HML94] </ref>, piecewise functions are also a good choice of metrons for most problems, especially for three dimensional problems where continuous functions are hard to be defined. We also use the previous example to demonstrate this theorem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Measured Equation of Invariance (MEI) is a new concept in computational electromag-netics <ref> [MPCL92] </ref>. MEI is used to derive the local finite difference (FD) like equation at mesh boundary where the conventional FD/FEM approach fails. <p> Therefore, the final system matrix encountered by MEI is a sparse matrix with size similar to that of integral equation methods, which results in dramatic savings in computing time and memory usage compared to other known methods. It has been successfully used to analyze electromagnetic scattering problems <ref> [MPCL92, HLM94, HM94, CHZ96, CHed] </ref>, and microwave integrated circuits [PPM93a, PPM93b]. MEI concept has also been applied to IC interconnect parasitic extraction [HSD96] [SHD96], which is becoming more and more important with the increase of clock rate and decrease of feature size. <p> On the truncated boundary nodes as shown in Fig.1, a different type of relation has to be applied, such as traditional E.W., M.W., and ABC's. Mei <ref> [MPCL92] </ref> postulated the existence of the following linear equation for the truncated boundary nodes 3 X c i (r i ) = 0 (2) 2 3.
