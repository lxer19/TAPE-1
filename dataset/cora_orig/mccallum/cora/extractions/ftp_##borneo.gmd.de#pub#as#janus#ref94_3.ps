Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Blackboard architectures tend to be used in task domains where the problems are typically complex and require diverse sources of expertise in order to be solved. There are many such systems in use, particularly in the domain of theoretical knowledge-based systems (see <ref> [1] </ref> for an overview of current applications). The systems tend to vary widely in their actual implementations, although the philosophy of the blackboard method remains the same.

Reference-contexts: The data may also be time-stamped in order to allow reasoning about temporal events. This is shown schematically in Figure 1. We copy this general architecture in a hierarchical manner in building the JANUS <ref> [2, 3] </ref> control system. The need for flexibility in problem solving and control motivated the blackboard model originally.
