Reference-contexts: The -5V and -2V ECL voltages are applied to the card on P2 from a power adaptor card which plugs onto the other side of the backplane. This card is discussed in the TEM specification <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.1 Block Diagram of PGM sections of the card: the VME Slave Interface, the VME Bus Interrupter/Status Logic, the Reset/Configuration Logic, the Pattern Generation State Machine, the Interrupt Branch 1 Input Logic, and finally the Reject Counter/Interval Timer Logic. <p> It does this through the decoding of VME read/write transfers into individual read/write strobes, and through the distribution of those strobes and local address and data busses throughout the card. Like the TEM <ref> [1] </ref>, the slave is implemented for standard A24:D16 VME bus operation. The VME Bus Interrupter/Status Logic section contains the status register for the card and the logic to generate a VME bus interrupt. <p> The Reject Counter/Interval Timer Logic section contains two 16-bit event counters and a timer. The purpose of this logic is to provide a correction to the "dead time" calculations made by the Event Counters on the TEM <ref> [1] </ref>, in the special case where a PGM Trigger Interrupt is blocked by the state machine. The two independent event counters tally the number of Trigger A and Trigger B Interrupts which are rejected by the TEM. <p> All connections on this link use differential 10K ECL logic levels. When the TEM is used standalone (with no PGM) and with an external clock, that clock is applied directly to the appropriate pins on the TEM Clock and Control Input connector <ref> [1] </ref>. When the TEM is used with a PGM and also with an external clock, that clock is applied to the PGM Input connector, passed through the PGM without being referenced, and sent to the TEM on the link described above. <p> As such, the PGM adheres to the same Trigger Control bit definitions as specified for the TEM <ref> [1] </ref>. These defintions are shown in Table 1. However, unlike the TEM, with the exception of the Bunch Crossing 0 bit, on the PGM the Trigger Control bits have no special individual functionality associated with them. <p> On this connector the PGM delivers the 8-bit Trigger Control output stream from its Pattern Memory to the TEM. Also on this connector, from the TEM, the PGM receives a copy of the TEM high-speed clock <ref> [1] </ref> which it uses as its own timebase. The PGM may also deliver the external timebase source to the TEM through this connector. The PGM Output Connector is mounted at the same position on the PGM as is the Clock and Control Input Connector on the PGM. PGM Input Connector.

Reference-contexts: The card acts as an A24:D16 slave. As such, it supports both D16, D08 (Even), and D08 (Odd) transfers. The appropriate transfer width for a bus cycle depends on the location being accessed within the card address space. The card supports Address-Only cycles <ref> [3] </ref>, but does not support block transfers. It does support read-modify-write cycles. 5.1.1 Address Modifier Support All I/O addressable space on the card is accessable in Standard Address Space, for Data Access. <p> If the OR network is still held high by the original interrupt source status bit, then any subsequent transitions by other bits will be impossible to detect. The interrupt logic uses the Release on Acknowledge (ROAK) method to deassert the interrupt request line <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> 11 is automatically deasserted by the PGM during the acknowledge cycle for that interrupt, even though the on-board request line to the interrupt logic is still asserted. 5.2.3 IRQ Level Support and Interrupt Source ID The PGM supports generating interrupt requests at any of the 7 VME bus priority levels <ref> [3] </ref>. The priority level used for interrupt request and acknowledge cycles is selected via jumpers on the card. The card has an 8-bit Interrupt ID register which provides the bus master (in this case the DAQ Processor) with an interrupt source identifier during the interrupt acknowledge cycle.
