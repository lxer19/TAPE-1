Abstract: We show that a function over a free algebra is definable in the simply typed -calculus (modulo the Bohm-Berarducci embedding) iff it is generated by predicative monotonic recurrence. By monotonic recurrence we mean iteration with parameters, and our predicativity condition uses the notion of tiers introduced in [Lei90]. In fact, we show that the same functions are generated by tiered monotonic recurrence whether 2 tiers, or all finite tiers, are used.
