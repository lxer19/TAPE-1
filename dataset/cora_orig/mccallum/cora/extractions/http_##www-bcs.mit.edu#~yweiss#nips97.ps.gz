Abstract: Estimating motion in scenes containing multiple moving objects remains a difficult problem in computer vision. A promising approach to this problem involves using mixture models, where the motion of each object is a component in the mixture. However, existing methods typically require specifying in advance the number of components in the mixture, i.e. the number of objects in the scene. Here we show that the number of objects can be estimated automatically in a maximum likelihood framework, given an assumption about the level of noise in the video sequence. We derive analytical results showing the number of models which maximize the likelihood for a given noise level in a given sequence. We illustrate these results on a real video sequence, showing how the phase transitions correspond to different perceptual organizations of the scene. In: M. I. Jordan, M. J. Kearns and S. S. Solla (ed) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 10 Figure 1a depicts a scene where motion estimation is difficult for many computer vision systems. A semi-transparent surface partially occludes a second surface, and the camera is translating horizontally. Figure 1b shows a slice through the horizontal component of the motion generated by the camera points that are closer to the camera move faster than those further away. In practice, the local motion information would be noisy as shown in figure 1c and this imposes conflicting demands on a motion analysis system reliable estimates require pooling together many measurements while avoiding mixing together measurements derived from the two different surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Most approaches involve some tradeoff parameter to balance the benefit of an additional component versus the added complexity <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we have shown how this tradeoff parameter can be implicitly specified by the assumed level of noise in the image sequence.

Reference-contexts: Although our notation does not make it explicit, R k (x; y) is a function of k through equations 1-2. As in most mixture estimation applications, equation 3 is not maximized directly, but rather an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to iteratively increase the likelihood <ref> [3] </ref>. 1.2 Maximum Likelihood not necessarily with maximum number of models It may seem that since K is fixed in the likelihood function (equation 3) there is no way that the number of surfaces can be found by maximizing the likelihood.

Reference-contexts: The two eigenvalues are proportional to 1 and E= 2 1. So the likelihood function has a local maximum at the origin if and only if E &lt; 2 . (see <ref> [6, 4, 8] </ref> for a similar analysis in other contexts). This result makes intuitive sense. Recall that 2 is the expected noise variance. Thus if the mean squared residual is less than 2 with a single surface, there is no need to add additional surfaces.

Reference-contexts: the scene first the tree is segmented from the background, then branches are split from the tree, and finally the background splits into the flower bed and the house. 3 Discussion Estimating the number of components in a Gaussian mixture is a well researched topic in statistics and data mining <ref> [7] </ref>. Most approaches involve some tradeoff parameter to balance the benefit of an additional component versus the added complexity [2]. Here we have shown how this tradeoff parameter can be implicitly specified by the assumed level of noise in the image sequence. <p> In current work we are exploring the use of weak priors on as well as comparing our method to those based on cross validation <ref> [7] </ref>. Our analytical and simulation results show that an assumption of the noise level in the sequence enables automatic determination of the number of moving objects using well understood maximum likelihood techniques. Furthermore, for a given scene, varying the assumed noise level gives rise to different perceptually meaningful segmentations.

Reference-contexts: The scene is modeled as composed of K surfaces with the velocity of each surface at location (x; y) given by (u k (x; y); v k (x; y). The velocity field is parameterized by a vector k . A typical choice <ref> [9] </ref> is the affine representation: u k (x; y) = k 1 x + k v k (x; y) = k 5 x + k The affine family of motions includes rotations, translations, scalings and shears. It corresponds to the 2D projection of a plane undergoing rigid motion in depth. <p> We now illustrate the phase transitions on a real video sequence. Figures 6- 8 show the output of an EM motion segmentation algorithm with four components on the MPEG flower garden sequence (cf. <ref> [9, 10] </ref>). The camera is translating in the scene, and objects move with different velocities due to parallax.
