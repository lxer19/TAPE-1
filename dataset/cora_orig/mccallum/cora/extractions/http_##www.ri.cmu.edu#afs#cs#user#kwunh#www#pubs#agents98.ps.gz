Abstract: Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain which involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. In this paper, we describe CMUnited, the team of small robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm, and developed and implemented algorithms for strategic collaboration between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots can organize themselves in formations, hold specific roles, and pursue their goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors on multiple occasions. The robots can also switch roles to maximize the overall performance of the team. We present an overview of the vision processing algorithm which successfully tracks multiple moving objects and predicts trajectories. The paper then focusses on the agent behaviors ranging from low-level individual behaviors to coordinated, strategic team behaviors. CMUnited won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition at IJCAI-97 in Nagoya, Japan.

Reference-contexts: We developed the physical robots as actuators, a vision processing algorithm to perceive the world, and strategic reasoning for individual and collaborative behaviors. The team is clearly not the ultimate version of our multiple autonomous agents. We have developed previous versions of the team <ref> [1] </ref>, and, as presented in the discussion and conclusion section, improving the team further is part of our on-going research.

Reference-contexts: Robotic soccer is an example of such complex tasks for which multiple agents need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. Robotic soccer offers a challenging research domain to investigate a large spectrum of issues of relevance to the development of complete autonomous agents <ref> [2, 8] </ref>. The fast-paced nature of the domain necessitates real-time sensing coupled with quick behaving and decision making.

Reference-contexts: This section focusses on presenting our vision processing algorithm whose accuracy makes it a major contribution towards the success of our team. 2.1 Detection The vision requirements for robotic soccer have been examined by different researchers. Small-sized and medium-sized robotic soccer researchers investigate on-board and off-board vision processors respectively <ref> [3, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. Due to the reactiveness of soccer robots both frameworks require a high perception processing cycle time. And, due to the rich visual input, dedicated processors or even DSPs have been used.

Reference-contexts: All of these skills must be executed while avoiding obstacles such as the walls and other robots. The navigational movement control is done via closed-loop reactive control. The control strategy follows a modified version of a simple Braitenburg vehicle <ref> [4] </ref>. The Braiten-burg love vehicle defines a reactive control mechanism that directs a differentially driven robot to a certain destination point (goal).

Reference-contexts: Current robot positions are matched with the closest positions from the previous frame, taking into account the size of the robots and an estimate of their velocity. The algorithm is robust to noisy detections, but in theory it is not guaranteed to find the optimal correct matches <ref> [5] </ref>. However in practice our detection and association approach is highly reliable. 2.3 Tracking and Prediction In the setting of a robot soccer game, the ability to detect merely the locations of objects on the field is often not enough. <p> The process then iteratively repeats, alternating between the update and the propagate steps. Through a careful adjustment of the filter parameters modelling the system, we were able to achieve successful tracking and, in particular prediction of the ball trajectory, even when sharp bounces occur <ref> [5] </ref>. Our vision processing approach worked perfectly during the RoboCup-97 games. We were able to detect and track 11 moving objects (5 teammates, 5 opponents and the ball). The prediction of the movement of the ball provided by the EKF is used by several agent behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Like for real soccer players, it is essential for robots to predict future locations of the ball (or even of the other players). We have used an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) for such a purpose <ref> [6] </ref>. The Kalman-Bucy filter is very suitable for such a purpose since the detection of the ball's location is noisy. The EKF is a recursive estimator for a possibly nonlinear system. The goal of the filter is to estimate the state of a system.

We have been doing research extensively in the simulator league, developing learning techniques and team strategies in simulation [14, 16]. Many of these team strategies were directly incorporated into the robotic system described here.
