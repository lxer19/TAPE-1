Abstract: SUMMARY The paper describes Bayesian analysis for agricultural field experiments, a topic that has received very little previous attention, despite a vast frequentist literature. Adoption of the Bayesian paradigm simplifies the interpretation of the results, especially in ranking and selection. Also, complex formulations can be analyzed with comparative ease, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A key ingredient in the approach is the need for spatial representations of the unobserved fertility patterns. This is discussed in detail. Problems caused by outliers and by jumps in fertility are tackled via hierarchical-t formulations that may find use in other contexts. The paper includes three analyses of variety trials for yield and one example involving binary data; none is entirely straightforward. Some comparisons with frequentist analyses are made. The datasets are available at http://www.stat.duke.edu/~higdon/trials/data.html.

Reference-contexts: In the computations, we use Hastings steps to accommodate the non-Gaussian likelihood. We note that morning glory plants are susceptible to competition through overtopping but this is not an issue at the spacing in this experiment. In other applications, competition might be addressed through an auto-logistic component <ref> (Besag, 1974) </ref> in which the interaction parameters for nearest neighbours are constrained to be non-positive. <p> Thus, we have adopted a four-neighbour Gaussian intrinsic autoregression as our baseline representation of two-dimensional variation in fertility. This particular choice involves two unknown parameters, controlling scale and lateral asymmetry, and has dual interpretations, both as a limiting version of a first-order stationary Gaussian (conditional) autoregression <ref> (Besag, 1974) </ref> and as locally-planar stochastic interpolation. Also, as the asymmetry parameter fi 2 (0; 1) tends to each of its extremal values, we obtain random walks along the rows or along the columns of the trial and these we employ for one-dimensional fertility adjustment.

Reference-contexts: In the Bayesian analysis, the fertility map shows little variation within columns. Finally, note that the geostatistical formulation does not allow for uncertainty in estimating the parameters in (6.1), though this could be corrected in a corresponding fully Bayesian analysis <ref> (Diggle et al., 1998) </ref>. 6.2 Combining information across trials Although it is of course possible to amalgamate the results of the individual analyses, it is natural in a Bayesian setting to adopt a hierachical variety prior, as described in Section 2.2, and hence produce a combined analysis.

Reference-contexts: In natural populations in the southeastern United States, the W locus is generally polymorphic, so that at least two of the pigment intensities are present, with the frequency of the white allele being typically less than 40% <ref> (Epperson and Clegg, 1988) </ref>. However, the combined effects of factors, such as pollinator behaviour, outcrossing rates and the contribution to the pollen pool, would seem to bestow an advantage on the white allele (Rausher and Fry, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Treatment replication, in some form, is essential in making this a realistic task. As a consequence of an entirely model-based approach to the analysis, we believe it is highly desirable to provide some robustness to aberrations in the form of possible outliers and jumps in fertility <ref> (Papadakis, 1984) </ref>. Gaussian models are especially vulnerable. Thus, a feature of our approach is that we propose formulations based on t-distributions, in which the degrees of freedom are guided by the data.

Reference-contexts: Some compromises must be made, as, for example, in ff-designs of Patterson and Williams (1976). In practice, severe restrictions can be imposed by expense, machinery, management practice, and shortage of land and possibly seed. Plots are usually long and narrow. Unfortunately, many experiments employ inappropriate designs <ref> (Preece, 1982) </ref>: thus, the El Batan trial in Figure 3.1 uses a randomized complete block design, despite involving 50 varieties of wheat.

Hence jW j, the product of the non-zero eigenvalues of W , is immediately available for any fi. We use Metropolis steps for the updates.

Reference-contexts: However, the combined effects of factors, such as pollinator behaviour, outcrossing rates and the contribution to the pollen pool, would seem to bestow an advantage on the white allele <ref> (Rausher and Fry, 1993) </ref>. In this experiment, which involved the planting of more than 3000 seedlings, it was hoped to detect the presence of other forces, which might explain the anomaly.
