Title: CBX 98 26  An Improved dE=dx Calibration for CLEO II/SVX

Abstract: This note outlines a procedure for calibrating dE=dx at the track level in CLEO II/SVX data. This calibration is designed to relate the measured values of pulseheight from the wire hits along the track (DE50) to the fundamental quantity specific ionization (I). While I is expected to be a function of fifl only it is observed that DE50 is dependent on other quantities. The value of I reconstructed using this technique does not show the same extraneous dependencies as DE50 and we observe 2.1 K= separation at 2.6 GeV/c. No reprocessing is required to use this calibration since the individual hit information is not used. Those wishing to use this calibration but uninterested in the details may want to proceed to Appendix D for instructions on how to apply it to CLEO II/SVX data.
