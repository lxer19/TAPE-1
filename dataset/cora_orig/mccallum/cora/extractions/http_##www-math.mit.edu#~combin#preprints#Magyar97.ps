Title: MULTIPLE FLAG VARIETIES OF FINITE TYPE  
Author: PETER MAGYAR, JERZY WEYMAN, AND ANDREI ZELEVINSKY 
Abstract: We classify all tuples of flag varieties with finitely many orbits under the diagonal action of the general linear group.

Reference-contexts: Our proof of Theorem 1.1 uses results and ideas from the theory of quiver representations. In fact, our classification is very close to the classification of all quiver representations of finite type due to V. Kac <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, the problem of classifying all such tuples for an arbitrary G is still open. (In a special case when k = 3, P 1 = B, and P 2 and P 3 are maximal parabolic subgroups, such a classification was given in <ref> [2] </ref>.) Here we present a complete solution of the classification problem for G = GL n . Let a = (a 0 ; : : : ; a p ) be a positive integer vector with the sum of components equal to n.
