Abstract: In this paper we discuss a unified approach to browsing personal messages, news, and reminders for both a wearable audio computing environment as well as a desktop visual display. A clock-like spatial layout of the data encodes its arrival time, to support recall and provide a coherent representation of the message space for both visual and auditory user interfaces. Other data attributes are translated into parallel auditory and visual representations, so as to facilitate user transitions and learning between the two display techniques. COHERENT VIEW FOR LOCAL AND NOMADIC ACCESS In an information rich environment, people wish to have seamless access to personal messaging and communication services both at their desktop, as well as on-demand while they are away from their offices. Augmented audio systems [1] can provide an awareness of timely information in a nomadic physical environment. We have developed a wearable computing platform, Nomadic Radio
