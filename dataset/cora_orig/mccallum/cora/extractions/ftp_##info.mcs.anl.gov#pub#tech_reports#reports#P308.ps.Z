Reference-contexts: Hence, Theorem 4.5 implies that if the sequence fx k g generated by the gradient projection method converges to x fl , then (4.7) holds. Closely related convergence results for the gradient projection method are due to Bert-sekas <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, Gafni and Bertsekas [12, 13], and Dunn [9]. However, in these papers it is not shown that (4.6) holds; instead, it is shown that any limit point of the sequence fx k g is stationary.

Reference-contexts: For recent work on the identification properties of optimization algorithms see, for example, Conn, Gould, and Toint [7]. Dunn [11], Wright [24], Burke <ref> [3] </ref>, Burke, More, and Toraldo [5], Lescrenier [17], Wright [25], and Kelley and Sachs [16]. In linearly constrained problems an identification result can also be expressed in terms of the indices of the active constraints. <p> For a general convex set , it is difficult to characterize the vectors d 2 N (F ) that expose a face F . On the other hand, the following result of Burke <ref> [3, Theorem 4.1] </ref> provides a complete characterization for polyhedral . 5 Theorem 2.4 Let be a polyhedral set in IR n . If x 2 , then x 2 ri fE (d)g if and only if d 2 ri fN (x)g. <p> If x 2 , then x 2 ri fE (d)g if and only if d 2 ri fN (x)g. If F 2 F, then F = E (d) if and only if d 2 ri fN (F )g. Burke <ref> [3] </ref> proved only the first claim in Theorem 2.4, but it is not difficult to show that both claims are equivalent. Theorem 2.4 fails if is a general convex set. <p> Moreover, if F = E (d) for d = (0; 1), then d exposes F , but d =2 ri fN (F )g. This example shows that the assumption of polyhedrality is required in Theorem A.1 of Burke <ref> [3] </ref>. The above example also shows that a face may not be exposed by a vector d 2 ri fN (F )g. In the remainder of this section we show that F is exposed by a vector d 2 ri fN (F )g if F is a quasi-polyhedral face.

Reference-contexts: However, we show that there is a face F (x fl ) such that x k 2 F (x fl ) for all k sufficiently large. The approach in this paper is reminiscent of the approach of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref>. In particular, the approach depends on the concept of an exposed face, and on the facial geometry of a convex set . These results are developed in Sections 2 and 3. <p> Section 4 also contains a discussion of the connection of these result to the identification results of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref>, and to the convergence results for the class of trust region methods for bound constrained optimization problems proposed by Conn, Gould, and Toint [7, 8]. <p> 2 by defining a normal cone N (F ) and a tangent cone T (F ) for each F 2 F by N (F ) j N (x); T (F ) j T (x); x 2 ri (F ) : This definition relies on the result of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> that normal and tangent cones are independent of x 2 ri (F ) for any F 2 F. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of faces is easily shown to be a face, but the union of faces is not necessarily a face. <p> In the remainder of this section we show that F is exposed by a vector d 2 ri fN (F )g if F is a quasi-polyhedral face. This result is of interest because it leads to a connection with the identification results of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> for general convex sets. However, note that the remainder of this section is not needed for the main results in this paper. Burke and More [4] defined quasi-polyhedral faces in terms of the lineality of the tangent cone T (x). <p> This result is of interest because it leads to a connection with the identification results of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> for general convex sets. However, note that the remainder of this section is not needed for the main results in this paper. Burke and More [4] defined quasi-polyhedral faces in terms of the lineality of the tangent cone T (x). Recall that for a cone K in IR n , the lineality lin fKg of the cone K is the largest subspace contained in K. Hence, lin fKg = K " (K). Definition. <p> Also note that has six quasi-polyhedral faces and that these faces are exposed by any vector d 2 ri fN (F )g. Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> show that the lineality of the tangent cone is the orthogonal complement of the normal cone, that is, lin fT (x)g = N (x) ? ; where the orthogonal complement S ? of a set S is the subspace of vectors v such that hv; wi = 0 for all <p> We then use this result to extend Lemma 3.3 of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref>. As we shall see, this extension is crucial to the results on exposing constraints. Our development requires a few basic properties of projection operators. <p> 2.1 imply that P [K (d fl )] ae &gt; &lt; [ P [F + N (F )] &gt; = = &gt; &lt; [ F &gt; = = E (d fl ); and thus x k 2 E (d fl ) for all k sufficiently large. ffi Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> proved a similar result for general by assuming that x fl 2 ri fF g for a quasi-polyhedral face F and d fl 2 ri fN (F )g. <p> An advantage of this definition is that it does not make any linear independence assumptions on the constraints. Also note that Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> proved that if is polyhedral, then x fl is nondegenerate if and only if there is a set of positive Lagrange multipliers. This result implies that this definition of nondegeneracy can be viewed as a generalization of the standard strict complementarity condition. <p> This result implies that this definition of nondegeneracy can be viewed as a generalization of the standard strict complementarity condition. The main result of this section is an extension of the following identification result of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref>. For this result recall that F (x) is the unique face of that contains x in the relative interior. Theorem 4.1 Let f : IR n ! IR be continuously differentiable on the closed, convex set . <p> Theorem 4.1 characterizes the limiting behavior of many algorithms with respect to the face structure of . For example, Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> prove that the sequential quadratic programming algorithm and the gradient projection algorithm generate sequences that satisfy (4.2). Consequently, if the stationary point x fl is nondegenerate, the sequences generated by these algorithms eventually enter and remain in the relative interior of the face F (x fl ). <p> This can be extremely useful knowledge in the design of algorithms for the solution of (1.1). Note that Theorem 4.1 gives information on the identification of the active constraints. This is based on the observation of Burke and More <ref> [4] </ref> that ri fF (x fl )g = fx 2 : hc j ; xi = ffi j ; j 2 A (x fl ); hc j ; xi &gt; ffi j ; j =2 A (x fl )g : Thus, Theorem 4.1 shows that if fx k g is a <p> We now establish an alternative charac terization of A (F ). For the proof of this result we need to know that d 2 ri fN (x)g () d = i2A (x) This characterization of ri fN (x)g is due to Burke and More <ref> [4, Lemma 3.2] </ref>. Lemma 5.1 If is a polyhedral set, then F = fx 2 : hc i ; xi = ffi i ; i 2 A (F )g for any face F of . Proof.

Reference-contexts: in particular, that if is the polyhedral set defined by the set of linear constraints = fx 2 IR n : hc j ; xi ffi j ; 1 j mg ; (4:3) for some vectors c j 2 IR n and scalars ffi j , then Calamai and More <ref> [6] </ref> proved that the projected gradient that appears in (4.2) can be expressed in the familiar form P T (x) [rf (x)] = rf (x) + j2A (x) where the set of active constraints is defined by A (x) j fj : hc j ; xi = ffi j g; and <p> Theorem 4.4 shows that x 2 E [rf (x fl )] () fi 2 A (x fl ) : fl Thus, the result is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.2. ffi This result has immediate applications to several algorithms. For example, Calamai and More <ref> [6] </ref> show that the gradient projection method generates sequences that satisfy (4.6). Hence, Theorem 4.5 implies that if the sequence fx k g generated by the gradient projection method converges to x fl , then (4.7) holds. <p> Let K GP be the set of indices k such that x k+1 is generated by the gradient projection method.

Reference-contexts: For future reference, we state this result formally. Theorem 2.1 If F is the collection of all faces of the convex set , then the collection fri (F ) : F 2 Fg is a partition of . This result can be found, for example, in Rockafellar <ref> [22, Theorem 18.2] </ref>. Note that this result shows that every point x 2 can be associated with a unique face F (x) of such that x 2 ri (F ). We are concerned with faces of that are exposed by a given vector d in IR n . <p> Clearly, both Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 yield this result. In the proof of the lemma below we make use of the result that if is polyhedral then has a finite number of faces. This result can be found, for example, in Rockafellar <ref> [22, Theorem 19.1] </ref>. We also need to know that if is closed and convex, then any face of is closed. For this result, see Stoer and Witzgall [23, Theorem 3.6.6]. Lemma 3.3 Assume that is a polyhedral set in IR n .

Reference-contexts: A computation shows that E (d) is a face whenever E (d) is not empty. Every face of a polyhedron is exposed (see, for example, Theorem 2.4.12 of Stoer and Witzgall <ref> [23] </ref>), but this is not the case for general convex sets. For example, in the convex set defined by = ( 1 ; 2 ) : 1 2 (1 2 1 oe the point (1; 0) is a face of that is not exposed by any vector. <p> This result is valid if T (x) is replaced by a general convex cone K. See, for example, Stoer and Witzgall <ref> [23, Theorem 2.10.5] </ref>. 6 Theorem 2.5 A quasi-polyhedral face F of a convex set is exposed by any d 2 ri fN (F )g. Proof. <p> This result can be found, for example, in Rockafellar [22, Theorem 19.1]. We also need to know that if is closed and convex, then any face of is closed. For this result, see Stoer and Witzgall <ref> [23, Theorem 3.6.6] </ref>. Lemma 3.3 Assume that is a polyhedral set in IR n . If x 2 and d 2 N (x), then x + d 2 intfK (d)g; where K (d) = F 2F (d) and F (d) is defined in Lemma 2.3. 9 Proof. <p> Lemma 5.1 If is a polyhedral set, then F = fx 2 : hc i ; xi = ffi i ; i 2 A (F )g for any face F of . Proof. Every face of a polyhedron is exposed (see, for example, Theorem 2.4.12 of Stoer and Witzgall <ref> [23] </ref>), and thus F = E (d) for some d 2 IR n . Hence, Theorem 2.4 implies 16 that d 2 ri fN (F )g, and thus d 2 ri fN (x)g for any x 2 ri fF g.
