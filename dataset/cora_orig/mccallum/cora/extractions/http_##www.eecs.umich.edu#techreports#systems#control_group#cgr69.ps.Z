Reference-contexts: Their papers deal with generalizations of the norms to sampled-data systems. Also, the optimal control problem has been addressed in papers by Chen and Francis [4], Juan and Kabamba [9], Bamieh and Pearson <ref> [2] </ref> and Khargonekar and Sivashankar [15]. In this paper, we will analyze sampled-data systems where the inputs are bounded signals and two signal norms are considered, namely the norm, and the norm. We will present some results on the corresponding induced operator norms of sampled-data systems.

Reference-contexts: Then, where the subscript and represent the th row and the th column respectively. get . So we now have a method for approximating the -induced norm of the sampled-data system arbitrarily closely. A result similar to Proposition 4.2 is found in <ref> [7] </ref>. It is clear that the approximation that we get using Proposition 4.2 is only a lower bound on the -induced norm. Using finite term approximation to the infinite series and first order approximation to the integral in the formula for the -induced norm we can get other lower bounds.

Reference-contexts: We also give an approximation to the - induced operator norm of a given sampled-data system. Induced operator norms play a major role in the robust stability and performance analysis and synthesis of sampled-data systems. Recently, Sivashankar and Khargonekar <ref> [18] </ref> have obtained some analysis results using induced norms for sampled-data systems. In Section 2 we define our notation and set up the framework for sampled-data feedback system analysis. We also formulate our main analysis problem in this section. <p> Define the induced operator norm := : = 0 We state a proposition next, which gives a way of approximating the -induced norm arbi trarily closely. lim = (12) The proof of the proposition is not given here and the interested reader can look it up elsewhere <ref> [17, 18] </ref>.
