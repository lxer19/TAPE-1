Abstract: We consider a heterogeneous database system (HDBMS) with a global object schema, and remote target databases that may be relational or object-oriented. The problem is to transform an initial query, posed against the global object schema in an object query language, into simplified queries that can be efficiently processed against some remote target databases. In the HDBMS, query optimization is made difficult by schematic discrepancy, and the need to model mapping information between the global and target schema(s). In this paper, we address this problem by representing the mappings from a target schema to the global schema, as a set of heterogeneous object equivalences, in an algebraic language. These equivalences are the basis for defining the heterogeneous search space of an HDBMS optimizer. We extend a modular rule-based query optimizer to produce simplified optimized queries for the HDBMS. The main result, reported in this paper, is the ability of the optimizer to uniformly perform syntactic simplifications, logical and semantic equivalence trans - formations, as well as heterogeneous equivalence transformations.
