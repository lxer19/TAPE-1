Reference-contexts: Furthermore, these planners do not handle the temporal aspects of the prepositioning problem. Jim Blythe has developed a planner, Weaver, that more directly addresses the problem of reacting to exogenous events <ref> (Blythe 1996) </ref>. This planner generates a plan for a main line of execution, then incrementally adds significant domain events and plans reactions to these events. However, Weaver, like the conditional planners, does not address temporal aspects of the prepositioning problem.

Reference-contexts: The first such planner was Warren's Warplan-C (Warren 1976). More recently, causal link planners have been extended to conditional planners by Peot and Smith (1992), Pryor and Collins (1996), and Goldman and Boddy (1994). The UWL SENSp softbot planner also did some conditional planning <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1992) </ref>. These conditional planners all make the same extension to classical AI planners: they permit nondeterministic actions that have multiple possible outcomes.

Reference-contexts: The Cassini Prepositioning Problem The Cassini prepositioning problem was originally outlined by Erann Gat in his paper "News From the Trenches: An Overview of Unmanned Spacecraft for AI" <ref> (Gat 1996) </ref>. The problem concerns the Saturn orbit insertion maneuver planned for the Cassini spacecraft. The spacecraft has a narrow time window during which it must fire its thrusters to decrease its speed and enter the desired Saturn orbit.

Reference-contexts: The RTS will then detect these signals like any other state feature. Our preliminary investigations suggest that we can detect the need for such features through search failures in the AIS. The higher-level CIRCA mission planner/scheduler or "task-level planner" <ref> (Musliner 1993) </ref> plays a major role in managing the state-space planner's activities and the sequence of plans executed by the RTS.

Reference-contexts: One approach to preposi-tioning problems is offered by "conditional planners." These are conventional AI planning systems that have been extended so that they can generate plans with embedded "if-then-else" structures. The first such planner was Warren's Warplan-C <ref> (Warren 1976) </ref>. More recently, causal link planners have been extended to conditional planners by Peot and Smith (1992), Pryor and Collins (1996), and Goldman and Boddy (1994). The UWL SENSp softbot planner also did some conditional planning (Etzioni et al. 1992).
