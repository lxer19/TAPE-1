Title: Numerical conformal mapping using cross-ratios and Delaunay triangulation  
Author: Tobin A. Driscoll Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: January 23, 1996  
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for computing the Riemann mapping of the unit disk to a polygon, also known as the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. The new algorithm, CRDT, is based on cross-ratios of the prevertices, and also on cross-ratios of quadrilaterals in a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon. The CRDT algorithm produces an accurate representation of the Riemann mapping even in the presence of arbitrary long, thin regions in the polygon, unlike any previous conformal mapping algorithm. We believe that CRDT can never fail to converge to the correct Riemann mapping, but the correctness and convergence proof depend on conjectures that we have so far not been able to prove. We demonstrate convergence with computational experiments. The Riemann mapping has applications to problems in two-dimensional potential theory and to finite-difference mesh generation. We use CRDT to produce a mapping and solve a boundary value problem on long, thin regions for which no other algorithm can solve these problems.

Reference-contexts: See Fig. 1 for an example of a triangulation and its dual. Among all triangulations of P , there is a distinguished triangulation known as the constrained Delaunay triangulation or just the Delaunay triangulation <ref> [1] </ref>. This is a triangulation with the following (defining) property: If d is a diagonal of the triangulation, let Q (d) be the quadrilateral associated with d, that is, the union of the two triangles on either side of d.

Reference-contexts: We repeat this until all edges are well-separated. See Fig. 3 for an example of both phases of the splitting process. The splitting of edges and protecting of sharp angles is reminiscent of techniques previously introduced in the finite-element mesh generation literature; see for example <ref> [2, 4, 15] </ref>. In the mesh generation literature, the purpose of these techniques is similar to our own purpose, namely, to prevent the occurrence of poorly shaped triangles that could arise in a triangulation of the original (unsplit) polygon.

Reference-contexts: Repeat until no flips are possible. This is the algorithm used in our computational tests, although a more efficient O (n log n) algorithm for constrained Delaunay triangulation was developed by Chew <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Splitting edges The first step of our algorithm is to split some edges of the polygon. Splitting an edge means replacing it by several smaller edges whose union is equal to the original edge. These new edges are joined by vertices whose angles are .

Reference-contexts: Instead we use two variations of the nonlinear equation solver NESOLVE due to Behrens, which is based on a Gauss-Newton method with a Broy-den update of F 0 , as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. This is the same nonlinear system package used by the SC Toolbox. In one variant, Full CRDT, we use the standard finite-difference Jacobian to seed the Broyden update. In the other, Shortcut CRDT, we attempt to exploit the monotonicity by setting the initial F 0 = I.

Reference-contexts: But two difficulties limit the generality of polygons these packages can map: 2 * The system of nonlinear equations does not have any special structure that lends itself to easy solution. In fact, the system can have local minima that can trap nonlinear solvers and prevent convergence entirely <ref> [9] </ref>. * More important, SCPACK and the SC Toolbox cannot generally handle crowding, a phenomenon of conformal mapping that occurs whenever the domain has any long, narrow channel [14]. <p> One partial solution to the problem of crowding in the SC Toolbox is its provision for mapping elongated domains to rectangles. The elongation in the domain can be matched by a similar elongation in image rectangle, alleviating the crowding problem <ref> [9, 12] </ref>. While this technique can be generalized to certain classes of multiply elongated polygons [11], the technique becomes much more delicate, and the fundamental domain is no longer a disk. We propose a new algorithm that remedies both of these deficiencies. <p> The horizontal slits cannot move past each other without temporarily increasing the solution residual. tive. In contrast, experiments indicate the nonlinear system used by SCPACK and the SC Toolbox does not have strong monotonicity properties and in fact is prone to local minima <ref> [9] </ref>. This is demonstrated by Fig. 7. If dparam of the SC Toolbox is used to solve for the polygon on the left in the figure, it arrives at the polygon on the right and terminates due to an apparent local minimum in the system. <p> The minimum results from the fact that the two horizontal slits cannot be moved past each other without temporarily increasing the solution residual. (The fact that part of the plane is covered more than once is irrelevant.) This phenomenon was first described by Howell <ref> [9] </ref>, who also points out that crowding often masks the effect.

Reference-contexts: How should we choose the initial triangle and embed its prevertices? It turns out that any initialization is acceptable; all embeddings give the same image polygon, up to similarity transform. To show this, we begin by recalling some standard facts from complex analysis <ref> [16] </ref>. First, any conformal map from the unit disk to itself is a fractional linear transformation of the form g (z) = e i z r ; (5) where r is a complex number such that jrj &lt; 1 and 2 [0; 2). <p> As a consequence, there is a unique such mapping that takes any three distinct points on the unit circle to any other three points on the unit circle, preserving ordering <ref> [16] </ref>. We formalize another consequence in a lemma: Lemma 3 Let a; b; c; d be four points on the unit circle in counterclockwise order. Let g be a conformal mapping of the unit disk to itself. <p> Let g be a conformal mapping of the unit disk to itself. Then (a; b; c; d) = (g (a); g (b); g (c); g (d)): Proof. Simple algebra verifies that cross-ratios are invariant under fractional linear transformations. See <ref> [16] </ref> for details. We now show that no matter which initial triangle T 0 we select in Theorem 1, and no matter how we choose the positions of its three prevertices, we end up with the same image polygon, up to similarity transform.

Reference-contexts: By using ratios of sides, we can eliminate the affine scaling constants from the system, and by arbitrarily specifying the three degrees of freedom in the mapping, we can reduce the size of the square nonlinear system to n 3 [18]. Actual software packages for S-C mapping like SCPACK <ref> [17] </ref> and its cousin, the SC Toolbox for Matlab [7], solve such nonlinear systems numerically, after applying a transformation to the primitive variables that eliminates the need for explicit enforcement of the ordering constraints on the j 's. <p> The path of integration is a straight-line segment from the origin, and we use the compound Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rules described by Trefethen <ref> [17] </ref>. 6 On the circumvention of crowding In this section we explain the crux of our claim that CRDT is unaffected by crowding. If the domain P contains any long, narrow channel, then for any possible correct embedding of the prevertices, some of the prevertices will be extremely crowded. <p> This is accomplished by choosing points on the portion of the line local to Q i , inverting the rectified S-C map using Trefethen's 25 technique <ref> [17] </ref>, and computing the standard forward map from the same embedding. We believe that this technique can be refined to perform grid generation for any polygon. The main obstacle is in defining the rectified map in general, when a rectangle is not a natural choice.
