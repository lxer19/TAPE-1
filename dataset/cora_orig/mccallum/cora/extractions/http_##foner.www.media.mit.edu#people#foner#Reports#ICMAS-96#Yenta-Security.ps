Reference-contexts: RELATED WORK We are explicitly examining here only security designs for multi-agent systems not multiple agents, security, or cryptography in general. This is a relatively young area. Most efforts to date have focussed on security architectures for KQML (e.g., [16]) and on Java [2][10] and bugs in its security <ref> [3] </ref>. There is considerable room for fruitful interaction between researchers working on agents and those with experi ence in security and cryptography. CONCLUSIONS Multi-agent systems which handle personal data pose challenging problems of privacy and security. Careful system design can mitigate most of these problems without unaccept able performace penalties.
