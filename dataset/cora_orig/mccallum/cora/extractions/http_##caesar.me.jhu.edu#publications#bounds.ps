Title: Bounds for Self-Reconfiguration of Metamorphic Robots

Abstract: In this paper we examine the problem of dynamic self-reconfiguration of a class of modular robotic systems referred to as metamorphic systems. A metamorphic robotic system is a collection of mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. A change in the macroscopic morphology results from the locomotion of each module over its neighbors. In this paper, lower and upper bounds are established for the minimal number of moves needed to change such systems from any initial to any final specified configuration. These bounds are functions of initial and final configuration geometry and can be computed very quickly, while solving for the precise number of minimal moves cannot be done in polynomial time. These bounds can be used to `weed out' and improve inefficient reconfiguration strategies, and provide a benchmark for the evaluation of heuristics in general.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we formalize the motion planning/reconfiguration problem. In Section 4 and 5 we establish upper and lower bounds respectively on the 1 number of moves required to reconfigure between any given initial and final configurations. For a review of pertinent literature, see <ref> [Ch94] </ref>. 2 Defining Distance Between Modules One way to view space is as a collection of connected close-packed polyhedra (which is often referred to as a `tessellation' of space), the centers and/or vertices of which form a regular lattice.

Reference-contexts: In fact, a number of works have dealt with the enumeration of configurations composed of modules [ChB93,Go65,HaP73,HaR70,Lu72], and the general problem is to the best of our knowledge still unsolved. For example, in the simplified case dealt with in <ref> [HaR70] </ref> for hexagonal cells (modules), the number of configurations generated (N ) is asymptotic to N = (n 1)!(n + 1)! 5 5; (1) where n is the number of modules.

Reference-contexts: This minimal sum will be at most the aforementioned lower bound. Since this is something that can be computed relatively efficiently (in at most O (n 3 ) computations, see <ref> [PECh95] </ref> for details), this is the lower bound we will use. The basic approach is summarized below. Let the present configuration of the robot be described by the set of modules A, where a i 2 A represents a module in configuration A for i = 1; :::; n.
