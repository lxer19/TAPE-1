Abstract: The study presented in this paper empirically compares the amount of communicative breakdown experienced by participants collaboratively performing a task in three communication environments: faceto-face, mediated by an audio connection, and mediated by both an audio and a video connection. Results showed significantly less breakdown in the copresent condition than in either of the two technologically-mediated environments; no differences were found between audio-only and audio-video conditions. Analysis of how participants in the audio-video environment used the remote video image revealed profound pragmatic differences in the visual access afforded by a video image versus physical copresence for task-oriented interactions.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in evaluating the extent to which current technologies achieve this goal by empirically comparing copresent to technologically-mediated interaction. For example, several studies have either formally or informally compared user satisfaction across various environments <ref> [2, 8, 14, 22] </ref> . Another approach has been to compare the quality of work produced by copresent participants to that of participants collaborating in technologically-mediated environments [22]. <p> In this respect, the results of this study support existing comparisons of user satisfaction in similar environments, which found that users overwhelmingly preferred copresent to distributed interaction <ref> [2, 14, 22] </ref>. <p> While a video connection has been found to be useful for supporting passive awareness between collaborators, e.g. Is Mary is her office?, [7, 18], its utility in support of active problemsolving interactions is questionable <ref> [2, 13, 17, 19, 20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The analysis was structured by recognizing three fundamental conversational tasks 1 that must be continuously addressed by participants in any interaction in order to maintain mutual intelligibility: 1 This framework draws on the extensive literature in Conversation Analysis and linguistics where each of these tasks has generated considerable interest <ref> [e.g. 3, 4, 24] </ref>. 1) Turntaking. Participants must organize their contri - butions to the interaction. For example, participants must regulate access to the verbal floor in order to avoid overlapping talk. 2) Topic.

Reference-contexts: Reference breakdowns were evidenced by explicit verbal repair sequences, initiated either by the speaker or the listener, in which the referential confusion was made apparent to both participants and collabora - tively resolved. Though space does not permit more detailed discussion (but see <ref> [5] </ref> ), the criteria developed to operationalize each of these categories were very conservative. <p> The segments of transcript shown on the following page present examples of Cursor turntaking and Reference breakdown to illustrate this insensitivity to nonverbal displays.

Reference-contexts: Seven female-female pairs, three male-male pairs, and two male-female pairs were selected and randomly assigned to the three communicative environments described earlier.
