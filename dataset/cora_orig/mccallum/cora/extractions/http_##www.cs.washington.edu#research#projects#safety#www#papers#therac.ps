Title: Medical Devices: The Therac-25

Reference-contexts: The FDA concluded by rating this a Class I recall: a recall in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death <ref> [1] </ref>. AECL sent more supporting documentation to the FDA on June 5, 1987, including the CAP test plan, a draft operator's manual, and the draft of the new safety analysis.

Reference-contexts: According to a 1990 GAO study, the FDA knew of less than 1 percent of deaths, serious injuries, or equipment malfunctions that occurred in hospitals <ref> [2] </ref>. The law was amended in 1990 to require health-care facilities to report incidents to the manufacturer and to the FDA. At this point, the other Therac-25 users were also unaware that anything untoward had occurred and did not learn about any problems with the machine until after subsequent accidents.

Reference-contexts: Through experimentation, he found that certain editing sequences correlated with blown fuses and determined that the same computer bug (as in the Therac-25 software) was responsible. The physicist notified the FDA, which notified Therac-20 users <ref> [3] </ref>. The software error is just a nuisance on the Therac-20 because this machine has independent hardware protective circuits for monitoring the electron beam scanning. The protective circuits do not allow the beam to turn on, so there is no danger of radiation exposure to a patient.

Reference-contexts: These accidents have been described as the worst in the 35-year history of medical accelerators [6]. A detailed accident investigation, drawn from publicly available documents, can be found in Leveson and Turner <ref> [4] </ref>. The following account is taken from this report and includes both the factors involved in the overdoses themselves and the attempts by the users, manufacturers, and governments to deal with them. <p> In a letter to a Therac-25 user, the AECL quality assurance manager said, "The same Therac-6 package was used by the AECL software people when they started the Therac-25 software. The Therac-20 and Therac-25 software programs were done independently starting from a common base" <ref> [4] </ref>. The reuse of Therac-6 design features or modules may explain some of the problematic aspects of the Therac-25 software design. <p> FDA memos point to the lack of a mechanism in AECL to follow up reports of suspected accidents <ref> [4] </ref>. The patient went home, but shortly afterward she developed a reddening and swelling in the center of the treatment area. Her pain had increased to the point that her shoulder "froze," and she experienced spasms.

Reference-contexts: A Medical Devices: The Therac-25 7 long to enter the treatment plan. In response, AECL modified the software before the first unit was installed: Instead of reentering the data at the keyboard, operators could simply use a carriage return to copy the treatment site data <ref> [5] </ref>. A quick series of carriage returns would thus complete the data entry. This modification was to figure in several of the accidents. The Therac-25 could shut down in two ways after it detected an error condition. One was a treatment suspend, which required a complete machine reset to restart.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Between June 1985 and January 1987, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine, called the Therac-25, massively overdosed six people. These accidents have been described as the worst in the 35-year history of medical accelerators <ref> [6] </ref>. A detailed accident investigation, drawn from publicly available documents, can be found in Leveson and Turner [4]. The following account is taken from this report and includes both the factors involved in the overdoses themselves and the attempts by the users, manufacturers, and governments to deal with them. <p> In addition, operator-mounted electron trimmers can be used to shape the beam if necessary. For X-ray (or photon) therapy, only one energy level is available: 25 MeV. Much greater electron-beam current is required for X-ray mode (some 100 times greater than that for electron therapy) <ref> [6] </ref> to produce comparable output. Such a high dose-rate capability is required because a "beam flattener" is used to produce a uniform treatment field. <p> Except for a few incidents in the 1960's (e.g., at Hammersmith, Hamburg) the use of medical accelerators has been remarkably free of serious radiation accidents until now. Perhaps, though we have been spoiled by this success <ref> [6] </ref>. This problem seems to be common in all fields. Unrealistic Risk Assessments. The first hazard analyses initially ignored software, and then they treated it superficially by assuming that all software errors were equally likely.

Reference-contexts: The consequences of an overdose to a smaller part of the body depend on the tissue's radio-sensitivity. The director of radiation oncology at the Kennestone facility explained their confusion about the accident as due to the fact that they had never seen an overtreatment of that magnitude before <ref> [7] </ref>. Eventually, the patient's breast had to be removed because of the radiation burns. Her shoulder and arm were paralyzed, and she was in constant App. A Medical Devices: The Therac-25 11 pain.
