Reference-contexts: This approach leverages off the existing e-mail infrastructure. It takes advantage of the many users who are not only reachable via e-mail, but also who readily publicize their e-mail addresses, and thus can offer high user buy-in <ref> [3] </ref>. However, this scheme requires people to read mail often (at least to respond to an invitation in a timely fashion) and with high volumes of e-mail, a user might even have difficulty finding the invitation.

Reference-contexts: better address re-use of these same multicast addresses in other parts of the network. 1.3 Multicast and the MBone Why base the user directory architecture on a multicast protocol? Presently, the most successful large-scale experiments in telecollaboration have occurred within the Multicast Backbone (MBone), a multicast-capable portion of the Internet <ref> [4] </ref>. The MBone relies on Internet Protocol (IP) multi-cast at the internetworking layer to propagate data efficiently to a group of destinations [10].

Reference-contexts: The initiator's mmcc is responsible for collecting these responses from the remote mmccs and retransmitting the invitation until either a reply is received or its own timeout is reached. Subsequently, the program spawns familiar MBone audio, video and groupware tools (e.g., nv [9], vat [35], wb <ref> [6] </ref>) that allow participants to collaborate over the network in realtime.

Reference-contexts: However, because all ttl scopes have a minimum timer value, which can be found by calling min ttl timer, next timer is set to the minimum of interval and the minimum timer value, min interval. To avoid timers getting synchronized across participating registries <ref> [7] </ref>, unsynch timers performs the final adjustment to the next timer interval, by randomly setting the timer to an amount from the uniform distribution on the interval [0:5T; 1:5T ], where T is next timer.

Reference-contexts: Although not often used as the point for synchronous rendezvous, it has begun to serve as a launching off point <ref> [8] </ref>, in the same way that one's email address serves this purpose. Because the Web homepage address often is widely distributed, the easy user buy-in argument applies here as well. Perhaps the most compelling aspect about a Web page is that its links connote associations among pages.

Reference-contexts: The MBone relies on Internet Protocol (IP) multi-cast at the internetworking layer to propagate data efficiently to a group of destinations <ref> [10] </ref>. A multicast address is distinguished from its unicast counterpart in several ways: * A multicast address is selected from a range in the Internet address space, 224.x.x.x, whereas a unicast address can reside anywhere else in the address space (from 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255).

Reference-contexts: This of course would depend on to what extent users remain subscribed (announcing and listening) on the directory multicast address. Will multicast routers be able to support such a large distribution group? With routing algorithms such as Protocol Independent Mulicast (PIM), there are additional operational concerns <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To conduct multiparty conversations, peer mmccs participate in a request-response messaging protocol <ref> [12] </ref>. When a user initiates a multimedia session, that user notifies its mmcc, becoming the initiator of the session. The initiator's mmcc sends invitation requests to the remote mmccs of users invited to participate in the session. <p> When a teleconferencing session is created, mmcc selects the maximum of the minimum ttl values between all group members and includes this value as part of the session description in the session invitation protocol <ref> [12] </ref>. The group scope in turn is passed to the associated media tools for proper scoping of the multicast real-time data.

Reference-contexts: For instance, a session description might convey who else has been invited, the topic of the session, configuration information such as which media to spawn and which media encoding schemes to use, the intended start and finish time of the conference, among other details <ref> [13] </ref>. Once a request is received by a peer mmcc, the associated user is notified by the graphical user interface (GUI) and asked to respond to the invitation. 11 The invitee's mmcc eventually either sends a user response or allows the request to expire. <p> The timer interval is doubled with each expiration. 3.3.4 Message Content Table 3.2 displays the format of an announcement message. Following the trend of HTTP, SDP, and other text-based protocols [29] <ref> [13] </ref> [30], the directory announcement messages are sent as text for easy portability and parsing. The generic contents of the announcements include four attributes: the user alias (u), user login id (l), host machine name (h), and host machine address (a). These constitute the required elements of an announcement message. <p> Consequently, sd and sdr often overdistribute session announcements, and thus the associated session data flows. A useful modification to the original session directory is the idea that the specification of session descriptions <ref> [13] </ref> has been separated from the specification of the session announcement protocol [37]. We would like to devise an equivalent separation of description from announcement.

Reference-contexts: Instead, participation is locally controlled by each individual joiner. The implied session policy, is to allow anyone to join who obtains the session address itself; this is akin to selecting a particular TV channel. Collaborative Web schemes also operate in this fashion <ref> [18] </ref>. When users browse on the same Web page, they become part of the same synchronous real-time session. Again, there is an implied agreement to be part of the same association and there is no explicit invitation process.

Reference-contexts: The mechanisms behind the user directory architecture are well suited to be used toward implementing whois++ servers. The Domain Name Service (DNS) provides a hierarchical architecture that allows mapping machine names into machine addresses, bridging the machine-human interface problem <ref> [20] </ref>. In recent years, the DNS has been extended to store information records that pertain to additional network resources, such as mail server addresses which could be used as a first-stage mechanism for locating users (e.g., schooler@cs.caltech.edu) [26].

Reference-contexts: interest in the user directory problem stems not only from the burgeoning field of computer-supported cooperative work, but also from our field testing of mmcc 1 , a software tool that performs session orchestration, i.e., 1 mmcc is an acronym for multimedia conference control tool. 1 initiates multiperson networked collaborations <ref> [21] </ref>. Each mmcc acts on be-half of the user who runs it. When a user requests the initiation of a session a conference consisting of a variety of underlying media or applications - that user's mmcc sends invitations to peer mmccs, each of which acts on behalf of its user.

Reference-contexts: This can be kept constant through adaptive periodicity. There is precedent already in RTCP and sd <ref> [24] </ref> [36]. The announcement periodicity is adjusted based on the number of other announcements heard at that ttl. These adjustments occur at each ring of scope.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, the DNS has been extended to store information records that pertain to additional network resources, such as mail server addresses which could be used as a first-stage mechanism for locating users (e.g., schooler@cs.caltech.edu) <ref> [26] </ref>. Although the DNS has not traditionally been used for user location, it is our intuition that its hierarchical framework would combine well with multicast to improve scaling properties. 7.4 Bootstrapping It is often difficult to initialize distributed services because of complicated configuration procedures.

Reference-contexts: A common solution to this bootstrapping problem is to use a shared address that binds related resources together. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) uses this technique in the local area <ref> [31] </ref>. It relies on a shared broadcast address to resolve Internet addresses into link-level addresses. For the wide area, broadcast communication is prohibitively wasteful. Instead, multicast has been used to more efficiently supply a shared address.

Reference-contexts: Nor is there stability in routing among networked objects, since the topology of the network is ever-changing and routes are sometimes transient. The distributed and dynamical nature of the system means that cooperating resource servers can never entirely know if/when there is consensus about the state of all resources <ref> [34] </ref>. Thus, we promote a design that does not require consensus. Each individual mmcc trusts its own catalog of information as a reflection of its connectivity to the rest of the world.

Reference-contexts: The initiator's mmcc is responsible for collecting these responses from the remote mmccs and retransmitting the invitation until either a reply is received or its own timeout is reached.

Reference-contexts: For instance, LBL's session directory tool, sd, provides a multicast address for users to join to participate in a session <ref> [36] </ref>. This circumvents having to know who else is part of a session or whom to contact for approval to join. Instead, participation is locally controlled by each individual joiner. <p> This can be kept constant through adaptive periodicity. There is precedent already in RTCP and sd [24] <ref> [36] </ref>.

The distributed announcement protocol was inspired by sd's session announcement technique [37]. However, our user registry tracks users, whereas the session registry tracks sessions. Thus the user registry has an even more critical scaling problem to solve.

Reference-contexts: The whois service is transaction-based and centralized, but does not scale [40]. Its successor whois++ provides a hierarchy of servers that support structured queries and an indexing capability. Although the client-server protocol has been outlined, the server's abilities to gather information are intentionally left unspecified <ref> [39] </ref>. The mechanisms behind the user directory architecture are well suited to be used toward implementing whois++ servers.

Reference-contexts: A similar technique is used by the service location protocol, a parallel effort which proposes a general purpose protocol that allows users in the local area to find common services, such as printers or 57 other resources <ref> [41] </ref>. Like the user directory protocol, there is a common multicast address shared by all server location servers. A client queries a server for the location of one of these common services. Each type of resource is in turn addressable via a multicast address.

Reference-contexts: The intent however is for the service location server to provide the mapping between well-known services and the possibly dynamic addresses assigned to them in different administrative locations, behaving very much like the RPC portmapper <ref> [42] </ref>. Again, the user directory could be integrated as one component in the service location architecture. However, the service location protocol is not meant for the wide area. An alternate technology for service location is called anycasting.
