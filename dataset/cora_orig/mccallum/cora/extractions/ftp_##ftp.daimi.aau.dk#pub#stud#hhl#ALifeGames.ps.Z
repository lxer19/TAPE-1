Abstract: Entertaining and educating game tools can be build using techniques derived from the field of Artificial Life. Six different games that all make use of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms are presented, and their use as educational tools in biology and psychology curricula are discussed. The games help students at all levels understand concepts about Darwinian evolution theory (selective pressure, mutation, etc.), ecological meanings of population density and resource needing. Further, the pedagogic perspectives of Piaget's cognitive development theories are enlarged through the use and study of artificial organisms that are represented by real robots. This is done by games where students are allowed to modify artificial organisms both at the level of brain, body, and behavior. Thereby, they are able to study the interaction and close relationship between brain, body and behavior. Two other games play with face expressions and aesthetics. These games allow psychological studies of learning processes in young children's development of the ability to read and use face expressions, and in artists' development of art. The games are currently being used in a therapeutic context by therapists who work with mentally diseased children.
