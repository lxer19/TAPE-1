Title: Partial Surface and Volume Matching in Three Dimensions  
Author: Gill Barequet Micha Sharir 
Keyword: geometric hashing, computer vision, pattern recognition, partial surface matching, protein matching, molecule docking.  
Abstract: In this paper we present a new technique for partial surface and volume matching of images in three dimensions. In this problem we are given two objects in 3-space, each represented as a set of points, and the goal is to find a rigid motion of one object which makes a sufficiently large portion of its boundary lying sufficiently close to a corresponding portion of the boundary of the second object. This is an important problem in pattern recognition and in computer vision, with many industrial, medical, and chemical applications. Our method treats separately the rotation and the translation components of the Euclidean motion that we seek. The algorithm steps through a sequence of rotations, in a steepest-descent style, and uses a novel technique for scoring the match for any fixed rotation. Experimental results on various examples, involving data from industrial applications, medical imaging, and molecular biology, are presented, and show the accurate and robust performance of our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Traditional methods for detecting structural motifs in proteins usually employ algorithms for string comparison, where the strings represent the primary structures (amino acid sequences) of the proteins. A survey of these methods is found in [74]. Enhanced methods <ref> [1, 67, 73] </ref> also consider predefined motifs (such as the so-called ff-helixes and fi-sheets) in the secondary structures of the molecules. A major contribution to these problems was achieved by application of techniques based on geometric hashing. This method facilitates the handling of a priori totally unknown 3-dimensional structures.

Reference-contexts: Partial volume matching can also aid in the detection of structural motifs (sequences of amino acids that have similar spatial structure) in proteins, thus adding to the understanding of their role and functionality <ref> [2] </ref>. Yet another motivation is the combination of several snapshots of the same object, taken from different view points, in order to obtain a description of a bigger portion of its boundary. <p> Thus, the only factor that causes the votes not to be gathered at a single cell of the voting table is the scaling effected by S 2 sin 2 . Since the sine function sin 2 is continuous over the space of orientations 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref> and has a unique minimum (at 0) and a unique maximum (at ), we expect the voting table to be the most sparse when our `guess' ! deviates from the real by , i.e., when j !j = , to be the most dense when = !, and to

Reference-contexts: Horn [44] suggests instead to look for the maximum eigenvalue. (Although we do not use quaternions, we have used a similar idea for a variant of our approach; see Section 5.) Alternatively, Golub and van Loan [40] and Arun et al. <ref> [5] </ref> use singular value decomposition. The main deficiency of their method is relying on the existence of significantly large planar regions in the objects. Szeliski [80] uses a standard steepest descent heuristic for generating a series of rotations of one object relative to the other.

Reference-contexts: Potmesil [71, 72] describes a heuristic surface matching algorithm, which searches for the transformation that maximizes shape similarities in the registration of two objects, where the candidate transformations are evaluated at some selected points, e.g., surface control points and points of maximum curvature. Besl <ref> [9, 10] </ref> gives some metrics for measuring matches between curves and surfaces. Fisher [36] suggests heuristics for obtaining a registration between two objects by using their 2-dimensional boundaries (the so-called silhouettes).

Reference-contexts: This is acknowledged by many researchers as a major problem in object recognition (e.g., <ref> [11, p. 137] </ref>). It has important applications for robot task planning, assembly, inspection, and many additional industrial, military, and other applications. <p> Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a particular type of features, are pose-clustering [78], alignment [49], and geometric hashing. A comparison between these techniques is found in [83]. Comprehensive surveys on partial surface matching techniques in computer vision are found in <ref> [11, 23] </ref>. Many other works have addressed the problem, most of which have various limitations. <p> That is, every point p 2 A is first rotated by x around the x-axis, then rotated by y around the y-axis, and finally rotated by z around the z-axis. (Equivalent definitions are found elsewhere, e.g., in <ref> [11, p. 79] </ref>.) For each rotation R, we scan sequentially the generic voting list, compute the actual value of ! q ! R (p) for each voting pair (p; q), round its three components to integer numbers, and give the resulting triple one vote.

Reference-contexts: Taubin [81] approximates data point sets with algebraic surfaces up to the tenth degree, with an application to global position estimation (that is, without occlusion). Kamgar-Parsi et al. [54] present a "2.5-dimensional" registration method, which is actually a matching problem in 2-space. Besl and McKay <ref> [12] </ref> register 3-dimensional shapes (of various types) by using the so-called iterative closest point algorithm. This algorithm iteratively invokes a procedure which finds the closest member of a point set 2 to another given point.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm also makes intensive use of geometric hashing, but in a somewhat different setup. 1.1 Previous Work We first briefly review the fairly extensive literature on the problem of surface or volume matching, studied mainly in the context of computer vision and pattern recognition. Some works (e.g., <ref> [14] </ref>) depend on the ability to match significant features of the objects, like knobs and holes, whose existence is not usually guaranteed. Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a particular type of features, are pose-clustering [78], alignment [49], and geometric hashing.

First, we evaluate the scores of all the rotations ( x ; y ; z ), where x , y , and z range over all possible multiples of =3.

Reference-contexts: a too large ", might result in fi (n 2 ) access operations 10 to the hash table, which might make k also fi (n 2 ) in the worst case. (We could also achieve an O (n log 2 n + k) deterministic running time by using fractional cascading <ref> [21] </ref>.) Each scoring step consists of two substeps: (a) Creating the actual voting table, which takes O (k) time; and (b) Scoring the voting table, which takes O (s 3 ) time (since for each cell of the table we consider only a constant number of neighboring cells).

Faugeras [30] and Faugeras and Hebert <ref> [31] </ref> use quaternions for converting the 3-dimensional rotation problem into a 4-dimensional minimum eigenvalue problem, while the translation is found by using a standard least-squares technique. <p> This technique resembles the approaches taken in <ref> [3, 31, 44, 58, 82] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The next several examples are from molecular biology. The first two of them consist of the same input. The data describes two subunits (chains) of human deoxyhemoglobin (a protein found inside red cells of the human blood), having the well-known ff-fi dimer <ref> [32] </ref>. This dimer is reflected by a geometric match between portions of the boundaries of the two subunits, with volume complementarity near the matched boundaries. The data was obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, where it is denoted by 2HHB.

Reference-contexts: Horn [44] suggests instead to look for the maximum eigenvalue. (Although we do not use quaternions, we have used a similar idea for a variant of our approach; see Section 5.) Alternatively, Golub and van Loan <ref> [40] </ref> and Arun et al. [5] use singular value decomposition. The main deficiency of their method is relying on the existence of significantly large planar regions in the objects. Szeliski [80] uses a standard steepest descent heuristic for generating a series of rotations of one object relative to the other.

Reference-contexts: Some works (e.g., [14]) depend on the ability to match significant features of the objects, like knobs and holes, whose existence is not usually guaranteed. Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a particular type of features, are pose-clustering [78], alignment <ref> [49] </ref>, and geometric hashing. A comparison between these techniques is found in [83]. Comprehensive surveys on partial surface matching techniques in computer vision are found in [11, 23]. Many other works have addressed the problem, most of which have various limitations.

Reference-contexts: Medical image matching, however, usually involves a global match (registration) of a whole organ. Our work was motivated by earlier works on the partial curve matching technique, first proposed by Kalvin et al. <ref> [53] </ref> and by Schwartz and Sharir [75]. This technique, which uses the so-called geometric hashing method, was originally introduced for curve matching in the plane.

Reference-contexts: His goal is to minimize the sum of weighted differences (along the z-axis only) between points of the two objects. Taubin [81] approximates data point sets with algebraic surfaces up to the tenth degree, with an application to global position estimation (that is, without occlusion). Kamgar-Parsi et al. <ref> [54] </ref> present a "2.5-dimensional" registration method, which is actually a matching problem in 2-space. Besl and McKay [12] register 3-dimensional shapes (of various types) by using the so-called iterative closest point algorithm.

Given the correct rotation, we applied a simple correlation function similar to that described in <ref> [55] </ref> and in Section 4.4. We set c A = 15 and c B = 2. The program checked a 5 -A-grid of translations in the range of 30 A to 30 A in each direction, and found the correct translation to be (2; 0; 1). <p> Figures 9 (b,c) show the intersections with the plane X = 14:7 (at the original world coordinates). The matching area is seen between the upper right side of (b) and the lower left side of (c). These figures repeat the results presented at <ref> [55] </ref>. Next, we looked for a volume match between these two subunits of hemoglobin. The shapes of the two chains resembled each other, and indeed, the algorithm found a rotation and a translation, which made them almost fully overlap.

Reference-contexts: Their method assumes that the orientations of occurrences of the same object in successive images differ by only a relatively small amount. This work thus considers only translations, and explicitly assumes that the rotation component of the rigid motion of the object is relatively small. Finally, Lavalee and Szeliski <ref> [64] </ref> solve the 2D/3D matching problem by performing a least-square minimization of the "energy" needed to bring the projection lines of the camera contours tangent to the object. They do that efficiently by using a precomputed map of signed distances which are represented by an octree spline.

Reference-contexts: These overlaps reveal structural motifs which are common to the two chains. Indeed, the ff and the fi chains are very similar to each other in their tertiary structure, which consists of similar lengths of an ff-helix with bends of about the same angles and directions <ref> [65, p. 145] </ref>. We applied the same procedure in order to identify a similar ff-fi dimer of two subunits of horse methemoglobin (PDB code 2MHB). Here the areas of the matching boundary portions were smaller than those in the 2HHB case.

Reference-contexts: For the motif detection, Nussinov and Wolfson <ref> [69] </ref> define the footprint of each atom as its coordinates in systems defined by any non-colinear triple of atoms (thus each atom has O (n 3 ) footprints, where n is the number of atoms in the molecule). Similar ideas are presented in [33, 35].

Potmesil <ref> [71, 72] </ref> describes a heuristic surface matching algorithm, which searches for the transformation that maximizes shape similarities in the registration of two objects, where the candidate transformations are evaluated at some selected points, e.g., surface control points and points of maximum curvature.

Reference-contexts: Medical image matching, however, usually involves a global match (registration) of a whole organ. Our work was motivated by earlier works on the partial curve matching technique, first proposed by Kalvin et al. [53] and by Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [75] </ref>. This technique, which uses the so-called geometric hashing method, was originally introduced for curve matching in the plane.

Reference-contexts: These expectations were indeed fulfilled in all our experimentations, when a reasonable (partial) match did exist between the two objects. The navigation towards the optimum is a combination of a steepest descent <ref> [77] </ref> and a hierarchical pyramid [17] approaches. It is performed in three main phases. First, we evaluate the scores of all the rotations ( x ; y ; z ), where x , y , and z range over all possible multiples of =3.

Reference-contexts: Some works (e.g., [14]) depend on the ability to match significant features of the objects, like knobs and holes, whose existence is not usually guaranteed. Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a particular type of features, are pose-clustering <ref> [78] </ref>, alignment [49], and geometric hashing. A comparison between these techniques is found in [83]. Comprehensive surveys on partial surface matching techniques in computer vision are found in [11, 23]. Many other works have addressed the problem, most of which have various limitations.

Reference-contexts: Horn [43] and Brou [18] develop the extended Gaussian image method, which uses a surface normal histogram for matching convex (and some restricted nonconvex) shapes. Fang et al. [29] and Stockman and Esteva <ref> [79] </ref> solve a constrained registration problem between polyhedra, where only 2-dimensional translations and rotations are allowed. They extract some edge- and point-features, and accumulate a 3-dimensional histogram of possible matches, in which clusters are assumed to indicate possible matches.

Reference-contexts: The main deficiency of their method is relying on the existence of significantly large planar regions in the objects. Szeliski <ref> [80] </ref> uses a standard steepest descent heuristic for generating a series of rotations of one object relative to the other. His goal is to minimize the sum of weighted differences (along the z-axis only) between points of the two objects.

His goal is to minimize the sum of weighted differences (along the z-axis only) between points of the two objects. Taubin <ref> [81] </ref> approximates data point sets with algebraic surfaces up to the tenth degree, with an application to global position estimation (that is, without occlusion). Kamgar-Parsi et al. [54] present a "2.5-dimensional" registration method, which is actually a matching problem in 2-space.
