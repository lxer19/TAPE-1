Abstract: In this paper we report on our experience using WebSQL, a high level declarative query language for extracting information from the Web. WebSQL takes advantage of multiple index servers without requiring users to know about them, and integrates full-text with topology-based queries. The WebSQL query engine is a library of Java classes, and WebSQL queries can be embedded into Java programs much in the same way as SQL queries are embedded in C programs. This allows us to access the Web from Java at a much higher level of abstraction than bare HTTP requests. We illustrate the use of WebSQL for application development by describing two applications we are experimenting with: Web site maintenance and specialized index construction. We also sketch several other possible applications. Using the library, we have also implemented a client-server architecture that allows us to perform interactive intelligent searches on the Web from an applet running on a browser.

Reference-contexts: Both the WebSQL compiler and query engine are implemented as a set of Java <ref> [SM] </ref> classes, which form the WebSQL class library. The library can be used from any Java program. The WebSQL system architecture is depicted in Figure 2. The Compiler and Virtual Machine. The WebSQL compiler parses the query and translates it into a nested loop program in a custom-designed object language.

Reference-contexts: Ellen Spertus argues <ref> [Spe97] </ref> that the information in links can be exploited in several useful ways. For instance, using just syntactic information, one can classify hypertext links within a site as upward in the file hierarchy, downward or crosswise and links to other sites as outward.
