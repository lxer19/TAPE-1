Abstract: The consortium consists of groups for social and market studies: Cardware (GB), Institut fur Sozialforschung (D), software and hardware producers: DigiCash (NL); Gemplus (F); Ingenico (F), Siemens (D), and designers of secure cryptographic protocols: CWI (NL), PTT Research (NL), SEPT (F), Sintef Delab Trondheim (N), Universities of Aarhus (DK), Hildesheim (D), and Leuven (B). An important aspect of CAFE is high security of all parties concerned, with the least possible requirements that they are forced to trust other parties (multi-party security), and less dependence on the tamper-resistance of devices than with other proposals for stored value cards. CAFE proposes an open architecture for small and high value payments, post-pay (like credit cards) or pre-pay (like stored value cards). For small everyday transactions all payments can be made o*ine, and privacy is an important issue. Other features are loss tolerance, different currencies, and an open architecture. The devices used in CAFE are so-called electronic wallets. Two types will be trialed, a simple one with just two buttons and a display and one with more buttons. Advantages of buttons are that PINs can be entered directly, so that fake-terminal attacks are prevented or that certain amounts may be unlocked beforehand to prevent the observation of PIN entry. According to the surveys, enough customers are willing to pay the price of these devices (up to $60), although a large share require them to be very thin to fit in a regular wallet. The protocols could also be run in multi-functional devices like PDAs or mobile phones. The wallets in the trial use smartcards as money storage. In the trial, it is currently possible to use the smartcards without the wallets, too, although this reduces the amount of control the user has over his money. The system could also be used for network payments (electronic marketplaces). Since the wallets simply communicate via infrared, the
