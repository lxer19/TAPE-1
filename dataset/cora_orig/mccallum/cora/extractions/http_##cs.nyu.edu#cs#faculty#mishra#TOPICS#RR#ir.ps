Title: Reactive Algorithms for 2 and 3 Finger Grasping  
Author: Marek Teichmann and Bud Mishra 
Abstract: We study the problem of grasping an unknown 2- 1 2 D object with constant horizontal cross section using three types of robot hands. We consider a three fingered hand, a two fingered hand and a standard parallel jaw gripper and equip these with distance and angle sensors that are located at the fingers or jaws. The sensors used are simple, provide only limited information, but allow us to reactively find a good grasp on an unknown convex object. When grasped the forces applied will be normal to the object boundary. Furthermore the object is not disturbed as the grasping points are being sought.

Reference-contexts: The main basic operation our algorithm will need is the following of the object boundary by a finger. This has already been implemented on various robotic platforms, see for example <ref> [J92] </ref>. 2 Three Finger Reactive Algorithm Our algorithm for finding a three fingered grasp is based on the paradigm of finding a locally minimal area triangle that encloses the object. A geometric algorithm for convex polygons can be found in [OAMB86].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the past, the usual approach to grasping has been to assume an accurate model of the object to be grasped and from such a model, an off-line geometric algorithm determines a set of grip points, where the fingers are then placed. (See Mishra et. al. <ref> [MSS87] </ref> and Mishra and Teichmann [MT92]). Once the grip points have been determined, the geometry of the object is deemed irrelevant.

Here we use the local geometry of the object to find a set of grip points and we also solve the local motion planning problem of getting the fingers to their grasping positions.

Reference-contexts: These sensors can be implemented by using for example an array of distance sensors similar to the optical Okada sensor <ref> [O82] </ref> or rotating the fingers such that some sensor remains normal to the object.

Reference-contexts: In the same spirit, we have developed earlier a reactive algorithm for a modified parallel jaw gripper, where the jaws are wider than the object and are equipped with light beam sensors, see <ref> [TM93] </ref>. Here however we consider three fingered grasping, two fingered grasping and a parallel jaw gripper with jaws that are are narrow compared to the object. <p> This is precisely how the algorithm operates. In essence we minimize a potential function defined by the triangle area, whereas in <ref> [TM93] </ref>, we minimize the distance between the two jaws of the parallel jaw gripper. Given such a triangle, we note that the lines through its edge midpoints and perpendicular to their corresponding edges are concurrent at the point which is the center of the circle circumscribing the triangle.
