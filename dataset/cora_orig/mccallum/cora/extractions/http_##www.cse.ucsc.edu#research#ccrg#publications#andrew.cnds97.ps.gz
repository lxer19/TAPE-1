Abstract: The Group Allocation Multiple Access (GAMA) protocol for scheduling variable-length packet transmissions in a single-hop packet-radio network is specified and analyzed. By maintaining a dynamically-sized cycle that changes in length depending on the amount of network traffic, GAMA is able to provide the advantages of both TDMA and CSMA. Each cycle contains a contention period and a group-transmission period; a station with data to send competes for the right to be added to the transmission group by successfully completing an RTS/CTS message exchange during the contention period. Once a station is a member of the transmission group, it is able to transmit a collision-free data packet during each cycle. As long as a station has data to send, it maintains its position in the group. This can be viewed as either allowing stations to share the floor in an organized manner, or as establishing frames that are not synchronized on a slot-basis and vary their length dynamically based on demand. The throughput and average delay of GAMA are presented and analyzed; to validate our analysis, the results of both models are compared to the throughput and delay produced by a simulation of GAMA.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, polling requires a central station to poll the packet radios, and is efficient only if the majority of the packet radios are busy transmitting. Several approaches have been proposed in the past to combine contention schemes with reservations, token-passing, or polling (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref> [5] [12]). However, relatively few proposals have been reported for fully distributed single-channel packet-radio networks that attempt to provide performance guarantees without polling or time slotting. We describe and analyze a new channel access protocol for single-hop packet-radio networks that we call the Group Allocation Multiple Access protocol (GAMA).

Reference-contexts: An attractive feature of CSMA protocols is that they are simple to implement; however, because each packet must contend for transmission, these and other similar contention-based MAC protocols cannot provide performance guarantees to real-time traffic. We note that even the floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) protocols <ref> [6] </ref>, which permit a station to take over the channel in order to transmit packets without collisions, cannot provide delay guarantees to real-time applications because stations may wait varying times to obtain control of the channel. <p> At some load level, the network becomes unstable, the throughput approaches 0, and the average delay becomes unbounded. Recently, floor acquisition multiple access <ref> [6] </ref> (FAMA) protocols have been proposed to allow for the collision-free transmission of packet trains. FAMA protocols require a successful two-way handshake between sender and receiver before the sender transmits any data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the speed and capacity of wireless networks increase, so does the demand for improved quality of service for real-time multimedia applications that require performance guarantees. In the past, CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) protocols <ref> [9] </ref> have been used in several packet-radio networks. CSMA protocols attempt to prevent a station from transmitting simultaneously with other stations within its transmission range by asking the station to listen before it transmits. <p> Therefore P m can be expressed as, P m = P m1 (10) The average number of group members is = i=1 If multiple RTS packets collide the value of Y represents the length of the overlap between colliding packets. This value as shown in <ref> [9] </ref> can be represented as: Y = t The probability P r that an RTS packet (once sent) is successful is equal to the probability that no other messages arrive within t seconds of the start of transmission, i.e., P r = e t (13) An idle period separates successive cycles;
