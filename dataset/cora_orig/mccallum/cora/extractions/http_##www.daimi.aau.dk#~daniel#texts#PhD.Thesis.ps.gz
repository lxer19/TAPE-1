Reference-contexts: They are fundamental for the intuitionistic reconstruction of the continuum. Of special interest is Brouwer's analysis of the structure of a hypothetical proof that a 6 predicate is a bar. Different presentation of his analysis can be seen for instance in <ref> [Bro54] </ref>, [Dum77] and [MG79]. There are different ways of formulating a statement interpreting Brouwer's analysis. One of them is expressed by the following statement which can also be found under the name of Brouwer's dogma in [MG79].

It is known as bar induction on monotone bars, or simply bar induction, and is explained for instance in <ref> [Dum77] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We rather see the fact that they are intuitionistically equivalent as a motivation to adopt the notion of inductive bar as the type-theoretic representation of the notion of bar. This idea goes back to Martin-Lof <ref> [Mar68] </ref> where a similar inductive definition of the notion of bar is used. In type theory, it makes sense to make this definition generally, that is, for finite sequences of elements of any set rather than restricting it to the set of nat ural numbers.

We will see that bar induction follows from Brouwer's dogma and implies Brouwer's thesis which in turn implies Brouwer's dogma. Brouwer's dogma implies bar induction: To see this we assume Brouwer's dogma, and the premises in the rule of bar induction and prove the conclusion.

Reference-contexts: There are several different proofs of Higman's lemma. Many of them, if not all, use some formulation of Ramsey theorem, usually implicitly. Among those proofs, the one presented here is the shortest and the easiest to show. It is a classical and impredicative argument due to Nash-Williams <ref> [Nas63] </ref>, which is adapted here to make explicit the use of the following version of Ramsey theorem. Ramsey theorem In every infinite graph, either there is an infinite subgraph in which every two vertices are adjacent, or there is an infinite subgraph in which no two vertices are adjacent.

Reference-contexts: An intuitionistic interpretation of it is the following variation of the intuition-istic Ramsey theorem as presented in <ref> [VB93] </ref>. Intuitionistic Ramsey theorem Given two sets A and B, a relation R on A and a relation S on B, if R and S are unavoidable, so is R fi S. The proof that Ramsey theorem implies the intuitionistic version is as follows.

Brouwer's thesis ([Vel81]) If U is a bar then there is a stump oe such that for all v 2 oe maximal, there is an initial segment u of v such that U (u) holds.

Reference-contexts: The answer to this question resides in exploiting the constructive content of the only assumption of Higman's lemma, that S is unavoidable. Veldman <ref> [Vel94] </ref> discovered how to do it in intuitionistic mathematics. The proof in this thesis is an interpretation in type theory of Veldman's proof. As such, it contains implicitly a program which does not use relS and solves Higman's lemma.
