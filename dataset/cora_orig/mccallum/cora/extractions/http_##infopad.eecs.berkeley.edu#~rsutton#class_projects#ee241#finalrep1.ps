Abstract: The final self-timed simulation, shown in A11, has all three model parameters increased by a factor of two (R JA, R JJ , C CAP ). This is the result of variations in package characteristics. Our simulation shows that the temperature controlled variable delay design strategy still provides maximum efficiency set by power dissipation of the given package. We have presented three different techniques to use temperature in controlling the operating speed of digital circuits. It has been shown by simulations that our adaptive methods can be applied to both synchronous and self-timed systems to provide increased reliability, increased tolerance to package power dissipation, and maximal average throughput for a given logic activity distribution and environmental temperature.
