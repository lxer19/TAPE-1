Abstract: The local approximation order from a scale (S h ) of approximating functions on IR m is characterized in terms of the linear spac (and its Fourier transform) of the finitely many compactly supported functions ' whose integer translates '( j), j 2 ZZ m , span the space S = S 1 from which the scale is derived. This provides a correction of similar results stated and proved, in part, by Strang and Fix. If, more generally, c is some function on IR m , we will still just write ' fl c instead of the correct but more complicated ' fl (c ZZ m ). The function u to be approximated lies in the Sobolev space W k kuk p := kuk L p (IR m ) : We denote by W k ' , Strang and Fix [SF, Theorem II] state the following result. In its statement and subsequent analysis, the normalized multivariate monomials appear often enough to deserve an abbreviation of their own. We will use [[ ]] to stand for the function IR m ! IR : x 7! x ff =ff! (and will use standard multi-index notation

Condition (1 ffi ) differs from (i) in that the latter requires, additionally, that P fiff [[ iD]] fi ^ fffi = 0 at 0.

Condition (2 ffi ) is, off-hand, weaker than (ii), but an inductive argument leads from (2 ffi ) to (ii).
