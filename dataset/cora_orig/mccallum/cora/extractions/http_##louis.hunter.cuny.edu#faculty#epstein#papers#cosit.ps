Abstract: This paper appeared in COSIT 97, pp.373-388. Abstract This paper focuses upon features of two-dimensional space that facilitate and/or obstruct travel through it. Three kinds of facilitators and four kinds of ob structers are identified. For each one, learning algorithms and navigational applications are pro posed. The program described here simulates a robot that learns such features as it encoun ters them, and then applies them to subsequent travel decisions. The resulting sys tem travels Pragmatic navigation aspires to provide robust, competent performance in two - dimensional space, performance that improves across time and is resilient to changes in origin and destination. Instead of preengineered expertise for a particular territory, a pragmatic navigator learns its way around a new territory from a series of trips through the territory, trips whose origins and destinations differ. Instead of a detailed map, pragmatic navigation relies upon fea tures that support efficient travel or make it more difficult, such as a door into a room or an extended wall. In a new territory, a pragmatic navigator initially performs as a competent novice, and then, as it learns features of the territory from traveling there, it uses that knowledge to im prove its performance. As envisioned here, most fea tures are heuristic, that is, useful approximations that describe a territory and travel experi ence through it. Such representation deliberately sacri fices detail in exchange for effi cient storage, retrieval, and computation. This paper describes the rep resentation and reasoning that underlie Ariadne, a program for pragmatic navigation. (Ariadne, daugh ter of King Minos of Crete, told Theseus how to find his way through the labyrinth that protected a great treasure.) Instead of a map, Ariadne learns two kinds of features to describe a territory: those that support efficient travel (facilitators ) and those make it more difficult (obstructers). The first section describes these features, and the second de scribes how that representation is harnessed to reason about travel through grid worlds. Subse - quent sections analyze the source of the programs power, consider its cognitive plausibility, and discuss related work. pragmatically through a variety of two-dimensional worlds.

Reference-contexts: Ariadne does demonstrate, however, how expertise can be developed rapidly by a navigator with limited sensors. Other learning methods have been applied only to mazes far easier than those Ariadne works in: temporal difference [16], case-based planning <ref> [1] </ref> , and a connectionist model that integrates path finding into general cognition [2]. Hayes has constructed a rigorous approach to reasoning about space, as yet unimplemented [11]. TOUR [12] and Qualnav [13] have land marks that are sensorily distinctive, features that this work has yet to incorporate.

Reference-contexts: There is no claim here that Ariadne is a cognitive model of a human navigator, only that many of its features are cognitively plausible. Bases are reminiscent of landmarks, although for their spatial, rather than their visual, properties. Several of the Advisors do model principles of naive geographic reasoning <ref> [3] </ref> all of us readily recognize: Plods tentativeness, Adventures curiosity, and Hurrys anxiety. In addition, cognitive scientists have found evidence for Contracts rationale [9] and the rationales of several of the other Advisors [10]. There have, however, been no tests of human subjects on prob lems as difficult as these. <p> Ariadnes reliance upon multiple representations and its tolerance for inconsistent and even in correct information, geographers tell us, is much like the naive geography that people rely on <ref> [3] </ref>. Even the use of levels (number of turns) for degree of problem difficulty is supported by results that people gauge distance that way [15]. The spatial representation postulated here supports performance in the more realistic environments of Section 3.2, and is readily adapted further.

FORR approaches problem solving as a sequence of reasonable decisions based on the cur rent state of the world and learned useful knowledge. Ariadne is a FORR-based system for pragmatic navigation.

Indeed, psychologists doubt that most people with the same visual limitations as Ariadnes robot could solve problems on this scale much above level 4 (personal communication, Ratterman).

These representations systematically distort visual perception to facilitate recall [18].
