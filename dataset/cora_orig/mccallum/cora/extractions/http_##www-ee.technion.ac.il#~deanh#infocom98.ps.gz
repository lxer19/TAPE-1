Abstract: This work considers the problem of routing connections with QoS requirements across networks, when the information available for making routing decisions is inaccurate. This uncertainty about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a number of different environments, which are reviewed in the paper. The goal of the route selection process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the QoS requirements. For end-to-end delay guarantees, this problem is intractable. However, we show that by decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local delay constraints, efficient and tractable solutions can be established. We first consider the simpler problem of decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local constraints, for a given path. We show that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable. Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions, which posses a certain convexity property, and restricting ourselves to that class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions. Moreover, we show that typical distributions would belong to that class. We then consider the general problem, of combined path optimization and delay decomposition. We present an efficient solution scheme for the above class of probability distributions. Our solution is similar to that of the restricted shortest-path problem, which renders itself to near-optimal approximations of polynomial complexity. We also show that yet simpler solutions exist in the special case of uniform distributions.

Reference-contexts: For instance, if k links have p 0 as their probability of success then we must have p 0 k p p min . Most shortest path problems (and consequently their corresponding algorithms) have an optimal sub-structure property <ref> [1] </ref>: a shortest path between two vertices contains within it other shortest paths. This property is a hallmark of the applicability of both dynamic-programming and greedy methods. <p> Due to space limits, in this version we just outline the results, and the reader is referred to [8] for the full details. Problem OP can be shown to be NP hard, through a reduction to the 0-1 knapsack problem <ref> [1] </ref>. However, in the following we shall show that, by restricting ourselves to a certain class of distributions, exact and efficient solutions can be obtained. First, we define a family of probability distributions for which we can present efficient solutions. This family consists of distributions with a certain convexity property.

Reference-contexts: This is especially true if we try to solve Problem OP-MP with a predefined (non-optimal) solution of Problem OP. For instance, partitioning the delay with equal probabilities for all links allows us to use standard shortest path solutions, as shown in <ref> [5] </ref>. III. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM OP In this section we explore Problem OP, and establish an efficient solution for a wide class of probability distributions. Due to space limits, in this version we just outline the results, and the reader is referred to [8] for the full details.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we established an O 2 solution for the case of uniform distributions. For Problem RSP, there are fully polynomial approximation schemes (FPAS), e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>, which are derived from the dynamic programming, exact (pseudo-polynomial) solution. Recently, we have been able to construct a similar FPAS scheme, that can be employed, to get fully polynomial and near-optimal solutions for Problem OP-MP.

Reference-contexts: III. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM OP In this section we explore Problem OP, and establish an efficient solution for a wide class of probability distributions. Due to space limits, in this version we just outline the results, and the reader is referred to <ref> [8] </ref> for the full details. Problem OP can be shown to be NP hard, through a reduction to the 0-1 knapsack problem [1]. However, in the following we shall show that, by restricting ourselves to a certain class of distributions, exact and efficient solutions can be obtained. <p> One such distribution is the uniform, which we proceed to discuss. A. Uniform Distribution It can be verified that uniform distributions belong to . Next, we show that we can get an implicit expression for the optimal 3 See <ref> [8] </ref> for a more detailed discussion. partition D p (ff). <p> B. Who belongs to ? includes all probability distributions with convex cost functions c (d). In <ref> [8] </ref> we investigate to what extend the assumption f l 2 limits the choice of f l . We proceed to outline the main conclusions. It is important to note that the assumption is needed only in the region (t l ; D). <p> A probability distribution is concave if its density function is monotonic decreasing. This is true for many distributions if p 0 is big enough. For instance, the exponential distribution is concave for any choice of p 0 , and the normal distribution is concave for p 0 0:5. In <ref> [8] </ref>, we show that the uniform distribution also belongs to , and observe that, typically, the considered distributions can be expected to belong to , in the relevant region. IV. <p> Thus, the complexity is O (D jEj) : 4 For all existing C (n; u; v). A. Application to Problem OP-MP Observe that Problem OP-MP is also NP-hard. This can be proved by a straightforward reduction to Problem RSP. For a formal proof, see <ref> [8] </ref>. The crucial difference between Problem RSP and Problem OP-MP is that we do not have a single pair (d l ; c l ) for each link l = (u; v). Rather, we have a complete function f l (d l ).
