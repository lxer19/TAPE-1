Title: Reconstructing Complex Surfaces from Multiple Stereo Views  
Author: P. Fua

Abstract: We present a framework for 3-D surface reconstruction that can be used to model fully 3-D scenes from an arbitrary number of stereo views taken from vastly different viewpoints. This is a key step toward producing 3-D world-descriptions of complex scenes using stereo and is a very challenging problem: real-world scenes tend to contain many 3-D objects, they do not usually conform to the 2-1/2-D assumption made by traditional algorithms, and one cannot take it for granted that the computed 3-D points can easily be clustered into separate groups. Furthermore, stereo data is often incomplete and sometimes erroneous, which makes the problem even more difficult. By combining a particle-based representation, robust fitting, and optimization of an image-based objective function, we have been able to reconstruct surfaces without any a priori knowledge of their topology and in spite of the noisiness of the stereo data. Our current implementation goes through three steps|initializing a set of particles from the input 3-D data, optimizing their location, and finally grouping them into global surfaces. Using several complex scenes containing multiple objects, we demonstrate its competence and ability to merge information and thus to go beyond what can be done with conventional stereo alone.

Reference-contexts: For comparison's sake, a Lorentzian influence function, scaled so as to have the same maximum, is shown as a dashed line. Because of the noisiness of the input data, a robust surface-fitting method is essential. In this implementation, we use a variant of the Iterative Reweighted Least Squares <ref> [ Beaton and Turkey, 1974 ] </ref> technique, as illustrated by of the form X 1in 4 where the w i are weights. At the first iteration the w i are all taken to be equal to one so that the first fit, f 0 , is a regular least-squares fit.

Reference-contexts: In effect, we use the median distance of the points to the fitted surface as an estimate of the noise variance, and we discount the influence of points that are more than a few standard deviations away. This approach can be related to the use of Lorentzian estimators <ref> [ Black and Rangarajan, 1994 ] </ref> because the influence function of the data points, shown in Figure 2 (c), has roughly the same shape. However, it requires no a priori estimate of the variance of the noise and involves only least-squares, and therefore fast, minimization. <p> In practice we implement the concept of breakable springs by taking f to be f (x) = log (1 + x=s) with s being a fixed constant so that, as in Section 3.2, the interaction forces have a Lorentzian behavior <ref> [ Black and Rangarajan, 1994 ] </ref> . As the particles move out of alignment, the strength of the interaction increases up to a point after which the interaction strength decreases and eventually vanishes.

Reference-contexts: Errors and imprecisions in the original 3-D input data can jeopardize irretrievably the quality of the reconstruction. In previous work, we began addressing this issue by developing an approach to 3-D surface reconstruction that uses image cues while recovering the surface's shape <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994a, Fua and Leclerc, 1994b ] </ref> . It uses an object-centered representation|specifically a 3-D triangulated mesh|and can take advantage of both monocular shading cues and stereoscopic cues from any number of images to refine the model while correctly handling self-occlusions. <p> For each disk-shaped particle, we define a "multi-image intensity correlation" term by projecting the 3-D disks into 2-D elliptical patches in each image and measuring how well these patches correlate. This term is similar to the one we defined in previous work for 3-D triangular facets <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994a ] </ref> . It is a function of the three degrees of freedom of each particle and can therefore be used to perform optimization. <p> The above definition of 2 (x) does not take into account occlusions of the surface: not all sample points of all particles are visible in all images. In theory, this could be handled by generalizing the Z-buffering technique we used in previous work <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994a ] </ref> . However, in the current implementation we use a simpler heuristic. As discussed in Section 3.2, the particles are initialized by computing disparity maps using pairs or triplets of images and fitting local surfaces to the corresponding 3-D points.

In general, E St , the image-correlation term, is not convex and conjugate gradient may not find a global minimum.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the images are monochrome and registered so that their relative camera models are known a priori. Since we are interested in 2 reconstructing surfaces, we start the process by using a simple correlation-based algorithm <ref> [ Fua, 1993 ] </ref> to compute a disparity map for each pair or triplet and by turning each valid disparity value into a 3-D point. If other sources of range data were available, they could be used in a similar fashion. <p> Note that the disparities around the occluding contour on both the left and right sides of the head are erroneous. (d,e,f) The left images of three other stereo pairs of the same person taken from different viewpoints. We ran our correlation-based algorithm <ref> [ Fua, 1993 ] </ref> |once for each consecutive pair of images in the sequence| stored the resulting 3-D points in a 80x80x80 set of voxels and instantiated particles in all voxels containing at least 200 points. The results are shown in the first row of Figure 9.

Reference-contexts: The Root Mean Square distance is 0.19 meter, which corresponds to an error in measured disparity that is smaller than half a pixel. Given the fact that the control points are not necessarily perfect themselves, this is the kind of performance one would expect of a precise stereo system <ref> [ Guelch, 1988 ] </ref> . <p> Note all the spurious points "floating" above the actual objects. For comparison's sake, we have verified that another correlation algorithm [ Hannah, 1988 ] , which is more sophisticated and is considered as one of the best ones currently available <ref> [ Guelch, 1988 ] </ref> , yields similar results. In fact, no setting of its parameters can effectively eliminate these points without also eliminating many of the real 14 (a) (b) (c) on a turntable. (c) Corresponding disparity map.
