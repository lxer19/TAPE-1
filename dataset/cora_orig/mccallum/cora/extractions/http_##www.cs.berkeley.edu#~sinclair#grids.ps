Reference-contexts: Hammersley [13] proved the lower bound 0:418347 , while the early paper by Fowler and Rushbrooke [8] showed the upper bound 0:54931. It has been conjectured that lies between 0:43 and 0:45 . In other work, Bhattacharjee et al <ref> [1] </ref> studied the phase transition behavior of the three-dimensional model. Notwithstanding these efforts, no reliable method is known for computing f (n) to good accuracy. A similar lack of rigorous results holds for the problem at dimer densities less than 1, even in two dimensions. <p> To make the behavior of the algorithm precise, for a fixed dimension d, let f (n; s) denote the number of coverings of the d -dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> d (with periodic boundary conditions) by s dimers and n d 2s monomers. Definition. <p> Clearly, matchings of cardinality s correspond precisely to monomer-dimer arrangements in G with s dimers and 2 (m s) monomers. The classical monomer-dimer problem discussed in the previous two subsections is the special case in which G is the d -dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> d for some d . <p> Our main technical contribution in this paper is to prove that the ratio ff (G) is small for lattices and, more generally, for any family of graphs with sufficiently strong symmetry properties. Specifically, we show that if G is the d-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> d with periodic boundary conditions (so that m = 1 2 n d ), then ff (G) m 2 = 1 4 n 2d . <p> Thus, we consider the d-dimensional rectangular (or cartesian) lattice L (n; d) , where the vertices are the n d integer lattice points in <ref> [1; n] </ref> d , and two points x; y are connected by an edge iff they are unit distance apart. <p> We extend this map to matchings in the natural way: if N is a matching in L (n; 2) , then t (N ) is the matching in [2; n + 1] fi <ref> [1; n] </ref> defined by (t (x); t (y)) 2 t (N ) iff (x; y) 2 N . Let M and N be the sets of perfect and near-perfect matchings respectively in the lattice L (n; 2) .

Reference-contexts: The monomer-dimer problem gained prominence in 1937 through the early paper of Fowler and Rushbrooke [8].

Reference-contexts: We stress that our Monte Carlo algorithm differs from earlier ones for monomer-dimer systems (see, e.g., <ref> [14] </ref>), and indeed for many other problems in statistical physics, in that it is guaranteed (independent of any heuristic arguments) to provide statistically reliable estimates in a running time that grows only polynomially with the number of lattice sites.

Reference-contexts: important here: Elser [5] has solved the dimer covering problem on a hexagonal lattice with fixed boundaries, and shown that the result depends significantly on the shape of the boundary. 4 1.3 Techniques The algorithms mentioned above are all based on a Monte Carlo procedure due to Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [20, 38] </ref>, originally inspired by the approach of Broder [3], for approximating the number of matchings in a graph. A matching in a 2m-vertex graph G = (V; E) is any subset M of the edge set E such that no two edges in M have a common endpoint. <p> We define the quantity ff (G) to be the ratio of the number of near-perfect matchings to the number of perfect matchings in G (assuming the latter is nonzero). An application of the Monte Carlo procedure of Jerrum and Sinclair yields the following result. Theorem 1 (Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [20, Theorem 5.3] </ref>) There exists a fpras for the number of matchings of any cardinality in any family of 2m-vertex graphs G that satisfies ff (G) q (m) , for a fixed polynomial q . <p> The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1.4, for the sake of completeness, we sketch the Monte Carlo algorithm of <ref> [20] </ref> upon which this paper is based. <p> Finally, in Section 4 we conclude with some further remarks on the physical and combinatorial significance of the ratio ff (G), together with some open problems. 1.4 Overview of the algorithm This subsection is devoted to a sketch of the Monte Carlo algorithm of Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [20] </ref>, which counts monomer-dimer coverings in any family of graphs G for which ff (G) is small. This material is not essential to the technical development of the paper, but is included for the benefit of the reader interested in the background to Theorem 1. <p> In what follows, when G is understood we shall suppress the subscript and write Z in place of Z G . The Monte Carlo method described in <ref> [20, Section 4] </ref> simulates a Metropolis-style Markov 7 chain whose state space is the set of matchings in G and whose equilibrium distribution is (M ) = Z () Thus the equilibrium probability of a matching M is proportional to its weight, and the normalizing factor is the partition function. <p> The value = b is chosen so as to ensure that the proportion we are trying to estimate is not prohibitively small: that this is always possible follows from the fact that the coefficients a s are log-concave, i.e., a s1 a s+1 a 2 s <ref> [17, 20] </ref>. <p> For the details, see [22, Section 4] (or <ref> [20, Section 5] </ref> for an alternative, slightly less efficient approach). <p> To quantify this, one must prove a good a priori bound on the relaxation time, or mixing time of the chain, which is a challenging task. This was done in <ref> [20, 38] </ref>, where the mixing time was shown to be a polynomial function of m and the parameter , specifically e O ( 0 4 mjEj 2 ) , where 0 = maxf; 1g .

Reference-contexts: Monte Carlo algorithms with this property have recently been devised for various other problems, such as the Ising model <ref> [21] </ref> and the ice model [32]. In all cases, the key to the analysis is to prove a good bound on the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the Markov chain being simulated (often called the relaxation time, or mixing time, of the chain).

For any graph G , we will denote by M the set of perfect matchings in G and by N the set of near-perfect matchings (monomer-dimer coverings with exactly two monomers). <p> We are also grateful to Mike Luby and Jim Propp, and especially to Stu Whittington, for helpful comments on the ideas presented here, and to Peter Cameron and Dominic Welsh for pointing out reference <ref> [31] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Monte Carlo algorithms with this property have recently been devised for various other problems, such as the Ising model [21] and the ice model <ref> [32] </ref>. In all cases, the key to the analysis is to prove a good bound on the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the Markov chain being simulated (often called the relaxation time, or mixing time, of the chain).

Reference-contexts: This question is also of considerable combinatorial interest, since counting perfect matchings (dimer coverings) in a bipartite graph is equivalent to computing the permanent of a 0-1 matrix <ref> [33] </ref>. This is a widely studied problem in combinatorics for which the existence of an efficient approximation algorithm is an important open question in the theory of computation [40].

Reference-contexts: The Monte Carlo algorithm sketched above runs in polynomial time for a wider class of graphs than any other currently known algorithm, so it is of interest to establish precisely which graphs are amenable to it. (For other simpler, but apparently less widely applicable approximation algorithms, see [25, 19] and <ref> [35] </ref>.) Moreover, it is conceivable that any graph G for which ff (G) is large can be efficiently decomposed in such 22 a way that the resulting components have a small value of ff, and hence fall within the scope of the Monte Carlo algorithm; this idea was used in [23]

Reference-contexts: The three-dimensional problem occurs classically in the theory of mixtures of molecules of different sizes [11] and the cell-cluster theory of the liquid state [4]. In two dimensions, the problem serves as a model for the adsorption of diatomic molecules on a crystal surface <ref> [36] </ref>. (In this last example, `monomers' correspond to empty sites.) Most thermodynamic properties of the system can be deduced from knowledge of the number of ways of covering the lattice with given numbers of monomers and dimers.

Reference-contexts: important here: Elser [5] has solved the dimer covering problem on a hexagonal lattice with fixed boundaries, and shown that the result depends significantly on the shape of the boundary. 4 1.3 Techniques The algorithms mentioned above are all based on a Monte Carlo procedure due to Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [20, 38] </ref>, originally inspired by the approach of Broder [3], for approximating the number of matchings in a graph. A matching in a 2m-vertex graph G = (V; E) is any subset M of the edge set E such that no two edges in M have a common endpoint. <p> For recent surveys of the analytical technology developed for estimating mixing rates of Markov chains, see, e.g., <ref> [22, 24, 38] </ref>. Our proofs of the above bound for lattices and general vertex-transitive graphs, presented in the next two sections, are elementary and construct explicit injections from pairs of near-perfect matchings to pairs of perfect matchings. <p> To quantify this, one must prove a good a priori bound on the relaxation time, or mixing time of the chain, which is a challenging task. This was done in <ref> [20, 38] </ref>, where the mixing time was shown to be a polynomial function of m and the parameter , specifically e O ( 0 4 mjEj 2 ) , where 0 = maxf; 1g .

Reference-contexts: The monomer-dimer problem gained prominence in 1937 through the early paper of Fowler and Rushbrooke [8]. A breakthrough was achieved in 1961, when, independently, Fisher, Kaste-leyn and Temperley provided an analytic solution for the case of dimer coverings (i.e., arrangements with dimer density 1) on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [6, 27, 39] </ref>. The key idea is to express the number of dimer coverings as a Pfaffian, which in turn can be evaluated as the square root of an associated determinant.
