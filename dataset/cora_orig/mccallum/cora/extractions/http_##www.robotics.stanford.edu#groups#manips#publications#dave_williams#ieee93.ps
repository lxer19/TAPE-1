Title: The Virtual Linkage: A Model for Internal Forces in Multi-Grasp Manipulation

Abstract: We propose a model to characterize internal forces and moments during multi-grasp manipulation. The proposed approach is based on construction of a physical model, called the virtual linkage, which is a closed chain mechanism that represents the object being manipulated. Forces and moments applied at the grasp points of this linkage cause joint forces and torques at its actuators. When these actuators are subjected to the opposing forces and torques, the virtual linkage becomes a locked structure. Internal forces in the object are then characterized by these forces and torques. This approach was used in a multi-arm robot system to manipulate objects while performing accurate control of internal forces.

Reference-contexts: To date, research dealing with internal forces and moments has focused essentially on two tasks; minimizing internal forces during manipulation [6], or determining a set of grasp forces that satisfy frictional and stability constraints for point contact without applying excessive force to the manipulated object <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Typically these approaches establish the relationship between the forces applied to an object and the resultant of these forces at some reference point. They then proceed to solve this relationship using a generalized inverse.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been a great deal of interest in the control of internal forces for both multi-finger <ref> [3, 5, 7] </ref> and multi-arm [8, 9] robotic systems. For multiple arm coordination, internal force control is often used to compensate for kinematic errors and dynamic interaction forces. In grasping, internal forces are controlled in such a way as to satisfy friction constraints and prevent slip.
