Abstract: We calculate bounds on per-lane Automated Highway System (AHS) capacity as a function of vehicle capabilities and control system information structure. We assume that the AHS lane is dedicated for use by fully automated vehicles. Capacity is constrained by the minimum inter-vehicle separation necessary for safe operation. A methodology for deriving the safe minimum inter-vehicle separation for a particular safety criterion is presented. The inter-vehicle separation, which depends on the vehicle braking capability, control loop delays and operating speed, is then used to compute site-independent upper bounds on AHS capacity for a given mix of vehicle classes. The sensitivity of the capacity with respect to the degree of inter-vehicle cooperation, check-in policies (governing minimum acceptable vehicle-braking capabil ity), highway speed limits, and lane-use policies (governing the sharing of a lane by multi ple vehicle class es) is also investigated.

Reference-contexts: We estimate the maximum possible steady state flow in vehicles per lane per hour through such an AHS pipe for various AHS operating speeds. The flow through an actual AHS lane will always be less than our steady-state estimate due to transient <ref> [3, 16] </ref> effects such as lane changing, demand, etc.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical justification for this safety criterion is given in Section 2. Vehicles following the separation policy dictated by the hard braking safety criterion are referred to as individual vehicles. It can be shown <ref> [4] </ref> that this safety criterion results in significant reduction of the probability of inter-vehicle rear-end collisions compared to current highway driving. <p> It is conjectured that, because of the tight intra-platoon spacing, all resulting intra-platoon collisions will satisfy low relative velocity safety criterion. Although, it is shown <ref> [4] </ref> that in a hard braking emergency scenario the first intra-platoon collision will satisfy low impact velocity safety criterion, further research is required to verify this property for subsequent intra-platoon collisions. <p> The analysis stresses the importance of inter-vehicle coordination and knowledge of a vehicles braking capability. Three distinct levels of capacity emerge for different AHS designs. An individual vehicle AHS with uniform spacing produces comparable pipeline capacity to manual traffic (although with improved safety <ref> [4] </ref>). An individual vehicle AHS with online estimation of the vehicles braking capability can produce substantially higher capacities. This suggests the need for research in the area of online estimation of braking capability. <p> In the case of platooning, intra-platoon collisions may result from hard uncoordinated braking in case of (i) mismatch between the braking capabilities of the followers and/or (ii) control loop lags. Collisions can arise in the case of inconsistent pavement (e.g. oil spills or ice patches). The safety analysis in <ref> [4] </ref> shows that in the case of a two vehicle platoon, such intra-platoon collisions will be of low severity (impact velocity less than 3m/s). There is 25 some work on the multiple collisions for larger platoons ([8],[20]).

Reference-contexts: Our analysis also requires the maximum braking rates for the three vehicle classes. Maximum braking rates for 1995 models for new light-duty passen ger vehicles on dry road surfaces are used as a starting point to create a braking capability distribution <ref> [5] </ref>. We use data reported in Road and Track for the braking capabilities of specialty vehicles, while relying on data reported in Consumer Reports for all other types of light-duty passenger vehi cles.

Reference-contexts: It will be used in Section 3 to derive safe spacing requirements, and thereby pipeline capacity for individual vehicles and inter-platoon operation. 2.2 Spacing Requirements for Platoons The state of the art longitudinal control laws proposed for intra-platoon operation <ref> [6] </ref> are significantly different from those for individual vehicles. The intra-platoon control laws can regulate spacing with very high precision but require additional information not available through sensors (such as the deceleration of the vehicle ahead and the deceleration of the leader of the platoon). <p> Therefore a high level of inter-vehicle cooperation is needed within a platoon. Moreover, the laws of <ref> [6] </ref> require larger and larger control inputs the further back a vehicle is in the platoon (see Figure 2). This implies that if the leader brakes at the rate a A min and some follower cannot brake harder than a A min intra-platoon collisions may be possible. <p> To avoid such collisions we define the platoon brake amplification factor, a , as: a = maximum peak braking by any follower / lead vehicle peak braking. This quantity depends on the design of the intra-platoon controller. For our analysis we pick a well-known, experimentally verified control law from <ref> [6] </ref> and compute a for it using MATLAB simulations. For the chosen law it can be analytically shown [6] that a is independent of the magnitude of lead vehicle braking and that the braking effort stops growing after the first few followers. <p> This quantity depends on the design of the intra-platoon controller.

For the chosen law it can be analytically shown [6] that a is independent of the magnitude of lead vehicle braking and that the braking effort stops growing after the first few followers. Figure 2 provides the data necessary to derive a . <p> We therefore require that platoon A satisfies the hard braking safety requirement assuming that leader of platoon A can decelerate at a rate a A min platoon B can decelerate at a rate a B min Based on the controllers of <ref> [6] </ref> we can also compute a bound on the intra-platoon spacing needed for safety. The goal of the intra-platoon control law considered above is to maintain constant spacing between adjacent followers. It can be shown [6] that this control law is string stable, i.e., all vehicles eventually converge to their desired <p> platoon B can decelerate at a rate a B min Based on the controllers of <ref> [6] </ref> we can also compute a bound on the intra-platoon spacing needed for safety. The goal of the intra-platoon control law considered above is to maintain constant spacing between adjacent followers. It can be shown [6] that this control law is string stable, i.e., all vehicles eventually converge to their desired spacing and the maximum of the spacing errors over time decreases as we move further back in 7 the platoon (see Figure 3). <p> The tool simulates the response of the vehicles in a platoon to a hard braking disturbance generated by the lead vehicle. Each vehicle in the platoon applies the control law developed in <ref> [6] </ref> to satisfy string stability requirements. The simulation results confirm that if the maximum braking of the platoon leader is limited by the application of the derating factor a to the worst braking capability within a platoon, there will be no intra-platoon collisions.

Reference-contexts: The candidate saddle solution simply requires both vehicles A and B to brake as hard as possible. In can be shown that: Lemma ( ) u d * * , is globally a saddle solution for cost ( ) J x u d 0 , , . Refer to <ref> [9] </ref> for further details regarding the game theoretic formulation and computation of the saddle solution for the vehicle following problem. This lemma can be used to calculate the optimum cost ( ) J x * 0 for a given initial condition x 0 . <p> The spacings were used to calculate an upper bound on the per-lane capacity of an automated highway system over a range of operating speeds. The spacing design is also useful for obtaining safe operating parameters for lane change, entry and exit maneuvers <ref> [9, 19] </ref>. The resulting inter-vehicle spacing values form the basis for the estimation of AHS throughput [2,3,21]. For the modeling assumptions and range of parameter values used in this analysis, one can conclude the following: AHS pipeline capacity increases as the degree of inter-vehicle cooperation increases. <p> Findings from such analyses may indicate that the capacity analyses need to be revised. The methods used in this paper can also be applied to spacing design criteria that incorporate secondary collisions (see <ref> [9] </ref>). The estimation of actual throughput is also an interesting topic of research. The pipeline capacity is unlikely to be realized by an AHS lane due to transient behaviors such as lane changes, entry, exit, platoon formation and dissipation.

Reference-contexts: This will not always be the case, however, due to errors in desired speed tracking. To make our results more realistic, we introduce some uncertainty in the relative velocity. We assume that the maximum value of speed tracking error during normal operation is 1.5 percent <ref> [13] </ref> and assume, that the following vehicle travels 1.5 percent faster than the preceding vehicle in the spacing design. Finally, the spacing between two individ ual vehicles and between two platoons is calculated in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 using the hard braking safety criterion.

Reference-contexts: The capacity calculations require nominal values for the various system parameters: lags, deceleration capabilities, jerk limits, vehicle lengths, etc. Sensitivity of the capacity with respect to variations about the nominal values will be investigated for some of the parameters. The interested reader can find further details in <ref> [14] </ref>. For the vehicle class percentages, we will use a typical urban highway mix of 93% light duty passenger vehicles (LDPV), 6% trucks and 1% buses. The vehicle lengths are assumed to be 5m, 12m and 20m for passenger vehicles, buses and trucks respectively. <p> The peak occurs at higher speeds for platoons than for individual vehicles. These conclusions hold even if the lags and nominal braking capabilities are varied about the nominal values. Further details may be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. lags on pipeline capacity. The plot is for the case of low cooperative individual vehicles in a highway populated entirely by LDPV. The pipeline ca pacity changes approximately five percent between the lowest and highest lags, indicating low sensitivity of pipeline capacity to lags. <p> For 16 individual vehicles there is a decline in pipeline capacity between 15% and 16% as the ratio of trucks in creases from zero to 10 percent. These observations are also confirmed for low cooperative and autonomous vehicles and for speeds between 5 and 40 m/s (see <ref> [14] </ref>). In Summary, the results indicate that the pipeline capacity is very sensitive to the proportion of heavy vehicles in the AHS vehicle population . <p> The nominal platoon sizes for pas senger vehicles, buses, and trucks are ten, three, and two, respectively. The results for LDPV and 17 buses are shown in Figures 9 and 10. Pipeline capacity decreases as the intra-platoon spacing increases. The truck case behaves similarly (see <ref> [14] </ref>). 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2000 4000 6000 8000 Speed (m/s) P e e a a i t y h / h Platoons of light-duty passenger vehicles, intra-platoon spacing = 2m Platoon length = 1 veh Platoon length = 10 veh 5 10 15 20 25 30 <p> The results for the autonomous and low-cooperative vehicle cases are similar (see <ref> [14] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The second safety criterion considered here is the low relative velocity safety criterion, which requires that: If a vehicle applies maximum braking and the following vehicle collides with it, the relative velocity at initial impact should be small. Theoretical justification for this safety criterion is given in <ref> [17] </ref>. For a discussion on tolerable relative velocities at impact see [18]. Assuming that initially the speed of both vehicles is the same, it can be shown [17] that the low relative velocity safety criterion can be met if the vehicles are either far apart or close enough to one another. <p> Theoretical justification for this safety criterion is given in <ref> [17] </ref>.
