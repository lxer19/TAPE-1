Reference-contexts: Introduction There is a hard problem in the theory of the noetherian rings, the computation of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of modules. This problem has been solved in <ref> [BCJ96] </ref> for universal enveloping algebras of finite-dimensional Lie algebras. In this note we provide a effective method based in the computation of a Grobner basis of a (left, right, twosided) ideal which works in quantum groups. A quantum group is usually a finitely generated algebra over a commutative field |. <p> We can apply the previous results to the followings examples. Examples 3.8 The classical examples are A n (|), the n-Weyl algebra, and U (g), the universal enveloping algebras. These were treated in <ref> [BCJ96] </ref>, and they are also examples of PBW algebras with respect to the graded lexico graphic order. 8 Example 3.9 Let us compute the Gelkand-Kirillow dimension in a concrete (non-classic) example.

Reference-contexts: These algebras are called polynomial rings of solvable type in <ref> [KRW90] </ref>. Given an admissible order `' in N p , and a |-basis B = fX ff : ff 2 N p g; we fix the following notation. Let f 2 R, f 6= 0. <p> We use the notation introduced in the foregoing section. At this point, the basic result is the (strong) left division algorithm, which allows us to get different proofs of results in <ref> [KRW90] </ref>. <p> Following <ref> [KRW90] </ref>, we are going to note I ` (F ) the left ideal generated by F , I r (F ) the right ideal, and I (F ) the twosided ideal. <p> Let us begin now with a twosided ideal. Remember that if I is a twosided ideal, a Grobner basis for I is a set fg 1 ; : : : ; g t g I such that Exp (I) = i=1 Following <ref> [KRW90] </ref> we can obtain a Grobner basis for a twosided ideal. 6 Lemma 2.12 ([KRW90, Lemma 5.1]) Let F R finite where R is a PBW algebra. The following assertions are equivalent: 1. I r (F ) I ` (F ). 3.

Reference-contexts: Then dim | (F n M ) = cardfff 2 N p n Exp (I) ; jffj ng As a consequence of the previous result, the Hilbert function of the monoideal Exp (I) is the Hilbert function of the module R=I as defined in <ref> [MR88] </ref>. So, if we want to check the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of R=I we have to check the growth of the Hilbert function of Exp (I). The next theorem proves that this growth is polynomial and checks it. Theorem 3.7 Let `' be a graded admissible order on N p .

Reference-contexts: A quantum group is usually a finitely generated algebra over a commutative field |. There is a good introduction of this topics in <ref> [Smi92] </ref>. <p> Examples 1.4 The easiest noncommutative example is the quantum plane C q [X; Y ] (see e.g. <ref> [Smi92] </ref>) with basis B = fX i Y j ; (i; j) 2 N 2 g. The usual graded lexicographic order in N 2 is B-admissible. More generally, consider O q (C n ) the quantum coordinate ring of the n th complex affine space (see again [Smi92]). <p> ] (see e.g. <ref> [Smi92] </ref>) with basis B = fX i Y j ; (i; j) 2 N 2 g. The usual graded lexicographic order in N 2 is B-admissible. More generally, consider O q (C n ) the quantum coordinate ring of the n th complex affine space (see again [Smi92]). In this case, the basis B is similar to the standard basis of the commutative polynomial ring and the graded lexicographic order is B-admissible. A classical example is the enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field, where the basis is given by the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem.
