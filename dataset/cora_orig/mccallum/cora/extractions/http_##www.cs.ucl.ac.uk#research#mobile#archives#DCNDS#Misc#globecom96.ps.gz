Abstract: An optical network architecture suitable for interconnecting base stations in a distributed microcellular wireless communications system is proposed. Base stations are grouped into one-hop subnets of size m each and connected by mxm star couplers. Each base station is affiliated with several subnets and has a tunable optical tranceiver(s) over m distinct wavelength channels. The network can support N = m D base stations, where D is the network diameter (typically 2, 3). The multicast nature of the architecture lends itself to fast routing and mobility control schemes supporting point to multipoint connections. The network architecture composed of a wired and a wireless segments, and corresponding addressing and routing schemes are described. The network is highly fault-tolerant, has a self-routing method and a near balanced load which results in high throughput and low delay. These features are discussed together with examples.

Reference-contexts: The tunable tranceiver is composed of a tunable transmitter or a tunable receiver or both. Note that the m wavelengths are reused in every subnet. In each sub-net the m base stations can use one of several known WDMA protocols described in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1.1 Construction It is relatively simple to construct the Star-Base. It is shown by the following example how to construct a network beginning with the lowest order network (a single-hop m-node 1 network) and going up.

Reference-contexts: This paper is concerned with finding an efficient backbone network architecture connecting base stations which is suitable for next generation mobile wireless networks supporting point to multipoint connections. The ar chitecture utilizes recent advances in optical networking technology [2],[3] emphasizing recent interest concerning efficient topologies composed of multiple stars <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]. We consider a microcellular distributed network of base stations to which mobiles are connected via wideband radio links. An example of an application using this type of networks is file transfer between two portable computers located within a building or a campus of buildings.

Reference-contexts: In general, a SB (m; D) network is constructed from m copies of a SB (m,D-1) network by connecting the base stations with the same labels through a common star. 3.1.2 Complexity Define the complexity of the network as a count of basic active switching elements <ref> [6] </ref> and assume that each node has D tran-ceivers one for each subnet it is affiliated with. Further assume that each tranceiver is composed of a fixed-tuned transmitter (tuned to a specific wavelength) and a tunable receiver (over m distinct wavelengths). <p> Note that by definition passive elements (e.g., star couplers) are not included in the complexity since active elements usually dominate the cost of a given system. Following the argument in <ref> [6] </ref>, the complexity of each tunable receiver (the only active element in the network) is proportional 1 In this paper we use the words node and base station interchangeably. to m, thus, the complexity of the network is proportional to mDN or DN 1+ 1 D which makes this architecture scalable.

Reference-contexts: Note that if a more accurate model for the subnet behavior is used it will only result in a different expression for ffi k . Using Little's formula <ref> [7] </ref>, the total average queueing delay for a packet across the network is given by ffi av = fl k=1 C k j k where fl is the offered traffic in the network; note that fl = N (N 1).
