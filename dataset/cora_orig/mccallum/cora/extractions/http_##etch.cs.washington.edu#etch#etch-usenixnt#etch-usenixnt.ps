Abstract: Etch is a general-purpose tool for rewriting arbitrary Win32/x86 binaries without requiring source code. Etch provides a framework for modifying executables for both measurement and optimization. Etch handles the complexities of the Win32 executable file format and the x86 instruction set, allowing tool builders to focus on specifying transformations. Etch also handles the complexities of the Win32 execution environment, allowing tool users to focus on performing experiments. This paper describes Etch and some of the tools that we have built using Etch, including a hierarchical call graph profiler and an instruction layout optimization tool.
