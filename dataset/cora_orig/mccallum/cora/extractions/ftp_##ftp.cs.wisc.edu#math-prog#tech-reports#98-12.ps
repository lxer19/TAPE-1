Abstract: A fundamental mathematical problem is to find a solution to a square system of nonlinear equations. There are many methods to approach this problem, the most famous of which is Newton's method. In this paper, we describe a generalization of this problem, the complementarity problem. We show how such problems are modeled within the GAMS modeling language and provide details about the PATH solver, a generalization of Newton's method, for finding a solution. While the modeling format is applicable in many disciplines, we draw the examples in this paper from an economic background. Finally, Keywords: Complementarity problems, variational inequalities, algorithms AMS Classification: 90C33,65K10 This paper is an extended version of a talk presented at CEFES '98 (Computation in Economics, Finance and Engineering: Economic Systems) in Cambridge, England in July 1998 some extensions of the modeling format and the solver are described.

Reference-contexts: A GAMS implementation of (3) is given in Figure 2. Many large scale models of this nature have been developed. An interested modeler could, for example, see how a large scale complementarity problem was used to quantify the effects of the Uruguay round of talks <ref> [23] </ref>. In many modeling situations, a key tool for clarification is the use of intermediate variables. As an example, the modeler may wish to define a variable corresponding to the demand function d (p) in the Walrasian equilibrium (3). The syntax for carrying this out is shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The core algorithm is a nonsmooth Newton method [34] to find a zero of the normal map <ref> [33] </ref> F ((x)) + x (x) associated with the MCP. Here (x) represents the projection of x onto [`; u] in the Euclidean norm. If x is a zero of the normal map, then (x) solves the MCP.

Reference-contexts: It is precisely at this point that the pairing of variables and equations shown in (2) occurs in the GAMS code, so that in the example, the function defined by rational is complementary to the variable x. Further information on the GAMS syntax can be found in <ref> [35] </ref>; more examples of problems written using the complementarity problem are found in MCPLIB [7]. sets i canning plants, j markets ; parameter s (i) capacity of plant i in cases, d (j) demand at market j in cases, c (i,j) transport cost in thousands of dollars per case ; positive <p> In the case where a tax is applied at the supply point, the third general inequality in (2) is replaced by p s j ; 8 (i; j) 2 A The taxes can be made endogenous to the model, details are found in <ref> [35] </ref>. The key point to make is that with either of the above modifications, the complementarity problem is not just the optimality conditions of a linear program. In fact, in many cases, there is no optimization problem corresponding to the complementarity conditions.

Reference-contexts: Restart Definitions is shown in [15] that this provides descent and a new feasible point to continue PATH, and convergence to stationary points and/or solutions of the MCP are provided under appropriate conditions. 4 Extensions 4.1 MPSGE The main users of PATH continues to be economists using the MPSGE preprocessor <ref> [36] </ref>. The MPSGE preprocessor adds syntax to GAMS for defining general equilibrium models. For MPSGE models, the default settings of PATH are slightly different due to the fact that many of these models are basically shocks applied to a calibrated base system with a known solution.

Reference-contexts: One particular example that can benefit from this conversion is the matrix balancing problem as described in <ref> [37] </ref>. It is likely that PATH will find a solution to the KKT system. However, this solution is only guaranteed to be a stationary point for the original 25 problem.

Reference-contexts: Currently, only an implementation of the bundle method [31] for solving such problems is available as a GAMS solver. We note that the joint feasibility constraint, g, is not allowed when using the bundle solver. The bundle method reformulates the MPEC as a nondifferentiable program. A nondif-ferentiable optimization package <ref> [38] </ref> is then used to solve the problem. We begin by defining the following: Y (x) := SOL (MCP (F (x; ); [`; u])) (4) We note that for the algorithm to work, the MCP must have a unique solution at each trial value x.

Reference-contexts: There are many applications in economics of the MPEC, including the Stackelberg game <ref> [39] </ref> and optimal taxation. See [28] for more applications and relevant theory. It is possible to formulate an MPEC in the GAMS modeling language [11]. Currently, only an implementation of the bundle method [31] for solving such problems is available as a GAMS solver.
