Abstract: The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent mechanisms in the brain. Such a dissociation could be the result of a competitive learning mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Studies of normal adult performance on face and object recognition tasks seem to indicate that face recognition is primarily configural, involving the low spatial frequency information present in a stimulus over relatively large distances, whereas object recognition is primarily featural, involving analysis of the object's parts using local, high spatial frequency information. In a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, two modules compete to classify input stimuli; when one module receives low spatial frequency information and the other receives high spatial frequency information, the low-frequency module shows a strong specialization for face recognition in a combined face identification/object classification task. The series of experiments shows that the fine discrimination necessary for distinguishing members of a visually homoge neous class such as faces relies heavily on the low spatial frequencies present in a stimulus.

Reference-contexts: What might the basis for this dissociation be? The fact that visual object agnosia, an object recognition deficit, can occur without appreciable impairment of face recognition <ref> [1] </ref> precludes the possibility that face recognition is simply harder than object recognition but is served by the same mechanism.

Reference-contexts: If this scenario is correct, the infant begins to form configural face representations very soon after birth, based primarily on the low spatial frequency information present in face stimuli. Indeed, Costen, Parker, and Craw <ref> [2] </ref> showed that although both high-pass and low-pass image filtering decrease face recognition accuracy, high-pass filtering degrades identification accuracy more quickly than low-pass filtering. Their work indicates that low spatial frequency information is more important to face identification than high spatial frequency information. <p> To our knowledge, this has not been empirically tested, although Costen et al. <ref> [2] </ref> have investigated the effect of high-pass and low-pass filtering on face images in isolation, and Parker, Lishman, and Hughes [12] have investigated the effect of high-pass and low-pass filtering of face and object images used as 100 ms cues for a same/different task. <p> This gives us average cycles per face of f0.68, 2.9, 5.9, 11.75, 23.5g for the five filter frequencies. Costen et al.'s result of 8-16 cycles per face as the optimal spatial frequency band for face recognition in humans <ref> [2] </ref> predicts that the second-highest frequency Gabor filter would best support facial identification in our model, but this is clearly not the case. In the model, the low-frequency Gabor filters may contain more information relevant to face identification because their receptive fields are larger than those of the high-frequency filters.

Reference-contexts: We observed how splitting the range of spatial frequency information between the two modules affected the specializations developed by the network. each frequency. 2.1 Image Data We acquired face images from the Cottrell and Metcalfe facial expression database <ref> [3] </ref> and captured multiple images of several books, cups, and soda cans with a CCD camera and video frame grabber. For the face images, we chose five grayscale images of each of 12 individuals.

Reference-contexts: In previous work, we proposed that a neural mechanism allocating resources according to their ability to perform a given task could explain the apparent specialization for face recognition evidenced by prosopagnosia <ref> [4] </ref>. We showed that a model based on the mixture of experts architecture [10], in which a gating network implements competitive learning between two simple homogeneous modules, could develop a specialization such that damage to one module disproportionately impaired face recognition compared to non-face object recognition.

Reference-contexts: There is also evidence that configural information is highly relevant when a human becomes an "expert" at identifying individuals within other visually homogeneous object classes [7]. What role might configural information play in the development of a specialization for face recognition? de Schonen and Mancini <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed that several factors, including different rates of maturation in different areas of cortex, an infant's tendency to track the faces in its environment, and the gradual increase in visual acuity as an infant develops, all combine to force an early specialization for face recognition.

Reference-contexts: An additional body of evidence indicates that face recognition is based primarily on holistic, configural information, whereas non-face object recognition relies more heavily on local features and analysis of the parts of an object <ref> [6, 13] </ref>. For instance, the distance between the tip of the nose and an eye is an important factor in face recognition, but such subtle measurements are rarely as critical for distinguishing, say, two buildings.

The connections to the output units come from two separate input/hidden layer pairs; these connections are gated multiplicatively by a simple linear network with softmax outputs.

Reference-contexts: Another possibility, that prosopagnosics have impaired within-category discrimination but intact superordinate classification, can be rejected on the basis of studies of extreme prosopagnosic patients such as W.J., who learned a difficult sheep discrimination task remarkably well but could not learn new faces <ref> [11] </ref>. In previous work, we proposed that a neural mechanism allocating resources according to their ability to perform a given task could explain the apparent specialization for face recognition evidenced by prosopagnosia [4].
