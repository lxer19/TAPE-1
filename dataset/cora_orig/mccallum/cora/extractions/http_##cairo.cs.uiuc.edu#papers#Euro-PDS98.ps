Abstract: The maxmin fair bandwidth allocation has been proposed as a flow/congestion control mechanism for managing the best-effort data traffic in connection-oriented networks. It achieves the fairness by assigning an equal share of bandwidth to each flow passing a link whenever possible; it improves the system throughput by fully utilizing the link capacity whenever possible. This type of fairness- and throughput-aware bandwidth allocation and corresponding routing schemes are important in multimedia connection-oriented networks for a class of services, such as ABR in ATM networks, which will carry heterogeneous types of best-effort traffic from non-real-time multimedia to ASCII text flows. We present two contributions in this paper. The first contribution is to define a new set of fairness-throughput relational operators on the set of feasible bandwidth allocations and to show that the maxmin fair allocation maximizes the fairness-throughput performance measured by the new operators. The second contribution is to extend the concept of maxmin from the domain of flow/congestion control to the domain of routing. We propose a maxmin fair routing algorithm which selects the best route for a new flow such that the fairness-throughput performance of the maxmin fair allocation is maximized after the new flow joins in. The proposed algorithm achieves fairness by routing the new flow around congested links, which will improve the overall data throughput as well. Furthermore, an approximation algorithm is presented, which works better for networks with very dynamic states due to its simplicity and more relaxed information requirement on the network state.

Reference-contexts: However, in a long term, fairness may contradict throughput as the proposed algorithm may select an excessively long path which reduces the overall bandwidth available for flows arriving successively. Research showed that short routing paths tend to yield high overall throughput <ref> [13] </ref>. The proposed algorithm can be modified to take the path length into consideration. A maximum allowable length is specified for a new flow based on the distance from the source to the destination.
