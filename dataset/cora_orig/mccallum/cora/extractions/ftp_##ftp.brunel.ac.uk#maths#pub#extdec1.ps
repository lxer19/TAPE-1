Title: Paths and cycles in extended and decomposable digraphs

Abstract: We consider digraphs called extended locally semicomplete digraphs, or extended LSD's, for short that can be obtained from locally semicomplete digraphs by substituting independent sets for vertices. We characterize Hamiltonian extended LSD's as well as extended LSD's containing Hamiltonian paths. These results as well as some additional ones imply polynomial algorithms for finding a longest path and a longest cycle in an extended LSD. Our characterization of Hamil-tonian extended LSD's provides a partial solution to a problem posed by R. Haggkvist in [14]. Combining results from this paper with some general results derived for so-called totally -decomposable digraphs in [3], we prove that the longest path problem is polynomially solvable for totally 0 -decomposable digraphs a fairly wide family of digraphs which is a common generalization of acyclic digraphs, semicomplete multipartite digraphs, extended LSD's and quasi-transitive digraphs. Similar results are obtained for the longest cycle problem and other problems on cycles in subfamilies of totally 0 -decomposable digraphs. These polynomial algorithms are a natural and fairly deep generalization of algorithms obtained for quasi-transitive digraphs in [3] in order to solve a problem posed by N. Alon.

It is shown that extended LSD's inherit some useful properties of both "parents". <p> A locally semicomplete digraph (LSD, for short) is a digraph for which the following holds: for every vertex x the vertices dominated by x induce a semicomplete digraph and the vertices that dominate x induce a semicomplete digraph. It was proved <ref> [1] </ref> that every connected LSD has a Hamiltonian path. A digraph D is strongly connected (or just strong) if there exists an (x; y)path and a (y; x)path in D for every choice of distinct vertices x; y of D. It was shown [1] that every strong LSD has a Hamiltonian <p> It was proved <ref> [1] </ref> that every connected LSD has a Hamiltonian path. A digraph D is strongly connected (or just strong) if there exists an (x; y)path and a (y; x)path in D for every choice of distinct vertices x; y of D. It was shown [1] that every strong LSD has a Hamiltonian cycle. If a digraph is not strong then we can label its strong components D 1 ; : : : ; D s , s 2, such that there is no arc from D j to D i if j &gt; i. <p> In general this labelling is not unique, but it is so for LSD's <ref> [1, Theorem 3.1] </ref>. A k-path-cycle subgraph of a digraph D is a subgraph of D consisting a disjoint collection of k paths and some cycles. If the number of cycles is zero we call it a k-path subgraph. A cycle subgraph is a nonempty 0-path-cycle subgraph. <p> Now 1. follows from the fact that D is an extended LSD. From 1. it follows that the digraph obtained from D by contracting each strong component to one vertex is a non-strong connected LSD. By <ref> [1, Theorem 3.1 (c)] </ref> it follows that the vertices u 0 1 ; : : : ; u 0 k of this LSD can be ordered in a unique way u 1 ; : : :; u k such that there is no arc from u j to u i for <p> Now it is easy to see that the digraph obtained by contracting each cycle C i into one vertex c i is a LSD D 0 . Since D 0 is strong it has a Hamiltonian cycle <ref> [1] </ref>. Let c 1 c 2 : : : c k c 1 be such a cycle, where we have relabelled the cycles to allow the numbering.

Reference-contexts: It is shown that extended LSD's inherit some useful properties of both "parents". Second, combining the results obtained for extended LSD's with some general results derived for totally -decomposable digraphs in <ref> [3] </ref> we prove the longest path problem is polynomially solvable for totally 0 -decomposable digraphs, a fairly wide family of digraphs which is a common generalization of acyclic digraphs, semicomplete multipartite digraphs (see e.g. [4, 10, 11, 16]), extended LSD's and quasi-transitive digraphs (see e.g. [3, 5, 13]). <p> for totally -decomposable digraphs in [3] we prove the longest path problem is polynomially solvable for totally 0 -decomposable digraphs, a fairly wide family of digraphs which is a common generalization of acyclic digraphs, semicomplete multipartite digraphs (see e.g. [4, 10, 11, 16]), extended LSD's and quasi-transitive digraphs (see e.g. <ref> [3, 5, 13] </ref>). Similar results are obtained for the longest cycle problem and other problems on cycles in subfamilies of totally 0 -decomposable digraphs. <p> Similar results are obtained for the longest cycle problem and other problems on cycles in subfamilies of totally 0 -decomposable digraphs.

Alon. <p> Since there are O (n) recursive calls, the complexity of the algorithm is O (n 2 m + n 3 ). 2 8 Paths and cycles in totally i -decomposable digraphs In this section we generalize theorems on heaviest and longest paths and cycles in quasi-transitive digraphs obtained in <ref> [3] </ref>. To obtain the generalizations given in Theorem 8.2 we use both results shown in the previous sections of this paper and an approach suggested in [3]. <p> cycles in totally i -decomposable digraphs In this section we generalize theorems on heaviest and longest paths and cycles in quasi-transitive digraphs obtained in <ref> [3] </ref>. To obtain the generalizations given in Theorem 8.2 we use both results shown in the previous sections of this paper and an approach suggested in [3]. Since the schemes 12 of the proofs of the generalizations are the same as those of the original theorems on quasi-transitive digraphs, we shall give only a sketch for the first two claims of Theorem 8.2 and a few remarks on the rest of the claims. <p> For convenience we define w 0 (D) = 0. We consider the following problem called the HPS problem: Given a digraph D on n vertices, find a heaviest k-path subgraph of D for every k = 1; 2; :::; n. We need the following: Theorem 8.1 <ref> [3] </ref> Let be a set of digraphs including the trivial digraph on one vertex. Suppose that = ext and, for every D 2 on n vertices, w k+1 (D) w k (D) w k (D) w k1 (D); (1) where k = 1; 2; :::; n 1. <p> Proof (sketch): 1. By Theorems 8.1 and 7.3, we can prove the first part of Theorem 8.2 by showing that a digraph D from 0 satisfies the conditions of Theorem 8.1 with s = 4. Using the algorithm on maximum cost flows in networks described in <ref> [3] </ref>, find, for every k = 1; :::; n, a heaviest k-path-cycle subgraph L k of D. This can be done in time O (n 4 ) [3]. <p> Using the algorithm on maximum cost flows in networks described in <ref> [3] </ref>, find, for every k = 1; :::; n, a heaviest k-path-cycle subgraph L k of D. This can be done in time O (n 4 ) [3]. Since D 2 0 , for every k = 1; :::; n, we can construct a k-path subgraph Q k of D so that V (L k ) = V (Q k ). Indeed, if D is acyclic, then just set Q k = L k . <p> Obviously, Q k is a heaviest k-path subgraph of D. Note that Q 1 ; :::; Q n can be found in time O (n 4 ). The inequality (1) now follows from the inequality (2) on flows given in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. Change the weights of the vertices of D as follows. w (x) = 1 if x 2 X and w (x) = 0, otherwise. Obviously, D has a path covering all the vertices of X if and only if a heaviest path of D has weight jXj. 3. <p> Obviously, D has a path covering all the vertices of X if and only if a heaviest path of D has weight jXj. 3. The proof of this claim is the same as the proof of the second part of Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [3] </ref> except for the fact that in [3] we use the second part of Theorem 3.6 [3] and here we use a generalization of the last result given in Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.6 of this paper. 4. <p> The proof of this claim is the same as the proof of the second part of Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [3] </ref> except for the fact that in [3] we use the second part of Theorem 3.6 [3] and here we use a generalization of the last result given in Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.6 of this paper. 4. The proof is similar to that of the second claim of the theorem. 5. <p> The proof of this claim is the same as the proof of the second part of Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [3] </ref> except for the fact that in [3] we use the second part of Theorem 3.6 [3] and here we use a generalization of the last result given in Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.6 of this paper. 4. The proof is similar to that of the second claim of the theorem. 5.
