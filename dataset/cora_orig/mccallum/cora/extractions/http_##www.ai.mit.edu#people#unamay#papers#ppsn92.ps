Abstract: Genetic Programming (GP) has recently been introduced by John R. Koza [5] as a method for genetically breeding populations of computer programs to solve problems. We believe GP to constitute a significant extension of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) research paradigm primarily because it generalizes the genetic search techniques: instead of looking for a solution to a specific instance of a problem, GP attempts to evolve a program capable of computing the solutions for any instance of the problem. We have implemented a genetic programming environment, GP*, that is capable of duplicating Koza`s experiments. In this paper we describe a specific GP experiment on the evolution of programs to sort vectors, and discuss the issues that must be addressed in any application of GP: the design of fitness functions and test suites, and the selection of program terminals and functions. Our observations point to several previously unnoticed shortcomings of the GP approach. We hypothesize that these shortcomings are due to the fact that GP only uses a hierarchical representation but does not construct its solutions in an explicitly hierarchical manner.
