Abstract: This paper presents a study of CPU performance of audio conferences on packet-switched networks using silence deletion. We present a model for measuring audioconfer-ence load, perform micro-experiments measure the CPU load of the audioconference components, perform macro-experiments to test predications based on the micro-experiments, and predict the performance of audioconferences under future technological advances. We find silence deletion reduces the CPU load for audio-conferences with three or more people. Under many future technological advances, silence deletion will continue to benefit audioconferences, although the benefits may not be as significant.

Reference-contexts: Silence deletion removes silent parts from speech. For audioconferences, this means fewer packets sent, received and played. Experiments have shown that silence deletion substantially reduces network load for two reasons: <ref> [Ried93] </ref> 1. In a typical N person conversation, one person is talking and N-1 are silent. Under silence deletion, the silent people contribute minimal network load. 2. Pilot tests suggest about 1/3 and 2/3 of the time speech can be identified as pauses between words or sentences. <p> Riedl, Mashayekhi, Schnepf, Frankowski and Claypool measure CPU load of an audio conference with no oor control and no silence deletion using the counter process. <ref> [Ried93] </ref> They show the CPU loads quickly become prohibitive under increasingly large audioconferences. 2.3 Analyzing UDP Cabrera measures throughput for UDP and TCP for connected Sun workstations.[- Cabr88] In analyzing the UDP call-stack for UDP in detail, he determines the checksum at the receiving end takes the most time.This checksum may

Reference-contexts: If we wish to use the exibility and power of computers to support communication and collaboration, then they must support these media. Multimedia is often continuous, which seems more natural for circuit-switched networks. So why study packet-switched networks? Todays computer networks are usually packet-switched <ref> [Tane89] </ref>, and in the near term, will continue to be more cost effective. 1.3 Effects of Silence Deletion Silence deletion helps develop model for understanding effect of compression on CPU load for distributed multi-media. Silence deletion removes silent parts from speech.
