Reference-contexts: Wave pipelining [9] has been used with complementary pass-transistor logic (CPL) [10] to attain high throughput with low power consumptions <ref> [1] </ref>. But as the authors in [1] point out, the design of a CPL based wave-pipelined circuit is mostly dependent on balancing the delay along different paths and setting the transistor width ratios to achieve proper logic threshold. All these properties vary with process, temperature and other external factors. <p> Wave pipelining [9] has been used with complementary pass-transistor logic (CPL) [10] to attain high throughput with low power consumptions <ref> [1] </ref>.

More recent pipelined multipliers, exploit pipelining at the half-adder or XOR gate level [7, 1]. <p> We designed a pipelined array multiplier using carry-save adder arrays, as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. An array of full-adder cells are used to accumulate and propagate the partial sum and carry. Each row of full-adders also adds a new row of partial products to the partial sum and carry. <p> For the final adder stage, which accumulates the partial sum and carry values into the final product, we use a triangular vector merge array of half-adder as described in <ref> [2] </ref> for the same reasons, i.e., reduction of pipeline latency, reduction in the extra de-skewing registers and regular structure. 3.2 The structure of the basic modules Our goal is to design the multiplier for maximum throughput.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the power consumption of the C 2 MOS circuit is much smaller than the other implementations which results in a significantly smaller power-delay product for C 2 MOS. 2.2 Comparisons with other techniques True single phase logic proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> has a simpler clocking structure and the advantage of a single phase clock. Even though the global clock routing in true single phase logic is simpler than C 2 MOS, the number of clock transistors increase compared to C 2 MOS (figure 4).

Reference-contexts: The fastest existing pipelined multiplier is wave-pipelined using normal process complementary pass transistor logic (NPCPL) and has a throughput rate of 400 million multiplications per second, consuming 0.8 W power with 0.8 micron technology <ref> [7] </ref>. We compare our design with several other pipelined multiplier designs, including true single-phase logic based, CPL-based, NMOS based and quasi n-p domino logic based designs exploiting pipelining at various granular-ities.

Reference-contexts: Conclusions and future research goals are presented in section five. 2 The C MOS logic family The C 2 MOS logic family was first proposed in 1973 for calculator circuits as a low-power and smaller area logic alternative <ref> [8] </ref>. However, at that time dynamic logic, especially logic requiring complicated clocking was not considered very practical. With the advance in VLSI techniques the generation of high-speed clocks with controlled skew have become possible.
