Title: Temporal Reasoning with Constraints on Fluents and Events

Affiliation: Department of Information and Computer Science University of California,  
Abstract: We propose a propositional language for temporal reasoning that is computationally effective yet expressive enough to describe information about fluents, events and temporal constraints. Although the complete inference algorithm is exponential, we characterize a tractable core with limited expressibility and inferential power. Our results render a variety of constraint propagation techniques applica ble for reasoning with constraints on fluents.

Reference-contexts: In dynamic environments the atomic entities are called fluents. They may repeatedly change their value as events occur and are functions of the situation or time. Our work builds upon temporal languages proposed by McDermott and Dean [11, 5], Allen <ref> [2] </ref>, Kowalski and Sergot [9] and Shoham [14]. We accommodate various constructs proposed in these languages (time points and intervals). Our main goal, however, is to equip a temporal language with a com-putationally manageable inference engine. The primary task of any reasoning system is determining consistency of the given theory.

Reference-contexts: We enumerate all minimal models of the propositional part of a CTN and for each of them determine whether the applicable temporal network is consistent. The task of computing the minimal models of a CNF formula has been investigated and is known to be hard <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. For Horn formulas, the minimal model is unique and can be computed in polynomial time, thus tractability depends on the temporal constraints.
