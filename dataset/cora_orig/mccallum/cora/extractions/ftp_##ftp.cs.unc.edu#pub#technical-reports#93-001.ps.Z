Abstract: This technical report presents the results of measurements made to characterize the end-toend delays in head-mounted display (HMD) systems. The term end-to-end delay is used here to describe the total time required for the displayed image in a HMD to change in response to the movement of a users head. Included in the total end-to-end delay is: resulting picture. 4) Display system delay - the time required to display the image in the head Primary motivation for this work was the desire to characterize the relative performance (in terms of measurement latency) of the various tracking technologies currently in use at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Included in the test were four commercial magnetic trackers: two from Ascension Technology Corporation (the Ascension Bird and the newer Flock of Birds), and two from Polhemus Incorporated (the Polhemus 3Space Tracker and the 3Space Fastrak models). Also included in the test was UNCs own Optical Ceiling Tracker. Note that both the Ascension Bird and the Polhemus 3 Space Tracker are older models and are no longer in production. Though the main variable in all of the described measurements was the tracking technology in use, the utility of these measurements was not limited to the characterization of tracker measurement delays. These experiments provided an opportunity to determine the contribution of all the components in a HMD system to the end-to-end delays. The experiments described in this paper are a part of the overall program at UNC to reduce the end-to-end delays in head-mounted display systems. It is believed that these delays are a key detractor from the feeling of presence in a virtual world. In addition, for see-through head-mounted displays, the presence of end-to-end delays greatly complicates the critical task of registration of virtual and real world objects. Reducing these system end-to-end delays, therefore, is one of the keys to improved head-mounted display system performance. For this paper, the end-to-end delay in an HMD system is defined as the time it takes for the displayed image in an HMD to change in response to a change in the position or orientation of a users head. The total end-to-end delay can be broken down into several major components, each of which represents a single stage in the HMD pipeline, the set of computations that take place in the generation of a virtual world.
