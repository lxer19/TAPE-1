Reference-contexts: Educational content is provided through examples and help features, drills, puzzles, or "playgrounds" where the user can manipulate abstract representations of concepts to discover concepts by themselves <ref> [BS92, GON92, Pau93, CG95] </ref>. Phoenix Quest, a game developed by E-GEMS (Electronic Games for Education in Mathematics and Science) for students in grades five to eight, addresses many of these issues. The premise of Phoenix Quest is two characters, Julie and Darien, are trapped in an alternate reality.

Reference-contexts: Conclusions and future work are presented in section 6. 2 Justification for Using Conversation Nets Children in grades five to eight are the primary users of this natural language interface. This results in several issues that would be less noticeable in an adult context. Bates et al <ref> [BW93] </ref> note that for adults accessing a database using natural language, novel or errorful language accounts for 25-30% of the input. With children, the problem is even more complicated. From our observations [Gri95], in informal communications, children tend not to worry about correct spelling, grammar, or semantic structure.

Reference-contexts: One other major drawback of syntactic and semantic analysis is that for such a large domain of knowledge, it would be very slow and for this reason completely unusable by children. Natural language generation techniques to date have used detail models of limited domains, such as the PROTEUS program <ref> [Dav79] </ref> that does natural analysis of tic-tac-toe games. However, no attempts to handle a more general domain have been successful. The combination of natural language understanding and generation, as in Julie and Darien, is even more complicated.

Reference-contexts: They expect replies to their letters almost instantly, and a slow interface discourages them from writing. These issues present difficulties for many of the common approaches to natural language understanding and generation. Syntactic parsing using the relatively simple rules that make up a context-free grammar <ref> [Mar91, Gri86] </ref> is extremely difficult when the input is un-grammatical and contains many spelling errors.

From our observations <ref> [Gri95] </ref>, in informal communications, children tend not to worry about correct spelling, grammar, or semantic structure. These language processing challenges are only increased when the user has difficulty with the keyboard interface. A further challenge 5 is the impatience of children when playing computer games.

Reference-contexts: Attitudes considered included friendly, inquisitive, flirtatious, abusive, defensive, critical, duplicitous, narrative and sarcastic. A fourth dimension analyzed was popularity of topics and the effectiveness of the nets when talking about particular topics. Selected results from this analysis are in section 5 and are presented in more detail in <ref> [Hui96] </ref>. Such analysis allows programmers to focus their efforts on areas that are both popular and need improvement. 17 5 Results The nets have been tested within two different contexts, in a stand-alone environment where the only task is to write to the characters, and from within Phoenix Quest.

Reference-contexts: Development of a story chronicling Julie and Darien's adventures, written by award winning children's author Julie Lawson [Law93]. 5. Interactions with the characters in the story. Meanwhile, several techniques and and activities to encourage learning are used: 1. Awkward interfaces that focus attention on the mathematical concepts <ref> [KP95] </ref>. 2. Evanescent scaffolding (giving easy tasks and more help at easier levels, then increasing the difficulty as the player progresses.) 3. Playgrounds for exploring concepts. 4. Activities that provide practice in working with various concepts. 5. Knowledge-based discourse.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Edutainment software, software that uses an entertaining context to encourage users to achieve educational goals, is often effective at motivating students to practice skills they already know, but has been less effective at actually teaching students skills they do not already have <ref> [RMWW92, KSW95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The most obvious benefit is that it exercises the child's reading and writing skills. Other potential educational benefits can arise from knowledge-based discourse. Discussing math and science problems encourages the child to reflect on underlying concepts associated with the problems <ref> [Lav88, LW91, Pim95, UPHss] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The result is that, to the user, the dialogue lacks transitions and seems superficial and inconsequential. Conversation nets combine some of the features of Eliza with a control mechanism similar to that proposed by Mauldin <ref> [Mau94] </ref>. They are composed of a series of conversational nodes and directional weighted links between the nodes.

This technique does not attempt to understand the meaning of the sentence at all. Instead, it looks for particular patterns and echoes the input of the user as output, in a slightly transformed form.
