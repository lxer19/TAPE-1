Reference-contexts: In 1961, Murray Gell-Mann proposed a system for arranging the baryons and 1 mesons into well-defined geometrical patterns (a sort of "Periodic Table" for the elementary particles), known as the Eightfold Way <ref> [1] </ref>. The Eightfold way grouped mesons into sets of eight (called octets) and baryons into either octets or decuplets (groups of 10).

Reference-contexts: In early 1964, just such a particle was observed in the BNL 80-inch bubble chamber [2]. This was a stunning success for the Eightfold Way, but there was still no fundamental understanding of why it worked so well. Gell-Mann and Zweig independently proposed <ref> [3] </ref>, in 1964, that all hadrons were composed of even smaller elementary particles that Gell-Mann called quarks, of which there were three types ("flavours"). The quarks carry fractional electric charge, fractional baryon number, and a strangeness of 0 or 1.

Reference-contexts: In 1988, a stunning announcement was made: a manifestly exotic state had been observed with a mass of around 1.4 GeV/c, decaying into 0 , by the GAMS group <ref> [5] </ref> at CERN. It was imperative that such an important claim be confirmed independently. Experiment E852 at Brookhaven National Laboratory was designed with the verification of the GAMS state as one of its primary goals. E852 was designed with 3 several advantages over GAMS. <p> This state also requires confirmation. 1.7.3 Other States There are several other interesting states in addition to those mentioned above. The first is the ^(1405), a 1 + manifestly exotic state. The ^(1405) has been seen by the GAMS group in p ! 0 n <ref> [5] </ref>, but the partial wave analysis used has been called into question by Prokoshkin [54], and the current status of the state is unclear. The initial observation of this state, as was mentioned previously, was one of the primary motivating factors for E852 and the analysis presented in this thesis. <p> smallest correspond to &lt; 5% acceptance. 136 Chapter 7 Results 7.1 Overview In 1988, the GAMS group, working at CERN, claimed evidence for a J P C = 1 + manifestly exotic resonance, the ^(1405), decaying into 0 in the reaction p ! 0 n ! 4fln at 100 GeV/c <ref> [5] </ref>. This stunning result begged confirmation and indeed, one of the primary physics goals of E852 at the Brookhaven AGS was to search for the ^(1405) in the same reaction in an independent experiment and at a lower energy. <p> The ^(1405) did not appear as a "bump" in the 0 mass spectrum in the original sighting. Rather it supposedly manifested itself in an asymmetry in the 0 angular distribution and in the subsequent partial wave analysis (PWA). According to <ref> [5] </ref>, the 0 mass distributions are different for events with forward 's (cos GJ &gt; 0) compared to that for backward 's (cos GJ &lt; 0) (see Figures 7.1 (a) and (b) ).

Reference-contexts: States composed of q qq q can also form a colour singlet, as can any combination of the form (q 3 ) m (q q) n <ref> [6] </ref>. Since the gluons transform as a colour octet, the gg system g g = 8 8 = 27 10 10 8 8 1; (1.4) can form a colour singlet (as can any combination of more than two gluons), and physically allowed states composed entirely of gluons can be formed. <p> Many radial excitations of the light quark states are believed to lie in the 1:3 2:0 GeV mass region, and the decays of these mesons are not well understood theoretically, leading to difficulties in identifying non-q q states <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> In the isovector region, there are two candidates : the a 0 (980) and the a 0 (1450). Once again, there is fairly convincing evidence to interpret the a 0 (980) as a K K state <ref> [6, 39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Kinematically favored decays that exhibit small branching ratios are therefore a possible indicator of quark content. Figure 1.2 shows the quark flow diagrams for the decays ! K + K , ! + 0 , and ! ! + 0 . The observed <ref> [10] </ref> branching ratios are: ( ! + 0 ) = 0:15; ( tot ) and (! tot ) so even though the 3 decay of the is kinematically favoured, it is suppressed relative to the K K modes. <p> In addition to the possibility of manifestly exotic quantum numbers, both the flux tube [28] and constituent gluon [21] - [25] models predict that the lightest hybrids 3 The Particle Data Group lists four f 0 's and nine f 2 's. <ref> [10] </ref> 15 J P C Width (MeV) I = 1 I = 0, non-strange 2 + 170 265 0 + 1665 460 1 ++ 565 1160 0 + 370 460 Table 1.3: Predicted widths from the flux tube model of I = 1 and I = 0 non-strange hybrids from [30]. <p> This hypothesis is supported by several experimental observations: * Anomalously strong coupling to constituent channels. For the f 0 (980), for example, the branching ratios B (K K)=B () 1=4 <ref> [10] </ref> despite small phase space for the decay into K K. * Anomalously small coupling to flfl relative to the q q states. The flfl partial width of the f 0 (980) is measured to be 0:56 0:11 KeV [10], which is smaller by an order of magnitude than that expected <p> (980), for example, the branching ratios B (K K)=B () 1=4 <ref> [10] </ref> despite small phase space for the decay into K K. * Anomalously small coupling to flfl relative to the q q states. The flfl partial width of the f 0 (980) is measured to be 0:56 0:11 KeV [10], which is smaller by an order of magnitude than that expected for a q q scalar. Such a width is expected for a K K molecule [40]. 1.6 Experimental Searches The theoretical predictions discussed above provide guidance for experimentalists searching for non-q q states. <p> This interpretation is supported by the large coupling of the state to K K ((K K)=(all) = 21:9 2:4%), the small branching ratio to flfl ((flfl) = 0:56 0:11 MeV) <ref> [10, 40] </ref>. Amsler has suggested that the ground-state q q system should be identified as the f 0 (1370) [41, 42]. The composition of the f 0 (400 1200) and the f 0 (1500) are not as clear. <p> This still leaves seven additional 2 ++ states listed in the 1996 RPP: f 2 (1430), f 2 (1565), f 2 (1640), f 2 (1810), f 2 (2010), f 2 (2150), f 2 (2300) and f 2 (2340) <ref> [10] </ref>. There is a great deal of room for radial excitations in the 1:5 2:5 GeV mass region, however, and one must be careful when attempting to identify the nature of these states. Some of the more interesting candidates are elaborated upon below. <p> It has also been observed by GAMS in 0 [64]. This state is of interest due to its proximity to the 2 ++ glueball prediction and its small width ( = 38 +15 13 MeV <ref> [10] </ref>). More confirmation is needed, in particular an unambiguous determination of the spin. 1.8 Specification of Decay Kinematics It is important at this point to introduce the kinematic variables that will be used throughout this work. <p> The fit for the D + wave is shown in Figure 7.23, and gives M = 1:316 0:005 GeV with a 2 of 1.27, consistent with published values for the a 2 (1320) (M=1317:6 1.5 MeV, = 105:5 1:8 MeV <ref> [10] </ref>). Figure 7.24 shows the fit to the D 0 wave. Once again, parameters consistent with the a 2 (1320) meson are obtained: M = 1:299 0:011 GeV The 2 for this fit is 0.55.

Reference-contexts: The most promising calculations of glueball masses have come from lattice gauge theory. The two most prominent groups studying glueballs in lattice gauge theory predict the lightest glueball state to be a 0 ++ state with a mass of 1:550 0:050 GeV in one calculation <ref> [11] </ref> and 1:740 0:071 GeV for another [12]. There are also predictions for the lightest tensor state from the same groups, with the 2 ++ state at 2:270 0:100 GeV [11] or 2:359 0:128 GeV [12].

The squared invariant couplings for this state given by Amsler [47] are (f 0 (1500) ! : K K : : 0 ) = 1 : 1=8:6 (95% CL) : 0:24 0:12 : 0:35 0:15: These seem to be inconsistent with the predictions for a pure glueball.

What to Look For * States with exotic quantum numbers. <p> This interpretation is supported by the large coupling of the state to K K ((K K)=(all) = 21:9 2:4%), the small branching ratio to flfl ((flfl) = 0:56 0:11 MeV) <ref> [10, 40] </ref>. Amsler has suggested that the ground-state q q system should be identified as the f 0 (1370) [41, 42]. The composition of the f 0 (400 1200) and the f 0 (1500) are not as clear.

Reference-contexts: The entire assembly is carried by a transporter to allow each module to be placed in an electron beam for calibration. A laser-based monitoring system was used to illuminate the detector to monitor fluctuations in phototube gains. The glass, photomultipliers and bases are described in detail in Reference <ref> [71] </ref>. The transverse dimensions of each block were determined by an automated measuring system. The average block size was 40:0068 mm with a standard deviation 40 of 24:0 m. The high precision machining of the blocks allowed them to be stacked tightly in the array. <p> The space between two typical blocks as determined by a feeler gauge was less than 100 m. The quantum efficiency and noise rate was measured for each PMT. The average quantum efficiency was 21% with a standard deviation of 3%. The Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier bases <ref> [71] </ref> have the advantages of relatively low power use (2 kW for the 3045 bases and power distribution system) and reduced cabling mass (the system provides power to the bases with a 10 conductor ribbon cable instead of bulky high voltage cables). 2.6.2 The LGD Transporter We calibrate the lead glass <p> Table 2.7 summarizes some of the parameters of the horizontal and vertical drive systems. Further detail on the motor drive system, the interlocks, and the rotational position transducers is given in Reference <ref> [71] </ref>. The transporter was fabricated, assembled, and mounted on a rail system in the high bay area of the Indiana University Physics Department. Safety tests of the transporter were conducted there by exercising the full range of motion of the transporter under load. <p> The light output varied by a factor of about 2:5 from the corners (where the fibers were attached) to the center, due to attenuation in the acrylic bars <ref> [71] </ref>. In the present system a pulsed nitrogen laser 4 with an average power of 6 mW, a maximum pulse energy of 400 J, and a peak emission of 337 nm, excited a small cylinder of scintillator (0.5 in. thick, 1 in. diameter) housed inside the laser enclosure. <p> Here we review the essential features of the ADCs and describe their implementation in the trigger for the 3045 element lead glass array of E852.

Reference-contexts: The linear weighting results in the position being determined as the energy weighted first moment of the module positions. The LIN method assumes that the transverse profile of the shower is roughly linear, where in fact the observed profile is best described by a double exponential <ref> [76] </ref>. This exponential shape motivates the use of a logarithmic energy weighting. <p> The difference between the LOG and LOG2 methods is in how the weighting of the center block is handled. The shower profile observed in <ref> [76] </ref> is best described by a double exponential, with a relatively hard central region.

Reference-contexts: This does not appear to be the case for the observed a 0 . Unfortunately, the only operable theory for describing these distributions is Regge phenomenology [81]. Regge phenomenology often requires the addition of "special cases" in order to successfully describe experimental data <ref> [81, 82] </ref>, and b 1 exchange has not been investigated in any detail at this time. It is thus very difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the observed a 0 jtj distribution, other than that it seems to be consistent with one pion exchange. <p> This should be compared with Figure 7.1 (a) and (b). duction. Based on data from Corden et. al [83], Sacharidis has developed the Regge exchange picture to describe a 2 production in terms of exchange <ref> [82] </ref>. Figure 7.9 shows the observed a 2 jtj distribution compared to the data from Corden et. al.

Reference-contexts: Thus, by fitting linear combinations of angular distributions to the angular distribution observed in the data, the production amplitudes may be found. A more detailed description of this formalism can be found in <ref> [84] </ref>. 7.3.1 Intensity Distributions Experiment measures, for a given bin of m and t, the product of the probability of producing an event which will decay with angles (; ) and the probability that such an event may be detected by the apparatus. <p> A wise choice, of course, may aid in the physical interpretation of the production amplitudes. One possible choice for such a basis could be the spherical harmonics or the slightly more general (although unnormalized) D-functions <ref> [84] </ref>. <p> Definition of the Reflectivity Basis A more useful choice of basis than spherical harmonics is the reflectivity basis <ref> [84] </ref>. The reflectivity basis is a basis that does not possess the mixed symmetries of the 151 D-functions or spherical harmonics under rotations about the y axis. This basis may built from linear combinations of D-functions or spherical harmonics. <p> The modified D-functions could have been defined as the addition, rather than subtraction, of two terms. With the current choice of sign, the production amplitudes for a given reflectivity * correspond to production via the exchange of particle with the same naturality 1 as reflectivity <ref> [84] </ref>. Intensity and Amplitudes in the Reflectivity Basis In the reflectivity basis Equations 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 are extended to include a sum over *. <p> The assumption has been made that the production amplitudes, * V , do not depend on k. In practice, the production amplitudes for jmj &gt; 1 are assumed to be zero <ref> [84] </ref> This simplifies the functional form of the intensity function, a fact which will allow the investigation of ambiguities in Section 7.3.5. <p> The technique used in this analysis is the comparison of the moments, H (LM ), predicted by the partial wave fit and the experimentally observed moments. The intensity function can be written <ref> [84] </ref> in terms of the moments H (LM ) as I () = LM 2L + 1 M0 (; ; 0) (7.27) where H (LM ) = l;m;l 0 ;m 0 2l 0 + 1 ! 1=2 mm 0 (l 0 m 0 LM jlm)(l 0 0L0jl0) (7.28) and is the <p> This form is not yet useful. Proceed by defining the variable u = tan and replacing the functions d l m0 () with the functions e l m0 (u). Explicit forms of the d l m0 and e l m0 may be found in the appendix of reference <ref> [84] </ref>. <p> Ambiguities With Only S, P , and D Waves For this analysis, only S, P , and D waves are considered. The h-functions defined in Equation 7.44 can be written explicitly (see <ref> [84] </ref> for the explicit representations of the e l (1 + u 2 ) 2 h 0 (u) = S 0 (1 + u 2 ) 2 + 3P 0 (1 u 4 ) + 5D 0 (1 4u 2 + u 4 ) 2 (1 + u 2 ) 2 <p> write Equation 7.45 as I () = 4 p 164 In the case where there are only two positive reflectivity waves (P + and D + ), we can write I () = 4 p 10 () + 10D + d 2 Substituting the explicit forms for the d-functions from <ref> [84] </ref> and separating the real and imaginary parts yields I () = 4 p p +[ 3 sin =(P + ) + 15 sin cos =(D + )] 2 ) sin 2 (7.62) Squaring both terms, we get I () = 3 sin 2 (=(P + ) 2 + =(D +

Reference-contexts: Non-trivial Ambiguities Non-trivial ambiguities may give rise to solutions with radically different behaviors. The various ambiguous sets are not related to each other by a simple process such as complex conjugation of the waves. Instead the method of Barrelet zeroes <ref> [85] </ref> is used to move from one (fitted) set of waves to other (predicted) sets of waves.

Reference-contexts: The ratio of the amplitudes of the two fits give A (D 0 )=A (D + ) = 0:64 0:10, indicating the the D 0 wave is indeed a significant fraction of the observed a 2 resonance. This effect has been observed previously by GAMS <ref> [88] </ref> in p ! 0 n at 100 GeV. 3 The most likely explanation involves the finite acceptance of the apparatus.

Reference-contexts: As the acceptance becomes small in regions of (m; t; ; ), the orthogonality of the basis set begins to break down as the regions that differentiate the different basis states become inaccessible. Similar effects have been observed in other PWA's on different final states <ref> [89] </ref>. This interpretation of the D 0 wave is favored over direct production via b 1 exchange due to the observed lack of signal in the D 0 wave at high jtj.

Reference-contexts: Attempts have been made to fit the S 0 wave to the parameterization suggested by Flatte <ref> [90] </ref>, which takes into account the onset of K K threshold when parameterizing the resonance. These fits prove to be extremely unstable, primarily due to the instability of the S 0 wave solution.

Phase Motion Measurement of phase motion across a resonance is only possible within the framework of the partial wave analysis when there is another non-zero wave present in the same mass region. In addition, the waves of positive and negative reflectivity cannot interfere.
