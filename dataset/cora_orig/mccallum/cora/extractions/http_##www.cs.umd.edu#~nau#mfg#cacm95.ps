Abstract: Smooth integration of computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) is vital for companies survival in the present competitive marketplace. One key component in this effort is the representation of product designs in terms of features, elements that are semantically higher-level than the pure geometric elements typically used in CAD and CAM systems. In design, features capture explicitly engineering attributes and relationships among product definition entitiesinformation that is essential for various design tasks and analyses. In manufacturing, features can be linked to manufacturing knowledge of various types. The knowledge facilitates manufacturing process planning and generating the detailed operating instructions required by modern production systems such as CNC machines, flexible manufacturing systems, robots, and inspection equipment. As importantly, features provide a basis of organizing manufacturing information in a data repository for data reuse in new product design, production development, and quality management.

Reference-contexts: Assembly process problems such as poor quality, poor efficiency, or high cost (which all are interrelated) are most effectively handled at early design stage. This has resulted in the design-for-assembly approach <ref> [Boot94] </ref>, where the most economical assembly process is selected during design, and the product is adapted to the chosen method. Assembly sequence planning and assembly operations planning are closely related to path planning in robotics and inspection planning.

Reference-contexts: Although this approach is quite popular (examples include the Quick Turnaround Cell <ref> [Chan90] </ref>, NEXT-Cut [Kamb93], and alpha_1 [Stur95]), one drawback is that it forces the designer to think in manufacturing terms even though he/she may find this unnatural.

Reference-contexts: A related topic is disassembly planning, which is important for recycling and disposal of used products. Work in this area has been successful enough that a system for disassembly planning <ref> [Chen94] </ref> is being marketed commercially. Inspection Planning A popular current manufacturing trend is error-free "six-sigma" manufacturing, whose goal is to ensure that bad parts are almost never produced.

Reference-contexts: The indicated portions of the graph correspond to manufacturing features. 19 <ref> [Gupt94b] </ref>). Volume-based methods can produce overlapping sets of features like the ones shown in Figure 10. Two popular approaches are cellular decomposition and trace-based methods. Cellular decomposition [Saku94,Shah94] partitions the delta volume into convex cells, then combines these into manufacturing features (see Figure 11).
