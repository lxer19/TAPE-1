Abstract: By combining structural biology studies with biochemical methods and DNA techniques scientists are trying to answer questions about how viruses infect a wide range of animal, plant, and bacterial hosts, and to explore the molecular mechanisms by which viruses evade the immune systems of these hosts. In this paper we provide an overview of macromolecular crystallography and electron microscopy methods, followed by a survey of existing graphics packages used for molecular modeling. Then we present Tonitza, an interactive environment for structural biology which allows visualization, analysis, and manipulation of large data sets produced in structural biology experiments.

Reference-contexts: The new map can be subsequently displayed in various representations and may give some insight about the relationship between the two maps. A special case is the difference of two data sets. Figure 3 shows a shaded surface representation of the Ross-River virus <ref> [1] </ref> in its native form together with Fab antibody fragments attached to it. The surface of the antibodies corresponds to a map computed as the difference between data representing the complex form of the virus attached with antibodies and the native virus structure. <p> Stacks of contours plots can be created for a set of sections, to allow interpretation from a 3D perspective. Figure 4 (a) shows a contour map for the Ross-River virus, with electron density contoured at three levels. The map illustrates the overall organization within the multilayered virus structure <ref> [1] </ref>. The positions of the icosahedral two-, three-, and five-fold axes are shown. Figure 4 (b) depicts an equatorial section (through the same virus structure) as a continuous scale map. The map shows regions of membrane pinching which are suggested to be the regions of transmembrane connections [1]. <p> multilayered virus structure <ref> [1] </ref>. The positions of the icosahedral two-, three-, and five-fold axes are shown. Figure 4 (b) depicts an equatorial section (through the same virus structure) as a continuous scale map. The map shows regions of membrane pinching which are suggested to be the regions of transmembrane connections [1]. The arrows in Figure 4 (b) indicate two such regions. A stack of contours for a Coxackievirus B3 mask map is shown in Figure 4 (c). The map reveals the spatial arrangement of particles within an asymmetric unit. <p> In the case of the Ross-River virus, for instance, spherical sections reveal the glycoprotein spikes as flower-like structures that project outward from the virus structure and have a hollow base (Figure 5) <ref> [1] </ref>. Isosurfaces are a different kind of representation which provides information about sets of points within a data volume that have associated a particular scalar value. In Tonitza, iso-surfaces can be displayed as wireframe or shaded, for the entire data volume or for selected subvolumes. <p> Figure 6 (a) shows a shaded representation of a Ross-River spike. The figure clearly reveals the three-fold nature of the surface spike and the bilobal nature of each of the spike petals <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 6 (b) shows a shaded representation of a Ross-River isosurface viewed along a three-fold axis. The figure is overlaid with a lattice which shows the relative positions of the spikes with respect to the two-, three-, and five-fold symmetry axes.

Reference-contexts: For example, cryo-electron microscopy studies showed that the structure of the Ross-River 9 virus inferred from several crystallographic experiments was incorrect <ref> [2] </ref>. The mistake was detected by comparing surface features of the Ross-River virus from two data sets with and without bound antibody fragments. Before two such structures can be displayed, they have to be brought to the same scale.

Reference-contexts: Structural biology uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy (EM) methods to gather information about the 3D atomic structure of large macromolecules like proteins and viruses. Then, intricate computations, often involving parallel computers <ref> [3] </ref>, are used to refine the experimental data and produce high resolution electron density maps in the case of X-ray crystallography, or to reconstruct the 3D structure in the case of electron microscopy. <p> Such particles usually exhibit a high degree of symmetry and it is important to be able to select subvolumes for visualization based on the symmetry elements relative to the original data set (usually given in `standard orientation' <ref> [3] </ref>). This feature also allows one to slice the data volume with arbitrary planes and to visualize it in arbitrary orientations.

Reference-contexts: Biological molecules differ in their complexity, small proteins have several thousands of atoms while large macromolecules like viruses could have millions of atoms. For example a protein like streptavidin has some 7,000 atoms while the monkey tumor virus has 900,000 non-hydrogen atoms <ref> [4] </ref>. Structure determination of small molecules has become a routine process nowadays. In contrast, the determination of macromolecular structures such as viruses remains a lengthy and difficult task. <p> Finally, in the model building phase, high resolution electron density maps, information gathered through EM studies, and chemical information allow the structural biologist to determine the 3D atomic structure. According to Hendrickson <ref> [4] </ref>, 484 new atomic level structures were determined in 1994, 352 by X-ray crystallography, 100 by NMR spectroscopy, and 1 each by fiber diffraction and electron microscopy. <p> = (x j ; y j ; z j ) measured in fractions of unit-cell lengths, then the electron density distribution is given by (r) = V h Macromolecular crystallography requires a sequence of experimental and analytical steps namely crystallization, diffraction measurements, phase evaluation, density map interpretation, and model refinement <ref> [4] </ref>. Here we discuss only the evaluation of phases, and the model building. Phase evaluation. The X-rays scattered by biological molecules infer both constructively and destructively, producing a diffraction pattern which can be recorded on a photographic emulsion or using a CCD detector. <p> Density map interpretation and model building. The atomic model of a macromolecule can be build using high resolution, 2-3 A, electron density maps. If phases are accurate, a polypeptide chain can be traced at about 3.5 A, and individual atoms are isolated at about 1.2 A <ref> [4] </ref>. Graphics tools like O (see 1) designed by Alwyn Jones are invaluable at this step. Electron Microscopy. In correlation with X-ray diffraction, biochemical, genetic, immunological, and model building studies, image processing of electron micrographs is a powerful tool for investigating the basis of molecular events in living systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction To gain insight into biological processes scientists need to know where the atoms are located in biological molecules and how they change during biochemical reactions. In his book on protein structure <ref> [10] </ref>, Max Perutz explains how `protein crystallography has opened a submicroscopic world where potential drug targets can be mapped out in atomic detail' and drugs can be made to measure for a variety of diseases from hypertension to HIV, how proteins recognize each other, and how they recognize genes. <p> In 1912 Max von Laue discovered that X-rays are diffracted by crystals and one year later W. L. Bragg founded X-ray analysis <ref> [10] </ref>. In his Nobel lecture, Bragg explains the foundation of X-ray analysis: `the rays are diffracted by the electrons grouped around the center of each atom. In some directions the atoms conspire to give a strong scattered beam, in others their effects almost annul each other by interference.

Reference-contexts: Phases cannot, therefore, be 3 measured directly from X-ray diffraction images. Several techniques, including the heavy atom, isomorphous replacement, and molecular replacement methods were devised to solve the phase problem. We briefly describe the molecular replacement method introduced by Michael G. Ross-mann and David Blow in 1963 <ref> [11] </ref>. In this method one starts with a low resolution model of a virus (e.g. hollow spheres or possibly a related virus with a known structure). This approximate initial solution is then refined taking into account the known symmetry of the virus.
