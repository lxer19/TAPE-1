Title: RESIDUAL MODELING IN MUSIC ANALYSIS-SYNTHESIS

Abstract: In analysis-synthesis of musical sounds based on a sinusoidal model, the difference between the original signal and the synthesized signal, termed the residual, is typically a broadband noise process. It contains such musical phenomena as flute breath noise or violin bow noise. Synthesis without such "noise" tends to sound artificial; it is desirable to improve the synthesis realism by modeling the residual in such a way that it can be reinjected in the synthesized signal. This paper deals with a model of noise perception based on the equivalent rectangular bands (ERBs) of the auditory system. Since a broadband noise is perceptually well-represented by the time-varying energy in each of these frequency bands, the residual is parametrized in terms of these energies in the proposed model. An application of the model to music synthesis based on the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) is described in detail.

Reference-contexts: A common model for musical signals is a deterministic plus stochastic decomposition where the deterministic component d (t) is a sum of slowly-evolving sinusoids called partials and the stochastic component s (t) is a broadband noise process <ref> [1] </ref>: d (t) = q=1 Here, Q is the number of partials; A q (t) describes the time-varying amplitude of the q-th partial and the total phase fi q (t) describes its frequency evolution and phase offset. <p> For this signal model, the analysis typically consists of a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) followed by a spectral peak-picking algorithm that tracks the peaks from one analysis frame to the next; such an analysis typically finds the amplitude, frequency, and phase of each partial in each frame <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. If the partial parameters vary slowly with respect to the analysis frame rate, the frame rate samples can be reliably interpolated in the ensuing synthesis using low-order evolution models such as linear amplitude.

Reference-contexts: Equivalently, additive synthesis can be done in the frequency domain by using the parameter tracks from the analysis to derive a short-time spectrum for each synthesis frame and then performing an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) followed by overlap-add (OLA) to create the time-domain output <ref> [3] </ref>. The short-time spectrum of the deterministic component is built by accumulating a weighted spectral lobe for each partial, where the lobe corresponds to the main lobe of the DFT of an appropriately chosen time-domain window. <p> The following section discusses an FFT-based implementation of this model for use in a frequency-domain music synthesizer. 3. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL 3.1. Frequency-Domain Additive Synthesis Frequency-domain additive synthesis was introduced by Rodet and Depalle as an alternative to time-domain ap proaches <ref> [3] </ref>. The first stage in the synthesis is the construction of the short-time spectrum of a given frame. <p> The final output is synthesized using OLA with a triangular window, which provides linear amplitude interpolation across synthesis frames. The partial frequencies are interpolated nonlinearly based on phase-matching constraints at the frame boundaries <ref> [3, 6] </ref>. 3.2. Residual Analysis The residual analysis is based on three requirements: * It should derive a small set of perceptually meaningful parameters.

Reference-contexts: The classical critical (dashed) and ERBs (solid). bandwidths, derived in experiments on noise masking and perception of complex sounds, are often considered as related to the bandwidths of these auditory filters at given center frequencies <ref> [4] </ref>. Early estimates of the critical bandwidth as a function of center frequency indicate a roughly constant value below 500 Hz and a linear increase for higher frequencies, resulting in the common interpretation of the auditory system as a constant-Q filter bank.

Reference-contexts: More recent experiments by Moore and Glasberg suggest that the low-frequency critical bandwidths are quadratically related to the center frequency <ref> [5] </ref>. They provide an expression for the equivalent rectangular bandwidths of the auditory filters that differs somewhat from classical critical band theory; this is shown in Figure 1.
