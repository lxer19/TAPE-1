Title: A TWO-GRID FINITE DIFFERENCE SCHEME FOR NONLINEAR PARABOLIC EQUATIONS  
Author: CLINT N. DAWSON CAROL A. SAN SOUCIE AND MARY F. WHEELER 
Abstract: We present a two level finite difference scheme for the approximation of nonlinear parabolic equations. Discrete inner products and the lowest order Raviart-Thomas approximating space are used in the expanded mixed method in order to develop the finite difference scheme. Analysis of the scheme is given assuming an implicit time discretization. In this two level scheme, the full nonlinear problem is solved on a "coarse" grid of size H: The nonlinearities are expanded about the coarse grid solution and an appropriate interpolation operator is used to provide values of the coarse grid solution on the fine grid in terms of superconvergent node points. The resulting linear but nonsymmetric system is solved on a "fine" grid of size h: Some a priori error estimates are derived which show that the discrete L 1 (L 2 ) and L 2 (H 1 ) errors are O(h 2 + H 4d=2 + t), where d 1 is the spatial dimension. Keywords: error estmates, finite differences, mixed finite elements, nonlinear, superconvergent AMS(MOS) subject classification: 65N06, 65N12, 65N15, 65N22, 65N30 1. Introduction. In this paper, we consider a finite difference approximation scheme

Before we show convergence estimates for this finite difference scheme, we show convergence for a related linear scheme. The arguments given below closely follow those of Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> except that we extend their work to time differenced time dependent problems. Theorem 3.3. <p> Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> present a lemma which gives the desired P fl;n and ~ U fl;n above. <p> We can now extend a corollary from Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> to give: For the ~ U fl;n ; P fl;n ; Z fl;n ; ~ Z fl;n and W fl;n in Lemma 3.4, there exists a constant C, independent of H, such that k ~ U fl;n ~u n k TM CH 2 ; t k TM CH 2 ; <p> K t , the boundedness of K t and the approximation properties of P H , k ~ Z fl;n d t ~ U H k TM C (H 2 + t + k ~ U fl;n ~ U H k T ):(47) By results from Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref>, k ~ U fl;n ~ U n H k T CH 2 . <p> Thus, we know that k ~ U n H k 1 is bounded. Proof. (Of Theorem 3.3) Results (24) and (25) have been proven by Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> These estimates for a full tensor use the inverse estimate and may be improved through the derivation of explicit L 1 estimates. The loss of convergence due to the boundary is shown for the expanded mixed method in <ref> [1] </ref>. The two level scheme described above could be extended by adding more levels and expanding about the next coarser solution in the nonlinear term at each new level. This corresponds to adding more Newton-like iterations with each iteration taking place on the next finer grid.

Reference-contexts: order to prove that F is uniformly monotonic we note that uniform monotoncity is equivalent to positive definiteness of the Jacobian, J = F 0 , and that a real matrix J is positive definite if and only if its symmetric part, (J + J T )=2, is positive definite <ref> [2, Lemma 3.1] </ref>. Furthermore, we know that if a matrix is stricly diagonal dominant with positive diagonal entries, then the eigenvalues of the matrix have positive real parts [2, Theorem 4.9]. <p> Furthermore, we know that if a matrix is stricly diagonal dominant with positive diagonal entries, then the eigenvalues of the matrix have positive real parts <ref> [2, Theorem 4.9] </ref>.
