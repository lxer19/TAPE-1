Abstract: tation of all Fourier transforms of f involves on the order of j G j 2 operations as does direct computation of Fourier inversion. Here fast algorithms are obtained for both operations in the case in which G contains some nontrivial normal subgroup K such that G=K is abelian. Consequently, fast algorithms for computing convolutions on G in this situation are also determined. Under the simplifiying assumption of exponent for matrix multiplication equal to 2 (it is 2.38 as of this writing) it is shown that the number of operations needed to compute all Fourier transforms on G is O( jGj jKj T (K)+ j G j log( jGj where T (K) is the number of operations needed to compute Fourier transforms on K. An analogous result is obtained for Fourier inversion and more careful estimates made for arbitrary exponents of matrix multiplication. In particular, in the case in which G is metabelian (an abelian extension of an abelian subgroup) the assumptions hold and the first large class of noncommutative groups is obtained for which Fourier inversion and the computation of all Fourier transforms may be performed in O(j G j log(j G j)) operations. fl Supported by IBM and NSF Graduate Fellowships.

Reference-contexts: Also, novel applications to the theory of coding, VLSI design and vision are given. Independently, Beth has also made a strong start on fast algorithms for abelian extensions by deriving some speedup in the case of prime extensions. In <ref> [B] </ref> a result like Theorem 1 given here (specialized to this situation) is obtained. Clausen also derives speedups for the general computation of Fourier transforms as well as in the specific case of S n ([C1], [C2]).

Reference-contexts: That is, given a subgroup H of G and a representation of G we obtain a representation of H by restricting to H. This is denoted ( # H). Clearly, this too is a transitive operation. Induction and restriction are related by Frobenius reciprocity. Theorem (Frobenius reciprocity, <ref> [Co] </ref>, Theorem 6) Let be a represen tation of H and a representation of G. Then, h ( " G); i = h; ( # H)i: When restricted to subgroups, irreducible representations need not remain irreducible. Frobenius reciprocity is a useful tool in determining the structure of a restricted representation.

Reference-contexts: It is worth mentioning here that in practice the exponent for matrix multiplication, ff, is 3. There is active research in pursuing what is thought to be the theoretical limit of ff = 2. Currently, the best theoretical result is ff = 2:38 (see <ref> [CW] </ref>). It is straightforward to carry through the preceding analysis using assumptions like ff = 2+* or assuming that d 2 log d operations are needed to multiply d by d matrices. 28 5. Examples To illustrate the methods presented in section 4 two examples are worked out here.

Reference-contexts: The problem for general finite groups has only recently begun to attract attention. In the most general setting, in joint work with Diaconis ([DR]), prompted by the study of spectral analysis for finite groups ([D1], <ref> [D2] </ref>), an algorithm for efficient computation of Fourier transforms for arbitrary groups has already been presented.

Reference-contexts: Dia-conis (<ref> [D3] </ref>) gives an in-depth analysis of the expected and average running times of several different common versions of the FFT concluding, Theorem ((2.8), [D3]) T (C n ) = O (n log n) where the O-notation indicates some universal constant. Consequently, using (1.2), the same is true for I (C n ). Any abelian group is the product of cyclic groups, thus Corollary (FFT) Let G be any finite abelian group.

Reference-contexts: This is in fact the idea at the heart of many of the fast algorithms in the abelian case. The efficacy of the methods in <ref> [DR] </ref> depends strongly on the exponent of matrix multiplication and the existence of representations of G which "split" when restricted down a given tower of subgroups of G. <p> In general there is no such structure and new methods must be developed. In this paper the case of solvable groups is considered, and more generally, the case of abelian group extensions. Here, modifications of the ideas in <ref> [DR] </ref> combined with the use of induced and projective representations yield fast algorithms for both Fourier inversion and computing Fourier transforms. One main result is Theorem 1 Let G be a finite group containing K as a normal subgroup with quotient G=K an abelian group. <p> Here methods depending on K are to be used. In some sense, the earlier research in general FFT's had "predicted" the existence of fast algorithms for abelian extensions. For example, in <ref> [DR] </ref> it is shown that if G is a solvable group, then T (G) is essentially j G j log (j G j). <p> However, this assumes that a basis for the irreducible representations of G can be found with certain "splitting" properties with respect to a maximally refined tower of subgroups of G (Proposition 2, <ref> [DR] </ref>). In the present paper this prediction is realized, albeit by slightly different techniques. On the other hand up to now little has been said about computing Fourier inversion. The ideas presented here for computing Fourier transforms admit modifications allowing fast computation of Fourier inversion. <p> Note that here, even though H need not be abelian, fast algorithms for computing Fourier transforms on H may exist. In particular, methods suggested in <ref> [DR] </ref> may prove useful. 41 Now, for each i and step (b) must be performed. As (fi ;i # K) is diagonal the matrix multiplication here takes d 2 fi ;i operations. So, in total an additional j K jj G j operations will be needed. <p> In a particular case of interest, B n = S n n (Z=2Z) n , use of the ideas in <ref> [DR] </ref> gives an algorithm for T (S n ) which has a running time crudely bounded by O ((n!) 3=2 ).

Reference-contexts: In particular, for the 1 symmetric group S n this situation exists and practical implementations for analyzing ranked data are possible and useful ([R1]). Fourier analysis is also useful in the study of random walks on groups. ([D2], <ref> [DS] </ref>). A probability measure defined on the group gives rise to a random walk on the group. Explicit knowledge of the matrices for the Fourier transforms determined by the measure are useful in studying the rate at which the walk becomes random.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, I (G) is bounded by the same sum but with I (K) replacing T (K). In Theorem 1 ff denotes the exponent of matrix multiplication, (currently 2.38, see <ref> [W] </ref>). It is useful to point out that under the simplifying assumption of ff = 2 the bounds becomes T (G) = j K j j G j )) I (G) = j K j j G j )) with the O-notation as in Theorem 1.
