Abstract: parallel architecture. In both cases, the efforts require general-purpose computers over high-speed and as a result, many large applications have never been networks, and by an implementation methodology specific and system-specific code. We illustrate What we need are parallel architectures and these points using our experience with parallelizing programming tools to provide direct and general three real-world applications. The success in these
