Title: Some Problems (And A Few Solutions) For Open-Ended Evolutionary Robotics

Abstract: Many of the techniques commonly used to evolve neural networks for robots face various problems if the size and morphology of these networks are allowed to vary under evolutionary control. This paper identifies some of these problems for commonly used encoding schemes, neural networks, genetic operators and evaluation techniques and proposes some new techniques that may be used to alleviate them. Results from experiments are reported in which these new techniques were combined for the open-ended evolution of a many-faceted robot behaviour.

Reference-contexts: Cliff, Harvey and Husbands suggest as a solution using a mixture of absolute and relative addressing <ref> [1] </ref>, but this is still subject to similar problems. Others have tried to avoid the issue altogether by introducing mechanisms that allow the size of the network to vary while keeping the size of the genotype fixed [12, 2].

Reference-contexts: of the demands placed on neuron functionality by robot control. 4 Genetic operator problems For many who use genetic algorithms on more traditional optimization problems, the process of artificial evolution occurs as an initially random population converges upon a solution, gradually decreasing the genetic diversity until an equilibrium is reached <ref> [4] </ref>. At this point, it is assumed that no significant change will occur and the process, for all practical purposes, is finished. The situation is made more complex,however, if genotypes are allowed to grow and vary in size. <p> In the context of a converged population, the role of the crossover operator is unclear. Although it may on occasion combine useful `building blocks' and schemas <ref> [4] </ref> from two parent genotypes in the same offspring genotype, the fact that all individuals within the population are very similar means that this will not occur often enough to play a major role.

Reference-contexts: This is because there is always the possibility that significant change can occur after the rate of genetic convergence has dropped to zero. Harvey has suggested that it is only after this initial convergence phase that the real business of open-ended artificial evolution may begin <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. Genetic operators should therefore be such that even after convergence has stabilised there is sufficient generation of new genetic material to ensure the adaptive abilities of the evolutionary process. In the context of a converged population, the role of the crossover operator is unclear.

Reference-contexts: A diagram of this extended T-maze environment is given in figure 2, and two successful paths through this environment are also shown. To achieve maximum fitness points, controllers had to guide a Khepera robot <ref> [15] </ref> down the stem of a T-maze, passing through a beam of light shining from one of the two sides chosen at random. <p> It now performs the full task. A spatially determined encoding scheme, as outlined in Section 2, was used in the experiments. Of the 8 ambient light sensors and 8 IR sensors available on a Khepera <ref> [15] </ref>, only the front 6 of each were made available for use by evolving networks. All sensor values were normalized to lie within the region 0 1.
