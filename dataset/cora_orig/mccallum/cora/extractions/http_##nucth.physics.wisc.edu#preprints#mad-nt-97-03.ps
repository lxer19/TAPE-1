Abstract: Eigen-channel approach to heavy-ion fusion reactions is exact only when the excitation energy of the intrinsic motion is zero. In order to take into account effects of finite excitation energy, we introduce an energy dependence to weight factors in the eigen-channel approximation. Using two channel problem, we show that the weight factors are slowly changing functions of incident energy. This suggests that the concept of the fusion barrier distribution still holds to a good approximation even when the excitation energy of the intrinsic motion is finite. A transition to the adiabatic tunneling, where the coupling leads to a static potential renormalization, is also discussed.

Reference-contexts: PACS number (s): 25.70.Jj, 24.10.Eq 1 It has been well recognized that cross sections of heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies near and below the Coulomb barrier are strongly influenced by coupling of the relative motion of the colliding nuclei to nuclear intrinsic motions <ref> [1] </ref>. When the intrinsic degree of freedom has a degenerate spectrum, fusion cross sections can be calculated in the sudden approximation. In this limit, the coupling gives rise to a distribution of fusion potentials.

Since the weight factors have to satisfy the unitarity condition <ref> [3] </ref>, they can be uniquely determined in the present two level problem, and are given by v + (E) = (P (E)P (E))=(P + (E)P (E)); v (E) = (P + (E)P (E))=(P + (E)P (E)): We performed coupled-channels calculations to examine the energy dependence of the weight factors.

Reference-contexts: To address this problem, one may attempt to use the constant coupling approximation, where the coupling form factor is assumed to be constant throughout the interaction range <ref> [10] </ref>. In this approximation, the unitary transformation gives the fusion cross section as a sum of eigen-channel cross sections. The constant coupling approximation has, however, a serious drawback in that the results strongly depend on the position where the strength of the coupling Hamiltonian is evaluated. <p> An approximation which is often made is to assume that the coupling form factor F (R) is a constant. In this approximation, the unitary matrix becomes independent of R, and the penetrability is given by a formula similar to eq. (2) but with different eigen-values and weight factors <ref> [10] </ref>. In order to take into account the radial dependence of the coupling form factor, an approximation was proposed, where the coupling matrix is diagonalized to obtain the eigen-barriers at each position of the relative motion R while the weight factors are calculated at a chosen position R w [13]. <p> In order to avoid this, we use here a schematic model of heavy-ion fusion reactions by Dasso et al.<ref> [10] </ref>, where the radial motion between colliding nuclei is treated as a one dimensional barrier penetration problem. Following ref. [10], we assume the gaussian shape for both the bare potential and the coupling form factor, U (R) = U 0 e R 2 =2s 2 R 2 =2s 2 The parameters are chosen following ref. [10] to be U 0 = 100 MeV, F 0 = 3 MeV, and s <p> Following ref. <ref> [10] </ref>, we assume the gaussian shape for both the bare potential and the coupling form factor, U (R) = U 0 e R 2 =2s 2 R 2 =2s 2 The parameters are chosen following ref. [10] to be U 0 = 100 MeV, F 0 = 3 MeV, and s = s f = 3 fm, respectively, which mimic the fusion reaction between two 58 Ni nuclei. <p> When the constant coupling approximation was first introduced, it was expected that the choice of the position where the weight factors are estimated is not critical to calculate tunneling probabilities because the weight factors vary slowly across the barrier region <ref> [10, 13] </ref>. The position was then chosen to be the barrier position of the uncoupled barrier. Contrary to this expectation, our calculations show that determining the weight factors at the barrier position does not give proper weight factors even though the weight factors do not have a strong radial dependence.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, one needs to use a different approach to address the question. In this paper we treat the weight factors as energy dependent variables. The possibility of the energy dependence of weight factors when the excitation energy is finite has been suggested in ref. <ref> [11] </ref>. Here, we explicitly study the energy dependence by performing exact coupled-channels calculations. It will be shown that the energy dependence is quite weak for a wide range of excitation energy, suggesting that the eigen-channel approximation works well even when the excitation energy of the intrinsic motion is not small. <p> The situation would be much more serious in realistic calculations, since the weights are still changing at the barrier position due to the fact that the coupling extends outside the Coulomb barrier <ref> [11] </ref>. The same calculations were repeated for different values of the excitation energy * and the results are shown in Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with the adiabatic picture, i.e. the main effect of the coupling to a state whose excitation energy is much larger the barrier curvature is to introduce an energy independent shift of the potential accompanied with the mass renormalization <ref> [12, 16] </ref>. Correspondingly, the barrier distribution is only shifted without significantly changing its shape unless the coupling form factor has a strong radial dependence [17].

Reference-contexts: To this end, the coupled-channels equations have to be solved with good accuracy, since the penetrabilities P (E) and P (E) in eq. (5) are exponentially small quantities at energies below the barrier. The incoming wave boundary condition, which is often used in coupled channels calculations for heavy-ion collisions <ref> [15] </ref>, can bring some numerical errors, though they would be small enough for the purpose of calculating fusion cross sections.

Reference-contexts: Correspondingly, the barrier distribution is only shifted without significantly changing its shape unless the coupling form factor has a strong radial dependence <ref> [17] </ref>. It is thus clear that the second derivative of E can represent a wide range of situations between the two extreme limits, i.e. from the adiabatic limit where the coupling leads to an adiabatic potential renormalization, to the sudden limit where the coupling gives rise to a barrier distribution.
