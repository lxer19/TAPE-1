Abstract: proposed hardware. This is a non-trivial task, The goal of our research effort is to develop with many real-world complexities, and as such generic technology for intelligent automated it offers several advantages. It pushes research agents in simulation environments. These agents based on real-world needs on topics such as are to behave believably like humans in these reactivity, real-time reasoning, planning, environments. In this context, believability episodic memory, agent modeling, temporal refers to the indistinguishability of these agents reasoning, explanation, and natural language from humans, given the task being performed, understanding/generation. Furthermore, it its scope, and the allowable mode(s) of forces the integration of all of these component interaction during task performance. For AI technologies, because it requires a single instance, for a given simulation task, one automated agent to perform all of the functions allowable mode of interaction with an agent may performed by a pilot in air combat. be typewritten questions and answers on a Simultaneously, however, as a simulation task, it limited subject matter. Alternatively, a different delimits the component technologies to be allowable mode of interaction for the same (or integrated. For example, it does not force the different) task may be speech rather than integration of vision or locomotion components. typewritten words. In all these cases, Finally, the task also imposes external metrics believability implies that the agent must be for success. indistinguishable from a human, given the particular mode of interaction. Such an agent The task also poses an important constraint: technology can potentially provide virtual the automated agents must believably act and humans for the multitude of virtual reality react like trained human pilots. These agents are environments under construction. Its to take part in exercises with other human pilots. applications can be found in many fields, If human trainees identify our agents as including entertainment [1], education [5, automated pilots, they may take advantage of chapter 3], and training [2]. specific known characteristics of their behavior. Training in such a situation could actually be To begin this effort, we have focused on harmful. For instance, if the automated agents creating specific automated agents for simulated do not react as quickly as other human pilots (or tactical air combat. The automated agents act as react too quickly), trainees may learn to act too the virtual pilots for simulated aircraft, and will aggressively (or not aggressively enough) in a participate in exercises with real Navy pilots. real aerial combat. Additionally, if the agents These exercises will aid in training Navy pilots,
