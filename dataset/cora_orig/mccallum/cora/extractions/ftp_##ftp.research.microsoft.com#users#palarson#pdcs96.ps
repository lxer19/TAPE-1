Abstract: A multidatabase system (MDBS) integrates information from autonomous pre-existing local databases managed by heterogeneous local database management systems in a distributed environment. To achieve good overall system performance, efficient global query processing and optimization techniques are required in the MDBS. In this paper, several new techniques such as query sampling, query probing, and piggybacking are introduced. These techniques were designed for an MDBS called the CORDS Multidatabase System. The paper gives an overview of the global query optimizer in the system, including its architecture and some critical implementation techniques.

Reference-contexts: Currently, three types of local DBSs are supported, i.e., relational, hierarchical and network. There are a number of other modules in the CORDS-MDBS including schema integration, global transaction management, and communication client/server libraries. Their discussion can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.3 Modules in the Global Query Optim izer The global query optimizer is a major subsystem of the CORDS-MDBS. It consists of several smaller modules (see Figure 3). It performs query optimization to generate a good execution plan for a query at compile time.

Reference-contexts: In an MDBS, there is less freedom for the global query optimizer to decide where to transfer data to and where to perform an operation. Among the above challenges, the first challenge is crucial. Recently, several researchers have investigated this issue. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Du et al. proposed a calibration method to deduce necessary local information. The idea is to construct a special local synthetic calibrating database and then run a set of special queries against this database.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments [10; 11] on three commercial DBMSs (ORACLE, DB2/6000 and EMPRESS) demonstrated that the query sampling method is quite promising in estimating local cost parameters in an MDBS. Although a number of sampling techniques have been applied to query optimization in the literature <ref> [4; 6; 7] </ref> , all of them perform data sampling (i.e., sampling data from databases) instead of query sampling (i.e., sampling queries from a query class).

Reference-contexts: However, distributed database systems were designed for a homogeneous environment; for instance, all sites use the same data model. Local autonomy was not emphasized in such systems. Therefore, although global query optimization in an MDBS has some similarit-ies to that in a traditional DDBS, there are some new challenges <ref> [5; 8; 9] </ref> : (a) Some local information needed for global query optimization, such as local cost parameters, may not be available at the global level. Because of local autonomy, a local DBS may not expose all its information at the global level.
