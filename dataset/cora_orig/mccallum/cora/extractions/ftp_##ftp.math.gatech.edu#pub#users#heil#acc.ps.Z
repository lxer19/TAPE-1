Abstract: Christopher Heil 1;? , Gilbert Strang 2 , Vasily Strela 3 1 School of Mathematics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0160, USA (heil@math.gatech.edu) 2 Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA (gs@math.mit.edu) 3 Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, Received August 31, 1994 / Revised version received May 2, 1995 Summary. The functions f 1 (x); : : : ; f r (x) are refinable if they are combinations of the rescaled and translated functions f i (2x k). This is very common in scientific computing on a regular mesh. The space V 0 of approximating functions with meshwidth h = 1 is a subspace of V 1 with meshwidth h = 1=2. These refinable spaces have refinable basis functions. The accuracy of the computations depends on p, the order of approximation, which is determined by the degree of polynomials 1; x; : : : ; x p1 that lie in V 0 . Most refinable functions (such as scaling functions in the theory of wavelets) have no simple formulas. The functions f i (x) are known only through the coefficients c k in the refinement equation|scalars in the traditional case, rfir matrices for multiwavelets. The scalar "sum rules" that determine p are well known. We find the conditions on the matrices c k that yield approximation of order p from V 0 . These are equivalent to the Strang-Fix conditions on the Fourier transforms

Reference-contexts: By periodicity this is M (). Then the pth order zero of M produces the pth order zeros of ^ f required in (4). The matrix case is not so straightforward. Equation (5) still leads to the infinite product in (6), but convergence for all ! is not automatic <ref> [HC] </ref>. (Equation (3) does not become M (0) = identity matrix; we can only expect that an eigenvalue of M (0) equals one.) Condition (4) is changed and therefore condition (7) must change. <p> Assume now that an integrable scaling function f is given which has accuracy p. (Existence and uniqueness of solutions to matrix refinement equations is considered in <ref> [HC] </ref>.) Integrability implies compact support; in fact, supp (f ) [0; N ]. Accuracy p says there are row vectors y (j) k (each of length r) such that (14) k (j) 82 C. Heil et al. for each j = 0; : : : ; p 1. <p> Hypothesis (H1) is the natural extension to the matrix case of the scalar requirement (3) that P c k = 2, i.e., = M (0) = 1. (H1) implies that the infinite matrix product Q 1 j=1 M (!=2 j ) converges uniformly on compact sets to a continuous function <ref> [HC] </ref>. This means that ^ f is determined, just as in the scalar case (6), by this infinite product: 92 C. Heil et al. ^ f (!) = j=1 Note then that ^ f (0) = 1 ^ f (0). <p> This ensures that at most one integrable solution to the matrix refinement equation can exist up to normalization by scalar multiples|in other words, f is unique <ref> [HC] </ref>. Thus (H1) and (H2) together simply state that 1 is a simple eigenvalue for and all other eigenvalues are less than 1 in absolute value. Hypotheses (H1) and (H2) are tied to the constant C as follows.

Reference-contexts: We proceed by induction. For j = 0, (19) and (20) give G 0 (x + 1) = G 0 (x) and G 0 (x) = G 0 (2x). The mapping t x = 2x mod 1 from [0; 1) onto itself is ergodic. Therefore, the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem <ref> [Wal, Theorem 1.14] </ref> implies that there is a constant C such that (21) G 0 (x) = n k=0 Hence G 0 (x) = C a.e. Our independence assumption implies that C 6= 0.
