Reference-contexts: We describe here an approach based on the Laplacian operator that has a firm theoretical foundation adn which is relatively inexpensive to compute. Haralick <ref> [ Haralick and Shapiro, 1992 ] </ref> describes how the facet model approach can be used to recover ridges and ravines.

Reference-contexts: A more recent technique related to our approach is that proposed by Gauch and Pizer <ref> [ R and Pizer, 1993 ] </ref> . In their approach, they find places where the intensity falls off sharply in two opposite directions. They determine curvature extrema of the level curves of the image in order to achieve this.
