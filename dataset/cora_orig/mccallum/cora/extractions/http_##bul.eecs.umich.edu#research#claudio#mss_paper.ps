Abstract: Mean Scatterer Spacing (MSS) has been recognized to be a useful tool for tissue characterization. Most of the work in this area either uses the amplitude or the phase information of the spectrum of the backscattered ultrasound echo to estimate the MSS. Simulations have shown that the latter approach is more robust in the presence of irregularities in the scatterer distribution. However, most of the algorithms based on the phase information of the spectrum are computationally demanding and cannot be used in real-time. We present a computationally efficient and robust algorithm which uses the magnitude and phase information of the spectrum to estimate the MSS. This algorithm exploits the spectral redundancy present in the backscattered echo signal by generating spectral lines through a non-linear (quadratic) transformation of the RF echo signal. Results of simulations comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and previous approaches from the literature are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Experiments involving phantoms and in vitro tissue samples are also presented. The feasibility of implementing a real-time MSS imaging system based on the proposed method is discussed.

Reference-contexts: In the case of non-invasive temperature change estimation using diagnostic ultrasound, local MSS in a short window is estimated and changes due to heating are observed. Seip and Ebbini observed these changes and modeled it as a consequence of the local change in speed of sound and thermal expansion <ref> [2] </ref>. There are some fundamental differences between the non-invasive temperature estimation and the tissue characterization applications of MSS. For tissue characterization applications one is interested in estimating an overall MSS for a whole volume of tissue, and using this measure to assess tissue properties in that region.

When the SNR rd is low, it has been observed that the model order has to be larger than the corresponding average spacing between scatterers <ref> [5; 13] </ref>. Therefore, when a relatively large MSS dynamic range is assumed, a large model order has to be chosen.

Reference-contexts: B. Cyclostationarity A signal x (t) is said to be second-order cyclostationary if and only if it is possible to find a second-order nonlinear transformation of the signal that will generate finite-strength additive sine-wave components, which result in spectral lines <ref> [12] </ref>. The most general time-invariant quadratic transformation is a linear combination of delay products: y (t) = x (t)h (o )x (t o )do; (18) where h (t) is some weighting function. <p> In this case, the above transformation simplifies to: y (t) = x 2 (t); (20) namely the square of the RF echo signal. Many manmade signals and some natural signals present second-order cyclostationarity, although the line components are not present in the original spectra. Gardner <ref> [12] </ref> presents several illustrative examples of the use of non-linear transformations in the area of Communications, where signals have an embedded periodicity. <p> It should be noted that for some special cases, the particular transformation (20) may not lead to a finite-strength additive sine-wave component (for instance <ref> [12, Example 2, pp. 38-40] </ref>). Nevertheless, our observations show that in the case of simulated and experimental ultrasound echo data, the above transformation will likely lead to the generation of a spectral line. <p> This method uses the phase information of the spectrum of the echo, 6 F (x (t)), together with the magnitude information, jF (x (t))j, to extract a more reliable peak. As explained in detail by Gard-ner in the area of Communications <ref> [12] </ref>, it is possible to exploit the spectral redundancy present in a cyclostationary signal, by using a quadratic transformation of the signal. In practice, the proposed algorithm can be implemented through an FFT with zero-padding for obtaining a finer interpolation of the spectrum.

Phantom Experiment A new method for building ultrasonic phantoms that allows for the precise placement of digital scatterers has been recently suggested by Phillips and Parker <ref> [14] </ref>. A two dimensional scatterer distribution is printed on a conventional overhead transparency using a laser printer. The transparency is immersed in de-gassed water and imaged with a conventional ultrasonic imaging equipment. The transducer is placed in direct contact with the water surface, imaging the plane of the transparency.

Reference-contexts: B-scan image of the pig liver (40 dB dynamic range). is responsible for the regular scatterers present in the ultrasonic image. In the pig, differently from the human and cow liver, there is connective tissue separating each lobule from its neighbors <ref> [15] </ref>. Consequently, it is much easier to visually identify the histologic structure in the pig liver, therefore being chosen for this preliminary study. A freshly excised pig liver sample was immersed in water and imaged using the imaging system described above.

Reference-contexts: Gray-scale image of MSS estimates for the pig liver. V. Discussion Two different types of errors occur when estimating the MSS using the proposed technique: (1) small errors in the MSS estimate (called jitter, in analogy to the terminology used in <ref> [19] </ref>) that occur when the first harmonic peak is shifted due to irregularities in the regular lattice of scat-terers, or noise (diffuse scatterers, electronic noise, etc.); (2) large errors caused by a false peak in the spectrum being detected instead of the actual first harmonic peak.
