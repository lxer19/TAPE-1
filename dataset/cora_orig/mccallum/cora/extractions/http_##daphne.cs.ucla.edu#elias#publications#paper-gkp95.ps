Abstract: We consider the special case of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in which the distance metric is the shortest-path metric of a planar unweighted graph. We present a polynomial-time approxima tion scheme (PTAS) for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Approximability was no exception: The TSP was shown early to be non-approximable in its general case, and the 3=2 approximation algorithm for the triangle inequality case due to Christofides <ref> [2] </ref> is well-known. It has been open for two decades whether this bound can be improved, even in two important special cases: The Euclidean TSP, and the graph TSP |in the latter the distance metric is the shortest-path metric of an unweighted graph.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traveling salesman problem <ref> [5] </ref> (TSP) has been the testbed of every new algorithmic idea during the past half-century: linear programming, cutting planes and polyhedral combinatorics, probabilistic algorithms, local search (and more recently Boltzmann machines, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and neural nets), dynamic programming, Lagrangean relaxation, even NP-completeness.

Reference-contexts: Consider the f =2 largest faces of the given planar graph G, and triangulate them (each from a vertex). We now have a planar graph with largest face d = O (n=f ). According to Miller's planar separator theorem <ref> [9] </ref> (Theorem 3.2), there is a simple cycle of length p p f ) that separates G into two graphs with no more than 2n=3 nodes each. <p> The theorem and its proof are closely related to the following <ref> [9] </ref> (also [4]): Theorem 3.2 (Miller) Let G be a weighted 2-connected planar graph with maximum face size d. <p> If we only consider the faces (the even levels), the labeling mimics a BFS from f 0 where faces are "adjacent" iff they share a vertex, as done in <ref> [9] </ref>. t t fi S D ffi ffi S 2 (i + 1) Consider an edge e in G. It has two vertices v 1 , v 2 and two faces f 1 , f 2 . <p> This tree pruning is done as shown by Miller <ref> [9] </ref>. If any of these F-cycles is a separator, then we are done. So for the remainder of the proof, assume that F has exterior weight greater than 2=3, and each L j has interior weight greater than 2=3. <p> Under these conditions, a simplified version of Theorem 5 from <ref> [9] </ref> shows that some induced cycle C of T is a simple cycle separator for G 00 , and hence (by the choice of weights) also a V-cycle separator of G.

Reference-contexts: It was shown in [11] that another special case, in which all distances are either one or two (1-2 TSP), can be approximated within 7=6, and also that it is MAXSNP-hard <ref> [10] </ref> (and, as it easily follows from the proof, so is the graph TSP). It has also been open whether the Euclidean TSP is MAXSNP-hard 1 . The current work was motivated by unsuccessful attempts to prove that it is.
