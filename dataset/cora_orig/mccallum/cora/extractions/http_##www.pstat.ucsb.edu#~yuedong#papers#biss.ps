Reference-contexts: We have ignored the pulses since we are interested in the association between circadian rhythms. We will investigate the associations of the baselines and the pulses simultaneously in our future research. Our first step is to develop a method to estimate the baseline and pulses jointly <ref> (Guo, Wang and Brown 1997) </ref>. 14 7 Appendix Proof of Lemma 1 Let f (t) = (f 1 (t 11 ); ; f 1 (t 1n 1 ); f 2 (t 21 ); ; f 2 (t 2n 2 )) and ^ f fig (t) = (f 1 (t 11 );

Reference-contexts: Our proposed methods show that 2 extensions of the spline models are just as easy and natural. Another interesting application of our model is the problem of combining data from multiple sources <ref> (Myers 1991, Gao 1994) </ref>. This problem arises in meteorology where one attribute such as rainfall is measured by several different methods such as rain gauges and radar. We want to combine these measurements to provide more precise measurements or predictions. For simplicity we use cubic spline notations in this paper.

Reference-contexts: W 2 = ff : f; f 0 absolutely continuous, Z 1 (f 00 (t)) 2 dt &lt; 1g: Our methods can be easily extended to the general smoothing spline models where the two domains are arbitrary (thus could be different) and the observations are linear functionals instead of evaluations <ref> (Wahba 1990, Wahba 1992) </ref>. 3 2.2 Estimation of the Nonparametric Functions Denote t k = (t k1 ; ; t kn k ) T , f k = (f k1 ; ; f kn k ) T , y k = (y k1 ; ; y kn k ) T , <p> That is, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the separately estimated parameters minus the asymptotic covariance matrix of the jointly estimated parameters is positive semi-definite (Zellner 1962, Gallant 1975). In the smoothing spline context the posterior covariances are often used to construct Bayesian confidence intervals <ref> (Wahba 1990) </ref>. In this subsection we show that the covariance matrix of the separately estimated functions minus the covariance matrix (12) of the jointly estimated functions is positive semi-definite. For simplicity we assume that there are no missing data and t 1 = t 2 in this subsection. <p> It is known that lim a!1 A a ~ ^ f k = lim a!1 A a k y k = lim a!1 E (F k jy k ) <ref> (Wahba 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: second row criteria scores are plotted as functions of r and with two smoothing parameters fixed at log 10 1 = log 10 2 = 4. 4 Smoothing Spline ANOVA Decompositions and Hy- pothesis Tests Smoothing spline ANOVA (SS ANOVA) is an extension of the classical ANOVA to functional space <ref> (Wahba, Wang, Gu, Klein and Klein 1995) </ref>. They are used to build models for multivariate functions. In this section we derive a SS ANOVA decomposition of the functions f k (t) and discuss some interesting hypothesis tests.

Reference-contexts: Box and Draper (1965) developed a determinant criterion based on a Bayesian argument for mul-tiresponse data. They showed that combining information from several responses provides more precise estimates of the parameters. In applications such as data measuring hormone concentrations in plasma <ref> (Wang and Brown 1996) </ref> it is difficult to assume specific forms for the regression functions. Therefore the less assumptions made on these functions the better. Nonparametric regression models, especially smoothing splines, provide powerful tools to model these functions. Many authors considered nonparametric models for multiresponse data. <p> When the covariance matrix is known, a simple transformation can be used. Therefore the existing methods can be easily modified for calculation. When the covariance matrix is unknown, it has to be estimated from the data and can affect the estimates of the smoothing parameters <ref> (Wang 1996) </ref>. In this paper we assume that the covariance parameters are unknown. We use penalized weighted least-squares to estimate the nonparametric functions. It is shown that these penalized weighted least-squares estimates are more efficient than function-by-function estimates. <p> The minimizers of M ( 1 ; 2 ; r; ) are called GML estimates. We call this method the GML method. The GML estimate of is ^ = n 4 z T (Q T n 4 A direct extension of the GCV function is <ref> (Wang 1996) </ref> V ( 1 ; 2 ; r; ) = [Tr (W (I A))] 2 = 2 BQ 2 ) 2 z 2 BQ 2 ) 1 ] 2 : (14) The minimizers of V ( 1 ; 2 ; r; ) are called GCV estimates.

Reference-contexts: For parametric models it is well-known that the joint estimates are more efficient than function-by-function estimates. That is, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the separately estimated parameters minus the asymptotic covariance matrix of the jointly estimated parameters is positive semi-definite <ref> (Zellner 1962, Gallant 1975) </ref>. In the smoothing spline context the posterior covariances are often used to construct Bayesian confidence intervals (Wahba 1990). In this subsection we show that the covariance matrix of the separately estimated functions minus the covariance matrix (12) of the jointly estimated functions is positive semi-definite.
