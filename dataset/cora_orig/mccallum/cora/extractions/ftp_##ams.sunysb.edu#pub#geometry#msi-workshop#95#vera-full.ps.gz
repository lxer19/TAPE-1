Title: Quality pictures  
Author: Gregoria Blanco Jesus Garca Lopez Ferran Hurtado Pedro Ramos Vera Sacristan 
Abstract: We present the first part of a study on what we call quality pictures, where we introduce a quality parameter ff that indicates the minimum incidence angle allowed between the vision direction and a seen surface. We solve here some combinatorial and algorithmic problems about both external and internal quality pictures of polygons.

Reference-contexts: Proof: A complete proof of this theorem can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The essential steps are: First notice that the algorithm must find a minimal ff-cover of P , i.e. a minimal set of polygonal subchains of P such that 1. each chain can appear in a single picture from R with quality ff and 2. the chains cover P . <p> Finally, we study simple polygons, where external and internal quality picture problems become very similar, and the previous algorithms can be re-adapted into new O (n 2 ) time ones. These and some other related problems can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], in which we generalize these questions to the 3D space, taking quality pictures of terrains and polyhedra from restricted zones or trajectories in space. 10

Reference-contexts: One can decide if Q R by computing the convex hull of Q and deciding whether it is contained in R or not. This process takes O (n + m) time ([9], <ref> [12] </ref>, [14]). Another option is to determine for each i whether the point q i is interior or not to R in O (log m) time.

Reference-contexts: As P 0 has 2n vertices, it can be triangulated either in O (n) or O (n log n) time. The shortest path between two vertices of a triangulated polygon can be obtained in O (n) time ([10], <ref> [17] </ref>), and n of these paths are to be calculated. Finally, step 6 just requires linear time. A small modification of this algorithm allows to calculate the maximum quality in the ex ternal vision of simple polygons.
