Title: Arbitrary Size Benes Networks  
Author: Chihming Chang and Rami Melhem 
Affiliation: University of Pittsburgh Department of Computer Science  
Abstract: The Benes network is a rearrangeable nonblocking network which can realize any arbitrary permutation. Overall, the r-dimensional Benes network connects 2 r inputs to 2 r outputs through 2r 1 levels of 2 fi 2 switches. Each level of switches consists of 2 r1 switches, and hence the size of the network has to be a power of two. In this paper, we extend Benes networks to arbitrary sizes. We also show that the looping routing algorithm used in Benes networks can be slightly modified and applied to arbitrary size Benes networks.

Reference-contexts: However, if the connections in a permutation are established in the network sequentially, the establishment of a connection may require rearranging the existing connections. A network which can handle all possible permutations without rearranging connections is a nonblocking network [3]. The Benes network <ref> [1] </ref>, which is a special instance of CLOS networks [2], is an excellent example of a rearrangeable network. Overall, the r-dimensional Benes network has 2r 1 levels of switches, with 2 r1 switches in each level. Figure 1 shows the Benes network with r = 3. <p> Given any one-to-one mapping, , of 2 r inputs to 2 r outputs, there is a set of edge- disjoint paths from the inputs of an r-dimensional Benes network to its outputs connecting input i to output (i) for 0 i 2 r 1 <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. The Benes topology is specified such that the number of input or output terminals has to be a power of 2. In practical terms, this is a severe restriction on the sizes of systems that will use the network.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present a constructive way of building an arbitrary size Benes network (AS-Benes) for any number of terminals. The routing algorithm presented for the AS-Benes is nearly as simple as the looping algorithm for the regular Benes network <ref> [5] </ref>. 1 2 Construction Strategy Multistage interconnection networks are usually constructed from a single type of modular switching elements.
