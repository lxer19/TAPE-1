Abstract: This paper describes the control architecture, the main issues, and the features of the Teleoperationsystem TELOS, as well as the main future research areas. The TELOS Teleoperationsystem allows human supervisory of remote teleoperators even in a time delayed environment. The operation concept defines two main phases. The first phase is either an automatic or operator driven "preparation" phase. It includes offline, model-based planning facilities as well as sensorsimulation tools to prepare telerobot activities in the fields of servicing or assembly. These facilities are developed and integrated for best operator support during telerobot activity preparation and for the prediction of sensor values, which are necessary to integrate control methods for the remote telerobot. The preparation phase integrates real-time simulation on 3D computer graphics for operator-based telerobot programming and visual verification of the telerobot operation sequences. This leads to proved, robust operation sequences, too. The second main phase of the operation concept is the "execution" phase, with automatic robot action execution on a sensor-based telerobot, and if required, operator support during exception diagnosis and recovery. The semiautonomous telerobot execution is monitored by sensor conditions, which are parameterized and initialized during the preparation process.

Reference-contexts: Aspects like human safety, resource efficiency, limited and cost intensive crew availability request to new operation concepts, where "intelligent" sensor-controlled telerobots have to fulfil complex tasks in supervisory control mode, while autonomous systems are not able to perform the processes reliable enough <ref> [1] </ref>. Autonomy becomes very costly in situations where the environment is only partially known and significant, sensing and control errors exist [2].

Reference-contexts: Autonomy becomes very costly in situations where the environment is only partially known and significant, sensing and control errors exist <ref> [2] </ref>. To build reliable and flexible systems for teleoperation consequently an operator has to be placed into the control loop especially in situations, where the flexibility and cognitive capabilities of a human are necessary to support the telerobot system. Several teleoperation systems have been developed in the past. <p> These systems only interact with the human operator when they encounters situations they can't handle. Paul proposes a "teleprogramming paradigm" that combines a graphical previewing display with the provision of real-time kinesthetic feedback, which is computed on the basis of the operator's interaction with a simulated robot environment <ref> [2] </ref>. The telerobot in the remote workcell monitors the execution of the instructions and informs the operator on critical situations, when an exception appears. Such developments are often based on the principles of "traded" and "shared" control [7].

Reference-contexts: Several teleoperation systems have been developed in the past. First developments were simple masterslave systems. These systems are often feedback systems with the operator's action, perception and reaction forming a closed loop <ref> [4] </ref>, which tends to destabilize when time delay is greater than 0.3s. In space or under water applications, the transmission time between the local and remote system is more than 1 second, so this methods are no longer valid.

Reference-contexts: In space or under water applications, the transmission time between the local and remote system is more than 1 second, so this methods are no longer valid. New approaches are developed, which use sophisticated techniques to overcome the effect of time delay. They normally work with predictive graphical displays <ref> [5] </ref>, which allow the operator to preview the effects of commanded actions in real-time. Hirzinger [6] includes the time delay into the dynamic model of the environment by using sophisticated estimation schemes. Recent developments try to combine simple autonomous task execution with exception handling features in supervisory control mode.

Reference-contexts: The telerobot in the remote workcell monitors the execution of the instructions and informs the operator on critical situations, when an exception appears. Such developments are often based on the principles of "traded" and "shared" control <ref> [7] </ref>. With the Teleloperationsystem TELOS we build a supervised control telerobot system with automatic or interactive, but world model based telerobot programming capabilities. The system includes higher, implicit programming and control levels of a telerobot architecture as well as the lower robot specific ones.

Reference-contexts: To build a modular, flexible, and open structured control architecture for the TELOS system, we choose as a baseline for the development the Functional Reference Model (FRM), a hierarchical control architecture developed for semi-autonomous telerobotic applications in space <ref> [8] </ref>. The proposed architecture is a four layered control architecture with operator oriented implicit mission, task, and action control levels and an explicit robot and execution oriented control level.

Reference-contexts: The operator controls the process in each phase in the supervisory control mode, where he is able to intervene at any time. In general, we define three main user interaction types for efficient telerobot programming and control <ref> [9] </ref>: 3 Information retrieval and observation Participation for problem solving Control and monitoring The supervisory control and operation concept of TELOS ensures, that robust telerobot actions are prepared and executed reliable in the remote world by the telerobot.

Reference-contexts: This is realised by using predefined action patterns for each task. An action is an elementary telerobot or experiment operation with implicit attributes and parameters. The action language includes sensor based control methods and is designed for the use of force/torque robot controllers <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 A least the actions are mapped one by one to the robot specific Explicit Elementary Operations (EEOs). Each step is supported by a data base, which includes the world model, the language descriptions, the language decomposition structures, the monitor condition and the sensor conditions (Figure 4).

Reference-contexts: These SCs are defined by sensor primitives (SPs), where the sensor primitive concept is based on the logical sensor concept <ref> [11] </ref>. A monitoring process "watch" the automatic execution of the EEOs to detect exceptions.
