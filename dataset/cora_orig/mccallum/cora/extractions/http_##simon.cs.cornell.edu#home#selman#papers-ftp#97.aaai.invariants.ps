Abstract: It is well known that the performance of a stochastic local search procedure depends upon the setting of its noise parameter, and that the optimal setting varies with the problem distribution. It is therefore desirable to develop general priniciples for tuning the procedures. We present two statistical measures of the local search process that allow one to quickly find the optimal noise settings. These properties are independent of the fine details of the local search strategies, and appear to be relatively independent of the structure of the problem domains. We applied these principles to the problem of evaluating new search heuristics, and discovered two promising new strategies.

Reference-contexts: We wanted to make sure that the observed invariant was not simply due to some statistical property of random formulas.) an 18 coloring of a 125-node graph <ref> (Johnson et al. 1991) </ref>. This formula contains 2,250 variables and 70,163 clauses. Because this formula is so large, we could not perform as many runs for each data point as in the previous experiments. Each point is based on just 1,000 samples.

Reference-contexts: After hypothesizing the existence of this invariant based on our study of random formulas, we wished to see whether it also held for classes of real-world, structured satisfiability problems. Figures 3 and 4 present confirming evidence. that encodes a blocks-world planning problem (instance bw large.a, from <ref> (Kautz and Selman 1996) </ref>). The original problem is to find a 6-step plan that solves a planning problem involving 9 blocks, where each step moves a block (i.e., a pickup followed by a putdown).

Reference-contexts: Introduction The performance of a stochastic local search procedure critically depends upon the setting of the noise parameter that determines the likelihood of escaping from local minima by making non-optimal moves. In simulated annealing <ref> (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983, Dowsland 1993) </ref> this is the temperature; in tabu search (Glover 1986, Glover and Laguna 1993), the tenure (the length of time for which a modified variable is tabu); in GSAT (Selman et al. 1992), the random walk parameter; and in WSAT (also called walksat, Sel-man et al.
