Abstract: This paper describes the performance evaluation of six temporal reasoning systems. We show that if you are working with large temporal datasets where information is added incrementally throughout the execution of the program, systems using incompletely connected graphs (i.e., TMM, TimeGraph and TimeGraph-II) seem the best option. While they do not offer the constant query time of systems using fully connected graphs (i.e. the systems based on constraint satisfaction), the savings at assertion time are so substantial that the relatively small performance penalty for queries is a reasonable tradeoff. Of course, these systems do not offer the expressiv - ity of the interval-based systems as they only handle point-based relations. Of the three, TimeGraph-II offers a wider range of qualitative relations as it handles point inequality. It does not currently handle metric information, however, as do TMM and TimeGraph. Thus decisions between these three may be more determined by the reasoning capabilities required rather than raw performance.

Reference-contexts: The six systems studied in this report are TimeLogic [Koomen, 1989], Time- Graph [Miller and Schubert, 1990], MATS [Kautz and Ladkin, 1991; Kautz, 1991], Tachyon <ref> [Arthur and Stillman, 1992] </ref>, TMM [Dean and McDermott, 1987; Schrag et al., 1992], and TimeGraph-II [Gerevini and Schubert, 1993]. These systems differ greatly in their underlying mechanisms and expressive power. <p> Allen constraints are interval-based, while metric constraints are point-based. MATS performs transitive closure computations on intervals for Allen constraints and uses constraint satisfaction for point-based metric reasoning. Tachyon <ref> [Arthur and Stillman, 1992] </ref> can handle both metric information and qualitative information. For the disjoint constraint, it simplifies the problem by just presenting the first solution found.

These systems differ greatly in their underlying mechanisms and expressive power. <p> Another improvement of TimeGraph-II over TimeGraph is that it automatically structures the timegraph for efficiency. Since it uses the timegraph data structure, it also cannot handle disjoint relationship. The current version of TimeGraph-II cannot handle metric information. TMM <ref> [Dean and McDermott, 1987; Schrag et al., 1992] </ref> is a temporal database management system. It uses temporal constraint graph (TCG) data structure to 2 construct a time map with simple point relations (&lt;, =, ).

Reference-contexts: The six systems studied in this report are TimeLogic [Koomen, 1989], Time- Graph [Miller and Schubert, 1990], MATS [Kautz and Ladkin, 1991; Kautz, 1991], Tachyon [Arthur and Stillman, 1992], TMM [Dean and McDermott, 1987; Schrag et al., 1992], and TimeGraph-II <ref> [Gerevini and Schubert, 1993] </ref>. These systems differ greatly in their underlying mechanisms and expressive power. <p> It uses a partial order graph, called timegraph, whose nodes represent time points. Directed links between points indicate relations between the points (&lt; or ). The timegraph is partitioned into chains, with possible links between chains. TimeGraph-II <ref> [Gerevini and Schubert, 1993] </ref>, the successor of TimeGraph, also uses a timegraph data structure. TimeGraph-II supports the full set of point relations (&lt;, =, , 6=). Another improvement of TimeGraph-II over TimeGraph is that it automatically structures the timegraph for efficiency.

These systems differ greatly in their underlying mechanisms and expressive power. <p> In this section, we will look at the details of each system. TimeLogic [Koomen, 1989] is interval-based. It performs transitive closure computations on intervals for qualitative constraints between intervals, using automatically created reference intervals to limit constraint propagations. It cannot handle metric information. MATS <ref> [Kautz, 1991; Kautz and Ladkin, 1991] </ref> is the most complete system integrating both metric (quantitative) and Allen (qualitative) constraints, including the disjoint constraint. Allen constraints are interval-based, while metric constraints are point-based. MATS performs transitive closure computations on intervals for Allen constraints and uses constraint satisfaction for point-based metric reasoning.
