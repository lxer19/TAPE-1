Reference-contexts: There are many applications for multimedia flows in an object-oriented environment. Digital teleconferencing has already proven to be an effective way to hold meetings without traveling <ref> [Taz88, Sak90, AEH88] </ref>. Multimedia electronic mail systems, such as Diamond [FT82], ease communication between participants, especially those who are not used to using computers. At Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, researchers are building a collaborative notebook for physical scientists.

Reference-contexts: In Mermaid, synchronization, routing, and distribution are done separately for voice, video, and data. This allows all three to run at higher speeds, but makes the synchronization of the media more difficult. Researchers are also focusing on developing sharable audio servers for supporting multimedia applications. <ref> [AHL + 91] </ref> describes a client-server model that uses an audio server for supporting shared access to audio hardware, introduces a protocol that provides applications with a device-independent interface to the audio capabilities of the workstation (virtual devices), and provides primitives for synchronizing the various media components. [TP91] describes an extension <p> Annotator will support different editing operations such as substring, and indexing. Other researchers have noted that sound devices are difficult to share because of their serial nature <ref> [AHL + 91] </ref>. However, in the Suite environment many different applications may want to use the sound device. For instance, if a user is listening to audio annotations through the audio device, another user may try to initiate a teleconference session.

Reference-contexts: Implementing each filter as a separate Suite object would result in performance problems, so we use the idea of merged server design developed in RAID <ref> [BDR86] </ref> so that many filters can run within a single address space. 2.4.3 Sound as a Suite base object Dialog managers in Suite are generalized editors, with built-in support for editing base objects, such as integers, characters, strings, and sequences of base objects.

Reference-contexts: Use a packet filter on a separate workstation attached to the same ethernet to measure the load caused by the sound packets. Computing requirements Measure the computing costs of live audio on modern workstations. In practice, much of the cost of communication is computation <ref> [BMRS89] </ref>. Since audio is most often used in support of other applications, it is important that it not put too much load on the system. Wide-area network Introduce artificial delay and see if the participants are able to follow the conversation.

Reference-contexts: We are working with Prasun Dewan and his research group at Purdue University to develop concurrency control techniques that support the entire range of collaborative activity, using adaptability techniques to change concurrency control techniques dynamically <ref> [BR89] </ref>. Part of that support is multimedia flows integrated with the objects in the system. We are actively exploring concurrency control techniques that are effective at presenting users with a consistent view of all the objects in the system, including multimedia flows. 24

Reference-contexts: Distributed education is also possible, with students at remote sites seeing video images of the instructor, and participating in the class through sound transmitted back to the classroom. For instance, collaborative visualization tools will allow the students to interactively explore algorithms with their instructors <ref> [Bro88, TR91, HR91] </ref>. Digital audio will enable instructors to respond to questions verbally, rather than having to type replies. SuiteSound supports development of applications like these by integrating flexible, easy-to-use digital audio with a flexible, easy-to-use object-based system.

Reference-contexts: These method invocations from a sound object to an application filter are named callbacks because the method to be invoked is passed to another object, which "calls-back" the original object. Callbacks are similar to 10 Swift's upcalls <ref> [Cla85] </ref> in that they are invocations from a lower layer of a protocol stack to a higher layer. Within an application, callbacks are used to pass the data from one filter to the next in the flow, until it arrives at the sink.

Reference-contexts: To avoid this problem, our applications do not construct cyclic flows. For instance, the Teleconf play and record objects are separate to avoid creating a false cycle. None of these problems would exist in an operating system that supports multiple threads of control in each address space <ref> [CZ85, Ras86] </ref>. The fourth problem is that callback methods must be statically bound. For instance, when an object asks a SuiteSound record object to issue periodic callbacks, the name of the callback method is fixed at compile time. We work around this problem by using fixed names for callback procedures.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) is the study of methods for enhancing cooperation among computer users by providing tools that explicitly support the user interaction and sharing of information [EGR91, Taz88]. Suite is an object-based system with powerful tools for developing distributed collaborative applications. <ref> [DV90, DC91] </ref>. This paper describes SuiteSound, a tool for manipulating multimedia flows, such as for digital audio, in Suite. Adding digital audio to Suite enhances distributed collaboration by helping participants work together more naturally. <p> The Suite object model is an extension of UNIX allowing distributed, shared, protected, and persistent objects. Suite objects coexist with existing components of the operating system, access conventional resources, and can be invoked by conventional processes <ref> [DC91] </ref>. 2.4.2 Filters: High-level constructs for manipulating flows The new design for SuiteSound includes a higher-level specification system for connecting filters. Currently the filters are specified procedurally, and the SuiteSound program includes code for moving the messages from the source to the sink.

Reference-contexts: We also describe the experiments needed to measure the effectiveness and the load that these extensions will put on networks and workstations. 2.4.1 Suite: Distributed, persistent objects Suite is a software system designed and developed at Purdue University by Prasun Dewan and his research team <ref> [Dew90] </ref>. Suite supports remote procedure calls (RPC), active persistent data, and management of "direct manipulation" user interfaces. A prototype of Suite has been implemented on top of UNIX, TCP/IP, NFS, and X [DV90]. The Suite object model is an extension of UNIX allowing distributed, shared, protected, and persistent objects.

Reference-contexts: Adding digital audio to Suite enhances distributed collaboration by helping participants work together more naturally. Since SuiteSound is integrated with Suite, applications can use sound in the way that is most natural for them. For instance, Collaborative Software Inspection (CSI) <ref> [DMRT91] </ref> is a tool that supports distributed software inspection, using Suite for the software modules being inspected, and SuiteSound for audio ( section 4.3.). <p> We have designed and built a distributed collaborative software inspection, relaxing the requirement that all the participants be in the same room, providing automated support, and adding structure to the process. CSI allows geographically distributed participants to collaborate in the inspection and provides automated support for all inspection activities <ref> [DMRT91] </ref>. Participants communicate through CSI dialog managers, Teleconf, and voice annotation. The asynchronous activities of software inspection include the distribution of target material and the creation of reviewer's fault lists.

Reference-contexts: Floor control policies usually permit or deny access to all the objects in the collaboration simultaneously, conceptually controlling the entire "floor" at once. More general concurrency control policies separate the objects into domains that can be accessed individually <ref> [EG89] </ref>. There are three reasons to use floor control for on-line sound: listener overload, bandwidth, and more effective conferencing. Listener overload refers to the difficulty in understanding multiple sound sources simultaneously.

Still other systems have applied digital audio to collaboration and decision-making. For instance, the MERMAID system is designed for collaborative decision-making with multiple remote participants <ref> [Sak90] </ref>. Data, voice, and video are transmitted using N-ISDN channels with 64Kpbs per channel. The voice and data use one B-channel and video the other. Users can talk freely, with voices mixed and transmitted to all users simultaneously. <p> However, Free mode puts considerable load on the machines and as the number of participants grows to more than three, the machines will be unable to keep up. We concur with other researchers that teleconferencing with no floor control is difficult with more than three participants <ref> [Sak90] </ref>. We are performing experiments to measure the load per user in free mode. We are also investigating extensions to free mode in which sound data representing relatively silent periods is not transmitted, reducing the load considerably.

Reference-contexts: Having open channels between all pairs of participants is very expensive in computing and networking resources. Floor control can reduce the requirements from n 2 open channels to n open channels. Finally, floor control can actively support more effective interaction. Systems such as Colab <ref> [SFB + 87] </ref> have demonstrated the benefits of explicit support for decision making systems. Floor control tactics can ensure that everyone gets a turn to speak, or can allow a meeting chair to directly control the meeting.

However, objects are inherently discrete, conceptually containing the representation of the state of a system at a fixed point in space and time. Continuous media, such as voice and video, flow across time, with no convenient boundaries for object representation.
