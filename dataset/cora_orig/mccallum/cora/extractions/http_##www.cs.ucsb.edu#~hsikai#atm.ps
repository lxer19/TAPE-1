Reference-contexts: For large switches, it becomes technically and economically infeasible. On the other hand, input queueing has no such a difficulty, though it suffers low throughput. It has been demonstrated <ref> [HK88, KH87] </ref> that the maximum throughput of large switches is only 0.5858 under uniform traffic assumption. If the packet destinations are not uniformly distributed, say more packets going to some hot spots, the throughput is expected to be even lower. <p> The differences between our approximated throughputs and the simulation data are small, less than 3%. The throughputs of window mechanism for uniform traffic have been accurately approximated. The maximum throughputs of various window sizes under uniform traffic assumption have also been simulated by Hluchyj and Karol <ref> [HK88] </ref>. Our simulation results agree with theirs. Both numerical results and simulation data show that window mechanism does improve the throughput of input queueing. Maximum throughput is increased from 0.59 to 0.70, an 18% increase, by having window size of two.
