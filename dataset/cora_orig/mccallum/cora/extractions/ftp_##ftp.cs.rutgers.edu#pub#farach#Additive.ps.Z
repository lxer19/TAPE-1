Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting an n fi n distance matrix D by a tree metric T . Let " be the distance to the closest tree metric, that is, " = min T fk T; D k 1 g. First we present an O(n 2 ) algorithm for finding an additive tree T such that k T; D k 1 3", giving the first algorithm for this problem with a performance guarantee. Second we show that it is N P-hard to find a tree T such that k T; D k 1 &lt; 9

Fitting distances by trees is an important problem in many areas. For example, in statistics, the problem of clustering data into hierarchies is exactly the tree fitting problem.

Reference-contexts: Definition 2.2 A metric D is additive if, for all points a; b; c; d, D [a; b] + D [c; d] maxfD [a; c] + D [b; d]; D [a; d] + D [b; c]g: This inequality in known as the 4-point condition. Theorem 2.3 (Buneman <ref> [3] </ref>) A metric is additive if and only if it is a tree metric. Definition 2.4 A metric D is an ultrametric if, for all points a; b; c, D [a; b] maxfD [a; c]; D [b; c]g: As noted above, an ultrametric is a type of tree metric.

Reference-contexts: In 1977 [9] it was shown that if there is a tree T coinciding exactly with D, it is unique and constructible in linear, i.e., O (jSj 2 ), time. Unfortunately there is typically no tree T coinciding exactly with D, and in 1987 <ref> [5] </ref>, it was shown that for L 1 and L 2 , the numerical taxonomy problem is N P-hard, both in the additive and in the ultrametric cases.

Reference-contexts: The only positive fitting result is from 1993 <ref> [6] </ref> and shows that under the L 1 norm an optimal ultrametric is polynomially computable, in fact in linear time. However, while ultrametrics have interesting special case applications, the fundamental problem in the area of numerical taxonomy is that of fitting by general tree metrics. <p> However, while ultrametrics have interesting special case applications, the fundamental problem in the area of numerical taxonomy is that of fitting by general tree metrics. Unfortunately no provably good algorithms existed for fitting distances by additive metrics, and in <ref> [6] </ref> this was posed as a major open problem. 1 Our Results We consider the Numerical Taxonomy Problem for additive metrics under the L 1 norm. <p> Note that these function, A (); A a (); and U () need not be single-valued. In the following, we will let the output be an arbitrary optimal metric, unless otherwise noted. Recall that U () is computable in O (n 2 ) time <ref> [6] </ref>. Lemma 3.1 suggests that we may be able to approximate the closest additive metric to D by approximating the closest ultrametric to D + C a ; i.e., by computing U (D + C a ) C a , for some point a. <p> any distance matrix M , define U a (M ) to be an a-restricted ultrametric minimizing k M; U a (M ) k 1 . k M; U a (M ) k 1 can be computed in O (n 2 ) time by a minor modification of the algorithm in <ref> [6] </ref>. Let T = U a (D + C a ) C a . We now show that T = A a (D). Claim 3.4A T is an a-restricted additive tree. Proof: Let D a = D + C a . Constraint 2 implies that T is a-restricted.

Reference-contexts: A table of pairwise distances is thus constructed. The problem is then to reconstruct the underlying evolutionary tree. Dozens of heuristics for this problem appear in the literature every year (see e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>). The numerical taxonomy problem is usually cast in the following terms. The Numerical Taxonomy Problem Input: D : S 2 ! &lt; 0 , a distance matrix. Output: A tree metric T which spans S and fits D. <p> History The numerical taxonomy problem for additive metrics fitting under L k norms was explicitly stated in current form in 1967 [4].
