Title: Tool-Based Haptic Interaction with Dynamic Physical Simulations using Lorentz Magnetic Levitation  
Author: Peter Berkelman 
Degree: Thesis Proposal  
Date: July 27, 1997  
Affiliation: Robotics  
Abstract: I propose for my thesis project to build a high-performance 6 degree of freedom magnetic levitation haptic interface device, integrate its operation for use with realistic, detailed, graphically displayed three-dimensional simulated physical environments, and evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting rigid-body haptic interaction system. In tool-based haptic interaction, the user feels and interacts with the simulated environment through a rigid tool of a given shape rather than directly with the hand and fingers. Consequently, a tool-based haptic interaction device only needs to control the dynamics of the rigid-body tool grasped by the user, rather than stimulate the user's skin, joints, or muscles directly. Tool-based human tasks such as cutting, pushing, screwing, probing, and inserting can all be simulated with tool-based haptic interaction. An ideal haptic interface would enable simulated virtual objects to be sensed and manipulated in exactly the same natural and intuitive manner as real objects in the world. The high dexterity and sensitivity of the human hand provides a rich and direct medium for interaction between the user and the simulated world. Psychophysical studies have shown that the haptic sensitivity of the human hand extends to the micron level with a bandwidth of at least several hundred Hertz [1, 2]. To realistically emulate the experience of handling real objects, the haptic interface system must reproduce object dynamics at the same high level of detail and responsiveness. To achieve this performance requires a device with stiff and lightweight moving parts, powerful and responsive actuators, high resolution sensors, and a fast, low latency control system. Lorentz levitation technology [3] is especially well suited to high-performance tool-based haptic interaction because it provides motion and force feedback in 6 DOF with very high control bandwidths and sensitivity, non-contact actuation and position sensing, and only one moving part. The magnetic levitation haptic interaction system under development provides a comfortable range of motion for the fingertips for fine haptic tasks and is totally enclosed in a desktop-height cabinet. A complete evaluation of the dynamic performance of the maglev device will be performed to demonstrate its potential for realistic haptic interaction. I plan to integrate a physically-based realtime dynamic simulation of rigid objects and added surface effects of texture and friction with the haptic interface. An intermediate representation scheme for the local simulated environment will be developed and implemented to maintain consistency between the device controller and the physical simulation and to determine the correct rigid-body behavior of the haptic device between the much slower updates of the physical simulation. The effectiveness of the haptic interface system will be demonstrated by simulating the execution of sample haptic tasks.

Reference-contexts: The sliding force threshold is determined by the defined coefficient of friction between the surfaces and the normal force between the objects f n according to Coulomb friction: f f = f n Both types of friction have been demonstrated by the author <ref> [26] </ref> with a static environment using the IBM magic wrist. Implementation is straightforward and leads to a high degree of perceived realism in the haptic interaction. <p> Surface texture was emulated with the Magic Wrist by defining a multifaceted surface and treating interaction with that surface in the same way as with other rigid surfaces <ref> [26] </ref>. A flat surface with parallel sawtooth grooves 200 m wide and deep was defined as in Fig 21 (b). Contact with the angled 31 walls of the grooves produces a reaction force normal to the surface proportional to the interpenetration distance.

Reference-contexts: The integration of these friction emulation techniques with realtime physically-based modeling simulations will be an important result of this research work. 10.3 Texture Convincing, realistic haptic display of texture was first demonstrated in the "sandpaper system" <ref> [37] </ref> with a 2-DOF force-reflecting joystick. Surface roughness was shown even with only 2 DOF in the plane by generating forces proportional to the local gradient of a simulated bumpy surface as shown in Fig. 21 (a). <p> Dynamic and static Coulomb surface friction as well as texture is emulated in [42] by Mark et al. by a surface populated by snags in a model similar to the bumpy surface texture model of <ref> [37] </ref>.

A buzzing sensation was felt as the flotor was moved perpendicular to the texture grooves, while the motion felt smooth parallel to the grooves. <p> Coulomb friction itself is an approximate model which averages out the effects of microscopic surface variations.
