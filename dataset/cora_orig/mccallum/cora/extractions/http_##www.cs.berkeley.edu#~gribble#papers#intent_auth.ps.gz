Reference-contexts: However, introduced with each of these potential improvements is a new set of problems. Annotators and authors reusing annotated footage are prone to fall prey to the syntactic ambiguity and semantic unpredictability problems, identified by Csinger et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Hypermedia authors, relieved of some of the burden of deciding final content, must instead provide many navigational links and must ensure that a viewer can easily navigate through those links to all poten-tially desirable content.

Reference-contexts: In the framework discussed in this paper, the black box is implemented as a Horn-Clause reasoning engine, written in the prolog programming language. A typical reasoning engine may use AI techniques to build presentations (Csinger, Booth and Poole <ref> [2] </ref>). Reasoning engines may actively gather other information, if it is available. <p> Defining a suitable metric of sensitivity is not an easy task, however (refer to Csinger et al. <ref> [2] </ref>). The pertinent elements of the user model selected by the reasoning engine are transferred to the hyper-brochure application in an abstract form.

Reference-contexts: Unlike intent-based presentation (see, for example, Seligmann and Feiner [6] or Karp and Feiner <ref> [3] </ref>), the intent-based authoring paradigm identifies a third attribute of a presentation in addition to form and content the author's intent.

Reference-contexts: This type of information (and more) might be found in a media-specific knowl edge base. 4. User models: Models of the users that will be viewing the presentations embody the final repository of knowledge needed by an intent-based authoring system. User models (Kobsa <ref> [4] </ref> or Wahlster and Kobsa [7]) may be acquired in a number of ways: they might be static models programmed by a knowledgeable agent, or they may dynamically change through direct, explicity feedback from the users themselves or through inferences drawn from the actions of the users.

Reference-contexts: If the temporal portions of presentations could be summarized in a nontemporal format, the viewer may be able to form an opinion of the presentation in a more timely manner. One possibility is to construct a graphical representation of the presentation and use a fisheye view (Noik <ref> [5] </ref>) of the representation in order to highlight the relevant features. If the user is in the process of browsing multiple presentations, the differences between presentations may be candidates for relevancy. 4 Conclusions Overcoming the well-known liabilities of the traditional authoring paradigm provided the motivation for an intent-based authoring paradigm.

Reference-contexts: However, such systems still require an author to select the content of the presentation, and in fact the author also provides a partial specification of the document's structure in the form of a hierarchical decomposition of its content. Unlike intent-based presentation (see, for example, Seligmann and Feiner <ref> [6] </ref> or Karp and Feiner [3]), the intent-based authoring paradigm identifies a third attribute of a presentation in addition to form and content the author's intent.
