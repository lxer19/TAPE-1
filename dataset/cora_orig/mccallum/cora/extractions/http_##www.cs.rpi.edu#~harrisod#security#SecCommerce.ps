Affiliation: Architectures of Distributed Computers Computer Science Department Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  
Abstract: Herein lies a description of the problems that beset the developers of on-line commercial systems in an historically insecure environment-- the Internet. From the founding assumptions and requirements, to descriptions of encryption, digital signatures, and hashes, to simple protocols that solve many of the problems facing the computer industry. This paper provides a starting point for those desiring more in depth understanding than provided by magazine articles, without requiring as much technical background as needed to comprehend a journal article.

Reference-contexts: What happens if an order to change an entry in one servers access control database never arrives. Synchronization mechanisms would have to be added in order to keep all of the access control databases coherent. Agrawal goes into more detail on the aspects of mirroring databases, security, and fault-tolerance <ref> [1] </ref>. When mirroring is employed, the user needs only to identify him or herself to a single mirror since all activity will be performed with that single mirror. However, the customer must still identify him or herself when he or she establishes a connection with the shops mirror.

Reference-contexts: The effort has gained wide recognition as evidenced by papers presented on security at the first two World Wide Web conferences last year [10][31], the dedication of an entire issue of Communications of the ACM <ref> [2] </ref> [15] [25], and articles in various magazines including Byte [27]. 5 Securing CommerceNet Why so much talk about security? People in the computer industry and education still remember the infamous Internet worm and many have heard of passwords captured when they were transmitted in plaintext across the Internet. <p> Why? Because they usually have the most to lose if there are aws in the security used for handling financial transactions. A large unaccountable withdrawal often ends in a lawsuit or settlement in which the bank loses to the customer <ref> [2] </ref>. Based on the actions of existing banks, we will assume that a banker wants the following: 1. Obtain as much money as possible to reinvest. 2. Levy charges on every transaction that involves the bank. 3. <p> G. Bank Computers can be Trusted to Protect Bank Accounts From Electronic Attacks Since banks have been providing security for ages, they should be proficient providers of security; however, stories presented by Anderson <ref> [2] </ref> may shake your trust in the intelligence of bank computer security. Unfortunately, any solution that imposes intrusive security software on banks will most likely fail to see much use since banks have already invested heavily in their own security systems which they now trust.

Reference-contexts: SecureMosaic, the browser provided by EIT for the CommerceNet [34], provides means for accomplishing transactions. As with previous versions of Mosaic, SecureMosaic uses a simple language for generating hypertext documents called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) <ref> [3] </ref>. This language allows construction of fill-out forms. Forms so that CommerceNet retailers/shop-owners can present forms that look similar to the paperwork that a consumer would fill-out if the consumer went to the shop in person (as opposed to across the network).

Reference-contexts: There are few standards and far less implementation of security software and hardware on the Internet. Even now, there are decisions left to make regarding the protocols that will be used (i.e., Secure-HTTP [26], PEM [18], and MIME <ref> [4] </ref>). For example, CommerceNet has yet to decide on a form of electronic money [23]. First Virtual has opted for reaching the marketplace early rather than securely. First Virtual [11] opened the first Internet bank earlier this year.

Accelerate the mainstream application of elec tronic commerce on the Internet through fielding member-driven programs. Pilots include: transaction security, payment services; electronic catalogs; Internet EDI; engineering data transfer and design-to-manufacturing. <ref> [6] </ref> Before devising a secure environment suitable for electronic commerce, we must identify the parties that will use our commercial system and then ascertain their needs.

Reference-contexts: The first can be partially solved via cryptographic protocols, but alas the other is reliant purely on physical security. Fortunately, providing physical security is the responsibility of various security companies and is outside the scope of our discussion. With respect to the largest on-line service, CompuServe <ref> [7] </ref> can be reached via telnet 1 from the internet over which passwords are transmitted in plain text [8]. Fortunately, few customers chose to use the archaic text-based telnet interface; therefore, few passwords are subjected to possible capture while travelling across the Internet.

Fortunately, few customers chose to use the archaic text-based telnet interface; therefore, few passwords are subjected to possible capture while travelling across the Internet. Unfortunately commercial on-line services neither provide retailers with direct control over their advertisements, nor reach the entire, quickly-growing Internet community. <p> When more than one person usess a computer, access control is also essential to prevent people from accessing other peoples private keys. If such access were not provided, two individuals on the same computer could assume each others identities. 1. CompuServe is working on an information manager <ref> [8] </ref> that will access CompuServe Information Services via a TCP socket and will use encryption for passwords and certain other unspecified information; therefore, people connected via Internet could log on using a graphical user interface, and would receive at least slightly better security than with plaintext telnet. 2.

Secure-HTTP talks about nonce based authentication, but Secure-HTTP is a transport protocol. Actual access control is not discussed much with respect to CommerceNet, but at some point it will have to be. We believe that combining authentication and access control is adequate for almost all access control. 7.

Only in cases where extreme security is required does a WWW server need to impose any additional access control such as a password.

Reference-contexts: One key looks very much like any other. Without some external information (e.g., a label containing a name), we do not know who issued the key. Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman invented the most popular public-key algorithm <ref> [28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The fourth goal will probably spawn many legal battles once CommerceNet has seen wide-spread use, but until that time we will have to wait to see what legal recourse will be provided for network customers and retailers <ref> [29] </ref>. For now we will assume that the retailers have more to lose than the customers and therefore retailers can be trusted to provide a service or product after payment has been received from the customer. <p> If these signatures are legally binding then, as shown in the last section, capture of the private key would allow a criminal to sign financially disastrous agreements on behalf of the company. There is every indication that digital signatures will be legally binding, in fact according to RSAs FAQ <ref> [29] </ref>, the federal government requires U.S. federal government purchase orders will be signed by any such [digital signature] standard; this implies that the government will support the legal authority of digital signatures in the courts. G. <p> The RSA algorithm has never been proven secure, but it has withstood many years of intense scrutiny, and is therefore trusted enough to be used in standards published by the International Standards Organization (ISO), the Consultative Committee in International Telegraphy and Telephony (CCITT), and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) <ref> [29] </ref>. For this reason RSA is one of the encryption schemes used in the secure transport protocol used by SecureMosaic and Secure WWW Servers. As mentioned earlier this transport is called Secure-HTTP (Secure-HyperText Transport Protocol). <p> C. Digital Signatures There are several kinds of digital signatures, but all of them rely on public key cryptography. The most popular signature algorithm relies on the RSA algorithm. Congress has mandated <ref> [29] </ref> a second digital signature algorithm called DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) for use by government agencies and government contractors. Secure-HTTP uses both of the signature algorithms so that CommerceNet software can be used by both the government and private sectors.

Reference-contexts: Encryption: process by which data is transformed such that the meaning can not be gained from the results of the encryption without applying a reverse transformation (i.e., decryption). Schneier <ref> [32] </ref> defines encryption as, the process for disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance...

Further the function meets the following requirements: 1. Given M, it is easy to compute h. 2. Given h, it is hard to compute M. 3. <p> Besides, requiring an external storage medium increases the inconvenience of the commercial system. Remember the third requirement of the consumer? As an alternative we could base encryption key E on a password. One simple method described by Schneier <ref> [32] </ref> involves requesting that the user provide an arbitrary-length text string called a pass-phrase. This pass-phrase is then fed to a one-way secure hash function (see VI.D. Secure Hashes) which transforms the pass-phrase into a pseudo-random bit string. This is called key crunching. <p> For a good overview of the available symmetric key encryption schemes see Schneier <ref> [32] </ref>. B. Data Transport Once access has been gained to the users key database. Each user must be able to perform the core technologies upon which we will build our protocols. In other words, users must be able to exchange keys, encrypt data, and decrypt data.
