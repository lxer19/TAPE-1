Abstract: We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using nonlinear conditional density estimators. We demonstrate that useful structures can be extracted from a data set in a self-organized way and we present sampling techniques for belief update based on

Reference-contexts: Both aspects are particularly important for medical or fault diagnosis systems. More recently, learning of structure and of parameters in Bayesian networks has been addressed allowing for the discovery of structure between variables <ref> (Buntine, 1994, Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. Most of the research on Bayesian networks has focused on systems with discrete variables, linear Gaussian models or combinations of both. Except for linear models, continuous variables pose a problem for Bayesian networks.

Reference-contexts: Bayesian networks are commonly used as a representation of the knowledge of domain experts. Experts both define the structure of the Bayesian network and the local conditional probabilities. Recently there has been great emphasis on learning structure and parameters in Bayesian networks <ref> (Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. Most of previous work concentrated on models with only discrete variables or on linear models of continuous variables where the probability distribution of all continuous given all discrete variables is a multidimensional Gaussian. <p> In the Section 5 we describe a heuristic search which is closely related to search strategies commonly used in discrete Bayesian networks <ref> (Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. 4 Prior Models In a Bayesian framework it is useful to provide means for exploiting prior knowledge, typically introducing a bias for simple structures. <p> Given more specific knowledge in form of a structure defined by a domain expert we can alternatively penalize the deviation in the arc structure <ref> (Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. Furthermore, prior knowledge can be introduced in form of a set of artificial training data. <p> The procedure stops if every arc change decreases the score. This greedy strategy can get stuck in local minima which could in principle be avoided if changes which result in worse performance are also accepted with a nonzero probability 7 <ref> (such as in annealing strategies, Heckerman, 1995) </ref>. Calculating the new score at each step requires only local computation. The removal or addition of an arc corresponds to a simple removal or addition of the corresponding dimension in the Gaussians of the local density model.

Reference-contexts: Most of the research on Bayesian networks has focused on systems with discrete variables, linear Gaussian models or combinations of both. Except for linear models, continuous variables pose a problem for Bayesian networks. In Pearl's words <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>: "representing each [continuous] quantity by an estimated magnitude and a range of uncertainty, we quickly produce a computational mess. [Continuous variables] actually impose a computational tyranny of their own." In this paper we present approaches to applying the concept of Bayesian networks towards arbitrary nonlinear relations between continuous variables.
