Abstract: In The Mismeasure of Man (1981) Stephen Jay Gould provides a typically readable history of one of our most vexatious intellectual enterprises: the scientific study of intelligence. Gould is successful, as always, in rendering the relevant scientific debates accessible to general readers. What Gould does less well is to carry through his attack on prior attempts to understand natural intelligence scientifically: attempting to muster all possible arguments against such science, he conjures up a variety of impossible arguments as well. One such argument urges that Gould's predecessors are not to be taken seriously because they are racists and have let their racism influence their scientific practice. Gould has no difficulty in demonstrating the influence of racism; where he goes astray is in his dismissal of such prior work as simply unscientific because the racist conclusions preceded the collection of data. Advancing hypotheses prior to experimentation is how all of science proceeds, and is no mark of inferior work. And no science is immune to influences|racist or otherwise|from the culture in which it is embedded, as Gould elsewhere readily acknowledges. Another failed argument claims that all of the factor analysts studying intelligence have committed the intellectual sin of reifying the factors uncovered in IQ tests|concluding that the factors are real solely on the basis of how a factor analysis summarizes IQ data. Gould concludes that factor analysis is worthless for the study of intelligence. However: (1) contrary to what Gould fl I wish to thank Noretta Koertge, Bruce Sobol and two anonymous referees for useful comments on earlier drafts of this paper

Reference-contexts: In fact, just such an abductive employment of factor analysis is strikingly well defended in part I of Clark Glymour et al. (1987); and exploratory factor analysis is related to interesting research on probabilistic causality using structural equation models <ref> (cf. Nancy Cartwright, 1989) </ref>. 8 In the end, Gould's claim that the factor analysts commit an error of reification is based on nothing more than the fact that their causal theories are underdetermined by their data.
