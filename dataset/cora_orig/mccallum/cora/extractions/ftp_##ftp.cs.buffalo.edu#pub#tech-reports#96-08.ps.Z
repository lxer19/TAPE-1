Abstract: Dynamic stress testing is an important process that is used to improve the reliability of circuits. In this paper, we investigate the problem of computing cyclic sequences which can be used during burn-in of full scan circuits. Using a switching activity model we show that the stress due to electro-migration and hot-electron degradation can be accurately modeled. Notwithstanding the difficulty of computing optimal dynamic stress tests, we demonstrate experimentally that efficient heuristics can be developed to compute good dynamic stress tests for full scan circuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Growing size and complexity of VLSI circuits, reduction in feature sizes, narrower interconnection lines and smaller contacts is making production of reliable chips a challenging task. Stress testing is an effective method to improve product reliability <ref> [1] </ref>. To understand this consider Figure 1 where failure probability is plotted against time. This curve is known as the bathtub curve [1, 2]. Failure probability is high in the early period of product life. This is known as infant mortality. <p> Stress testing is an effective method to improve product reliability [1]. To understand this consider Figure 1 where failure probability is plotted against time. This curve is known as the bathtub curve <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Failure probability is high in the early period of product life. This is known as infant mortality. It is explained by the presence of weak ICs in the production lots. <p> This reduces early field failure rate and improves product reliability. Products under stress fail in different ways. The most appropriate way to stress a product depends upon the failure modes targeted. Stress induced failures are primarily of two kind: (a) threshold stress failures; and (b) cumulative stress failures <ref> [1] </ref>. Threshold stress failures occur in a specific product sample when the stress level exceeds the threshold strength of the sample. For example, mechanical stress of a brittle material or the temperature at which electronic component begins to malfunction. <p> After repeated exposure to these stresses, the cumulative change causes the product to fail. Examples of cumulative stress failures are failures that occur due to electromigration in a device under high current density, hot-electron degradation, oxide breakdown, fatigue failures of solder joints due to extended thermal cycling etc. <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. ICs are stressed in a variety of ways such as burn-in, power cycling, temperature cycling, voltage variations, clock variations etc [1]. Burn-in, the standard method used in industry for stressing ICs, is to subject ICs to high temperature and high voltage for an extended period [2]. <p> ICs are stressed in a variety of ways such as burn-in, power cycling, temperature cycling, voltage variations, clock variations etc <ref> [1] </ref>. Burn-in, the standard method used in industry for stressing ICs, is to subject ICs to high temperature and high voltage for an extended period [2]. Typical values used are 50 to 250 hours at 70 to 125 o C and 6 to 11 Volts [3]. <p> Highlighted blocks show the places where burn-in and testing are performed. Burn-in is performed at two places, once on the bare die and then on the assembled module. In addition to MCMs, burn-in is used to eliminate infant mortality in other semiconductor ICs like ASICs etc. <ref> [5, 1, 2] </ref>. Burn-in induces cumulative stress failures. There are three kinds of burn-in: Static, Dynamic and Monitored. Each burn-in stresses a class of defects and manufacturing imperfections [3]. In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to dynamic burn-in. <p> Let c be the last vector of the partial cycle constructed so far. For each vector v 2 V compute the set of nodes which the vector pair (c; v) switches (step 4.8). These nodes are classified into 10 Bins (Bin <ref> [1] </ref>-[10]). Bin [1] stores the number of nodes having average switching activity between 0 and 0.1 that vector pair (c; v) switches.

Bin [1] stores the number of nodes having average switching activity between 0 and 0.1 that vector pair (c; v) switches. Bin <ref> [2] </ref> stores the number of nodes with activity between 0.1 and 0.2 that vector pair (c; v) switches. (step 4.8) Each Bin has a weight associated with it (BinWeight [i]). Weights to bins are assigned such that BinWeight [i] is less than BinWeight [i+1] (1 i 9).

Hence average switching of a node which involves charging 3 and discharging of output load capacitance is considered a good measure of stressing the circuit node as far as electromigration is concerned <ref> [7] </ref>. Consider a switch level description of a NAND gate in Figure 3 (a). A 0 ! 1 transition charges the parasitic capacitance at the gate output through the pull-up network and a 1 ! 0 transition discharges it through the pull-down network.

Reference-contexts: It is shown that these problems are computationally difficult. However, we demonstrate experimentally that good heuristics can be developed to compute stress tests for dynamic burn-in of full scan circuits. The only related work known to us is <ref> [9] </ref>. It presents a study of computing cyclic stress tests for Monitored Burn-in. However, monitored burn-in has several drawbacks. (i) Since, in dynamic burn-in, selection of vectors is not restricted to a test set, higher switching activity can be generated. (ii) It requires a tester throughout the burn-in process. <p> This could limit the speed and effectiveness of burn-in. In addition to presenting a taxonomy of burn-in problems, it is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that most cyclic stress test problems pertinent to monitored burn-in can be solved efficiently. Optimal algorithm and faster heuristics along with experimental results were presented. <p> Ratio of the total number of nodes switched during the application of a cyclic sequence to the length of the cyclic sequence gives the average number of node switched per clock of the cyclic sequence. In <ref> [9] </ref>, average number of nodes switched per clock of the cyclic sequence was used as the measure. This measure has the following drawback. <p> Average switching of C 1 per clock is 1.7 while that of C 2 is 1.6. According to the measure used in <ref> [9] </ref>, C 1 is better than C 2 . However, it can be seen that in C 1 50% of the nodes have very low activity (10%) and in C 2 100% of the nodes have moderate activity (40%). <p> For s-nodes, cycles generated for monitored burn-in can also be used for dynamic burn-in. We compare the solutions computed by the optimal algorithm for generation cyclic stress tests for monitored burn-in described in <ref> [9] </ref> with k-lookahead heuristics. Results obtained by the Monitored burn-in heuristic are shown in Table 6. It can be seen that in general lookahead heuristics for dynamic burn-in computes much better cycles than that computed for monitored burn-in.
