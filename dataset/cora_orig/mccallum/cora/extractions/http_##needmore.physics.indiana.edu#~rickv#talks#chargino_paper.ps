Title: Search for Chargino and Neutralino Production Using the OPAL Detector at s 130 136 GeV
Date: 25 January 1996  
Note: EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH CERN-PPE/96-xxx  Submitted to Physics Letters  
Abstract: A search for charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, has been performed using a data sample of 2.6 pb 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =130 GeV and 2.6 pb 1 at 136 GeV collected with the OPAL detector at LEP during November 1995. No candidate events were observed. The 95% C.L. lower limit on the lightest chargino mass in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is 65.4 GeV if the universal scalar mass m 0 is greater than 1 TeV, and 58.7 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with slepton and sneutrino mass limits obtained at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak. These limits were obtained under the conditions that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi is larger than 1.5. The results of a model independent search for charginos and neutralinos are also given.

Reference-contexts: This provided an opportunity to search for new particles at these higher energies, but below the e + e ! W + W threshold. It is particularly interesting to search for charginos and neutralinos predicted by supersym-metric (SUSY) theories <ref> [1] </ref>. Charginos ~ j are the two mass eigenstates formed by the mixing of the fermionic partners of the charged gauge bosons (winos) and those of the charged Higgs bosons.

Reference-contexts: Fermionic partners of the fl (photinos), the Z boson (zinos), and the neutral Higgs bosons mix into the four mass eigenstates called neutralinos ~ 0 i . 1 The lightest neutralino ~ 0 1 is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle and is therefore stable and invisible if R-parity <ref> [2] </ref> is conserved. We used the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [3] to guide the analysis but more general cases were also studied.

Reference-contexts: We used the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) <ref> [3] </ref> to guide the analysis but more general cases were also studied. If charginos are light enough, they can be pair-produced in e + e collisions through fl or Z exchange in the s-channel and through sneutrino (~-) exchange in the t-channel.

Reference-contexts: Previous searches at LEP 1, running at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak, set lower limits on the mass of the charginos at around M Z =2 using a combination of direct searches and Z width measurements <ref> [6] </ref>. Similar but more model-dependent limits were obtained by the CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Tevatron [7]. Neutralino pairs ( ~ 0 i ~ 0 j ) can be produced through an s-channel virtual Z boson or by t channel selectron (~e) exchange.

Reference-contexts: At LEP 1 limits have been obtained from measurements of the width of the Z boson and direct searches <ref> [8] </ref>. If the ~ 0 2 is the lightest visible SUSY particle, it would decay into ~ 0 1 ` + ` or ~ 0 a Higgs boson, a scalar lepton, or a scalar quark. This leads to a similar experimental topology to that for chargino events. <p> The region (m ~ 0 1 + m ~ 0 2 ) &lt; M Z , which is accessible at LEP 1, is not considered in this analysis. For ~ 0 1 ~ 0 produced through Z boson decay better limits were obtained at LEP 1 <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.3 Limits on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model The negative results of the above searches can be interpreted in the framework of the MSSM where the gaugino-higgsino sector of the theory is completely determined by three parameters: M 2 , the universal mass of all gauginos at the unification scale;

Reference-contexts: The data sample collected at 140 GeV was very small and therefore was not used. 1 The indices i and j are ordered by increasing mass. 4 2 The OPAL Detector and Event Simulation 2.1 The OPAL Detector The OPAL detector, which is described in detail in <ref> [9] </ref>, is a multipurpose apparatus having nearly complete solid angle coverage. The central detector consists of a system of tracking chambers providing charged particle tracking over 96% of the full solid angle 2 inside a 0.435 T solenoidal magnetic field.

Reference-contexts: Calorimeters close to the beam axis measure the luminosity using small angle Bhabha scattering events and complete the geometrical acceptance down to 26 mrad. These include the forward detectors (FD) which are lead-scintillator sandwich calorimeters and at smaller angles, silicon tungsten calorimeters (SW) <ref> [10] </ref> located on both sides of the interaction point. The gap between the endcap EM calorimeter and FD is filled by an additional electromagnetic calorimeter, called the gamma-catcher. 2.2 Monte Carlo Event Simulation The Monte Carlo generator SUSYGEN [11] was used to produce chargino and neutralino pair events.

Reference-contexts: The selection was designed to maintain reasonable efficiency for these cases. Good charged tracks were selected using the same track quality requirements as in Ref. <ref> [18] </ref>. Tracks were required to have at least 20 measured space points, more than 50% of the hits ge ometrically expected, and transverse momentum exceeding 100 MeV. <p> The measurements of visible energy, mass and total transverse momentum of the events were performed by the method used in Ref. <ref> [18] </ref>. Four momentum vectors were formed for each track and calorimeter cluster, and then summed. The calorimeter clusters were treated as massless particles. <p> If the number of charged particles in the event was equal to two, this method was also used to calculate all the variables including visible energy and invariant masses. These events are mainly lepton pairs while the algorithm of Ref. <ref> [18] </ref> was optimised for hadronic jets. To select chargino and neutralino candidates, the number of good charged tracks was required to be at least two, and the ratio of the number of good tracks to the total number of tracks to be greater than 0.2.

A light m 0 sets the masses of the ~- and ~ ` to low values, thereby enhancing t-channel exchange diagrams that may have destructive interference with s-channel diagrams reducing the cross section for chargino production.
