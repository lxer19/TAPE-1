Title: Scalable Unix Tools on Parallel Processors  
Author: William Gropp and Ewing Lusk

Abstract: The introduction of parallel processors that run a separate copy of Unix on each process has introduced new problems in managing the user's environment. This paper discusses some generalizations of common Unix commands for managing files (e.g., ls) and processes (e.g., ps) that are convenient and scalable. These basic tools, just like their Unix counterparts, are text based. We also discuss a way to use these with a graphical user interface (GUI). Some notes on the implementation are provided. Prototypes of these commands are publically available.
