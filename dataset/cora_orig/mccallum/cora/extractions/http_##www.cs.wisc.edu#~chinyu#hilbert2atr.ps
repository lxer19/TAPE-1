Abstract: Two-sample weighted log-rank statistics are used in the presence of right censoring to test whether failure times from two populations have different survival distributions. Kosorok (1997) showed that large families of these statistics form stochastic processes indexed by functions and that these function-indexed statistics can be used to construct versatile test procedures simultaneously sensitive to a wide array of both ordered hazards and stochastic ordering alternatives. The complexity of the asymptotic distribution of these statistics precludes obtaining p-values through analytical means. In this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo method for accurately obtaining these p-values, and we evaluate the small and medium sample size properties of this method as well as compare the power of function-indexed statistics with previously developed weighted log-rank tests. These statistics are also examined in a data analysis of the fi-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). The results of this paper demonstrate that the proposed function-indexed procedures can be substantially more powerful for a variety of clinically relevant alternatives than previously described weighted log-rank tests.

Reference-contexts: The MERT approach can also be applied to certain infinite collections of alternative hypotheses and has been shown to be the minimax hypothesis test within a certain decision-theoretic framework <ref> (Bose and Slud, 1995) </ref>. When stochastic ordering alternatives are also of interest, Renyi-type supremums, taken over time, of weighted log-rank statistics have been shown to be quite effective (Gill, 1980; Fleming and Harrington, 1981; and Fleming, Harrington and O'Sullivan, 1987). <p> This is in contrast to the related loss of power occurring for the MERT statistic in the same situation <ref> (Bose and Slud, 1995) </ref>: the MERT statistic will not suffer from the multiple comparisons problem but will suffer from a decrease in the maximin non-centrality parameter.

Reference-contexts: It will generally not be difficult to find a suitable H and b n pair which contains this collection. In addition, since the MERT statistic in this setting is usually a convex combination of elements in the given collection <ref> (see Gastwirth, 1985, and Bose and Slud, 1995) </ref>, Lemma 1 of Kosorok (1997) tells us that the convex hull of H, co (H), is also a closed subset of G + r (K), and thus our collection can be expanded to include the MERT statistics for all sub-collections.

Reference-contexts: When this kind of difference is of interest, stochastic ordering alternatives will be appealing. Although tests based on differences between the Kaplan-Meier estimators have been developed for this purpose <ref> (see Pepe and Fleming, 1989) </ref>, Renyi-type supremums of weighted log-rank statistics over time have also been shown to be quite sensitive to 11 stochastic ordering alternatives (see Fleming, Harrington, and O'Sullivan, 1987).
