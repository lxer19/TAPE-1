Abstract: We propose a statistical technique of zone finding for the class of documents that are neither rigidly structured like tax forms nor very unstructured like magazine pages or engineering drawings. Given an initial window assumed to contain the final zone (bounding box) of interest, and a `signature' of the target, we propose to locate the final zone by a combination of simple outside in and inside out searches based on the assumption that the coordinates of the target have unimodal distribution. Results are presented in the bank check domain, and the applicability of the technique to other domains is discussed.

Reference-contexts: There are, to be sure, cases where zoning is nearly trivial, most importantly in forms processing systems dealing with a small variety of predefined structures, as is the case with tax and credit application OCR (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Such forms, with their fixed layout, are at the high end of a continuum of decreasingly rigid layout structures.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 presents some experimental results and discusses their significance. The concluding Section 3 is devoted to the larger question of how to extend the domain of the algorithm from bank checks to other problems of great practical importance such as finding the address block on mail pieces ([7], <ref> [2] </ref>). 1. Bank check zone finding In this section we present a bird's-eye view of our zone finding algorithms, concentrating on their abstract logical structure at the expense of implementation details.

Reference-contexts: When page layout is very flexible, probabilistic techniques can not gain sufficient purchase in the near-uniform priors, and region extraction is replaced by various top-down and bottom-up page decomposition techniques (for a recent survey see Chapter 4.3 of <ref> [3] </ref>). The statistical technique described in this paper comes into play when the distribution of zones to be OCR-ed is neither uniform nor fully predictable.

Reference-contexts: Visual inspection of graphs such as those given in Figs. 3-4, combined with hand-verification of the rejected check images, is sufficient to determine the confidence intervals for the location of the pivots. For other parameters it was necessary to perform the kind of gradient descent search described in <ref> [4] </ref> whereby the same algorithm is run with different settings until a performance optimum is found. For example, in the runs profile peaks are formed by merging those runs that are within a close proximity of each other.

Reference-contexts: For example, we take MINRUNWIDTH to be 128 and MINRUNDENSITY to be .75 (every three out of four pixels must be black), but why this and not some other values? To gain detailed data sets for statistical inferencing we used the bootstrapping methodology described in <ref> [6] </ref> whereby we iteratively gained more and more reliable knowledge of many empirically defined parameters related to the size, location, and density of the horizontal runs and projection profiles formed by these two lines.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes, it can be met only at a price of rejecting a small fraction of items, as is the case with postal address blocks if we define the window to be the bottom two-thirds of the piece (see <ref> [8] </ref>). Second, the distribution of the target within the initial window must be unimodal. This assumption is met by any target of which we approximately know where it will fall.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, runs broken up by salt-noise must be mended, which requires setting a MAXRUNGAP or MINRUNDENSITY parameter analogous to the smearing parameter C used in constrained run length algorithms (CRLA, see <ref> [9] </ref> and the references cited therein). Altogether there are some two dozen #define-s in the algorithm and setting them appropriately for the task is a major issue.
