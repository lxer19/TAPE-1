Abstract: Binocular stereo is the process of obtaining depth information from a pair of left and right views of a scene. We present a new approach to compute the disparity map by solving a global optimization problem that models occlusions, discontinuities, and epipolar-line interactions. In the model, geometric constraints require every disparity discontinuity along the epipolar line in one eye to always correspond to an occluded region in the other eye, while at the same time encouraging smoothness across epipolar lines. Smoothing coefficients are adjusted according to the edge and junction information. For some well-defined set of optimization functions, we can map the optimization problem to a maximum-flow problem on a directed graph in a novel way, which enables us to obtain a global solution in a polynomial time. Experiments confirm the validity of this approach.

Reference-contexts: To remedy this problem, we use intensity edges and junctions as cues for the depth discontinuities. The significance of junctions to stereo has been pointed out in <ref> [1, 16] </ref>. Our new approach uses edges and junctions in a uniform manner where ordinary pixels, edge pixels, and junction pixels increasingly suggest discontinuities in this order. <p> There is now abundant psychophysical evidence <ref> [1, 12, 19] </ref> that the human visual system does take advantage of the detection of occluded regions to obtain depth information. <p> Malik [16] brought attention to the role of junctions in stereo, together with Anderson's experiments <ref> [1] </ref>. Our use of junctions in this paper is limited to the detection of discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: This is why the algorithm in [22] cannot guarantee the monotonicity/ordering constraint. 4 Implementation and Results We implemented the architecture explained in the last section, with window features of small size for the real-image experiments. For the maximum-flow algorithm, we used the standard push-relabel method with global relabeling <ref> [8] </ref>. It took about 1 hour on 266Mhz Pentium II machine to compute the results on real images (512 fi 512 pixels). To see how the algorithm handles occlusions and discontinuities, we experimented with both random-dot stereogram and illusory surface images.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that by solving a maximum-flow problem one can obtain a minimum cut, a cut that minimizes the total cost u2S;v2T c (u; v) over all cuts. (See <ref> [9] </ref> for details.) Note that, in this formulation, we use a directed graph while in the method of [22] it suffices to use an undirected graph. The use of the directed graph is crucial to enforce the uniqueness constraint (2) and the ordering/monotonicity constraint (3).

Reference-contexts: Here we assume that (i) is solved, and hence the correspondence between epipolar lines (see Fig.1) in the two images are known. Answering question (v) involves determining the camera parameters, triangulation between the cameras, and an error analysis, for which we refer the reader to <ref> [10] </ref>. We focus on problems (ii), (iii), and (iv) in this paper. Main contributions of this paper to these problems are summarized as follows: (ii) A stereo algorithm solely based on matching pixels from the left and right views tends to have difficulties precisely locating the discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for instance, the cost for discontinuities must be at least linear on the size of the discontinuities. Roy and Cox <ref> [22] </ref> introduced maximum-flow algorithms on undirected graphs for stereo, a more limited set than directed graphs, to compute disparity maps. They also claimed the approach to be a generalization of the dynamic programming algorithm. <p> We do address all these experimental issues in this paper. 1.2 Background and Comparison to Previous Work A number of researchers, including Julesz [14]; Marr and Poggio [17]; Pollard, Mayhew and Frisby [21]; Grimson [13]; Kanade and Okutomi [15]; Ayache [2]; Roy and Cox <ref> [22] </ref>, have addressed the problem of binocular stereo matching without explicitly modeling occlusions and its relation to dis-continuities. There is now abundant psychophysical evidence [1, 12, 19] that the human visual system does take advantage of the detection of occluded regions to obtain depth information. <p> Malik [16] brought attention to the role of junctions in stereo, together with Anderson's experiments [1]. Our use of junctions in this paper is limited to the detection of discontinuities. As for optimization, Roy and Cox <ref> [22] </ref> presented the study of epipolar-line interaction through the use of maximum-flow algorithm, where they claimed that the algorithm provides a generalization of the dynamic programming algorithm to the two-dimensional stereo. <p> It is well known that by solving a maximum-flow problem one can obtain a minimum cut, a cut that minimizes the total cost u2S;v2T c (u; v) over all cuts. (See [9] for details.) Note that, in this formulation, we use a directed graph while in the method of <ref> [22] </ref> it suffices to use an undirected graph. The use of the directed graph is crucial to enforce the uniqueness constraint (2) and the ordering/monotonicity constraint (3). <p> In Fig.5 (b), constraint edges are depicted as dashed arrows, and none is cut. This cannot be done with undirected graphs, where having an edge with an infinite capacity is equivalent to merging two vertices, and thus meaningless. This is why the algorithm in <ref> [22] </ref> cannot guarantee the monotonicity/ordering constraint. 4 Implementation and Results We implemented the architecture explained in the last section, with window features of small size for the real-image experiments. For the maximum-flow algorithm, we used the standard push-relabel method with global relabeling [8]. <p> The experiments on random-dot stereograms were important as they made it apparent that occluded regions do not match any region, and therefore having multiple matches at these points as the algorithm in <ref> [22] </ref> does cannot possibly be right. Results are shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7. In both cases, the program successfully found the occluded regions in both left and right images. The correspondence diagram in Fig.7 shows the symmetric nature of our result. We also tested the algorithm on real images.
