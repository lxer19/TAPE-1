Abstract: We define the notion of weak relative pseudo-complement on meet semi-lattices, and we show that it is strictly weaker than relative pseudo-complementation, but stronger than pseudo-complementation. Our main result is that if a complete lattice L is meet-continuous, then every closure operator on L admits weak relative pseudo-complements with respect to continuous closure operators on L.

Reference-contexts: Our main result is that the weak relative pseudo-complement of a closure operator ae w.r.t. j, for j continuous, always exists when L is a meet-continuous complete lattice (i.e., when in L the meet preserves the join of chains). In <ref> [2] </ref>, this result is applied to static program analysis. 1 Note that the pseudo-complement is a particular case of weak relative pseudo-complement, hence the meet-continuity of L also guarantees that uco (L) is pseudo-complemented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Closure operators have been widely used in various fields of theoretical computer science, like semantics of declarative languages and program analysis. In particular, Cousot and Cousot proved in <ref> [3] </ref> that the lattice of abstract interpretations, or equivalently the lattice of the semantics derivable by abstraction, for an arbitrary program whose data-objects have a lattice structure L, is isomorphic to the lattice uco (L) of the upper closure operators on L.

Reference-contexts: Example 3.3 Consider the lattice L defined as in the previous example, but with the element h0; !i removed. In this case, L is not meet-continuous. The same lattice is used in <ref> [8, page 16] </ref> as an example of a distributive complete lattice which is not pseudo-complemented.
