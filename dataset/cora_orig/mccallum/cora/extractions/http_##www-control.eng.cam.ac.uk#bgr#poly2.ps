Reference-contexts: The logic of the algorithm is to start with a "standard" polytope, which is guaranteed to be a proper ext-representation, and then distort its geometry in a fashion which guarantees that the representation remains proper. Theorem 2.9: Let a = ff <ref> [1; : : :; 1] </ref> 0 , with ff &gt; 0. Then, U a is a proper ext-representation. The function maxstep will now be defined; it is the furthest "step" outwards a facet can be moved whilst remaining a proper ext-representation. <p> Theorem 4.2: Let 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1 kKk . There exists an N such that if a = ff <ref> [1; : : : ; 1] </ref> 0 , U a is a proper ext-representation which is strictly invariant under the flow f (x) defined by (4) and the system defined by (4) - (5) is uniformly asymptotically stable over U a . <p> Alternatively, one could directly prove uniform asymptotic stability by noting that the trajectory must enter the polytope generated by a = (1 *)ff <ref> [1; : : :; 1] </ref> 0 in a finite time; hence multiple applications of this property via scaling indicates that the trajectory will enter an arbitrarily small non-zero set surrounding the origin in finite time. ffi

Reference-contexts: Ordinarily, computations involving polytopes are quite involved, such as the problem of determining the vertices of an arbitrary polytope, or finding the convex hull of an arbitrary set of points. These are long studied problems, for example, see <ref> [4, Chapter 18] </ref> (amongst others). In this case, by restricting our attention to a special class of "standard" polytopes, it is possible to develop efficient computational schemes.

Typically, solutions are computed by finite difference 9 methods: a grid is imposed on the state space, and a solution is iteratively computed based on values at the grid points (for example, see the discussion in [5, Chapter IX]). <p> Typically, solutions are computed by finite difference 9 methods: a grid is imposed on the state space, and a solution is iteratively computed based on values at the grid points (for example, see the discussion in <ref> [5, Chapter IX] </ref>). The algorithm developed herein can be interpreted as being an attempt to solve the PDI (7) in a novel fashion.

Reference-contexts: It is likely that the solution is non- smooth; (7) should be interpreted in a weak sense (see the paper by M.R. James <ref> [7] </ref> for details on the use of weak sense (non-smooth) interpretations). Viscosity solution theory can be used to examine such non-smooth partial differential inequalities; see the text [5] by Fleming and Soner for an exposition on viscosity solutions).

Reference-contexts: Typically, we are interested in the case where the linearisation is stable, but the open loop system is unstable, which ensures that the system is not globally stable (a long known result; see <ref> [8] </ref> for a recent treatment of the combined continuous and discrete time results). Assumption 4.1: It is assumed that A BK is Hurwitz.

Reference-contexts: Then, as is compact, there exists a maximal value of dV dx fi x , and standard Lyapunov results indicate that V (x) goes to zero in a finite time (i.e., enters U a ). (See <ref> [9, Section 4.6] </ref> for an exposition on Lyapunov function theory (amongst others).) ffi Proof of Theorem 3.8: Examination of Lemma 3.5 shows that if the dot product of the flow with the tangent vectors remains negative definite evaluated at the connected vertices as the value of a i varies, along with <p> The asymptotic stability condition follows from noting that the trajectory cannot exit the initial polytope (hence the linear operating region) due to its invariance, and then application of standard Lyapunov theory for linear systems (for example, see <ref> [9, Lemma 4.6.4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In general, this is difficult, as it almost amounts to one having the solution to the problem in advance. There are general existence results (as in the paper by J.C. Willems <ref> [12] </ref>), but these are not practical in terms of a computational algorithm.
