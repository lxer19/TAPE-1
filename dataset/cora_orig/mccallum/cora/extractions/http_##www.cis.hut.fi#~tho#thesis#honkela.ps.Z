Reference-contexts: Research work and experimentation of the use of morphological analysis and generation tools along with the full-text database system called Minttu provided experience on the themes of information retrieval <ref> (cf. Alkula and Honkela, 1992) </ref>. The Minttu system was developed by the Finnish State Computer Center (VTKK, currently the Tieto Group) and it is widely used for storage and retrieval of administrative documents including the Finnish law. <p> Therefore, for instance, finding occurrences of a word in texts is problematic. The main result was a system architecture for keyword-based information retrieval (IR) systems that use morphological analyzers and generators of Finnish word forms <ref> (Alkula and Honkela, 1992) </ref>. The study also provided us insight into the general, well-known problems of IR. Searching for relevant documents from a very large collection has traditionally been based on keywords and their Boolean expressions. Often, however, the search results show high recall and low precision, or vice versa.

Reference-contexts: There exists a lot of neurophysiological evidence to support the idea that the SOM captures some of the fundamental processing principles of the brain. Some earlier artificial-neural-network models of self-organization have also been presented, e.g., by Shun-ichi Amari <ref> (Amari, 1967) </ref>, Christoph von der Malsburg (von der 18 rightmost column of Table 1 as used in labeling the map.

Reference-contexts: Schutze uses two clustering methods to determine the sense clusters. Bookman's model for natural language interpretation, LeMICON <ref> (Bookman, 1994) </ref>, combines symbolic and connectionist representations. LeMICON is a structured connectionist model that makes use of both connectionist and symbolic techniques to construct interpretations of text. The basic building blocks of LeMICON include a semantic memory and a working memory.

Reference-contexts: does not, however, take into account that the meaning of an expression (queries, responses) in a natural domain is graded and changing, biased by the particular context, as discussed above. 3.5 Emergent categories and adaptive prototypes The evidence for localization of linguistic functions in the brain is discussed, e.g., in <ref> (Caramazza et al., 1994) </ref>. They cite studies in which category-specific deficits of selective impairment including proper names and geographical names have been reported (McKenna and Warrington, 1978).

A number of studies is mentioned in (Caramazza et al., 1994) that show that 12 A connection to the relation between thought and language may be considered: if the weight of the linguistic input is high enough, the overall organization is partly determined by it rather than being only based on the "perceptual" component. 13 Not the present

Reference-contexts: This view is compatible with the approach adopted in this work. 3.4 Vocabulary problem and subjectivity In information retrieval and collaborative systems the vocabulary problem is commonplace: people tend to use different terms to describe a similar concept. See <ref> (Chen, 1994) </ref> for a thorough analysis of the problem and for a proposal for solving it. In the following, the vocabulary problem is discussed shortly, and, next, the underlying issue of subjectivity in interpretation and generation of language is considered in more detail.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical analysis of the algorithm has turned out to be very difficult. The proof of the convergence of the SOM learning process in the one-dimensional case was first given in <ref> (Cottrell and Fort, 1987) </ref>. Convergence properties are more generally studied, e.g., in (Erwin et al., 1991; Erwin et al., 1992a; Erwin et al., 1992b; Horowitz and Alvarez, 1996; Flanagan, 1997).

Reference-contexts: A thorough overview of connectionist models in information retrieval is given in <ref> (Doszkocs et al., 1990) </ref>. The connectionist models, often combined with the principles of the vector space model, appear to be a promising alternative for the traditional keyword-based methods. In the following, a novel SOM-based method for information retrieval and textual data mining, called WEBSOM, is introduced.

Reference-contexts: Semantic networks and frame systems share the underlying ontological assumption. See, e.g., (Winston, 1984) for an overview of the "classical" AI techniques. Their influence on the models and metaphors used in cognitive science is also substantial, see, e.g., <ref> (Eysenck and Keane, 1990) </ref> for a textbook account. Natural language is nowadays usually not viewed as a means for labeling the world but being an instrument by which the society and the individuals within it construct a model of the world. The world is continuous, and changing.

Reference-contexts: Also Gardenfors' recent work (e.g., Gardenfors, 1996a; 1996b) is very closely related to the issue of adaptive prototypes. 39 4 APPLICATION OF SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS TO DATA MINING OF TEXTS Data mining is a task that aims at identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and understandable patterns in data <ref> (Fayyad et al., 1995) </ref>. The general applicability of the SOM in data analysis and data mining becomes obvious from the proportion of the collection of 3014 references where the SOM has been used in tasks related to data mining 14 .

Reference-contexts: Many models rely on the framework of well-known symbolic grammars (e.g., Faisal and Kwasny, 1990; Nakamura et al., 1990; Schnelle and Wilkens, 1990). Connectionist approaches have been criticized, for instance, by claiming that a proper linguistic method should be able to represent constituent structures and to model compositionality <ref> (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988) </ref>. Multiple answers can be given to this line of criticism. At the level of semantics and pragmatics, the contextuality may be considered to be more important: the final interpretation of an expression is determined in the context in which it appears.

Reference-contexts: The degree of membership becomes, thus, a surface in a multi-dimensional space rather than a curve of one variable. The status or necessity of fuzzy logic has been questioned, e.g., by many traditional logicians <ref> (see, e.g., Haack, 1996) </ref>. Regardless of the philosophical arguments fuzzy logic has been found to be useful in constructing, for instance, practical control systems for cars, cameras, industrial processes, washing machines, etc. (Kosko, 1997).

Reference-contexts: Here, for instance, the area of the colors containing "blue" in their name forms a separate area of its own. 38 the category of living things can be selectively damaged while the non-living things have been spared, e.g., <ref> (Hillis and Caramazza, 1991) </ref>. These findings match well with the structure of the map shown in Publication 3 in which the inanimate and animate nouns can be found in the areas of their own in the lower right corner of the map.

Reference-contexts: The subjectivity in interpretation became more apparent when the rules for semantic analysis were collected, and when the experiences of the test users were considered <ref> (Honkela, 1989) </ref>. Research work and experimentation of the use of morphological analysis and generation tools along with the full-text database system called Minttu provided experience on the themes of information retrieval (cf. Alkula and Honkela, 1992).

Reference-contexts: The world is changing all the time, and, perhaps still more importantly, the symbolic descriptions are not grounded 11 . The contextuality of interpretation is easily neglected, being, nevertheless, a very commonplace phenomenon in natural language <ref> (see, e.g., Hormann, 1986) </ref>. A model of contextuality in interpreting imprecise size expressions is presented in Publication 1. The importance of context becomes evident when, e.g., ambiguity is considered: the interpretation of ambiguous expressions is based on their context. Pulkki (1995) presents means for modeling ambiguity using the SOM.

Reference-contexts: Scholtes has developed, based on the SOM, a neural filter and a neural interest map for information retrieval (Scholtes, 1993). In addition to encoding the documents based on their words, Scholtes has used character n-grams 16 in the encoding. This approach has also been adopted in <ref> (Hyotyniemi, 1996) </ref>. Merkl (1993; 1994; 1995a; 1995b; 1997; Merkl et al., 1994) has used the SOM to cluster textual descriptions of software library components based on similar principles. Some of the experiments have been based on the use of hierarchical SOMs (see Chapter 2).

Reference-contexts: grammar (Lehtola and Valkonen, 1986; Valkonen et al., 1987), semantical analysis that used a set of tree transformation rules to transform the dependency tree into a tree of predicate structures (Lehtola and Honkela, 1988; Honkela, 1989), and finally a two-stage database query formulation that first produced a system-independent query expression <ref> (Hyotyniemi and Lehtola, 1988) </ref>, and finally then formed the query (Hyotyniemi and Lehtola, 1991). Special-purpose formalisms and metatools were developed during the project (e.g., Lehtola et al., 1988b; Lehtola et al., 1988a).

The approach was mainly grounded on rule-based formalisms that proved to be practical in the tasks of syntactic analysis. A major problem arose in the semantical analysis.

Reference-contexts: The recognition rate for a large English corpus, when parsing new unrestricted running text and after a morphological analysis by the two-level model, is approximately 98%, i.e., only 2 words out of 100 get the wrong syntactic code <ref> (Jarvinen, 1994) </ref>. When the analysis concerning the structure and content of natural lan-guage expressions is considered, one key factor for quantitative problems is the combinatorial explosion caused by the contextuality of interpretation at the semantic level. <p> Ambiguity further increases the necessity of taking the context into account in order to make rational interpretations 2 . In a 500 000 word sample, <ref> (Jarvinen, 1994) </ref> reports an ambiguity rate of 16.4%, i.e., 16 words out of 100 have more than one morphological or syntactic interpretation. * There exist several reasons for which a natural-language database interface is prone to fail.

Reference-contexts: Further argumentation for these conclusions will be given in Chapter 3. The experiences described above called for a completely new paradigm for approximate semantic analysis of natural language expressions. It turned out that the Self-Organizing Map formalism <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref> might provide means to cope with the qualitative and quantitative problems described earlier. In this thesis, the Self-Organizing Map will be introduced in Chapter 2. <p> The locations of the responses in the array tend to become ordered in the learning process as if some meaningful nonlinear coordinate system for the different input features were being created over the network <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref>. The SOM was developed by Prof. Teuvo Kohonen in the early 1980s (Kohonen, 1981a; 1981b; 1981c; 1981d; 1982a; 1982b). <p> In practical applications, however, the model vectors are more profitably initialized in some orderly fashion, e.g., along a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the two principal eigenvectors of the input data vectors <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref>. Moreover, a batch version of the SOM algorithm may also be used (Kohonen, 1995c). Any input item is thought to be mapped into the location, the m i (t) of which matches best with x (t) in some metric. <p> In practical applications, however, the model vectors are more profitably initialized in some orderly fashion, e.g., along a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the two principal eigenvectors of the input data vectors <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref>. Moreover, a batch version of the SOM algorithm may also be used (Kohonen, 1995c). Any input item is thought to be mapped into the location, the m i (t) of which matches best with x (t) in some metric. The self-organizing algorithm creates the ordered mapping as a repetition of the following basic tasks: 1. <p> A number of details about the selection of the parameters, variants of the map, and many other aspects have been covered in the monograph <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref>. The aim of this work is not to study or expound the mathematical and statistical properties of the SOM. <p> There exist a number of variants of the SOM in which, e.g., the adaptation rules are different, various distance measures can be used, and the structure of the map interconnections is variable <ref> (Kohonen, 1995c) </ref>. 4. The SOM is widely used as a data mining and visualization method for complex data sets. Application areas include, for instance, image processing and speech recognition, process control, economical analysis, and 20 diagnostics in industry and in medicine.

Reference-contexts: Application areas include, for instance, image processing and speech recognition, process control, economical analysis, and 20 diagnostics in industry and in medicine. A summary of the engineering applications of the SOM is given in <ref> (Kohonen et al., 1996c) </ref>. Some applications require efficient construction of large maps. Searching the best-matching unit is usually the computationally heaviest operation in the SOM. Using a tree-structured SOM, it is possible to use hierarchical search for the best match (Koikkalainen and Oja, 1990; Koikkalainen, 1994).

The two-level model is generally applicable over various languages and language families. Thus, prototypes of the two-level model have been implemented for over 30 languages.

Reference-contexts: The status or necessity of fuzzy logic has been questioned, e.g., by many traditional logicians (see, e.g., Haack, 1996).

Reference-contexts: Unsupervised learning can be used to learn the fuzzy descriptions of input data (Dickerson and Kosko, 1997). Using SOMs to learn descriptions of impreciseness of natural language is also the topic of Publication 1. The SOM is considered as a fuzzy classifier by Mitra and Pal (1994) <ref> (see also Mitra and Pal, 1996) </ref>. Tirri (1991) and Leivian (1997) use the SOM to preprocess data before further processing by symbolic AI methods (rule-based expert systems, inductive learning). Beyond fuzzy logic: inherently non-symbolic representations The possibility of abandoning the predetermined discrete, symbolic features is worth consideration 10 .

Reference-contexts: The model consists of two main parts: the maps for the 27 lexical symbols in the different input and output modalities, and the map for the lexical semantics. A thorough framework for connectionist modeling of aphasia is presented in <ref> (Persson, 1995) </ref>. Scholtes has also used the SOM to parsing (Scholtes, 1992a; Scholtes and Bloemberger, 1992). An overall presentation is given in (Scholtes, 1993). In (Schutze, 1992) cooccurence information is used to create lexical spaces. Here, the dimensionality reduction is based on singular value decomposition.

Reference-contexts: At the level of semantics and pragmatics, the contextuality may be considered to be more important: the final interpretation of an expression is determined in the context in which it appears. In addition, specific models that capture compositionality have been developed, e.g., RAAM, Recurrent Auto-Associative Memory <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. Moreover, 5 A definition of semantics and pragmatics that would be widely accepted is somewhat difficult to give. Levinson (1983) gives multiple possible definitions.

Reference-contexts: This method, however, is only practicable in small experiments. With a vocabulary picked from a even reasonably large corpus the dimensionality of the vectors would become intolerably high. If the vocabulary is large, the word forms can be encoded by quasi-orthogonal random vectors of a much smaller dimensionality <ref> (Ritter and Kohonen, 1989) </ref>. Such random vectors can still be considered to be sufficiently dissimilar mutually and not to convey any information about the meaning of the words. The influence of the random vector dimension on the pairwise deviance from the orthogonality is illustrated in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: If the color is provided for both maps the less detailed model can be refined. Further discussion can be found in Publication 2. When the input vector contains both context and symbol parts the degree of supervision can be moderated (controlled) using a single weight parameter <ref> (Ritter and Kohonen, 1990) </ref>. In creating word category maps the symbol part of the input vector is normally scaled so that it does not significantly contribute to the ordering of the map.

Reference-contexts: Various Boolean logic expressions can be formulated to control the breadth of matching. For instance, instead of a simple list of terms, the query can be based on a Boolean expression of the terms. The following three basic problems make it difficult to apply Boolean logic to text retrieval <ref> (see, e.g., Salton, 1989) </ref>. (1) Recall and precision 15 of retrieval is sensitive to small changes in formulation of a query.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is to teach small "context maps" so that the main SOM can process the contextual information into clusters. Each model vector of the single-word maps corresponds to a particular "sense" of the word. The SOM is used to resolve ambiguity in <ref> (Scholtes, 1992b) </ref>. Gallant (1991) has also developed a neural network based approach for word sense disambiguation.

Reference-contexts: Scholtes has applied the SOM in multiple NLP experiments. His main area is information retrieval <ref> (Scholtes, 1993) </ref>. Miikkulainen has widely used the SOM to create a model of story comprehension. The SOM is used to make conceptual analysis of the words appearing in the phrases (Miikkulainen, 1990a; 1990b; 1991; 1993a; 1993b; Miikkulainen and Dyer, 1991) . <p> A thorough framework for connectionist modeling of aphasia is presented in (Persson, 1995). Scholtes has also used the SOM to parsing (Scholtes, 1992a; Scholtes and Bloemberger, 1992). An overall presentation is given in <ref> (Scholtes, 1993) </ref>. In (Schutze, 1992) cooccurence information is used to create lexical spaces. Here, the dimensionality reduction is based on singular value decomposition. In computing the context vectors, the window sizes are 1000 or 1200 characters rather than a fixed number of words. <p> The inverse document frequency is the inverse of the number of documents in which the term occurs (Salton et al., 1975; Salton, 1989). Scholtes has developed, based on the SOM, a neural filter and a neural interest map for information retrieval <ref> (Scholtes, 1993) </ref>. In addition to encoding the documents based on their words, Scholtes has used character n-grams 16 in the encoding. This approach has also been adopted in (Hyotyniemi, 1996).

Reference-contexts: The formalisms based on predicate logic contain predicates and their arguments (to model static structures of entities and their relations), logical connectives and quantifiers, and implications (to model rule-like phenomena and dependencies). Semantic networks and frame systems share the underlying ontological assumption. See, e.g., <ref> (Winston, 1984) </ref> for an overview of the "classical" AI techniques. Their influence on the models and metaphors used in cognitive science is also substantial, see, e.g., (Eysenck and Keane, 1990) for a textbook account.
