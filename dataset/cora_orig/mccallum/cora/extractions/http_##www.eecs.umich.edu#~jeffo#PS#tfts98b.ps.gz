Title: TWO EXCURSIONS INTO THE QUARTIC DOMAIN  
Author: Jeffrey C. O'Neill and Patrick Flandrin 
Address: 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, FRANCE  
Affiliation: Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon  
Abstract: In this paper, we derive two quartic functions of the signal that provide results that are not obtainable with quadratic functions. The first is a shift covariant time-frequency distribution that perfectly localizes quadratic chirps, and the second is a shift covariant distribution of time and chirp-rate. These distributions provide very interesting results for single component signals, but have complications for multi-component signals.

In a similar fashion, one could consider c i (t) = (t) to be the instantaneous chirp-rate of the signal.

These results are closely related to the polynomial Wigner dis tributions of Boashash and O'Shea <ref> [3] </ref>. The main differences are that Boashash and O'Shea derived a single, sixth order function that localizes quadratic chirps (and also cubic chirps), whereas we have an infinite number of distributions specified by a single pa rameter that are fourth order (quartic).

A TIME-CHIRP DISTRIBUTION Consider the time-shift and chirp-shift operators: (T t o x)(t) = x (t t o ) jc o t 2 =2 According to the results of Baraniuk <ref> [9] </ref> there do not exist quadratic distributions covariant to these two operators since these two oper ators are unitarily equivalent to neither time-shift and frequency-shift nor to time-shift and scale. However, we will derive a quartic function covariant to these two operators.
