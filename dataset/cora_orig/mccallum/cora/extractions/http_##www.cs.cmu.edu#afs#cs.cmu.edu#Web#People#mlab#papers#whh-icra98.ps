Title: Experiments in Impulsive Manipulation

Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of our experimental effort in one form of impulsive manipulation: tapping. Our previous work studied the mechanics of tapping a planar object which then slides on a support surface, coming to rest due to friction. This work addresses the practical issues in creating a system which uses this mode of manipulation. We begin with the design of tapping devicesend effectors designed to deliver an impulse to an object, and report some of the issues we have found to be important in their design. Our next step was to perform single-tap experiments in order to fit and evaluate the models of impact and sliding. These experiments have shown that objects rotate less than predicted; we have found that the addition of a scaling factor for the torque due to friction enables the models to predict object motion reasonably well. In order to do positioning experiments, we developed a number of planning methods (or feedback control strategies) to compensate for errors in modeling, parameters, and actuation. These planning methods were successfully used to demonstrate a positioning task. We also have experimentally demonstrated that tapping can be used to position an object more precisely than the manipulator can position the tapping device. We offer some sensitivity analysis in support of this result.

More recently, Yamagata and Higuchi [7] have developed a piezoelectric device to deliver impulsive forces for micropositioning of optical sensors.

Reference-contexts: Tapping, although a discrete rather than continuous process, is nonholonomic in the sense that a tap can only produce transitions in state space in a certain range of directions. We must in general plan a sequence of taps to accomplish a positioning task. Huang <ref> [3] </ref> showed that any configuration can be reached within two taps. However, for practical purposes, the minimum-tap plan may not be the best plan. <p> This work draws from a number of other areas, including friction, impact, nonprehensile manipulation, minimalism, parts feeding, and robotic juggling. The results presented in this paper appear in greater detail in Huang <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Design of a tapping device A tapping device designed for manipulation should be able to deliver an adjustable amount of impulse to the object (both in the normal and tangential directions), should be as consistent and repeatable as possible, and should produce a clean impact (i.e. should not push

Reference-contexts: In this work, we have explored the first approach. Our previous work (Huang et al. <ref> [4] </ref>) analyzed the me chanics of tapping, showing how to strike an object in order to achieve a given displacement (translation and rotation). <p> It was our intuition that a real experimental setup would be close enough to these models to allow feedback control to compensate for any modeling error and for errors in object parameters. Huang et al. <ref> [4] </ref> assumed that objects were axisymmetric (rotationally symmetric); in these experiments, we have used circular objects and objects that, while not axisymmetric, are nearly so. Our experimental effort began with the design and construction of a device to deliver a controlled impact. <p> Our work builds upon that of Voyenli and Eriksen [6] who analyzed the physics of sliding rotating disks and rings and upon that of Goyal et al. [1] who have studied the dynamic behavior of planar sliders.
