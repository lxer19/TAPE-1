Abstract: Clustering is an attractive scheme for churn analysis since marketing experts tend to think of customers as lying in distinct groups. In this paper, we describe a clustering solution to churn analysis. We used the data set provided in the Stanford University MLC++ library of telecommunications customer churn in formation. We clustered this data using ACPro (an enhanced version of AutoClass developed by Ultimode Systems). We found that clustering customer churn data complemented the understanding of the data. This is contrast to tools which require a marketing expert to rethink their understanding of the data. In addition, in this paper we show that clustering allows a marketing expert to understand why customers churn this allows pre-emptive strategies to be developed rather than reactive ones. ACPro was able to provide information about customer churn in telecommunications not available from other data mining products.

Reference-contexts: This is shown to be an effective tool for market understanding and churn prediction. ACPro is a data mining tool developed by Ultimode Systems. It is based on the popular research tools AutoClass <ref> (Cheeseman & Stutz 1995) </ref>, developed at NASA AMES and Snob (Wallace & Boulton 1968), developed at Monash University, Australia. ACPro provides automatic discovery of clusters within data sets. This model building tool is a commercial, robust implementation of probabilistic clustering and simple probabilistic networks.

Reference-contexts: There is clearly a gap in the market for a tool that provides good understanding and gives good predictions. Instead of the mutually exclusive tradeoffs present in traditional data-mining methods, ACPro 1 uses a technique known as clustering <ref> (Titterington, Smith & Makov 1985) </ref>. This is shown to be an effective tool for market understanding and churn prediction. ACPro is a data mining tool developed by Ultimode Systems.

Unlike other clustering systems, ACPro discovers the optimal number of clusters without requiring user specification.
