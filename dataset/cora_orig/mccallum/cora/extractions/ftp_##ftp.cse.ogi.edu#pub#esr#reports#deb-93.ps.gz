Abstract: In many real world applications (even in banking), imprecise data is a matter of fact. However, classic database management systems provide little if any help in the management of imprecise data. We are applying methods from interval arithmetic, epsilon serializability, and other related areas to help the application designers in the management of naturally imprecise data. Our approach includes operators on imprecise data that give bounds on the result imprecision and algorithms that constrain the imprecision propagation in the database.

One of the most common and useful forms of information available to an application designer is the ability to bound the amount of imprecision or error in the value of a data item.

Reference-contexts: We limit our discussion here to the select operation. (Other interval relational algebra operators are discussed in <ref> [BP93] </ref>.) The syntax of the select operation at level of precision P applied to an interval relation I with selection condition C is: SELECT C (I) with precision P . The selection condition C is a Boolean expression specified on the attributes of interval relation I. <p> Many applications often require query capabilities involving aggregate and statistical functions. The interval representation allows for a natural definition of a full range of aggregate functions over imprecise data: max, min, mean, count, avg, sum, and product, based on interval arithmetic. We discuss this in detail in <ref> [BP93] </ref>. 4 Bounding the Imprecision on Data When a data element acquires imprecision due either to external directive, or from the result of a transaction (e.g., update operations), importing and exporting imprecise values, we would like the DBMS to update and maintain bounds on the amount of imprecision introduced for each

Reference-contexts: An important class of examples is the scientific data such as incomplete recording of data, instrument noise, measurement error, computational model imprecision, and data aggregation of one kind or another. Another example is the "fuzzy" data managed by Epsilon Serial-izability algorithms <ref> [PL91, DP93] </ref>. In these cases, the application designer is left with the unpleasant decision whether to ignore the imprecise information and store some approximation to the precise value, or to manage the imprecision by hand. <p> Efficient divergence control algorithms [PHK + 93] guarantee epsilon serializability at a cost close to that of classic concurrency control algorithms, from which the divergence control algorithms were derived. In addition to transaction control, consistency restoration algorithms <ref> [DP93] </ref> can reduce the inconsistency introduced into the database, given some information on the correction of data values. Divergence control and consistency restoration both support the interval notation of data imprecision. <p> The ability to represent and manage both imprecision and uncertainty in a database has considerable promise for many practical applications such as scientific data management. Ongoing research on Epsilon Serializability has produced divergence control algorithms [WYP92, PHK + 93] and consistency restoration algorithms <ref> [DP93] </ref> that preserve bounded inconsistency in data. Queries on data with bounded inconsistency can be formulated easily using our interval algebra. We are actively investigating other aspects of managing imprecision as well as methods to manage uncertainty information, and expect to incorporate both into our system in the future.
