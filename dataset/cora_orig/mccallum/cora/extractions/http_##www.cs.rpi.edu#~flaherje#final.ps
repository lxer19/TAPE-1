Abstract: Several project themes follow. You may either develop one of these into a project or choose a project of your own. The themes are only guidelines and additional enhancement and focus will be needed to form a project. Thus, regardless of whether you choose to do a project from the list or develop one of your own, you should write a two page proposal describing your intended work and submit it on the due date. The faculty will either suggest additional material or limit the scope of your project. A two-page progress report is due about one month after the proposal submission. It should indicate accomplishments to that date and any problems encountered. You may work alone or with a partner. Projects must contain some computational work, but may be a combination of theory and computation. The computational part can either develop new software or use existing software to address an application. In the latter case, a project may seek to explore the properties or capabilities of software in particular circumstances. Final project submissions should have the form of a journal article. Thus, for example, it should contain sections introducing the general topic, describing the problem to be solved, discussing the techniques used to address the problem, analyzing the results, and discussing the findings. Source code should either be includes with a sample application or a reference to the code should be given with sample data. Projects should be self contained and not reference the proposal or the progress report. All other references should be cited. Project length will vary depending on the subject and the amount of computation performed; however, typical lengths have been 20-30 double spaced typed and formatted pages. Your completed final project must be handed in by 9:00 AM on the due date. 1. Nested dissection is One of the most successful direct strategies for solving large sparse linear algebraic systems. It can be regarded as a way to order equations and unknowns to minimize fill in. It has been proven to be optimal under certain conditions. George and Liu (1981) and Duff et al. (1986) describe nested dissection along with many other ordering strategies. You might also read George's (1973) paper on nested dissection. (Although the title implies a knowledge of finite element methods, this is not the case.) You can develop a project to describe the method and apply it to some model problems. Software may be available for those who are not fond of coding. You might check NetLib or other network resources. On the other hand, if coding is your thing, you can develop dissection procedures of your own.
