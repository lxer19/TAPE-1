Reference-contexts: We now apply the fact that a (M OD p k ) d -circuit of s inputs can be represented as a polynomial over Z p of degree D in s variables, where D only depends on k and d: (See, for example, Beigel and Tarui <ref> [3] </ref>.) As Z p is a subfield of F; we can compose this polynomial with the representations of the M OD B m - gates to obtain a representation for the circuit. <p> for some A f0; 1; : : : ; mp t 1g: Considering these as functions with values in F; we have M OD A X M OD mp t X M OD fa mod mg fa mod p t g It follows from a result in Beigel and Tarui <ref> [3] </ref> that M OD fa mod p t g p t is repre sented by a polynomial over Z p of degree p t 1: (Actually, for our purposes, any polynomial representation of degree 2 O (d) will suffice.)

Reference-contexts: As is well known, every function f : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g can be represented by a polynomial over Z p in n variables, where no variable appears in any monomial to a power higher than 1. (See, for example, Smolensky <ref> [8] </ref>.) The variable x i itself represents a function from f0; 1g n into f0; 1g that is also given by the expression ! x i 1 ; which has weight 2.
