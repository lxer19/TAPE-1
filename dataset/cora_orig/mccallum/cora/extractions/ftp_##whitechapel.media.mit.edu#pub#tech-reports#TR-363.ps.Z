Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory, Perceptual Computing Technical Report #363 January 1996, Appears in: ICPR'96 Vienna, Austria August 1996 Abstract We describe a method for estimation of 3-D geometry from 2-D blob features. Blob features are clusters of similar pixels in the image plane and can arise from similarity of color, texture, motion and other signal-based metrics. The motivation for considering such features comes from recent successes in real-time extraction and tracking of such blob features in complex cluttered scenes in which traditional feature finders fail|scenes containing moving people, for example. We use nonlinear modeling and a combination of iterative and recursive estimation methods to recover 3-D geometry from blob correspondences across multiple images. The 3-D geometry includes the 3-D shapes, translations, and orientations of blobs and the relative orientation of the cameras. Using this technique, we have developed a real-time wide-baseline stereo person tracking system which can self-calibrate itself from watching a moving person and can subsequently track people's head and hands with RMS errors of 1-2 cm in translation and 2 degrees in rotation. The blob formulation is efficient and reliable, running at 20-30 Hz on a pair of SGI Indy R4400 workstations with no special hardware.

Introduction This paper describes a method for estimation of 3-D geometry from blob features and evaluates the performance of a real-time self-calibrating stereo person tracker that uses the estimator.

Reference-contexts: Background: Blob features The notion of grouping atomic parts of a scene together to form blob-like entities based on proximity and visual appearance is a natural one, and has been of interest to visual scientists since the Gestalt psychologists studied grouping criteria early in this century <ref> [2] </ref>. In modern computer vision processing we seek to group pixels of images together and to "segment" images based on visual coherence, but the "features" obtained from such efforts are usually taken to be the boundaries, or contours, of these regions rather than the regions themselves.

Reference-contexts: We have a forward model, y = f (x), so we can develop a cost function based on the error e (x; y) = y f (x). We also have the Jacobian J (x) analytically, so we have available to us many forms of nonlinear estimation techniques <ref> [8, 9, 3] </ref>. We use a form of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for the static self-calibration problem and a form of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the dynamic problem of tracking motion and shape.

These are clustered into blobs which drive a "connected-blob" representation of the person. <p> Experimental analysis The motivating application for us has been tracking people in 3-D in uncontrived environments, such as an office environment. We have developed a simple blob tracker based on the ideas presented in <ref> [12] </ref> that gives us reliable 2-D blobs of a person's face and hands in real-time. This tracker operating independently on two cameras in a wide-baseline configuration gives us correspondences that we can use to self-calibrate the stereo system and track people's movement and gestures at the same time.
