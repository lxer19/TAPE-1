Abstract: An improvement of the Active Shape procedure identifying new examples of previously learned shapes using the point distribution model is presented. The novel segmentation and interpretation approach incorporates a priori knowledge about the objects of interest and their specific structural relationships to provide robust segmentation and labeling. The method was utilized to successfully identify 10 neuroanatomic structures in 19 individual MR images and 2 car classes (left-right and right left oriented) in 400 perspective images of street scenes.

Reference-contexts: For the two applications reported here the parameters were: scaling in the range [0.9, 1.1], step 0.1 (both applications); rotation [-8 o , 8 o ], step 4 o (brain model) and [-4 o , 4 o ] (car model); and translation <ref> [-4, 4] </ref> pixels, step 1 pixel in both x, y directions (brain model) respectively [-128, 128] pixels (car model). Each hypothesis represents a rigid transform of the average shape, and all generated hypotheses are sequentially evaluated using the model fitting function and the best fit is determined.

Reference-contexts: Also note the good detection of the occluded cars in the background. As a matter of fact, all cars exhibiting less than 40% occlusion were successfully detected. The car segmentation results represent a substantial improvement over a recently published study <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 Discussion We expect further improvement of the method's performance by incorporating better structure positioning information. At this moment, no explicit statistical information is used concerning the relative positions of the objects.
