Title: A Note on Embedding Complete Graphs into Hypercubes  
Author: Michel Goemans Michael Klugerman Alexander Russell Ravi Sundaram 
Date: October 19, 1995  
Abstract: An embedding of K n into a hypercube is a mapping of the n vertices of K n to distinct vertices of the hypercube, and the associated cost is the sum over all pairs of (mapped) vertices of the Hamming distance between the vertices. Let f(n) denote the minimum cost over all embeddings of K n into a hypercube (of any dimension). In this note we prove that f (n) = (n 1) 2 , unless n = 4 or n = 8, in which case f (n) = (n 1) 2 1. As an application, we use this theorem to derive an alternate proof of the fact that the Isolation Heuristic (and the accompanying variant) for the Multiway Cut problem of [DJP+ 92] is tight for all k.

Reference-contexts: In the n-Way Cut we are given an edge-weighted graph and n distinguished vertices called terminals and asked for a minimum weight set of edges that separates every terminal pair. This problem is simply the min-cut max-flow problem when n = 2. In <ref> [DJP+ 92] </ref> it was shown that the problem becomes hard for n = 3. They also gave a simple approximation algorithm, the Isolation Heuristic, for arbitrary graphs that came within a factor of 2 (1 1=n) of the optimal.
