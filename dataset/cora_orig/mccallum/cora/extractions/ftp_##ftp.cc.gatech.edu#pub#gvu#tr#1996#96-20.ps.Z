Abstract: Technical Report GIT-GVU-96-20 September 1996 Abstract A number of studies have found that using animation for explaining dynamic systems had less beneficial effects on learning than hoped. Those results come as a surprise to many instructors and students in computer science where animation is becoming an increasingly popular tool for teaching algorithms. This study takes an ethnomethodological approach, observing students using animations and other media to learn about an algorithm. We do not answer the question, "Do animations aid learning?" nor the question "How do they aid learning?" Rather, we gain some insight into how animations can fit into successful learning strategies. Finally, we present several key observations that we hope educators and researchers can use to inform their own work with algorithm animation.

Reference-contexts: In addition, students using animations reported that they felt the animations assisted them in understanding the algorithm [SBL93]. Imagine the surprise of students and instructors when empirical research about the benefits of animation (in computer science education and elsewhere) began to show disappointing results <ref> [RBA90, PE91, SBL93, BCS96] </ref>. Rieber, Boyce and Assad conducted a study in 1990 [RBA90] using a computer-based science lesson to teach introductory Newtonian mechanics to adults. <p> Students just learning about an algorithm do not have a foundation of understanding upon which to construct the visualization mapping. " A more recent study conducted by Byrne, Catrambone, and Stasko (BCS) <ref> [BCS96] </ref> also found limited effects for undergraduates using interactive animations. The study examined the relation of animation to evoking predictions in students. In learning new algorithms, some students viewed animations and some were prompted to make predictions about an algorithm's operation on novel data sets.

Reference-contexts: What that "something" is and how to reduce the "difficulty" are two problems whose solutions are anxiously awaited by many students and instructors. Meanwhile, guided mainly by intuition, instructors have been looking toward algorithm animation <ref> [Bro88] </ref> as a tool to help their students learn. It is certainly possible to learn about an algorithm without using an animation, but to many it seems almost obvious that students could learn faster and more thoroughly with one.

Reference-contexts: Binomial trees of equal sizes are combined to make larger trees. The data structure is appealing because all three of its fundamental operations run in logarithmic time. For more details on binomial heaps and their operations, consult any comprehensive computer science algorithms text such as <ref> [CLR90] </ref>. 3 Three students participated in the observational study, all volunteers and all graduate students at the Georgia Institute of Technology. They had had little or no exposure to binomial heaps, but all had taken undergraduate and graduate level algorithms courses. <p> Because of these qualifications, we considered these students "expert learners" and assumed that they have developed successful strategies for learning new material. The material on binomial heaps was adapted from a popular algorithms textbook <ref> [CLR90] </ref> and presented on a page on the World Wide Web. Hotlinks in the text to relevant animations allowed the textual material to be tightly integrated with the animations. When reading about a particular operation, students could simply click on a hotlink to bring up an animation demonstrating the operation.

Reference-contexts: Students who saw the animation and listened to the narration simultaneously outperformed all other groups on a creative-problem-solving test. They explain this effect with the "integrated dual-code hypothesis, adapted from Paivio's dual-coding theory <ref> [Pai71, Pai90, CP91] </ref>, [which] posits that learners can build both visual and verbal modes of mental representations as well as connections between them." The claim is that presenting the animation and narration serially does not allow students to build referential connections between the two presentations.

Reference-contexts: Mayer claims that the labeled illustrations played two roles: guiding students attention and helping them build internal connections (i.e. connections between ideas in the text, as opposed to connections to previous knowledge). Another set of experiments in 1991 with Anderson <ref> [MA91] </ref>, considered the use of animations to help students understand scientific explanations. In two experiments, college students without mechanical knowledge viewed animations and/or listened to narrations explaining the operation of a bicycle pump.

Reference-contexts: Results from the early experiments, using only static illustrations, showed that students who viewed labeled illustrations showed better explanative recall and problem-solving transfer than students who saw only labels or illustrations or neither <ref> [May89] </ref>.

The animations were implemented using the POLKA animation system <ref> [SK93] </ref>. Three animations were available to students: one illustrated the combination of two small binomial trees into a larger tree and the other two illustrated the extract-minimum and union operations. Each animation was modeled after a series of original static illustrations from the textbook.
