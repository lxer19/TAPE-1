Title: The Rate Mismatch Problem in Heterogeneous ABR Flow Control  
Author: Nina Taft Plotkin Jaroslaw J. Sydir

Abstract: Because the ATM Forum does not standardize the ABR flow control algorithm that an ATM switch should run, some ATM networks are likely to contain switches that run different ABR flow control algorithms. Even if all the switches within a "cloud" of switches use the same algorithm, individual clouds (each with its own algorithm) will be interconnected by virtual circuits. Virtual circuits which traverse multiple clouds will therefore be controlled by two different flow control algorithms concurrently. In this paper we explore some of the ramifications of mixing different flow control algorithms in the same ATM network. We identify the rate mismatch problem, which arises when a nonbottleneck switch (that uses one algorithm) interferes with the control of the bottleneck switch (that uses another algorithm). We formulate a hypothesis that states the conditions that lead to the rate mismatch problem. These conditions identify a specific class of problematic topologies. We validate the hypothesis formally and prove that rate mismatch causes unfairness. Using four different algorithms, in combinations of two at a time, we illustrate the interoperability of ABR flow control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In the descriptions that follow below, let Q denote the current queue occupancy, measured at the time an RM cell is marked. Relative Rate Marking Algorithm This algorithm (which we henceforth refer to as the RRM algorithm) is suggested by the ATM Forum <ref> [1] </ref> as a potential single bit feedback scheme. We use a version of this algorithm with two queue thresholds (rather than one). It uses the CI bit and NI bit to control a source's ACR. A switch updates the fields, in the backwards RM cells it receives, as follows. <p> The algorithm is a variation of ATM Forum suggestions I.5.2.1, "EPRCA," and I.5.2.5, "ER based on bandwidth Demand Estimate Algorithm," as they appear in the ATM Forum Traffic Management Specification Version 4.0 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> This algorithm is essentially equivalent to the Bounded MACR algo rithm with fl = 1. ERICA+ Algorithm The ERICA+ algorithm [5] is a variation of the ER-ICA algorithm that was originally proposed by Raj Jain et al. and appeared as the ATM Forum suggestion I.5.2.3 <ref> [1] </ref>. Both algorithms periodically measure the ABR input rate and attempt to direct this rate towards a target rate. The original ERICA algorithm performs the following computations at the end of each measurement interval.

Reference-contexts: Our study focuses on heterogeneous topologies. When two different algorithms coexist in a heterogeneous topology, they may try to control the same VCs simultaneously. This scenario raises the question of whether the goals of ABR flow control (max-min fairness <ref> [2] </ref>, no loss, and high throughput) can be achieved when two distinct algorithms coexist in the same network. Two algorithms that coexist in a network are said to cooperate if the goals of ABR flow control are still achieved. We conducted this study to address the following interoperability questions.

Reference-contexts: We call this version of the MACR algorithm, the Unbounded MACR algorithm, because it can allow the source's rate to grow all the way to its peak. This algorithm is essentially equivalent to the Bounded MACR algo rithm with fl = 1. ERICA+ Algorithm The ERICA+ algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> is a variation of the ER-ICA algorithm that was originally proposed by Raj Jain et al. and appeared as the ATM Forum suggestion I.5.2.3 [1]. Both algorithms periodically measure the ABR input rate and attempt to direct this rate towards a target rate. <p> The remainder of the calculations are performed in the same way as in ERICA. (See <ref> [5] </ref> for a detailed description of ERICA+, and a number of recent improvements to ERICA and ERICA+.) We implemented the following: "innovation to achieve max-min fairness", "fairshare first to avoid transient overloads", and "forward CCR used for reverse direction feedback".
