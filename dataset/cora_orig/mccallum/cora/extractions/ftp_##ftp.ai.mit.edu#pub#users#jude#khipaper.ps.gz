Reference-contexts: But we are looking for the best constants A p and B p that satisfy the inequality for all natural numbers n. For all p, a solution and proof was given in <ref> [1] </ref>. Here we present another proof, for p &gt; 3, which uses only elementary calculus. Proof Because of the homogeneity of the inequality, we may assume that P n i = 1. <p> the " sequence, f" i g n i=3 : n X " i ff ; i and with k () = (1 )ff 2 2 = (ff 2 1 ) + ff 2 l () = (1 )ff 2 1 = (ff 2 2 ) + ff 2 and 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Note that k (0) = ff 1 , l (0) = ff 2 , and k () 2 + l () 2 = ff 2 1 + ff 2 2 [0; 1]. Because ff 2 6= 0, k () and l () are not zero-functions. <p> 2 l () = (1 )ff 2 1 = (ff 2 2 ) + ff 2 and 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Note that k (0) = ff 1 , l (0) = ff 2 , and k () 2 + l () 2 = ff 2 1 + ff 2 2 [0; 1]. Because ff 2 6= 0, k () and l () are not zero-functions.
