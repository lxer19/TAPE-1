Reference: [Brad88] <editor> Braden, R., Borman, D., Partridge, C., </editor> <title> "Computing the Internet Checksum", </title> <type> RFC 1071, </type> <month> September </month> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: The Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of the DVMRP message. The checksum MUST be calculated upon transmission and MUST be validated on reception of a packet. The checksum of the DVMRP message should be calculated with the checksum field set to zero. See <ref> [Brad88] </ref> for more information. 3.2. Probe Messages When a DVMRP router is configured to run on an interface (physical or tunnel), it multicasts DVMRP Probe packets to inform other DVMRP routers that it is operational. Effectively, they serve three purposes. 1.

Reference-contexts: The maximum packet length of any DVMRP message should be the maximum packet size required to be forwarded without fragmenting. The use of Path MTU Discovery [Mogu90] is encouraged to determine this size. In the absence of Path MTU, the Requirements for Internet Hosts <ref> [Brad89] </ref> specifies this number as 576 octets. Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4.

Reference-contexts: Reverse Path Multicasting Datagrams follow multicast delivery trees from a source to all members of a multicast group <ref> [Deer89] </ref>, replicating the packet only at necessary branches in the delivery tree. The trees are calculated and updated dynamically to track the membership of individual groups.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction DVMRP uses a distance vector distributed routing algorithm in order to build per-source-group multicast delivery trees. A good introduction to distance vector routing can be found in [Perl92]. The application of distance vector routing to multicast tree formulation is described in <ref> [Deer91] </ref>. 1.1. Requirements Terminology The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119]. 1.2.
Reference: [Fen97a] <author> Fenner, W., </author> <title> "Internet Group Management Protocol, </title> <type> Version 2", RFC 2236, </type> <month> November </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: If the downstream interface under consideration is a leaf network (has no dependent downstream neighbors for the source network), then the IGMP local group database must be consulted. The IGMP local group database is maintained by all IP multicast routers on each physical, multicast capable network <ref> [Fen97a] </ref>. If the destination group address is listed in the local group database, and the router is the designated forwarder for the source, then the interface is included in the list of downstream interfaces. <p> Protocol Header DVMRP packets are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an IP protocol number of 2 (IGMP) as specified in the Assigned Numbers RFC [Reyn94]. All fields are transmitted in Network Byte Order. DVMRP packets use a common protocol header that specifies the IGMP <ref> [Fen97a] </ref> Packet Type as hexadecimal 0x13 (DVMRP). DVMRP protocol packets should be sent with the Precedence field in the IP header set to Internetwork Control (hexadecimal 0xc0 for the Type of Service Octet) [Post81]. <p> Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4. IANA Considerations The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet protocols. DVMRP uses IGMP <ref> [Fen97a] </ref> IP protocol messages to communicate between routers. The IGMP Type field is hexadecimal 0x13. On IP multicast capable networks, DVMRP uses the All-DVMRP-Routers local multicast group. This group address is 224.0.0.4. 5. Network Management Considerations DVMRP provides several methods for network management monitoring and troubleshooting.
Reference: [Fen97b] <author> Fenner, W., Casner, S., </author> <title> "A "traceroute" facility for IP Multicast", </title> <booktitle> Work In Progress, </booktitle> <month> November </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: They were used to specify the PRUNE, GENID, and MTRACE bits. The first two, PRUNE and GENID, are now required features. The MTRACE bit must be set so existing implementations will not assume this neighbor does not support multicast trace-route <ref> [Fen97b] </ref>. However, since this bit is now reserved and set to 1, newer implementations should not use this bit in the Probe message to determine if multicast trace-route is supported by a neighbor. Instead, the M bit should only be used in a Neighbors2 message as described in Appendix B. <p> Appendix B describes a request/response mechanism to directly query DVMRP neighbor information. In addition, a Management Information Base for DVMRP is defined in [Thal97]. A Management Information Base for the multicast forwarding cache is defined in [McCl98]. Also, a protocol independent multicast trace-route facility is defined in <ref> [Fen97b] </ref>. Pusateri [Page 26] INTERNET-DRAFT DVMRP Version 3 August 1998 6. Security Considerations Security for DVMRP follows the general security architecture provided for the Internet Protocol [Ken98a]. This framework provides for both privacy and authentication. It recommends the use of the IP Authentication Header [Ken98b] to provide trusted neighbor relationships.
Reference: [Full93] <author> Fuller, V., T. Li, J. Yu, and K. Varadhan, </author> <title> "Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment and Aggregation Strategy", </title> <type> RFC 1519, </type> <month> September </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: Source Network Aggregation Implementations may wish to provide a mechanism to aggregate source networks to reduce the size of the routing table. All implementations should be able to accept reports for aggregated source networks in accordance with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) as described in [Rekh93] and <ref> [Full93] </ref>. There are two places where aggregation is particularly useful. 1. At organizational boundaries to limit the number of source networks advertised out of the organization. 2. Within an organization to summarize non-local routing information by using a default (0/0) route. <p> This means that the netmask value will always be represented in 3 octets. This method of specifying source network masks is compatible with techniques described in [Rekh93] and <ref> [Full93] </ref> to group traditional Class C networks into super-nets and to allow different subnets of the same Class A network to be discontinuous. It does not, however, allow grouping class A networks into super-nets since the first octet of the netmask is always assumed to be 255.

Reference: [Mogu90] <author> Mogul, J., Deering, S., </author> <note> "Path MTU Discovery", RFC 1191, </note> <month> November </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: In addition, a router configured with multiple addresses on an interface should consistently use the same address when sending DVMRP control messages. The maximum packet length of any DVMRP message should be the maximum packet size required to be forwarded without fragmenting. The use of Path MTU Discovery <ref> [Mogu90] </ref> is encouraged to determine this size. In the absence of Path MTU, the Requirements for Internet Hosts [Brad89] specifies this number as 576 octets. Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4.

Reference-contexts: Note: All protocol messages sent on point-to-point links (including tunnels) should use a destination address of All-DVMRP-Routers. This change will allow the protocol messages to be forwarded across multicast-only tunnels without making encapsulation and decapsulation difficult. In practice, tunnels typically use either IP-IP <ref> [Perk96] </ref> or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [Han94a,Han94b], although, other encapsulation methods are acceptable.

Reference-contexts: Neighbor Discovery Neighbor DVMRP routers are discovered dynamically by sending Neighbor Probe Messages on local multicast capable network interfaces and tunnel pseudo interfaces. These messages are sent periodically to the All-DVMRP-Routers <ref> [Reyn94] </ref> IP Multicast group address. (See Appendix C for backwards compatibility issues.) The IP TTL of these messages MUST be set to 1. Each Neighbor Probe message contains the list of Neighbor DVMRP routers for which Neighbor Probe messages have been received on that interface. <p> It covers sending and receiving of DVMRP messages as well as the generation and maintenance of IP Multicast forwarding cache entries. 3.1. Protocol Header DVMRP packets are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an IP protocol number of 2 (IGMP) as specified in the Assigned Numbers RFC <ref> [Reyn94] </ref>.
