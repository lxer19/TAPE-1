Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A personal communication service (PCS) network <ref> [1] </ref> is a wireless network that provides communication services for PCS subscribers. The service area of a PCS network is partitioned into several sub-areas or cells. Each cell is covered by a radio port. A radio port may serve one or more cells.

Reference-contexts: The service area is partitioned into S square cells. The expected number of portables in a cell is N . A portable resides in a cell for a period of time t (we assume t to be exponentially distributed with mean 1 Mob , as proposed in <ref> [20] </ref>), then move to one of the four neighboring cells with equal probability. The call arrivals to a portable form a Poisson process with the arrival rate . The call holding times have an exponential distribution with mean 1 . <p> simulation model is validated using an analytical model that makes the following assumptions and uses the following notation. 8 * The call arrivals to each portable are a Poisson process. * The portable residual times in a coverage area are exponentially distributed with the mean 1=M ob as suggested in <ref> [20] </ref>. * The call holding time is exponentially distributed with mean 1=. * p f is the forced termination probability (the probability that a hand-off call is blocked). * p o is the probability that a new call is blocked. * p nc is the call incompletion probability.

Reference-contexts: For S &gt; 256 and T &gt; 5 fi 10 4 seconds, the number of events executed is on the order of 10 7 . We have observed between 10 3 and 10 4 events per second in commercial discrete event simulation packages, such as ModSim <ref> [21] </ref> on a high performance engineering workstation, so a simulation of this magnitude will require many hours of CPU time. Moreover, execution times will increase as network complexity and the functionality of the simulator increase. Here, we examine the use of a distributed computing platform to reduce model execution time.

Reference-contexts: The synchronization mechanism ensures that these two messages (which are arrival events to LP B) are executed by LP B in increasing timestamp order. A well-known synchronization mechanism is the Time Warp protocol which uses a detection-and-recovery protocol to synchronize the computation <ref> [22] </ref>. Any time an LP determines that it has processed events out of timestamp order, it rolls back those events, and reexecutes them.

Reference-contexts: Irrevocable operations occurring at simulated times older than GVT can be performed, and storage carrying a timestamp older than GVT can be reclaimed. A version of Time Warp has been developed that executes on a collection of DEC 5000 workstations, Sun Sparc workstations, or a mixture of these machines <ref> [23] </ref>. The Time Warp system is written in C++.

Reference-contexts: Here we will briefly describe some of the features of the distributed Time Warp system. It is anticipated that most simulations will contain far more LPs than processors, so each processor will typically contain hundreds or thousands of LPs. A priority queue data structure called the calendar queue <ref> [24] </ref> is used in each processor to efficiently select the next LP to execute. The processor's scheduler always selects the LP containing the smallest timestamped event as the next one for execution. Each LP includes a linear list to hold the unprocessed events (method invocations) scheduled for that LP.

Reference-contexts: For a detailed performance analysis of PCS models executing on a Time Warp simulator, we refer the reader to <ref> [25] </ref>. This study demonstrates that distributed simulation techniques can effectively speed up the execution of PCS simulation models. With 8 workstations, the execution times are reduced from 20 hours to less than 3.5 hours in many cases.

Reference-contexts: This problem was chosen because (i) PCS networks are likely to be exposed to these types of traffic patterns and it is currently not known what effect they will have on PCS network performance based on traffic patterns already observed in line based networks <ref> [26] </ref>, (ii) this problem is extremely difficult to study using analytic techniques, and (iii) the computing requirements are quite large, because of the large size of the network. Accordingly, this problem is an excellent candidate to attack using the distributed simulation techniques discussed in this article. <p> PLACE FIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE.

Reference-contexts: Using the collected simulation data, we derive linear models for each blocking statistic (p f , p o and p nc ) across the different call hold time distributions (exponential, Pareto, and uniform) for a fixed offer load. All models were obtained using the Splus statistical analysis package <ref> [27] </ref>. Table 1 shows a summary of the different models.

Reference-contexts: The R 2 statistic determines how much of the data's variation is accounted for by the model. 15 For a complete guide to the design of experiments and development of regression models, we refer the reader to <ref> [28] </ref>. In many cases, the linear model accounts for over 99% of the data's variation, making them very good predictors of the blocking statistics. Moreover, we find that the burst level, BL, is the largest contributing factor.
