Reference-contexts: In this generality and if we require solutions to use no additional axioms of set theory, the two problems are still open. However, we shall prove that a strong form of Jensen's diamond principle 3 (still true in the constructible universe; see <ref> [Dev82] </ref>) gives a negative answer to both problems. For example, we shall use the strong diamond to construct for every tree T 2 T with T 0 &lt; T &lt; ! 1 a Souslin tree S such that S 6 T (Theorem 6.9). <p> Theorem 6.12 (See <ref> [Dev82] </ref>) V = L implies 3 + ( 1 &lt;! ).

Reference-contexts: We exhibit in this paper both special and non-special determined Scott trees. In Section 3 we complement results of [HV90] and <ref> [Huu95] </ref> by proving, a among other things, that it is consistent relative to the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, that every Karp tree contains a subtree which is a Karp tree of cardinality 2 ! . <p> A tree of height ! 1 is persistent if each node has extensions of all countable heights. This concept was interoduced by Huuskonen <ref> [Huu95] </ref>, who also proved that the following tree is the -smallest persistent tree: The tree T 0 consists of sequences (t 0 ; : : : ; t n ) of countable ordinals ordered by (t 0 ; : : :; t n ) (s 0 ; : : : ; <p> If T 1 is a Karp tree and T 2 a Scott tree of (A; B), then T 1 T 2 .

In fact, this corollary shows that some quite large cardinals are needed to prove the consistency of the existence of k 0 . <p> The trees A ff Q are Karp trees of (A; B) and they are mutually non-comparable by , as we noted in (Q1). 2 Note that another construction of Karp trees T 1 and T 2 such that T 1 T 2 is not a Karp tree, was presented in <ref> [Huu95] </ref> by Huuskonen. <p> 8ff &lt; ! 1 9t 0 2 T (t t 0 ^ ht (t 0 ) ffg; " d (d ff (T )) (d 0 (T ) = T ); p rank (T ) = least ff such that d ff+1 (T ) = ;: This concept occurs already in <ref> [Huu95] </ref> but in a different form.

Reference-contexts: This quasi-ordering of trees arises naturally in infinitary model theory, especially in the investigation of Ehrenfeucht-Frasse games <ref> [HV90] </ref>. It has also been used to study non-well-founded inductive definitions [OV93]. For a survey of the role of in infinitary logic, see [Vaa95]. The purpose of this paper is to introduce new methods in the study of this ordering. <p> In <ref> [HV90] </ref> it is suggested that trees with no uncountable branches measure similarity of A and B. This is accomplished via the following Ehrenfeucht-Frasse-game EF T (A; B): There are two players 9 and 8. <p> A tree T is a Scott tree of (A; B) if 8 has a winning strategy in EF T (A; B) but not in EF T (A; B). These concepts, introduced in <ref> [HV90] </ref>, arises naturally if one tries to find an uncountable analogue of the concept of Scott-rank of a countable structure. A Scott tree T , which is also a Karp tree, is called a determined Scott tree. <p> We exhibit in this paper both special and non-special determined Scott trees. In Section 3 we complement results of <ref> [HV90] </ref> and [Huu95] by proving, a among other things, that it is consistent relative to the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, that every Karp tree contains a subtree which is a Karp tree of cardinality 2 ! . <p> It turns out that these trees give rise to a rich and interesting family of nonspecial trees, all incomparable with Aronszajn trees. Naturally, these trees are in T only if CH is assumed. The trees T (A) were first studied in [Tod81b]. Later they were used in <ref> [HV90] </ref> to give examples of Scott trees. For stationary A the trees T (A) are all above T 0 and it is interesting to note that the infimum of T (A) and T (B), with A " B nonstationary, is exactly T 0 . <p> = min (s n t i ) for all i j contradicting the assumption that ft i g is strictly decreasing. - 5 - 3 Scott and Karp trees The existence of Scott and Karp trees, as well as their mutual relationship, is established by the following result: Theorem 3.1 <ref> [HV90] </ref> Karp trees and Scott trees exist for any pair (A; B) of non-isomorphic structures of cardinality @ 1 and of the same vocabulary. If T 1 is a Karp tree and T 2 a Scott tree of (A; B), then T 1 T 2 . <p> If T 1 is a Karp tree and T 2 a Scott tree of (A; B), then T 1 T 2 . Apart from this there does not seem to be much order in the families of Scott and Karp trees. See <ref> [HV90] </ref> and [Huu95] for earlier results in this direction. Our first concern in this section is the cardinality of Karp trees. It was pointed out in [HV90] that any Scott tree contains a subtree which is a Scott tree of cardinality 2 ! . <p> Apart from this there does not seem to be much order in the families of Scott and Karp trees. See <ref> [HV90] </ref> and [Huu95] for earlier results in this direction. Our first concern in this section is the cardinality of Karp trees. It was pointed out in [HV90] that any Scott tree contains a subtree which is a Scott tree of cardinality 2 ! . Huuskonen [Huu95] showed that the same need not be true of Karp trees. We show that the same may be true of Karp trees. <p> If 9 does not lose with this strategy, an unaccountable branch is created in R, which is impossible. Claim 4 If 9 has a winning strategy in EF T (A; B), then T is R-embeddable. It was proved in <ref> [HV90] </ref> that Lemma 3.6 If 9 has a winning strategy in EF T (A; B), and 8 has a winning strategy in EF T 0 (A; B), then T T 0 . To prove Claim 4 suppose 9 has a winning strategy in EF T (A; B).

Reference-contexts: Then P ~ = P - fi P -. Let G be P generic. It is well-known that V [G] j= = @ 2 + GCH (see e.g. <ref> [Jec78] </ref>). We prove V [G] j= k 0 = @ 2 . Let A; B 2 V be structures of the same vocabulary and with ! 1 as their universe. We shall later deal with the case A; B 2 V [G]. <p> These trees are mainly interesting in the case that A is bistationary. For example, if A is stationary, then for every ff &lt; ! 1 there is a continuous ascending sequence of length ff of elements of A (see e.g. <ref> [Jec78, page 60] </ref>), whence ht (T (A)) = ! 1 . On the other hand, we do not want A to contain a cub, because then T (A) has an uncountable branch.

Reference-contexts: ! 1 i: Lemma 4.1 T (a) is Aronszajn if and only if a and a form a gap: In fact, one of the standard constructions of an Aronszajn tree essentially consists of a construction of a coherent sequence a so that a and a form a gap (see e.g. <ref> [Kun] </ref>). So we know there are coherent sequences a and b which form a gap. On the other hand, there are also coherent sequences a and b which do not form a gap.

Reference-contexts: Our first method is called -operation. For a partial order P , the tree P is defined as the set of ascending sequences of elements of P , ordered by end-extension. This operation is originally due to Kurepa <ref> [Kur56] </ref> and it was later used and extended by Todorcevic [Tod85, Tod95]. In model theory it was used by Hyttinen [Hyt87]. In Section 2 we demonstrate the versatility of the -operation in providing both universal elements and counter-examples to universality in various classes of structures. <p> Let s : Ord ! A be defined by the condition s (ff) = f (sjff). Then s (ff) 2 A for all ff 2 Ord and ff &lt; fi implies s (ff) 6= s (fi), a contradiction. 2 Kurepa <ref> [Kur56] </ref> proved Theorem 2.3 for posets. Corollary 2.4 There is no universal element in the class of posets of cardinality 2 ! with no increasing ! 1 -sequence. Proof. Suppose P is an arbitrary element of the class. Then P is in the class but P 6 P .

Reference-contexts: This is exactly what we are going to show using the strong diamond principle. This should be compared with results of Mekler and Shelah <ref> [MS93] </ref> who proved that the statement that the class of T (A), A costationary, has an upper bound (below ! 1 ) is consistent and independent of ZFC+3. <p> The other claim is proved similarily. 2 Is it true that for every tree T with T 0 &lt; T &lt; ! 1 there is a costationary A ! 1 such that T (A) 6 T ? Not necessarily: By a result of Mekler and Shelah <ref> [MS93] </ref> the existence of a tree T such that T 0 &lt; T &lt; ! 1 and T (A) T for all costationary A ! 1 , is consistent and independent of ZF C + GCH + 3.

Reference-contexts: We give a relatively complete picture of the ordering of T below T 0 . Among trees above T 0 we find pairs of incomparable trees, which can be chosen to be Aronszajn, if CH is assumed, and Souslin, if 3 is assumed. It was proved in <ref> [MV93] </ref> that under MA+2 ! &gt; ! 1 all Aronszajn trees are comparable with each other by . In Section 6 we study the Bottleneck Problem and the Comparability Problem for trees T 2 T such that T 0 &lt; T &lt; ! 1 . <p> But then hjff extends to both S ff+1 ! T gjff _ 0 and S ff+1 ! T gjff _ 1 ; a contradiction. The case that T g S is ruled out similarly, using i = 1. 2 - 17 - Remark It was proved in <ref> [MV93] </ref> that if MA @ 1 , then T T 0 holds for every T 2 T and every Aronszajn tree T 0 . So the assumption 2 ! &lt; 2 ! 1 cannot be dropped in Theorem 5.6.

Reference-contexts: Our first method is called -operation. For a partial order P , the tree P is defined as the set of ascending sequences of elements of P , ordered by end-extension. This operation is originally due to Kurepa [Kur56] and it was later used and extended by Todorcevic <ref> [Tod85, Tod95] </ref>. In model theory it was used by Hyttinen [Hyt87]. In Section 2 we demonstrate the versatility of the -operation in providing both universal elements and counter-examples to universality in various classes of structures. <p> For some applications in topology and Banach space theory, see <ref> [Tod95] </ref>. Example 2.7 ([Tod85]). <p> Proof. T is closed and P (T ) is compact. 2 This Proposition indicates that the -operation may be used to kill universality in certain classes of compact spaces. For example, there is no universal space in the class of first countable compact Hausdorff spaces. (see <ref> [Tod95] </ref>). Todorcevic has also proved that every closed subset of T is its retract (see [Tod95, Lemma 2]). <p> For example, there is no universal space in the class of first countable compact Hausdorff spaces.
