Title: A Topological Completeness Theorem  
Author: Carsten Butz 
Date: September 10, 1996  
Abstract: We prove a topological completeness theorem for infinitary geometric theories with respect to sheaf models. The theorem extends a classical result of Makkai and Reyes, stating that any topos with enough points has an open spatial cover. We show that one can achieve in addition that the cover is connected and locally connected.

Reference-contexts: Most toposes arising in practice have enough points. We mention the toposes Sh (X) for X a topological space, BG for G a discrete or continuous group, or as a less trivial example theetale topos Sh (X et ) associated to a scheme X in algebraic geometry (see <ref> [1] </ref>). We sketch the construction of B (T) for a geometric theory T formulated in L ! . For simplicity we assume to have a one-sorted language.

Reference-contexts: If E = Sh (X), the topos of sheaves over a topological space, we speak about topological models. The category of models in the topos Sh (H) of sheaves over a (complete) Heyting algebra H is naturally equivalent to the category of H-valued models, see <ref> [5] </ref>. Models in the topos BG of G-sets (G a group) are sometimes refered to as permutation models.
