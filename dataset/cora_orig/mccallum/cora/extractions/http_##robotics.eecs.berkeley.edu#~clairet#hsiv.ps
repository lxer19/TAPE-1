Abstract: The study of hierarchical, hybrid control systems in the framework of air traffic management (ATM) is presented. The need for a new ATM arises from the overcrowding of large urban airports and the need to more efficiently handle larger numbers of aircraft, without building new runways. Recent technological advances, such as the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time computers both on board the aircraft and in the control tower, make a more advanced air traffic control system possible. The benefits from these technological advances are limited by today's Air Traffic Control (ATC), a ground-based system which routes aircraft along predefined jet ways in the sky, allowing the aircraft very little autonomy in choosing their own routes. In this paper we propose a decentralized ATM framework, meaning that much of the current ATC functionality is moved on board each aircraft. Within this framework, we describe our work in on-board conflict resolution strategies between aircraft, and in deriving the flight mode switching logic in the flight vehicle management systems of each aircraft.

Reference-contexts: This procedure is referred to as free flight. A summary of the efficiency issues of the current ATM and a description of ATM technologies that will become available in the near future is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to improve efficiency, researchers at NASA Ames are developing a system which automates some parts of ATC. The system is called the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), and is described in [2]. <p> Although the conflict may be resolved using the general maneuver discussed above, the issue of fairness arises.

If v 1 v 2 , it is not clear how to choose which aircraft deviates from its original trajectory. <p> We would like to calculate the "steady state" safe set, or the safe set of states for all t 2 <ref> [1; 0] </ref>. We construct the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for this system and attempt to calculate its steady state solution. Define the Hamiltonian H (x; p; u ()) = p T f (x; u ()) where p 2 T fl R 2 is the costate. <p> We describe the construction of the safe set starting from the left boundary fx 2 Sjl 1 (x) = 0g. The inward pointing normal to l 1 (x) = 0 is p = <ref> [1; 0] </ref> T , so that along this boundary, u fl 1 = T max but u 2 is indeterminate. Because of the loss of dependency on u 2 of the optimal Hamiltonian, the points in fx 2 Sjl 1 (x) = 0g are called abnormal extremals.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the maneuvers and resulting commands are accessed from a database of precomputed solutions to possible conflicts. Examples of conflict resolution maneuvers are presented in the next section, and in more detail in <ref> [3] </ref>. When the tactical planner predicts that a conflict will occur, it sends a discrete signal to the strategic planner. After conflict resolution, a new tactical plan needs to be established and new conflicts predicted. Verification is needed to guarantee that this process eventually leads to an acceptable, conflict-free trajectory. <p> In this section, we describe an algorithm for resolving possible collision conflicts between aircraft. This algorithm is presented in greater depth in <ref> [3] </ref>. Research in the area of conflict detection and resolution for air traffic has been centered on predicting conflict and deriving maneuvers assuming that the intent of each aircraft is known to all other aircraft involved in the conflict, for both deterministic [8], [9] and probabilistic [10],[11] models. <p> Its optimal value is obtained by minimizing with respect to the length of ABC divided by the speed of the aircraft along this path. As the ratio v 2 =v 1 gets large, the optimal value for approaches 45 ffi <ref> [3] </ref>. This Overtake maneuver is a special case of the general class of triangular conflict resolution maneuvers.

Reference-contexts: A derivation of the flight mode logic necessary for safe operation of a CTOL (Conventional Take Off and Landing) aircraft is presented in Section 5, and in more detail, in <ref> [4] </ref>. The resulting trajectory, denoted y d , x d , and u d in Figure 2, is given to the regulation layer which directly controls the aircraft. The task of the trajectory planner is complicated by the presence of non-minimum phase dynamics [5], [6] and actuator saturation [7]. <p> Clearly verification is needed to show that the scheme eventually converges to an acceptable trajectory. Due to the increased complexity of the models it is unlikely that timed automata techniques will be adequate in this setting. More elaborate (possibly hybrid) techniques, such as those in <ref> [4] </ref> may be useful here. 4 Conflict Resolution The operation of the proposed ATM involves the interaction of continuous and discrete dynamics. Such hybrid phenomena arise, for example, from the coordination between aircraft at the strategic level. The conflict resolution maneuvers are implemented in the form of discrete communication protocols. <p> A potential conflict exists regardless of the speeds of aircraft 2 and aircraft 1. Although the conflict may be resolved using the general maneuver discussed above, the issue of fairness arises. Fig. 7. Unsafe sets (x r (0); y r (0)) for [v 1 ; v 1 ] = <ref> [2; 4] </ref>, [v 2 ; v 2 ] = [1; 5] and r = =2, =4, 0, and =2. If v 1 v 2 , it is not clear how to choose which aircraft deviates from its original trajectory. <p> This example was originally presented as part of a research program to develop models of hybrid systems [16], <ref> [4] </ref>. In the example, the goal of the FVMS is to keep the state of the aircraft in a given subset of the state space dictated in principle by stall constraints. The task is complicated by input saturation which also dictates the flight mode switching. <p> of the safe set of states V 1 is given by @V 1 = f (V; fl)j (V = V min ) ^ (fl min fl fl a ) _ 1 _ (V = V max ) ^ (fl b fl fl max ) _ 1 _ (21) Proof: See <ref> [4] </ref>. The safe set of control inputs U 1 can be characterized as a set-valued feedback map U 1 : S ! 2 U , in which U 1 (x) is the subset of U which guarantees that the requirement on J 1 is satisfied at x.

Reference-contexts: Pairwise conflict resolution may not work in cases such as these: it is worthwhile to design a maneuver which works for three aircraft, with the possibility to extend it to more than three aircraft. A maneuver which is inspired by the potential field algorithms of the robotics literature <ref> [15] </ref> is the Roundabout maneuver, illustrated in Figure 10 for the case of three aircraft with two initial points of conflict. For this maneuver, Fig. 10. Conflict Resolution for three aircraft: the Roundabout maneuver a circular path is defined around the conflict points of all three trajectories as shown.

The example is based on the dynamic aircraft equations and the design specification of <ref> [17] </ref>. The equations model the speed and the flight path angle dynamics of a commercial aircraft in still air. The control inputs to the equations are the thrust T, accessed through the engine throttle, and the pitch angle , accessed through the elevators. <p> Safety regulations for the aircraft dictate that V and fl must remain within specified limits: for ease of presentation we simplify this safety envelope, S, of <ref> [17] </ref> to where V min ; V max ; fl min ; fl max are constant values. The specification is to design a control scheme, an FVMS, which will cause the aircraft to reach a target operating point (V; fl) target in S from any initial operating point in S.
