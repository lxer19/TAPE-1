Abstract: B-splines are one of many spline formulations for representing smooth curves. These formulations are found in a variety of applications, including interactive curve design. Previous research has shown that the B-spline is an effective formulation for this setting. However, a possible drawback for the novice user in using the B-spline is the fact that its control vertices may lie far away from the curve, making its manipulation un-intuitive. This problem is compounded in three dimensions. A direct manipulation technique, allowing a curve to be manipulated with points that lie on the curve itself, offers an alternative to control vertex manipulation. An experiment was conducted to compare the interactive design of 3D curves using control vertex manipulation of B-spline curves and a particular type of direct manipulation of B-spline curves. The results of the experiment revealed that direct manipulation was significantly faster than control vertex manipulation, without sacrificing accuracy in the shape of the final 3D curve. A general testbed designed for this investigation and related studies of 3D interaction techniques was used to conduct the experiment. La B-spline est une des nombreuses formulations de spline pour representer des courbes. Ces formulations se retrouvent dans une varite d'applications, inclu-ant le design interactif de courbe. Certains resultats ont demontre que la B-spline est une formulation effi-cace pour cet emploi. Cependant, un probleme pour un usager novice reside dans le fait que les points de controle peuvent etre tres eloignes de la courbe, ren dant sa manipulation peu intuitive. Ce probleme est accru en trois dimensions. Une technique de manipulation directe, permettant de manipuler la courbe avec des points residant sur la courbe elle-m^eme, offre une alternative a la manipulation des points de controle. Une experience fut conduite pour comparer le design interactif de courbes en 3D. Elle compare entre la manipulation des points de controle et un type particulier de manipulation directe. Les resultats de l'experience ont demontre que la manipulation directe est plus rapide que la manipulation des points de controle, sans pour autant sacrifier la precision dans la forme finale de la courbe. Pour realiser l'experience, un testbed general fut con~cu a partir d'etudes reliees aux techniques interactives. fl Department of Psychology, UBC

Reference-contexts: More recently, the term direct manipulation has been used to describe the technique of manipulating a spline curve by picking any point on the curve, dragging it to a new location, and having the curve pass through the new point <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paper, direct manipulation refers to a similar technique where a finite number of points on the curve are chosen for manipulation. The points on the curve which have been chosen for the direct manipulation points are the joints of the curve. <p> A similar direct manipulation formulation for surfaces was introduced by Forsey [8]. For background information on splines, refer to an introductory text on 2 splines [1]. For further details on direct manipulation of B-splines, refer to Bartels and Beatty's conference paper on direct manipulation <ref> [2] </ref> or Jang's Masters thesis [9]. 2. AN EXPERIMENT TO COMPARE DIRECT MANIPULATION WITH CONTROLLED VERTEX MANIPULATION A curve-matching experiment comparing the effectiveness of direct manipulation of 3D B-spline curves with that of control vertex manipulation was conducted to test the hypothesis that direct manipulation is superior for 3D curves.

Reference-contexts: The use of a shape-matching task as a standin for a shape-creation task is termed the shape-matching paradigm. It is described in a series of papers that discuss various applications of the shape-matching paradigm for the study of 2D curve manipulation techniques <ref> [4, 5 and 10] </ref>. The experiment presented here is an extension of the work performed at Waterloo using the shape-matching paradigm. This study deals with 3D spline curves. Two techniques were investigated for 3D B-spline manipulation.

Reference-contexts: In this experiment, subjects would perform the task given varying amounts of rotation. As an initial prediction, the amount of rotation allowed should correlate positively with the accuracy in depth. Deering has investigated similar tasks and found that a head-tracked display provides very good depth cues <ref> [6] </ref>. * Using a Spaceball or other 6-D input device to change the orientation of curves and/or manipulation of control points [12]. As with the head tracker, the mouse is freed of the task of changing views. Instead, the subject would use his left hand to control the Spaceball.

Reference-contexts: The majority of the analysis looked at the time and error data from the experiment. Two types of analysis were used, the t-test and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Literature on these tools can be found in any introductory statistics text <ref> [7] </ref>. An ff value of 0.05 or lower was used to decide if a result was significant. When reporting significant results using the t-test, the two means will be given followed by their respective standard deviations in parentheses.

Reference-contexts: This source code is a re-working of Ruest's experiment software <ref> [10] </ref>. The modification of his software to work with 3D curves was fairly easy because the Silicon Graphics library routines (GL) work in a 3D world by default. However, the revision of the user interface to handle 3D curve-matching generated many questions to which there were many possible answers.

Reference-contexts: Direct manipulation is a term coined by Shneiderman <ref> [11] </ref> almost a decade ago. He used it to describe computer interfaces that were easy to learn and master, were intuitive for the novice and experienced computer user, and were enjoyable to use.
