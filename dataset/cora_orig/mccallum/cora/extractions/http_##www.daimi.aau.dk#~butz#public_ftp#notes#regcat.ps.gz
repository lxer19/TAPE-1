Title: Regular Categories and Coherent Logic  
Author: Carsten Butz

Abstract: 1 Notes handed out to students attending the course on Category Theory at the Computer Science Department in Aarhus, Spring 1998. These notes were supposed to give more detailed information about the relationship between regular categories and coherent logic than is contained in Jaap van Oosten's script on category theory (BRICS Lectures Series LS-95-1).
