Abstract: A simple analytical exercise has been performed to calculate the effects which pixel angular size has on the determination of the shower detector plane and consequently on the abiltiy to measure the depth of shower maximum. A table is presented which lists the maximum pixel size required to obtain an uncertainty of less than 15 gm=cm 2 in shower maximum. This is done for various zenith angles and for three possible shower detector plane fitting schemes. The accuracy with which a fluorescence detector can measure a shower's depth of maximum development (X max ) depends on two nearly separate capabilities. The first is the ability to adequately determine the shower development shape in the presence of a significant background. The second is the ability to adequately determine the plane which contains the shower axis and the fluorescence detector itself. Using the methods outlined by Paul Sommers in the original design report it is found that the optimum pixel size based on minimizing cost and maximizing the deterimination of shower shape is so large that for short shower tracks (&lt; 10 ffi ) the detector can only find the shower detector plane (SDP) to a few degrees. The SDP is found from the pattern of hit pixels and their projection on the celestial sphere. The ability to adequaty determine the SDP is clearly related to the angular size of the pixels and the number hit. Uncertainty in the SDP means uncertainty in the zenith angle of the shower and a consequent uncertainty in the depth scale since the slant depth assigned to a given point along the shower goes as
