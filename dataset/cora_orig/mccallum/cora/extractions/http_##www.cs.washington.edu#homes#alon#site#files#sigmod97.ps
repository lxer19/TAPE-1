Reference-contexts: Finally, the HTML generator materializes a site graph as a browsable graph of HTML pages. Data integration. Defining the data graph requires integrating information from multiple sources. Our approach to data integration is similar in spirit to those developed in systems such as TSIMMIS [CGMH + 94], HERMES <ref> [ACPS96] </ref>, DISCO [TRV97] and Information Manifold [LRO96], SIMS [AKS96] and Occam [KW96], in the sense that strudel defines a virtual loose schema and mappings between the contents of the data sources and the virtual schema. Our approach to object fusion is inspired by TSIMMIS [PAGM96].

Reference-contexts: In addition, the selection component of the language supports regular path expressions, which specify how to match paths of arbitrary length in a data graph. Our language benefits from previous work in the area of querying unstructured data, graph data, and data with unknown schema <ref> [Woo88, BDHS96, MMM96, AQM + 96, CCM96] </ref>. The following example strudel query produces a site graph that contains HomePage nodes derived from objects in the Manager and Person collections in the data graph. The FROM clause specifies the collections from which the site graph will be created.

Reference-contexts: When a Web site is constructed as a result of a query, one could build additional structures for de scribing the Web site (e.g., MCF <ref> [Guh97, BDFS97] </ref>). Such structures can be exploited by sophisticated search engines or for building a site-specific search engine. 7. Because strudel uses a graph data model, existing Web sites can be incorporated directly in the strudel system.

Reference-contexts: In every level of the strudel system, data is viewed uniformly as a graph. At the bottom-most level, data is stored in strudel's own graph data repository or in external sources (see Figure 1), which are viewed as graphs. strudel's graph model is very similar to that of OEM <ref> [CGMH + 94] </ref>; graphs contain objects, or named nodes, connected by edges labeled with attribute names. strudel also provides collections, which are named sets of objects. <p> Finally, the HTML generator materializes a site graph as a browsable graph of HTML pages.

Reference-contexts: The task of building and managing Web sites presents a unique opportunity for applying concepts from database management systems, such as the separation between the logical view of information and its storage and maintenance and the ability to restructure information via queries. Furthermore, recent research results on information integration <ref> [Ull97] </ref> and managing semi-structured data [ACM97, Abi97] can play a key role in managing Web sites. The goal of strudel project is to extend and adapt these concepts to the problem of Web-site management. Consider several tasks required of a Web-site manager.
