Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is as much a matter of strategy as of selecting specific statistical operations. We have developed a knowledge-based planning system, called Aide, to help users with EDA. Aide strikes a balance between conventional statistical packages, which need guidance for every step in the exploration, and autonomous systems, which leave the user entirely out of the decision-making process. Aide's processing is based on artificial intelligence planning techniques, which give us a useful means of representing some types of statistical strategy. In this article we describe the design of Aide and its behavior in exploring a small, complex dataset.

Reference-contexts: The importance of a navigation facility is reflected by research in mixed-initiative planning. James Allen has drawn a useful analogy between mixed-initiative planning and dialog between problem-solving agents <ref> [1] </ref>. Allen identifies three distinguishing characteristics of the approach: flexible, opportunistic control of initiative; the ability to change focus of attention; mechanisms for maintaining shared, implicit knowledge. <p> Mixed-initiative systems have recently become interesting to researchers in AI planning. An extension of prodigy, for example, provides autonomous planning with consultation [23], by letting the user review each decision the planner makes. Allen's work in the trains project provides a more formal basis for mixed-initiative interaction <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Modern statistical packages provide sophisticated interfaces to support EDA (in fact, the more sophisticated systems contain far more functionality than we can include in Aide, which is as much a tool for AI research as for statistical analysis.) Statistical environments like LispStat [24] and S <ref> [2] </ref>, for example, contain procedures for regression analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis, ANOVA, and dozens of other techniques. Systems targeted at specific approaches, such as grand tour or projection pur 16 suit, provide a great deal of interactive support for their designated tasks.

Reference-contexts: Traditional AI planners construct plans from primitive actions, starting from scratch for each new problem. Script-based planning takes a different approach <ref> [8, 3] </ref>. If a planning system repeatedly encounters similar problems, it becomes wasteful to generate similar solutions from scratch each time. Instead, a script-based planner can rely on a library of plans that apply to common cases. <p> Each branch point, i.e., each node with more than one child, is a focus point. The meta-planner uses this branching tree to implement a form of opportunistic backtracking, which is sometimes called "refocusing" <ref> [3] </ref>. Whenever a focus point is visited (or revisited, on plan completion) the meta-planner is invoked. The meta-planner is identical in design to the planner that executes the base-level plans described earlier.

Reference-contexts: In the next sections we discuss the actions that constitute basic plan primitives, the representation of Aide plans, and the control of their execution. 3.1 Primitive operations in Aide Following suggestions in the literature (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>), we represent datasets as relations. Variables correspond to relation attributes, while observations correspond to relation tuples. Bivariate and multivariate relationships are relations with two or more attributes. A variable may be considered either an attribute of a relation or a relation consisting of a single attribute.

Reference-contexts: We build our description of Aide around an example taken from an experiment with phoenix, a simulation of forest fires and fire-fighting agents in Yellowstone National Park <ref> [5] </ref>. We first describe the experiment and our exploration of the data, originally carried out by hand, and then discuss the role an automated assistant could play in the process.

In modern computer-based statistics packages we find a rich set of operations, suitable for almost any EDA application.

Reference-contexts: accepts the suggestion of a linear fit, and Aide pursues a linear fitting strategy which involves autonomous decisions about how to fit the line and how to examine the residuals (Residual examination is part of a larger set of plans, based on a regression strategy developed by Gale and Pregibon <ref> [7] </ref>.) Other examples of autonomous behavior on Aide's part include searching for predictive relationships involving categorical variables when clusters are explored, generating a linear fit for a relationship if it has been transformed to remove curvature, "sharpening" a relationship if no clear pattern is initially apparent [26], and performing various other <p> The study of statistical strategies, or formal descriptions of the actions and decisions involved in applying statistical tools to a problem [10], has led to automated systems in several areas. For example, Gale and Pregibon's rex implemented a strategy for linear regression <ref> [7] </ref>. rex was one of the earliest attempts to apply AI techniques to the representation of statistical expertise. In another research area, Oldford and Peters developed a complex automated strategy for collinearity analysis [17].

Reference-contexts: An automated system will inevitably make mistakes from time to time, so its reasoning process (past decisions as well as current ones) must be available to the user for approval or modification. A responsiveness to the guidance provided by human knowledge of context has been termed "accommodation" <ref> [15] </ref>. An accommodating system takes advantage of human knowledge to augment its own necessarily limited view of the world. <p> In another research area, Oldford and Peters developed a complex automated strategy for collinearity analysis [17]. With the system tess, Lubinsky and Pregibon studied the accommodation of human knowledge in data analysis <ref> [15] </ref>; rather than automating data analysis, tess is modeled after systems that perform tasks like interactive regression, in which human knowledge of the meaning of the data is used incrementally to build a model.

Reference-contexts: We begin by observing that the relationship can be partitioned into two parts: a vertical partition at zero on the Effort axis and a separate, approximately linear partition. We call the gap in the distribution of Effort an indication, a suggestive characteristic of the data <ref> [16] </ref>. Examining other variables we find that the vertical partition corresponds to trials in which the outcome was Failure. Turning to the Success partition, we note that the correlation is positive, as expected.

Reference-contexts: Planners rely on task decomposition to solve complex problems, using knowledge about states, actions, and goals to structure the search at different levels of abstraction <ref> [19] </ref>. The simplest planners work by backward-chaining. Given a goal state, a planner begins by examining those actions that achieve the goal state.

Reference-contexts: We define three types of operations: reduction, transformation, and decomposition. These operations are higher-order functions that take functions and relations as input. They constitute a language for manipulating exploratory structures, in the same sense that the relational algebra constitutes a language for manipulation of relations in a database <ref> [22] </ref>. 6 A reduction operation maps a relation to an atomic element. A reduction takes a function and a relation as input. Computing the mean of a sequence of numbers is an example of a reduction of a relation whose single attribute has a numeric domain.

These strategic considerations guide our application of specific techniques for fitting lines, examining residuals, and so forth.

In some areas Aide behaves much like a conventional statistical system but in other areas provides more autonomous assistance. Maintaining this balance is harder than might appear at first glance.
