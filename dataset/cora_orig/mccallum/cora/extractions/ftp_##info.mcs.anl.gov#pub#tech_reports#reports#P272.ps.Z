Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One approach for the validated solution of initial value problems for ODEs is built upon a Taylor series method. Moore [20, 21], Rall [22], Adams <ref> [1] </ref>, Lohner [17], and Eijgenraam [14] were the first to use Taylor series methods to enclose the solutions of ODEs. One of the main advantages of using a Taylor series method is the simple representation of the local discretization error. <p> We represent an interval-valued solution at t i as [y i ] = ~y i + [e i ]. The implicit Euler method becomes e n+1 hf y (~y n+1 + <ref> [0; 1] </ref> e n+1 ) e n+1 = e n 2 for e n 2 [e n ], and y contained in an a-priori inclusion Y n+1 ; the approximate solution ~y n+1 at t n+1 is chosen such that ~y n+1 = ~y n + hf (~y n+1 ).

Reference-contexts: This is a report on work in progress. Some numerical experiments have been done, but much more experimental and theoretical work remains to be done. Another manuscript <ref> [7] </ref> is in preparation describing in detail the relationship of the implicit Taylor series methods described here to implicit methods based on Pade approximations. 2 Stiffness In this paper, we present initial steps towards algorithms for solving stiff systems of ODEs based on Taylor series. <p> Remark: The IoeTSM with k = m = 1 and oe = 1 2 is the well-known implicit trapezoidal rule, which is A-stable, but not B-stable. 8 In a forthcoming paper <ref> [7] </ref>, a class of high-order stiff ordinary differential equations solvers based on Pade approximations is introduced and analyzed. In this approach, the advantages of Taylor series methods mentioned above are maintained and combined with highest possible order of the local truncation error.

Reference-contexts: In order to retain the stability of the true solution in the computed solution, the step must be very small. It is not possible to use a step size that is adjusted to the smoothness of the solution sought. That is why authors as early as 1928 <ref> [8] </ref> or 1947 [9] were led to consider implicit methods in which the approximate solution y i+1 at t = t i+1 is given by the solution to some nonlinear system. Many implicit methods allow step sizes appropriate to the smoothness of the solution.

Reference-contexts: Many implicit methods allow step sizes appropriate to the smoothness of the solution. Historically, the first theoretical concept especially suited for the assessment of numerical methods for stiff problems was A-stability <ref> [11] </ref>. A-stability means that computed numerical approximations to decreasing components are also decreasing. This analysis is based on the model linear constant coefficient problem y 0 = Ay. The concept of B-stability [15] is the basis for a general convergence theory for nonlinear stiff problems.

For degree k = 1, the resulting method is the implicit Euler method, whose stability and convergence properties are well known.

Reference-contexts: This would cause a severe and unrealistic step-size restriction whenever the Picard-Lindelof existence theorem is applied to get an a-priori inclusion. Subtle algorithms have to be developed. During the preparation of this manuscript, we received Kreuser's diploma thesis <ref> [16] </ref>, which presents an alternative approach to computing inclusions of solutions for stiff ODEs. Kreuser's approach transforms the original stiff system (2.2) into the new system y 0 = Ay + (f (y) Ay); where A is a local approximation of the Jacobian f y (y).

The stability function R (z) corresponding to this method is a (0; k)Pade approximation to the exponential exp (z) [12], where k is the degree of the Taylor series. <p> The a-priori inclusion is obtained by symbolic computation of the matrix exponential function, 9 thus avoiding the severe step-size restriction inherent in Lohner's explicit ap-proach <ref> [17] </ref>. To get an inclusion [y i ] = ~y i + [e i ] for the solution at t i , the approximate solution ~y i is obtained by integrating the linear ODE and applying a Taylor series method to the nonlinear part.

Reference-contexts: Schneid [24] showed that the Lobatto 6 4, 5, 6 IIIC method for s = 2 is not only A-stable, but also B-convergent of order 2 under some reasonable step-size restrictions. The corresponding stability regions for the (0; k)Pade approximation (see <ref> [23] </ref> give stability regions for certain Runge-Kutta methods that are qualitatively similar to Figure 2. 4 Implicit oe Taylor Series Methods (IoeTSM) The lack of A-stability of the simple ITSM for higher orders suggests that we try to increase the degree of the numerator in the corresponding rational stability function.
