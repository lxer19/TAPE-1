Abstract: The efficiency of a parallel implementation of the conjugate gradient method preconditioned by an incomplete Cholesky factorization can vary dramatically depending on the column ordering chosen. One method to minimize the number of major parallel steps is to choose an ordering based on a coloring of the symmetric graph representing the nonzero adjacency structure of the matrix. In this paper, we compare the performance of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method using these coloring orderings with a number of standard orderings on matrices arising from applications in structural engineering. Because optimal colorings for these systems may not be a priori known, we employ several graph coloring heuristics to obtain consistent colorings. Based on lower bounds obtained from the local structure of these systems, we find that the colorings determined by these heuristics are nearly optimal. For these problems, we find that the increase in parallelism afforded by the coloring-based orderings more than offsets any increase in the number of iterations required for the convergence of the conjugate gradient algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of this observation is that it usually straightforward to determine the maximum sized r-element in the finite element model. It is known that an optimal coloring can be obtained via a greedy heuristic if the vertices are visited in the correct order <ref> [1] </ref>. The basic structure of the greedy heuristic is shown below. Greedy Heuristic. Compute a vertex ordering fv 1 ; : : : ; v n g for V . <p> It is well known that the maximum degree of graph determines an upper bound for the chromatic number <ref> [1] </ref>. Let (G) = max v2V deg (v), where deg (v) is the degree of vertex v in G. The upper bound is given by O (G) (G) + 1. Note that the greedy heuristics will always satisfy this bound.

Reference-contexts: We have used two vertex ordering strategies. The first of these heuristics is the smallest-last ordering (SLO) suggested by Mat-ula, Marble, and Isaacson [13].

These vertex orderings are defined as follows. Suppose that vertices v i+1 ; : : : ; v n have been chosen.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method [10] is one of the most successful iterative methods for solving large, sparse, symmetric, positive-definite linear systems. A preconditioner that has been shown to be very effective over a wide variety of problems is the incomplete Cholesky factorization [12]. Recently, several authors <ref> [4, 5, 15, 17] </ref> have examined the effect of matrix orderings based on multicolorings on the convergence properties of iterative methods. However, this work has considered only problems generated from regular grids, for which an optimal coloring is a priori known.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider sparse linear systems that arise from applications in structural engineering as well as the standard grid problems. For many of these problems, optimal multicolorings are not known. In general, the determination of an optimal coloring is an NP-hard problem <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus, we have explored the use of graph coloring heuristics to obtain the desired orderings. Our experimental results show that the combination of incomplete factorization and coloring heuristics results in a parallel preconditioner that is applicable to symmetric, positive-definite matrices arising in practical applications. <p> The minimum possible value for s is known as the chromatic number of G (A), which we denote as O (G). The question as to whether a general graph G (A) is s-colorable is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. It is known that unless P = N P , there does not exist a polynomial approximation scheme for solving the graph coloring problem [6]. <p> The question as to whether a general graph G (A) is s-colorable is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. It is known that unless P = N P , there does not exist a polynomial approximation scheme for solving the graph coloring problem [6]. In fact, the best polynomial time heuristic known [11] can theoretically guarantee a coloring of only size c (n= log n) O (G), where c is some constant. It is therefore rather surprising that a coloring heuristic should perform well at all in practice.

Reference-contexts: In the second set of experiments, the performance of the coloring heuristics is compared with three other ordering algorithms: minimum degree, reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM), and nested dissection. A good description of these other algorithms can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. In Appendix A, figures showing the orderings produced by the various heuristics for the PANEL problem are given. Points of interest are the number of iterations needed to solve the linear systems and the depth of the dependency graph for incomplete factorization and forward/backward substitution.

Reference-contexts: A significant pitfall for the straightforward incomplete factorization algorithm is that it may fail to produce a positive-definite factorization, even though the matrix is positive definite. Because positive definiteness is required for the conjugate gradient method <ref> [8] </ref>, some mechanism must be included to deal with the detection of indefiniteness during the incomplete factorization process. For the results presented in this paper, we have used the technique of adding an increasing multiple of the diagonal until the matrix can be successfully factored.

Reference-contexts: For the sake of comparison, matrices arising from the five-point and nine-point finite-difference discretizations on a 30 fi 30 grid were included in the test suite. It is well known that matrices arising from these stencils can be colored using two and four colors, respectively. The CLAM package <ref> [9] </ref> was the environment used to run the experiments. In Table 1, the complete suite of test problems is described. 1 The diagonal of each matrix was scaled to be the identity matrix.
