Abstract: We discuss a robotic module called a Molecule. Molecules can be the basis for building self-reconfiguring robots. They support multiple modalities of locomotion and manipulation. We describe the design, functionality, and control of the Molecule. We show how a set of Molecules can aggregate as active three-dimensional structures that can move and change shape. We show an efficient algorithm for planning the trajectory of Molecules for self-reconfiguration. Finally, we discuss our Molecule experiments.

Reference-contexts: One degree of freedom allows rotation about one connector. The second degree-of-freedom allows rotation of the atom about the bond. Detailed descriptions of the design and control of the Molecule can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. A set of such Molecules can self-aggregate as arbitrary three-dimensional structures. We show this result by demonstrating several different tilings of the plane with the Molecule. The tilings can be stacked so that the resulting structures are three-dimensional. <p> Our self-reconfigurable robots <ref> [8, 7] </ref> are different from metamorphic robots in their design and functionality.

Reference-contexts: In this section we focus on the Molecule motion control for moving an individual Molecule on a substrate of other Molecules. In Section 6 we give a geometric approach to planning Molecule trajectories on a substrate of other Molecules. In <ref> [9, 11] </ref> we present other planning bounds and algorithms for controlling the global motion of a structure made of Molecules. Molecule motion is controlled by attaching an atom to some other Molecule and actuating one or more of the four degrees of freedom of the Molecule. <p> The bond is green. The checkered surface represents a lattice of Molecule connectors. tem, individual motion management becomes impossible. For example, over 15 individual rotations are currently used to implement one primitive in the global (planar) walk of a two module or four module structure <ref> [9] </ref>. In this section we show a geometric formulation of Molecule motions that reduces the trajectory planning problem for individual Molecules to graph search. 6.1 A Graph Model Suppose S is a connected molecular structure composed of k Molecules arranged as an arbitrary three-dimensional structure.
