Reference-contexts: Thus EQN knows relatively little about mathematics. In particular, mathematical symbols like +, -, , parentheses, and so on have no special meanings. EQN is quite happy to set garbage (but it will look good). EQN works as a preprocessor for the typesetter formatter, TROFF <ref> [1] </ref>, so the normal mode of operation is to prepare a document with both mathematics and ordinary text interspersed, and let EQN set the mathematics while TROFF does the body of the text. On UNIX, EQN will also produce mathematics on DASI and GSI terminals and on Model 37 teletypes.

Reference-contexts: To use a GSI or DASI terminal as the output device, neqn files nroff -Tx where x is the terminal type you are using, such as 300 or 300S. EQN and NEQN can be used with the TBL program <ref> [2] </ref> for setting tables that contain mathematics. Use TBL before [N]EQN, like this: tbl files eqn troff tbl files neqn nroff 26. Acknowledgments We are deeply indebted to J. F.

Reference-contexts: This means that you have to take care of things like centering, numbering, and so on yourself. The most common way is to use the TROFF and NROFF macro package package `-ms' developed by M. E. Lesk <ref> [3] </ref>, which allows you to center, indent, left-justify and number equations. With the `-ms' package, equations are centered by default. To left-justify an equation, use .EQ L instead of .EQ. To indent it, use .EQ I.
