Reference-contexts: We refer the reader to [12] for an elegant analysis of Algorithm PAIR and the proof of the following theorem. Theorem 4 [12] Whp PAIR ends successfully with m = jA ? j = jB ? j :49n. It is well known, see for example <ref> [2] </ref>, that whp both H 1 and H 2 consist of forests plus a small number, O (log n) say, vertices on unicyclic components. 2.2 Properties of the output of Algorithm PAIR We regard D 2in;2out as D 2in fi D 2out . <p> Certainly m is no less than the number of isolated trees in IG. So (see <ref> [2] </ref> or [5]) whp m (1 o (1)) 2 k=1 k! 2 k Given m, H 2 is independent of IG.

So (see [2] or <ref> [5] </ref>) whp m (1 o (1)) 2 k=1 k! 2 k Given m, H 2 is independent of IG. <p> Proof We know from Theorem 4 that whp H 2 will be composed of ffn, ff :49, random edges.

We can argue by symmetry (as in [8]) that we can take to be a random permutation. It is well known (e.g. Feller <ref> [6] </ref>), that whp a random permutation contains at most 2log n cycles, and thus the permutation digraph has size at most 2log n. 2 As we use some edges of D 2 in Phases 2 and 3, we will need to understand the distribution of the edges not contained in 1

Reference-contexts: This has been the object of considerable study, and the main outstanding question, is how large should k be for G kout to have a Hamilton cycle whp. It was previously known that k 5 is sufficient, (Frieze and Luczak <ref> [8] </ref>), and it is conjectured that the correct lower bound for k is 3. By ignoring orientation in Theorem 1 we obtain an improvement on [8]: Corollary 2 G 4out is Hamiltonian whp: From now on we use D 2 to denote D 2in;2out . <p> It was previously known that k 5 is sufficient, (Frieze and Luczak <ref> [8] </ref>), and it is conjectured that the correct lower bound for k is 3.

Furthermore the deleted edges X are randomly chosen. Following the argument of [12], if we had randomly deleted 50.5% of the edges of G n;n we would have G n;:495n and then whp (i) ended up with a graph satisfying 1-4 above, (ii) deleted fewer than 51% of the edges <p> During PAIR at least 51% of the edges of the giant component of H 1 are deleted whp, see <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Subsequent phases of our algorithm will require us to expose some of the sets out (v); in (v), v 2 V . These exposures will fix some entries of t and . We follow the method of deferred decisions <ref> [13] </ref>, and generate the necessary parts of ; t as we go. For example, if we wish to determine out (v) = fu 1 ; u 2 g on the digraph D 2 , we will determine out A (v) on BIP (D 2 ).
