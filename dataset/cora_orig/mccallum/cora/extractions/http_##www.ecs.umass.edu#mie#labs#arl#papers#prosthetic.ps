Title: 3-D Model Acquisition, Design, Planning and Manufacturing of Orthopaedic Devices: A Framework

Abstract: Design and manufacture of orthopaedic devices using rapid prototyping technologies has been until recently a highly iterative process that involves multiple users, including doctors, design engineers and rapid prototyping experts. Existing systems for creation of orthopaedic parts through rapid prototyping do not follow the principles of concurrent engineering and design for manufacture. This leads to excessive commnunication between parties and delays in product realization time. In this paper, we lay out the framework for a unified expert system that will enable a doctor to quickly and easily create fully functional prosthetics and orthopaedic implants. Necessary components of the model acquisition process should include volumetric segmentation of objects from a CT or MRI dataset and NURBS surface fitting to the boundary points. Finite element analysis and surface model modification modules are also needed, but should be provided in an intuitive fashion for doctors who are not experienced in computer aided design. Pre-processing for rapid prototype building should be automatic, and should include optimal orientation, support structure generation and build simulation modules. Finally, the model should be passed to the rapid prototyping machine in a pre-sliced format for speed and accuracy.

Reference-contexts: One such system is SHASTRA <ref> [Bajaj] </ref>. Shastra utilizes a distributed design capability through the use of several toolkits to allow for the custom free-form interactive design of artificial implants (prostheses) which accurately fit the recipient's structure for both form and functionality.

Reference-contexts: The control net is formed by a set of 3-D points in space that are typically arranged in a topologically rectangular array. Barsky et al. <ref> [Barsky] </ref> presented an efficient algorithm used to compute the 3-D control points using the measured points of the surface as input to a set of simultaneous equations. The equations are solved to obtain the points that form the control net, P i;j .

Reference-contexts: However, when dealing with rapid prototyping, the model in most cases must be manipulated before the build process begins. A model that is not based on parameterized surfaces would be difficult to manipulate. Bro-Neilson <ref> [BroN] </ref> developed deformable models he calls active cubes.

Reference-contexts: Slicing a NURBS model, however, is a much more difficult problem. The methods that exist for solving this problem can be classified into four main categories: algebraic, lattice evaluation, marching and recursive subdivision. [Jun] The CLI <ref> [CLI] </ref>, or Common Layer Interface, is a recently proposed universal format for the input of geometry data to rapid prototyping machines that uses vectorized contour information instead of the more common tessellated input. It is suitable for model fabrication systems that use layer manufacturing technologies (LMT).

Reference-contexts: By automating design of support structures, the engineer no longer needs an in-depth knowledge of the manufacturing process and the support requirements when using stereolithography. <ref> [Kirsch] </ref> Knowledge regarding support structure design and inclusion into model files typ 21 ically requires very good process knowledge and experience. Currently, the design of support structures is a task that the designer performs based on past knowledge without any guides or defined rules.

Reference-contexts: However, this level of interaction is not sufficient for the doctor who would like to have more control over the prosthesis design process. More advanced systems, such as Surgicad Template <ref> [Mech1] </ref>, allow the user to create a computer model of a bone or an organ based on CT, MRI or ultrasound data. The user can then modify the image, but not the model, by defining different tissue densities for display, allowing him or her to selectively view different tissues.

Reference-contexts: Whereas this method has several advantages when applied to the field of virtual surgery, where elastic modeling of human tissue is necessary, the extra computational expense is not necessary when dealing with a model to be used for rapid prototyping. Miller <ref> [Miller] </ref> introduced a technique known as Geometrically Deformed Models (GDM's), which starts with a simple model that is already topologically closed, and deforms the model based on a set of constraints, similar to energy functions. <p> Based on the Geometrically Deformed Models (GDM's) of <ref> [Miller] </ref>, this algorithm employs local geometric dislocations and local resampling of vertices of a polyhedra to most closely approximate the surface of the anatomical object in the image. These dislocations are based on an energy functional that is 12 composed of three distinct parts.

Reference-contexts: Volumetric segmentation methods extract voxel elements from the composite 3-D image to create either a surface or solid representation of 6 the model. Many methods of volumetric segmentation have been proposed in the literature: 3.2.1 Edge Detection Monga et al. <ref> [Monga] </ref> developed an algorithm for three-dimensional edge detection consisting of two steps. The first finds points in the image that correspond to the boundaries of the surfaces forming the 3-D structure. The next step connects these points in such a way that they fully represent the surface of the object.

Reference-contexts: Because of the local control property of the NURBS representation scheme, such a one control point adjustment affects only a local portion of the surface. A multiple control point adjustment can have several different effects. See <ref> [Piegl 90] </ref> for a more detailed explanation on this and on the effect of changing the weights. Modification of the knot vectors is usually unpredictable, and thus is not used in most practical applications.

Reference-contexts: In order to create a fully functional part, a designer must have knowledge about the manufacturing methods which are to be used. This principle, which has its roots in concurrent engineering, is called design for manufacture (DFM). According to <ref> [Poli] </ref>, et al., "Design for Manufacturing (DFM) is any aspect of the design process in which the issues of involved in manufacturing the designed object are considered explicitly with a view to influencing the design." However, since doctors cannot be expected to have knowledge of the RP process and engineering design,

Reference-contexts: This decision is based on the fact that cubic polynomials are the lowest degree (simplest) polynomials in which the curvature of the surface patches is continuous <ref> [Shirai] </ref>. In essence, p = q = 3 in equation 4 to ensure continuity across the borders of adjacent surface patches in the two parametric directions, u and v. The u and v parameters vary in the range 0 u; v 1.

Reference-contexts: Finally, he produces a model upon which CSG operations can be applied. Several improvements have been made over the initial GDM model <ref> [Toen] </ref> to allow for escape from local energy minima and optimal detection of missing boundary parts. 3.3 Rapid Prototyping Rapid prototyping technologies have existed for well over 10 years, and they are still developing. <p> However, in anatomical objects, concavities of this nature are rarely present, so this possibility may be disregarded. The image potential can be found by computing the three-dimensional gradient in the image. This method is very computationally expensive, so another criteria must be found that satisfies the image event detector. <ref> [Toen] </ref> developed another method to find the image potential energy. By computing the partial derivative of the image function along the vertices' surface normal directions, it is possible to find the maximal grey-level difference. At an ideal edge, this difference is found in the normal direction.

Reference-contexts: While the energy minimization technique can be solved in O (n) time, extending snakes to 3-D is very computationally expensive. Minimizing the internal energy of a spline surface will require far more time than that of a spline curve. 7 Another type of deformable model was developed by Whitaker <ref> [Whit] </ref> called active blobs. Active blobs are an implicit, rather than parameterized, deformable models that have flexible topology, geometric invariance and a multi-scale representation. Active blobs are a method for both segmentation and visualization of image data, especially 3-D medical data.
