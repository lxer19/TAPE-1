Abstract: Even though the problem of computing Steiner Minimal Trees (SMTs) in the plane is well-known to be N PHard, there exist heuristic algorithms which run in O(N log N) time. Recent research results have shown that the problem in three dimensions is demonstrably more difficult. This paper approaches the development of a heuristic for the problem utilizing the Delaunay Triangulation in 3-space to compute sub-optimal SMTs. Computational results are also provided.

We are employing an implementation of the Delaunay Triangulation based on the work of Beichel and Sullivan [5].

Reference-contexts: Also, since the Euclidean version is known not to be in N P then the complexity of computing optimal Steiner Minimal Trees in d-space d 3 is demonstrably even more difficult <ref> [31] </ref>. In E 2 , see Figure 2, geometric constructions are possible for constructing optimal Steiner trees for small point sets. Figure 2 indicates three alternative methods in the plane for constructing the Steiner point in a triangle. <p> Method (c) is carried out by solving a geometric dual problem which entails constructing the circumscribing triangle of the given triangle with maximum altitude. In contrast, however, optimal geometric constructions are intractable in E 3 since it would require the solution of an eighth-degree polynomial <ref> [31] </ref>. <p> For a collection of other properties see <ref> [31] </ref>. Not all optimal configurations require FST's as we shall see, since some of the given vertices can act as degenerate Steiner points. <p> While the singleton simplex failed to realize the optimal configuration for E 3 , it eventually led to the search 0:8130 for the optimal configuration begun by looking at two tetrahedra as well as gluing various types and combinations of Platonic solids (cubes, octahedron, etc.) together <ref> [31] </ref>. Surprisingly, a breakthrough came when 3 tetrahedra were configured as in Figure 5 where 3 dramatically dropped and continued to drop for increasing numbers of tetrahedra. <p> its substeps can be carried out in constant time if the search process is bounded above by a fixed constant amount of time Otherwise, it will be exponential, in fact, it will require O (2 N N !) time since the numerical solution procedure is a branch and bound algorithm <ref> [31] </ref>. For the most general case where Z are uniformly distributed within the unit cube and where the local optimal solution procedure is bounded by a constant search time C R , Lemma 3 The greedy heuristic will require O (C 1 N 2 ) time.

The following value on the Steiner ratio was conjectured by Smith and Smith in their paper <ref> [33] </ref>. Even if the conjectured value turns out to be incorrect, it acts as a very good upper bound on the optimal ratio. Please see their paper for more details. <p> However, there is no known bound on the ratio of the lengths of heuristic Steiner minimal trees and optimal trees for the SMT in E 3 , only a conjecture on the optimal ratio value <ref> [33] </ref>. 7 Summary and Conclusions In this paper, we have developed an O (n 2 ) heuristic for the Steiner Minimal Tree problem in E 3 .
