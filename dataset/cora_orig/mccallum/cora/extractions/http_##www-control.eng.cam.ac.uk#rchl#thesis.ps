(A reduction factor of 2000 = 0:2mmffi0:1m has to be achieved by the radial controller.) The photo-diode detectors convert physical radial errors into electrical radial errors. This electrical error signal, after linearization around zero, can be modelled as <ref> [BBH + 85, Dra89] </ref> R error = R offset + K optics " (4.1) where " is the physical radial error between the laser spot and the track, measured from the disc centre. <p> The quantity R error is a fluctuating d:c: signal which cannot be used as an indicator signal for control. By inserting an artificial wobble of frequency 600Hz in the radial loop (see <ref> [Dra89, Poh92] </ref> for details), R error is rectified and a drift-free tracking error signal RE := K optics " can be obtained. This signal RE will be used as the radial loop control signal. <p> This actuator is a d:c: motor driven by current. The radial plant is a double integrator with a second order damping system of resonance frequency 3; 700Hz. (Detailed derivation can be found in Appendix F.) The open loop nominal bandwidth (as seen from the external controller) is 400Hz <ref> [Dra89, DSB92, Swi97] </ref>. <p> The variations can be figured out experimentally to have a factor of magnitude between 1=3 and 3 <ref> [Dra89] </ref>. The (Philips) internal radial controller is a proportional-integral (PI) plus a phase lead compensator. The lead component gives a phase advance, and hence closed-loop stability, as the radial plant P rad has a constant phase of 180 ffi . The PI component gives d:c: disturbance rejection. <p> These signals will be used for system identifications and external controls. The constants K CD , K noise , K mon , K error and K ext in Figure 4.1 are transducer gains having the experimentally verified values given in Appendix E and <ref> [Dra89, Swi97] </ref>. The actual internal analog controller differs from the external controller C rad Philips by a constant gain. All the signal measurements, system identification, and controller implementation experiments are performed by the digital signal processor TMS320C40 at a sampling frequency 20kHz.

Reference-contexts: Detailed descriptions and elaborations of the CD player rig can be found in Chapter 4. Apart from the practical motivations, repetitive control raises some interesting theoretical problems in its own. One common strategy in repetitive control is the well-known Internal Model Principle (IMP) <ref> [FW76] </ref>. <p> An example with simulation will be presented in Section 5.5. 5.2 Motivation of Nonlinear Control The goal of repetitive control is to achieve tracking/rejection of some periodic references/disturbances. The Internal Model Principle <ref> [FW76] </ref> suggests that the dynamic structure of the reference/disturbance signals has to be incorporated in the linear controller. This means that when a linear controller is used, it needs to have poles (possibly infinitely many) at the harmonics of the periodic signals.

Reference-contexts: It can be seen from the following proposition that w-stability is not much stronger than the usual internal stability for some plants and controllers. Proposition 2.5.4. <ref> [GS89, GS93] </ref> Let P, C be LTI systems with closed graphs and P; C the respective transfer functions. Then [P; C] is w-stable if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: 1. [P; C] is stable, 2. <p> Even if P is invertible at infinity (unlikely in practice), it is easy to check that the control system fails to be w-stable in the sense of <ref> [GS89, GS93] </ref>. It can be seen that Condition 2 of Proposition 2.5.4 is not satisfied. Thus, asymptotic rejection for all harmonics is not a practicable possibility.

Reference-contexts: We remark that this definition of b P;C depends on the choice of the underlying signal spaces. If U = Y = L 2 (R + ) and P and C are rational and proper, then this definition coincides with the definition in <ref> [GS90] </ref>. <p> Some investigations on robust stability in the discrete-time case were carried out in [Hil94], with the delay stability margin as a robustness measure. Recently, the gap metric robustness margin has been adopted (e.g. <ref> [BDG + 94, GS90] </ref>) as a robustness measure in practice. By using this robustness measure, a clear and handy criterion in determining the robustness compromise of tracking/rejecting certain frequencies is obtained [LS96, LS98c]. Details will be described in subsequent sections.

Reference-contexts: In this dissertation, G denotes the transfer function, if it exists, of the system G. In the L 2 (R + ) case, stable causal LTI systems can be represented as left multiplications by H 1 functions <ref> [Wei91, GS93] </ref>. (Similar results on general spaces L p (R + ) can be found in [Wei91].)

We say that a system G is proper (respectively strictly proper) if it has a transfer function representation and the same is true for its transfer function G. <p> It is fruitful to think of a system in terms of its graph.

Then [P; C] is w-stable if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: 1.

Reference-contexts: Some investigations on robust stability in the discrete-time case were carried out in <ref> [Hil94] </ref>, with the delay stability margin as a robustness measure. Recently, the gap metric robustness margin has been adopted (e.g. [BDG + 94, GS90]) as a robustness measure in practice. <p> In the framework of sampled-data systems, a new induced norm measure with respect to the size of the steady state was proposed [LF94, Lan97]. Similarly, steady state behaviour together with robustness in a discrete-time setting is discussed in <ref> [Hil94] </ref>. In terms of the gap metric robustness margin, a 3.3 Mathematical Preliminaries 25 quantitative trade-off between the steady state and robustness has been given [LS96, LS98c]. <p> Although the consideration of transient state is also important (because for instance a transient state with a slow decaying rate may be problematic), its investigation has been neglected in the past. There were only a few studies in this area concerning for example the placement of closed-loop poles <ref> [Hil94] </ref> and the time domain transient response [WH97]. Recently, Lee and Smith [LS98c] defined a new power-energy induced measure for the transient output of a stable finite dimensional LTI system excited by a periodic signal. <p> Note that g (ff; x) has a maximum of g max = ff 2 (1+ 1ff 2 ) 1+ 1ff 2 , so even with ff = 1, a 50% reduction is always possible. A similar result has been shown in <ref> [Hil94, HS96] </ref>, namely, that a 50% reduction in the steady state was possible with respect to robustness to time delays. 3.5 Transient Performance Consider a signal u = k=1 which is input to a SISO stable rational and proper system with transfer function G (s) (e.g.

Reference-contexts: The controller design methods described there are applied to a Philips CD930 player. Background on the development and full technicalities of compact disc systems can be found in <ref> [BBH + 85, Dra89, NO92, Poh92] </ref>. Therefore, only a concise description of the CD930 player rig (Section 4.2) and the experimental setup (Section 4.3) are given. <p> For illustration, only the radial control unit is considered in this dissertation. Descriptions on the other components of a CD player can be found in <ref> [BBH + 85, Dra89, NO92, Poh92] </ref>. All the standards and schematics in this chapter are based on the Philips CD930 model [Dra89]. 4.2.1 Radial Control Unit The Optical Read Out Unit contains a laser generator, a collimator lens, an objective lens and four photo-diode detectors. <p> The quantity R error is a fluctuating d:c: signal which cannot be used as an indicator signal for control. By inserting an artificial wobble of frequency 600Hz in the radial loop (see <ref> [Dra89, Poh92] </ref> for details), R error is rectified and a drift-free tracking error signal RE := K optics " can be obtained. This signal RE will be used as the radial loop control signal.

Reference-contexts: Next we prescribe a characteristic polynomial A m (e.g. A m = (s + fl) k for some k; fl &gt; 0). The degree of A m can be chosen to be n + 2deg (P ) 1, as suggested in <ref> [RS93, HL97] </ref>. Then solve the Diophantine equation AHR BS = A m for S; R. It is solvable since A; B are coprime and B; H have no common factor. Form the final controller C (s) = (S=HR)(s). In summary: Closed-loop Pole Placement Design Procedure 1. <p> For the closed-loop pole placement method, the number of closed-loop poles is chosen to be 7 + 2 fi 2 1 = 10 (suggested in <ref> [RS93] </ref>). The closed-loop poles are selected at a, a, a and a + j 7 for some a &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: It is known, for instance, that the output of a stable rational and proper system excited by a periodic signal consists of a periodic steady state (of the same fundamental frequency) and a finite energy transient state <ref> [LF94, Lan97, Wei96, WH97, LS98c] </ref>. In the framework of sampled-data systems, a new induced norm measure with respect to the size of the steady state was proposed [LF94, Lan97]. Similarly, steady state behaviour together with robustness in a discrete-time setting is discussed in [Hil94].

Reference-contexts: It is known, for instance, that the output of a stable rational and proper system excited by a periodic signal consists of a periodic steady state (of the same fundamental frequency) and a finite energy transient state <ref> [LF94, Lan97, Wei96, WH97, LS98c] </ref>. In the framework of sampled-data systems, a new induced norm measure with respect to the size of the steady state was proposed [LF94, Lan97]. Similarly, steady state behaviour together with robustness in a discrete-time setting is discussed in [Hil94]. <p> There were only a few studies in this area concerning for example the placement of closed-loop poles [Hil94] and the time domain transient response <ref> [WH97] </ref>. Recently, Lee and Smith [LS98c] defined a new power-energy induced measure for the transient output of a stable finite dimensional LTI system excited by a periodic signal. The relation of transient state, expressed by this induced measure, and robustness can also be found in [LS96, HL97, LS98c]. <p> It is possible to show using the techniques of Weiss and Hafele 1997 (see Lemma 9 and Proposition 11 of <ref> [WH97] </ref>) that we can decompose the output y 1 , where ^y 1 = G^u 0 for u 0 = P 1 T (! 0 ), uniquely as: y 1 = y 1;ss + y 1;tr where y 1;ss = P 1 L 2 (R + ) (see Appendix A for <p> Define L 2fi (R + ) as the space of all functions of the form v (t) = e fit u (t), where u 2 L 2 (R + ).
