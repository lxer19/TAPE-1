Reference-contexts: Definition 2.3. Let DR bg be the collection of all pairs (Y; X) for which X is a bg strong deformation retract of Y . The collection of equivalence classes of such pairs under elementary expansions and collapses rel X is denoted W h bg (X). We refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for the definitions of controlled bases, controlled modules and RPG 1 (X) modules. Definition 2.4. Let X be a metric space, R a ring. A controlled basis is a pro-object defined as follows. <p> f : X ! Y so that for every R &gt; 0 there exists S &gt; 0 with d (x; x 0 ) R implying d (f (x); f (x 0 )) S: A coarse homotopy from X to Y is a continuous and proper map h : X fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! Y so that for every R &gt; 0 there exists S &gt; 0 with d (x; x 0 ) R implying d (h (x; t); h (x 0 ; t)) S for all t 2 [0; 1]. <p> to Y is a continuous and proper map h : X fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! Y so that for every R &gt; 0 there exists S &gt; 0 with d (x; x 0 ) R implying d (h (x; t); h (x 0 ; t)) S for all t 2 [0; 1]. Two coarse f 0 ; f 1 : X ! Y are coarsely homotopic if there is a coarse homotopy h : X fi [0; 1] ! Y so that f 0 (x) = h (x; 0) A coarse map f : X ! Y is a coarse homotopy <p> &gt; 0 with d (x; x 0 ) R implying d (h (x; t); h (x 0 ; t)) S for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Two coarse f 0 ; f 1 : X ! Y are coarsely homotopic if there is a coarse homotopy h : X fi [0; 1] ! Y so that f 0 (x) = h (x; 0) A coarse map f : X ! Y is a coarse homotopy equivalence if there is a coarse map g : Y !

QUASI-ISOMETRY CLASSIFICATION OF COARSE HADAMARD MANIFOLDS 25 The main advantage of using bounded geometry is that extension problems can be solved first homotopically, using the obstruction theory for controlled maps due essentially to Anderson and Munkholm <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. The result is a bg homotopy equivalence, which needs to be converted into a quasi-isometry, or in the negatively curved context, into a quasiconformal map. <p> A coarse quasi-isometry of H n+1 can be extended to a continuous bg homotopy equivalence of H n+1 to itself, as can be seen by applying the controlled homotopy theory of <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 0.4 then implies that this map is bg homotopic to a bg homeomorphism. Proof of Theorem 0.5. Equip D with the quasi-hyperbolic metric defined by using the density dist (x; @D) 1 j dx j. The following is a theorem of Heinonen and Yang [15]: Theorem 4.18.

Reference-contexts: The technique used for proving these results will be the controlled surgery theory developed by the author for classifying manifolds of bounded geometry up to smooth quasi-isometry. A manifold of bounded geometry (bg) is a non-compact manifold whose geometric complexity is bounded. This paper is a sequel to <ref> [2] </ref> and [3], in which we initiated the classification of bg manifolds up to quasi-isometry, which is the bg analogue of homeomorphism. <p> Pansu asked whether this could be generalized to complex hyperbolic space. We show in this article that this is the case, and that the extension result holds in even more generality, namely the case of manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature. QUASI-ISOMETRY CLASSIFICATION OF COARSE HADAMARD MANIFOLDS 5 In <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] we proved that the bg simple structure set of M fi R n was given by H fl (R n ; S fl (M )), where the precise definition of this group can be found in [2], [3]. <p> QUASI-ISOMETRY CLASSIFICATION OF COARSE HADAMARD MANIFOLDS 5 In <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] we proved that the bg simple structure set of M fi R n was given by H fl (R n ; S fl (M )), where the precise definition of this group can be found in [2], [3]. <p> Let M n , n 5 be a uniformly contractible smooth manifold of bounded geometry so that there is a map f : M ! H n so that f is EPL in the sense of [6] or a coarse map of bounded geometry in the sense of <ref> [2] </ref>. Then M is quasi-isometric to H n . This gives another proof of an extension result of Tukia and Vaisala [23], which states that quasi-conformal mappings of R n can be extended to quasi-conformal mappings of the half-space one dimension higher. <p> Finally, I would like to thank M.Culler,R. Edwards, S.Hurder, H. Masur, G.Mess, Andrew Ranicki for criticisms. 1.Uniformly finite homology The definitions of uniformly finite homology and fine uniformly finite homology can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>, [6]. We first recall some fundamental facts about uniformly finite homology. Definition 1.1. <p> The boundary is defined to be the natural linear extension of the singular boundary. We write the resulting homology H uff We will adopt the conventions of <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] and use the "quantized" norm given by taking each chain to have coefficients lying in a finite subset of G. The following is a theorem of Gromov, Block and Weinberger (see [2], p.513): Theorem 1.4. <p> We write the resulting homology H uff We will adopt the conventions of <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] and use the "quantized" norm given by taking each chain to have coefficients lying in a finite subset of G. The following is a theorem of Gromov, Block and Weinberger (see [2], p.513): Theorem 1.4. Let X be a simply connected n-dimensional symmetric space of non-positive curvature of rank r. Then H i (X; Z) = 0 for i n r 1 uff Definition 1.5. <p> Here ff i is the angle between fl i+1 and fl i+2 . 2.Whitehead group calculation We recall the definitions from <ref> [2] </ref>. Definition 2.1. A CW-complex of bounded geometry is defined to be a CW-complex with a uniformly bounded number of cells attached to each cell and a finite number of homeomorphism types of attaching maps. <p> It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that this group is isomorphic to W h bg (X). Definition 2.9. The bounded Whitehead group W h bdd (X) is defined to be a quotient of K 1 of the category ZPG 1 (X). <p> Theorem 2.17. W h bg (M fi H n ) = H uff Proof. We proved this theorem for n = 1 in <ref> [2] </ref>. To do the general case, we first consider the case n = 2. <p> The converse goes by an analogue of <ref> [2] </ref> where a radius R + replaces the real line R. An element [A; ff] is defined to be split at a point in R + if the automorphism ff preserves the two parts of R + below and above the point. <p> nel of the map is represented by elements of C uff 0 (H 2 ; W h (M )), modulo infinite process tricks which identify different elements of W h bg (M fi H 2 ), which yields H uff 0 (H 2 ; W h (M )), as in <ref> [2] </ref>. However, this is zero. We will be finished with the calculation as soon as we have analyzed the kernel of the map W h bg (1) (M fi H 2 ) ! K 1 (M ) and show that both maps considered are split surjective. <p> The rest follows identically as in the hyperbolic case. 3. Proof of the Main Theorem We apply a version of the splitting theorem of <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 3.1. Let h : M ! N be a bg homotopy equivalence, where M is the Cartesian product of a compact manifold with H n , or a simply connected Hadamard manifold V n , n 5 and N is bg over H n , V respectively. <p> Proof. The proof is like the Euclidean case in <ref> [2] </ref>, except that the splitting is along compact submanifolds, but growing in diameter and volume. <p> This surgery uses the hypothesis that the components of X are sufficiently separated from each other to insure that the Nil obstructions vanish. This, along 22 OLIVER ATTIE with the details of <ref> [2] </ref>, completes the proof. In addition to the splitting along spheres, we need to split along hyperplanes in the direction of the radii. By this we essentially mean hyperplanes in the normal direction to the spheres in the warped product decomposition of H n . Theorem 3.2. <p> Proof. The proof is completely analogous to the previous theorem and to the theorem in <ref> [2] </ref>, and so will be omitted. Definition 3.3. We denote by S bg;i (M ) the PL bg structure set with simple homo-topy equivalences replaced by maps with torsion in K bg i (M ) equal to zero. Proof of 0.1. We apply Theorem 3.1 in the following manner. <p> This follows from the theorem of Farrell-Jones [9]: W h ( fi G) = H fl (; W h fl (G)) N ils along with the calculation of the Whitehead group in section 4, proposition 2.10 in <ref> [2] </ref> and the observation that any given element of the Nils vanishes on a finite cover. We then apply the calculation of the structure set, Theorem 0.1 above. Applying proposition 2.10 of [2], we obtain a rational injection of H fl (; S (M )) ! H fl (H n ; <p> fl (G)) N ils along with the calculation of the Whitehead group in section 4, proposition 2.10 in <ref> [2] </ref> and the observation that any given element of the Nils vanishes on a finite cover. We then apply the calculation of the structure set, Theorem 0.1 above. Applying proposition 2.10 of [2], we obtain a rational injection of H fl (; S (M )) ! H fl (H n ; S (M )) for the top two dimensions. <p> Hence quasiconformal maps can be treated as quasi-isometries.

Reference-contexts: We will also need the analogue of the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem for warped products in the uniformly finite homology and cohomology theories. This theorem similar to the one due to the author and J.Block in the unwarped case which appears in <ref> [4] </ref>. Definition 1.7. Let X be a smooth manifold of bounded geometry. Let g be a positive smooth function on X. Let G be a normed group. <p> Then fi (X fi w Y ) = fi (X; w mk k We thus obtain the chain level description on differential forms: n M i j Since we are neglecting torision, we can then pass to simplicial chains using the de Rham theorem of <ref> [4] </ref>. n uff (X fi w Y ; Z) fi (X; w mj fi (Y )) !

Before proving the theorem of Tukia-Vaisala, we need a few definitions. (See <ref> [12] </ref> for the definitions, and [13], p.99, Example 18.A.(b) for the case of symmetric spaces).

Reference-contexts: If X is a 30 OLIVER ATTIE ffi-hyperbolic metric space then the Gromov boundary of X is the set of equivalence classes of quasi-rays in X. We will use a particular conformal structure on the boundary. The following definitions are due to Gromov and Pansu: Definition 4.16 <ref> [14] </ref>. Let X be a manifold with pinched negative sectional curvature. Every two points s 1 and s 2 in the sphere at infinity @X can be joined by a unique geodesic in X, denoted (s 1 ; s 2 ). <p> Definition 4.17 <ref> [14] </ref>. A coarse quasi-isometry f : X !

We observe that every quasiconformal map of @X extends to a coarse quasi-isometry. See <ref> [14] </ref>, where other conformal structures on @X are discussed, for which this extension property is not known in general. The converse was first observed for hyperbolic spaces in [8].

[1; 1) be an increasing function and m &lt; n a non-negative integer. <p> The domain of definition of f is a net in X while the image of f is a net in Y . Note that the term coarse used here differs from the term coarse as used by Higson and Roe <ref> [15] </ref>, and used above in Definition 2.18, where a coarse map is required to be continuous. We observe that every quasiconformal map of @X extends to a coarse quasi-isometry.

Proof of Theorem 0.5. Equip D with the quasi-hyperbolic metric defined by using the density dist (x; @D) 1 j dx j. The following is a theorem of Heinonen and Yang <ref> [15] </ref>: Theorem 4.18. A domain D is m-uniform if and only if it is both uniform and QHC (m). As a corollary to this theorem, we see that D is strongly uniform also in the quasi-hyperbolic metric.

Reference-contexts: In order to prove this result we need to recall the correspondance between quasi-conformal structures and bg structures in the hyperbolic case. This correspondance 28 OLIVER ATTIE is discussed by P.Pansu in <ref> [17] </ref>. Pansu also discusses in [17] generalizations of this correspondance which he proves elsewhere, and which we will make use of below. We first define the isoperimetric profile of a manifold. Definition 4.9. <p> In order to prove this result we need to recall the correspondance between quasi-conformal structures and bg structures in the hyperbolic case. This correspondance 28 OLIVER ATTIE is discussed by P.Pansu in <ref> [17] </ref>. Pansu also discusses in [17] generalizations of this correspondance which he proves elsewhere, and which we will make use of below. We first define the isoperimetric profile of a manifold. Definition 4.9. <p> Definition 4.11. Let M be a Riemannian manifold. We define the conformal pseudo-distance fi as follows: fi (x; y) = inf fcap (M; B; 1) : B is compact, connected and contains x and yg Observation 4.12. A quasiconformal map is bg with respect to fi. Theorem 4.13 (Pansu <ref> [17] </ref>). Assume that an n-dimensional complete Riemann-ian manifold M of bounded geometry satisfies a strictly stronger isoperimetric inequality that Euclidean n-space, i.e the integral Z +1 is finite. Then the conformal pseudo-distance fi is a distance. <p> Proof. This follows in the same way as in the hyperbolic case. We use the last 32 OLIVER ATTIE statement of theorem 4.13. Remark 4.20. The final statement of Theorem 4.13 is false in the case of solvman-ifolds of negative curvature. See <ref> [17] </ref>. 5. Topological Invariance of Pontrjagin Classes The topological invariance of Pontrjagin classes was proven by S. Novikov in 1965. Here we give an alternative to the method of Pedersen, Roe and Weinberger, using surgery on manifolds of bounded geometry, answering a question posed in that article. Theorem.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove the same results for general Hadamard manifolds, along with even more general quasi-conformal mapping theorems. A consequence of this will be that we will be able to answer a question posed by P.Pansu in <ref> [19] </ref>, p.47. Tukia proved in [22] that every quasiconformal map of the sphere at infinity of hyperbolic space can be extended to a quasiisometry. Pansu asked whether this could be generalized to complex hyperbolic space.

Reference-contexts: It measures the obstruction to a bg projective module being free. Definition 2.15. The category C n (R) of Z n -graded objects and bounded homomor-phisms over a ring R is defined as in <ref> [20] </ref> as follows. An object is a collection of objects A (J ) and a morphism is a collection (J; K) : A (J ) ! B (K) so that (J; K) = 0 unless k J K k d for some d. <p> Now note that the last group is known, due to Pedersen <ref> [20] </ref> coupled with the following discussion, to be K 1 (M ). Definition 2.18 [16]. Let X and Y be metric spaces in which closed and bounded sets are compact. <p> For if an element is bg split along circles, then by QUASI-ISOMETRY CLASSIFICATION OF COARSE HADAMARD MANIFOLDS 19 the infinite process trick of <ref> [20] </ref>, one can move each module at each lattice point out to infinity along the radii without violating the loosened boundedness condition. The converse goes by an analogue of [2] where a radius R + replaces the real line R. <p> Elements of the kernel of this map are split by the argument of <ref> [20] </ref>. Moreover this map is the forgetful map to K 1 (M ). Furthermore, applying an infinite process trick due to Swan (see [20] for a description) yields a surjection onto K 1 (M ) and shows in fact that any element of K 1 (M ) can be represented by <p> Elements of the kernel of this map are split by the argument of <ref> [20] </ref>.

Furthermore, applying an infinite process trick due to Swan (see [20] for a description) yields a surjection onto K 1 (M ) and shows in fact that any element of K 1 (M ) can be represented by a bg (1)-controlled element over H 2 . <p> We use the version which is described on p. 472 of <ref> [20] </ref>. We next analyze the map W h bg (M fi H 2 ) ! W h bg (1) (M fi H 2 ). We claim that the kernel of this map is zero. Elements of the kernel of the map are bg split simultaneously along circles and radii.

Reference-contexts: We also claim that the splitting preserves the group structures on the various structure sets involved. This can be seen, for example by converting the whole argument into algebraic L-theory and using Ranicki's description of the structure set as an L-group <ref> [21] </ref>. One then imitates the argument for the Whitehead group to see that the group structures are preserved by the splitting. Proof of Theorem 0.2. This follows from the first main theorem except for some low dimensional difficulties, which are taken care of by Siebenmann periodicity. <p> addition, to go from a continuous EPL map to a smooth quasi-isometry, we make use of the fact that the Casson-Sullivan invariant is a modulo 2 invariant, so that every homeomorphism from a contractible manifold of bounded geometry to hyperbolic space is bg homotopic to a bg PL homeomorphism. (See <ref> [21] </ref>). Proof of Theorem 0.6. We first observe that a map f : M fi X n ! N lifts to a bg simple homotopy equivalence on the hyperbolic cover if and only if it is simple on 24 OLIVER ATTIE a finite cover.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove the same results for general Hadamard manifolds, along with even more general quasi-conformal mapping theorems. A consequence of this will be that we will be able to answer a question posed by P.Pansu in [19], p.47.

Reference-contexts: Then M is quasi-isometric to H n . This gives another proof of an extension result of Tukia and Vaisala <ref> [23] </ref>, which states that quasi-conformal mappings of R n can be extended to quasi-conformal mappings of the half-space one dimension higher. In addition, we are able to derive a new result more general than the Tukia-Vaisala theorem. Theorem 0.5. <p> Finally, we give a generalization of the Tukia-Vaisala theorem <ref> [23] </ref> to strongly uniform domains. This application was suggested to the author by S.Semmes.
