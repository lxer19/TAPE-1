Abstract: This paper 1 describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a reliable multicast framework for application level framing and light-weight sessions. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been pro-totyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies. 1 An earlier version of this paper appeared in ACM SIGCOMM 95.

Reference-contexts: To avoid keeping all the data forever, the sequencer keeps track of the receiving state of all the members to determine the highest sequence number that has been correctly received by all the members. MTP (Multicasting Transport Protocol) <ref> [AFM92] </ref> is again a centralized scheme for totally ordered multicast delivery. A master site is responsible for granting membership and tokens for data transmission; each host must obtain a token from the master first before multicasting data to the group, thus the total order of data packets is maintained.

Reference-contexts: The reliable multicast delivery in existing ISIS implementations is achieved by multiple uni-cast connections using a windowed acknowledgment protocol similar to TCP <ref> [B93] </ref>. Horus, the successor to ISIS, can optionally run on top of IP multicast. 10 Future work 10.1 Future work on local recovery Section 7.2 has shown that local recovery based on local-recovery neighborhoods can be quite effective in limiting the unnecessary use of bandwidth in loss recovery events.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most well-known work on reliable multicast is the ISIS distributed programming system developed at Cor-nell University <ref> [BSS91, ISIS] </ref>. ISIS provides causal ordering and, if desired, total ordering of messages on top of a reliable multicast delivery protocol.

Reference-contexts: As another approach to assure a certain amount of bandwidth for a session, receivers could reserve resources where such network services were available; an example of such services are the predictive and controlled delay services currently being developed for the Internet <ref> [BCS94] </ref>. We believe that it should be the choice of individual members whether to reserve resources or to rely on best effort service for a session; the use of services other than best-effort should not be a mandated requirement for all members of a multicast group.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we focus on the different goals and definitions of reliability in the various architectures, and the implications of these differences for the scalability, robustness, handling of dynamic group membership, and overhead of the algorithms. The Chang and Maxemchuk protocol <ref> [CM84] </ref> is one of the pioneer works in reliable multicast protocols. It is basically a centralized scheme that provides totally ordered delivery of data to all group members. All the members are ordered in a logical ring, with one of them being the master, called the token site.

Reference-contexts: As <ref> [CS93] </ref> has shown, for applications with ordering requirements, preserving the ordering of messages as they appear in the network is often an expensive and inadequate substitute for preserving the semantic ordering of the messages appropriate for the application. 9 Related work on reliable multicast The literature is rich with architectures for

Reference-contexts: The weakness of one size fits all protocols has long been recognized. In 1990 Clark and Tennenhouse proposed a new protocol model called Application Level Framing (ALF) which explicitly includes an application's semantics in the design of that application's protocol <ref> [CT90] </ref>. ALF was later elaborated with a light-weight rendezvous mechanism based 1 on the IP multicast distribution model, and with a notion of receiver-based adaptation for unreliable, real-time applications such as audio and video conferencing. <p> Thus the naming in application data units (ADUs) model works far better for multicast. Use of this model also has two beneficial side effects. As <ref> [CT90] </ref> points out, a separate protocol namespace can impose delays and inefficiencies on an application, e.g., TCP will only deliver data in sequence even though a file transfer application might be perfectly happy to receive sectors in any order.

Reference-contexts: Because of the fate-sharing implicit in unicast communication, i.e., the data transmission fails if either of the two ends fails, either the sender or receiver can take on this role. In TCP, the sender times transmissions and keeps retransmitting until an acknowledgment is received. NETBLT <ref> [CLZ87] </ref> uses the opposite model and makes the receiver responsible for all loss detection and recovery. Both approaches have been shown to work well for unicast. However, if a TCP-style, sender-based approach is applied to multicast distribution, a number of problems occur.
