Reference-contexts: This performance is determined by a combination of: (1) the phase noise in the tunable, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), (2) the bandwidth and architecture of the frequency synthesizer PLL. Research efforts to this point have explored the phase noise performance of CMOS ring oscillators for possible use as VCOs <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Ring-oscillator are easy to integrate on chip, and do not require the off-chip tunable capacitor (varactor) required in most LC-tank type oscillators. Although phase noise performance is typically worse than in tuned oscillators, ring-oscillator phase noise improves with power consumption at a rate of 10 dB per decade.

Reference-contexts: The result is a higher potential PLL loop bandwidth for a given channel spacing. This approach should yield performance improvements similar to those found in other fractional synthesis techniques <ref> [3, 4] </ref>; however, spurious tones should depend on feedback phase linearity which is potentially better than the tone-generating mechanisms in conventional fractional synthesis. The spurious tone performance is expected to be better than the DDS / Mixer approach as well.
