Title: Path Failure in Cylinderical Mesh Networks

Abstract: The problem of node failures in interconnection networks has been extensively studied. In this paper we define the notion of a more catastrophic form of failure | path failure | in which a sequence of nodes from a source to a sink in the network fail. The corresponding collapse in the structural properties of the underlying network is analyzed in quantitative terms, as a function of network size, by using the notion of catastrophic failure. We examine this problem in a fixed setting, that of the cylinderical mesh, a network designed to maximize the number of communication routes between a set of producers and a set of consumers. Our proofs use interesting graph theoretic and combinatorial techniques, and formally establish that connectivity is drastically effected by path failure.

Reference-contexts: These networks, called cylinderical meshes, are amenable to analysis combinatorially and have an elegant relationship with Fibonacci networks, first introduced by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Circus, <ref> [Gar79] </ref>, to study the paths of bees in a bee hive formed of hexagonal cells. Geometrically, these networks are based on Schwarz's polyhedron, which, as described in [Wel91], shows that that, when computing the areas of surfaces through approximation intuition can be misleading and sometimes actually wrong. <p> The specific network chosen is the m stage generalization of the 2-stage network studied in Lemma 2.2, and is of independent interest as a generalization of Martin Gardner's <ref> [Gar79] </ref> description of a bee's walk through a hexagonal grid. Definition 6.2 For all k 1 the string y opt (k) is (01) k div 2 if k is even and is the string (01) k div 2 0 if k is odd.

Reference-contexts: The switches along the link are unavailable during transmission, thus altering the structure of the network temporarily. Another useful application of these networks is presented in <ref> [Ram92] </ref>, where these networks were encountered as the underlying structure for an algorithm to approximate optimization functions from the structural complexity class OptP, which contains optimal solution search analogs of decision problems in NP.

Reference-contexts: Geometrically, these networks are based on Schwarz's polyhedron, which, as described in <ref> [Wel91] </ref>, shows that that, when computing the areas of surfaces through approximation intuition can be misleading and sometimes actually wrong. Path failures can be viewed as time bounded phenomena in the case of circuit switching networks, where a message sender establishes a dedicated link to a receiver.
