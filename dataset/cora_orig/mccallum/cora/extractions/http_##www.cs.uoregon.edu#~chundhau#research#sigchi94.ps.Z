Reference-contexts: not only well illustrate my approachs value, but also point to the need for further empirically-based SV research, which should play a central role in the development of more usable HISV systems. 10 To learn about these three specification methods, our subjects studied brief descriptions of each method adapted from <ref> (Roman & Cox 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Early SV systems such as Balsa (Brown 1987) and Tango <ref> (Stasko 1990) </ref> defined conceptual models in which different actors performed those activities.. In the Balsa model, for example, client programmers algorithmaticians and animators were responsible for designing and specifying the algorithm-to-graphics mapping, whereas the end users s cript authors and script viewers actually observed the mappings (see Figure 1).
