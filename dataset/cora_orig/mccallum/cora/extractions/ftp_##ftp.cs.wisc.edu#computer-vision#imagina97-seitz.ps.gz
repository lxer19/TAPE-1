Abstract: Photographs and paintings are limited in the amount of information they can convey due to their inherent lack of motion and depth. Using image morphing methods, it is now possible to add 2D motion to photographs by moving and blending image pixels in creative ways. We have taken this concept a step further by adding the ability to convey three-dimensional motions, such as scene rotations and viewpoint changes, by manipulating one or more photographs of a scene. The effect transforms a photograph or painting into an interactive visualization of the underlying object or scene in which the world may be rotated in 3D. Several potential applications of this technology are discussed, in areas such as virtual reality, image databases, and special effects.

Reference-contexts: The illusion of a real three-dimensional space is maintained by continually warping the images to correspond to the user's changing perspective. Current systems like Apple's Quicktime VR <ref> [1] </ref> provide a first step in this direction. The ability to change viewpoint can be combined with other uses of morphing to create better special effects. <p> The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the geometry of the underlying scene is generally not known. Nevertheless, we and other researchers in graphics and computer vision <ref> [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] </ref> have made significant advances in this area, to the point where practical morphing-based scene visualizations are now becoming a reality.

Reference-contexts: Current systems like Apple's Quicktime VR [1] provide a first step in this direction. The ability to change viewpoint can be combined with other uses of morphing to create better special effects. To morph two faces using current methods <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, the heads need to be roughly aligned or else severe distortions can arise during the transition. By compensating for changes in viewpoint, however, it is possible to create very effective morphs, even under large changes in object pose.

Reference-contexts: View morphing is therefore powerful enough to be applied to any two images, regardless of source or content. Details on how the warps are computed can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. 3 Applications In this section we describe three types of potential applications for view morphing that we are currently investigating.
