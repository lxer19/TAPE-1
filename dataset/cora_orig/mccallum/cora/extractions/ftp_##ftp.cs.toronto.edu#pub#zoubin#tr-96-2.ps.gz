Abstract: Technical Report CRG-TR-96-2 February 22, 1996 Abstract Linear systems have been used extensively in engineering to model and control the behavior of dynamical systems. In this note, we present the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the parameters of linear systems (Shumway and Stoffer, 1982). We also point out the relationship between linear dynamical systems, factor analysis, and hidden Markov models.

We first describe the M step of the parameter estimation algorithm before showing how the above expectations are computed in the E step. 3 1 The M step The parameters of this system are A, C, R, Q, 1 , V 1 .

Reference-contexts: If both inputs and outputs are observed, the problem becomes supervised, modeling the conditional density of the output given the input. Related Methods In its unsupervised incarnation, this model is an extension of maximum likelihood factor analysis <ref> (Everitt, 1984) </ref>. The factor, x t , evolves over time according to linear dynamics. In factor analysis, a further assumption is made that the output noise along each dimension 2 is uncorrelated, i.e. that R is diagonal.

Reference-contexts: The forward part of the forward-backward algorithm from HMMs is computed by the well-known Kalman filter in LDSs; similarly, the backward part is computed by using Rauch's recursion <ref> (Rauch, 1963) </ref>. Together, these two recursions can be used to solve the problem of inferring the probabilities probabilities of the states given the observation sequence (known in engineering as the smoothing problem). These posterior probabilities form the basis of the E step of the EM algorithm.
