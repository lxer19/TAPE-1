Abstract: A new MHD code has been developed for massively parallel computers using adaptive mesh reflnement (AMR) and a new 8-wave Riemann solver. The code was implemented on a Cray T3D massively parallel computer with 512 PEs. In the flrst application, which modeled the expansion of the solar wind from the solar surface, the code achieved 13 GFLOPS.

Reference-contexts: The method is called Multiscale Adaptive Upwind Scheme for Magnetohydrodynamics (MAUS-MHD). MAUS-MHD is based on two key ingradients that are extremely well suited to heliosphere modeling. The flrst is a data structure that allows for adaptive reflnement of the mesh in regions of interest <ref> (De Zeeuw and Powell, 1992) </ref>, and the second is an upwind scheme (van Leer, 1979) based on a new approximate Riemann solver for ideal MHD. <p> To this end, we have chosen a block-based tree structure, which is a generalization of the cell-based tree used in our earlier work <ref> (De Zeeuw and Powell, 1992) </ref>. The root of the block-based tree is a structured coarse grid that covers the entire ow domain.

The Riemann solver based on the eight equations given by (1) and (11), as shown in (Gombosi et al., 1994; 1996; Powell 1994; Powell, 1996), has substantially better numerical properties than one based on the form in which the source term is not accounted for.
