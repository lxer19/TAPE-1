Title: Distributional Regularity and Phonotactic Constraints are Useful for Segmentation  
Author: Michael R. Brent and Timothy A. Cartwright 
Date: November 16, 1995  
Abstract: In order to acquire a lexicon, young children must segment speech into words, even though most words are unfamiliar to them. This is a non-trivial task because speech lacks any acoustic analog of the blank spaces between printed words. Two sources of information that might be useful for this task are distributional regularity and phonotactic constraints. Informally, distributional regularity refers to the intuition that sound sequences that occur frequently and in a variety of contexts are better candidates for the lexicon than those that occur rarely or in few contexts. We express that intuition formally by a class of functions called DR functions. We then put forth three hypotheses: First, that children segment using DR functions. Second, that they exploit phonotactic constraints on the possible pronunciations of words in their language. Specifically, they exploit both the requirement that every word must have a vowel and the constraints that languages impose constraints on word-initial and word-final consonant clusters. Third, that children learn which word-boundary clusters are permitted in their language by assuming that all permissible word-boundary clusters will eventually occur at utterance boundaries. Using computational simulation, we investigate the effectiveness of these strategies for segmenting broad phonetic transcripts of child-directed English. The results show that DR functions and phonotactic constraints can be used to significantly improve segmentation. Further, the contributions of DR functions and phonotactic constraints are largely independent, so using both yields better segmentation than using either one alone. Finally, learning the permissible word-boundary

Reference-contexts: Only words that occur in isolation can be learned. Some words|determiners, for instance|are very unlikely to occur in isolation. Even when instructed to teach their 12-month-olds a noun referring to a body part, some mothers use that word in isolation rarely or not at all <ref> (Aslin, Wood ward, LaMendola, & Bever, 1996) </ref>. 3. Adults are obviously able to learn new words by segmenting them out of multi-word utterances. The proposal that infants learn words by some completely separate mechanism implies a maturational switch whose mechanism remains unexplained. <p> Children learn the phonotactic constraints of their language from unsegmented utterances. Thus, the learning of phonotactic constraints does not depend on the success of early attempts at segmentation. Specifically, they learn the legal boundary clusters of their language by attend ing to utterance boundaries <ref> (Aslin et al., 1996) </ref>. The first hypothesis leaves open the question of which DR function children use, or even whether all children use precisely the same one. Rather, it rests on the notion that a wide variety of DR functions are useful for segmentation.

Reference-contexts: MRL is rooted in statistical inference and can be viewed as a mathematical generalization of the Maximum-Likelihood approach Olivier used. MRL has been applied to language (e.g., Ellison, in press; Stolcke & Omohundro, 1994) and to modeling language acquisition <ref> (Brent, Gafos, & Cartwright, 1994) </ref>. The representational schema illustrated in Figure 2, while simple, is by no means unique. A number of variations are possible. For example, word indices could be represented using only the binary digits 0 and 1 rather than the decimal digits 0 through 9.

Reference-contexts: They acquire words by entering the single-word utterances into their mental lexicons. This idea has several weaknesses: 1. No adequate method for discriminating between single-word and multi word utterances has ever been proposed <ref> (Christophe, Dupoux, Bertoncini, & Mehler, 1994) </ref>. 2. Only words that occur in isolation can be learned. Some words|determiners, for instance|are very unlikely to occur in isolation. <p> Further, French infants can distinguish phonemically identical sound sequences that differ only in whether they were spliced out of sentences in which they spanned a word boundary <ref> (Christophe et al., 1994) </ref>. Another frequently discussed strategy is based on regularities in the rhythmic forms of words. For example, initial syllables of English content words rarely have reduced vowels (Cutler & Carter, 1987, estimate 10%).

Reference-contexts: For example, stop consonants tend to be aspirated more strongly when they occur word-initially than when they occur word-internally <ref> (Church, 1987) </ref>. In French, when a vowel followed by a stop consonant spans a word boundary, both the vowel and the stop closure tend be longer than when the same phonemes occur word-internally.

Reference-contexts: In Experiments 2-4 below we investigate the usefulness of these constraints for segmentation. Although there are cross-linguistic generalizations, the specific sequences permitted by each of the three constraints vary from language to language. 2 Although there is a great deal of interesting theory involving phonotactic constraints <ref> (e.g., Clements, 1990, and references therein) </ref>, refining the crude description supplied here would distract from our main point.
