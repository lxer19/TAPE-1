Reference-contexts: The only significant protocol change in SNTP Version 4 over previous versions of NTP and SNTP is a modified header interpretation to accommodate Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) [4] and OSI <ref> [1] </ref> addressing. However, SNTP Version 4 includes certain optional extensions to the basic Version 3 model, including an anycast mode and an authentication scheme designed specifically for multicast and anycast modes.

Reference-contexts: Note also that leap seconds are not counted in the reckoning. 4. NTP Message Format Both NTP and SNTP are clients of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [11], which itself is a client of the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [2] </ref>. The structure of the IP and UDP headers is described in the cited specification documents and will not be detailed further here. The UDP port number assigned to NTP is 123, which should be used in both the Source Port and Destination Port fields in the UDP header.

Reference-contexts: Multicast clients listen on the designated local broadcast address or multicast group address. In the case of local broadcast addresses, no further provisions are necessary. In the case of IP multi-cast addresses, the multicast client and anycast server must implement the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [3] </ref>, in order that the local router joins the multicast group and relays messages to the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast group addresses assigned by the IANA.

Open Software Foundation, </institution> <month> June </month> <year> 1991, </year> <pages> 8 pp. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Each SNTP packet is transmitted as the TS-Userdata parameter of a TUNITDATA Request primitive. Alternately, the header can be encapsulated in a TPDU which itself is transported using UDP <ref> [5] </ref>. It is not advised that NTP be operated at the upper layers of the OSI stack, such as might be inferred from [6], as this could seriously degrade accuracy.

It is not advised that NTP be operated at the upper layers of the OSI stack, such as might be inferred from <ref> [6] </ref>, as this could seriously degrade accuracy. With the header formats defined in this document, it is in principle possible to interwork between servers and clients of one protocol family and another, although the practical difficulties may make this inadvisable.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the use of SNTP rather than NTP in primary servers should be carefully considered. An important provision in this document is the reinterpretation of certain NTP Version 4 header fields which provide for IPv6 <ref> [7] </ref> and OSI addressing and optional anycast extensions similar to [10] designed specifically for multicast service. These additions are in conjunction with the proposed NTP Version 4 specification, which will appear as a separate document.

Reference-contexts: In Version 4 secondary servers and clients, it contains the low order 32 bits of the last transmit times-tamp received from the synchronization source. 3 In the case of OSI, the Connectionless Transport Service (CLTS) is used <ref> [8] </ref>. Each SNTP packet is transmitted as the TS-Userdata parameter of a TUNITDATA Request primitive. Alternately, the header can be encapsulated in a TPDU which itself is transported using UDP [5].

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Network Time Protocol (NTP) Version 3 specified in RFC-1305 <ref> [9] </ref> is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the global Internet. It provides comprehensive mechanisms to access national time and frequency dissemination services, organize the timesynchronization subnet and adjust the local clock in each participating subnet peer.

Reference-contexts: Note that when calculating the correspondence, 2000 is not a leap year. Note also that leap seconds are not counted in the reckoning. 4. NTP Message Format Both NTP and SNTP are clients of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [11] </ref>, which itself is a client of the Internet Protocol (IP) [2].

Reference-contexts: However, in many cases accuracies in the order of significant fractions of a second are acceptable. In such cases, simpler protocols such as the Time Protocol <ref> [12] </ref>, have been used for this purpose. These protocols usually involve an RPC exchange where the client requests the time of day and the server returns it in seconds past some known reference epoch.
