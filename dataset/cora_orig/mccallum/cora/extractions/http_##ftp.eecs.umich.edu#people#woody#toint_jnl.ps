Abstract: Consider a linear feedback system for which the plant has a single input and two outputs. Suppose that the direction of the plant (i.e., the ratio of the plant transfer function) changes significantly with frequency. We show that such plants are subject to inherent design limitations that become important if the change in direction occurs over the desired closed loop bandwidth. These limitations are derived by applying the Middleton and Poisson integrals to elements of the output sensitivity function.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The theory of inherent design limitations for Single Input, Single Output (SISO) linear time-invariant feedback systems is well established. Recent years have seen this theory extended to sampled-data, nonlinear, and Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) feedback systems. The original work in this area is due to Bode <ref> [1] </ref>. A comprehensive survey of recent results and extensions is found in [12], which contains a complete set of references. A theme throughout the theory of inherent design limitations is that the quality of a feedback design may be described using the sensitivity function associated with the system.

Reference-contexts: Despite much progress, design limitations for MIMO feedback systems are less well-understood than are their counterparts for SISO systems. For example, one class of results is phrased in terms of integral relations that must be satisfied by the singular values of the sensitivity matrix (e.g., [3], <ref> [2] </ref>). These relations have drawbacks in that it may be difficult to relate singular values to properties of the underlying system and that the results obtained may be conservative.

This is a Two Input, Two Output (TITO) feedback design problem with an interesting feature in that one of the control actuators strongly affects both controlled outputs; bandwidth limitations implied that the other actuator had authority only at DC.

Reference-contexts: It is well established that a NMP zero in L I (s) implies an upper limit on the practically achievable value of ! S . Increasing the value of ! S beyond this achievable value will result in large values of kS I k 1 <ref> [6] </ref>, and the closed loop system response will be poor. 5 6 Plant Direction vs Frequency In this section we introduce a coordinate system that describes how the plant direction varies with frequency. <p> Suppose that jS O22 (j!)j &lt; ff &lt; 1; 8! ! 0 ; (9.6) where ! 0 is the performance bandwidth. Then jS O22 (j!)j must have a peak at some higher frequency. As discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>, the location of the NMP zero limits the achievable performance bandwidth; in particular, ! 0 cannot extend into the frequency range for which the NMP zero contributes significant phase lag. fl Remark 9.6 (Limitations Due to the Bode Sensitivity Integral) Assume that L 2j1 (s) has at least two zeros <p> Suppose that this peak is unacceptable and that (9.7) is viewed as a hard constraint. Then, as discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>, we must relax the the performance specification by requiring less sensitivity reduction (larger ff) and/or a lower performance bandwidth (smaller ! 0 ). fl Remark 9.7 (Limitations Due to Zero DC Gain) It was shown on pp. 429-430 of [11] that the com-plementary sensitivity function of a SISO feedback system

Reference-contexts: In [5] the authors showed that a decentralized control architecture imposed design tradeoffs for this problem; the reason for the superior performance of the multivariable controller remained a matter of conjecture. To address this question, the authors of <ref> [8] </ref> noted that the RIE could be viewed as a Single Input, Single Output (SITO) plant for the purpose of controlling transients. Using concepts of plant and controller direction, they argued that a multivariable controller can achieve better plant/controller alignment than can a decentralized controller.

Using concepts of plant and controller direction, they argued that a multivariable controller can achieve better plant/controller alignment than can a decentralized controller. The analysis in [8] described so-called "algebraic" tradeoffs between system properties at a fixed frequency. Other design tradeoffs must occur between system properties in different frequency ranges. These are termed "analytic" tradeoffs; examples of such tradeoffs are those described by the Bode sensitivity integral and gain-phase relation. <p> The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 contains notation and preliminary remarks. In Section 3 we review the concepts of plant and controller direction and plant/controller alignment that were used in <ref> [8] </ref>. These concepts are used in Section 4 to describe the algebraic tradeoff between different outputs of a SITO system, and to quantify that tradeoff using the plant/controller alignment angle. These results suggest that the alignment angle should be kept small within the closed loop bandwidth. <p> The following definitions are taken from <ref> [8] </ref>. Definition 3.1 (Direction and Alignment Angle) Identify the directions of the plant and controller at frequency ! with R (P (j!)) and R row (C (j!)), respectively 1 . <p> Definition 3.2 (Gain and Phase Ratios) Define the gain and phase ratios for the plant by fi fi p 1 (j!) fi " p 2 (j!) j and for the controller by fi fi c 1 (j!) fi i c 1 (j!) . fl As discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>, the alignment angle is a measure of how closely the direction of the controller matches that of the plant. The following extreme cases are of particular interest. Definition 3.3 (Perfect Alignment and Complete Misalignment) (i).

Indeed, feedback properties are insensitive to moderate deviations from perfect alignment, and alignment is not critical at frequencies above the closed loop bandwidth (Remark 4.3).
