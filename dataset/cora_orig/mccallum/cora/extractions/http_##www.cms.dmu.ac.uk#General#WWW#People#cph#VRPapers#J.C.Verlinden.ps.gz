Reference-contexts: An excellent introduction into this field is given in Howard Rheingold s book Virtual Reality (Rheingold 1990); a scientific introduction can be found in Brook s concise overview article <ref> (Brooks 1988) </ref> that is still up to date. W e must be aware that Virtual Reality is more than a hype: an increasing number of research projects is currently focusing on serious applications of Virtual Reality. Some of them are presented in the next section. <p> Finally , the PARC visualizations only cover hierarchical and linear information collections, whereas the world processor can contain complete hypertextual networks, that may contain hierarchic groups (often called webs). The prototypes served both as graphics for insight as well as graphics for publication <ref> (Brooks 1988, p. 9) </ref>. We gained some publicity through our papers, talks, and prototypes. During GVU demo days and guided tours the virtual books were presented to a lar ge number of visitors. Among the Interactive Construction Visualizer (Rodriquez 1993), they were part of the standard VR-demos.

Reference-contexts: The samples of the microscope are presented to the user as forces, giving the illusion that the user is scratching along a microscopic surface. *The UNC group also developed advanced architectural walkthroughs that employ exotic input devices like a bicycle and a treadmill <ref> (Brooks et al. 1992) </ref>. Finally, at the Industrial Design department of the Delft University of Technology Virtual Reality is primarily used as a tool to conduct experiments on perception. This group favors a specific approach towards perception, often referred to as the ecological approach, founded by J.J. <p> Apart from the pages, each room has a sign (an icon) on the entrance, while a small octahedron in the middle of the environment displays a static map of the environment. An overview map helps to maintain orientation <ref> (Brooks 1992) </ref>. The T extured book uses the following concepts: 3.4.3 Voice Annotation System. This example demonstrates the other design method of V irtual Books: textualizing space. As already said, existing Virtual Reality applications do not of fer facilities to communicate or to embed messages.

Reference-contexts: One can not hope to equal the speed and f lexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage <ref> (Bush 1945) </ref> In that year Bush proposed a system to mechanize the huge collection of scientif ic literature. Key feature of this system called Memex would be the links between documents.

Reference-contexts: The existing communication infrastructure fails to statisfy the demand. World-wide initiatives are taking place to create fast high bandwidth networks. For example, the Gigabit project in Sweden focuses on developing a network that will have 10 to 100 times as much capabilities as the ISDN standard <ref> (Carlson and Fahlen 1993) </ref>. These new improvements in computer technology seem only to affect a small community who can afford the initial expenses of buying and learning (typically universities).

Reference-contexts: Douglas Engelbart was the first to employ computers for nonlinear documents instead of a mechanized technology. In 1963 he writes A Conceptual Framework for the Augmentation of Mans Intellect. In his vision, computers were perfectly suited for quick branching and exi-ble manipulation of documents <ref> (Engelbart 1963) </ref>. Much like Bush s Memex project, his research was focused on creating a framework of tools that would augment scientif ic research and thinking. Support for non-lineair (associative) reading and writing was considered to be crucial.

Reference-contexts: SemNet Spatial representation has also been applied to the representation of verbal ideas and text itself. A pioneering application in this area was the SemNet system in 1986 <ref> (Fairchild et al. 88) </ref>. SemNet displayed semantic networks in three dimensions. Like the proposed USENET news interface, the semantic network appeared as clusters of cubes and lines that were deployed in a virtual space.

Reference-contexts: However, there is a long historical tradition of labeling and writing on objects in the world. Clay vessels, stone tablets, the walls and doors of buildings, metal road signs, and so on have all served as spaces for writing <ref> (Gaur 1992) </ref>. There is also a long tradition of locating semantic objects in an imagined space.

Reference-contexts: However, in my opinion, the concepts that one encounters and uses in virtual environments are often closely related to the ones that we f ind in real world. In the Ecological Approach to Visual Perception James J. Gibson presents useful concepts that are perceivable in the real world <ref> (Gibson 1979) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The biggest advantage of immersive setups is the complete control on the interaction and perception, and it offers the ability to look around 360 degrees. More aspects and dif ferences of these systems are well documented in Hentschels USENET news posting <ref> (Hentschel 1991) </ref>. The images presented to the user are perspective projections generated by fast computer graphics workstations. Even with expensive systems virtual environments look extremely simple, often cartoon-like. Generally speaking, the images have to be updated by at least 10 to 30 times a second to engage the user .

Reference-contexts: All of these systems focus on the display and exploration of large information spaces. They would be classed as exploratory hy-pertexts, while in constructive hypertext, the user or reader can modify both structure and text <ref> (Joyce 1988) </ref>. 2.3.3 Requirements and Constraints As already said in the f irst chapter, the objective of the Virtual Books project is the development and evaluation of several prototypes that highlight specific aspects for creating and reading Virtual Books.

Reference-contexts: The event-callback mechanism can be used as a basis for more sophisticated user interface control mechanisms, e.g. Rule-based layered UIMSs <ref> (Lewis et al. 1991) </ref>. Most interaction techniques are shared among a wide variety of virtual environments. For example, the navigation technique with the mouse (described above) is included in almost all of the applications.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, slow speeds tend to irritate the user. This problem can be minimized by limiting the navigable space, for example by constructing boundary volumes. Another solution is the inclusion of a so called Point-Of-Interest navigation technique, described in <ref> (Macinlay et al. 1990) </ref>. This technique facilitates a goal-oriented navigation, in which the velocity logarithmically depends on the distance to a specif ic object in space.

Reference-contexts: Several new visualization tools and interface techniques have been introduced in this project. So-called cone trees and cam trees display hierarchical information,e.g. a directory structure (Robertson et al. 1991); temporal or other linear information can be visualized with the perspective wall, a three dimensional timeline <ref> (Macinlay et al. 1991) </ref>. The objective of the 3D/Rooms project is to augment information processing, in particular retrieval and browsing activities. Their visualizations should reduce the information overload.

Reference-contexts: New schemes could evolve that allow people to act and think more ef ficiently and in a different way. David Marr illustrated this ef fect, that representation schemes can have on thinking, by comparing arabic and roman representations of numbers <ref> (Marr 1982) </ref>. The number 44 is represented by XLIV in roman, which obviously makes it a lot harder to multiply or divide. However , electronic media will not replace the traditional ones.

Reference-contexts: Instead of focusing on a user interface, he was interested in the cultural and social implications of storing the entire worlds literary corpus in one global database <ref> (Nelson 1967) </ref>. This database would Virtual Books 18 support referential integrity by simply pointing to the referred sources instead of coping its contents. The system he proposed was called Xanadu (the magic place of literary memory from Samuel Taylor Coleridges poem Kubla Khan).

Reference-contexts: When the number of nodes and the structure are suf ficient, the writer starts to fill the nodes with text. Of course, these activities do not take place in sequence but iterative. As a matter of fact, Neuwirth and Kaufer stress the imporance of a highly f lexible interface <ref> (Neuwirth and Kaufer 1993) </ref>. Hypertext systems provide support to write papers. Yet these activities are still focused on producing printed matter, the final result is a linearized document.

Reference-contexts: Although this library may seem to be straightforward it took a more than a month to debug it (basically due to the bad manual of the tracker system). At present, this library is successfully incorporated within the SVE library and also in the interactive construction visualizer <ref> (opdenBosch 1993) </ref>(Rodriquez 1992) and the 3D polka algorithm visualization library (Stasko and W ehrli 1992).

Reference-contexts: PARC 3D/Rooms The Xerox PARC project called 3D/Rooms has extended this concept of spatialization to information visualization in general (Card et al. 1991). Several new visualization tools and interface techniques have been introduced in this project. So-called cone trees and cam trees display hierarchical information,e.g. a directory structure <ref> (Robertson et al. 1991) </ref>; temporal or other linear information can be visualized with the perspective wall, a three dimensional timeline (Macinlay et al. 1991). The objective of the 3D/Rooms project is to augment information processing, in particular retrieval and browsing activities. Their visualizations should reduce the information overload. <p> Instead of moving the user from one place to another, browsing functions could rearrange and change the structure of the document by highlighting occurrence, hiding non-relevant clusters, and so on The PARC system includes gardening tools to prune or grow its cone trees <ref> (Robertson et al. 1991, page 5) </ref>. When multiple users have access to the same structure, however, such rearranging can cause confusion, unless some sort of protocol is established for distinguishing between private views and public space.

Reference-contexts: Rather than having to track down little-known proceedings, journals or unpublished technical reports from distant universities, users will find them stored in one large distributed computerized national paper network. New papers will be written using the network, often collaborated on by multiple authors, and submitted to on-line electronic journals. <ref> (Trigg 1983) </ref> Despite the progress in computer technology since the f ifties the paperless office still does not exist. On the contrary, the introduction of computers seemed to result in an enormously in Virtual Books 16 creased use of paper 1 . <p> This is not true: links do not only serve to support non-linear writing and reading, they are the elements that constitute the context, the structure of the information. Many different types of links exist, Randall Trigg describes over 80 kinds <ref> (Trigg 83) </ref>. For example, nodes can be connected by special refutation or conformation links (as figure 4 (IBIS) already showed). Links can have dynamic properties.

Reference-contexts: Virtual Reality research is mainly presented at SIGGRAPH and CHI conferences, although other (computer related) conferences also tend to include this subject. V irtual Reality is rapidly infiltrating in many seemingly unrelated domains. Two dimensional interfaces are suddenly made in a three-dimensional style <ref> (Veliola 1993) </ref>. 2.2.3 Problems with current Virtual Reality systems. Of course, Virtual Reality technology is just in its first stage. It will take years of research and development before full immersive VR sets are commercially available for other domains than recreation. <p> Research continues on the use of two-dimensional input devices such as the mouse to manipulate objects in 3D environments (Houde 1992)(Mackinlay 1990). At InterCHI 1993, Apple presented a new mouse with three degrees of freedom <ref> (Veliola 1993) </ref>; the mouse rests at table while the third dimension is controlled by a thumbwheel. Such devices will facilitate future interfaces to interact with three-dimensional structures. One could even ask whether the V irtual Book needs accurate three dimensional perspective views.

Reference-contexts: Orators in ancient Greece and Rome used spatialization to memorize speeches by a technique called the art of memory: they remembered each speech as an imaginary walk through a three dimensional structure, usually a building or a garden <ref> (Yates 1966) </ref>. Computer graphics, especially three dimensional graphics and Virtual Reality, provide contemporary technology that can vastly extend the art of memory and help the users imagine symbols or semantic objects in space. Second, Virtual Reality applications could be enhanced by including hypertext systems.
