Abstract: Current state of the art in image retrieval and indexing doesn't meet all the needs of users of electronic picture collections. Content based retrieval provides little support for semantic metadata, in particular descriptions of what the image contains or represents. We present the approach being taken by the STARCH project, which is using a Description Logic (DL) for semantic metadata. The structured representation of the DL can assist in providing more powerful environments for retrieval, through the support of browsing, navigation and the serendipitous discovery of information. The conceptual space can also prove useful for defining notions of similarity and semantic closeness. We illustrate these claims with a series of examples taken from our prototype system. Museums and other cultural organisations increasingly make use of electronic resources in the form of on-line public catalogues, on-line databases and CDROMS. This move to electronic management of archives is reflected by the emergence of Digital Libraries. Digital picture archives use metadata to provide flexible descriptions of the images within them in order to index and consequently retrieve those images. Metadata standards such as the Dublin Core

Reference-contexts: Compositional concept descriptions can then be built up using recursive term constructors, where terms are concepts or roles. Individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular concepts and pairs of individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular roles. Using the basic concrete syntax from <ref> (Baader et al., 1991) </ref>, we can define a small piece of model as shown in Table 1.1. We can now construct compositions of these primitive concepts, for example the concept of a person holding a cup: (and Person (some holding Cup)). <p> Construction of DL expressions is further discussed in Section 1.3.

Reference-contexts: For users who need retrieval based on abstract notions, such as freedom or joy <ref> (Bjarnestam, 1998) </ref>, this semantic metadata is essential. Representing the Semantic Metadata There are a variety of solutions to the problem of representing metadata. Free text has the advantage of flexibility and expressiveness in terms of the information that can be represented.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a DL supports hierarchical classification through the use of a well-defined notion of subsumption. For a full description of DLs and their uses, see <ref> (Borgida, 1995) </ref>. A DL models an application domain in terms of concepts (classes), roles (relations) and individuals (objects). The domain is a set of individuals, and a concept is a description of a group of individuals that share common characteristics. <p> Construction of DL expressions is further discussed in Section 1.3. Reasoning Services DLs provide a variety of services (Baader et al., 1991) that make them particularly attractive as models for describing semi-structured and complex information <ref> (Borgida, 1995) </ref>. Subsumption. The power of DLs is derived from the automatic determination of subsumption between compositional descriptions. Given two conceptual definitions A and B, we can determine whether A subsumes B, in other words whether every instance of B is necessarily an instance of A.

Reference-contexts: Certain kinds of controlled vocabularies, known as coding schemes are a collection of terms arranged in a hierarchy that is usually intended to represent the "subsumption" or specialisation/generalisation relation, for example Iconclass (Waal, 1985) and SHIC (SHIC Working Party, 1983). The classification forms a semantic index space <ref> (Bruza, 1990) </ref> which can be used to cluster pictures associated with concepts in the same class. Querying the picture's content descriptor retrieves those that are conceptually similar according to some specification of what is meant by similarity. <p> Concept-based linking and similarity Conceptual hypermedia systems complement conventional static linking with links generated through the used of a conceptual domain model of the contents of the hypermedia nodes; the concept model acts as a hyperindex <ref> (Bruza, 1990) </ref> to the nodes. Links and concept-based queries are considered to be synonymous. TourisT (Bullock and Goble, 1998) supports similarity-based linking through a DL-based ontology; we plan to incorporate STARCH into an Open Hypermedia System as a link resolution service.

(Kheirbek and Chiaramella, 1995) employ conceptual graphs to unify structural knowledge about documents and link semantics, and use this to underlie a unified querying and browsing interaction model.

Reference-contexts: Metadata standards such as the Dublin Core 1 2 (Cathro, 1997) are concerned largely with devising minimum and uniform data sets of cataloguing information, for example, the author, title, and date of acquisition. Other metadata represents content based information which can be classified at various levels <ref> (Eakins, 1996) </ref>: 1. syntactic information, concerned with the primitive image features, e.g. colour or texture; 2. descriptions of objects of a particular type, corresponding to Panofsky's (Panofsky, 1974) pre-iconographic level of picture description e.g. pictures of a train crossing a bridge or of Nelson's column in the sunshine; 3. descriptions of

Reference-contexts: Requests can range from the highly specific find Van Gogh's Sunflowers to the vague and indicative find a picture of a stately home. Enser <ref> (Enser, 1995) </ref> characterises requests made to image collections according to two orthogonal notions: 4 Unique vs. non-unique e.g. Prince Charles as opposed to Royal; Refined vs. un-refined e.g. Prince Charles holding Trophy as opposed to Prince Charles.

Reference-contexts: English folk dancing), or concepts of emotional or symbolic significance (e.g. "happy" pictures). Subdivisions correspond roughly with the ideas of iconography and iconology. Retrieval on the basis of syntactic metadata is frequently referred to as Content Based Retrieval (CBR), exemplified by systems such as QBIC <ref> (Flickner et al., 1995) </ref>. Although CBR has attracted considerable research interest, the images are not assigned any sense of meaning, limiting their use when indexing and retrieving on the conceptual, abstract or icongraphical information in levels 2 and 3; such activities need human indexers.

Reference-contexts: The major issues are outlined below. The Ontology Crucial to our approach is the provision of an ontology the collection of basic concepts and relationships that are being used to represent the domain. The construction of such an ontology is a non-trivial task. Experiences in the Tambis <ref> (Goble et al., 1998) </ref> and GALEN (Rector et al., 1996) projects suggest large ontologies of thousands of concepts require several man-years to produce.

Reference-contexts: This is especially important as no description could ever be complete and hence needs to be extended.

The Art Museum project <ref> (Kato, 1992) </ref> attempts to derive relationships between colour histograms of pictures with terms such as "charming", "romantic", "wild" through the use of a training set. Commercial providers of visual content, such as CORBIS and Getty Images, use large keyword or term collections to index collections.

Reference-contexts: Another common approach is to encode semantic metadata in some type structure. Examples include (Niu et al., 1997) where salient objects (interesting objects that appear in images) are modelled and classified using an object-oriented framework. Although OO systems provide many suitable features for multimedia database systems <ref> (Klas et al., 1990) </ref>, Oomoto and Tanaka (Oomoto and Tanaka, 1993) in particular make the criticism that OODB type systems are generally static and do not support schema evolution well.

Reference-contexts: DL expressions can be added CLASSIFICATION BASED NAVIGATION AND RETRIEVAL 15 to or refined anytime, effectively re-typing the document.

Reference-contexts: We use a Description Logic (DL) of limited expressivity to represent the terminology, harnessing the expressive and powerful classification reasoning powers of this technology. Our work differs from <ref> (Meghini et al., 1997) </ref> in that we do not extend the DL with extra reasoning power and expressivity. In addition we concentrate simply on content without attempting to incorporate reasoning about the syntactic structure of images. <p> DLs have been used in the field of Information Retrieval to describe and classify documents. (Kheirbek and Chiaramella, 1995) employ conceptual graphs to unify structural knowledge about documents and link semantics, and use this to underlie a unified querying and browsing interaction model. Meghini <ref> (Meghini et al., 1997) </ref> adopts a DL for information retrieval. Their work differs from ours in that they intend modelling both form (syntactic metadata) and content (semantic metadata) using one unified system. There is little focus on interaction with the metadata representation or how queries might be constructed.

Reference-contexts: Many authors (Nanard and Nanard, 1993; Bruza, 1990) refer to the use of semantic networks or term classification systems to underlie hypertext linking or to support the typing of documents and links <ref> (Nanard and Nanard, 1993) </ref>.

In a similar way <ref> (Nanard and Nanard, 1993) </ref>, supplement their semantic network (k-level), with a task model, using scripts to control complex task-oriented link generation. Hence the notion of similarity-based linking is extended across the subsumption relationship to other relationships.

Reference-contexts: To overcome these problems, we must investigate a model of similarity that is based on subsumption. The basic premise is that two terms are similar if they share a number of parents in the concept hierarchy. This fits with the ideas of similarity described in <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>, where metrics are defined based on common and distinguishing features. Shared parents encapsulate the notion of a shared feature, while a parent that is not shared indicates a distinguishing feature. <p> Thus 14 N ormSim V;W (X; Y ) = Sim V;W (X; Y ) An interesting effect of the normalisation is that the measure is no longer symmetric. However, as discussed in <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>, similarity is not necessarily a symmetric relation. In our example, we have provided views specifying that the interesting characteristics of the descriptions (in decreasing order of importance) include: what they are holding; what they are wearing; their status; and their sex.

Reference-contexts: Certain kinds of controlled vocabularies, known as coding schemes are a collection of terms arranged in a hierarchy that is usually intended to represent the "subsumption" or specialisation/generalisation relation, for example Iconclass <ref> (Waal, 1985) </ref> and SHIC (SHIC Working Party, 1983). The classification forms a semantic index space (Bruza, 1990) which can be used to cluster pictures associated with concepts in the same class.
