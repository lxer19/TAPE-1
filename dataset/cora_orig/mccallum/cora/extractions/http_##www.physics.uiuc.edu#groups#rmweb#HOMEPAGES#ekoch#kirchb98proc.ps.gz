Abstract: For conventional superconductors the electron-electron interaction is strongly reduced by retardation effects, making the formation of Cooper pairs possible. In the alkali-doped Fullerides, however, there are no strong retardation effects. But dielectric screening can reduce the electron-electron interaction sufficiently, if we assume that the random-phase approximation (RPA) is valid. It is not clear, however, if this assumption holds, since the alkali-doped Fullerides are strongly correlated systems close to a Mott transition. To test the validity of the RPA for these systems we have calculated the screening of a test charge using quantum Monte Carlo.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION In order to lead to an effective attraction between electrons, the electron-phonon interaction has to overcome the strong electron-electron repulsion. For conventional superconductors retardation effects strongly reduce the Coulomb repulsion <ref> [1] </ref>. The resulting effective interaction is described by the dimensionless Coulomb pseudopo-tential fl . In the above sense, the alkali-doped Fullerides are non-conventional superconductors, since for them retardation effects are very inefficient in reducing the Coulomb repulsion [2].

Reference-contexts: We determine the ground state properties of the Hamiltonians H 0 and H 0 + H 1 (for finite fcc clusters) using diffusion Monte Carlo with the fixed-node approximation <ref> [6] </ref>. In this method we construct a trial wave function j T i and allow it to diffuse towards the exact (within the fixed node approximation) solution j 0 i.

Reference-contexts: For weakly interacting systems (U=W small) the screening is very good, while it breaks down completely for large U=W , where the system is a Mott insulator. RPA somewhat underestimates the screening for U=W &lt; ~ 1:0 <ref> [7] </ref>. For intermediate values of U=W it works surprisingly well and actually remains rather accurate almost all the way up to the Mott transition. Beyond this point RPA becomes qualitatively wrong. The failure of the RPA in the strongly interaction regime can be easily understood.

Reference-contexts: At normal pressure this system is an insulator. Under pressure it becomes superconducting, with T c increasing with pressure <ref> [8] </ref>. This is in contrast to the other alkali-doped Fullerides, where T c drops with pressure. As pressure is applied to the Mott insulator, U=W decreases and the screening becomes more and more efficient, reducing the effective Coulomb interaction fl , i.e. increasing T c .
