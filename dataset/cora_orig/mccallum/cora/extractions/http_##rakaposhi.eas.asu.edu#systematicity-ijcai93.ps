Abstract: Recent work on foundations of partial-order planning has emphasized the importance of systematicity and elimination of redundancy in search space as a way to improve planning performance. In this paper, we investigate the utility of systematicity. Starting with a a rational reconstruction of the motivations for systematicity, we will conclude that it eliminates redundancy in the search space at the expense of increased commitment during planning. This increase in commitment leads to higher backtracking and increased solution depth, both of which can adversely affect the performance of the planner. We will argue that the performance of a planner is correlated more closely with the way it balances the tradeoff between redundancy and commitment, than with the systematicity of its search. We will discuss a spectrum of solutions for dealing with the redundancy-commitment tradeoff and show that systematic planners are at one extreme of this spectrum, with total least commitment planners like TWEAK on the other extreme. Based on empirical studies with seven planners that fall at different points in this spectrum, we will demonstrate that more efficient planners lie in the middle rather than at the extremes of this spectrum. We also identify characteristics of planners and problems that are predictive of planning performance.

Reference-contexts: So, we are left with the option of building systematicity into the planning algorithm. Search Space redundancyin TWEAK: Chapman's <ref> [1] </ref> modal truth criterion specifies a superset of plan refinement operations used by most partial-order planners using STRIPS action representation. TWEAK, a planner achieved by inverting this truth criterion, turns out to have a lot of redundancy in its search space. <p> Causal links with these semantics are called exhaustive causal links (c.f. [4]). To make an exhaustive causal link fsg p ! w safe, every threat must either be promoted to come after w or be demoted to come before s. (Notice that white-knight declobbering <ref> [1] </ref> is inconsistent with the semantics of an exhaustive causal link). Systematicity of SNLP: McAllester described a planner based on the idea of exhaustive causal links (which later became known as 3 Planners using causal links do not eliminate looping; they merely reduce it.

Reference-contexts: This, in turn implies that SNLP which folds threat resolution into link establishment, and thus searches in the space of safe partial orderings, will be systematic. 5 Other conflicting notions of Systematicity: There have been several conflicting interpretations of ``systematicity'' of partial-order planning in the literature. Some researchers (c.f. <ref> [2] </ref>) have interpreted McAllester's systematicity claim to mean that even though the same operator sequence may appear in more than one branch, it will never have the same causal structure.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the planner never considers the same potential solution (ground operator sequence) more than once. The systematicity claim of SNLP, stated above, can be proved rigorously by adapting the proofs of Harvey et. al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Harvey shows that given any two complete plans in the search space of SNLP, the sets of operator sequences defined by the topological sorts of these plans will be disjoint. Harvey's proof only utilizes the safeness of plans, rather than their completeness. <p> This is reasonable because step names and causal links are artifacts of the particular planning strategy, while systematicity should be defined with respect to the space of potential solutions (Figure 1). Another weaker notion of irredundancy, that we term solution-systematicity has also been used by some researchers (c.f. <ref> [3] </ref>). A planner is solution-systematic as long as it never generates the same solution (i.e, operator sequence which is a correct plan for the problem) more than once. 6 It can be shown (c.f. [3]) that regardless of the order in which threat resolution and link-establishment is done (i.e., even if <p> weaker notion of irredundancy, that we term solution-systematicity has also been used by some researchers (c.f. <ref> [3] </ref>).

[3]) that regardless of the order in which threat resolution and link-establishment is done (i.e., even if we don't fold the former into the latter), SNLP will have solution-systematicity. Solution systematicity does not in general imply systematicity.

Reference-contexts: This was largely motivated by the belief that redundancy reduction will lead to improvements in planning efficiency [9, 8]. One approach towards redundancy elimination, that turned out to be particularly influential (as evidenced by several closely related extensions <ref> [8, 13, 4, 12] </ref>), was that of McAllester's [8]. McAllester showed that it is possible to design a PO planner that is systematic in the strong sense that it never visits two equivalent plans or plans having overlapping linearizations (see Section 2.). <p> Specifically, v is considered a -ve threat if it deletes p and a +ve threat if it adds p. Causal links with these semantics are called exhaustive causal links (c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>). To make an exhaustive causal link fsg p ! w safe, every threat must either be promoted to come after w or be demoted to come before s. (Notice that white-knight declobbering [1] is inconsistent with the semantics of an exhaustive causal link). <p> A causal link S p of a plan P is said to be exhaustive (c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>), if for every ground linearization of P, some step s 0 2 S will be the last step preceding w that gives p in that linearization. <p> In both planners, a threat v to a causal link fsg p ! w is resolved by ordering it to come either before s or after w. The other two planners, MP and MP-I , use multi-contributor causal links <ref> [4] </ref> to guide planning. MP maintains exhaustive causal links. In MP , a threat v to a link S p ! w is resolved by either promoting v to come after w or demoting v to come before some step s 2 S (a choice point).
