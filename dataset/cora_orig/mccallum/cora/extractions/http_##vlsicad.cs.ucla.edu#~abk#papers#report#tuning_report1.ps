Abstract: Interconnect tuning is an increasingly critical degree of freedom in the design of high-performance VLSI systems. By interconnect tuning, we refer to the selection by a design team of line thicknesses, widths and spacings in multi-layer interconnect to simultaneously achieve: (i) distribution (available wiring density) for local signals, global signals, clock, power and ground; (ii) performance (signal propagation delay), particularly on global interconnects; (iii) noise immunity (signal integrity), again particularly on global interconnects; and (iv) manufacturability and reliability (e.g., required margins for AC self-heat or DC electromigration on interconnects, short-circuit power in attached devices, etc.). While interconnect tuning is a key activity in most leading-edge microprocessor projects, it has received very little attention in the literature. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first technology-specific studies of interconnect tuning in the literature. We center on global wiring layers (e.g., M4 and M5 in a 6LM process), and interconnect tuning issues related to bus routing, repeater insertion, and choice of shielding/spacing rules for signal integrity and performance. (Of necessity, our study is independent of a number of alternate issues, e.g., wire tapering.) After presenting background material and a survey of interconnect tuning issues, we address four basic questions. (1) How should width and spacing be allocated to maximize performance for a given line pitch? (2) For a given line pitch, what criteria affect the optimal interval at which repeaters should be inserted into global interconnects? (3) Under what circumstances are shield wires the optimum technique for improving interconnect performance? (4) In global interconnect with repeaters, what other interconnect tuning is possible? We answer these questions using technology parameters appropriate to M3 and M4 of a 5-layer 0.25um CMOS process. Of particular interest is our study of question (4): we demonstrate that a new approach that offsets repeater placements can reduce worst-case cross-chip delays by over 30% in current technologies, versus traditional repeater insertion methodology.

Reference-contexts: When lateral coupling capacitances are large, worst-case "Miller coupling" begins to dominate noise and delay calculations; 3 this is alleviated by increasing the line spacing and/or adding shield wiring (i.e., wires connected to ground), with future techniques possibly including dedicated ground and power planes interleaved with signal layers <ref> [4] </ref>. The bus-dominated nature of global interconnects in building-block and high-performance designs only worsens the effects of coupling, since it causes longer parallel runs. 4 * All layers are subject to mutual pitch-matching, via sizing, etc. considerations. <p> capacitance.

Reference-contexts: Bottom M2 is a ground plane; top M4 is populated by crossover lines. We have performed detailed studies of "fast" M3 interconnect with 3.2m pitch, assuming that M2 crossunders are dense (i.e., can be approximated as a ground plane) <ref> [7] </ref> and explicitly modeling 5 M4 crossovers. Dielectric modeling is based on actual layer data for a representative 0.25m CMOS process. The commercial QuickCap tool from Random Logic Corporation was used to perform extraction of coupling and area capacitances, as shown in Table 2.

Reference-contexts: Example considerations for a 7-layer metal (7LM) process 1 might include: * Local interconnect layers (e.g., M1-M3) should generally remain at near-minimum dimensions and pitch in order to achieve routing density (for an example analysis of interconnect density in forthcoming 0.25m processes, again see <ref> [8] </ref>). For short lines (e.g., several hundred microns or less), thinner metal offers less lateral coupling capacitance and driver loading, and thus locally improves circuit performance. At the same time, maximum wire width is limited by the aspect ratio upper bound. <p> designs; since shorter wires are better routed on thinner metal, these design-specific considerations will affect the interconnect. * Power distribution layers (e.g., M6-M7, maybe M5), which typically also support the top-level clock distribution (mesh or balanced-tree), should be as thick as possible for reliability. 2 IR 1 As reported in <ref> [8] </ref>, many companies will be on-line with 0.25m processes in 1997, with Digital's CMOS-7 and IBM's CMOS-6X being two examples of 6LM processes. 2 DC electromigration and AC heating limits are typically given in terms of the ratio of current to line cross-section. 2 drop and clock skew as well as <p> Today, interconnect tuning is a key activity in most leading-edge microprocessor projects. It is clearly an option whenever the design and fabrication are owned by a single entity; however, for high-volume projects even fabless design houses are exercising increasing influence on vendors' processes <ref> [8] </ref>. Nevertheless, this topic has received very little attention in the literature, with only a small handful of high-level treatments available. 5 This work provides, to our knowledge, the first studies of interconnect tuning in the literature.
