Abstract: This paper considers the congestion control scheme for the SS7 signaling network in the GSM digital cellular network. This congestion control scheme is based on monitoring the SS7 link buffer occupancy. In this scheme, a congestion onset message is sent to the user parts of the SS7 network when the buffer occupancy exceeds a certain threshold and then subsequently a congestion abatement message is sent when the buffer occupancy goes below another threshold. Upon receipt of the congestion onset message, the user parts are expected to "intelligently" throttle the user traffic (reduce the traffic rate) so as to yield speedy recovery from congestion. Subsequently, on receipt of the abatement message the user traffic is restored to pre-congestion levels. This paper primarily proposes appropriate choice of throttles and an algorithmic procedure to size the thresholds so as to yield good performance during congestion. The paper also addresses some implementation issues related to the throttles and also briefly considers the effects of possible delays for the onset and abatement messages in reaching the user parts on performance and the parameters of the congestion control scheme.

The CCITT specification of the SS7 protocol <ref> [MS92] </ref> includes a congestion control protocol which is based on link buffer occupancy thresholds. When the buffer occupancy at the outgoing link of some network node exceeds a certain threshold, referred to as the onset threshold, a congestion onset message is sent to the user parts of the SS7 network.

Reference-contexts: Our goal in this paper is then to determine values of the thresholds and the throttles so as to obtain good performance during congestion. The computation of thresholds for the SS7 congestion control scheme has been considered previously <ref> [LL89, Sko88] </ref>. The work of [LL89] considers the international option of the congestion control scheme and proposes guidelines to size the thresholds and a timer associated with the abatement scheme. <p> We will see that in fact this is necessary in order to permit differential treatment of the user parts during congestion with the international option. Finally, we present a algorithmic procedure for the computation of thresholds and throttles rather than mere guidelines. The work of <ref> [Sko88] </ref> considers the national option with message priorities and heterogenous streams. However, the focus of the work is more on transient behaviour of the congestion control scheme rather than the steady-state behaviour considered in this paper which is more representative of the 1 interesting case of sustained congestion conditions.
