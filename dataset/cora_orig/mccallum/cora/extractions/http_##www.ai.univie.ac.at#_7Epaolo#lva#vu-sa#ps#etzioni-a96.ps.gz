Abstract: and regurgitate them as searchable indices. Today, most Web users feed near the bottom of the information food chain, but the time is ripe to move up. Since 1991, we have been building information carnivores, which intelligently hunt and feast on herbivores in Unix (Etzioni, Lesh, & Segal 1993), on the Internet (Etzioni & Weld 1994), and on the Web (Dooren-bos, Etzioni, & Weld 1996; Selberg & Etzioni 1995; Shakes, Langheinrich, & Etzioni 1996). ple, an information cow such as Alta Vista. Alta Vista requires massive memory resources (to store an index of the Web) and tremendous network bandwidth (to create and continually refresh the index). The cost of these resources is amortized over millions of queries per day. As a result, the CPU cycles devoted to satisfying each individual query are sharply curtailed. There is no time for intelligence. Furthermore, each query is independent of the previous one. No attempt is made to customize Alta Vista's responses to a particular individual. The result is homogenized, least-common-denominator service. Nicholas Negroponte have been advocating agents | personal assistants that act on your behalf in cyberspace. While the notion of agents has been popular for more than a decade, we have yet to build agents that are both widely used and intelligent. The Web presents a golden opportunity and an implicit challenge for the AI community. As the old adage goes "If not us, then who? And if not now, when?" Is the Web challenge a distraction from our long-term goal of understanding intelligence and building intelligent agents? I believe that the field benefits from a mixture of long-term and short-term goals and from both empirical and theoretical work. Work toward the goal of deploying intelligent agents on the Web is a valuable addition to the current mix for two reasons. First, the Web suggests new problems and new constraints on existing techniques. Second, intelligent Web agents will provide tangible evidence of the power and utility of AI techniques. Next time you encounter AI bashing, wouldn't it be satisfying to counter with a few well-chosen URLs? Personally, I find the Web irresistible. To borrow Herb Simon's phrase, it is today's "Main Chance." Simon describes his move from the "academic backwater" of public administration to AI
