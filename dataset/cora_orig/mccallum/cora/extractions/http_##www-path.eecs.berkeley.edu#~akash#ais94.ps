Abstract: SmartDB is a framework for the uniform specification, simulation, optimization, evaluation, and implementation of Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS) alternatives. The salient concepts in SmartDB are: 1) layered control architecture, 2) coordination of distributed control agents through communication, 3) combined discrete and continuous dynamical systems, known as hybrid systems, and their control and verification, 4) object oriented simulation, and 5) distributed and open architecture. This paper summarizes the first three concepts and describes in detail the simulation constructs and the distributed and open architecture of SmartDB.

Reference-contexts: A hybrid system approach is used to model the combined discrete and continuous behavior. SmartDB allows the specification of both discrete and continuous behavior. 2.1.4 Object-Oriented Simulation SmartDB is an object-oriented <ref> [1, 2] </ref> software framework [5]. The object oriented approach is used to construct a logical model of the physical components and their control agents. The objects in the logical model have semantic content corresponding to their characteristics, inter-relationships, constraints, and behaviors.

Reference-contexts: The concepts for SmartDB have emerged from the SmartPath project at the California PATH Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley <ref> [3] </ref>. SmartDB is an object-oriented distributed processing simulation environment that can be scaled to meet the performance requirements of large-scale applications. SmartDB is an open system that can interface with other simulation environments.

Reference-contexts: The IVHS strategic plan <ref> [4] </ref> requires modeling and simulation in the following areas: urban traffic network models, traffic system models, vehicle-road models, driver-vehicle models, traffic models with dynamic traffic assignment, driving scenario simulation, and advanced vehicle control systems (AVCS) architecture simulation.

The process architecture that implements the layered architecture proposed by Varaiya <ref> [7] </ref> is shown in The physical layer is time driven and simulates the time driven engine objects that generate the vehicle displacements. The regulation layer is time driven. It contains event driven regulation supervisors and time driven maneuver objects.
