Title: Does Navigation Require More than One Compass?

Abstract: We present a methodology for automatically constructing structural hyperlinks for information navigation and retrieval in distributed corpora. A structural hyperlink connects components of a document that have specified structural properties with word-based content similarity. Our approach enables queries that may be posed in terms of keywords, as well as structural segments such as definitions, figures, etc.

Reference-contexts: The method for detecting organizational structure is to compute a graph whose nodes correspond to actual data blocks and whose edges are links weighted using the Smart similarity measure. We can examine the relationship between figures by using the Hausdorff shape comparison metric. <ref> [HR92] </ref> The Hausdorff distance is a metric defined between two point sets and it measures the degree to which each point in one set is near some point in the other set and vice-versa.

Reference-contexts: The Haus-dorff metric measures the distance between the most mismatched points in the sets A and B. In <ref> [RA95] </ref> we report on our experiences using the metric properties of the Hausdorff distance to cluster the collection robustly, to within some error tolerance in the shape mismatch. <p> Figure 5 describes our approach. An image can be related directly to text by explicit references and captions (the M-2 measure in Figure 5). The image can be related to other images directly by the Hausdorff number (the M-1 measure in Figure 5 <ref> [RA95] </ref>). The blocks of text that refer to the figure (for example, the figure caption and the block of text where the reference to the figure occurs) can be related to other paragraphs of text by means of the Smart similarity [Sal91] (the M-0 measure in Figure 5).

Reference-contexts: to determine topic and subtopic structures of a document, based upon or independent of its layout structure.[HP93, SABS94, SS94] In our own work, we have introduced robust algorithms with performance guarantees for segmentation as well as classification.[RS95b] Our vision for information access with structure-based information agents has been discussed in <ref> [RS95] </ref>. Structure has been identified as being a source of knowledge in other recent work.[FMSW93] In that study, they described a system that relies on SGML marked-up documents to support structured queries. The mark-up identifies the sections and paragraphs that comprise a document. <p> This hierarchy of indices drives retrieval in the manner of the Smart system. The structural tags assigned to text blocks can be used during retrieval in several ways: to limit the class 2 This filter is based upon the table extraction filter described in <ref> [RS95] </ref>, but has been extended to use pattern matching techniques to identify other types of blocks. of items retrieved, to help the user see the relationships between retrieved items, and to affect the manner in which retrieved items are displayed. 2.1 Limited displayed items The first of these uses is easy

Reference-contexts: After an overview of some related work, we outline our technique for identifying structural units and then discuss several ways that existing retrieval systems can be augmented to use the new information. This work was done using both the Smart system <ref> [Sal91] </ref> and Inquery.[Tur90] Inquery is particularly appropriate for this work because its retrieval model easily incorporates additional sources of evidence|e.g., structural cues. 1.1 Previous Work Our work draws on previous work in two distinct areas: information retrieval and automated document structuring. <p> Current information retrieval systems are primarily word- or word-group-driven.[SM83, Sal89, Tur90] The vector space model used in the Smart system <ref> [Sal91] </ref> has been used primarily for document retrieval, but is equally effective for document comparison,[SA93] and can also be used for the automatic identification and description of hypertext links.[All95] The goals of the document structuring community 1 title/author information represented as centered text. Page three has an itemized list. <p> We may compare two textual paragraphs, two tables, two definitions, two images, etc.[RA95] They give our system the capability to compare two images and two pieces of text. We can examine the relationships among the parts of documents using the vector space similarity measure of Smart <ref> [Sal91] </ref>. This process allows the discovery of organizational structures such as elaborations and edges are drawn between related parts. on a theme or contractions of a theme (see Figure 6), the relative flow of discourse in a collection, or clusters of similar scenarios (see Figure 7). <p> The blocks of text that refer to the figure (for example, the figure caption and the block of text where the reference to the figure occurs) can be related to other paragraphs of text by means of the Smart similarity <ref> [Sal91] </ref> (the M-0 measure in Figure 5). These three measures (M-0, M-1, M-2) can be combined to capture a similarity measure between an image and text that occur in the same document or even different documents (the dotted line in Figure 5).

Reference-contexts: We believe that this approach will work, but have not completed its evaluation. We are simultaneously investigating the use of inference networks as implemented in Inquery <ref> [Tur90] </ref> to address this problem. Inference networks provide a natural means for the combination of evidence and may present a more theoretically pleasing framework for our work. 4 Discussion Our research agenda is to develop and prototype a methodology for conceptual retrieval tasks in large, heterogeneous, distributed electronic libraries.
