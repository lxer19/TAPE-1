Abstract: One of the contributions of this paper is the introduction of a framework for evaluating the performance of optical flow estimators, which is based on classical estimation theory criteria, and on considerations about the computation cost. This framework is general, and may be applied to other estimation problems. The optic flow is widely used in many vision systems. It is a vector velocity field defined on sequences of images. The Affine Optic Flow is formed by the optical flow together with its first-order derivatives with respect to image coordinates. As a second contribution, we present two new estimators for the affine flow. We justify theoreticaly their design with hypotheses concerning the input images, which we show to be empirically valid. Finally, we use the performance analysis framework in order to compare the affine flow estimators with a more classical "differential" method.

Reference-contexts: There are many ways [7] to define a unique vector field that verifies equation (1) : Some involve regularization techniques (smoothness constraints on the flow), others assume that the flow fits certain models (e.g. local constancy <ref> [1] </ref>) and there are still other methods [10, 11], which make use of higher order image derivatives. 2.1 Affine Flow In this paper, we assume that the flow is an affine (vector valued) function (of the image plane coordinates) : u (x; y) = u 0 + (x x 0 )u <p> In fact, it involves only image values, and not image derivatives. Secondly, in order to estimate the flow, we will assume that it follows locally a given model (affine in our case, but other models could be used, as in <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The optic flow is defined as "the apparent motion of brightness patterns" in a sequence of images. It has been given many mathematical definitions, and many methods have been devised to compute it <ref> [2] </ref>. Very often, the optical flow is used as the input to other vision algorithms. For example, when identified with the motion field (the [optic] projection of the 3D motion onto the image plane), it allows to compute structure and/or motion of the watched scene.

Reference-contexts: We must choose a norm on R 6 .For example, the usual norm defined by: kfi ^ fik 2 is not satisfactory. An error of e.g. 0:1 would be penalized in the same way if it were committed on u 0 , which is typically in the range of <ref> [3; 3] </ref>, as if it was committed on u x , which ranges in [0:1; 0:1]. It is customary to use the norm defined by the (inverse of the) covariance matrix of the quantity one wants to study (which is then seen as a random variable). <p> Each estimate was the average of 20 estimates produced by "anisotropic-M" estimators, with 2000 observations. We are currently studying the validity of evaluating performances in this way. We justify empirically our method in <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore, when comparing performance on sequences with known ground-truth, the criteria ^ E and E fl give compatible results. A more technical approach could involve building confidence intervals for performance measures (for chosen confidence levels).

Reference-contexts: of the above expression has not given useful results, for the following reasons : * The optic flow problem is not, in general, a classical estimation problem, since the true parameter is not available, unless one uses synthetic data. * A covariance matrix may be calculated analytically as suggested in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, it is the covariance matrix of the limiting value lim k!1 ^ fi k . In our case we only perform a few iterations of the robust regression algorithm. Moreover, the expression involves the "noise" terms in the observation equation (8), which is poorly characterized.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 6 we draw some conclusions and establish further directions of research. Appendix A gives an introduction to the methods of robust regression, which are used at the core of both our estimators. 2 Optical Flow The optic flow is defined in <ref> [7] </ref> as "the apparent motion of brightness patterns" in a sequence of images. It is a velocity vector field defined over sequences of images, assuming that the pixels in one image displaced by that field do not change brightness level. <p> When x and y are real-valued, one easily sees that this definition is ill-posed, as there generally is no unique vector (u; v) verifying equation (1), but rather, infinitely many or none. There are many ways <ref> [7] </ref> to define a unique vector field that verifies equation (1) : Some involve regularization techniques (smoothness constraints on the flow), others assume that the flow fits certain models (e.g. local constancy [1]) and there are still other methods [10, 11], which make use of higher order image derivatives. 2.1 Affine <p> However, the implementation of our algorithm is more closely related to that of "differential techniques", which rely on the following well known interpretation of the definition of the optic flow <ref> [7] </ref>: where I x , I y are the spatial derivatives of the image sequence, I t is the time-derivative, and denotes a random noise term. 5 3.2 Observation Equation The presented estimators compute the affine flow by solving a system of "observation equations".

Reference-contexts: In practice, we will use over-constrained systems, with 50 to 3000 observations. A common method <ref> [8] </ref> to solve over-constrained systems of linear equations is robust regression, which we describe in appendix. For now, the important point is that this method is iterative. It yields a series of estimates ^ fi 1 , ^ fi 2 , ..., that eventually converges to the "correct" value. <p> This is an implicit definition of the solution ^ fi. Huber <ref> [8] </ref> suggests computing ^ fi by the following iterations : ^ fi k+1 = ^ fi k + (X T W k X) 1 X T W k (Y X: ^ fi k ) where W is diagonal, and W k Y i X i :fi k ) Y i X <p> The value of can also be computed iteratively <ref> [8] </ref>. Notice that when (x) = x 2 =2, we obtain the least squares solution in just one iteration. For , we have used either (x) = x if jxj &lt; 1 = jxj=x otherwise, yielding a so-called "Huber-estimator", or (x) = (x 2 + 1) with approximately equivalent results. <p> For , we have used either (x) = x if jxj &lt; 1 = jxj=x otherwise, yielding a so-called "Huber-estimator", or (x) = (x 2 + 1) with approximately equivalent results. Assympotically, the "Huber" robust estimator can be shown <ref> [8] </ref> to tend to a normal distribution, where the mean is the true value. 22 The "Anisotropic-M" algorithm presented in the paper, is not stricto-sensu a robust regression, since the observations are changed between iterations.

Reference-contexts: This is crucial in computer vision e.g. in active vision, where there are time-constraints to be met. We discuss the notion of "cost", as it may have many interpretations. Only recently have these two concepts been studied jointly 1 , e.g in <ref> [9] </ref>. To our knowledge, there are very few results linking the "quality" of an estimator to the "computational 1 "Experimental design", or "experience planning", goes in that direction, by considering the cost at which one does observations.

Reference-contexts: The optic flow and its (first) spatial derivatives together form the "affine flow", which is an even richer source of information, as shown in <ref> [14, 13] </ref>. An important and 1 well-known aspect of the optic flow is that it is ill-defined : it is based on a model that is only approximately correct. Knowing the nature of the error in this model is important for estimation algorithms.
