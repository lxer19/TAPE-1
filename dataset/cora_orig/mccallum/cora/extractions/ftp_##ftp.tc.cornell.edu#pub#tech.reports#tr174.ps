Abstract: For many boundary element methods applied to Laplace's equation in two dimensions, the resulting integral equation has both an integral with a logarithmic kernel and an integral with a discontinuous kernel. If standard collocation methods are used to discretize the integral equation we are left with two dense matrices. We consider expressing these matrices in terms of wavelet bases with compact support via a fast wavelet transform as in Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin. Upper bounds on the size of the wavelet transform elements are obtained. These bounds are then used to show that if the original matrices are of size N fiN , the resulting transformed matrices are sparse, having only O(N log N ) significant entries. Some numerical results will also be presented. Unlike Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin who use the fast wavelet transform as a numerical approximation to a continuous operator already expressed in a full wavelet basis of L 2 (IR), we think of the fast wavelet transform as a change of basis matrix for a finite dimension, and apply it to a discretized function or matrix. As a result, we can use this fast wavelet transform as a "black box" transformation in existing boundary element codes.

Reference-contexts: For a more detailed examination of iterative methods pertaining to Boundary Integral Equations, the reader is referred to Atkinson and Graham <ref> [1] </ref>, Schippers [19], Yan [23], and Vavasis [22]. If, in an iterative algorithm, we replace the original matrix/vector multiplications by applying the fast wavelet transform as mentioned in x1.2 above, we obtain a "black box" transformation which is easy to implement in an existing numerical iterative algorithm. <p> This is a consequence of Green's Second Integral Identity. Let 5 us now discretize the boundary in the following way: define fl : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 7! ; and define the nodal points t i via t i = N We will assume that fl is continuous and piecewise C M [0; 1] (for sufficiently large M ; see below) with a finite number of pieces, and that the parameterization of by fl is constant <p> Let 5 us now discretize the boundary in the following way: define fl : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 7! ; and define the nodal points t i via t i = N We will assume that fl is continuous and piecewise C M [0; 1] (for sufficiently large M ; see below) with a finite number of pieces, and that the parameterization of by fl is constant speed, that is kfl 0 (t)k = C; for some constant C &gt; 0, for all but a finite number of t 2 [0; 1] (the corners <p> piecewise C M <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (for sufficiently large M ; see below) with a finite number of pieces, and that the parameterization of by fl is constant speed, that is kfl 0 (t)k = C; for some constant C &gt; 0, for all but a finite number of t 2 [0; 1] (the corners of ). The nodal points on the boundary then occur at the equally spaced points fl (t i ); i = 1; : : : ; N . Naturally we must have fl (0) = fl (1); since is a simple closed curve. <p> Naturally we must have fl (0) = fl (1); since is a simple closed curve. Now let f i g i=1 be a sequence of basis functions defined periodically on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (e.g., polynomial splines). These basis functions should have the property that i (t k ) = 0 if i 6= k, and i (t i ) = 1. <p> We note, though, that many common basis functions for boundary element methods appearing in the literature, such as piecewise constant function and piecewise linear hat functions, sat isfy these assumptions. For s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, we can approximate (fl (s)) and @ @n (fl (s)) by (fl (s)) and @n (fl (s)) respectively, via (fl (s)) = i=1 @ (fl (s)) = i=1 6 where the p i 's and q i 's are unknown coefficients. <p> Here, (s) = 1 if s = 0 : The columns of A arising from V are evaluations of the function v j (t) = s=0 at the same equally-spaced points for the variable t over the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 3 Bounds on the derivatives and discretiza tions of the column functions In this section we will obtain bounds on the derivatives of the functions arising from the BEM equation (1), namely bounds on the functions u j (t) = s=0 and Z 1 K (fl (s); fl (t)) <p> Let us define the chord-arc number of to be 0s;t1 jjjs tjjj kfl (s) fl (t)k where jjjs tjjj measures the distance from s to t in the metric on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> induced by identifying 0 and 1. We will continue to use the above definition of jjj jjj throughout the paper. Because is a piecewise C M curve which has no cusps, a compactness argument (which we omit) can be used to show that this supremum is finite. <p> In the expression (14), f' fi i g i2Z are orthogonal. 4.2 Periodizing the discrete wavelet transform In the last section we described the wavelet transform for functions in L 2 (IR). Recall that our functions are defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> only. Indeed, because the boundary is a closed curve, our functions u j and v j are most easily understood as periodic functions on IR (so that u j (x) = u j (x + k) for all integers k). <p> Our goal in this section is to define the fast wavelet transform, a linear map W : IR N 7! IR N . With this in mind, let f 2 IR N be a given vector, which we view as being obtained from a function f (s); s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; discretized at N equally spaced points 0; 1 N ; : : : ; N1 N . We will speak of the function f (s) as being the parent function of f . We will refer to the ith element of f as f i . <p> Let f 2 IR N ; be a given vector, and let f (t) be its corresponding parent function, i.e. f i = f N for i = 1; 2; : : : ; N . Assume that f 2 C M <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with lim d k f (t) t!1 dt k ; k = 0; 1; : : : ; M: That is, the periodic extension of f should be an element of C M (IR). <p> n min s2supp j jjjt sjjj o M+1 7 by 4 max &lt; 1 2 - 2 ff jjj 1 2 - 2 ff jjj = 3 M+1 Substituting the above expression into (20), and changing the supremum of t 2 I - k to the supremum of t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> yields, for valid (k; -) jd - C (M )C ( )R (M ) p p sup (jw (x)j) sup (j'(x)j) (22) 4 max &lt; 1 2 - 2 ff jjj 1 2 - 2 ff jjj = 3 M+1 (23) We are interested in squaring the term jd
