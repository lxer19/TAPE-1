Abstract: A partition of an integer n is graphical if it is the degree sequence of a simple, undirected graph. It is an open question whether the fraction of partitions of n which are graphical approaches 0 as n approaches infinity. A partition is basic if the number of dots in its Ferrers graph is minimum among all partitions with the same rank vector as . In this paper, we investigate graphical partitions via basis partitions. We show how to efficiently count and generate graphical basis partitions and how to use them to count graphical partitions. We give empirical evidence which leads us to conjecture that, as n approaches infinity, the fraction of basis partitions of n which are graphical approaches the same limit as the fraction of all partitions of n which are graphical.

In order to be able to collect data for larger values of n, we need faster ways to count (ordinary or basic) graphical partitions, for example, by asymptotically reducing the storage requirements.

Reference-contexts: It was noted by Erd-os and Richmond [6] that all partitions in R (n) are graphical and hence g (n) r (n) = jR (n)j: They observe that r (n) = p (n) p (n 1) from a result of Bressoud <ref> [5] </ref> and that (p (n) p (n 1))=p (n) ~ = p 6n, from Roth and Szekeres [10], to 2 conclude that lim n!1 n g (n) p : Although every partition has a unique rank vector, the converse it not true.

Reference-contexts: The Durfee square of is the largest square sub-array of dots in the Ferrers diagram of . Let d denote the length of a side of the Durfee square. The rank vector of , defined in <ref> [7] </ref>, is the vector r = [r 1 ; r 2 ; : : : ; r d ] whose entries r i = i 0 i are the successive ranks of Atkin [1]. <p> For example, the partitions (8; 6; 4; 3; 3; 3; 1) and (5; 4; 3; 3) both have rank vector [1; 0; 1]. Gupta, in <ref> [7] </ref>, gives a one-to-one correspondence between rank vectors and a subclass of partitions which he calls basis partitions. <p> Suggestions for further research follow in Section 5. 2 Results on Basis Partitions We include here only results on basis partitions which will be required in this paper. For further information on basis partitions, including proofs omitted in this section, see <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. We focus first on the existence and uniqueness of basis partitions. 3 Theorem 1 [Gupta] Among all partitions with the same rank vector r = [r 1 ; : : : ; r k ], there is just one with minimum weight. <p> The following simple test will determine whether a partition is basic. Lemma 1 A partition with Durfee square of size d is basic if and only if both d = d or 0 for 1 i &lt; d : i = i+1 or 0 i+1 : (5) Gupta <ref> [7] </ref> notes the following bijection, where p (n; k) denotes the total number of par titions of n into parts of size at most k. Theorem 2 [Gupta] Let r = [r 1 ; : : : ; r d ] and let be the basis partition of r. <p> d 0; and otherwise, b (n; d) = b (n d; d) + b (n 2d + 1; d 1) + b (n 3d + 1; d 1): x x x x x x x x x x x r = (2,1,2) r = (0,-1) It has been shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that for a given rank vector, the corresponding basis partition is easy to construct. However, in Section 4, given a rank vector, we will need an explicit formula for the weight of its basis partition in terms of the rank vector elements.

Reference-contexts: Seven such criteria have been listed and shown to be equivalent in [13]. Among these, the most well known is the Erd-os-Gallai condition stated below: k X i k (k 1) + j=k+1 For a proof, see <ref> [8] </ref>, pp 59-61. A lesser-known condition is the Nash-Williams condition, which works with the rank vector of the partition.

Since the Nash-Williams condition uses only the rank vector of a partition to determine whether the partition is graphical, it becomes natural to consider families of partitions defined by their rank vectors.
