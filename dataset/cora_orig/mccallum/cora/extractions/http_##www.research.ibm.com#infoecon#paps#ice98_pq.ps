Abstract: We explore the price dynamics of a vertically differentiated market in which two or more sellers compete to provide an information good or service to a population of buyers. Each seller offers the good or service at a fixed level of "quality", and attempts to set its price in such a way that it maximizes its own profit. Five different seller pricing strategies, ranging widely from ones that require perfect knowledge and unlimited computational power to ones that require very little knowledge or computational capability, are employed in two different buyer populations, and the resulting collective dynamics are studied using a combination of analysis and simulation. In a population of quality-sensitive buyers, all pricing strategies lead to a price equilibrium predicted by a game-theoretic analysis. However, in a population of price-sensitive buyers, most pricing strategies lead to large-amplitude cyclical price wars. The circumstances under which cyclical price wars occur can be explained in terms of the topology of an underlying "profit landscape" [1].

Reference-contexts: We envision a world a decade or two hence in which billions of software agents will act as economic players in their own right, exchanging information goods and services with humans and with other agents <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. It is quite conceivable that the inclusion of large numbers of software agents as economic players will have a strong effect upon the global economy, giving rise to collective phe nomena that are rare or even unknown in today's economy. <p> Our previous work on an economy of information-filtering agents has shown that these differences, coupled with the reduced friction that one expects to find in agent-based information economies, can engender rampant price wars in which sellers' prices undergo periodic oscillations that can be harmful to sellers and buyers alike <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Another important distinguishing feature of software economic agents is that they are fundamentally more consistent and understandable in their individual behavior than their human counterparts. Understanding and modeling the decision-making behavior of individual humans is notoriously difficult. <p> Our study of the collective dynamics of large number of economic software agents <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref> is not an end in itself; it is motivated by the hope that we can derive principles that will help us to design effective agent strategies, interaction protocols, and market mechanisms [5]. <p> We are particularly interested in determining whether vertically differentiated markets are vulnerable to the same pathological, cyclical price wars that we have observed previously in a horizontally differentiated market in which seller agents offer filtered streams of news articles to buyer agents <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. After presenting the model in section 2, we shall find in sections 3 and 4 that, under some circumstances, the model does exhibit cyclical price wars. <p> In section 4, we only made a few changes to the buyers, and found that large-amplitude price wars were possible unless the sellers were derivative followers, in which case the game-theoretic analysis held. How can this behavior be explained? As has been discussed in <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>, the profit landscape is a useful construct for understanding price-war dynamics. A seller's profit landscape is its expected profit as a function with quality-sensitive buyers. The sellers' qualities are Q 1 = 1:0; Q 2 = 0:9. with quality-sensitive buyers. <p> It is possible to explain these price war dynamics (and their absence in the case of the derivative-following strategy) as resulting from the underlying topology of the profit landscape, a concept that was introduced in earlier papers <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Preliminary explorations indicate that multi-peaked landscapes and price-war dynamics can occur in cases more general than were reported here. <p> Finally, we expect the dynamics to get considerably more interesting when we permit sellers to vary their quality and their price simultaneously in an effort to maximize their profit. Previous work on an information filtering model <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref> has revealed the existence of very complex price and niche wars, in which the sellers in the economy all attempt to grab the same niche at the same price, leaving a large segment of the buyer population unsatisfied.

Reference-contexts: A network services market will be expected to offer multiple services at multiple rates, with low costs and latencies for switching from one service type to another. Market mechanisms capable of supporting these requirements are a topic of active research <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. As a second example, consider a market in which information brokers compete to provide information filtering services. As has been discussed, the varied preferences among users for different categories of information induce horizontal differentiation. However, there may be several vertical dimensions as well.
