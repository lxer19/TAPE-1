Abstract: We describe methods for managing the complexity of information displayed to people responsible for making high-stakes, time-critical decisions. The techniques provide tools for real-time control of the configuration and quantity of information displayed to a user, and a methodology for designing flexible human-computer interfaces for monitoring applications. After defining a prototypical set of display decision problems, we introduce the expected value of revealed information (EVRI) and the related measure of expected value of displayed information (EVDI). We describe how these measures can be used to enhance computer displays used for monitoring complex systems. We motivate the presentation by discussing our efforts to employ decision-theoretic control of displays for a time-critical monitoring application at the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston.

Reference-contexts: controlling the tradeoff between the completeness and the complexity of informational displays, computer-based explanations, and computational behavior [Horvitz et al., 1989], the use of multiattribute utility to control the complexity of presentations and displays [Horvitz, 1987a, Mclaughlin, 1987], and mul-tiattribute utility for queuing and prioritizing the results of diagnostic reasoning <ref> [Breese et al., 1991] </ref>. In other related work, qualitative models, in combination with several heuristic importance metrics have been employed to select information for monitoring applications [Doyle et al., 1989]. We will first review basic results from studies of human information processing about cognitive load, short-term memory, and decision making.

We look to future research in cognitive psychology for information about the costs associated with the review of information, including studies of how increased amounts of information and clutter can be expected to lead to delays, confusion, and, ultimately, to suboptimal decisions.

Reference-contexts: In time-critical contexts, the utilities of outcomes diminish significantly with delays in taking appropriate action. There are several classes of time-dependent decision problems and a variety of ways to represent variables and probabilistic dependencies to encode knowledge about time-dependence of outcome and utility <ref> [Horvitz, 1987b, Horvitz, 1988] </ref>. In one approach, we model explicitly the time-dependent progression of important states of a system under the influence of processes that may persist over time.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, it may be appropriate to assess an outcome as an equilibrium state, reached at some time following a set of interventions, and to assess the utility of this equilibrium state <ref> [Horvitz, 1990] </ref>. We can attempt to minimize the detailed modeling of the temporal progression of system states by assessing the time-dependent changes in the utility of outcomes that are defined in terms of a system (or world) state and interventions made at various times.

Reference-contexts: We can extend the EVDI measure by considering uncertainty in delays, and by conditioning the probability distribution over length of delay on the quantity of evidence, and on such information as an operator's predicted uncertainty about the best action <ref> [Horvitz, 1995] </ref>. 6 MODELING USER ACTIONS In time-critical contexts, the goal of a display manager is to assist a user with taking the best action as soon as possible.

The Vista Project was initiated in 1991 to develop inferential tools to assist flight engineers at the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston with the interpretation of telemetry from the Space Shuttle. <p> In addition to providing a probability distribution over faults, the system also generates recommendations about ideal action.

In one class of time-critical decision problem, representing a large class of high-stakes, time-critical monitoring tasks, we gain access to information about system's behavior at time t 0 and attempt to diagnose and take action to respond to the anomalous state of the system.

Reference-contexts: The capacity of decision makers to consider important influences on a decision may be reduced even further if fast action is demanded in crisis situations. One cognitive-psychology study demonstrated that people cannot retain and reason simultaneously about more than two concepts in environments filled with distractions <ref> [Waugh and Norman, 1965] </ref>. These and other cognitive psychology findings provide motivation for automated methods that can balance the value and costs of displayed information. 3 TIME-CRITICAL DECISIONS The costs versus the benefits of spending time to review additional information are sensitive to the time criticality of a situation.
