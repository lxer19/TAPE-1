Abstract: In this paper a method to decompose a conventional feature space (LPC-cepstrum) into subspaces which carry information about the linguistic and speaker variability is presented. Principal component analysis is used to study the correlation between these sub-spaces. Oriented principal component analysis (OPCA) is then used to estimate a sub-space which is relatively speaker-independent. A method to estimate the dimensionality of the speaker independent sub-space is also presented. Original features can now be projected into the speaker independent sub-space to make them less sensitive to speaker variations. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing the speaker dependence is studied by experiments conducted on two different databases.

Reference-contexts: They are called oriented due to the fact that the principal component e o is steered by the distribution of d s . It will be oriented towards the direction where d s has the minimum variance while maximizing the projection energy of d l <ref> [1] </ref>. From now onwards we refer to the ratio e T R l e e T R s e as the signal-to-noise ratio.

Reference-contexts: The solid line in Figure 4 shows the variation of the weighted SNR. From the figure it is evident that the linguistic information can be efficiently represented by approximately four basis vectors. This observation is consistent with the earlier work reported by Hermansky <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Results indicate that the proposed method to represent the LI and SI by appropriate difference vectors is effective in identifying subspaces corresponding to the LI and SI.
