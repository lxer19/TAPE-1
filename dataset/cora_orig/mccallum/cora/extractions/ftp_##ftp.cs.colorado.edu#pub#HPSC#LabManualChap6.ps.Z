Abstract: In this chapter, you will gain experience using and programming a SIMD computer. The programming language we use on the Thinking Machines CM-2 is called CM Fortran; this is a superset of Fortran 77 with parallel extensions similar to those in Fortran 90. On the MasPar MP-1 or MP-2, we use MasPar Fortran (MPF). Versions of C (C*) and Lisp (*Lisp) are also available on the Thinking Machines CM-2, and MasPar provides MPL, a data-parallel version of C.

Reference-contexts: A full discussion of the concepts and techniques needed to obtain good performance on a SIMD machine is beyond the range of this chapter. You need to review the tutorial on "SIMD Computing: An Introduction " [Schauble 95b] as well as the tutorial "Using the TMC CM-2 " <ref> [Schauble 94] </ref> or the tutorial "Using the MasPar MP-1 and MP-2 ." You may also wish to refer the "CM Fortran Programming Guide" [TMC 91a], the "CM Fortran User's Guide" [TMC 91c], and the "CM Fortran Reference Manual " [TMC 91b] if you are using the Thinking Machines CM-2.

Reference-contexts: The ftp command can be used to copy files on your local workstation to and from the SIMD computer's front end. See the man page on ftp or the "ftp Short Reference" <ref> [Schauble 95a] </ref> for more information. More comments on the CM-2 results Even though this program never uses the CM-2 processors (just the front end), we still need to attach the PPU processors for the program execution. These processors must be attached before the program is allowed to run.
