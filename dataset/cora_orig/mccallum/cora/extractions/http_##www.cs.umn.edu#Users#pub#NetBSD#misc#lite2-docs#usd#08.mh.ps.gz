Reference: 1. <author> Crocker, D. H., J. J. Vittal, K. T. Pogran, and D. A. Henderson, Jr., </author> <title> ``Standard for the Format of ARPA Network Text Messages,'' </title> <address> RFC733, </address> <month> November </month> <year> 1977. </year>
Reference-contexts: As computer networking becomes more common, however, it is becoming more feasible to communicate with anyone whose computer can be linked to your own via a network. The pioneering efforts on general-purpose electronic mail were by organizations using the DoD ARPAnet <ref> [1] </ref>. The capability to send messages between computers existed before the ARPAnet was developed, but it was used only in limited ways.

Reference-contexts: The message system described in this report, MH, provides most of the features that can be found in other message systems and also incorporates some new ones. It has been built on the UNIX time-sharing system <ref> [2] </ref>, a popular operating system for the DEC PDP-11 1 and USD:8-2 The RAND Message Handling System: User Manual VAX-11 classes of computers. A ``secure'' operating system similar to UNIX is currently being developed [3], and that system will also run MH.

This report provides a complete description of MH and thus may serve as a user's manual, although parts of the report will be of interest to non-users as well.

Reference-contexts: A novel approach has been taken in the design of MH. Instead of creating a large subsystem that appears as a single command to the user (such as MS <ref> [4] </ref>), MH is a collection of separate commands which are run as separate programs. The file and directory system of UNIX are used directly. Messages are stored as individual files (datasets), and collections of them are grouped into directories.

Reference-contexts: If an explicit form switch is given to the comp command, it will override the switch obtained from the profile. 1 By defining the envariable $MH, you can specify an alternate profile to be used by MH commands. 2 See chmod (1) in the UNIX Programmer's Manual <ref> [5] </ref>. The RAND Message Handling System: User Manual USD:8-7 USD:8-8 The RAND Message Handling System: User Manual In UNIX, a program may exist under several names, either by linking or aliasing. The actual invocation name is used by an MH program when scanning for its profile defaults 3 .
