Abstract: Previous work on the "-complexity of elliptic boundary-value problems Lu D f assumed that the class F of problem elements f was the unit ball of a Sobolev space. In a recent paper, we considered the case of a model two-point boundary-value problem, with F being a class of analytic functions. In this paper, we ask what happens if F is a class of piecewise analytic functions. We find that the complexity depends strongly on how much a priori information we have about the breakpoints. If the location of the breakpoints is known, then the "-complexity is proportional to ln." 1 /, and there is a finite element p-method (in the sense of Babuska) whose cost is optimal to within a constant factor. If we know neither the location nor the number of breakpoints, then the problem is unsolvable for " &lt; 2. If we know only that there are b 2 breakpoints, but we don't know their location, then the "-complexity is proportional to b" 1 , and a finite element h-method is nearly optimal. In short, knowing the location of the breakpoints is as good as knowing that the problem elements are analytic, whereas only knowing the number of breakpoints is no better than knowing that the problem elements have a bounded derivative in the L 2 sense. p

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Most work on the "-complexity of elliptic boundary-value problems Lu D f has assumed that the class F of problem elements f consisted of functions whose smoothness was fixed and known, see, e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, if F is the unit ball of a Sobolev space, then comp."/ is a power of " 1 ; moreover, we found conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a finite element h-method 1 to be (almost) optimal. <p> if we know how many breakpoints there are (but not their location) and that there are at least two of them, then the assumption that the problem elements are piecewise analytic is not much better than the assumption that they have a bounded derivative in the L 2 sense (see <ref> [6, Section 5.5] </ref>. In short, piecewise analyticity buys us very little if there are more than two pieces. Note that the case of one breakpoint whose location is unknown is still open. We now outline the contents of this paper. <p> PROBLEM DESCRIPTION Let I D .1; 1/.

Reference-contexts: If we restrict ourselves to such f , then we don't have to worry so much about quantifying the exact smoothness of f . Moreover, any lack of smoothness can be confined to a small set of points. In an earlier paper <ref> [7] </ref>, we looked at the case of analytic F for a simple model two-point boundary-value problem. These results were encouraging. <p> D O.q 2 / as n ! 1 PROOF: To see that the lower bound in part (1) holds, note that F .D / F ;b , and so r .n; F ;b / r .n; F .D // D .q 1 / as n ! 1; the latter by <ref> [7, Theorem 3.1] </ref>. We now turn to the upper bound in part (2). Choose f 2 F , and let u D Sf . Write e D u 5 k;1 u and Qe D f 5 k;1 f . <p> Thus for j D 0 and j D 1, we have ke .j/ k 2 bC1 X ke .j/ k 2 bC1 X l s X ke .i/ k 2 5 From Lemmas A.1, A.2, and A.4 of <ref> [7] </ref>, we have kek 2 M 2 4. 1/ and L 2 .1 i / h i 2kC1 .k C 2/ 2 . 1/ C .k C 1/ 2 . 1/ 5 .k C 3 Similarly, we have k Qek 2 bC1 X l s X k Qek 2 with k <p> 2 .1 i / h i 2kC1 .k C 2/ 2 . 1/ C .k C 1/ 2 . 1/ 5 .k C 3 Similarly, we have k Qek 2 bC1 X l s X k Qek 2 with k Qek 2 4. 1/ by Lemmas A.1 and A.3 of <ref> [7] </ref>. Combining these results and using (3.1), we find ku u n k H 1 .I/ D O. km/ h kC1=2 p 4. 1/ ; the latter since m D 2= h. <p> fi k Qek L 2 .1 i / kvk L 2 .1 i / k Qek L 2 .1 i / : From [6, Lemma A.2.3.3], we have k Qek L 2 .1 i / C 2 n 2 kf 00 k L 2 .1 i / ; while from <ref> [7, Lemma A.3] </ref>, we have kf 00 k L 2 .1 i / 2 : Hence X fi fi Z Qe.x/v.x/ dx fi fi Cn 1 2 : (4.9) From (4.7), (4.8) and (4.9), we find that fi fi Z Qe.x/v.x/ dx fi fi 16 C 1 b C C 3
