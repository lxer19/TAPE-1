Abstract: This paper considers optical networks which employ wavelength-routing switches that enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, called lightpaths, between node-pairs. In such networks, the failure of a single link may cause the failure of several optical channels. Given a set of lightpaths, that may comprise of a virtual topology, and fixed alternate routing tables at each node, this paper examines the following problem: how to allocate capacity in an optimal fashion and assign routes and wavelengths to each lightpath such that upon any link failure lightpaths that are affected by the failure, can be reestablished without any blocking. A simple approach, called one-on-one protection, protects against link failures by reserving a link-disjoint backup lightpath for every working lightpath. In this paper, we examine an Integer Programming (IP) approach, called multiplexed spare capacity protection, that multiplexes the spare capacity among all lightpaths in an optimal fashion. This paper examines the performance of this approach on representative network topologies, and shows that this approach is superior to one-on-one protection.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength division-multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1] </ref> divides the tremendous bandwidth of a fiber (potentially a few tens of terabits per second) into many nonoverlapping wavelengths (WDM channels). Each channel can be operated asynchronously and in parallel at any desirable speed, e.g., peak electronic speed of a few Gbps.

Reference-contexts: We assume that routing tables are statically specified at each node. Fixed alternate routing provides benefits that includes the following: (a) simplicity of control needed to setup and teardown lightpaths, and (b) fault tolerance upon link failures <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. For the networks we consider in this paper, the routing tables at nodes are ordered by the hop distance to the destination. Therefore, the shortest hop path to the destination is the first route in the routing table.

Reference-contexts: Since lightpaths are expected to carry data at data rates of the order of a few gigabits per second, the failure of a lightpath can potentially lead to large data losses. Physical protection <ref> [5] </ref> is a potential approach to recover from failures. In physical protection, hardware components are duplicated to provided redundancy at the physical level. Upon a failure, the redundant hardware is activated automatically, without the higher layers of software being aware of the failure. <p> Upon a failure, the redundant hardware is activated automatically, without the higher layers of software being aware of the failure. Physical protection is however expensive because of the hardware duplication that is necessary. Another approach to protecting against link failures, called one-on-one, or design protection <ref> [5] </ref>, is to reserve a backup lightpath for every lightpath that needs to be protected against link failures. The backup lightpaths are designed such that they do not share any links with their corresponding working lightpaths. <p> The multiplexed spare-capacity approach trades-off the economy of spare-capacity allocation with the protocol complexity to establish backup lightpaths upon a link failure. 4 1.1 Previous work Fault tolerant design of virtual topologies has been studied in <ref> [5] </ref>.
