Reference-contexts: First the network will set the prices and then adjust pricing based on the amount of resources users attempt to purchase. They differ in the way prices are adjusted and in the objective function that is maximized. 4.1 Network performs maximization of welfare In <ref> [1] </ref>, S. H. Low & P. P. Varaiya described a system whereby the network offers for rent its bandwidth and buffers. Users purchase resources to meet their desired quality. <p> Also, frequent changes in demand would cause oscillations in the prices that are highly undesirable. Also, as mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>, the fact that the network resources are reserved means that network utilization will be low. In [2] a method to tie cell loss with pricing of buffers and bandwidth is described. Perhaps when cell loss is taken into account, sharing of resources can be incorporated into the model. <p> The presentation in our textbook [10] (which is related to the work described in <ref> [1] </ref>) is one of the most comprehensive schemes presented. <p> Thus the network lets through only the most important packets in times of congestion. Although not comprehensive, this scheme can be used to determine the appropriate price for ABR traffic. In some sense, this scheme can be view as a special case of the scheme described in <ref> [1] </ref>, in which the network offers it's resources for rent to users. As shown by F. P. Kelly in [16] the pricing structure can be used to encourage users to estimate the statistics of their traffic to the best of their abilities and reveal their knowledge to the network.

Reference-contexts: Also, the minimization algorithm run by the 'network' is computationally expensive; it invokes lots of message passing to determine the amount of demand, and the price of each resource in every node of the route. 4.2 Pareto efficiency: demand equals supply The work described in <ref> [3] </ref> is based on the concept of Pareto efficiency. A set of allocations is Pareto efficient if no traffic class can improve upon these allocations without reducing the total utility of all traffic classes. 4.2.1 Types of services being priced An arbitrary number of traffic classes can be priced. <p> A traffic class consists of sessions that share buffer and link resources. Each traffic class has its own utility function that measures the tradeoff between different types of resources it is willing to accept. The economic model discussed in <ref> [3] </ref> is able to take into account loss probability, max-delay, and average delay constraints. 4.2.2 Objective Function and constraints The objective is to find the Pareto allocations of resources that satisfy the QoS requirements of all the traffic classes, as well as the equilibrium prices where demand equals supply. 4.2.3 Pricing

Reference-contexts: This involves computation that minimizes some set of equations which give the allocations. The second method is competitive equilibrium, where the network providers set prices, and users compute their demands. When demands equals supply, equilibrium is attained. in <ref> [4] </ref> [5] it is shown, using simulations, that prices converge to optimum price. 4.2.5 Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages and disadvantages are almost the same as described in section 4.1.5 and section 4.1.6. The differences are that the network has to place session's requirements into a specific traffic class.

Reference-contexts: This actively encourages users to reduce traffic inflow when the network is congested, so that an acceptable level of network load is maintained. 5.1 Based on percentage utilization In <ref> [6] </ref>, MacKie-Mason and Varian point out that pricing based on congestion is an effective way to reduce congestion, and to generate revenue for capacity expansion. <p> They also described a pricing scheme where charges are based on usage and utilization of the bandwidth. 5.1.1 Types of services being priced The diversity of services offered depends on cost structure and user preferences. In <ref> [6] </ref>, only a single quality of service is considered. 5.1.2 Objective Function and constraints The main idea is to internalize the external congestion costs. <p> Users who do not not mind the delay will wait for a lower price, thus reducing network load. The usage based component will be charged on top of a "connection fee" similar to the two-part tariff scheme envisioned in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5.2.4 Algorithm The price is adjusted based on the current network conditions. It will go to infinity when usage approaches capacity and fall to zero when the network is not used. The distributed pricing algorithm goes as in Figure 9 1 given in [6]. <p> the two-part tariff scheme envisioned in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5.2.4 Algorithm The price is adjusted based on the current network conditions. It will go to infinity when usage approaches capacity and fall to zero when the network is not used. The distributed pricing algorithm goes as in Figure 9 1 given in [6]. Similar to other algorithms in this class, the algorithm is iterative and distributed.

Reference-contexts: These considerations clearly have to be taken into account when implementing congestion based pricing schemes. 5.2 Based on the amount of network load L. Murphy, J. Murphy in <ref> [7] </ref> described a pricing scheme based on feedback pricing.

Reference-contexts: The authors of the paper themselves question whether their approach of pricing virtual paths (instead of individual virtual circuits) is compatible with the rest of the literature on ATM pricing. 5.4 Based on Opportunities cost This work is described in <ref> [8] </ref> and [9]. It deals with the problem of pricing and capacity investment for ATM network with time-varying demand. <p> Under this scheme the user would be forced to estimate ABR traffic's characteristics. An algorithm that provides a more reasonable treatment of ABR traffic is described by Q. Wang, J.M. Peha, and M.A. Sirbu in <ref> [8] </ref>. It consists of three parts, which iteratively determine what proportion of the network should be used for ABR traffic and what proportion should be reserved for guaranteed services based on users' demands for ABR and guaranteed services.

Reference-contexts: Algorithm We will describe briefly how the main algorithm works, and how the algorithm is to be implemented (i.e. whether it is distributed, centralized etc.) * Advantages and Disadvantages The main advantages and disadvantages of the schemes will be outlined. 3 Models Based on Effective Bandwidth Effective bandwidth, described in <ref> [10] </ref> is a measure of the cost of carrying a VBR connection. It is a function of the maximum delay tolerated, the burstiness of the data stream, and the mean rate. Several pricing models are based on effective bandwidth. <p> The presentation in our textbook <ref> [10] </ref> (which is related to the work described in [1]) is one of the most comprehensive schemes presented. <p> A reasonable, practical pricing scheme will probably combine different aspects of the above mentioned algorithms. In the next section we propose a billing architecture that is flexible enough to support most of the various pricing schemes. 7 Billing Architecture As mentioned in <ref> [10] </ref> there are four charges to be considered while pricing a network | fixed or access charge, usage charge, congestion charge and service quality charge.

Reference-contexts: Also, the algorithm provides a Pareto set of allocation giving the network provider a choice among the different Pareto allocations. 4.3 Pricing ABR Services for efficient network utilization In <ref> [11] </ref>, a pricing scheme for ABR services which leads to an economically efficient utilization of network resources is discussed. <p> After this, congestion in the links will be monitored periodically (say, every 20 minutes) and prices will be adjusted based on this. Congestion is measured using a scheme outlined in <ref> [11] </ref> and illustrated in Figure 3. Every source periodically sends Resource Management (RM) cells. When a destination receives RM cells it sends them back to the source, possibly adding an explicit rate (ER) at which it can accept information.

Reference-contexts: Similar to other algorithms in this class, the algorithm is iterative and distributed. In each round, network tries to equate marginal cost and price based on feedback from the users. 5.2.5 Advantages and Disadvantages Same as in section 5.1.5. 5.3 Pricing an embedded ATM network <ref> [12] </ref> describes a scheme to charge users operating within a virtual private (ATM) network in order to manage network traffic effectively. This paper contends that enforcing the mean rate may be impractical.
Reference: [13] <author> H. Jiang, S. </author> <title> Jordan "The Role of Price in the Connection Establishment Process", </title> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: This algorithm can be made dynamic by allowing users to change their estimates. 2 3.1.5 Disadvantages This pricing scheme is incomplete. It ignores ABR traffic pricing. Fixed charges, congestion charges are not discussed. 3.2 QoS pricing based on effective bandwidth In <ref> [13] </ref>, effective bandwidth, which models a source's use of network resources at the user/network interface, is used to characterize and price network resources consumed by a user. 3.2.1 Type of service being priced A scheme to price ATM networks providing guaranteed performance to variable bit rate (VBR) services in addition to <p> of network resources at the user/network interface, is used to characterize and price network resources consumed by a user. 3.2.1 Type of service being priced A scheme to price ATM networks providing guaranteed performance to variable bit rate (VBR) services in addition to the regular "best-effort" service is discussed in <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.2.2 Objective function and constraints The objective of this scheme is to maximize user surplus while efficiently utilizing available network resources. Network resources are partitioned at three levels: virtual circuit (VC), circuit bundle (CB), and virtual path (VP).

Reference-contexts: Lastly, the paper discusses pricing schemes only for ABR or best-effort traffic | QoS based pricing is not taken into account. 4.4 QoS based pricing to optimize resource allocation As with many of the previous papers, the following paper <ref> [15] </ref> by de Veciana and Baldick puts forth a pricing scheme to do admission control and allocate network resources efficiently. 4.4.1 Types of services being priced The paper incorporates two types of service | real-time and best-effort. Real-time connections are guaran teed low-delay and small probability of loss.

Reference-contexts: Several pricing models are based on effective bandwidth. The main idea is that effective bandwidth reflects the amount of resources a stream with a required QoS consumes, and thus pricing based on effective bandwidth is reasonable. 3.1 User estimates effective bandwidth. In <ref> [16] </ref>, F. Kelly proposes a pricing scheme based on effective bandwidth. Users are charged based on the effective bandwidth that their traffic requires. When effective bandwidth is used for pricing, the network has to police users, to make sure that they give the true bandwidth of their traffic. <p> In some sense, this scheme can be view as a special case of the scheme described in [1], in which the network offers it's resources for rent to users. As shown by F. P. Kelly in <ref> [16] </ref> the pricing structure can be used to encourage users to estimate the statistics of their traffic to the best of their abilities and reveal their knowledge to the network.

Reference-contexts: If the demands change, new optimal prices for guaranteed and best-effort services have to be determined by running the entire algorithm again. A simple distributed algorithm for pricing of Internet packets was proposed in <ref> [17] </ref> by J. MacKie-Mason and H. Varian. It uses the concept of smart markets to send through packets of higher value in times of congestion. <p> This way, the complexity of the billing architecture would be much reduced, and users would get a simpler, easier to use service. To further reduce the complexity, the above architecture could be combined with digital commerce systems (See <ref> [17] </ref>). One possibility is to make users purchase "digital stamps" in advance. Every time a connection is established, these "digital stamps" will be automatically used up.

Reference-contexts: In the paper it is mentioned that since prices are set to be higher when there is congestion, this generates extra revenue for the network provider to fund capicity expansion. We found an interesting counter-argument put forth by D. W. Crawford in <ref> [18] </ref>. He mentioned that the network providers might withhold capacity since that is profitable. This can be done by not building capacity, hiding capacity by route blocking, or buying back capacity themselves.
