Title: The inherent inaccuracy of implicit tridiagonal QR  
Author: James W. Demmel 
Address: Berkeley, California 94720  
Affiliation: University of California  
Abstract: Recently Demmel and Veselic showed that Jacobi's method has a tighter relative error bound for the computed eigenvalues of a symmetric positive definite matrix than does QR iteration. Here we show the weaker error bound of QR as implemented in LAPACK's SSTEQR or EISPACK's IMTQL is unavoidable. We do this by presenting a particular symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix for which QR must fail, given any reasonable shift strategy.

Reference-contexts: Let cond (T ) = kT k 2 kT 1 k 2 denote the condition number of T , and * denote the machine precision (which we take to be appropriate for IEEE double precision arithmetic: 2 52 2 10 16 <ref> [1] </ref>). Demmel and Veselic [5] showed that relative perturbations of size in the entries of T can cause relative perturbations of size at most about cond (A) in its eigenvalues.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, since cond (A 0 ) &lt; 1:6, all the eigenvalues are determined to high relative accuracy by the data and will be computed to nearly full machine precision by Jacobi. Our example and proof work only for the implicit QR algorithm as implemented in LAPACK subroutine SSTEQR <ref> [2] </ref> or EISPACK subroutines IMTQL1 and IMTQL2 [7]. A different proof would be needed for the the root-free QR algorithm in EISPACK (TQLRAT) or LAPACK (SSTERF). Indeed, provided one interprets "tridiagonal QR" sufficiently liberally, one can find a very accurate version for positive definite matrices.

Reference-contexts: Using an exact eigenvalue as a shift corresponds to the "perfect shift" strategy discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. I believe the result to be true for quite arbitrary shifts strategies as well. Let T 1 denote the matrix after one QR step. The proof has three steps: 1.
