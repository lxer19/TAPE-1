Abstract: This paper deals with typical problems that arise when using wavelets in numerical analysis applications. The first part involves the construction of quadrature formulae for the calculation of inner products of smooth functions and scaling functions. Several types of quadratures are discussed and compared for different classes of wavelets. Since their construction using monomials is ill-conditioned, also a modified, well-conditioned construction using Chebyshev polynomials is presented. The second part of the paper deals with pointwise asymptotic error expansions of wavelet approximations of smooth functions. They are used to to derive asymptotic interpolating properties of the wavelet approximation and to construct a convergence acceleration algorithm. This is illustrated with numerical examples.

Reference-contexts: This technique is also used successfully in [12, 19]. The Chebyshev polynomial T n (x) of degree n is defined by T 0 (x) = 1, T 1 (x) = x and T n (x) = 2 x T n1 (x) T n2 (x) for n &gt; 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. Since the interesting properties of these polynomials only hold in the interval [1; 1], we transform the scaling function '(x) to this interval yielding a function ' fl (y). <p> Since the interesting properties of these polynomials only hold in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, we transform the scaling function '(x) to this interval yielding a function ' fl (y). <p> Proof. If '(x) is continuous, so is t (x) since the series (3.10) converges uniformly. The proof follows from t (0) = t (1) = 2 N 1 2 N 2 (0); which means that t (x) has at least two changes of sign in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In the cases we considered, it turns out that (x) and t (x) have exactly two zeros as can be seen in the figures. We will denote the zeros of t (x) in [0; 1) by x 1 and x 2 with x 1 &lt; x 2 . <p> In this section we consider an example with f (x) = exp (20 (x 0:5) 2 ); WAVELET QUADRATURES AND ERROR EXPANSIONS 21 Fig. 3.3. 1 (x) and 1 (x) for Daubechies' wavelets with N = 2; 5; 8 where we look at the error in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Figure 3.4 shows the error E 6 f (x) obtained with a computer program calculating P 6 f (x)f (x). The wavelet used is the Daubechies wavelet with 3 vanishing moments. One can check that the interpolating properties are satisfied.

Reference-contexts: This formula was used in numerical analysis applications in <ref> [3] </ref>. The coiflets have the disadvantage that their support width is 3N 1. This results in a 50% increase in computational cost for the fast wavelet transform in comparison with the original Daubechies' wavelets with the same number of vanishing moments whose support width is only 2N 1. 2.4. <p> In order to have a non-zero range for the shift t , the parameters r and s should be chosen such that (r 1)2 s &lt; L. This technique to construct quadrature formulae is also used in <ref> [3] </ref> but there the shift t is given a fixed value. Since there are r + 1 unknowns ft; w 1 ; : : : ; w r g, one can try to achieve a degree of accuracy r.

In [9] she constructed so called "most symmetric" wavelets, who have the closest to linear phase of all wavelets with support length 2N 1 and N vanishing moments.

Reference-contexts: It also follows from Peano's theorem in <ref> [10] </ref>. Note that we do not impose any regularity conditions on '(x). The number of abscissae r determines the efficiency of a quadrature formula since the number of function evaluations and algebraic operations is proportional to r.
