Reference-contexts: Remark 10.3.4 (scope of the compensation approach) Above we developed an approach to solve the shortest queue problem. Now the question arises: what is the scope of this approach? In <ref> [3] </ref> this approach has been applied to a class of two dimensional processes on the lattice in the positive quadrant of R 2 and conditions 117 have been derived under which the approach works.

In <ref> [3] </ref> this approach has been applied to a class of two dimensional processes on the lattice in the positive quadrant of R 2 and conditions 117 have been derived under which the approach works. [3] considers processes for which the transition rates are constant in the interior points and also constant on each of the axes. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that the transitions are restricted to neighboring states.

Reference-contexts: Under certain conditions for the interarrival time distribution it can be shown that the roots x k can be found by successive substitutions similar as in section 7.1.3 (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Finally we remark that the analysis in this section can easily be extended to the case of processing times with a mixed Erlang distribution (see figure 4.4). 73 7.3 Exercises Exercise 7.3.1 (Rouche's theorem) Rouche's theorem reads as follows.

Reference-contexts: In case of Erlang distributed interarrival and service times a refinement of the representation above can be obtained, i.e., the coefficients B k (l; i 1 ; : : : ; i r ) can be explicitly determined (see <ref> [5] </ref>). 8.3 Pooling or not? In this section we will compute and compare the mean production lead time over all jobs for the dedicated system and the system in which the machines are pooled.

Reference-contexts: Before discussing some of the important Operations Research applications that can be described and analyzed using fluid-flow models we first introduce the model. The presentation is based on the paper [54], who used a somewhat different analysis and the paper <ref> [6] </ref>. For a very extensive list of references we refer [32]. 11.1 The mathematical model Mathematically, the model we consider is the following. There are two machines, Machine 1 and Machine 2.

In [7, 8] it is shown that even the more general C k =C r =s system can analyzed along these lines.

Reference-contexts: For these systems a variety of questions is addressed, such as: `Which items should be stocked or made to order?' and `How must production capacity allocated among MTO and MTS items?' In section 9.1 we first consider some simple queueing models for inventory systems related to the produce-to-stock systems in <ref> [11] </ref>, and investigate the relation between inventory and the production lead time. In particular tails of the production lead time distribution tend to be rather thick. Section 9.2 deals with the two type system, standard products to stock, specific products to order.

Reference-contexts: From these probabilities it is straightforward to compute the distribution and moments of the production lead time.

Some of these items ar produced to stock, others are produced to order. The MTO items have priority over MTS items.

Reference-contexts: The idea of the approach is to reduce the infinite 70 system of balance equations to a finite one using the geometric tail behavior (if it exists) of the state probabilities. Many applications of this approximation can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. The approach will be explained for the present model. Replace p n by p N x nN 1 in (7.9)-(7.10) and in the normalization equation, where N is a sufficiently large integer.

We added c 1 ff m 1 fi n 0 to compensate for the error on the vertical boundary m = 0 and by doing so introduced a new error on the horizontal boundary n = 1, since this term violates condition (10.2).

Reference-contexts: It is known to be optimal when the processing times are exponentially distributed or have a nondecreasing failure rate which means that the longer the job has been in process, the more likely it is completed shortly (see <ref> [51, 47, 22] </ref>). But in [49] it is shown that there also distributions of the processing times for which it is not optimal to join the shortest queue.

Reference-contexts: These concepts can be found is every standard textbook on these topics, see e.g. <ref> [27, 44] </ref>. 4.1 Random variable In this report random variables are denoted by capitals, X, Y , etc. The expected value or mean of X is denoted by E (X) and its variance by var (X), or by oe 2 (X) where oe (X) is the standard deviation of X. <p> This set can be countably infinite, or even continuous, and the resulting solution may be expressed as an infinite sum, or an integral. An explicit solution for the probabilities p n (t) can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. The expression presented there (see p. 77) is an infinite sum of modified Bessel functions. So already one of the simplest interesting queueing models leads to an ugly expression for the time-dependent behavior of its state probabilities.

Reference-contexts: So the system earns an average reward of E (S) dollar per unit time. Obviously, the system earns the same in both cases. For a rigorous proof, see <ref> [41] </ref>. 4.7 PASTA property For queueing systems with Poisson arrivals, so for M== systems, the very special property holds that arriving customers find on the average the same situation in the queueing system as someone who is passing by (and not entering) at a random moment.

Reference-contexts: In [29, 46] a proof is given that the overall optimal policy is of the same type as the individual optimal policy, but presumable with a different threshold N . The issue of individually versus socially optimal policies is also studied in <ref> [42] </ref> for the problem of controlling the arrivals to a single-server queue. Below we will study the model in which jobs are processed by the slow machine only when the number of jobs in the system is more than N .

Hence as n ! 1, p n C 1 (1 x 1 )x n This geometric tail behavior arises in many queueing and inventory applications (see e.g. <ref> [43] </ref>). The property is used in [45] to derive a simple approximation for solving the balance equations of an infinite Markov chain.

Reference-contexts: From these probabilities it is straightforward to compute the distribution and moments of the production lead time. Numerical results show that combining MTO and MTS effectively reduces production lead times. The literature on these hybrid systems is growing fast. The papers <ref> [50, 12, 40, 18] </ref> study 89 models where several items are produced by a common facility with limited capacity. Some of these items ar produced to stock, others are produced to order. The MTO items have priority over MTS items.
