Abstract: We report on a case study conducted at Dassault Elec-tronique in order to assess the benefits of introducing formal specification and validation in an industrial context, using the ISO Standard VDM Specification Language (VDM-SL) and a commercial toolset marketed by IFAD. The case study is based on a typical example from the terrestrial transportation domain, the door management system of a metro. It focuses on the suitability of the VDM technology for the early software development phases before detailed design, when requirements may be unstable and customer feedback is essential. Particular focus is put on the consistency-checking, animation and early prototyping facilities of the IFAD VDM tools.

Reference-contexts: A number of industrial assessments of the VDM technology have been performed prior to this one, for example, see [6, 2], but these have been in different domains and have not focused on animation and rapid prototyping to the same extent as in this paper. The paper <ref> [1] </ref> discusses the use of animation as a complement to formal proof. Acknowledgments We would like to thank Peter Gorm Larsen (IFAD) and members of the SPECTRUM consortium for discussions concerning this work. Peter Gorm Larsen commented on a draft of the paper.

Reference-contexts: D.E. found that the most surprising aspect of the case study was the ease of learning to master VDM, which took less than a week.

Reference-contexts: Section 3.3 shows that animation used in this way was very valuable for detecting errors in the VDM model presented above. The VDM animator provides specific test support through test coverage and test statistics facilities. In addition to animation, the IFAD VDM tools provide a Dynamic Link facility <ref> [4] </ref>, which supports that binary code is executed together with the VDM model.

Throughout the presentation below we use the ASCII notation for VDM-SL which engineers tend to find more attractive than the mathematical notation. Both notations are part of the ISO Standard <ref> [7] </ref>. State and Type Definitions The VDM-SL specification is centered around a Metro state with three variables modeling time, the train and the doors. Initially, at time zero, the train is stopped and the doors are open.

Reference-contexts: This excerpt shows how the clock is used for the three seconds warning. The mu-expression is used for updating a particular field of a record. 3.2 Animation and Prototyping By animation we understand the execution of specifications. The IFAD VDM tools <ref> [8] </ref> provide an animator which is an integrated interpreter and debugger. Animation can be used with standard testing techniques for analyzing specifications before implementing them. Section 3.3 shows that animation used in this way was very valuable for detecting errors in the VDM model presented above.

Reference-contexts: The work reported here was performed in the EU funded SPECTRUM project (ESPRIT project no. 23173) which studied the feasibility of combining B and VDM and integrating two toolkits supporting these formal methods <ref> [10] </ref>. While some French authorities encourage the use of the B method, D.E. engineers find that B does not meet their needs early in the software development process, when requirements are often changing and may need to be clarified and agreed upon by customers.
