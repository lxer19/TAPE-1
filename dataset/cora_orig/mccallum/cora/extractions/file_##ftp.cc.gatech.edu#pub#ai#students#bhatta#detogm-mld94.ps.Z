Abstract: Analogical reasoning plays an important role in design. In particular, cross-domain analogies appear to be important in innovative and creative design. However, making cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions useful in adapting past designs. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from design experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. In this paper, we describe how structure-behavior-function models of designs in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences. In particular, we describe the model-based learning method with a scenario of learning of feedback mechanism.

Reference-contexts: In the IDEAL project, 1 we have been exploring these issues and hypotheses in the context of analogical design of physical devices such as simple electric circuits, electronic circuits with operational amplifiers, and heat exchangers. We have earlier described elsewhere <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1993) </ref> how IDEAL can learn the generic mechanism of cascading from design experiences in analogical design.

Reference-contexts: First is the issue of relevancethe issue of deciding what to generalize from an experience. In this regard, the existing machine learning methods such as pure induction over design experiences could potentially become complex. We have argued elsewhere <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1994) </ref> that there is a need for more effective and efficient learning methods in design. We represent in design experiences a designer's comprehension of how devices work (i.e., how the structure of a design results in its output behaviors).

Reference-contexts: Case-Specific SBF Models IDEAL's models of specific devices are represented in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. These models are borrowed from KRITIK system (Goel, 1989) which are based on a component-substance ontology <ref> (Bylander, 1991) </ref> and derived from the functional representation scheme (Sembugamoorthy & Chandrasekaran, 1986; Chandrasekaran, Goel, & Iwasaki, 1993). In this ontology, the structure of a device is viewed as constituted of components and substances. Substances have locations in reference to the components in the device.

Reference-contexts: In some earlier work on case-based design, generic teleological mechanisms (GTMs), such as cascading, feedback, and feedforward, have been proposed as one type of abstract knowledge that designers might use in adapting design cases <ref> (Goel, 1989) </ref>. GTMs are teleological because they result 1 in specific functions and are generic because they are case independent. <p> Case-Specific SBF Models IDEAL's models of specific devices are represented in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models.

Reference-contexts: KRITIK <ref> (Goel, 1991) </ref>. That is, they are limited to the retrieval of design cases from the same domain as a given problem, and to making small and simple `tweaks' to the retrieved design to fit the specifications of the given problem. In contrast, we are interested in cross-domain analogies in design.

Reference-contexts: Analogies can be of different types: within-problem, cross-problem but within-domain (in short, within-domain), and cross-domain. Much of the existing work in analogical design was in the framework of case-based reasoning and has focused on within-domain analogies, e.g., the earlier versions of STRUPLE <ref> (Maher & Zhao, 1987) </ref> and fl This work has been supported by NSF (research grant IRI-92-10925), ONR (research contract N00014-92-J-1234), Northern Telecom (research gift), and ARPA.
