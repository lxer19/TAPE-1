Reference: [HaDa77] <author> D. Hammerstrom and E. Davidson, </author> <title> "In 1 formation Content of CPU Memory Referencing Behavior", </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Symposium on Computer Architecture, </booktitle> <pages> pages 272-285, </pages> <month> (march </month> <year> 1977). </year>
Reference-contexts: This difference has made it necessary to reduce the off chip width of both the address and data streams, thereby increasing the amount of data that can be transferred without increasing the number of pins used. Previous studies done by Hammerstrom and Davidson <ref> [HaDa77] </ref> imply that the address reference stream contains little information due to locality. Work done by Farrens and Park has shown that it is possible, and feasible to reduce the address width, through base register caching (DBRC) [FaPa91]. Figure 4 shows a diagram of DBRC.

Figure 4 shows a diagram of DBRC. <p> A preliminary idea that is being tested is to spilt the different streams along these lines. Each data section will then be sent as an index, as in a DBRC <ref> [FaPa91] </ref>. In some cases were there is little redundancy in the data the actual raw data will have to be sent uncompressed.
