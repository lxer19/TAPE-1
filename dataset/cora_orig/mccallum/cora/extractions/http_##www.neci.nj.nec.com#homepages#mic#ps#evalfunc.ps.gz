Title: An Evaluation Function for Othello Based on Statistics

Abstract: This paper describes the evaluation function of one of today's strongest Othello programs | LOGISTELLO. The function is based on statistical analysis of a large set of example game positions and profits from ideas regarding pattern value estimation, determination of feature weights, and the fast approximation of time consuming evaluation features.

Reference-contexts: approaches have been used: * Mitchell (1984) labels Othello positions with the game result in the form of the disc-difference and performs a linear regression. * Lee & Mahajan (1988) use a quadratic discriminant function assuming the features to be multivariate normal within the win and loss class. * In <ref> (Buro 1994,1995) </ref> evaluation functions are described in the statistical framework of generalized linear models and logistic regression is used for pa rameter estimation. These approaches give the evaluation function a game phase independent meaning. <p> These approaches give the evaluation function a game phase independent meaning. This is important if the evaluation function depends on the game phase and positions from different phases have to be compared 6 An extensive pattern comparison can be found in <ref> (Buro 1994) </ref>. (e.g. selective extensions, reductions, or choosing open-ing book lines). Mitchell's evaluation function estimates the disc-difference at the end of the game, whereas Lee & Mahajan's quadratic discriminant function and logistic regression model the winning probability. <p> It turned out that the weight vectors determined by logistic regression led to the strongest tournament program. A detailed description of these experiments can be found in <ref> (Buro 1994, 1995) </ref>. Implementation Aspects In game-tree search there is a tradeoff between the evaluation function's quality and its computation time. Thus, it is very important to implement the function as efficient as possible once it has been chosen.
