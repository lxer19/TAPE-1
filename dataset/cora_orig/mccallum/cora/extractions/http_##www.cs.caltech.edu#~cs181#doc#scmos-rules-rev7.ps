Reference-contexts: In this revision, 6 new layers are added starting from layer number 21. * CVP (layer 21) is used to indicate high-voltage p-type area. More comprehensive information can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. * CVN (layer 22) is used to indicate high-voltage p-type area. * COP (layer 23) is used to indicate substrate pit opening area for MEMS devices. * CPS (layer 24) is used to indicate substrate p + etching-stop area for MEMS devices. * CCC (layer 25) is used for generic

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 SCMOS Design Rules This document defines the official layout design rules for MOSIS scalable CMOS (SCMOS) design technology. It supercedes all previous revisions. In SCMOS technology, circuit geometries are drawn according to Mead and Conway's -based methodology <ref> [3] </ref>. The unit of measurement, , can easily be scaled to different fabrication processes as semiconductor technology advances.

In GDS II format, a mask layer is specified by a layer number between 0 and 63. MOSIS now reserves layers numberd from 21 to 62 for mask specification and future extension. Layers defined out of this range can be used by customers for their own purpose.
