Abstract: The system style of expert systems (ES) has been identified as a major reason why ES have found limited acceptance. The capturing of expert knowledge is an arduous task. If presentation of the knowledge is inappropriate it becomes a wasted resource. One way of recapitalising the investment made is to change the interaction style. The ability to perform 'what-if' analysis was seen as a desirable feature offered by many decision support system (DSS). This study has adapted an existing ES without alteration to the knowledge base to perform in a DSS manner, giving the user greater control. The general principles and methods uncovered are described. The study suggests that other forms of reuse may also be possible. The static nature of the traditional expert system consultation often does not meet the requirements of flexibility and high user control demanded by decision makers (Baroff et al 1988, p.100, Clancey 1992, p,28 and Salle and Hunter (1990). Langlotz and Shortliffe (1983) show that even where the knowledge is accurate and reliable, the expertise captured becomes an underutilised and wasted resource if the knowledge can not be accessed by the user in an acceptable way. This observation was made concerning a medical diagnostic system, ONCOCCIN. It became necessary to alter the system style of ONCOCCIN from a consultation system to a critiquing system. The original system gave a recommendation which the physicians had to override and justify if they did not accept the systems advice. This was frustrating and time-consuming. The adapted critiquing system let the physician enter their proposed solution and only queried the user if the system solution was markedly different. The expert system became like another physician that the human could discuss the diagnosis with. A common practise in the medical field. The project reported here involves a viticulture ES, AusVit which advises grape growers whether to spray for various grape diseases and pests. In addition to use of the system in the original answer-conclusion mode, the vineyard manager needed to be able to reason about various possible worlds in order to plan. This required a higher degree of user control and flexibility not offered by

Reference-contexts: There may be a range of other system styles that can be applied to suit different users and decision situations using the same expert knowledge. These styles may include critiquing systems that advise discrepancies in conclusions reached by the system and by the user/expert <ref> (Langlotz and Shortliffe 1983) </ref>, a 'proactive' system, which dynamically informs the user of the need to act on a problem situation or use of the knowledge-base for tutoring or hypothesis testing.
