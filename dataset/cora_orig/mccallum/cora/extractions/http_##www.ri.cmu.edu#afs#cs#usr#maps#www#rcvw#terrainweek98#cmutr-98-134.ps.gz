Abstract: This report defines the CMU MAPSLab Site Exchange Format. This exchange format serves as a system independent method for import and export of three dimensional object descriptions to and from non-CMU systems. The Site Exchange Format supports road models, surface models, constraint models, and several types of building models. This report also describes an application programmers interface to support this exchange format. This API has been implemented to allow users access to all components of the site model interchange structures, or any subset, for integration into any user's particular internal representation for object models. This work was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract DACA76-95-C-0009 monitored by the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, Fort Belvoir, VA. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, or the United States Government.
