Abstract: We develop a polynomial time Monte-Carlo algorithm for estimating the number of solutions to a multivariate polynomial over GF (2). This gives the first efficient method for estimating the number of points on algebraic varieties over GF (2), the problem recently proven to be #P complete even for the cubic polynomials. The number of applications of the result has been also discussed. fl Supported in part by the DFG Grant KA 673/4-1, and by the SERC Grant GR-E 68297.

Reference-contexts: The success of our method has depended on a special property of the GF <ref> [2] </ref> field,and its connection to the other boolean counting problem. <p> As of now these estimation problems are intractable, and also of paramount importance in algebra and algebraic geometry. Another important question is about existence of (*; 0)-approximation algorithms for counting the number of solutions of GF <ref> [2] </ref> (and GF [q]) multivariate polynomials. Any such an algorithm will allow deterministic polynomial time simulation of Monte Carlo (XOR,AND) depth 2 circuits. Acknowledgement We are indebted to Gunter Harder for the algebraic motivation of the problem, and to Dick Karp and Volker Strassen for the interesting discussions.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding problem for DNF -formulas was proven to have 2 log O (1) n time algorithm [9]. The computational complexity of computing exactly the number of solutions of a multivariate GF (2)-polynomial has been resolved only recently. In <ref> [4] </ref> it has been proved that the problem is #P complete. In fact it has been proved ([4]) that the problem is #P complete even when restricted to cubic polynomials. <p> fact it has been proved (<ref> [4] </ref>) that the problem is #P complete even when restricted to cubic polynomials. The degree 3 is the sharp bound for intactability of exact counting for polynomials- as an O (n 3 )-time algorithm has been designed for this problem for polynomials of degree 2 [4]. In this paper we develop the first polynomial time Monte Carlo (*; ffi)-approximation algorithm (cf. [5, 6]) for the problem of counting the number of solutions and satisfying assignments of a multivariate polynomial over GF (2). <p> The GF (2) problem is to compute the number of assignments jGj that satisfy this equation given a description of g and the value of a. 1 Computing jGj exactly is known to be #P complete <ref> [4] </ref>. We develop Monte Carlo algorithms A 0 and A 1 for estimating jGj when a = 0 and a = 1, respectively. The analysis of the two algorithms, excluding the portion that relies on previous work, are very similar.

Reference-contexts: Also ,several recent randomised designs of parallel algorithms over GF (q) raised the question on relative power of randomisation, and the existence of probability estimation methods in the algebraic circuits (there have been some progress along this line for boolean circuits in basis (AND,OR,NOT), (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). Some very special counting problems, like counting the order of elliptic curve over finite fields or the number of rational points on the Jacobian of a curve of genus 2 over finite fields have been proved to have polynomial time algorithms ([11, 1, 2]). <p> In particular, there are no known subexponential determ. time algorithms for approximating the number of solutions of a multivariate polynomial over GF (2). The corresponding problem for DNF -formulas was proven to have 2 log O (1) n time algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>. The computational complexity of computing exactly the number of solutions of a multivariate GF (2)-polynomial has been resolved only recently. In [4] it has been proved that the problem is #P complete.
