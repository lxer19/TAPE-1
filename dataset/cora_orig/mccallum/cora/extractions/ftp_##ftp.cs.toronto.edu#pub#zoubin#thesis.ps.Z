Reference-contexts: If the Gaussians are normalized to account for the variances, and the priors 1 ; 2 ; are normalized to satisfy probability constraints, then a global computation of the partition function is unnecessary as it does not depend on the parameters. Therefore, unlike the Boltzmann machine <ref> (Ackley et al., 1985) </ref>, an unclamped phase of learning is unnecessary. A discussion of fast single-phase learning in this and associated models with constant partition functions can be found in (Neal, 1992) and (Ghahramani, 1995). The E step of the algorithm computes the expected log likelihood of the parameters.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, evidence from patients with damage to this area indicates severe deficits in pointing, reaching and related spatial tasks involving visuomotor coordinate transformations <ref> (for a review see Andersen, 1987) </ref>. What do the results of our study imply for the neural representation of the vi-suomotor transformation? We find that changes in the mapping at one location generalize to other locations in visual space. <p> Let us speculate that the visuomotor transformation is indeed computed largely by neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Our findings are consistent with the response properties of these neurons, which have receptive fields spanning on the order of 60 ffi of the visual field <ref> (Andersen, 1987) </ref>. We further find that a single point in visual space can be remapped in two different directions depending on the starting point of the movement.

Reference-contexts: Barlow's (1989) criterion of minimal redundancy, or maximal independence, has proven difficult to implement in a neurally-plausible learning rule. However, the closely related criterion of maximal de-correlation can be approximated by the combination of a Hebbian feedforward rule and an anti-Hebbian lateral inhibition rule <ref> (Barlow & Foldiak, 1989) </ref>. Foldiak (1990) has found that this rule can form sparse representations, and, like the Linsker model, can predict some interesting receptive field properties of neurons in the early visual pathway.

Reference-contexts: The particular remapping that is chosen by the visuomotor control system, as demonstrated by the change in pointing behavior at different positions in the workspace, reflects intrinsic properties of the map <ref> (Bedford, 1989) </ref>. A coordinate transformation such as the visuomotor map can be regarded as a function relating one set of variables (inputs) to another (outputs). <p> Bedford concluded that learning between perceptual dimensions was constrained to generalize linearly <ref> (Bedford, 1989) </ref>. In the current study, we report results for a two-dimensional pointing task. <p> As the task places no constraints at the non-training targets, the pattern of generalization obtained is a result of intrinsic constraints on the representation of the visuomotor mapping <ref> (Bedford, 1989, 1993) </ref>. Several possible patterns of generalization arise from different hypotheses (Figure 4-1). If the limited exposure at the central training point is insufficient to produce any adaptive effect then no change in pointing behavior would be expected. <p> A random search strategy such as Bedford's, where subjects were told "try moving your hand back and forth slowly" <ref> (Bedford, 1989) </ref> could not be employed since in a two-dimensional workspace it is not guaranteed to locate the target. During this exposure phase the time to place the finger on target was recorded as a measure of visuomotor learning of the training target. <p> The results suggest that training at one point has a non-linear generalization effect; that is, the changes are not uniform across the workspace. Based on this finding one would expect that training at two points might result in a pattern of generalization not consistent with Bedford's linear constraint hypothesis <ref> (Bedford, 1989, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These movements were performed in the dark. In distinction to Bedford's study, where subjects were asked to "point so that it feels like your right eye, the tip of your finger, and the light in space are lined up" <ref> (Bedford, 1993) </ref>, we instructed subjects to place their finger as accurately as possible at the exact location where they saw each target, thus matching both direction and distance. The change in pointing behavior in the absence of visual feedback is a measure of the prismatic aftereffect. <p> Experiment 2: Visuomotor Generalization to a Two-Point Displacement 101 significant global changes in the pointing behavior. It is important to note that as subjects were both uninformed and unaware of the perturbation the adaptation can be regarded as perceptual rather than cognitive <ref> (Bedford, 1993) </ref>. For the x-shift group the large shift in the compensatory direction at the training point indicates a substantial local aftereffect (47%) due to the exposure. <p> However, there are many other possible patterns of generalization consistent with the perturbation; for example, a counterclockwise rotation about the central target or a skew transform. Both of these patterns of generalization are linear transformations of Cartesian space <ref> (see discussion of possible transformations in Bedford, 1993) </ref>. 4.4.1 Method Subjects 16 naive right-handed undergraduate students participated in this study. Subjects were paid $7.00 for participation. All subjects had self-reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Procedure Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control and y-shift.

Reference-contexts: Learning Coordinate Transformations through Mutual Information 5.2.2 Information Theory The idea of extracting common information from different sensory modalities can be phrased succinctly in the language of information theory. Information is defined as the capacity for a signal to reduce a system's uncertainty <ref> (Cover and Thomas, 1991) </ref>. Let n be the number of possible codes for the signal, and p j be the probability of code j.

Reference-contexts: In these models adaptation generally occurs through tuning of the parameters (e.g. Harris, 1965). Parametric models imply global generalization with the form of the generalization depending on the parameter that is altered. Thus, changes in the felt direction of gaze <ref> (e.g. Craske, 1967) </ref> or in felt head position (Lackner, 1973) should generalize over the whole workspace, whereas proprioceptive changes at particular loci of the arm should generalize to particular arm configurations and not others (Prablanc et al., 1975). The results from our experiments, however, do not support the 4.7.

Reference-contexts: Many previous studies have investigated the effects of altered visual feedback using either optical devices such as prisms or visual feedback on a computer monitor separate from actual hand position <ref> (e.g. Cunningham, 1989) </ref>. We could not easily use an optical system, such as a prism, to perturb the visual feedback of the actual arm as it was necessary for our experiments to have rapid position-dependent control of the nature and direction of the perturbation.

Reference-contexts: Previous approaches to mutual information have found this method prohibitively slow, even for accelerated methods such as conjugate gradient descent (G.E. Hinton and P. Dayan, personal communication). We derive an alternative learning algorithm for this architecture based on the EM algorithm <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>. The EM algorithm relies on the natural separation of variables into observables, the inputs x i , and hidden variables, the representations z i . If we assume that the model parameters are correct, the hidden variables can often be easily estimated.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, both these theories rely on a process of mapping or correlation between visual and arm configuration signals for calibration. While the conditions (e.g. Held and Hein, 1958), components (e.g. Harris, 1965; Redding and Wallace, 1988) and time course of adaptation <ref> (e.g. Dewar, 1970) </ref> have been extensively characterized, less is known about the topological properties of the visuomotor map.

Reference-contexts: For the examples in this chapter, these expectations were evaluated exactly. For m modalities, each with a having k-element hidden vector, the exact E step is an O (k m ) computation. More efficient approximations can be obtained using Gibbs sampling <ref> (Geman and Geman, 1984) </ref>, and mean field theory (Parisi, 1988). The M step of the algorithm uses the expectations calculated in the E step to estimate a new set of parameters.

Based on this dissociation, we suggest that the CNS may try to reconcile movement direction or distance when presented with conflicting information about target location.

Reference-contexts: sensorimotor integration model can be tested in both patients with sensory neuropathies, who lack proprioceptive reafference, and in patients with damage to the cerebellum, a proposed site for the forward model (Miall et al., 1993). 3.3 Appendix A: Paradigm The experimental setup consisted of a planar virtual visual feedback system <ref> (described in Wolpert, Ghahramani, and Jordan, 1995) </ref> in conjunction with a planar two degree-of-freedom torque-motor-driven manipulandum (described in Faye, 1986; see The manipulandum was used to accurately measure the position of the subject's thumb and also, using the torque motors, to apply forces to the hand. <p> Therefore, unlike the Boltzmann machine (Ackley et al., 1985), an unclamped phase of learning is unnecessary. A discussion of fast single-phase learning in this and associated models with constant partition functions can be found in (Neal, 1992) and <ref> (Ghahramani, 1995) </ref>. The E step of the algorithm computes the expected log likelihood of the parameters. Like in the Boltzmann machine, this amounts to calculating the first and second order statistics, hz 1 i c , hz 1 i c , and hz 1 z T 2 i c .

Although shown to be of theoretical importance, the existence and use of an internal forward model in the CNS is still a major topic of debate.

Reference-contexts: Two classes of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism for adaptation|sensory hypotheses <ref> (e.g. Harris, 1965) </ref> and sensorimotor hypotheses such as the reafference hypothesis of Held and colleagues (Held, 1962; Held and Hein, 1958). <p> This suggests that the effect is not local but that the global effect decreases further away from the body (Figure 4-8c). Taken together, the y-shift and x-shift data are not consistent with a model that represents the learning as a change in felt direction of gaze <ref> (Harris, 1965) </ref>. Due to the arrangement of the chinrest and table, the subjects' eyes are sagittally away from (35 cm) and above (25 cm) the position of the training point. <p> Thus, the motor coordinates can be represented as a function of the visual coordinates parametrized by the felt configuration of the eyes, head, and arm. In these models adaptation generally occurs through tuning of the parameters <ref> (e.g. Harris, 1965) </ref>. Parametric models imply global generalization with the form of the generalization depending on the parameter that is altered. Thus, changes in the felt direction of gaze (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Serious computational modeling of the role of information theory in the formation of neural representations did not start until Linsker (1986a,b,c). His model consisted of a multilayered network of units with spatially-localized receptive fields, in which learning took place via a Hebbian rule <ref> (Hebb, 1949) </ref>. (The Hebb rule states that synaptic strengths in the brain change in proportion to the correlation of the firing of pre- and post-synaptic neurons.) When a pattern with no spatial or temporal correlations was input to the lowest level of this network, the higher levels would form successively more

Neural network models fall into the general class of function approximation models that are parametrized by a large number of parameters (e.g. the weights in a neural network) that do not necessarily correspond to the physical parameters of the system.

Similarly by predicting the sensory outcome of the action, without actually performing it, a forward model can be used in mental practice to learn to select between possible actions (Sutton and Barto, 1981).

Reference-contexts: this chapter provide direct evidence for the existence and use of such an internal model. 3.2 Experiment: Propagation of Errors in Senso rimotor Integration The notion of an internal model, a system which mimics the behavior of a natural process, has emerged as an important theoretical concept in motor control <ref> (Jordan, 1995) </ref>. There are two varieties of internal models|"forward models," which mimic the causal flow of a process by predicting its next state given the current state and the motor command, and "inverse models," which are anticausal, estimating the motor command that causes a particular state transition. <p> sensorimotor integration model can be tested in both patients with sensory neuropathies, who lack proprioceptive reafference, and in patients with damage to the cerebellum, a proposed site for the forward model (Miall et al., 1993). 3.3 Appendix A: Paradigm The experimental setup consisted of a planar virtual visual feedback system <ref> (described in Wolpert, Ghahramani, and Jordan, 1995) </ref> in conjunction with a planar two degree-of-freedom torque-motor-driven manipulandum (described in Faye, 1986; see The manipulandum was used to accurately measure the position of the subject's thumb and also, using the torque motors, to apply forces to the hand.

Reference-contexts: Information-theoretic Unsupervised Learning 133 the retina sense corresponding patches of space, or that the environment consists of a few translationally invariant objects. A generative model in speech may specify that signals are generated from a small set of underlying units (phonemes) constrained to transition according to a Markov chain <ref> (e.g. Juang and Rabiner, 1991) </ref>. Starting from this generative model, the learning problem consists of estimating the parameters of the model that best fit the data. This fit is generally measured by the likelihood of the data given the parameters, which can be maximized as a function of the parameters.

Reference-contexts: Maximizing the mutual information between two modalities therefore corresponds to maximizing the information transmitted in each modality while maximizing predictability between their outputs. 1 Becker & Hinton (1992) applied their algorithm to the problem of discovering disparity from random-dot stereograms <ref> (Julesz, 1971) </ref>. The model consisted of two modules, each a neural network, which received inputs from corresponding patches from the two eyes. The mutual information criterion was used to derive gradient descent rules for adjusting the weights in the networks.

Reference-contexts: To establish this conclusion we have developed an explicit model of the sensorimotor integration process which contains as special cases all three of the methods referred to above (see Appendix B of this chapter). The model|a Kalman filter <ref> (Kalman and Bucy, 1961) </ref>|is a linear dynamical system that produces an estimate of the location of the hand by monitoring both the motor outflow and the feedback as sensed, in the absence of vision, solely by proprioception.

Reference-contexts: From early visual, somatosensory, and auditory areas, to multisensory areas such as the colliculus and parietal cortex, neurons are arranged with their receptive fields forming topographic maps of the input space <ref> (Kandel et al., 1991) </ref>. In multisensory areas, these topographic maps coincide, making transformation between the different coordinate frames possible. In the superior colliculus, for example, maps of visual and auditory space are aligned with the motor map for producing saccadic eye movements (Sparks and Nelson, 1987).

In function approximation, there is an explicit correspondence between the representation used and the patterns of generalization that will emerge.

Parametric models imply global generalization with the form of the generalization depending on the parameter that is altered. Thus, changes in the felt direction of gaze (e.g. Craske, 1967) or in felt head position <ref> (Lackner, 1973) </ref> should generalize over the whole workspace, whereas proprioceptive changes at particular loci of the arm should generalize to particular arm configurations and not others (Prablanc et al., 1975). The results from our experiments, however, do not support the 4.7.

Reference-contexts: As we have seen, the visual receptive fields of PPC neurons are modulated by body configuration signals such as eye position, head position, and body orientation. Furthermore, a large portion of PPC cells also display activity related to joint configuration and active arm movement <ref> (Mountcastle et al., 1975) </ref>. It is plausible then, if the visuomo-tor map were represented in PPC, that the context of the movement, as indexed by the initial configuration and direction of arm movement, could naturally modulate it.

Reference-contexts: Using Shannon's coding theorem (Shannon, 1948), the MDL cost function can be shown to be equal to the posterior probability of the parameters given the data. In the statistical physics framework, the environment and the learner are a combined system that can occupy many different states <ref> (for a text on statistical physics, see Parisi, 1988) </ref>. The states correspond to patterns of sensory data in the environment and internal representations in the learner. An energy is associated with each combination of states in the environment and learner. <p> For the examples in this chapter, these expectations were evaluated exactly. For m modalities, each with a having k-element hidden vector, the exact E step is an O (k m ) computation. More efficient approximations can be obtained using Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), and mean field theory <ref> (Parisi, 1988) </ref>. The M step of the algorithm uses the expectations calculated in the E step to estimate a new set of parameters.

Reference-contexts: Function approximators span a range of possible generalization patterns as measured by the behavior of the system when tested on novel inputs. Conversely, the generalization properties of a function approximator can be used to infer the internal representation of the function <ref> (Sanger, 1994) </ref>. Therefore, the issues of representation and generalization are intertwined in function approximation theory. At one extreme, a function approximator can be represented as a look-up table in which corresponding input-output pairs are stored (Atkeson, 1989; Rosenbaum et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: For example, a two-dimensional map (e.g. inter-aural time difference (ITD) and interaural intensity difference (IID)) may be mapped onto a one-dimensional continuum (location in azimuth) in another modality. More esoteric structures, such as the helical structure of perceived tones revealed by similarity judgements <ref> (Shepard, 1982) </ref>, may also be induced through combinations of circular and linear topologies. The algorithm can be extended to more than two modalities by use of the n-channel generalization of mutual information (5.9).

Reference-contexts: In multisensory areas, these topographic maps coincide, making transformation between the different coordinate frames possible. In the superior colliculus, for example, maps of visual and auditory space are aligned with the motor map for producing saccadic eye movements <ref> (Sparks and Nelson, 1987) </ref>. This alignment allows the disparate representations of visual and auditory inputs to be mapped into a common motor representation. In this chapter we propose an extension of the mutual information criterion for multisensory integration that incorporates topographic constraints.

Reference-contexts: After the experiments, subjects were explained the nature of the perturbation and asked whether they had noticed it; none reported having noticed it. Furthermore, as the shifts were measured in the absence of the visual stimulus, they can be considered aftereffects in analogy to the prism adaptation literature <ref> (Welch, 1978) </ref>. Taken together, the presence of significant aftereffects and subjects' unawareness of the perturbation can be taken as evidence that the shifts found were true adaptation and not the result of conscious strategies or "cognitive learning" (Redding and Wallace, 1993; Bedford, 1993). <p> It is hard to evaluate these results, as there is no reason the sensory system could interpret these signals as variable signals from one locus, rather than signals from many fixed loci or one moving locus|it is therefore not clear that the sensory system had any cue for rearrangement <ref> (Welch, 1978) </ref>. In the following experiment subjects were exposed to a randomly-varying displacement between the visual and auditory locations of visuo-auditory stimuli. <p> Subsequently, many studies have further demonstrated the remarkable ability of subjects to adapt, at least partially, to a wide variety of alterations in the relationship between visual and motor system <ref> (for reviews see Welch, 1978 and Howard, 1982) </ref>|the single prerequisite for adaptation seems to be that the remapping be stable (Welch, 1986). Two classes of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism for adaptation|sensory hypotheses (e.g.
