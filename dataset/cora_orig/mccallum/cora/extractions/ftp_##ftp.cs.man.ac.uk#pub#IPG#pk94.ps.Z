Abstract: Role Activity Diagrams (RADs) originated through the study of coordination by Anatol Holt [Hol83]. They have of course been well described in IOPener before now [Oul92]. This article is a collection of observations based upon the authors use of RADs in work with insurance underwriters and software developers. Although intuitively simple and easy to read, RADs are a powerful modelling technique which use a number of notational primitives to express very complex process behaviour. In simple terms, the harder you work RADs the more you can express with them. In order to be clear about the purpose to which RADs are put we can borrow some ideas from the software process research community. Dowson and Fernstrom [DF94] usefully identify different process domains: The domain of process definitions which contains characterizations of processes or fragments of processes, expressed in some notation, in terms of how they could or should be performed. Therefore this is the domain of RADs, Data Flow Diagrams and other graphical notations. It is also the domain of process modelling languages (PMLs) which are ..definitions that are enactable. The domain of process performance which encompasses the actual activities or actions conducted by human agents. This is the domain of the workplace, where people carry out a range of activities which may or may not involve the use of technology and may or may not conform to a process definition. To these two domains we can add a third; the domain of process support. This is concerned with the services that take place in IT systems to support and enable the greater process performance 1 . RADs can be used to describe an existing process performance in order that it can be better understood, analysed and changed. A new pattern of process performance which results can itself be modelled and changed. Thus, ever since the first version of our process modelling method [Kaw92] right through to our current SERC funded work [Rob93], the Informatics Process Group have emphasised that process modelling can be as continuous as the management function itself. Process support can be seen as a system within and contributing to the greater system of process performance. RADs can be used to help understand the relationship between an existing support system and process performance. They can contribute to the development of a support system or a more general performance and to an appreciation of the implications of this development. Figure 1 is an expression of the interdependence of a process and its support. Changes which are made to a process performance may affect that part of it which is in the domain of the support system. The converse is also true. Therefore the purpose to which we set RAD modelling, and indeed process modelling more generally, is to do with understanding and managing the relationships between systems (existing support, exist 1. This third domain differs from that proposed by Dowson and Fernstrom. They suggest a domain of process definition enactment which is concerned with what takes place in a process centred support environment to support process definition-governed process performance. For the purposes of this article this was thought to be restrictive . We can think of process definition enactment as contributing to the more general domain of process support.
