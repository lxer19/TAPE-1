Title: P-Cyclic SOR for Markov Chains  
Author: Kimon Kontovasilis Robert J. Plemmons William J. Stewart 
Date: August 9, 1996  
Abstract: The block SOR method for the computation of the steady state distribution of finite Markov chains that possess p-cyclic infinitesimal generators is considered. It is shown that convergence, in a sense more general than the usual, may be obtained even if the SOR iteration matrix violates the usual conditions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence in this, extended, sense are derived. Exact convergence intervals and the optimal ! values are given. In addition to the "usual" optimal ! in the interval (1; p p1 ), other ! values, that yield convergence in the extended sense, are found to achieve the same, optimal, convergence rate. Numerical tests indicate that small perturbations of ! around the optimal value affect the convergence factor much less, if these newly introduced optimal ! values are used.

Reference-contexts: Then, the matrix ^ J = ^ D 1 ^ L + ^ U (15) is an irreducible cyclic stochastic matrix with period (index) p. Indeed, since Q is a singular M -matrix, ^ D ii i = 1; : : : ; p are nonsingular M -matrices <ref> [2, p. 156, theorem 4.16] </ref> and, therefore, ^ D 1 ii exist and are strictly positive [2, p. 141, theorem 2.7]. Since ( ^ L + ^ U) is nonnegative (as nondiagonal part of an infinitesimal generator), we conclude that ^ J = ^ D 1 i j is nonnegative. <p> Indeed, since Q is a singular M -matrix, ^ D ii i = 1; : : : ; p are nonsingular M -matrices [2, p. 156, theorem 4.16] and, therefore, ^ D 1 ii exist and are strictly positive <ref> [2, p. 141, theorem 2.7] </ref>. Since ( ^ L + ^ U) is nonnegative (as nondiagonal part of an infinitesimal generator), we conclude that ^ J = ^ D 1 i j is nonnegative. <p> By equations (14) and (15) we immediately get that ^ Je = ^ D 1 ^ L + ^ U e = e which, along with the nonnegativity, proves that ^ J is a stochastic matrix. The irreducibility comes from the fact that Q is an irreducible M -matrix <ref> [2, theorems 4.16 and 4.12] </ref>. Lastly, observe that, by construction, ^ J is cyclic. The period is p for otherwise some of the blocks in ^ J could be partitioned further, or equivalently Q would be k-cyclic for some k &gt; p. <p> By the definition of ff (!) in (28), it is immediate that jA (!)j, the cardinality of A (!), is greater or equal to one. Recall now that, taking into account the fact that 1 2 oe (L ! ) 8!, the usual conditions for semiconvergence (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) become: A1 ae (L ! ) = 1 A2 all elementary divisors associated with the unit eigenvalue are linear, i.e. rank (I L ! ) = rank (I L ! ) 2 A3 if 2 oe (L ! ) with jj = 1, then = 1 Under the light of

Reference-contexts: Following an idea of Courtois and Semal <ref> [5] </ref>, we show that, although the ! parameter may be chosen in a way such that L ! violates the conditions for semiconvergence, sor "converges" to a vector that has subvectors parallel to the corresponding subvectors of the stationary probability vector . <p> The interrelation among the eigenvectors of an irreducible and cyclic stochastic matrix corresponding to eigenvalues of the same cyclic class was observed by Courtois and Semal who proved a theorem, an immediate generalization of which we now state <ref> [5, theorem 1] </ref>: Theorem 2.2 Let T T be of the form (7), similar to a cyclic stochastic matrix with period p. <p> The same proof, however, remains valid for any 6= 0. For the proof see <ref> [5] </ref>. Observe that, since J is of the form (7), by theorem 2.1 we deduct the validity of theorem 2.2 for the right eigenvectors of a cyclic class of J . <p> This new notion of convergence can be viewed as a generalisation of the subvector convergence in the work of Courtois and Semal <ref> [5] </ref>.

In fact this last case is of much more interest in the Markov Chain setting, since, most of the times, Markov Chains yield asymmetric matrices having nonregular spectra.

Reference-contexts: In section 3, by exploiting an idea of Gutknecht <ref> [8] </ref> which has also been used by Wild and Niethammer [21], we introduce a p-step iterative method which employs J and whose convergence is closely related to the sor convergence. <p> Therefore, all the results of the paper carry over, simply by replacing J with P T . 3 The p-step Iteration and conditions for SOR convergence The sor iteration (4) was observed by Gutknecht (see Gutknecht, Niethammer and Varga <ref> [8] </ref>) to be related to the following simpler iteration, when the block Jacobi matrix that is associated with the system (1) has the form (7). <p> We now proceed to make this discussion more concrete by examining the eigensystems of the iteration matrices associated with the p-step iteration and with sor. The p-step relaxation can be transformed to an equivalent first-order relaxation (see Gutknecht, Nietham-mer and Varga <ref> [8] </ref>) r (m) = T r (m1) + !c 00 m = p; p + 1; : : : (22) where &lt; np 3 r (m) = x (m) ; x (m1) ; : : : ; x (mp+1) (23) with the subvectors x (i) being employed in the iteration (19),

Numerical tests indicate that perturbations of ! around the optimal value affect the convergence rate much less if these new optimal values are used. The organization of the paper is as follows. <p> Note also that if we want to restrict ourselves to convergence in the usual sense, only values of ! in the range i p1 are candidates, something consistent with the already known results (e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Wild and Niethammer took a more generic approach in examining the same problem. They showed <ref> [21] </ref> that the convergence of sor and the optimal convergence factor can be determined by examining if the eigenvalues of J lie inside the subset of the complex plane which is bounded by some hypocycloidal curve. <p> This approach permitted them to rederive the results on ! opt mentioned above, as well as exact convergence intervals. The work discussed in this paper follows this same approach. Furthermore, Eiermann, Niethammer and Ruttan [6], extended the work of Wild and Niethammer <ref> [21] </ref>, by treating the case when J p has both positive and negative eigenvalues. <p> In section 3, by exploiting an idea of Gutknecht [8] which has also been used by Wild and Niethammer <ref> [21] </ref>, we introduce a p-step iterative method which employs J and whose convergence is closely related to the sor convergence. <p> In view of the theorem 2.2, we seek to relate the eigensystems of L ! and T with the eigensystem of J. The next two theorems perform this task. Theorem 3.1 (see also <ref> [21] </ref>) The eigenvalues of T are the np zeros of the n polynomials f !; j () j p ! j p1 (1 !); j = 1; : : : ; n, where j ; j = 1; : : : ; n are the n eigenvalues of J . <p> The proof is in appendix C. Having determined the parameter ff (!) as a function of !, we now describe a tool that will be of help in deciding about the validity of condition C1 for some given !. In this task we follow Wild and Niethammer <ref> [21] </ref>. For condition C1 to be valid, for some given !, we require that all eigenvalues of T (the iteration matrix of the p-step method defined in (24)), excluding those related to the eigenvalues of J having modulus unity, have modulus strictly less than ff (!). <p> max = R r + h (45) and the points with minimum modulus occur at angles = 2k+1 p k = 0; : : : ; p 1, with corresponding modulus d min = R r h (46) A more detailed geometric characterization can be found in Wild and Niethammer <ref> [21] </ref>. See figures 1-3 for examples of shortened cusped and stretched hypocycloids. Having dealt with the properties of the hypocycloidal curves, which occur as boundaries of the set U j (!) for ! &gt; 1, we now investigate the boundaries for the other ranges of !. <p> One can view the methods used in sections 5 and 6 as extension of the methods used by Wild and Niethammer <ref> [21] </ref> and Eiermann, Niethammer and Ruttan [6] for the singular homogeneous case. <p> Although we did not treat other cases, besides the one of J p having real nonnegative eigenvalues, it is obvious that the methods described in this paper can be directly used to deal with cases where the eigenvalues of J p are (apart from the unit eigenvalue) nonpositive reals (see <ref> [21] </ref>) or just reals in general (see [6]). In fact this last case is of much more interest in the Markov Chain setting, since, most of the times, Markov Chains yield asymmetric matrices having nonregular spectra.
