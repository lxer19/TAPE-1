Abstract: Multimedia is emerging as a requirement in mission-critical scenarios such as medicine, television studios and video servers. These applications have stringent resource requirements and resources have to be appropriately allocated and monitored to satisfy their users. Furthermore, we require many of these applications to be modifiable while they run, while still meeting their Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. This paper describes how the Djinn framework [MIT97] provides QoS support to reconfigurable distributed multimedia applications by maintaining a runtime model of the application. The model is of the applications structure, QoS characteristics and integrity constraints. To facilitate programming, the model is modular and transparent. We model QoS characteristics as a set of linear relations between attributes of media flows and resources, and apply linear programming techniques to solve them. This approach supports incremental changes to QoS by reusing previous QoS calculations. After describing our methods, the paper relates them to other work and outlines the open issues raised by them.

Reference-contexts: Table 6 shows the solution for this example. Table 7 shows the time taken to perform reconfigurations. It is compared with the time required to solve the same problem with no prior knowledge of the application's QoS requirements. 5.

Other systems, such as Lancaster Universitys QoS-A <ref> [CAM93] </ref>, also provide end-to-end QoS support for individual flows, but not for entire applications, where constraints have to be taken into account.

Reference-contexts: Also, the application components individually attempt to reserve resources during admission control. This can lead to admission failing, even in situations where sufficient resources could be found. The Quorum project <ref> [CHA97] </ref> is developing an adaptive QoS architecture for resource management of distributed real-time systems. They model the structural and QoS characteristics of applications in a Logical Application Stream Model (LASM), and use this model to perform admission control.

Reference-contexts: This would be modelled as a QoS characteristic of the conference composite component. Dynamic reconfiguration of the application is first performed on the model components, in a transactional manner <ref> [MIT98a] </ref>. This allows us to manage concurrent admissions tests, e.g. when two applications are started at the same time in a TV studio.
