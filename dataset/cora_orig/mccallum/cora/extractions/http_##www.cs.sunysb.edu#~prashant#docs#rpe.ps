Abstract: The service discipline implemented by the network and the offered load are important variables determining network performance. An integrated service network is one which implements a single, unified architecture suitable for supporting a wide range of traffic types like guaranteed performance services, bounded delay services and best effort traffic. Such a network implements efficient scheduling and statistical multiplexing to achieve this end. For such a service differentiating network, pricing is of interest from a network engineering perspective in that it leads to more efficient use of the network by shaping the offered load to the network. This paper proposes a scalable architecture for pricing in integrated service communication networks. We discuss the theoretical foundations of pricing a congestible network and apply the developed concepts to an integrated service network that supports a wide range of traffic types. We discuss related work on efficient pricing strategies in the context of specific network architectures and traffic types .We then present a discussion of the architectural issues involved in implementing pricing in a large scale and heterogenous networking infrastructure. We go on to propose an architecture that scales with the size of the network and discuss an adaptive pricing strategy for it. Pricing for multicast connections is then discussed. We conclude with a brief summary.

Reference-contexts: setting values for these prices requires a knowledge of expected traffic patterns depending on the time of day (which entails the assumption that fairly stable patterns do exist and vary over fairly large time periods). 3.2.1 An Iterative Procedure for Pricing in ATM networks A proposal by Wang et al <ref> [Wang] </ref> outlines a procedure which can be used to do dynamic price setting in an integrated services network (viz ATM) based on the time-of-day-dependent call arrival patterns of the various classes. <p> paths. 4 A Scalable Architecture for Implementing Pricing in a Heirar chical Network Related work on pricing has mainly been either of theoretical nature, in the sense of describing the desirable characteristics of a pricing scheme [Varian1] [Shenker1] or, it has considered pricing schemes specific to a problem space [Kelly] <ref> [Wang] </ref> [Murphy]. Moreover, none of the schemes has considered the scale of the problem or the heterogeneity of the problem space possible in a large integrated-service internetwork. The architectural challenge is to apply the developed concepts to a real integrated service internet which is richly interconnected and heterogenous.

Reference-contexts: The best effort packets share a multiplexed buffer B s . If the packet's bid is greater than or equal to the p b (t), it is admitted into this buffer provided buffer space is available and these packets are scheduled either using FIFO or cost based scheduling <ref> [Peha] </ref>. <p> Now, in order to implement service differentiation, the routers should implement appropriate scheduling mechanisms. More generally, the scheduling of a packet should be tied to the service requirements of the packet. The idea of cost-based scheduling <ref> [Peha] </ref> expresses arbitrary performance objectives in the form of cost functions which map the queueing delay experienced by a packet to a cost incurred and schedules packets according to this cost. <p> As alluded to before, there are a lot of service architectures that would fit our framework. We have addressed the utility maximization problem by tying the scheduling of packets with their bids, in an attempt to approximate the cost based scheduling idea in <ref> [Peha] </ref>. Also, we have provided for a mechanism for partitioning and allocating network resources in a way that reflects the current demand (bid distribution). Policy decisions for resource sharing as proposed in [Floyd] may be enforced on top of this simple demand-based allocation.

Reference-contexts: Whether this is acceptable or not and if not, how the resource must be partitioned is largely a policy issue but the scheme nevertheless provides mechanism for it. On top of the basic resource partitioning layer, there can be a policy layer providing some sort of link sharing guidelines <ref> [Floyd] </ref>. The basic link sharing proposal by Floyd et al is to have a pre-determined specification of how a given link's bandwidth will be shared among a heirarchy of classes. To begin with, all traffic is scheduled by a general scheduler which need not enforce any particular link-sharing guidelines. <p> Also, we have provided for a mechanism for partitioning and allocating network resources in a way that reflects the current demand (bid distribution). Policy decisions for resource sharing as proposed in <ref> [Floyd] </ref> may be enforced on top of this simple demand-based allocation.

In <ref> [Varian2] </ref>, they propose an approach that can alleviate this problem. This is the smart market approach based on the Vickrey Auction.

Reference-contexts: The rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 discusses the theory of pricing a congestible resource and formalizes the notion of efficiency <ref> [Shenker1] </ref>. Section 3 discusses related work on developing efficient pricing mechanisms for specific kinds of traffic profiles and network architectures. Section 4 discusses the architectural issues involved in implementing pricing in a large, heterogenous network and discusses a scalable architecture for pricing such an integrated services network. <p> Some of these paradigms are, for instance, reservation based which means that a data flow with reserved resources would be unaffected by externalities caused by other traffic. The work in <ref> [Shenker1] </ref> establishes that it is possible to set prices such that optimal network performance is achieved. <p> In general, as long as we are able to express the effective bandwidth as a concave function of the expectation of a measurable quantity, we can derive a desirable tariff function. 3.2 Pricing Schemes for ATM networks As discussed earlier, the work in <ref> [Shenker1] </ref> proves by simulation that an acceptable and adoptable pricing strategy can be developed for a multi service class network. <p> again tries to converge to an optimum distribution of link bandwidth across virtual paths. 4 A Scalable Architecture for Implementing Pricing in a Heirar chical Network Related work on pricing has mainly been either of theoretical nature, in the sense of describing the desirable characteristics of a pricing scheme [Varian1] <ref> [Shenker1] </ref> or, it has considered pricing schemes specific to a problem space [Kelly] [Wang] [Murphy].

Reference-contexts: The nature of this work is primarily not focused towards a globally optimal pricing strategy and focuses rather on efficient pricing strategies for specific traffic profiles or network architectures. 6 3.1 Effective Bandwidth <ref> [Kelly] </ref> presents a method of charging bursty traffic sources based on their effective bandwidth. The effective bandwidth is a function of the traffic profile (or the arrival distribution) of a source and provides a good measure upon which to base pricing decisions. <p> For instance, for an on/off source, the effective bandwidth would be a function of the peak and mean rates. It has been shown that the notion of effective bandwidth is relevant to issues like network dimensioning and call acceptance control. In <ref> [Kelly] </ref> it has been shown that effective bandwidth is relevant to pricing decisions in a network. <p> The pricing scheme proposed by <ref> [Kelly] </ref> is nice in that it is able to make these tradeoffs explicit. To see under what conditions such prices can be set, take the example of an on/off source with peak rate h and mean rate m. <p> virtual paths. 4 A Scalable Architecture for Implementing Pricing in a Heirar chical Network Related work on pricing has mainly been either of theoretical nature, in the sense of describing the desirable characteristics of a pricing scheme [Varian1] [Shenker1] or, it has considered pricing schemes specific to a problem space <ref> [Kelly] </ref> [Wang] [Murphy]. Moreover, none of the schemes has considered the scale of the problem or the heterogeneity of the problem space possible in a large integrated-service internetwork. The architectural challenge is to apply the developed concepts to a real integrated service internet which is richly interconnected and heterogenous. <p> Exact conformance to the model, however, can be considered desirable for a node implementing integrated service. 4.4 Pricing Guaranteed Service For pricing guaranteed traffic, we use their effective bandwidths as a measure of their resource requirement and charge them in proportion to their effective b/w values. As in <ref> [Kelly] </ref>, the source can be asked to provide, if known, the traffic specification of the flow (for instance, peak and mean rates for bursty sources). Typically, a real-time source making a resource reservation would have information about its traffic parameters. <p> Typically, a real-time source making a resource reservation would have information about its traffic parameters. Even if some or all parameters are not accurately known, as shown in <ref> [Kelly] </ref> and discussed in section 3.1, the source can provide expected values of these parameters. As long as the effective bandwidth can be represented as a concave function of such an expected value (assuming the value is measurable), a desirable pricing schedule can be derived.

Reference-contexts: This process can be iterated till the price schedules for guaranteed services and the spot prices for the best effort service stabilize. 3.2.2 Pricing based on Virtual Path and Link Capacities Another interesting approach to pricing in ATM networks has been given by Murphy et al in <ref> [Murphy] </ref>. They decide on the costs of using the network over a period of time based upon the virtual path and physical link capacities of the network. A virtual path in an ATM network is a collection of connections which are routed collectively between switches. <p> 4 A Scalable Architecture for Implementing Pricing in a Heirar chical Network Related work on pricing has mainly been either of theoretical nature, in the sense of describing the desirable characteristics of a pricing scheme [Varian1] [Shenker1] or, it has considered pricing schemes specific to a problem space [Kelly] [Wang] <ref> [Murphy] </ref>.

The architectural challenge is to apply the developed concepts to a real integrated service internet which is richly interconnected and heterogenous. <p> The scaling factor might also take into account the bid value of the highest bounded delay class, since the highest bounded delay class can be considered as the first 'loser' in the contention for the guaranteed class. The proposal in <ref> [Murphy] </ref> is also interesting in that it discusses pricing in the context of ATM networks and the backbone nodes at high levels of the network heirarchy are expected to be ATM in many cases.
