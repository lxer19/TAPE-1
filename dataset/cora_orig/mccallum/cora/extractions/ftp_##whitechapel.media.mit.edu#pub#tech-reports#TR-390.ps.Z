Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 390 Submitted to: ACM Siggraph Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, Providence, Rhode Island, April 1997 Obsolete by: TR426 Abstract We present a computer vision and virtual reality application for cancer patients. Currently, visualization and imagery techniques are becoming an accepted adjunct in the treatment of cancer. Mounting evidence shows the effectiveness of using self-imagery to encourage the immune system to boost its effort to defend the body from disease. Furthermore, while stress has been shown to retard the immune system, relaxation has the opposite effect. To that end, we are developing a virtual reality visualization tool for cancer patients called Staying Alive. The system provides a means for users to relax while directly visualizing their immune systems fighting off their diseases. White and red blood cells and malignant cells populate the virtual environment. The user navigates a white blood cell through the blood stream and "digests" malignant cells found along the way. To control the virtual environment, the user, free of wires and other such encum-berments, engages the system simply by sitting in a room, practicing T'ai Chi gestures. Computer vision techniques are employed to track the user's head and hands in 3-D and a Hidden Markov Model framework is used to recognize the gestures in real time.

Reference-contexts: A richer representation of the hands, one that includes a true third dimension, allows for the recognition of more sophisticated gestures, such as T'ai Chi gestures. Azarbayejani and Pentland have developed STIVE, a system similar to ALIVE but with two wide baseline cameras, allowing for less noisy depth determination <ref> [1] </ref>. STIVE detects human skin by chrominance value (unaffected by variations in melanin density) and can output 3D head and hand positions to an accuracy of approximately two centimeters at up to 30 frames/sec (see Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: Numerous studies have shown that inducing the "relaxation response" enhances the effectiveness of the immune system while stress retards it [9]. Furthermore, imagery and relaxation have been shown to greatly reduce the stress and anxiety that cancer treatments can cause <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. Because visualization and relaxation promise so much benefit to both those with and without cancer, 1 we are developing a virtual reality visualization tool called Staying Alive.

Reference-contexts: For testing, six examples of each gesture were recorded in the same location as the training, in a translated location, and in a translated and rotated location. It is not in the scope of this paper to fully discuss the selection of feature vectors (see <ref> [3] </ref> for such analysis). However, using the (dx,dy,dz) (delta between frames) locations of the hands and head provides a ninety-eight percent recognition level when the user practices T'ai Chi in the same location as where the training took place.

Reference-contexts: In addition, another interesting extension of this work would be the integration of affective computing, "computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotion" <ref> [7] </ref>. Specifically, Picard discusses the development of emotion recognition by computers, most simply through the use of sensors monitoring physiological responses such as heart rate or blood pressure. There are many issues which complicate the task. <p> There are many issues which complicate the task.

Reference-contexts: T'ai Chi is among the more popular forms of martial arts in China and the world. Though like all martial arts, this exercise includes movements for attack and defense, there are several forms of T'ai Chi which are slow and gentle, such as the Yang, Wu or Sun styles <ref> [14] </ref>. The gestures for this application were chosen from the Yang style, which is meant more for relaxation and wholeness than for fighting. 2 The application: Staying Alive The test-bed in which this project is being developed is the Interactive Virtual Environment (IVE) space.
