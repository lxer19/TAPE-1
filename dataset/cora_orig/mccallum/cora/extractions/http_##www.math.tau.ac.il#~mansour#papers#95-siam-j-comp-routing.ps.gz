Abstract: Scheduling packets to be forwarded over a link is an important subtask of the routing process both in parallel computing and in communication networks. This paper investigates the simple class of greedy scheduling algorithms, namely, algorithms that always forward a packet if they can. It is first proved that for various "natural" classes of routes, the time required to complete the transmission of a set of packets is bounded by the number of packets, k, and the maximal route length, d, for any greedy algorithm (including the arbitrary scheduling policy). Next, tight time bounds of d + k 1 are proved for a specific greedy algorithm on the class of shortest paths in n-vertex networks. Finally it is shown that when the routes are arbitrary, the time achieved by various "natural" greedy algorithms can be as bad as (d x Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot 76100, Israel. peleg@wisdom.weizmann.ac.il.

Reference-contexts: Note that this includes also an algorithm that selects the message to be forwarded next on each link arbitrarily from among the waiting messages (or alternatively, allows an adversary to decide which packet will be sent next). The class of greedy policies is very natural <ref> [Ko78] </ref>, and in fact, all packet scheduling policies used in practical packet switching networks of which we are aware fall in this class. It is interesting to note that the efficient algorithm of [LMR88] is not greedy.

This strengthens the counter-examples given in <ref> [LMR88] </ref> for the case of long routes and a large number of packets. 2 Model We view the communication network as a directed graph, G = (V; E), where an edge (u; v) represents a bidirectional link connecting the processors u and v.
