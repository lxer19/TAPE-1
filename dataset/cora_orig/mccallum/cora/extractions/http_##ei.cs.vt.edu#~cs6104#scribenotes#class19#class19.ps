Reference-contexts: Choosing ff = 5 and fi = 1 gives us the desired result for line 12. Finally, we compute the root b to be 4 5 1 1 which is 17. The analysis of the AMM algorithm is provided by Theorem 7.3.2 in <ref> [1] </ref>. It states that AMM fails with probability 1=r, corresponding to the probability of not selecting a generator in line 2. <p> Also, F p B. Theorem 1 (Theorem 7.4.1 in <ref> [1] </ref>) If a 2 F p [X]=(f ), then a 2 B if and only if each a i 2 F p , for 1 i r. Proof: (a) = (a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a r ).
