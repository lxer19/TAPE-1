Abstract: Universal Stability Results for Greedy Abstract In this paper, we analyze the behavior of communication networks in which packets are generated dynamically at the nodes and routed in discrete time steps across the edges. We focus on a basic adversarial model of packet generation and path determination for which the time-averaged injection rate of packets requiring the use of any edge is limited to be less than 1. A crucial issue that arises in such a setting is that of stability | will the number of packets in the system remain bounded, as the system runs for an arbitrarily long period of time? Among other things, we show: Our results resolve several questions posed by Borodin et al., and provide the first examples of (i) a protocol that is stable for all networks, and (ii) a protocol that is not stable for all networks.

Reference-contexts: In related work, Awerbuch and Leighton <ref> [1] </ref> presented a stable packet-routing algorithm that could be used to provide a local-control approximation for the multicommodity flow problem. The problem of continuous packet injection and routing has also been a major topic of study within the field of queueing theory [12, 11]. <p> The algorithm for the static problem works as follows. First, each packet p is assigned an integer value (p) chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from <ref> [1; ffc log (mcd) ] </ref>, where ff is a (small) constant. Let us define fi = 1 + * and divide the routing time into intervals of fi ff log (mcd) consecutive steps. <p> The contention resolution protocol is then free to route each packet on an arbitrary path to its destination. This model is closer to the setting of the Awerbuch-Leighton multicommodity flow algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>; it would be interesting to investigate these connections further. Acknowledgments We thank Allan Borodin for helpful discussions.

Reference-contexts: Typical assumptions here are that packets are generated according to a Poisson process, and that the time to traverse an edge is an exponentially distributed random variable, rather than a fixed constant. See <ref> [2] </ref> for a review of previous work on these models. In this paper, we work within a model of continuous packet injection proposed by Borodin et al.

In this paper, we work within a model of continuous packet injection proposed by Borodin et al. [2], in which probabilistic assumptions are replaced by worst-case inputs.

The model of [2] considers the time evolution of a packet-routing network as a game between an adversary and a protocol. <p> The protocol is said to be stable against the adversary if there is a constant C (possibly depending on the underlying network) so that there are never more than C unabsorbed packets in the system, regardless of how long the game is played. In this paper, as in <ref> [2] </ref>, we will only consider greedy protocols | those that advance a packet across an edge e whenever there is at least one packet waiting to use e. A crucial parameter of the adversary is its rate. <p> However, the converse direction does not hold: there exist adversaries in the model of Borodin et al. that cannot be captured by the framework of Cruz. (For example, one needs the more general model of <ref> [2] </ref> to represent connections of limited duration.) In recent related work, Rabani and Tardos [16] developed a randomized algorithm for static routing problems, and applied it to dynamic problems. <p> Their algorithm is different from those we consider here in that it is not greedy and it allows packets to be discarded: the algorithm is allowed to pre-emptively remove a packet from the system with inverse polynomial probability. A number of fundamental open questions were raised in <ref> [2] </ref> concerning the relationship between rate and stability. <p> Definition 1.2 We say that protocol P is universally stable if it is stable against every adversary of rate less than 1, on every network. 3 We noted above that <ref> [2] </ref> showed directed acyclic graphs to be universally stable; but for graphs with directed cycles, the following two extremes were both left open as possibilities: (a) every graph is universally stable; or (b) no graph containing a directed cycle is universally stable. <p> It was also left open whether or not any or all greedy protocols are universally stable. 1.1 Our results In this paper, we resolve the open questions of <ref> [2] </ref> described above, and provide additional results on stability. <p> We begin our study with the case of the n-node ring, since it is situated between the class of directed acyclic graphs | which are known to be universally stable by a result of <ref> [2] </ref> | and the simple cyclic graphs of Section 2.2, which are not universally stable. Thus, it is natural to ask whether there is any universally stable network that contains a directed cycle.

Reference-contexts: But it is interesting to study the behavior of protocols against adversaries of rates bounded away from 1. In Section 2.2, we showed that LIFO and NTG can be unstable 16 at any injection rate greater than 0:62; a recent result of Borodin, Kleinberg, Sudan, and Williamson <ref> [3] </ref> shows that there exist adversaries of arbitrarily small positive rates that cause NTG to be unstable.

Reference-contexts: This protocol is derived from a distributed randomized algorithm presented for this problem by Leighton, Maggs, and Rao <ref> [13] </ref>. We will base our dynamic algorithm on this static one. <p> Let first assume that we have a set of N packets to be routed in a network G such that no packet has to traverse a path of more that d edges (dilation) and no edge is in more than c packet paths (congestion). Leighton, Maggs, and Rao <ref> [13] </ref> presented a distributed randomized algorithm that routes all the packets in O (c + d log (N d)) steps, with high probability. Here we slightly modify the parameters of the algorithm so the routing takes (1 + *)c + O (d log (mcd)) steps, for any * &gt; 1.
