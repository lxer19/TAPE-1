Title: Self-Similar Network Traffic: Implications to Real-Time Applications and QoS

Abstract: Recent measurements of network traffic [3, 8] have shown that scale-invariant burstiness|self-similarity| is a ubiquitous phenomenon found in both LANs and WANs as well as many types of traffic including compressed video. In [5], a generic high-level (application layer) causal mechanism was advanced for inducing self-similar link traffic when incorporating the effects of the transport layer. The performance impact was investigated in [4] showing the sensitive dependence of the delay-throughput relation on self-similarity. This paper studies the problem of provisioning quality of service (QoS) to real-time applications in the presence of self-similarity, first, with respect to network design, and second, with respect to congestion control. In the context of network design, two of the principal design variables are bandwidth and buffer capacity. The marginal utility of buffer capacity with respect to QoS provision is low due to the amplified queueing behavior exhibited by self-similar traffic: packet loss rate can only be reduced at a disproportionate increase in queueing delay. Figure 1 (left) shows the delay-packet loss trade-off curve as a function of self-similarity (ff is a parameter determining the degree of self-similarity, being "highly" self-similar if ff is close to 1 and being weakly so if ff 2). For a fixed packet loss rate, we see a superlinear increase in delay as self-similarity is increased. Bandwidth, on the other hand, exhibits a much more robust performance gain, decreasing both packet loss rate and queueing delay as long as bottleneck links do not themselves form an extensive multi-stage network. Figure 1 (right) shows queueing delay as a function of self-similarity for several values of bottleneck bandwidth. It is interesting to note that under highly self-similar traffic conditions (ff = 1:05), the marginal benefit of increasing bandwidth is significantly greater vis-a-vis the case when traffic is less self-similar (ff = 1:95). The requirement on the bottleneck links not forming an extensive internetwork stems from the fact that for a given buffer size, the decrease in queueing delay may be accompanied by an increase in packet loss rate even if bandwidth is uniformly increased across all links. In the context of congestion control, the fundamental limit to traffic shaping imposed by the stringent QoS requirements of real-time traffic implies that a reservation- or priority-based packet scheduling scheme is needed to guarantee QoS with high probability. Since, other things being equal, this entails a severe reduction in network resource utilization due to the scale-invariant burstiness of self-similar traffic, the central problem reduces to one of utilizing left-over bandwidth effectively by provisioning best-effort service to non-stringent-QoS traffic. A distributed, adaptive scheme based on noncooperative computational markets and its efficacy at finding efficient allocations was shown in [7, 2]. This paper presents an application-sensitive congestion control protocol in the context of best-effort service provision that seeks to exploit the structure of long-range dependent traffic. First, for real-time applications engaging in interactive conversations consisting of the exchange of "short" packets, virtually no flow control is exerted beyond guaranteeing reliable transport, if needed, using positive acknowledgements. Such conversations (e.g., generated by Internet game servers and their client applications such as the Internet Go Server), even if numerous, do not significantly contribute to the aggregate traffic being self-similar, and
