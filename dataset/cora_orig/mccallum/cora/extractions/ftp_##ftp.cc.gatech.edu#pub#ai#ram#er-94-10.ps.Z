Abstract: Reading has been studied for decades by a variety of cognitive disciplines, yet no theories exist which sufficiently describe and explain how people accomplish the complete task of reading real-world texts. In particular, a type of knowledge intensive reading known as creative reading has been largely ignored by the past research. We argue that creative reading is an aspect of practically all reading experiences; as a result, any theory which overlooks this will be insufficient. We have built on results from psychology, artificial intelligence, and education in order to produce a functional theory of the complete reading process. The overall framework describes the set of tasks necessary for reading to be performed. Within this framework, we have developed a theory of creative reading. The theory is implemented in the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Creativity) system, a reading system which reads science fiction stories.

Reference-contexts: The model has been extremely successful in modeling psychological data regarding the reading process, particularly research dealing with recall of read material. Despite these accomplishments, the theory fails to consider two aspects of reading which are important <ref> (for a recent discussion of these issues, see Gerrig, 1993) </ref>. First, creative reading is not handled. Thus, while the theory may be valid for explaining structured reading tasks, it is unable to handle pleasure reading.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, it overlooked some crucial aspects of the reading process which we have identified, such as the story structure. This led to the system being overloaded by the sheer amount of knowledge contained in even a short story. Later systems tried to vary the reading depth, such as IPP <ref> (Lebowitz, 1983) </ref> and AQUA (Ram, 1991). Unfortunately, IPP failed to do any high-level reasoning, such as explanation of anomalies. AQUA added the explanation and reasoning supertask, as well as some of the memory supertask, but it ignored the story structure aspects which could have been a valuable aid.

Reference-contexts: Related work In addition to modeling the process of reading and creative understanding, our theory allows previous theories to be examined within a common framework. Past reading systems have not been greatly successful due to their insufficient coverage of the reading process. Early examples such as SAM and PAM <ref> (see chapters 5 and 7 in Schank & Riesbeck, 1981) </ref> were narrow attempts to handle what we call the scenario understanding supertask through scripts and plans. They did not try to benefit from the other supertasks we have identified; furthermore, they dealt with extremely short narratives.

Reference-contexts: Tasks include character identification, including protagonist and antagonist; setting identification (time and location); plot description, which builds a coherent summary of the story's plot; and genre identification, which identifies the text's style. This supertask is largely the result of the way in which reading is taught in Western culture <ref> (Smith, 1986) </ref>. * scenario understanding: The tasks making up the scenario understander are the event parser, which identifies agents, actions, states, objects, and locations within an episode; the agent modeler, which maintains descriptions of the agents, and tracks their goals, knowledge, and beliefs; the action modeler, which maintains descriptions of the
