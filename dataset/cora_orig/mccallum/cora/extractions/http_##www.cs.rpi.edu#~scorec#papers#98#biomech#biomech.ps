Reference-contexts: Mesh coarsening is needed in addition to refinement since high-gradient locations may move with time. Adaptive r-refinement can concentrate a mesh within high-error regions and follow these regions as they evolve. This mesh motion is often far less expensive than h-refinement <ref> (Adjerid & Flaherty, 1986) </ref> for a given accuracy. With parallel computation, r-refinement avoids the need for dynamic load balancing which must be done with h-refinement. Unfortunately, two-and three-dimensional meshes tend to tangle with r-refinement and there is no effective way of controlling the discretization error.

Reference-contexts: When applied to the Laplacian operator, the new basis reduces the growth of the condition number of the stiffness matrix from exponential to nearly linear in p (Aiffa, 1997; Adjerid et al., 1998a). Similar savings were recorded on problems with more complex stiffness matrices <ref> (Adjerid et al., 1998a) </ref> relative to other hierarchical bases (Carnevali et al., 1993). These hierarchical bases can be constructed to arbitrarily high orders; thus, facilitating adaptive p-refinement and a posteriori error estimation through adaptive p-refinement (x3.4). Mixed methods, where different components of u have different order approximations, are permitted.

Reference-contexts: The anisotropic biphasic theory (ABT) describes the mechanical interactions between cells and the ECM <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a) </ref>. It accounts for the biomechanical feedback loop in which cells deform the surrounding network of ECM fibers, which induces network alignment with inhomogeneous deformation and cell alignment (contact guidance). <p> In order to facilitate the rational interpretation of in vitro contraction experiments and the design of artificial tissues, Barocas and Tranquillo <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a) </ref> developed an ABT to describe the dynamic behavior of TEs that accounts for interaction between * cell growth and migration; 3 * the biphasic nature of the TE, containing a collagen phase and an interstitial water phase; * contractile stress exerted by the entrapped cells, driving the <p> The mathematical statement of the model <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a) </ref> is: 1 _ oe + 2 1 fi + 1 2 r [(oe + o c c ) P I] = 0; (2) Dt D + (r v) = 0; (4) r (1 ) rP + ' 0 r v = 0; (5) where _ oe j <p> Material properties associated with the collagen 4 network are the modulus G, the viscosity , Poisson's ratio , and the interstitial flow resistance ' 0 .

Reference-contexts: The adaptive finite element software has been applied to three axisymmetric ABT problems in order to demonstrate its advantages relative to more traditional solution techniques (x4). Problems involve a cylindrical isometric cell traction assay (x4.1, <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>), a model bioartificial artery (x4.2, (Tranquillo et al., 1996; L'Heureux et al., 1993)), and a model bioartificial artery with reinforced ends (x4.3). Each problem undergoes extensive material distortion which is accurately tracked by mesh relocation. <p> A variational form of (1)-(5) was developed and solved by a mixed finite element method with piecewise biquadratic velocities and concentrations, piecewise bilinear pressures, and discontinuous piecewise biquadratic stresses <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>. Although this formulation was successfully applied to several boundary value problems (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a), the associated software lacked the mesh generation and adaptivity capabilities necessary to handle sharp gradients and irregular configurations. <p> within the SCOREC mesh database (x3.1) facilitate the solution of (15) since all solution and shape function data are stored with the appropriate mesh entities. 4 Simulations We apply the adaptive finite element software to three initial-boundary value problems for the ABT system (1)-(5): an isometric cell traction assay (ICTA) <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>, a prototypical bioartificial artery (BAA) (L'Heureux et al., 1993; Tranquillo et al., 1996), and a BAA with thicker ends. Collagen parameter values (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a) and cell parameter values for the ICTA (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) and BAA (L'Heureux et al., 1993; Tranquillo et al., 1996) <p> value problems for the ABT system (1)-(5): an isometric cell traction assay (ICTA) <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>, a prototypical bioartificial artery (BAA) (L'Heureux et al., 1993; Tranquillo et al., 1996), and a BAA with thicker ends. Collagen parameter values (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997a) and cell parameter values for the ICTA (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) and BAA (L'Heureux et al., 1993; Tranquillo et al., 1996) problems were obtained from the literature. <p> As the cells contract, the force to maintain a constant length increases, and the circumfernce at the midplane (z = 0) decreases. The prior analysis of this problem <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>, without adaptivity, had difficulty resolving sharp gradients where the free and free-slip surfaces meet. We show that the adaptive hr-refinement procedure will alleviate this. Concentration and the axial stress contours are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively, at four times with the computational meshes superimposed. <p> There is a singularity, at the juncture of the no-slip and free-surface boundaries. This singularity strengthens as time increases. The mesh is concentrated in this region and graded to resolve the solution adequately. The axial stress obtained in a prior study <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref> had an anomalous oscillatory behavior that disappeared with (uniform) mesh refinement. Axial stress components obtained by adaptive hr-refinement (Figure 4) have no spurious behavior, presumably because the singularity is being adequately resolved on the graded mesh. <p> This is likely due to the self-similar behavior of the solution near the singularity. 4.4 Discussion An adaptive finite element software system has been used to solve the ABT system (1)-(5). Solutions of ICTA and BAA problems duplicate prior results <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref>; however, the adaptive solutions have comparable accuracy with fewer total DOF. With adaptive hr-refinement, we were able to locate singularities and automatically refine the mesh in their vicinity. No a priori solution knowledge was necessary. <p> Optimal enrichment strategies are needed to decide when and where to alter the mesh and vary the order. * In this study, linear algebra was performed by a sparse direct procedure. Preconditioned Krylov iteration has been effective on the ABT system <ref> (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b) </ref> and this should be tried within the adaptive system. * Backward difference software in a method-of-lines setting would typically return to a first-order method after each h- or p-refinement.

Reference-contexts: The first fraction in (7) accounts for the lag in cell traction stress due to the time needed to adjust to the change from suspension to tissue-equivalent. The cell traction force during this period has been correlated with cell spreading <ref> (Barocas et al., 1995) </ref>. The second fraction accounts for so-called contact inhibition, the reduction in cell traction observed at high cell densities (Moon & Tranquillo, 1995; Oster et al., 1983).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the choice q = p ensures that the solution accuracy is not diminished by the approximation of the boundary. The mesh is stored in a data structure called the SCOREC Mesh Database <ref> (Beall & Shephard, 1997) </ref> with data divided into entities that are element vertices, edges, and faces (finite elements in two dimensions). The representation is hierarchical with faces having pointers to their bounding edges which, in turn, have pointers to their bounding vertices.

Reference-contexts: (x4.1), the adaptive method produced a solution using only 16% of the degrees of freedom required by a uniform-mesh solution having comparable accuracy. 2 Anisotropic Biphasic Theory of Tissue-Equivalent Mechanics The entrapment of cells in a collagen gel to create an in vitro model TE was pioneered in the 1970s <ref> (Bell et al., 1979) </ref> and quickly emerged as an efficient and easily controllable method for studying cell behavior.

Reference-contexts: Separating the spatial and temporal discretization has the advantage that time integration procedures may be changed without affecting the larger finite element portion of the software. We use the variable-order, variable-time-step, backward-difference formula package DASPK (described in <ref> (Brenan et al., 1996) </ref>) to solve the ODE/DAE system. Nonlinear problems are solved by a damped Newton's method, and the linear system introduced at each Newton step is solved by sparse Gaussian elimination with a minimum degree reordering (Gursky & Sherman, 1977).

Reference-contexts: Mixed methods, where different components of u have different order approximations, are permitted. A traditional reason for using a mixed finite element method is the satisfaction of the Babuska-Brezzi stability condition <ref> (Brezzi & Fortin, 1991) </ref>. For an incompressible medium, this condition requires that the approximation space of the pressure be a subspace of that used for the velocity. This is often achieved by using a lower-order basis for the pressure than for the velocity. <p> This is often achieved by using a lower-order basis for the pressure than for the velocity. The pressure space may further be selected relative to a patch of elements (macro-elements) used for the velocity or made discontinuous relative to a continuous velocity space <ref> (Brezzi & Fortin, 1991) </ref>. Our software has no capabilities for macro-elements. While discontinuous spaces are possible, the computations of x4 used a piecewise quadratic polynomial for pressure and a piecewise cubic for all other variables in u.

Reference-contexts: The viscoelastic fluid momentum equation (5) cannot be eliminated by substitution into the stress balance equation (2); thus, unlike previous work involving elastic solid (Mow et al., 1980) or Newtonian fluid <ref> (Dembo & Harlow, 1986) </ref> models, the stress remains as a dependent variable. A variational form of (1)-(5) was developed and solved by a mixed finite element method with piecewise biquadratic velocities and concentrations, piecewise bilinear pressures, and discontinuous piecewise biquadratic stresses (Barocas & Tranquillo, 1997b).

With the concentration approximated by a piecewise cubic polynomial, the error indicator (11)-(12) might be proportional to the true error; however, with the complexities of the ABT system, this remains unverified.

Understanding TE mechanics is central to the design and fabrication of bioartificial tissues, including skin <ref> (Lopez Valle et al., 1992) </ref> and arteries (L'Heureux et al., 1993; Tranquillo et al., 1996). In this investigation, we solve the system of nonlinear partial differential equations governing the ABT theory (x2) by an adaptive finite element software system (x3, (Aiffa, 1997)).

Reference-contexts: an ABT to describe the dynamic behavior of TEs that accounts for interaction between * cell growth and migration; 3 * the biphasic nature of the TE, containing a collagen phase and an interstitial water phase; * contractile stress exerted by the entrapped cells, driving the compaction of the TE <ref> (Moon & Tranquillo, 1995) </ref>; * viscoelastic fluid behavior of the collagen matrix (Barocas et al., 1995; Knapp et al., 1997); * deformation-induced anisotropy in the collagen matrix; and * contact guidance (the preferential alignment of cells in the characteristic direction of matrix alignment, which in turn leads to anisotropic cell migration

Reference-contexts: The viscoelastic fluid momentum equation (5) cannot be eliminated by substitution into the stress balance equation (2); thus, unlike previous work involving elastic solid <ref> (Mow et al., 1980) </ref> or Newtonian fluid (Dembo & Harlow, 1986) models, the stress remains as a dependent variable.

Reference-contexts: The software has capabilities to * perform arbitrary combinations of adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (h-refinement), order variation (p-refinement), and mesh motion (r-refinement) (x3.5); * construct meshes of triangular elements on complex two-dimensional regions using an octree spatial decomposition <ref> (Shephard & Georges, 1991) </ref> (x3.1); * provide a high-order representation of (x3.1); * handle combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions for different solution components on stationary and moving boundaries; and * address mixed finite element formulations. Herein, only combinations of adaptive hand r-refinement have been used. <p> Aiffa (Aiffa, 1997) presents results using adaptive p- and hp-refinement. 3.1 Mesh Structures Prior to solution, the domain is discretized by an octree spatial decomposition <ref> (Shephard & Georges, 1991) </ref> and partitioned into triangular elements i , i = 1; 2; : : : ; N . Exact representation of curved regions is possible with elements having curved sides; thus, = [ N i=1 i .

Reference-contexts: Mesh data may be altered for use with h and r-refinement. The operators that create and delete elements eliminate most of the complex programming effort associated with adaptive h-refinement (x3.5). 3.2 Piecewise Polynomial Basis The finite element basis is a modification of the classical <ref> (Szabo & Babuska, 1991) </ref> hierarchical basis on a triangle. Thus, polynomial shape functions of degree p + 1 are obtained as corrections to shape functions of degree p. <p> Elements of the basis are associated with vertices (for p 1), edges (for p 2), and faces (for p 3); thus, complementing the structure of the SCOREC mesh database. The new basis (Aiffa, 1997; Adjerid et al., 1998a) differs from the classical <ref> (Szabo & 7 Babuska, 1991) </ref> one in that face functions (internal modes) satisfy an orthogonality condition in strain energy.

Reference-contexts: The technique performs best on diffusion-dominated problems. Procedures typically localize the error computation to an element or a patch of elements <ref> (Verfurth, 1996) </ref> to further reduce the cost of obtaining estimates. These local finite element problems are closed by prescribing fluxes on element or patch boundaries. Performance differs greatly with flux prescriptions (Ainsworth & Oden, 1993; Strouboulis & Haque, 1992).

Reference-contexts: In this case, the moving boundary is approximated by a piecewise polynomial of degree q. Interpolating a curved boundary to degree q introduces an O (h q+1=2 ) error in the H 1 -norm of the finite element solution <ref> (Wait & Mitchell, 1985) </ref>, where h is the length of the longest edge in the mesh and the H 1 -norm of a scalar function f on is kf k 1 j 1 : (10) Without such an approximation, the error of the finite element solution with a piecewise polynomial basis

Reference-contexts: This can be avoided by projecting the solution in the enriched space backwards in time to supply the necessary history to the backward difference software <ref> (Wang, 1991) </ref>. This strategy is being added to the software system. * For complex PDEs, a substantial effort is needed to calculate the elemental Galerkin inner products.
