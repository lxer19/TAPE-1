Abstract: We consider single-hop lightwave networks with stations interconnected using Wavelength Division Multiplexing. The stations are equipped with tunable transmitters and/or receivers. Coordination between the transmitting and receiving stations is achieved by assuming synchronous control and a predefined, time-frequency oriented schedule which specifies the slots and the wavelengths on which communication between any two pairs of stations is allowed to take place. We define and analyze, in terms of throughput, all possible types of schedules in the situation where the number of available wavelengths is equal to the number of stations. Our results are valid for the general case, i.e., non-uniform traffic. We then consider the optimization of schedules given the traffic requirements and present optimization heuristics that give near-optimal results.

Reference-contexts: WDM divides the low-loss wavelength spectrum of the optical fiber into a multitude of independent, non-overlapping channels, each operating at a data rate accessible by the transmitting stations. The multiple channels introduce transmission concurrency and provide a means to overcome the so called electronic bottleneck <ref> [1] </ref>. As a result, WDM networks have the potential of delivering to the end users an aggregate throughput that can grow with the number of wavelengths deployed, and can be in the order of Tbps. There are currently two approaches used to exploit the capabilities of WDM.

Reference-contexts: There are currently two approaches used to exploit the capabilities of WDM. Under the multihop approach, each network station is equipped with a small number of fixed transmitters and receivers <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. By assigning wavelengths to the transmitters and receivers a large variety of interconnection patterns can be realized, independent of the underlying physical topology of the network. Packets are relayed to their destination through, possibly, intermediate stations, undergoing conversion from the optical to the electrical domain in each hop.

Reference-contexts: Single hop systems require tunable lasers and/or filters with a large tuning range fi tuning speed product in order to fully utilize the capabilities of WDM. The state of the art in tunable laser and filter technology is discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. Although commercial products are not yet available, recent advances in lightwave technology are promising. The hardware requirements set aside, research in the area of single hop systems has focused on the problem of how to dynamically allocate the bandwidth among the network stations in an efficient way.

Reference-contexts: The hardware requirements set aside, research in the area of single hop systems has focused on the problem of how to dynamically allocate the bandwidth among the network stations in an efficient way. Numerous protocols have been devised (see <ref> [7] </ref> for an overview). In general, the protocols differ in whether they require coordination between the transmitter and receiver prior to the actual packet transmission, or not. Protocols based on pretransmission coordination [8, 9, 10, 11] employ a single, shared, control channel for the arbitration of the transmission requests. <p> Each station is equipped with one receiver and one transmitter. The properties of the network depend on whether the transmitters, the receivers, or both are tunable. Following the terminology in <ref> [7] </ref> we refer to the three resulting types of systems as TT-FR, FT-TR and TT-TR, respectively. If the receivers (transmitters) are fixed, wavelength i is assigned to the receiver (transmitter) of station i.

A schedule specifies the slots within each frame and the channel on which packet transmissions are permitted between any source-destination pair. <p> Although this is a hard problem, we are able to derive heuristics that give near-optimal results. Similar optimization problems, although in a different context, are addressed in [14, 15, 16]. In [17] a round-robin schedule is analyzed, under the assumption of uniform traffic. Also, in <ref> [13] </ref> the authors define four types of schedules (protocols in their terminology) and develop a closed queueing model to analyze their performance. That work, in contrast with ours, does not deal with schedule optimization, and the analysis is mostly restricted to uniform traffic. This paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we consider the problem of schedule optimization, given the traffic requirements. Although this is a hard problem, we are able to derive heuristics that give near-optimal results. Similar optimization problems, although in a different context, are addressed in <ref> [14, 15, 16] </ref>. In [17] a round-robin schedule is analyzed, under the assumption of uniform traffic. Also, in [13] the authors define four types of schedules (protocols in their terminology) and develop a closed queueing model to analyze their performance. <p> If a packet for station j arrives at station i while a packet for j is already stored in i's buffer, the new packet is lost. This is an extension of the model found in <ref> [14] </ref>. We assume single hop communication and do not allow a packet to be relayed to its destination through intermediate stations. <p> This was addressed in <ref> [14] </ref> for a single channel system. Expression (17) is valid for all three types of systems. However, in the following discussion we only consider TT-FR and FT-TR systems, in which transmissions to or from a certain station respectively, take place on the same channel. <p> The last two constraints guarantee that the resulting schedule is a one-to-one schedule. 5.1 Upper Bound As formulated, P 1 is a hard allocation problem. As a first step, we will try to get an upper bound. It can be shown <ref> [14] </ref> that T (1!1) i=1 j=1 M 1 (1 i p ij ) a ij (49) Let x ij = a ij =M . Variables x ij indicate the percentage of time that station i should transmit to station j. <p> We assume that each source has one buffer for storing packets with destination j. The probability of a packet arrival at each source i is just i p ij . This is exactly the single channel problem addressed in <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Our approach to obtain a near-optimal, one-to-one schedule is based on the golden ratio policy in <ref> [14] </ref>, where only frames of lengths equal to the Fibonacci numbers are considered. <p> Notice that in this case, slots are assigned although they will never be used. 4. If the a ij do not satisfy (39) consider the next Fibonacci number and repeat from Step 2. Otherwise, for all channels, use the golden ratio policy <ref> [14] </ref> to assign slots for transmissions within a channel, producing schedule S. S will be a one-to-many schedule for a TT-FR system or a many-to-one schedule for a FT-TR system. 5. <p> The smallest Fibonacci number is taken to be greater or equal to N 1 instead of N , since we assume that a station never has to transmit to itself. Finally, the golden ratio policy places transmissions within a channel in intervals close to the ones dictated by (49) <ref> [14] </ref>. 6 Obtaining Near-Optimal Schedules of Other Types In situations where Q ij = 1 (1 i p ij ) M t 1 for some pairs (i; j), one-to-one schedules may result in low throughput because of the requirement that at least one slot be assigned to any pair of stations,
