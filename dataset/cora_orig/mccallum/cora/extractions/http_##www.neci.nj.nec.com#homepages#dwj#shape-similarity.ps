Abstract: We study how to measure the degree of similarity between two image contours. We propose an approach for comparing contours that takes into account deformations in object shape, the articulation of parts, and variations in the shape and size of portions of objects. Our method uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost of bringing one shape into the other via local deformations. Using this as a starting point, we investigate the properties that such a cost function should have to model human performance and to perform usefully in a computer vision system. We suggest novel conditions on this cost function that help capture the part-based nature of objects without requiring any explicit decomposition of shapes into their parts. We then suggest several possible cost functions based on different physical models of contours, and describe experiments with these costs.

Reference-contexts: Deformable templates that reflect the specific shape of known objects have also been applied to contour extraction and modelling ([39, 31, 21]). Of particular relevance to our work: [32] suggest such an approach to judging the similarity of objects; <ref> [1] </ref> also propose such a method of comparing shape, with particular attention to producing fast algorithms that yield a metric; and [22, 4, 15] suggest learning a de-formable model from examples. Work based on measuring deformations has not considered the role of part structure and articulation in shape similarity. <p> This will be true of local cost measures, such as ours, that are invariant under rotation. It is not true of cost comparisons based on the difference in tangent between two contours, such as those of <ref> [1, 24, 32] </ref>. 2.3 Problems with one-to-one matching We have seen that problems arise in attempting to build a cost function that meets all the above conditions while making purely local comparisons. Such a cost must become linear for corners, which contradicts condition 7.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we develop a measure of similarity between line drawings of objects. This will be used to determine the class identity ("categorization") of objects and to cluster objects into classes. A good deal of work on categorization has emphasized the part structure of objects (eg. <ref> [5, 6, 23, 7, 2, 25, 9, 20] </ref>). We believe that part structure plays an important role in categorization, but we believe also that metric information has a significant influence on our perception of shapes. As an example, consider the two objects in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: See <ref> [3] </ref> for further discussion of this work. Our approach: We consider the applicability of continuous-deformation methods to the more general problem of human similarity judgements. Below we propose a set of properties that will be desirable in any approach to shape similarity. <p> We note that this form of F also follows from constraint (6) and from setting the triangle inequality to equality. This results in violating constraint (7) as shown in Section 2.4, but to the smallest possible degree. See <ref> [3] </ref> for details. <p> In <ref> [3] </ref> we demonstrate that this cost function meets the previously discussed constraints, except that it is not a metric. 3.3 Linear Cost Function Finally, we include a third possible cost function. As we have noted before, it is possible to satisfy both focusing instead on the similarities. of hypothesized occlusions. <p> Given two contours, we use dynamic programming to find the match that minimizes the cost function. Dynamic programming has been frequently applied to this problem, and its use is described in detail in <ref> [3] </ref>, or in [24], for example. To speed up the experiments we match the first points of each contour to each other. Alternately, for closed contours we could consider all possible initial matches. <p> Although the contours are equally distorted in the two figures, the internal 2-D regions are distorted in very different ways. This suggests that our general approach might be improved by considering a cost based on a mapping between 2-D regions bounded by the contours that we compare (however, see <ref> [3] </ref> for a counterexample). Second, Figure 10 shows another example that will be challenging to our approach, and perhaps to others.

Reference-contexts: There has been a great deal of work on this approach. For example, it has been applied to tracking non-rigid objects (eg., <ref> [14, 19, 8, 24] </ref>) where the amount of deformation between frames may be assumed to be relatively small. This approach has also been widely applied to handwriting recognition (eg., [30, 38, 33]) using measures of similarity that tend to be particularly crafted to that domain. <p> Most of the above systems, for example, compare shapes by measuring the difference in tangent direction between corresponding contour points. Articulation of an object at a part boundary will introduce great differences throughout the part with this type of representation. One exception to this is <ref> [8] </ref>, which uses a representation based on curvature in order to encourage matching curvature extrema between contours. While [8] suggest a cost function related to one we will suggest, they differ from us in their general motivation. <p> Articulation of an object at a part boundary will introduce great differences throughout the part with this type of representation.

While [8] suggest a cost function related to one we will suggest, they differ from us in their general motivation. They also differ from us in detail by not considering the consequences of applying such a cost measure to polygons. <p> More intuitively, we can think of this as judging cost based on the minimum amount of bend ing (change in curvature) and stretching ( dt ds , or t 0 ) required to make the curves identical (a similar view point is taken in <ref> [8] </ref>). We now propose properties that C should possess 2 . We will then consider the implica tions of these properties on the function F . 2.1 Constraints We propose the following constraints on C. 1. C is continuous. 2. C is a metric. 3.

Reference-contexts: We therefore allow for the possibility that portions of the two contours remain unmatched, under the assumption that the true corresponding portions of the contour are not visible. We now consider how a proposed cost function should deal with an hypothesized occlusion. (See <ref> [11] </ref> for another approach to this problem). The cost function for occlusions should reflect three factors. First, it is important to take account of the similarity between the relative positions of the beginning and ending of the hypothesized occlusion in each contour.

Reference-contexts: In either approach, smoothing will somewhat mitigate an undesirable effect that must occur without smoothing. See <ref> [36] </ref> for a related discussion on handling corners in functions describing the energy of a curve. 2.4 Incompatibility between Constraints We now demonstrate that it is impossible to simul taneously satisfy all desired constraints on the func tion F .

Reference-contexts: A third class of methods attempts to assign "semantic interpretation" to shapes, such as function, and make similarity judgements based on semantics (eg. <ref> [37, 16, 29, 28] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For example, it has been applied to tracking non-rigid objects (eg., [14, 19, 8, 24]) where the amount of deformation between frames may be assumed to be relatively small. This approach has also been widely applied to handwriting recognition (eg., <ref> [30, 38, 33] </ref>) using measures of similarity that tend to be particularly crafted to that domain. Deformable templates that reflect the specific shape of known objects have also been applied to contour extraction and modelling ([39, 31, 21]).

Reference-contexts: A third class of methods attempts to assign "semantic interpretation" to shapes, such as function, and make similarity judgements based on semantics (eg. [37, 16, 29, 28]). Also relevant to our work, [26] deform shapes by aligning the principal modes of their mass and stiffness matrices, <ref> [40] </ref> combine part and deformable template methods in a novel way quite different from ours, [18] compare shapes by minimizing the Hausdorff measure between them, and [35] proposes aligning shapes by applying piecewise affine transformations.
