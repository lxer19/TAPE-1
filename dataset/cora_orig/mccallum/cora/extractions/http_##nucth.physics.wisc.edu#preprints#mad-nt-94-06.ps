Reference-contexts: To fruitfully utilize correlation measurements as a clean signal of phase seperation, it is necessary to identify particles coming from the decays of resonances. A preliminary investigation of the effects of decays and final-state interactions on velocity correlations was given in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this talk we first discuss possible ways of distinguishing between particles coming from the decay of some resonance and those originating elsewhere and then elaborate on the universal features of multiplicity distributions.

Reference-contexts: The set of probabilities P N = 1 N =( N N ), where N is the cross-section for producing N particles of a given kind, provide information about the production mechanism. Simple models for boson production, such as emission from classical currents <ref> [2] </ref>, predict that the multiplicity distribution is Poisson, the generating function of which is given by F () = N=0 where hN i is the mean multiplicity. Experimental observation of Poisson distributions indicate that the emitted bosons are uncorrelated in momentum space.

Reference-contexts: Experimental observation of Poisson distributions indicate that the emitted bosons are uncorrelated in momentum space. In order to investigate deviations from the Poisson distribution, Kauffmann and Gyulassy introduced <ref> [3] </ref> combinants, C N . They are defined via the expansion log F () = log P 0 + k=1 For the Poisson distribution C 1 = hni, C 2 = C 3 = : : : = 0.

Reference-contexts: It follows from Eq.(2) that contributions to a given combinant from statistically independent distributions are additive. The utility of com-binants in the analysis of experimental data was investigated by several authors <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>. In a parallel development, observations of galaxy distributions have revealed the existence of dense regions where the matter density exceeds the average density of the universe by many orders of magnitude as well as regions devoid of matter [7]. <p> terms of combinants using Eq. (2) : P 0 = exp k # It follows that for combinants one can write an expression similar to that given in Eq. (9) : C N = N ! dn N W: (11) In medium-energy hadron collisions C k decreases as k increases <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Because of cancellations in Eqs. (3) through (5) one might expect this to be a rather general result and consequently the series in Eq. (8) to converge faster than the series in Eq. (8).

Reference-contexts: The total probability of emitting one boson is P S S X b i (15) and that of emitting two bosons is P S S X b i b j (16) and so on. One observes that P S N is the complete symmetric function <ref> [12] </ref> of degree N in the arguments b i . <p> This time P M N is the elementary symmetric function of degree N in the arguments z i . (In the complete symmetric functions the powers of the same argument are allowed, in the elementary symmetric functions they are not <ref> [12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In fact, fermion pairs produced in background fields follow a very similar multiplicity distribution <ref> [14] </ref>. In- troducing d i = 1 + z i one can rewrite Eq. (27) as 1 X P M ( M X log [1 + ( 1)d i ] : (28) Again as d i ! 0, the above distribution becomes Poisson.
