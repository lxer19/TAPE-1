Reference-contexts: For the above example of V = C, Other trading strategies based on this simple model are based on hedging with other similar constructs, e.g., using gamma (G), theta (Q), vega, rho (r) <ref> [1] </ref>, G = S 2 Q = t vega = P , P . (13) The BS equation, Eq. (1), may be written as Q + rSD + 2 2. <p> Equations The above two-variable set of stochastic differential equations for S and V of course can be processed by the BS methodology, subject to linear algebraic constraints, essentially combining weighted sums of these equations to subtract out the noise terms in dX and dY to contribute to a risk-neutral portfolio <ref> [1] </ref>. However, there exist other techniques to constrain such systems to paths that are not affected by noise to at least first and second order.

Reference-contexts: This can be developed by considering a slight generalization of the above BS equation for the variable ^ V , using methods given in a standard text <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Some Discretization Issues Since tree approximations and/or discretization of variables are often applied to calculating the above entities, it is useful to apply limits to some of these discretizations wherever possible [3-5]. Eq. (1) has another mathematically equivalent path-integral representation <ref> [6] </ref>, which often offers some advantages in formulation, calculation, and inclusion of boundary conditions. Here, attention is drawn to the derivation of limits on the meshes of d t and d V such that there can be maintained numerical equivalence between these equivalent algebraic representations. 3.1. <p> There are of course other discretizations than the Ito ^ prepoint discretization of stochastic differential equations such as Eq. (4), related to other differential-operator orderings of partial differential equations such as Eq. (1), also related to other transformations of variables in Lagrangians such as Eq. (23) <ref> [6] </ref>. This can be understood in the Stratonovich (midpoint discretized) representation for more than two variables for nonconstant diffusions, where it is seen that a Riemannian geometry is induced by the metric g GG , exhibiting the invariance of the basic probability distribution under this geometry [7].

Reference-contexts: In such highly nonlinear nonequilibrium contexts, it may be useful to look for other criteria that can maximize profits and reduce risk. A formal approach to a statistical mechanics of nonlinear financial markets (SMFM) <ref> [7] </ref> has been shown to be useful in other disciplines, e.g., analyses of electroencephalography and combat scenarios, as documented in several papers available from the http://www.ingber.com archive. <p> This can be understood in the Stratonovich (midpoint discretized) representation for more than two variables for nonconstant diffusions, where it is seen that a Riemannian geometry is induced by the metric g GG , exhibiting the invariance of the basic probability distribution under this geometry <ref> [7] </ref>. For example, the Lagrangian in in Eq. (23) is in the Ito ^ prepoint representation.

Reference-contexts: The development of powerful generic numerical techniques, e.g., adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) optimization <ref> [8] </ref> and path-integral (PATHINT) calculations have been demonstrated to be give numerical support to the sophisticated SMFM algebra, in general to the several disciplines just mentioned, and specifically to financial markets [9-12].

Reference-contexts: These physical entities provide another form of intuitive, but quantitatively precise, presentation of these analyses. For example, daily newspapers use this terminology to discuss the movement of security prices. The CMI can be used to develop trading rules <ref> [12] </ref>. The extreme sensitivity of the CMI gives rapid feedback on the changes in trends as well as the volatility of markets. A time-locked moving average, yielding averages over each time in moving windows during which the model is fit to data, provides manageable indicators for trading signals.

Canonical Momenta Indicators (CMI) The output of all this algebra need not be confined to complex algebraic forms or tables of numbers.
