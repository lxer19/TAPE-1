Reference-contexts: Sensor report location estimates z (k) were created by adding zero mean Gaussian noise to the true location. The covariance matrices of this sensor noise were generated according to a model of an airborne sensor platform. See <ref> [BPS92] </ref> for more details. At time k the current sensor error covariance matrix V (k) is reported without error, along with the location estimate z (k), to make up a sensor report.

Reference-contexts: A notable exception is [RB79], which we mention further in Section 6. One may also view the problem as a clustering problem with a prior density. Like target tracking, the clustering problem has received extensive research; see e.g. <ref> [Eve93] </ref> and the references therein. We work from a Bayesian framework to facilitate generalization to more complex Bayesian models, though similar or identical results can be obtained by a variety of methods. In Section 2 we describe our problem more formally.

Reference-contexts: The multitarget tracking problem has been extensively researched and has a wide variety of applications from air traffic control to robotics and image processing. We refer the reader to <ref> [BSF88, BB90, MCTW86] </ref> and the references contained therein. We use the term static to refer to the fact that the target states are constant. This is nonetheless an important special case which, for example, can often adequately model seldom-moving or slow-moving targets. <p> in Section 6, in conjunction with the algorithm described in the following section. 4 A Simple Association-Estimation Algorithm Us ing Priors In this section we present a simple data association and estimation algorithm which can be derived using the assumptions of Section 2 and the general hypothesis evaluation formulation of <ref> [MCTW86] </ref>. We first present the algorithm, followed by some notes on the algorithm. The algorithm is a "greedy" (or "nearest neighbor" [BB90] or "zero scan" [Rei79]) algorithm. <p> both UT and TT significantly outperform UU, but the differences between TT and UT are too small to be significant. 7 Extensions There are a variety of possible extensions to the basic model and algorithms we have presented, most of which are still covered by the very general framework of <ref> [MCTW86] </ref>. Some of these extensions include higher dimensional state vectors, non-static cases with motion models, non-Gaussian sensor reports, more general sensor models, more sophisticated data association and hypothesis management techniques, time dependent priors, and non-independent targets.

Reference-contexts: The association is made which is locally optimal. Sensor reports are never again considered by the algorithm, thus a hard, irretrievable decision is made, unlike in batch algorithms <ref> [Mor77] </ref> and multiple hypothesis algorithms [Rei79]. The algorithm proceeds as if all previously made decisions were correct. The algorithm is as follows.

Reference-contexts: We use known terrain features of the region to construct the prior density for target locations. While the volume of research on target tracking is large, few authors have focused on using terrain information to construct a prior density. A notable exception is <ref> [RB79] </ref>, which we mention further in Section 6. One may also view the problem as a clustering problem with a prior density. Like target tracking, the clustering problem has received extensive research; see e.g. [Eve93] and the references therein. <p> Representing these densities and computing integrals over them can be computationally expensive, both in association and estimation and in time-updating the densities. In <ref> [RB79] </ref> a terrain-based motion model is defined, along with the appropriate association and estimation equations. The approach taken is to discretize all variables: space, time, velocity, and a discrete moving/not moving variable.

Reference-contexts: Equation (2) is the static target assumption, and equation (3) describes the sensor model. These types of sensor reports are sometimes called "occasional measurements", as opposed to radar-scan type measurements <ref> [Rei79] </ref>. In our model each measurement corresponds to an actual target so there are no "false alarms" or "clutter" measurements. 3 Or track in the non-static case. 4 Note that the "=" sign in p ( ~ Y = ~ XjZ) is set equality. <p> We first present the algorithm, followed by some notes on the algorithm. The algorithm is a "greedy" (or "nearest neighbor" [BB90] or "zero scan" <ref> [Rei79] </ref>) algorithm. <p> The association is made which is locally optimal. Sensor reports are never again considered by the algorithm, thus a hard, irretrievable decision is made, unlike in batch algorithms [Mor77] and multiple hypothesis algorithms <ref> [Rei79] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In a situation where the true target locations are known but perfect association information is not available, or where the sensor error densities are only approximations, it may be preferable to use a similar score measure but using the true locations instead of P erf ectM ixture. See <ref> [SPB89] </ref> for an axiomatic approach to performance measures of a similar type. In theory, we could simply compute the true probability of each data association hypothesis given Z or compute the true posterior density value for any estimate given Z.
