Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a VLSI routing controller for use in the Hexagonal Architecture for Real-Time Systems (HARTS) that is currently being built at the Real-Time Computing Laboratory at The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The routing controller is a microprogrammed unit designed to function as an intelligent front-end interface for the interconnection network. Unlike other routing controllers known to date, this routing controller allows for the flexibility to investigate several low-level routing algorithms by downloading the appropriate microcode into the routing controller.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION This paper presents the VLSI design and implementation of a routing controller for a distributed computing system based on a hexagonal mesh architecture <ref> [1, 4, 5] </ref>. This effort is part of a larger research project to design and implement an experimental distributed real-time system called Hexagonal Architecture for Real-Time Systems (HARTS). <p> A C-type wrapping has several nice properties as shown in <ref> [1] </ref>. First, this wrapping results in a homogeneous network. Consequently, any node can view itself as the center (labeled as node 0) of the mesh. Second, the diameter of a H-mesh of dimension e is e 1. <p> This routing scheme and its associated algorithm are currently the primary routing algorithm being used in HARTS. For example, the (m 0 ; m 1 ; m 2 ) triple calculated using the algorithm in <ref> [1] </ref> for routing a message from node 1 to node 10 is (1; 1; 0) (See Figure 1).

In <ref> [5] </ref>, Stevens proposed a VLSI architecture for the inter-node communication in the FAIM-1 sys 1 Appeared in Int'l Conf. on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers (1989) tem that is based on a hexagonal mesh interconnection topology. But to the best of our knowledge, this architecture is yet to be implemented. <p> Figure 1 illustrates an example of a C-wrapped H-mesh of dimension 3 in which the gray links on the periphery are connected to the nodes as indicated by the label of the link. The C-wrapped H-mesh described above is isomorphic to the interconnection topology presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the above formalism allows routing of messages between all pairs of nodes to be treated uniformly and does not require any special treatment of the "wrap lines" as was necessary in [5] when the "axial offset" was between e and 2 (e 1). <p> The C-wrapped H-mesh described above is isomorphic to the interconnection topology presented in <ref> [5] </ref>.
