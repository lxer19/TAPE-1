Reference-contexts: The representation of transit users choice behavior, with respect to the different transit services available in the transit network considered, is obtained by using a state-of-the-art transit assignment model, such as the onesdescribed by Spiess and Florian [19] or De Cea and Fernandez <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach departs from that taken by other authors who have proposed models which do not integrate those abovementioned methodological developments and consequently have made restrictive assumptions with respect to both the transit network representation and the transit users behavior. <p> In a static, steady-state model (such as ours), we have to assume that no overloading takes place. It is true that some approaches have been made to alleviate the problem of overestimation of boardings resulting from limited bus capacities (see De Cea and Fernandez <ref> [4] </ref> for instance), but these can only be partial remedies. We believe that, as is the case for the traffic assignment problem, static models can still provide valuable information. 16 3. Solution approaches. 3.1. Finding the users-operators equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, in this case, the equilibrium conditions (7) must hold with u equal to zero. It is easy to show (Fernandez and Bravo <ref> [7] </ref>) that conditions (8) can be expressed as the variational inequality: (B fl ; F fl )(B fl B) 0; 8B 2 ; (9) where represent the row vector f l g l2L , B the column vector fb l g l2L and the feasible region defined by the linear constraints:

Reference-contexts: The model presented in this paper constitutes a natural extension of the developments obtained in the field of network equilibrium and transit systems modelling. Actually, the transport users behavior is described through the use of a bimodal equilibrium based on the formulation proposed earlier by Florian and Spiess <ref> [9] </ref>. The representation of transit users choice behavior, with respect to the different transit services available in the transit network considered, is obtained by using a state-of-the-art transit assignment model, such as the onesdescribed by Spiess and Florian [19] or De Cea and Fernandez [4]. <p> The models previously quoted differ only in the number 9 of attractive lines that can be dealt with. A bimodal mode choice/assignment equilibrium model such as that of Florian and Spiess <ref> [9] </ref> can be used to predict both transit passengers and private car flows, given a road network G (N ; A), a transit network G (N ; L), the transit fleet size for each transit line l 2 L, a logit mode-split model and origin-destination matrix. <p> The next iterate is defined as a solution to the pair of variational inequalities: (B k+1 ; F k )(B k+1 B) 0 8B 2 17 Given that efficient algorithms exist for the resolution of the passengers as-signment problem (see Florian and Spiess <ref> [9] </ref>) we will focus on solution approaches to the operators equilibrium problem. Since a block Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithm will be used to solve the system of variational inequalities (16), some information has to be transferred between the subsystems, at each iteration. <p> If modal split is to be included then a calibrated modal split model of the logit form is also required (see Florian and Spiess <ref> [9] </ref>). In this latter case, only a joint private-public O/D matrix is required.

Reference-contexts: An equilibrium will be reached when each player is at a maximum, given the current decisions of all other players. An equilibrium solution can be computed by simultaneously solving all operators optimization problems for a Nash equilibrium (see Friedman <ref> [10] </ref>: max l (F; B) 8l 2 L s.t. F : is a bimodal equilibrium b l 0 8l 2 L: For the solution of this problem the Jacobi iterative scheme seems appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Kocur and Hendrickson [12] propose a model of a simplified, continuous representation of the transit system, where transit service characteristics are considered homogeneous, invariant over space and independent of flow. Kanemoto [13] considers competitive railway firms competing on a radial, symmetric network. More recently, Harker <ref> [11] </ref> has proposed an interesting model which extends Viton's work by introducing an explicit representation of the transit network services.

Reference-contexts: Although this is considered to be a difficult problem in its general form, efficient heuristic have been devised to solve particular instances, such as the equilibrium network design (see Marcotte <ref> [14] </ref>). An alternative formulation is obtained if we assume that each line l 2 L is operated by a single transit firm. Then, in the operators subsystem, there will be as many players as lines operated.

Reference-contexts: The continuity issue is more sensitive. Indeed the cost function is not continuous for ' l = 0. However it is possible (see Marcotte and Blain <ref> [15] </ref>) to make the function l (B; F ) continuous at the origin by showing that the ratios ~ f l =b l can be bounded by constants K l dependent solely on the problem parameters. Uniqueness of the equilibrium solution, even under "reasonable" assumptions, could not be proved. <p> Uniqueness of the equilibrium solution, even under "reasonable" assumptions, could not be proved. The equilibrium set, as examplified in the Appendix (see also Marcotte and Blain <ref> [15] </ref>), can be stable, unstable or even disconnected. Part of the problem is due to the inability of the model to distinguish between perfectly matched lines composed of identical sequences of arcs, stops, transfer nodes.
