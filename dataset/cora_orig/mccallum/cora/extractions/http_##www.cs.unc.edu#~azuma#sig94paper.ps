Abstract: In Augmented Reality, see-through HMDs superimpose virtual 3D objects on the real world. This technology has the potential to enhance a user s perception and interaction with the real world. However, many Augmented Reality applications will not be accepted until we can accurately register virtual objects with their real counterparts. In previous systems, such registration was achieved only from a limited range of viewpoints, when the user kept his head still. This paper of fers improved registration in two areas. First, our system demonstrates accurate static registration across a wide variety of viewing angles and positions. An optoelectronic tracker provides the required range and accuracy . Three calibration steps determine the viewing parameters. Second, dynamic errors that occur when the user moves his head are reduced by predicting future head locations. Inertial sensors mounted on the HMD aid head-motion prediction. Accurate determination of prediction distances requires low-overhead operating systems and eliminating unpredictable sources of latency. On average, prediction with inertial sensors produces errors 2-3 times lower than prediction without inertial sensors and 5-10 times lower than using no prediction at all. Future steps that may further improve registration are outlined.

Reference-contexts: While these steps reduce flexibility and make it harder to debug the system, they are needed to insure accurate prediction. Appendix E on the CDROM demonstrates the accuracy of our prediction distance estimation. 6 Additional lessons Augmented Reality demands higher accuracy from head trackers than Virtual Environment applications do <ref> [3] </ref>. The main difficulty in duplicating our demonstration of static registration is in acquir - ing a head tracker that one can trust at long ranges. Wooden crates are easy to build, and the calibration techniques are straightforward and applicable to any tracking system or see-through HMD.

Reference-contexts: Medical applications might also benefit from Augmented Reality. A group at UNC scanned a fetus inside a womb with an ultrasonic sensor, then displayed a three-dimensional representation of that data in the same physical location as the fetus <ref> [4] </ref>. The goal is to provide a doctor with Xray vision, enabling him to gaze directly into the body. Conceptually, anything not detectable by human senses but detectable by machines might be transducted into something that we can sense and displayed inside a see-through HMD.

Reference-contexts: He directly measures parameters with instruments and runs a camera calibration optimizer that requires the user to identify the location of ~20 object points from several dif ferent viewpoints. The best accuracy he achieves is -12mm. In contrast, step 3 of our procedure is similar to Caudells <ref> [6] </ref> registration platform, which computes the Eye-&gt;T racker position and orientation offset by having the user line up two circles and two lines. He does not provide any information on how accurate his static registration is, and his registration procedure lacks equivalents to our steps 2 and 4.

Reference-contexts: Since the normal Pxpl5 software is optimized for maximum throughput and not minimal latency, we use dif ferent rendering software written by Mark Olano and Jon Cohen that minimizes Pxpl5 latency <ref> [8] </ref>. Special care was taken to use fast communication paths and low-overhead operating systems. Interprocessor communication is through shared memory, across Bit3 bus extenders, or through the 640 MByte/sec ring network within Pixel-Planes 5. UNIX is avoided except for initial setup and non-time-critical tasks, like reading buttons.

Reference-contexts: Deering [10] demonstrated an impressive registration of a real and virtual ruler in a head-tracked stereo system. Registration is a somewhat easier task in head-tracked stereo vs. an HMD-based system because the images do not change nearly as much for the same amount of head translation or rotation <ref> [9] </ref>. An extensive literature of camera calibration techniques exists in the robotics and photogrammetry communities (see the references in [21] as a start).
