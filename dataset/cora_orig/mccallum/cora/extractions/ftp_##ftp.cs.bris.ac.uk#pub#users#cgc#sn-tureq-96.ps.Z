Reference-contexts: The significance of this result is, however, more than simply theoretical. Indeed, it provides a foundation for the comparison of state nets with other computationally equivalent behavioural models on the basis of their relative modelling (or expressive) power. The notion of modelling power was developed in <ref> (Peterson, 1981) </ref>. It takes into account not only what a given model can do, but also how efficiently (or succinctly) it does it. The strict adherence of state nets to the objectoriented philosophy, combined with a relatively simple syntax, greatly enhance their expressive power.
