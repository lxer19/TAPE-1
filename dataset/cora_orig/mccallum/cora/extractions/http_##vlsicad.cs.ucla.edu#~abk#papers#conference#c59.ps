Abstract: This paper gives new methods for calculating the time-domain response for a finite-length distributed RC line that is stimulated by a ramp input. The following are our contributions. First, we obtain the solution of the diffusion equation for a semi-infinite distributed RC line with ramp input. We then present a general and, in the limit, exact approach to compute the time-domain response for finite-length RC lines under ramp input by summing distinct diffusions starting at either end of the line. Next, we obtain analytical expressions for the finite time-domain voltage response for an open-ended finite RC line and for a finite RC line with capacitive load. The delay estimates using this method are very close to SPICE-computed delays. Finally, we present a general recursive equation for computing the higher-order diffusion components due to reflections at the source and load ends. Future work extends our method to response computations in general interconnection trees by modeling both reflection and transmission coefficients at discontinu-ities.

Reference-contexts: Because of the highly resistive nature of the wires, present-day tools model the wires inside integrated circuits as distributed RC lines. The analysis of finite RC transmission lines with step input is widely discussed in the literature, e.g., <ref> [22, 25, 1, 24] </ref>. The standard approach is to first calculate the transfer function; then, by approximating the transfer function both transform-domain and time-domain responses are obtained for different configurations of the finite RC line with step input.

Reference-contexts: It is more reasonable to model the input signal from drivers to interconnect lines as a finite ramp input. However, analysis of finite RC transmission lines under ramp input has received comparatively little attention. Kaupp <ref> [11] </ref> analyzed RC interconnections under finite ramp input by assuming infinitely long transmission lines. Extending this work, [3] approximated the transfer function of a semi-infinite line using a linear function, and proposed a model for RC lines under ramp input. <p> Our contributions are the following. * We first obtain the time-domain response of a semi-infinite RC line for both infinite and finite ramp inputs by solving the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions. This result matches the semi-infinite ramp response given in <ref> [11] </ref>. * We then provide a general approach to compute the time-domain response for finite RC lines by summing distinct diffusions starting at either end of the line; each of these can be viewed as traveling either forward or backward along the line, in analogy with reflections.
