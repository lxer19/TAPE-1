Abstract: Work in syntactic theory has almost universally assumed that phrase structure is characterized in terms of the abstract structural relations of dominance and precedence. In this paper, we suggest instead that hierarchical structure is determined by a primitive relation of c-command. This proposal has the consequence that the range of possible phrase structures is substantially restricted in a linguistically natural way, obviating the need for certain previously stipulated restrictions. Furthermore, by understanding structure in terms of primitive c-command, we arrive at a natural understanding of the structural and derivational differences between substitution and adjunction, without resort to the machinery of segments and categories. dominance and precedence. Yet, so far as we are aware, there have been fl Thanks to the following for stimulating discussion: Paolo Acquaviva, John Chen, Paul Hagstrom, Richard Kayne, Tony Kroch, Fero Kuminiak, Peter Ludlow, Paul Portner, Jim Rogers, Paul Smolensky, Juan Uriagereka, and Scott Weinstein.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of arguments for this relaxation, the most straightforward stemming from head movement. 37 If movement must be to some c-commanding head, as in the structure in (62), it necessarily will not target the root of the structure <ref> (but see Bobaljik and Brown, 1997) </ref>. Why should adjunction and substitution differ in this fashion? Under the characterization of these operations as combinations of set-theoretic terms, there is no easily available reason (but see Kitahara, 1995 for an explanation in terms of economy conditions).

Reference-contexts: In the case of substitution, we need only say that the inserted node must be the projection of one of the roots of the combined cc-kluwer.tex; 2/10/1998; 13:18; p.43 44 robert frank and k. vijay-shanker structures <ref> (perhaps for reasons similar to those adduced by Chomsky, 1995, ch.4) </ref>. The substitution operation itself, as defined in (56)a, is symmetrical with respect to the two objects that are combined, and thus either one may in principle project.

Reference-contexts: The first is the node that is not c-commanded, i.e., A. This node, which was picked out by our previous notion of root, does have one property that we ascribe to roots, namely cc-kluwer.tex; 2/10/1998; 13:18; p.44 primitive c-command 45 it is not embedded <ref> (in the sense of Epstein, 1995) </ref>. Further, this node serves as the only possible locus for further adjunction (Kayne, 1994). The other distinguished minimum is the node which c-commands nothing, i.e., D.

Reference-contexts: Next, let us take the question of projection. Perhaps the most significant difference between adjunction and substitution lies in the fact that the latter, but not the former, requires that a new instance of a node (category) be projected upon combination <ref> (but see Epstein, 1998 for a different view) </ref>. Given the view of adjunction and substitution we have sketched, this difference follows directly from the rootedness condition in (13) above. Consider the case of substitution.

Reference-contexts: Since a node's precedence relations are determined independently of the nodes that dominate it (necessarily with the exclusivity condition, since they stand in a dominance relation), we have no way of guaranteeing that the subconstituents of x all precede the subconstituents of y when x itself precedes y <ref> (but see McCawley, 1982) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the definition of c-command used by Barker and Pullum (1990), for instance, in which any pair of nodes in the domination relation are related by c-command as well, every pair of nodes is distinguished by c-command. In the definition of c-command involving branching nodes <ref> (Reinhart 1976) </ref>, again we have the situation that D and E are indistinguishable in terms of c-command. Under this definition, then, we can also arrive at the conclusion then that domination is not definable from c-command. <p> Since domination already satisfies extensionality, the extensionality condition on this version of c-command has no additional force and does not serve to limit the class of structures. Finally, suppose we understand c-command as defined in terms of branching nodes <ref> (Reinhart 1976) </ref>: (35) x c-commands y iff every branching node dominating x also dominates y and neither dominates the other. Under this definition, nodes on a node chain are not only c-commanded by the same set of nodes, but now also c-command the same nodes.
