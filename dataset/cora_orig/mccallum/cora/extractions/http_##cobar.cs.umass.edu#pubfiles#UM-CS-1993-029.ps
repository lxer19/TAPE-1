Abstract: Computer Science Technical Report 93-29 April 1993 Abstract The Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals (IPUS) architecture is presented as a framework that exploits formal signal processing models to structure the bi-directional interaction between front-end signal processing and signal understanding processes. This architecture is appropriate for complex environments, which are characterized by variable signal to noise ratios, unpredictable source behaviors, and co-occuring objects whose signal signatures can distort each other. A key aspect of this architecture is that front-end signal processing is dynamically modifiable in response to scenario changes and to the need to re-analyze ambiguous or distorted data. This architecture tightly integrates the search for the appropriate front-end signal processing configuration with the search for plausible interpretations. In our opinion, this dual search, informed by formal signal processing theory, is a necessary component of perceptual systems for intelligent agents that must interact with complex environments. In order to explain this architecture in detail, an example of its use in an implemented system for acoustic signal interpretation is presented.

Reference-contexts: This requirement is feasible only for significantly constrained environments.

As an example of variable processing goals, consider a system with the primary goal of responding to either the sounds of an infant or a ringing telephone while ignoring other sounds.

This approximation retains the major features in the regular STFT output but its computation requires essentially no multiplications (a major part of regular STFT computation) and significantly fewer additions than the regular STFT.

An SPA's parameter values induce capabilities or limitations with respect to the scenario being monitored. Consider the generic Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm <ref> [27] </ref> in the acoustic domain. An STFT instance has particular values for its parameters, such as analysis window length, frequency-sampling rate, and decimation interval (separation between consecutive analysis window positions).

Reference-contexts: This diagnosis process relies on an environment's context rules and the domain's SPA processing models to define distortion processes that take place when an SPA's assumptions about its input signals are violated <ref> [28] </ref>. Note that there is a difference between discrepancies and signal distortion processes. Distortion processes are used to explain discrepancies. It is also possible for several distortion processes to explain the same kinds of discrepancies. <p> This research represents the formalization and extension of concepts explored in earlier work on a diagnosis system that exploited formal signal processing theory to debug signal processing systems <ref> [28] </ref> and in work on meta-level control [19, 20] that used a process of fault-detection, diagnosis, and replanning to decide the most appropriate parameters for controlling a problem-solving system. <p> When applied to an abstract description of anticipated or computed correlates, an operator returns the description modified to contain the operator's distortion. The KS uses these operators in a means-ends analysis framework incorporating multiple abstraction levels and a verification phase <ref> [28] </ref> to "explain" fault, violation, and conflict discrepancies. The KS takes two inputs: an initial state representing anticipated correlates and a goal state representing the computed correlates. <p> If no patch is possible, and no alternative explana 26 tions can be generated, the involved signal hypotheses are annotated with an SOU with a very negative rating. Figure 7 outlines the plan-and-verify strategy of the diagnostic process. source. An issue not addressed in earlier work <ref> [28] </ref> that arose in the development of IPUS is the problem of inapplicable explanations. Sometimes the first explanation offered by the KS will not enable the reprocessing mechanism to eliminate a discrepancy.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the KS mimics expert diagnostic reasoning in that it offers simplest (shortest) explanations first <ref> [32] </ref>. Once a sequence is found, the KS enters its verify phase, "drops" to the lowest abstraction level, and checks that each operator's pre- and post-conditions are met when all available state information is considered.

Reference-contexts: design along five dimensions based on where they emphasize the placement and organization of this knowledge: 1. within high-level interpretation knowledge sources (HLKSs) (e.g., as improved or approximate models of environmental phenomena [14, 15, 24, 35]), 2. within numeric-level KSs (SPAs) (e.g., as control parameter optimization processes or feedback loops <ref> [6, 17, 33] </ref>), 3. in the control of HLKSs' application (e.g., in planning architectures for controlling KS activation and sophisticated evidential representations [4, 7, 8, 15, 30]), 4. in the control of SPAs' application (e.g., as differential diagnosis rules for SPA application to disambiguate objects in the environment [11, 12, 22]), <p> Given the adaptive nature of the IPUS architecture, it is important to distinguish between the IPUS approach and the classic adaptive control theory approach <ref> [33] </ref>. Control theory uses stochastic-process concepts to characterize signals, and these characterizations are limited to probabilistic moments, usually no higher 22 than second-order. Discrepancies between these stochastic characterizations and an SPA's output data are used to adapt future signal processing.

Reference-contexts: The cut mechanism also does not permit the use of formal diagnostic reasoning to further constrain parameter-value search based on the cause of an SPA predicate failure. Research in active vision and robotics has recognized the importance of tracking-oriented front-end SPA reconfiguration <ref> [34] </ref>, and tends to use a control-theoretic approach for making reconfiguration decisions. It is indeed sometimes possible to reduce the reconfiguration of small sets of front-end SPAs to problems in linear control theory.

Reference-contexts: One can categorize research efforts in architectural design along five dimensions based on where they emphasize the placement and organization of this knowledge: 1. within high-level interpretation knowledge sources (HLKSs) (e.g., as improved or approximate models of environmental phenomena <ref> [14, 15, 24, 35] </ref>), 2. within numeric-level KSs (SPAs) (e.g., as control parameter optimization processes or feedback loops [6, 17, 33]), 3. in the control of HLKSs' application (e.g., in planning architectures for controlling KS activation and sophisticated evidential representations [4, 7, 8, 15, 30]), 4. in the control of SPAs'
