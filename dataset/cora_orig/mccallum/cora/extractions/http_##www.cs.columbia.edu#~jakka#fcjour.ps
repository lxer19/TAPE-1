U (p ) is compact, and F is continuous on U (p ), so there exists an x ) mini mizing F <ref> [1] </ref>. b. So M (p ) is defined for all p c. Furthermore, convexity of U (p ) and strong convexity of F on U (p ) imply that x unique for any p d. So, M is not multivalued and is a function. Existence of Equilibrium 20 2. <p> We implemented the flow control economy and simulated its behavior on randomly generated networks. In each simulation, the network had 50 virtual circuits and 25 data links. The capacity of link i, C i , was a random variable with uniform distribution on the interval <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. S i was 0.8 C i for all links. control economy for various network definition parameters. The X-axis represents the number of iterations of the economy (the number of price updates in step 4 of algorithm 2).

Reference-contexts: This means VC a should get at least as much of its bottleneck link as any other VC. This condition maximizes the minimum throughput and is referred to as Bottleneck or Max-Min flow control <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. F2 is based on the assumption that all VCs want to maximize throughput and does not consider delay objectives. <p> Jaffes algorithm computes a solution that is more fair than he claims. The solution is in fact fair by F4. Other definitions of fairness equivalent to F2 include special rules to ensure that the solution is also Pareto-optimal <ref> [3] </ref>. The main advantage of the flow control economy over this previous work is that diverse preferences are allowed. The previous work assumes that all VCs are throughput oriented. <p> The economy never reaches an equilibrium. Convergence to Equilibrium 31 6.0 Comparison with Related Work The flow control problem for virtual circuit networks has been extensively studied. Comprehensive surveys of this work can be found in <ref> [3, 8, 28] </ref>. In this section, we compare previous work to the flow control economy. Flow control has two goals. The first is obtaining an optimal tradeoff between throughput and delay [3]. The second is fairly allocating the communication resources to the set of VCs. <p> Comprehensive surveys of this work can be found in [3, 8, 28]. In this section, we compare previous work to the flow control economy. Flow control has two goals. The first is obtaining an optimal tradeoff between throughput and delay <ref> [3] </ref>. The second is fairly allocating the communication resources to the set of VCs. The economy is compared to previous work with respect to meeting these goals. Window flow control is the most common flow control algorithm used in practice [3, 28]. <p> The second is fairly allocating the communication resources to the set of VCs. The economy is compared to previous work with respect to meeting these goals. Window flow control is the most common flow control algorithm used in practice <ref> [3, 28] </ref>. Each VC has a source A that sends data units and a destination B that accepts the data units and sends acknowledgements back to A. Flow control is implemented by assigning a window size W to A. <p> The main advantage of window flow control relative to the flow control economy is that window flow control is dynamic. At most W data units can be transmitted before throughput is decreased to compensate for a transient period of congestion <ref> [3] </ref>. The flow control economy computes static transmission rates and does not react to transient conditions. A second advantage is that the window sizes can be chosen to guarantee that buffer overflows do not occur at any routing nodes. One problem with window flow control is choosing the window sizes. <p> For example, the set of VCs experiencing delays due to congestion may be throughput oriented, and should not have their window sizes decreased. The flow control economy does not have this problem. Comparison with Related Work 32 Window flow control can be unfair to short VCs <ref> [3] </ref>. The window size of a VC must be an in-creasing function of the number of links in its path to meet its throughput goals during periods with light contention. <p> During periods of heavy congestion, this makes it likely that a long VC gets more capacity of a heavily loaded link than a shorter VC sharing the same link <ref> [3] </ref>. The fairness of the flow control economy with respect to long VCs versus short VCs was described in section 3. The flow control problem can be combined with circuit routing to form a single optimization problem [3]. <p> of a heavily loaded link than a shorter VC sharing the same link <ref> [3] </ref>. The fairness of the flow control economy with respect to long VCs versus short VCs was described in section 3. The flow control problem can be combined with circuit routing to form a single optimization problem [3]. The problem is to choose a path P a and a transmission rate (throughput) r a for each VC a that minimizes: D a + e a (r a ). <p> This is a major shortcoming of the economy. Quantifying the performance degradation due to not dynamically assigning routes is an area for future work. A third class of flow control algorithms are Bottleneck or max-min algorithms <ref> [3] </ref>. These algorithms are based input rate adjustment. The algorithms primary goals is to compute allocations which are fair by condition F2. An efficient decentralized algorithm for computing rate assignments that are fair by condition F2 has been proposed by Jaffe [12]. Other algorithms are presented in [3]. <p> or max-min algorithms <ref> [3] </ref>. These algorithms are based input rate adjustment. The algorithms primary goals is to compute allocations which are fair by condition F2. An efficient decentralized algorithm for computing rate assignments that are fair by condition F2 has been proposed by Jaffe [12]. Other algorithms are presented in [3]. The main disadvantage of bottleneck flow control is the assumption that all VCs are throughput oriented. This approach is less general than the flow control economy. We compared the fairness properties of the economy with bottleneck flow control in section 1.

Reference-contexts: Optimality and Fairness 11 This condition is not always satisfied by flow control algorithms that attempt to optimize a global performance metric. For example, in <ref> [4] </ref> it is shown that maximizing certain global metrics based on power may yield solutions that are not fair by F1. Condition F1 states that no VC should be involuntarily assigned 0 throughput. A VC may decide to terminate if the throughput it is assigned does not meet its requirements. <p> Sanders algorithm is decentralized and asynchronous, and maximizes the sum of the individual utilities. The algorithm can assign transmission rate 0 to a circuit and is unfair by condition F1. The algorithm also requires some coordination between choice of utility functions. Kadaba and Jaffe <ref> [4] </ref> proposed a generalized form of power for for representing throughput-delay tradeoffs. This work focused on maximizing a global objective function based on the power obtained by individual VCs, e.g. - the sum of the individual powers.
