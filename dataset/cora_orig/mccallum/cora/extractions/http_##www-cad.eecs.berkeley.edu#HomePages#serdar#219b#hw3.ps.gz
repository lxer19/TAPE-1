Abstract: The variables of the function are t; w; x; z, and the above cover has 7 primes, numbered as shown. We want to compute an irredundant cover for the incompletely specified function, starting from the cover above. Let y i be a new variable for cube c i (as in class). (a) Write down the function g(y), by inspecting the cover above. (b) Compute the function g(y) using the modified tautology algorithm shown in class. Use the unate reduction technique during the recursion, where possible. (c) Construct matrix B corresponding to g(y) computed above. Find the minimum column cover of B and write down the corresponding irredundant cover. (d) Suppose we are given a redundant prime cover for a function. Give an example where greedily removing redundant cubes (i.e., removing one cube at a time until cover becomes irredundant) results in a cover that is not minimum.
