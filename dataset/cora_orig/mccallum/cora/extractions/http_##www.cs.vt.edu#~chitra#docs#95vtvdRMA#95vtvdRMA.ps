Abstract: Categorical time series data can not be effectively visualized and modeled using methods developed for ordinal data. The arbitrary mapping of categorical data to ordinal values can have a number of undesirable consequences. New techniques for visualizing and modeling categorical time series data are described, and examples are presented using computer and communications network traces.

Reference-contexts: In situations where it is important to consider the state vector as a unit, each unique vector is identified by a unique model state, which is a single categorical value <ref> [ADM92] </ref>. In either case, the reduction allows us to analyze a time series of scalar values. We use the term event to refer to the individual entries in the time series. <p> Upon a state change, the trace records a categorical data vector of length five, where each element in the vector records the state of one of the five philosophers. Each unique vector is mapped to a unique model state, which is a single categorical value <ref> [ADM92] </ref>. 3.4 Cache Hits Cache (or proxy) servers are used within organizations connected to the World Wide Web (WWW) to keep local copies of frequently used files from remote WWW sites.

Reference-contexts: But because the same 2 mapping must be used throughout the trace, a mapping that minimizes distances globally may still display very poor performance locally. In addition, it can be shown that determining this mapping, known as Optimal Linear Sequencing, is NP-hard <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. 2.2 Problem 2: Modeling We can not directly model categorical time series for the same reasons that we can not directly visualize them. That is, conventional models assume that ordinal relationships can be exploited.

Reference-contexts: the categorical periodogram, the i th model state in the MEG forms a line of slope 1=p with the preceding occurrence of that model state. 9 4.4 Correlation of Categorical Time Series 4.4.1 Components of Categorical Correlation Correlation for numeric data is defined based on the strength of the relationship <ref> [Ott88] </ref> between an independent and dependent variable. So for example, if the dependent variable gets larger when the independent variable gets larger, there is said to be a strong correlation between the two values. <p> It is a statistical test which tests the following null hypothesis: * H 0 : A trace synthesized from our model is generated from the same distribution that generated the original trace. We use the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test with correction for ties <ref> [Ott88] </ref>. The Kruskal-Wallis test is non-parametric test, so we do not need to make any distributional assumptions about the trace data. To validate our model using the Kruskal-Wallis test we first synthesize traces from our model. A synthesized trace is then compared with the original trace using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
