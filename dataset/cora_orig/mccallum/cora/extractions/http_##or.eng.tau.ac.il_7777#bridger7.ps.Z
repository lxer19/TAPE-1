Abstract: The critical design decisions in bridge design are made at the prelim inary design stage. This stage depends on the expertise of the designer, built up from extensive experience. Experience is difficult to acquire, and may be entirely lacking when new technology is introduced. As a result, there is little shareable and transferable collective design knowledge within the profession. This paper explores how preliminary design knowledge may be generated, up dated and used, utilizing techniques of machine learning from the field of artificial intelligence. A model of the preliminary design process is first presented as a se quence of five tasks and then specialized to the design of cable-stayed bridges. A computer tool serving as a design support system is described whose design follows the model of the preliminary design process, and a design example using the tool is presented. The key property of the system is its adaptive nature: it acquires knowl edge from information on existing bridges as well as from designs generated with the system, thereby continuously improving its performance. Future enhancements to the tool breadth and depth are offered.

Reference-contexts: Since different methods are appropriate for different purposes, it is important to select the appropriate technique for a practical knowledge acquisition problem. Following a particular method (Reich, 1991) leads to the selection of two existing learning programs,Cobweb (Fisher, 1987) and Protos <ref> (Bareiss, 1989) </ref>, for the acquisition of synthesis and redesign knowledge, as shown in column (c) of Figure 2. These two systems were enhanced to better suit their intended learning tasks; the enhanced systems are called Ecobweb (Reich and Fenves, 1992) and Eprotos, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Some recent studies deal with the optimization of various design properties such as member sizes and cable prestressing forces <ref> (Bhatti and Nasir Raza, 1985) </ref>. These studies assume a fixed bridge configuration and only affect local decisions. The selection of the bridge configuration is critical to the quality of the design.

Reference-contexts: The studies differ in the specific methods employed: a simple selection mechanism (Spencer et al, 1989), constraint satisfaction (Hua et al, 1990), or fuzzy sets (Leelawat et al, 1990). In a system for bridge design developed in Japan <ref> (Nishido et al, 1989) </ref>, the expert system approach is practically turned into an algorithm: the selection of bridge description properties is performed in a fixed order; and the final design is chosen from the alternatives generated by the expert system using rules based on subjective judgment.

Reference-contexts: These two systems were enhanced to better suit their intended learning tasks; the enhanced systems are called Ecobweb <ref> (Reich and Fenves, 1992) </ref> and Eprotos, respectively. The system that integrates Ecobweb and Eprotos is called Bridger. The architecture and flow of control of Bridger is illustrated in Figure 3. Bridger consists of two main sub systems: synthesis and redesign.

Reference-contexts: G. F. Fox stated in an interview that: "we should be developing databases, or knowledge bases, as well. Unit cost, technical data, historical costs, and failures could be put into these databases. Right now designers aren't able to get to the information that's out there" <ref> (Spector and Gifford, 1986) </ref>. We believe that the approach explored through Bridger goes beyond Fox's expectations.

Reference-contexts: One example of synthesis information can be a sketch depicting the weight of various types of steel bridges as a function of the span. Another form of synthesis information, also derived from limited experience, is rules such as <ref> (Troitsky, 1988, p. 236-237) </ref>: PREFER a stay inclination of 45 ffi ; or IF the main span is in the range of 450-490 ft (140-150 m), THEN PREFER a panel length of 65 ft (20 m). <p> Knowledge that may reduce the number of analyzes by focusing on promising design modi fications can be identified in the form of cause-and-effect or influence relationships. Often these influences are described in a textual form but can be translated into rules such as <ref> (Troitsky, 1988, p. 231) </ref>: IF rigidity of girder (DECK-MI) is reduced, THEN the stay stress (CABLE-ST-OUT-M) is increased. A set of such rules can be represented by a causal model.
