Title: ANL/MCS-TM-000 User's Guide for mpich, a Portable Implementation of MPI

Reference-contexts: Thus mpirun -np 10 myprog -p4dbg 20 -p4rdbg 20 results in program tracing information at a level of 20 being written to stdout during execution. For more information about what is printed at what levels, see the p4 Users' Guide <ref> [1] </ref>. If one specifies -p4norem on the command line, mpirun will not actually start the processes. The master process prints a message suggesting how the user can do it. The point of this option is to enable the user to start the remote processes under his favorite debugger, for instance.

Reference-contexts: One that we use is called Upshot, which is a derivative of Upshot [5], written in Tcl/Tk. A screen dump of Upshot in use is shown in Figure 1. It shows parallel time lines with process states, like one of the paraGraph <ref> [4] </ref>. The view can be zoomed in or out, horizontally or vertically, centered on any 11 point in the display chosen with the mouse. In Figure 1, the middle window has resulted from zooming in on the upper window at a chosen point to show more detail.

Reference-contexts: During execution, MPI Pcontrol can be used to suspend and restart logging operations. You can analyze the logfile produced at the end with a variety of tools. One that we use is called Upshot, which is a derivative of Upshot <ref> [5] </ref>, written in Tcl/Tk. A screen dump of Upshot in use is shown in Figure 1. It shows parallel time lines with process states, like one of the paraGraph [4]. <p> Include the desired Makefile fragment in your makefile: include $(MPIR_HOME)/profiling/lib/Makefile.logging (or #include $(MPIR_HOME)/profiling/lib/Makefile.logging if you are using the wildly incompatible BSD 4.4-derived make) 5.6 Examining event logs with upshot The original upshot was written in C and distributed several years ago <ref> [5] </ref>. To go with mpich, it has been completely rewritten by Ed Karrels to provide more robustness and flexibility. The current version resides in the directory profiling/upshot, and there is a symbolic link to the executable in mpich/bin.

Reference-contexts: You may use these commands instead of the `Makefile.in' versions, particularly for programs contained in a small number of files. In addition, they have a simple interface to the profiling and visualization libraries described in <ref> [6] </ref>. This is a program to compile or link MPI programs.
