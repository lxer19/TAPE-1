Abstract: In this paper we propose a new fast O(n 2 ) algorithm for solving Cauchy linear systems of equations. An a priori rounding error analysis, which provides bounds for the forward, backward and residual errors associated with the computed solution, indicates that for the class of totally positive Cauchy matrices the proposed algorithm is forward and backward stable, producing a remarkably high relative accuracy. In particular Hilbert linear systems, often considered to be too ill-conditioned to be attacked, actually can be rapidly solved with a favorably high precision. The results indicate to a close resemblance between the numerical properties of Cauchy matrices and the much-studied Vandermonde matrices. In particular, our proposed Cauchy solver is an analog of the the well-known Bjorck-Pereyra algorithm for Vandermonde systems, whose often favorable numerical properties motivated a number of authors, who extended this algorithm to the more general Vandermonde-related structures, and obtained favorable forward error bounds. Here we obtain also nice backward and residual error bounds for the Bjorck-Pereyra algorithm, and show that all these forward and backward stability results hold not just for Vandermonde and Vandermonde-related structures, but that they have counterparts for other classes of structured matrices, in particular for Cauchy matrices.

Reference-contexts: Backward stability. In order to interpret the backward error bound in theorem 4.3 recall the result of [GK50] (see also [K72]) that for a totally positive matrix all the entries of the L and U factors are positive. de Boor and Pincus <ref> [DBP77] </ref> used this fact to show that if during the elimination the entries of the computed factors ^ L; ^ U remain positive, then the backward error is pleasantly small : (A + A)^a = f; with jAj 3fl n A where fl n = nu : (5.4) which led them <p> A similar conclusion can be made for the BP algorithm for Vandermonde matrices.

Indeed, the analysis in [DBP77] is limited to the case where the computed factors ^ L and ^ U have only nonnegative entries. <p> A similar conclusion can be made for the BP algorithm for Vandermonde matrices.

Indeed, the analysis in [DBP77] is limited to the case where the computed factors ^ L and ^ U have only nonnegative entries. Since the condition number of the Hilbert matrices is known to grow exponentially with the size, already for small n we have k 2 (H) &gt; 1 q n u . <p> the solution ^a and to the triangular factors ^ L and ^ U computed by Gaussian elimination, admit the following componentwise bounds, jf A^aj 2fl n j ^ Ljj ^ U jj^aj; (5.5) jA ^ L ^ U j fl n j ^ Ljj ^ U j; (5.6) see, e.g., <ref> [DBP77] </ref>. Both bounds involve the matrix j ^ Ljj ^ U j, which can be much larger that j ^ L ^ U j, depending upon the sign pattern of the entries. <p> But again, the favorable bounds for Gaussian elimination are limited to the case where the computed factors ^ L and ^ U remain positive, whereas the residual bound (4.13) holds for the BKO algorithm, provided there are no overflows. Avoidance of pivoting. Recall the recommendation of <ref> [DBP77] </ref> to avoid pivoting with totally positive matrices when using standard Gaussian elimination, see, e.g. the bounds (5.4) and (5.7). Interestingly, in some instances this occurrence matches our recommendation on how to use ordering of the nodes to solve Cauchy systems in a stable manner.

Here we may note that (6.4), combined with the bound of <ref> [Hig87] </ref>, implies that if (2.8) holds, then the solution ^a of a Vandermonde system computed by the BP algorithm satisfies ka ^ak 1 5n n fl (V (x 1:n ); f ) u + O (u 2 ): (6.6) The latter bound proves that the BP algorithm is also effectively stable <p> This extends the 17 prior N.J.Higham's result <ref> [Hig87] </ref> on the favorable forward accuracy of the BP algorithm for Vandermonde matrices. The obtained results were used to illustrate the relationship of the high accuracy of the BKO algorithm to the concept of effective well-conditioning.

Reference-contexts: The Bjorck-Pereyra algorithm. Along with many interesting algebraic properies, C (x 1:n ; y 1:n ) and V (x 1:n ) have many often favorable numerical properties, which, however, have been much more studied and undersotood for Vandermonde matrices [BP70], [TG81], [CF88], [Hig87], [Hig88], [Hig90], [RO91], [CR92], <ref> [V93] </ref>, [GK93], as compared to the analysis of numerical issues related to Cauchy matrices [GK90], [GK93]. In particular, most of the above listed papers is devoted to the analysis and extensions of the fast O (n 2 ). Bjorck-Pereyra algorithm for Vandermonde systems [BP70], [GVL89]. <p> This conclusion justifies the motivation of [CF88], and gives a theoretical support for the numerical examples in <ref> [V93] </ref>. Moreover, our experiments indicate that the numerical behavior of the Parker-Traub inversion algorithm depends upon the effective well-conditioning of a Vandermonde system to be solved.

Reference-contexts: Since the condition number of the Hilbert matrices is known to grow exponentially with the size, already for small n we have k 2 (H) &gt; 1 q n u . Then in accordance with <ref> [W68] </ref> the matrix H will likely lose during computation not only its total positivity, but also the weaker property of being positive definite.

Reference-contexts: Another challenging problem was to give a theoretical support for the favorable numerical properties of the Bjorck-Pereyra algorithm by performing an a priori rounding error analysis; a class of Vander-monde systems with a nice error bound was identified in [Hig87]. Here we may recall Wilkinson's <ref> [W71] </ref> advocation not to give " ... much importance to the precise error bounds obtained by a priori error analysis," even they are often impractically large, they can "expose the potential instabilities, if any, of an algorithm, so that hopefully from the insight thus obtained one might be led to improved
