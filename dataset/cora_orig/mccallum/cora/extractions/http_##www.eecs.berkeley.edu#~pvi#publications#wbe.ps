Abstract: To meet the increasing demand on wireless networks, there has been intense effort in the past decade on developing multi-user receiver structures which mitigate interference between users in spread-spectrum systems. While much of this research is performed at the physical layer, the appropriate power control and choice of signature sequences in conjunction with multiuser receivers and the resulting network capacity is not well understood. In this paper we will focus on a single cell and consider both the uplink and downlink scenarios and assume a synchronous CDMA (S-CDMA) system. We characterize the capacity of a single cell with both the optimal linear receiver (MMSE receiver) and matched filter receiver structures. The capacity of the system is the maximum number of users per unit processing gain admissible in the system such that each user has its quality-of-service (QoS) requirement (expressed in terms of its desired signal-to-interference ratio) met. This allows us to describe the capacity through a simple effective bandwidth characterization. Users are allowed in the system if and only if the sum of their effective bandwidths is less than the processing gain of the system. The effective bandwidth of each user is a monotonic function of its QoS requirement. We identify the "optimal" signature sequences and power control strategies so that the users meet their QoS requirement. We propose a simple construction scheme for the "optimal" signature sequences that we identify. We also characterize the effect of transmit power constraints on the capacity. fl Research supported by the National Science Foundation under grants NCR 94-22513 and IRI 95-05561.

Reference-contexts: We are currently working on verifying this conjecture. A Definitions and Relevant Results from Theory of Majorization In this appendix we collect together relevant definitions and results from the theory of ma-jorization. All of these results can be found in the comprehensive reference on majorization <ref> [9] </ref>. Majorization makes precise the vague notion that the components of a vector x are "less spread out" or "more nearly equal" than are the components of a vector y by the statement x is majorized by y. <p> Using the observation in (65), for any Schur-concave function and for any vector x 2 R n (x) (x) where x = P n n ; i=1 x i P n n . A well known structure of Schur-convex functions is the following result (Theorem 3.C.1 in <ref> [9] </ref>): If g : R ! R is convex then the symmetric convex function (x) = P n i=1 g (x i ) is Schur-convex. <p> It is well known that the sum of diagonal elements of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. When the matrix is symmetric the precise relationship between the diagonal elements and the eigenvalues is that of majorization (Theorem 9.B.1, <ref> [9] </ref>): For every symmetric matrix H with diagonal elements h 1 ; : : : ; h n and eigenvalues 1 ; : : : ; n we have ( 1 ; : : : ; n ) majorizes (h 1 ; : : : ; h n ) (66) That <p> : : : ; n we have ( 1 ; : : : ; n ) majorizes (h 1 ; : : : ; h n ) (66) That h and cannot be compared by an ordering stronger than majorization is the conse quence of the following converse (Theorem 9.B.2, <ref> [9] </ref>): Theorem A.1 If h 1 h n and 1 n are 2n numbers satisfying h in R n , then there exists a real symmetric matrix H with diagonal elements h 1 ; : : : ; h n and eigenvalues 1 ; : : : ; n . <p> The proof of Theorem A.1 suggests a way to construct such a symmetric matrix H and this is of importance in constructing the WBE sequences. Hence, we outline the proof below. We need the following lemma first (Lemma 9.B.3 in <ref> [9] </ref>). <p> Before we proceed to outline the proof of Theorem A.1, we need the following technical lemma (Theorem 5.A.10 in <ref> [9] </ref>): Lemma A.2 If x y then there exist c 1 ; : : : ; c n1 such that y [1] c 1 y [2] c n1 y [n] and We are now ready to outline the proof of Theorem A.1.

Reference-contexts: We identify the "optimal" signature sequences and the "minimal" transmit powers of the users to admit the maximum number of users in the system. We also provide a simple algorithm to construct the "optimal" signature sequences that we have identi fied. In <ref> [16] </ref>, the authors consider the scenario when the signature sequences of the users are independent and randomly chosen. They show that the SIR of the users of such a large system converges (in probability) and analyze the capacity of the system based on the value to which the SIR converges. <p> It is well known that the MMSE receiver is the optimum linear receiver structure, optimum in the sense of maximizing the SIR of each user. While there are many derivations of the structure of the MMSE receiver (see [8], <ref> [16] </ref> for example) c 1 ; : : : ; c M , we give an elementary derivation of the same as the argument of a problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex set below (this will also aid us in developing notation to be used in the characterization <p> In general, if the sequences chosen are s 1 ; : : : ; s M let S = [s 1 : : : s M ] and denote p S as the component-wise minimal power choice.

The results in [16] are asymptotic and are valid for a large system (i.e., a system with a large processing gain and large number of users). <p> This was achieved using equal received power and the WBE sequences described earlier. However, this "symmetrization" can also be achieved asymptotically when random sequences are used, since it is shown in <ref> [16] </ref> that the SIR's of all users will converge to the same number. But maximizing the minimum SIR's is equivalent to maximizing the number of users in a system with given equal SIR requirements. <p> In <ref> [16] </ref> the authors show that in a large system, ff users per unit processing College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/6 13 gain have their SIR requirements met if and only if ff &lt; 1 fi . <p> The simple scheme of constructing WBE sequences for any M L outlined in Appendix B makes this choice of signature sequences more appealing. College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/6 16 Again, it is interesting to compare the results with the performance under random sequences. It is shown in <ref> [16] </ref> that with a power constraint P , the asymptotic capacity per degree of freedom achieved by the MMSE receiver is: 1 + fi G 2 which is strictly less than that with optimal sequences, when the power constraint is finite.

Reference-contexts: Let v 1 ; : : : ; v L 2 R 1fiM be orthonormal eigenvectors of P corre sponding to the eigenvalue 1 L i=1 1+fi i . Recently, in <ref> [20] </ref> the authors provide a sim ple (recursive) algorithm to construct these eigenvectors given fi 1 ; : : : ; fi M satisfying (35). <p> k+1 ; : : : ; e M g which has dimension L k having the property M X fi i s i s t 0 M X p i A 0 0 # Since P M fi i fi k+1 from (37), we can appeal to the algorithm in <ref> [20] </ref> (as in Case 1 above) to construct sequences s k+1 ; : : : ; s M having the property (38) above. Now we let the powers p i = c fi i 1+fi i where c is a constant equal to (Lk) 2 P M fi i .

Reference-contexts: first identified in [10] (but in their context the College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/6 8 sequences were in f1; 1g L ) and the authors referred to such s 1 ; : : : ; s M as WBE sequences, sequences that meet the so-called Welch Bound Equality (see <ref> [21] </ref>). WBE sequences have also appeared in [11] in an information theoretic setting. The proof of the existence of WBE sequences is missing and construction of WBE sequences is not exhibited for every M L in [11] and [10].

Reference-contexts: To meet these challenges, there have been intense efforts in developing more sophisticated physical layer communication techniques. A significant thrust of work has been on developing multi-user receiver structures which mitigate the interference between users in spread spectrum systems. (See for example <ref> [19, 6, 7, 22, 8, 12, 14] </ref>.) Despite significant work done in the area, there is still much debate about the network capacity of the various approaches to deal with multi-user interference in spread-spectrum and multi-antenna systems. <p> Though any choice of linear receiver is allowed in this framework, in practice, two linear receivers are of particular interest: the MMSE receiver which is the best linear receiver (in the sense of maximizing the SIR of each user, see <ref> [22, 8, 12, 14] </ref>),and the conventional matched filter receiver. We consider each receiver separately and characterize the capacity of the system. Our main results, which hold both for the uplink and downlink, are as follows: College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/6 3 1.
