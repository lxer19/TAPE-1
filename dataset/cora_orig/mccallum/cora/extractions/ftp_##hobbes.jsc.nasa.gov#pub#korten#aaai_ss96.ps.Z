Abstract: For the last several years we have used a layered architecture known as 3T (for three tiers) to integrate deliberative planning and situated reasoning (Miller 1986; Firby 1987; Gat, Firby, & Miller 1989; Bonasso, An-tonisse, & Slack 1992; Miller, Slack, & Elsaesser 1994). One fundamental result of the use of this architecture is that the planning tier deals with information at a level of abstraction greatly removed from that of the continuously acting robot. As a result, the planner can ignore the ramifications of or recover from (replan, reassign agents, etc.) incomplete information available at the onset of planning more easily than if the planner were directly connected to the robot. We feel this is an important tenet to be used when investigating robot planning with incomplete information. The details of the 3 T architecture are motivated by a variety of considerations involved in placing goal-directed robots in natural environments. A situated robot confronts at least three basic problems: sensor limitations including range and resolution limits, noise, and occlusions, limits on computation time due to deadlines imposed by the environment, and the fundamentally unpredictable aspects of real environments | many things are under the control of other agents and processes. Furthermore, a robot should be able to accept new tasks and information about the world at any time. We do not want an architecture that requires a robot to be reprogrammed each time its goals change. Sensor limitations and the need to respond quickly to the environment demand that some control processes use real-time feedback. At the same time, the need to shift flexibly between tasks as new goals arise suggests the need for a library of plans for different tasks, or the ability to construct new plans as the need arises. Sensor limitations also demand that a system use memory Taken together, we believe these requirements lead to a fundamentally different mode of plan use than is assumed in many other AI architectures. The classical view of a plan in AI is something akin to a computer program, that is, a data structure that can be translated into action by a simple execution mechanism. 3 T views plans as more flexible structures built from abstract actions that need a more complex mechanism to translate them into detailed, rapidly changing activities in the world (Agre & Chapman 1987). At one level, the system must embody feedback control to deal with sensor and actuator error while, at another level, the system must be able to build plans and reason about the future to deal with changing sets of interacting goals. Integrating these disparate views of control requires a mediating level.
