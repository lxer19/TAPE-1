Title: Tracking Point of View in Narrative  
Author: Janyce M. Wiebe 
Affiliation: New Mexico State University  
Abstract: Third-person fictional narrative text is composed not only of passages that objectively narrate events, but also of passages that present characters' thoughts, perceptions, and inner states. Such passages take a character's psychological point of view. A language understander must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive examinations of naturally occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: POV also has important implications for discourse processing. Discussion of this topic is deferred until section 14. Sentences that present 1 the attitudes of someone who is not the writer appear in genres other than third-person fictional narrative text, such as newspaper articles and text 5 books <ref> (Banfield 1982) </ref>, even if we might prefer another term than "represented thought" for such sentences. Thus, the problem of tracking POV arises for these other genres as well. <p> In the above definitions, LastSC, LastActiveCharacter, SC, and ActiveCharacter are sets, and PreviousSCs is a set of sets. This is because a subjective sentence can represent the shared psychological POV of more than one physical character <ref> (Banfield 1982) </ref>. <p> Subjective elements indicate that a sentence is a represented thought (this statement is qualified later in this section and in section 10 below). Subjective elements are linguistic elements that express emotions, uncertainty, evaluations, and other kinds of subjectivity <ref> (Banfield 1982) </ref> (they are discussed in detail below in section 9). Examples are evaluative terms such as `the old bag' (Banfield 1982) and evidentials such as `evidently' and `apparently' (Dolezel 1973). <p> Subjective elements are linguistic elements that express emotions, uncertainty, evaluations, and other kinds of subjectivity <ref> (Banfield 1982) </ref> (they are discussed in detail below in section 9). Examples are evaluative terms such as `the old bag' (Banfield 1982) and evidentials such as `evidently' and `apparently' (Dolezel 1973). In the following passage, a subjective element indicates that the SC of a private-state sentence is not the experiencer of the private state.

Reference-contexts: In the following passage, in contrast, potential subjective elements that are not necessarily subjective appear when there isn't an expected subjective character. This passage is of the type that Banfield has characterized as having an empty center <ref> (Banfield 1987) </ref>; 6 it describes perceptions and impressions that one would have if observing the scene, but no character is present to whom to attribute them.

Reference-contexts: Point of View 2.1 Introduction In face-to-face conversation, an utterance is understood with respect to the situation in which the conversation takes place <ref> (Barwise and Perry 1983) </ref>. Thus, deictic expressions such as `now', `here', `come', `go', and `just ahead' derive their meanings from the time and place of the utterance (Fillmore 1975, Lyons 1977).

Reference-contexts: These situations must be distinguished from the situation, occurring with represented thoughts, in which there is a "projected here" and a "projected now" of events that are being thought about, and from the situation in represented perception in which there is a "projected here" of events being perceived <ref> (Bruder et al. 1986, Rapaport et al. 1989ab) </ref>. An important area of future research is investigating interactions among tracking POV, recognizing discourse structure, and anaphora resolution. I am currently focusing on discourse structure within subjective contexts.

Reference-contexts: Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally. In fact, we have performed psychological experiments <ref> (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and forthcoming) </ref> that did establish such a link. Specifically, through manipulation of paragraph breaks in naturally occurring passages, the experiments showed that readers' interpretations of private-state sentences are influenced by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm. 8.3.2 Subjective Elements. <p> Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself. Finally, as mentioned in section 8.3.1, we have performed psychological experiments that showed that readers' interpretations of private-state sentences are affected by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm <ref> (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and forthcoming) </ref>. We are continuing this line of research with psychological experiments of other aspects of the algorithm. 32 13. Relation to Anaphora Resolution A question likely to arise in the reader's mind is how tracking POV and anaphora resolution are related.

Importance of Tracking Point of View The importance to narrative understanding of recognizing characters' intentions has long been recognized in AI <ref> (see, for example, Wilensky 1983 and Dyer 1983) </ref>. To perform plan recognition, the reader must, among other things, realize when character's intentions are being communicated; this may involve realizing that a particular sentence is subjective rather than objective. <p> as work in plan recognition in conversation, see, e.g., Allen and Per-rault 1980; in user modeling, see, e.g., the papers in the special issue of Computational Linguistics on user modeling 1988; and in dynamically constructing nested-belief environments during understanding, see, e.g., Wilks and Bien 1983) and character's attitudes in stories <ref> (see, e.g., Wilensky 1983 and Dyer 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Examples of sentences with such private-state nouns are: (10) The feeling went away. (11) The pain increased. (12) His astonishment grew. 4. The experiencers and actors (i.e., particular case fillers <ref> (Fillmore 1968) </ref>) of the states of affairs of items (2) and (3). Because a single action might have more than one actor, and a single state might have more than one experiencer, each of these is a set.

Reference-contexts: Each is an expected subjective character only in certain text situations. The idea of keeping track of entities evoked in the text in order to interpret later sentences is due to work on anaphora resolution <ref> (e.g., Sidner 1983 and Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We shall limit our scope in this paper mainly to two classes of subjective sentences, one containing those Banfield calls "represented thoughts" and "represented perceptions", and the other containing those I call "private-state reports". We will not consider represented speech at all <ref> (Jespersen 1924, Banfield 1982) </ref>, due to its complexity, and only toward the end of the paper (section 11) will we consider a variant of private-state reports: subjective sentences about private-state actions. <p> As well, we will not try to account for fiction 4 that is experimental in its manipulation of POV. Finally, we will only consider narrative sentences in which the tenses are "shifted" <ref> (Jespersen 1924) </ref>, that is, in which the simple past is used for the narrative present, and the past perfective is used for the narrative past. Note that it is not difficult to find published third-person texts that satisfy these criteria. 3.

Reference-contexts: While objective sentences are unquestionably true in the fictional world, subjective sentences reflect the subjective character's beliefs, which may be false in the fictional world <ref> (Uspensky 1973, Kuroda 1976, Cohn 1978, Banfield 1982) </ref>. A striking example is the following: (8) This was David's boy. [Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 91] Sentence (8) is actually about a female character named "Casey".

Reference-contexts: The former is a pragmatic issue, concerning the use of a sentence to present objective or subjective information about the fictional world <ref> (Kuroda 1976) </ref>. The latter is a semantic issue, concerning the word senses of lexical items in the sentence. For instance, (5) below can be used to objectively narrate a past action or to portray a character's thought of one.

Reference-contexts: Varieties of private states include intellectual ones, such as someone believing, wondering, or knowing something; emotive ones, such as someone hating something or being afraid; and perceptual ones, such as someone seeing or hearing something. Thus, private states are states that are not open to objective observation or verification <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>. To refer to a private state p and its components, we shall write: ps (p; experiencer; attitude; object) where experiencer is the person in state p, and attitude is know, believe, see, or whatever sort of private state p is. <p> Note that each of the following is about a private state: Mary was afraid of the dark. The darkness made Mary afraid. Wiebe 1990 gives a list of private-state terms, noting which syntactic roles the experiencer fills in various clause structures <ref> (this material is drawn from Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>. Section 6.3.1 gives the categorization of states of affairs used in this work. 3. <p> Table 1 gives some examples. Note that private-state terms appearing in certain types of constituents cannot be used to report private states. An example is a manner adverbial <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>, such as the italicized portion of "Japheth turned the book over in a puzzled manner." (There are others addressed in Wiebe 1990, but due to space limitations, we shall ignore them in this paper.) The phrase "in a puzzled manner" does not report a private state, but <p> in (25.2) 2.2 Nouns such as `old bag' in (25.3) 2.3 Adverbs such as `oddly' and `incredibly' 2.4 Auxiliary verbs and phrases that express judgments of obligation, such as `had better', `ought to', `should', and `be supposed to' 2.5 Adverbs such as `scarcely' and `hardly' (when used as minimizer subjuncts <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>), as in "She could hardly be expected to live there" 3 Elements that express a lack of knowledge 3.1 Subordinators such as `whoever' and `whatever', when used in reference to particular individuals, as in "Whatever it was, it had flown by quickly" 3.2 Adjectival phrases such as <p> `must have', `appear to be', `as if', `as though', and `look', as in "He looked like he might cry" 6.3 Hedges, e.g., adverbs such as `more or less' and `sort of' when used as modifiers of adjectives and adverbs, as in "It was more or less green", or as adverbials <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>, as in "The man more or less held a large stretch of the border" 6.4 Evidentials that address expectations 6.4.1 Signal that expectations have been met, such as `of course' (when used as an emphasizer subjunct (Quirk et al. 1985)) as in "John of course sat down" <p> in "It was more or less green", or as adverbials <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>, as in "The man more or less held a large stretch of the border" 6.4 Evidentials that address expectations 6.4.1 Signal that expectations have been met, such as `of course' (when used as an emphasizer subjunct (Quirk et al. 1985)) as in "John of course sat down" 6.4.2 Signal that expectations have not been met. Examples are adverbs such as `just', `merely', and `only' (when used as attitude diminishers (Quirk et al. 1985)), as in "He just sat and drank" (it was expected that he would do <p> 6.4.1 Signal that expectations have been met, such as `of course' (when used as an emphasizer subjunct <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>) as in "John of course sat down" 6.4.2 Signal that expectations have not been met. Examples are adverbs such as `just', `merely', and `only' (when used as attitude diminishers (Quirk et al. 1985)), as in "He just sat and drank" (it was expected that he would do something "more" than sit and drink) 7 Adverbials that are conjuncts, which connect units of discourse (Quirk et al. 1985) (i.e., cue phrases; Reichman 1985, Grosz and Sidner 1986, Cohen 1987). <p> Examples are adverbs such as `just', `merely', and `only' (when used as attitude diminishers <ref> (Quirk et al. 1985) </ref>), as in "He just sat and drank" (it was expected that he would do something "more" than sit and drink) 7 Adverbials that are conjuncts, which connect units of discourse (Quirk et al. 1985) (i.e., cue phrases; Reichman 1985, Grosz and Sidner 1986, Cohen 1987).
