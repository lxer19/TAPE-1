Abstract: Utility theory offers an elegant and powerful theoretical framework for design and analysis of autonomous adaptive communication networks. Routing of messages in such networks presents a real-time instance of a multi-criterion quasi-optimization problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper, we examine several heuristic decision functions that can be used to guide messages along a near-optimal (e.g., minimum delay) path in a large network. We present an analysis of properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics. In particular, we identify the conditions under which one such utility-theoretic heuristic function is guaranteed to route messages along an optimal (minimum delay) path in a network with uniform load except for a single hotspot (when it is assumed that the network load stays z The authors wish to thank Yong Zhao, Karthik Balakrishnan, Rajesh Parekh, and Chun-Hsien Chen (all doctoral students in Computer Science at Iowa State University), and Mary Oman (a post-doctoral fellow at Ames Laboratory) for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of the paper.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by these considerations, a class of adaptive heuristic routing algorithms have been developed over the past few years <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. Experiments demonstrate that such algorithms have a number of interesting properties including: automatic load balancing and message delay minimization. <p> Ideally, it must adequately summarize the load values in large regions of the network as viewed from a given node. These considerations (among others) led us to define a view, V k , which is maintained in every node in the network <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] </ref>. In a rectangular grid network, this view consists of four components, one for each of the four directions north, south, east, and west. <p> Given the recursive nature of view computation, views take a certain time to stabilize after major load changes in the network. This requires a careful choice of frequency of view update etc. The reader is refered to <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] </ref> for a discussion of this and related issues. Assumption 4 In the discussion that follows, we assume that sufficient time has elapsed for the view computation to stabilize before the view is used in the computation of cost estimates using E d k (:). <p> The latter is very similar in spirit to utility functions that were developed (mostly based on intuition rather than sound mathematical foundations) and experimentally studied in <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. Indeed, the study of utility-theoretic heuristics which is described in this paper, was, at least in part, motivated by a desire to formulate the heuristc routing functions and to understand the experimental results in more precise mathematical terms.
