Abstract: This paper proposes a novel concept of multidestination message passing mechanism for wormhole k-ary n-cube networks. Similar to the familiar car-pool concept, this mechanism allows data to be delivered to or picked-up from multiple nodes with a single message-passing step. Such messages can propagate along any valid path in a wormhole network conforming to the underlying base routing scheme (deterministic or adaptive). The mechanism requires very little modification to the existing routers and can have unicast message-passing as a subset operation. A base-routing-conformed-path (BRCP) model to implement this mechanism is presented. The model is illustrated for several commonly-used routing schemes and the associated deadlock-freedom properties are analyzed. Using this model a set of new algorithms are proposed and evaluated to implement broadcasting and multicasting. It is shown that these algorithms can considerably reduce the latency of these collective communication operations compared to the Umesh (unicast-based multicast) [22] and the Hamiltonian-Path-based [20] schemes. A very interesting and counter-intuitive result is presented which shows that a mul-ticast can be implemented with reduced or near-constant latency as the number of processors participating in the multicast increases beyond a certain number. It is also shown that the BRCP model can take advantage of routing-adaptivity to reduce the latency of these operations further. These results are the first ones in the wormhole-routing literature to propose broadcasting and multicasting schemes with such reduced latency on networks with deterministic and adaptive routing. The multidestination mechanism and the BRCP model establish a new foundation to provide fast and scalable collective communication support on wormhole-routed systems.

Reference-contexts: The model allows both unicast and multidestination messages to co-exist in a system. This model does not require any more virtual channels than needed by the base routing. However, it requires an absorb-and-forward mechanism at each router and a few additional virtual consumption channels <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, this model can be easily incorporated into near-future wormhole systems with very little additional cost. In the first part of this paper, we present the BRCP model together with its formal definitions and demonstrate how the set of BRCP paths can be determined for popular routing schemes. <p> Thus, the consumption channel requirement for a system with virtual lane support remains the same as that of its underlying deadlock-free routing R, as indicated in Theorem 4. However, more consumption channels may be used to reduce blocking and obtain better performance <ref> [1] </ref>. For weakly adaptive routing schemes like the one proposed by Duato [13] the BRCP model allows paths conforming to its subset routing R 0 , as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination. This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange <ref> [3, 4, 22, 33, 35] </ref>. Each of these phases encounters a communication start-up cost which is quite high on current systems (5.0-40.0 microsec). Thus, these operations are getting implemented on current systems with considerable high latency. <p> Hence, the BRCP Model is a feasible solution for current and near-future generation wormhole-routed systems. 4 Broadcasting To demonstrate the potential of the BRCP model, we consider two commonly used collective communication operations: one-to-all broadcasting <ref> [2, 3, 9, 18] </ref> and one-to-many multicasting [7, 14, 22].

Reference-contexts: Though Hamiltonian path-based routing demonstrates significant potential for collective communication operations, its development has been along a different direction than the conventional development of wormhole-routed systems. In the past, wormhole-routed systems started with e-cube routing [12].

Reference-contexts: For example, the set of non-adaptive channels may correspond to e-cube routing. In this case, fully-adaptive routing can be supported with two virtual channels. Such routing schemes are identified as weakly adaptive <ref> [6] </ref> where a blocked message can wait, indefinitely, for only a strict subset of the legal links at an intermediate node. Let the routing constraints on these set of legal links be defined as R .

Reference-contexts: It is to be noted that a similar but restricted method of using only column-path has also been independently proposed recently by Boppana, Chalasani, and Raghavendra <ref> [7] </ref>. The BRCP model can be applied to higher dimensional e-cube systems. Consider an e-cube routed 3D system with x, y, and z dimensions where unicast routing gets done from lower dimension x to highest dimension z. <p> This leads to added dependency and three consumption channels may not be sufficient as shown in Figure 4c. In such cases four consumption channels per node are needed. Similar solutions have also been proposed in <ref> [7] </ref> to provide two consumption channels per node for deadlock freedom in column-path routing. Since the BRCP model provides more flexibility like RC paths more consumption channels are required. <p> Hence, the BRCP Model is a feasible solution for current and near-future generation wormhole-routed systems. 4 Broadcasting To demonstrate the potential of the BRCP model, we consider two commonly used collective communication operations: one-to-all broadcasting [2, 3, 9, 18] and one-to-many multicasting <ref> [7, 14, 22] </ref>.

First we emphasize on designing efficient broadcasting algorithms for 2D E-cube systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a multidestination message with a single destination is equivalent to a unicast message. There are different ways the ids of multiple destinations can be encoded into the header flits of a multidestination message <ref> [10] </ref>. In this paper, we emphasize on all-destination encoding due to its simplicity for implementation. The multidestination mechanism is quite general and can be used with different functionality to implement different collective communication operations [29]. For example, a multi-destination multicast worm can be used to implement multicast/broadcast. <p> Figure 2 illustrates the basic principles of multidestination mechanism with a multidestination multicast worm. An example worm with three destinations (d1, d2, and d4) on a linear array of processors is illustrated. This worm carries five data flits (A-E). The worm uses all-destination encoding <ref> [10] </ref> and three flits are used to encode the destination addresses. These destinations are ordered by the source such that the message is intended to travel along the destinations in the order d1, d2, and d4.

Next, let us consider planar-adaptive routing <ref> [11] </ref>. Figure 3c shows the feasible BRCP paths for a 2D system supporting planar adaptive routing. In addition to the BRCP paths for e-cube routing, planar-adaptive provides flexibility for a multidestination worm to get routed along a diagonal of a plane. <p> Similar paths can be derived for other combinations of planes in 3D and higher dimensional systems. In the current version of planar-adaptive routing <ref> [11] </ref> some ambiguity exists for unicast message-passing with respect to selection of virtual channels along dimension d i+1 in adaptive plane A i .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend in building future parallel systems due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead <ref> [12, 25] </ref>. Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category. Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. <p> Though Hamiltonian path-based routing demonstrates significant potential for collective communication operations, its development has been along a different direction than the conventional development of wormhole-routed systems. In the past, wormhole-routed systems started with e-cube routing <ref> [12] </ref>.

On top of this, a routing scheme may or may not use virtual channels for deadlock-freedom. <p> With a consistent channel selection policy (ei-ther sticking with virtual channel d i+1;0 or d i+1;1 ) such deadlock scenarios can be easily avoided for multidestination messages. We next apply the BRCP framework to fully-adaptive routing proposed by Duato <ref> [13] </ref>. This routing algorithm supports fully-adaptive unicast routing by supporting a set of adaptive and non-adaptive channels. The non-adaptive channels are known as escape channels on which a blocked message can wait indefinitely without leading to deadlock. For example, the set of non-adaptive channels may correspond to e-cube routing. <p> This indicates that any valid BRCP path under routing R is also a valid path under routing R 0 Based on the above result, let us apply the BRCP model to a 2D mesh supporting fully adaptive routing by Duato <ref> [13] </ref>. Assume this system supports e-cube routing as R 0 . Under this situation, as shown in Fig. 3d, we will have BRCP paths as R, C, and RC. These paths are similar to those for e-cube routing, as shown in Fig. 3a. <p> However, more consumption channels may be used to reduce blocking and obtain better performance [1]. For weakly adaptive routing schemes like the one proposed by Duato <ref> [13] </ref> the BRCP model allows paths conforming to its subset routing R 0 , as discussed earlier. Worms along a given dimension and entering a router along both adaptive as well as escape channels can be allocated a single consumption channel. <p> In this case the adaptivity does not help in reducing broadcast latency. In the next section we will show that D paths can in fact help in reducing latency for multicast operation.

Similar paths can also be enumerated for higher dimensional e-cube routed systems. Let us consider the turn-model <ref> [16] </ref> which is an adaptive routing scheme without using virtual channels.

Now let us consider the turn-model <ref> [16] </ref> with west-first non-minimal routing. As shown in Fig. 7b, one-to-all broadcasting can be implemented in just one step using a fNMWFg scheme.

For higher dimensional systems with turn model we consider the counterpart of the west-first routing: all-but-one-negative-first routing <ref> [16] </ref>. In the absence of the BRCP model, it takes dlog 2 (k 1 k 2 )e communication steps to support broadcasting in a k 1 fi k 2 mesh using unicast message passing [22].

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is essential to implement these operations with reduced latency. In order to reduce the number of phases to implement collective communication operations, Ni has proposed a Hamiltonian Path-based scheme <ref> [21] </ref>. This scheme uses a modified router organization to support propagation of multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations) and allows a message to be consumed at a destination node while being forwarded to the next node concurrently. <p> These algorithms are developed and evaluated for 2D and 3D wormhole networks with different routing schemes. We show that the BRCP model reduces the latency of these operations considerably compared to Umesh [22] and Hamiltonian-path-based <ref> [21] </ref> schemes. As the number of participating destinations in a multicast increases beyond certain number, we show that the BRCP model allows us to steadily reduce the multicast latency. With increase in adaptivity in the underlying routing, we also show that multicast operations can be implemented with reduced latency. <p> The injection and consumption channels are also known as internal channels in the literature [25]. consumption channels. 3 2.2 Multidestination Mechanism The concept of wormhole message passing mechanism with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni in <ref> [21] </ref>. The mechanism was used on wormhole networks with Hamiltonian-Path-based routing to support fast multicast/broadcast operations. We first describe this mechanism briefly and then show how it can be extended to other routing schemes. <p> Since the BRCP model provides more flexibility like RC paths more consumption channels are required. Similar arguments can also be used to show that Hamiltonian-path-based routing with dual paths <ref> [21] </ref> requires two consumption channels per node for deadlock freedom. The above results, derived for 2D mesh supporting e-cube routing, can easily be extended to k-ary n-cube topology and other routing schemes.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination. This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange <ref> [3, 4, 22, 33, 35] </ref>. Each of these phases encounters a communication start-up cost which is quite high on current systems (5.0-40.0 microsec). Thus, these operations are getting implemented on current systems with considerable high latency. <p> In particular, we present algorithms for two commonly used collective communication operations, broadcast and multi-cast. These algorithms are developed and evaluated for 2D and 3D wormhole networks with different routing schemes. We show that the BRCP model reduces the latency of these operations considerably compared to Umesh <ref> [22] </ref> and Hamiltonian-path-based [21] schemes. As the number of participating destinations in a multicast increases beyond certain number, we show that the BRCP model allows us to steadily reduce the multicast latency. <p> Hence, the BRCP Model is a feasible solution for current and near-future generation wormhole-routed systems. 4 Broadcasting To demonstrate the potential of the BRCP model, we consider two commonly used collective communication operations: one-to-all broadcasting [2, 3, 9, 18] and one-to-many multicasting <ref> [7, 14, 22] </ref>. In this section we show how the BRCP model can be used to implement broadcasting on k-ary n-cube systems with reduced latency. In the next section, we discuss multicasting. First we emphasize on designing efficient broadcasting algorithms for 2D E-cube systems. <p> In the absence of the BRCP model, it takes dlog 2 (k 1 k 2 )e communication steps to support broadcasting in a k 1 fi k 2 mesh using unicast message passing <ref> [22] </ref>. This leads to: Theorem 6 One-to-all broadcasting from an arbitrary source in a k 1 fi k 2 wormhole-routed mesh can be implemented in two communication steps under the BRCP model if the underlying routing is e-cube, planar-adaptive, or fully-adaptive. <p> Now the nodes in this cube can cover nodes along the fourth dimension with an additional communication step. This leads to a broadcasting scheme with (n + 1) steps. By using unicast-based approach <ref> [22] </ref>, one-to-all broadcasting in a k-ary n-mesh takes dlog 2 (k n )e steps. This leads to: Theorem 7 One-to-all broadcasting from an arbitrary source node in a k-ary n-mesh system supporting e-cube, planar-adaptive, or fully-adaptive routing can be implemented in (n + 1) communication steps under the BRCP model. <p> If s is not a member in L m , we have jL s m j = jL m + 1j. Otherwise, both sets are identical. The first phase involves performing unicast-based multicast (known as Umesh algorithm <ref> [22] </ref>) on the set L s m using point-to-point (single destination) messages. This phase takes dlog 2 (jL s m j)e communication steps. If the source happens to be the sole level m leader then this phase is eliminated. <p> Since only R and C paths are available, no further grouping of leaders in L 2 is possible under either ordering. scheme with R and C paths. After the grouping is over, the multicast takes place as follows. In the first phase, the Umesh algorithm <ref> [22] </ref> is used to cover three level 2 leaders in two communication steps. The second phase involves level 2 leaders sending multidestination worms along C paths. In the last phase, all level 1 leaders send multidestination worms along R paths. Thus, the multicast is finished in four steps. <p> For a fair comparison 2nv consumption channels were assumed for both multidestination and unicast message-passing. Each experiment was carried out 40 times to obtain average results. 6.1 Broadcasting 6.1.1 Effect of System Size and Adaptivity size increases, both Umesh <ref> [22] </ref> and Hamiltonian-path-based schemes [20] incur more latency to implement broadcast. However, the multidestination based schemes keep the latency almost constant across different system sizes. The HL scheme with RC paths and the two-step broadcasting with turn model demonstrate identical performance.

Reference-contexts: Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. In order to support these paradigms, these systems need fast implementation of collective communication operations (broadcast, multicast, global combine, and barrier synchronization) <ref> [23, 29] </ref>. Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination. This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange [3, 4, 22, 33, 35]. <p> Thus, this model opens up an entirely new framework together with its challenges for developing optimal algorithms to implement collective communication operations <ref> [23] </ref> in minimal time. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of the BRCP model by developing and evaluating algorithms for broadcast and multicast which are important collective communication operations. Application of this model to other collective communication operations like synchronization and global reduction can be found in [27, 28].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend in building future parallel systems due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead <ref> [12, 25] </ref>. Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category. Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. <p> The operational principle of a multidestination multicast worm is illustrated. 2.1 Wormhole k-ary n-cube Networks Multicomputers with direct networks supporting wormhole switching have become a popular trend in building large parallel systems. Most commonly used direct network topologies are meshes/tori belonging to the class of generalized k-ary n-cube interconnections <ref> [25] </ref>. These are n-dimensional grid structures with k 0 ; k 1 ; ; k n1 nodes along dimensions 0; 1; ; n 1, respectively. The values of k 0 ; k 1 ; ; k n1 may be equal or different. <p> The injection channels are used to inject messages to the network. Similarly, consumption channels are used to consume messages from the network. The injection and consumption channels are also known as internal channels in the literature <ref> [25] </ref>. consumption channels. 3 2.2 Multidestination Mechanism The concept of wormhole message passing mechanism with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni in [21]. The mechanism was used on wormhole networks with Hamiltonian-Path-based routing to support fast multicast/broadcast operations.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we only emphasize on broadcast and multicast operations. Recently we have also shown that the BRCP model is equally powerful to implement other collective communication operations like barrier synchronization <ref> [26] </ref> and global reduction [28] with reduced latency. Thus, the BRCP model promises significant potential to implement fast and efficient collective 2 communication operations in future wormhole systems with minimal increase in cost. The paper is organized as follows. <p> The multidestination mechanism is quite general and can be used with different functionality to implement different collective communication operations [29]. For example, a multi-destination multicast worm can be used to implement multicast/broadcast. A multidestination gather worm can be used for efficient barrier synchronization <ref> [26] </ref>. A multidestination exchange worm can be used for efficient global reduction [28]. In this paper, we illustrate the basic mul-tidestination mechanism with multicast functionality. <p> In this paper, we have studied the impact of the BRCP model to implement single-source broadcasting and multicasting. Applications of this model to other collective communication operations are presented in the following papers: barrier synchronization <ref> [26] </ref> and global reduction [28]. We are currently extending our work for multiple-multicast/broadcast complete-exchange, and parallel-prefix operations. Since multicast is a basic mechanism for implementing cache-coherency in distributed-shared-memory systems, we are also investigating the impact of this model to reduce cache-coherency overheads in these systems.
