Reference-contexts: 1.0 Introduction This report describes a component library and associated library management tools.This Library Management System (LMS) is being developed primarily to aid the component search, selection and procurement tasks during the physical design <ref> [1] </ref> of PCBs (printed circuit boards) and MCMs (multichip modules).

Reference-contexts: The need to build these complex relationships from the select and join primitives seriously degrade performance.Examples of this processing overhead have been observed in the current implementation of MICON, RACAL REDAC, Visuala <ref> [4] </ref> and the Eve DBMS for USCs Advanced Design AutoMation System [6]. The Eve database is built on top of a commercial relational DBMS. Although Eve successfully models the data representations for an object-based model, but the performance degradation manifests itself in slow response times.

Reference-contexts: These tools will reduce the designers dependence on the current paper-based manufacturers' data books and accelerate the trend towards electronic data books. These tools are being developed using the OCT database tools and the other tools developed as part of the ARPA-sponsored UCB SIERA design system and Lager IV <ref> [5] </ref>. A Component Library Management System 3 The proposed LMS is compatible with a broad range of commercial and university-developed tools and supports a neutral design style, that is, either text or graphical based system descriptions.
