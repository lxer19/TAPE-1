Title: Word processing with LyX High Level Word Processor based on TeX/LaTeX  
Note: (LyX 0.8, Documentation 0.7) Copyright (C) 1995 Matthias Ettrich  
Abstract: LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX that runs under X-Windows. It makes the power and typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to word processors. Since LyX supports the LaTeX-concept of general mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create beautiful documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also possible to use LaTeX-commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's power is lost.

Reference: <author> This Layout shouldn't be confused with LaTeX's "thebibliography", </author> <title> since it doesn't support citing at all. The bibliography in LyX is a very simple layout, where the first line starts at the beginning, but the following lines in one paragraph a little indented. There is also a heading generated. 10 This is how Bibliographies are usually typeset: References Tindal, Matthew, Christianity as old as creation, </title> <type> 1730. </type>
