Title: Quasi-Bayesian Strategies for Efficient Plan Generation: Application to the Planning to Observe Problem

Abstract: Quasi-Bayesian theory uses convex sets of probability distributions and expected loss to represent preferences about plans. The theory focuses on decision robustness, i.e., the extent to which plans are affected by deviations in subjective assessments of probability. Generating a plan means enumerating the actions to be taken and providing information about the robustness of the actions. The present work presents plan generation problems that can be solved faster in the Quasi-Bayesian framework than within usual Bayesian theory. We investigate this on the planning to observe problem, i.e., an agent must decide whether to take new observations or not. The fundamental question is: How, and how much, to search for a "best" plan, based on the precision of probability assessments? Plan generation algorithms are derived in the context of material classification with an acoustic robotic probe. A package that constructs Quasi-Bayesian plans is available through anonymous ftp.

Reference-contexts: Recently, great attention has been given to Robust Bayesian Statistics, which uses Quasi-Bayesian sets of distributions to represent imprecision of subjective probability assessments <ref> [ Berger, 1985; Walley, 1991 ] </ref> . A robust decision is one that can be safely taken despite the imprecision in the probability assessments; a non-robust decision is one that may produce wildly different results depending on the adopted distribution. <p> First, Quasi-Bayesian theory builds a realistic account of the imperfections in an agent's beliefs. It can be used to represent poor elicitation of preferences and situations of indifference among actions. Second, robustness studies can be formalized through this model <ref> [ Berger, 1985 ] </ref> . Third, the theory can represent the disparate opinions of a group of agents [ Levi, 1980 ] . 3 BUILDING A NEW APPROACH TO DECISION-MAKING A Bayesian agent can always say that a plan is better than, worse than, or equal to another plan. <p> Since there may be several E-admissible plans, Levi suggests secondary guidelines that enforce "security". Others have suggested the agent should minimize the maximum possible value of expected loss, an approach common in Robust Bayesian Statistics under the name of -minimax <ref> [ Berger, 1985 ] </ref> . We suggest that Quasi-Bayesian strategies should specify the admissible decisions and allow the agent to monitor the robustness of such decisions. These are the two requirements on a plan. <p> E-admissible plans for "pure" Gaussians in the credal set will be convenient since the prior and the likelihood are then conjugate <ref> [ Berger, 1985 ] </ref> . For each Gaussian distribution in the credal set N 0 , an E-admissible plan can be generated as follows: Take the semi-plane (t; ), &gt; 0 (inverse of variance fi mean).

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Agents choose a plan of action by comparing its possible outcomes against the outcomes of other plans. Bayesian theory suggests that the basis for such comparisons is expected loss with a single probability distribution. Quasi-Bayesian theory, as axiomatized by Giron and Rios <ref> [ Giron and Rios, 1980 ] </ref> , also relies on expected loss, but uses a convex set of probability distributions to represent the agent's beliefs. <p> Giron and Rios present a set of axioms that validate the preferences of a Quasi-Bayesian agent <ref> [ Giron and Rios, 1980 ] </ref> . The set of probability distributions K is called the credal set [ Levi, 1980 ] . <p> Call = j 2 1 j the width of the credal set. After each measurement we use Bayes rule to update each distribution in the credal set; after n measurements x i (with mean x), the posterior credal set is <ref> [ Giron and Rios, 1980 ] </ref> : N n = fConvex Combinations of N ; j ; (t + nr) 1 j 2 t 1 + nrx ; t + nr : (2) A fundamental property is that the width of the set shrinks to t =(t + nr) after n

Reference-contexts: The theory developed above admits a different, possibly fruitful, interpretation. Suppose an agent has a Quasi-Bayesian model and the agent is not interested in the robustness of actions; instead, the agent wishes to generate admissible actions as fast as possible. This interpretation of Quasi-Bayesian decision making (as advocated by <ref> [ Good, 1983 ] </ref> ) is that the agent has exhausted preferences and can pick admissible actions arbitrarily. We demonstrated that, for the planning to observe problem, the agent can generate E-admissible plans faster than a Quasi-Bayesian agent could generate a "best" plan.

Reference-contexts: Again, as the problem became more involved, the savings in the New Quasi-Bayesian scheme increased when compared to the Bayesian prescription. 4.5 EVALUATING THE SOLUTION IN A REAL PROBLEM Consider the construction of a robotic probe for classification of material based on acoustic signals <ref> [ Krotkov and Klatzky, 1995 ] </ref> . The taks is for a robot to decide whether a material belongs to one of two classes based on the tangent of the angle of internal friction, tan , which is captured from acoustic analysis of impact sounds. <p> We translate these values so that is zero when tan is -11; now we decide whether is larger or smaller than zero. Experiments suggest a Gaussian model for the measurements: X i ~ N (x i ; ; r), with r = 1 <ref> [ Krotkov and Klatzky, 1995 ] </ref> . Very sparse knowledge about must be translated into a belief model. Trying to model this with a single prior leads to a number of arbitrary choices.

Reference-contexts: We demonstrate how to monitor robustness and how to choose E-admissible actions. Our proposal can be extended to the class of planning to observe problems with multivariate data or with general distributions and conjugate priors (for example, beta priors with binomial observations <ref> [ Lindley and Barnett, 1965 ] </ref> ). Further research is needed to extend these ideas to other, more general decision problems.
