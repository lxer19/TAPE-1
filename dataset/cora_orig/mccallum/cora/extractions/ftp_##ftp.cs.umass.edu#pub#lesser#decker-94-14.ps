Abstract: UMass Computer Science Technical Report 94-14 August 9, 1995 Abstract Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedules tasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction. We analyze the performance of several GPGP algorithm family members and one centralized upper bound reference algorithm, using data from simulations of multiple agent teams working in abstract task environments. We show how to decide if adding a new mechanism is useful, and suggest a way to prune the search for an appropriate combination of mechanisms in an environment. 1 A shorter version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the First International Conference on

Reference-contexts: Besides the obvious connections to the earlier PGP work, GPGP builds on work by von Martial [20] in detecting and reacting to relationships (such as von Martial's favor relationship). GPGP also uses a notion of social commitments similar to those discussed by <ref> [2, 19, 1, 15] </ref>. Durfee's newer work [9] is based on a hierarchical behavior space representation that like GPGP allows agents to communicate at multiple levels of detail. <p> Commitments are socialdirected to particular agents in the sense of the work of Shoham and Castelfranchi <ref> [1, 19] </ref>). A local commitment C by agent A becomes a non-local commitment when received by another agent B.

This test is easy to compute and makes very few assumptionsprimarily that the variables are interval-valued and comparable within each block of paired responses.

Reference-contexts: The GPGP approach consists of an extendable set of modular coordination mechanisms, any subset or all of which can be used in response to a particular task environment. Each mechanism is defined using our formal framework for expressing coordination problems (TMS <ref> [8] </ref>). GPGP both generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm [10]. Our approach has several unique features: * Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current subjective task environment. <p> Each GPGP coordination mechanism is a response to some coordination relationship. The TMS framework (Task Analysis, Environment Modeling, and Simulation) <ref> [8] </ref> represents coordination problems in a formal, domain-independent way. We have used it to represent coordination problems in distributed sensor networks, hospital patient scheduling, airport resource management, distributed information retrieval, pilot's associate, local area network diagnosis, etc. [4]. <p> In this paper we will describe an agent's current subjective beliefs 1 These five mechanisms are oriented towards producing PGP-like `cooperative team' behavior. Mechanisms for self-interested agents are also possible. 2 about the structure of the problem it is trying to solve by using the TMS framework <ref> [8, 4] </ref>. For this purpose, there are two unique features of TMS. The first is the explicit, quantitative representation of task interrelationships as functions that describe the effect of activity choices and temporal orderings on performance. The second is the representation of task structures at multiple levels of abstraction. <p> In this paper the utility function is the sum of the task group qualities P T 2E Q (T ; D (T )), where Q (T; t) denotes the quality of T at time t as defined in <ref> [8] </ref>. Quality does not accrue after a task group's deadline. The second input is a set of commitments C. These commitments are produced by the GPGP coordination mechanisms, and act as extra constraints on the schedules that are produced by the local scheduler. <p> The positive relationship facilitates (M 1 ; M 2 ; d ; q ) indicates that executing M 1 before M 2 decreases the duration of M 2 by a `power' factor related to d and increases the maximum quality possible by a `power' factor related to q (see <ref> [8] </ref> for the details). A more situation-specific version of this coordination mechanism might ignore relationships with very low `power'.

Reference-contexts: More detailed information about this kind of interface between the local scheduler and the coordination component may be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. This is an extremely general definition of the local scheduler, and is the minimal one necessary for the GPGP coordination module. Stronger definitions than this will be needed for more predictable performance, as we will discuss later.

Reference-contexts: The experimental results reported here were achieved using a `design-to-time' real-time local scheduler developed by Garvey <ref> [13] </ref>. * GPGP, unlike PGP, is not tied to a single domain. GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity than PGP with respect to agent capabilities. GPGP mechanisms in general exchange less information than the PGP algorithm, and the information that GPGP mechanisms exchange can be at different levels of abstraction.
