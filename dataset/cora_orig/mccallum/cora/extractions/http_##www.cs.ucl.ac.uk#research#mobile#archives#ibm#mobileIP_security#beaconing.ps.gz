Abstract: We observe the following trends: a requirement of system support for user mobility; availability of wireless networking technologies that support hardware broadcast; untethered access becoming the norm rather than the exception. We revisit service protocol design from this perspective, and hypothesize that they should be constructed such that, whenever possible, the infrastructure initiates them and that the initial message of the protocol be piggybacked on the periodic beacons often already present in such systems. We illustrate that these policy decisions best match the underlying wireless networking hardware mechanisms, and that they are a better match than client initiation and client beaconing to the needs of cellular wireless systems. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis, and conclude with a description of experiments underway attempting to validate this claim.

Reference-contexts: In the wired domain, such information is generally static, and therefore a bootstrap can be obtained via initialization files (i.e. /etc/resolv.conf). 2.2.3 Revised wireless link encryption A protocol designed for use at the link layer by Diffie and Aziz <ref> [3] </ref> presents an interesting dilemma. The goal of the protocol is to reduce the number of computationally expensive RSA operations used in achieving a secure link-layer channel.

Reference-contexts: Many MAC protocols take advantage of this property, using such techniques as listening to the channel (CSMA) or for a busy/idle bit (ISMA/DSMA) before sending. Others restrict it by using schemes such as CDMA with receiver-directed codes. Support should become more common as standards such as IEEE 802.11 <ref> [5] </ref> are gradually accepted.

Reference-contexts: The hope is to allow users to roam in arbitrary environments with seamless connectivity, allowing their applications to maintain the semantics of a single session. Other goals include automatic adaptation to changes in connectivity [7] [12], session guarantees for weakly-consistent replicated data <ref> [6] </ref>, and maintenance of location-dependent data and functionality [16]. In the course of providing these services, new protocols will be developed; in order to develop them intelligently, the infrastructure assumptions need to be revisited. 1.1 Goals It is the purpose of this paper to comment on current mobility-oriented protocol design.

Reference-contexts: accurate is situations such as when the user is at home and thus had reliable information, or if a user is visiting somewhere with an itinerary. 2.2.4 Resource Discovery Two current resource discovery protocol proposals include the IETF Service Location Protocol (SLP) [20] and Charlie Perkins' Resource Discovery Protocol (RDP) <ref> [8] </ref>. They are destined to evolve together into the final IETF standard, and thus are still changing. The current SLP protocol bootstraps with multicast to a specific address, caching replies and using them for arbitrarily long periods of time without regard to physical locality (the BS to geography mapping).

Reference-contexts: Hints such what whether the local resources are over-subscribed, what the pricing model is, etc., can be embedded with low overhead. 2.2.5 Active Badges Another currently deployed system that includes beaconing is the Olivetti Active Badge system <ref> [9] </ref>. The Olivetti Active Badge system should be the canonical example of the mobile-initiated environment. There is negligible data traffic, and the only requirement is to track user location a one-way conversation (push) from client to server. Interestingly, though, even here it seems that back-of-the-envelope numbers point toward server initiation. <p> Empty cells cost no power and the gratuitous beacon can be ignored for all non-overlapping cells. As for actual data sequences begin sent between the infrastructure and a badge, the Active Badge communication sequence described in <ref> [9] </ref> requires four wireless and three wired hops to transmit a single command. With base station beaconing, this rather inefficient protocol can easily be reduced to two wireless and two wired hops.

Reference-contexts: never otherwise. 4 Related work One of the first descriptions of the utility of sending beacons from the base station (or in their case, a similar entity called the mobile support station) is included in a version of one of the original Columbia papers on IP routing to mobile clients <ref> [10] </ref>. Interestingly, the SIGCOMM version of the paper dropped these arguments, presumably because of space limitations.

Reference-contexts: They instead only note that there was a choice between broadcasting beacons or using client requests, and that the former 9 is "more appropriate because this way MHs already in the cell can tell that they are still within the realm of the MSS" <ref> [11] </ref>. The change is notable because the implications of this choice must have seemed either orthogonal to their goals or obvious.

Reference-contexts: A lack of clock synchronization can cause problems, especially for protocols that depend it, such as the popular Kerberos authentication protocol. The use of such protocols as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) <ref> [13] </ref> have been used to alleviate this problem. We now show how NTP is amenable to being piggybacked on the system beacons, in this case saving bandwidth. The Network Time Protocol has three modes of operation: procedure-call, symmetric, and multicast.

Reference-contexts: Advertising the cell's average available bandwidth, expected jitter, worst-case latency, handoff processing delays, etc., should assist the mobile in choosing whether to handoff and optimize the process itself. One handoff-enabled IP routing protocol, the Mobile-IP proposal <ref> [14] </ref>, is rapidly moving toward being established as the de jour IP routing standard. It allows for a variety of operational semantics, including operation with or without a local foreign agent. If a foreign agent is available, the agent periodically sends modified ICMP router advertisement messages as cell beacons.

Reference-contexts: The original and revised sequences are shown in figure 1. . is a client-initiated BS to MH send, the revised is a server-initiated BS to MH send. 2.2.6 PARCTAB Another example deployed wireless system that includes beaconing is the PARCTAB system <ref> [15] </ref>. Like the Active Badge system, the designers chose to have the mobiles beacon rather than the base stations. The designers support this decision by claiming that waking up and transmitting requires little more power than waking up and receiving.

Reference-contexts: First of all, the optimization of location tracking in section 2.2.5 (above) will hold true. As a more involved example, in <ref> [17] </ref>, clients subscribe to dynamic environments updated via either client requests or callbacks. Therein, they note that because of the use of a RPC from the environment server to each client, the product of the update rate and number of subscribers is limited.

Reference-contexts: In either case, the initiation messages could be piggybacked on the system beacons. We describe situations where this can either increase utilization, decrease latency, or both. 2.2.2 Routing, handoff, and Mobile-IP One of the original motivations for beaconing is to support base station handoffs due to mobility <ref> [18] </ref>. Often a handoff incurs data losses due to the new routing path and lack of exact synchronization at the participating base stations. Reducing the latency of this operation helps minimize the disruptions due to such losses.

Reference-contexts: This may be true in the picocellular IR environment in which they were experimenting, but it does not always remains so for other wireless technologies, such as microcellular RF <ref> [19] </ref>. Regardless of the power control issue, the PARCTAB system exhibits much more functionality than the active badge system, and therefore is a catalyst for discussion of the trade-offs inherent in mobile initiation versus base station initiation.

Reference-contexts: Such prefetching may be quite accurate is situations such as when the user is at home and thus had reliable information, or if a user is visiting somewhere with an itinerary. 2.2.4 Resource Discovery Two current resource discovery protocol proposals include the IETF Service Location Protocol (SLP) <ref> [20] </ref> and Charlie Perkins' Resource Discovery Protocol (RDP) [8].

Reference-contexts: It does so by separating the e-mail notification and receipt events, acting like the biff (1) program on UNIX systems. This avoids the polling traffic and overhead usually associated with monitoring a mail spool as a full-fledged mail handling application does. In <ref> [21] </ref>, the PARCTAB system's response time (latency) is described as adequate, but the bandwidth limitation was a problem in crowded meeting rooms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A current issue in computer science is the current trend toward allowing user and terminal mobility.

Reference-contexts: One general reason to use base station-initiated protocols with base station beaconing is the natural many-to-one mapping of mobile hosts to base station cells. In the future, packet-switched data communication will probably remain bursty in nature <ref> [24] </ref>. This remains true even for continuous stream services, such as voice and video, since they are often are encoded in variable bit-rate formats.
