Reference-contexts: This is true of earlier work on influence diagrams that introduces multiple (additive or multiplicative) value nodes [6], and more recent papers by Bacchus and Grove <ref> [1] </ref> and by Doyle and Wellman [2]. I think that there are two reasons why researchers have concentrated on the classical notions of conditional utility and utility independence. First, the decision theoretic literature itself (most notably, Keeney and Raiffa's [4]) presents compelling arguments in favor of these notions. <p> Perhaps for this reason, and despite great ingenuity on the part of the various authors, this notion has not yielded a computational device similar in nature and power to Bayesian networks. 1 1 Bacchus and Grove <ref> [1] </ref> do propose a graphical model in which to represent conditional independence, motivated by the analogy with Bayesian networks. However, their graphical model is very different from Bayesian networks (for example, arcs in it are undirected), and has not to date suggested a computational method. <p> The first definition is standard: Definition 8 A distribution is a pair (S; F ) such that S is a finite set (whose members are called components), and F is a function F : S ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that s2S F (s) = 1. F is lifted to 2 S (the set of all subsets of S) by F (x) = s2x F (s). <p> Fact 2 Given a probability distribution (S p ; P ) and a utility function U 0 : S p ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, there exists a bi-distribution ((S p ; P ); (S u ; U ); L) such for any s 2 S p it is the case that U 0 (s) = (s;t)2L U (t) and therefore also for any set x S P it is the case that s2x

The decision theory literature reinforces the analogy between the probabilistic and utilitarian notions. Here's a quote from <ref> [4] </ref>: One of the fundamental concepts of multiattribute utility theory is that of utility independence. Its role in multiattribute utility 3 theory is similar to that of probabilistic independence in multi-variate probability theory. (p.224) I argue that this analogy is misleading. <p> In multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) <ref> [3, 4] </ref> one posits a set of n attributes with corresponding domains D 1 ; D 2 ; : : : ; D n , and the set of states is defined to be the Cartesian product D 1 fi D 2 fi : : : fi D n . <p> In the following definition, Y and Z are sets of attributes (in most applications, Z will be the complement of Y ): Definition 1 (based on <ref> [4] </ref>, p.226) Y is utility independent of Z when conditional preferences on lotteries on Y given Z = z do not depend on the particular value of z. Using the notion of utility independence we define two independence conditions on a set of attributes. <p> The first definition doesn't appear in the literature as a definition or given this name, but these will be convenient: 2 All the material in this section is elementary textbook material. 5 Definition 2 (based on <ref> [4] </ref>, p.293) Attributes X 1 ; : : : ; X n are singulary utility independent if every X i is utility independent of X i . The next definition involves stronger independence conditions: Definition 3 ([4], p.289) Attributes X 1 ; : : : ; X n are mutually utility <p> Given this, let us define the additive form of MAU functions precisely: Definition 5 (adapted from <ref> [4] </ref>, p.295) A MAU function u over variables x 1 ; : : : ; x n is additive iff there exist functions u 1 ; : : : ; u n and constants k 1 ; : : : ; k n such that u (x 1 ; : :

Reference-contexts: Although this lies beyond the scope of this paper, let me add a few words on reasoning simultaneously about probabilities and utilities, in a structure we might call a bi-network. I've mentioned already that in <ref> [7] </ref> I define a bi-distribution, which couples a probability distribution (or p-distribution) with a utility distribution (or u-distribution). We can represent a bi-distribution by a pair of networks, a Bayesian network (or p-net) and a utility network (or u-net).
