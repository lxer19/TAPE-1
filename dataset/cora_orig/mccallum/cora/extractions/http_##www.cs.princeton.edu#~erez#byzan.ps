Abstract: All known fast randomized Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocols have (rare) infinite runs. We present a method of combining randomized BA protocols of a certain class with any deterministic BA protocol to obtain a randomized protocol which preserves the expected average complexity of the randomized protocol while guaranteeing termination in all runs. In particular, we obtain a randomized BA protocol with constant expected time which always terminate within t + O(log t) rounds, where t = O(n) is the number of faulty processors.

Reference-contexts: In other words, our randomized 1 Interestingly, Randomized protocols offer no advantage in case one requires concurrent termination [DM,MT]. 2 Also in the weaker model of fail-stop failures, fast randomized agreement protocols (e.g. <ref> [CMS] </ref>) have (rare) infinite runs. BA protocol is almost optimal 3 on the average and on the worst case simultaneously. It should be stressed that naive attempts to solve the problem fail.

Reference-contexts: Fischer and Lynch [FL] proved that t + 1 rounds are optimal (i.e. every deterministic BA protocol has a run which take at least t + 1 rounds). Improvement is possible through randomization. 1 In particular, Feldman and Micali <ref> [FM] </ref>, improving over previous works of Ben-Or [Be], Rabin [R], Chor and Coan [CC], and Bracha [Br], presented a randomized BA protocol with a constant expected time for t = O (n). <p> In (good) deterministic protocols the worst (and average) running times are equal to t + 1. In currently known randomized protocols the average time is less then t + 1 (in particular <ref> [FM] </ref> has an O (1) expected running time) and the worst case running time is unbounded. 3 The Protocol: All the known randomized protocols share a structure based on the notion of phases (consisting of a fixed number of rounds), and the notion of current value (which is the "favorite value" <p> Most of these protocols (in particular the <ref> [FM] </ref> protocol) meet the following properties: 3 Optimality on the average means up to an additive constant, while in the worst case optimality means up to an additive logarithmic factor. 4 Some of the protocols ignore this question completely, thus, implicitly identifying decision with termination. P1. <p> k k r However in all known randomized protocols a much stronger statement holds; namely, for some constant c 1, P k c k In particular, let us use a standard deterministic protocol (such as in [MW]) with T D = t + 1, and the randomized protocol suggested in <ref> [FM] </ref> with r = 15; T R = 56 and P k 0:27 k1 .

Reference-contexts: Finally, choosing k = O (log t) gives a constant expected time and worst case time of t + O (log t). 6 The Asynchronous Case Fischer, Lynch and Peterson <ref> [FLP] </ref> proved that no deterministic solution exists for the asynchronous BA problem even with one faulty processor. It follows that there is no randomized asynchronous protocol that terminates for all coin-tosses, all inputs, and all adversary behavior. <p> It follows that there is no randomized asynchronous protocol that terminates for all coin-tosses, all inputs, and all adversary behavior. Otherwise choose in advance a sequence of coin-tosses, say all zeros, and get a deterministic protocol that always terminates contradicting <ref> [FLP] </ref>. Therefore, in the asynchronous case it is not possible to "benefit from both worlds". 7 Conclusions and Open Problems In light of the result presented here, even the greatest opposers of randomization must agree to use it for Byzantine Agreement. There is almost nothing to loose.

Reference-contexts: Validity: If all good processors start with the same input value, they should all output this value, no matter what the faulty processors do. BA was introduced in the seminal paper of Pease, Shostak, and Lamport <ref> [PSL] </ref>. It has since been recognized as a key problem in the area and attracted much research. The status of BA, as well as other distributed tasks, heavily depends on the underlying communication model. <p> In this note we assume that communication takes place in synchronous rounds and via private channels connecting each pair of processors. (Brief remarks on the asynchronous model can be found in section 6). Let n be the number of processors and t be the number of faulty processors, <ref> [PSL] </ref> showed that no solution exists if n 3t. They also gave a deterministic algorithm solving the problem for the case n 3t. Their protocol consisted of t + 1 rounds but required exponential amount of communication.
