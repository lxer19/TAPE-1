Title: EUROPEAN LABORATORY FOR PARTICLE PHYSICS A Study of B Meson Oscillations Using Hadronic Z 0
Date: 2 April 1997  
Pubnum: CERN-PPE/97-036  
Abstract: An event sample enriched in semileptonic decays of b hadrons is selected using an inclusive lepton selection from approximately 3.0 million hadronic Z 0 decays collected with the OPAL detector. This sample is used to investigate B meson oscillations by reconstructing a proper decay time for the parent of each lepton, using a jet charge method to estimate the production flavour of this parent, and using the lepton charge to tag the decay flavour. We measure the mass difference between the two B 0 d mass eigenstates m d = 0:444 0:029 +0:020 For the B 0 s system, we find m s &gt; 3:1 ps 1 at the 95% confidence level. This limit varies only a little if alternative limit setting approaches are adopted. Regions at higher m s values are also excluded with some methods for setting the limit. By studying the charge symmetry of the B 0 d mixing structure, we are able to constrain possible CP and CPT violating effects. We measure the CP violation parameter Re * B = 0:006 0:010 0:006 and the indirect CPT violating parameter Im ffi B = 0:020 0:016 0:006 : If we invoke CPT symmetry, then we obtain Re * B = 0:002 0:007 0:003 : (Submitted to Zeitschrift fur Physik C)

Reference-contexts: The fitted value of f s , of particular relevance for m s measurements, was (11:5 1:9)%. A second technique for studying m s , known as the amplitude method <ref> [28] </ref>, was also used. The method consists of replacing the cos m s t 0 term in the physics function with A cos m s t 0 , where A is known as the amplitude.

Reference-contexts: The central values quoted above were corrected for this effect. Finally, a cos asymmetry for lepton identification in the detector would cause a charge asymmetry through the Z ! bb forward-backward asymmetry, measured by OPAL to be (9:06 0:51 0:23)% at the Z 0 peak <ref> [30] </ref>. CP (T) violation would not induce a cos asymmetry. A lepton cos asymmetry of (1:7 0:3)% (more leptons at cos &lt; 0) was observed in the data.

Reference-contexts: An estimate of the decay proper time of the inferred b hadron was reconstructed for each lepton candidate, and a jet charge technique was used to tag the produced B flavour. We measure m d = 0:444 0:029 +0:020 This result is consistent with previous measurements <ref> [24, 25, 31] </ref>, and represents the most precise result for a single technique. Taking account of the common systematic errors, we combine this measurement with previous OPAL results [24, 25] to give m d = 0:475 +0:022 +0:018 The small statistical correlations between the results have a negligible effect.
