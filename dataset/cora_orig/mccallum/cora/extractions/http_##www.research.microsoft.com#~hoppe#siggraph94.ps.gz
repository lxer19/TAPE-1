Abstract: We present a general method for automatic reconstruction of accurate, concise, piecewise smooth surface models from scattered range data. The method can be used in a variety of applications such as reverse engineering the automatic generation of CAD models from physical objects. Novel aspects of the method are its ability to model surfaces of arbitrary topological type and to recover sharp features such as creases and corners. The method has proven to be effective, as demonstrated by a number of examples using both simulated and real data. A key ingredient in the method, and a principal contribution of this paper, is the introduction of a new class of piecewise smooth surface representations based on subdivision. These surfaces have a number of properties that make them ideal for use in surface reconstruction: they are simple to implement, they can model sharp features concisely, and they can be fit to scattered range data using an unconstrained optimization procedure.

Reference-contexts: The most popular smooth surface representations are tensor product NURBS. However, NURBS can only represent surfaces of arbitrary topological type by partitioning the model into a collection of individual NURBS patches. Adjacent patches must then be explicitly stitched together using geometric continuity conditions <ref> [6] </ref>. A large number of parameters (the B-spline coefficients) are therefore introduced, most of which are constrained by the continuity conditions. As a consequence, fitting NURBS in general requires high-dimensional constrained optimization.

Reference-contexts: Equation 2 suggests that the limit point can be obtained by analyzing the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrix. Indeed, the limit point can be expressed as an affine combination of the initial vertex positions <ref> [8] </ref>: v = 0 0 0 ` 1 + ` 2 + ` n+1 where (` 1 ; :::; ` n+1 ) is the dominant left eigenvector of S n . For Loop's surfaces this affine combination can be expressed as the position mask shown in Figure 2 [13]. <p> Eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix can also be used to establish smoothness. It can be shown, for instance, that Loop's surfaces are indeed tangent plane continuous [13, 19]. Moreover, Halstead et al. <ref> [8] </ref> show that the tangent vectors to the limit surface at v 1 can be computed using the two left eigenvectors of S n corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue (this eigenvalue has multiplicity 2).

We define a set of four elementary mesh transformations, edge collapse, edge swap, edge split, and edge tag, taking a tagged sim-plicial complex (K; L) to another tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ), as shown in Figure 5. The first three transformations are discussed in [11]. <p> of <ref> [11] </ref>. We define a set of four elementary mesh transformations, edge collapse, edge swap, edge split, and edge tag, taking a tagged sim-plicial complex (K; L) to another tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ), as shown in Figure 5. The first three transformations are discussed in [11]. The fourth transformation, edge tag, is a toggle that either adds an edge to the set L of sharp edges, or removes one from it. <p> A legal move is the application of one of these elementary transformations to an edge of K that leaves the topological type of K unchanged. The criterion for determining whether a move is legal is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Our goal is to find a sequence of legal moves taking us from an initial tagged simplicial complex (K 0 ; L 0 ) to one for which a minimum of E is achieved.
