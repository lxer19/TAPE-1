Reference-contexts: Then every event which takes place along the line 1 also takes place at a particular point 1 of the train 1 . Also, the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train 1 in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment 1 . <ref> (Einstein, 1939) </ref> Three lexical chains can be identified: 1. ftrain, rails, train, train, train, line, point, train, train, embankmentg 2. ftraveling, velocity, direction, travelingg 3. freference-body, referenceg The context created by the first chain enables the identification of the appropriate meaning of the word line.

Reference-contexts: He noticed that most of these real-word errors belonged to the first category. Atwell and Elliot (1987) with the University of Lancaster Unit for Computer Research on the English Language (UCREL) <ref> (Garside, Leech and Sampson, 1987) </ref> analyzed three different kinds of text that had not previously been automatically proofread: published texts, 11- and 12-year-old students' essays, and text written by non-native English speakers. They found that the corresponding amount of real-word errors were 48%, 64%, and 96% respectively.
