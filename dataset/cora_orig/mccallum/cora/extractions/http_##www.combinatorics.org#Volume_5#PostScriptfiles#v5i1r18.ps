Abstract: We present a unified theory for permutation models of all the infinite families of finite and affine Weyl groups, including interpretations of the length function and the weak order. We also give new combinatorial proofs of Bott's formula (in the refined version of Macdonald) for the Poincare series of these affine Weyl groups.

Reference-contexts: Our starting point is the symmetric group S n , the group of permutations of <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref>. If S n is presented as the group generated by adjacent transpositions, it is isomorphic to the Weyl group A n1 , and we obtain well-known interpretations of several Coxeter group concepts in permutation language: 1. The Coxeter generators are the adjacent transpositions. 2. <p> In particular, <ref> [: : : ; 1; 0; 1; 2; : : :] </ref> 7! [: : : ; 1 ; 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : :] and we shall identify the operator with this -vector. <p> We define the product of two Z-permutations as the composite operator "first , then ". From <ref> [: : : ; 1; 0; 1; 2; : : :] </ref> 7! [: : : ; 1 ; 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : :] 7! [: : : ; 1 ; 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : :] we see that () i = i . <p> In the last fifteen years, representations of the affine groups e A n , e B n , e C n and e D n by infinite periodic permutations have been presented. Lusztig [14] and Bedard <ref> [1] </ref> seem to be the first references for the permutation representations of e A n and e C n respectively (although none of them explicitly proves that these representations are faithful). These representations of e A n and e C n are used also by Shi [18]. <p> In C 4 , this permutes the interval [4; : : : ; 4] as follows: <ref> [4; 3; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; 3; 4] </ref> !

Thus every pair in the class inversion h ( i ; j )i is an inversion. Example Consider the permutation = <ref> [2; 1; 3; 0; 3; 1; 2] </ref> in the George group C 3 . -s s s s sss 3 2 1 1 2 3 There are seven inversions in : (2; 3), (1; 3), (1; 0), (1; 1), (0; 1), (3; 1) and (3; 2). <p> Define I () as the set of class inversions in a permutation 2 G. Define the class inversion number by inv () = jI ()j, the number of class inversions in . Our first aim is to show that inv () is always finite. Recall that the the interval <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> contains one representative of each class of values. <p> Define the inversion table of by the numbers inv ij () = jI L ij ()j jI R Example As an example of these definitions, consider as in our previous example the George group C 3 and the permutation = <ref> [2; 1; 3; 0; 3; 1; 2] </ref>. In this group there is no periodicity, so the only periodic image of i is i itself, and the only mirror image of i is i. <p> For every George group we shall give a characterization of the fundamental n-tuple and compute explicit expressions for the inversion table, from which the length formula and the weak order criterion follows. 8.1 Compatible groups 8.1.1 George group S n The fundamental n-tuple is any permutation of <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref>. The inversion table has inv ij = 1 if i &lt; j and 1 j , zero otherwise. All other entries are zero. <p> group C n An n-tuple [ 1 ; : : : ; n ] is the fundamental n-tuple of a 2 e C n if and only if it is a signed permutation, that is, if [j 1 j; : : : ; j n j] is a permutation of <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref>. The action of s i on the fundamental n-tuple is s i = (i i+1) for i = 1; : : : ; n 1, while s 0 changes the sign of the value at position 1. <p> B n and e D n ) are all constructed basically in the same way, with slight modifications according to the different types of mirrors. 9.4 Proof of Bott's formula for e A n The parabolic subgroup A n of e A n permutes the numbers within the position segment <ref> [1; n+1] </ref> (and (n+1)-periodically). Thus, the minimal coset representatives of e A n =A n are the permutations in e A n that are increasing in the position segment [1; n + 1]. <p> Thus, the minimal coset representatives of e A n =A n are the permutations in e A n that are increasing in the position segment <ref> [1; n + 1] </ref>. Any such permutation that is not the identity must have a descent between positions n + 1 and n + 2, so the class adjacent transposition s n+1 , that switches positions (n + 1; n + 2) (and periodically) is length decreasing. <p> We give an example for e A 3 showing the segment [i; 3+i] in each step and recording the sequence of length decreases. By periodicity, the number to be moved into the segment is 4 plus the number at position i. <ref> [5; 1; 6; 8] </ref> ! [1; 1; 6; 8] ! [1; 3; 6; 8] ! [3; 5; 6; 8] !

Reference-contexts: The finite case is easy, and Eq. 1 has a straightforward combinatorial proof for each group. The affine case has been considered much harder. We will refer to Eq. (2) as Bott's formula. It was proved by Bott <ref> [5] </ref> in 1956, as an application of Morse theory to the topology of Lie groups. Although there are several later proofs (see references in [13]), none of them catches the simple combinatorial flavor of the finite case. <p> We give an example for e A 3 showing the segment [i; 3+i] in each step and recording the sequence of length decreases.
