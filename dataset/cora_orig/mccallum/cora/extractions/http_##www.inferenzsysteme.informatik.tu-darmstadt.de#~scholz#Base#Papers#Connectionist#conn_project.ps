Reference-contexts: Each digit is represented by a grid of 16x16 pixels. The output of the network should be a local representation of the digits. 2 Description The network was built with the pdp software which is part of <ref> [1] </ref>. It consists out of three layers. The input layer has 256 units, the hidden layer 25 and the output layer 10 ones. Each intput unit corresponds to one pixel. These units are grouped to 25 squares with size 4x4. The hidden units are fully connected to the output units.
