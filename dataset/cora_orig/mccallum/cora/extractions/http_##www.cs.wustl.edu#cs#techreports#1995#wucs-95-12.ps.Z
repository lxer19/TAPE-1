Abstract: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network technology is expected to become a central part of the emerging global information infrastructure. ATM networks introduce a number of features that distinguish them from earlier technologies and introduce new issues in network control. This paper offers a framework for precisely defining and analyzing alternative approaches to the distributed control of ATM networks and explores some of the key design issues through a series of examples. It is hoped that it will provide a useful foundation for researchers in networking and distributed computing interested in exploring these issues further and developing more complete solutions.

Reference-contexts: It is directed to researchers in both distributed systems and networking, since the creation of effective solutions for these problems requires the methods and perspectives of both research communities. ATM technology has its roots in research projects in CNET <ref> [4, 5] </ref> and Bell Labs`[14, 16] in the early eighties. After more than a decade of research and development, it has emerged as a central technology component for the emerging information superhighway.

Reference-contexts: Yet another way to manage the distributed control in large networks is to organize the control in a hierarchical fashion. This is of course the classical approach used in telephone networks and has also been suggested in recent proposals for ATM network control <ref> [9, 21] </ref>. This paper does not consider the full range of operations that might be performed on 22 Issues in Distributed Control for ATM Networks a connection.

Reference-contexts: ATM networks introduce some new issues for network design that have not been widely studied and are directly relevant to the question of routing in ATM networks. While such questions are beyond the scope of this paper, the interested reader will find a good introduction to these issues in <ref> [10] </ref>. There are other approaches for how to distribute control in a network that we haven't touched on. In general, all the control algorithms we have considered rely on structural partitioning to define regions of the network controlled by different entities (in some cases these regions are single switches).

Reference-contexts: Multicast routing is another issue that was touched on only lightly in the body of the paper. This is a major subject in its own right and has been discussed in a number of papers <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. <p> This is the general type of algorithm considered here, although others are certainly possible within the context of the same general framework for distributed control. While the worst-case performance of these algorithms can be poor, simulations provide evidence that they should work well in practice <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. It's important to note that routing and network topology design are very inter-related. While it can be useful to consider them separately, one cannot really understand how routing algorithms are likely to perform without also understanding something about how networks are configured.

Reference-contexts: Discussion of alternative design approaches and useful surveys are rare <ref> [20] </ref>. This paper is an attempt to formulate the network control problem for ATM and similar networks, in a way that clarifies the key issues and provides a framework for carefully addressing issues of correctness, computational efficiency and resource allocation.
