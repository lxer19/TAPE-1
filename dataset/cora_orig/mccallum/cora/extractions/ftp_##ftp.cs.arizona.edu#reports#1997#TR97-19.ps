Reference-contexts: In reality, the buffer is size bytes long. (This is the size field in the MsgNodeLeafPart structure). This works correctly so long as this structure appears at the very end of the enclosing data structure. The declaration is given below. struct MsgNodePagePart - char buffer <ref> [1] </ref>; /* longer in actuality */ -; BUF type nodes contain a reference to the function that is used to free (deallocate) the data buffer once it is no longer needed by the message library.
