Abstract: This paper proposes a simple method for estimating the position of a robot from relatively few sensor readings. Our algorithms are intended for applications where sensor readings are expensive or otherwise limited and the readings that are taken are subject to considerable errors or noise. Our method is capable of converging to a position estimate with greater accuracy using fewer measurements than other methods often used for this type of application, such as the Kalman and extended Kalman filters. Our approach is validated using a mobile robot on which a camera is used to obtain bearing information with respect to landmarks in the environment.

Reference-contexts: When Does Total Least Squares Admit Unique Solution? Regarding existence and uniqueness of a solution to (9), the theory of TLS <ref> (Bjorck 1996, p178) </ref> provides us with this theorem THEOREM T4. <p> This sufficient to guarantee a unique solution to the TLS problem <ref> (Bjorck 1996, p179) </ref>. 2 - 13 - To interpret this result, if the matrix A of coefficients is well conditioned enough (i.e. oe min (A) is large enough) and the least squares residual (from (8)) is small enough (i.e. the effective noise introduced into the right hand side vector b is <p> The two most popular methods are based on, respectively, the Normal Equations and the QR Decomposition. We very briefly sketch the methods in their traditional form, and then later indicate how these methods may be adapted to recursive computation. Details can be found in <ref> (Bjorck 1996) </ref>. The Normal Equations arising from (8) is the p fi p matrix equation A T Ax = A T b: (12) The solution of this system of equations yields the least squares solution to (8), assuming A has full column rank. <p> The QR Decomposition of A is the factorization QR = A where Q is an n fi p matrix with orthonormal columns and R is a p fi p upper triangular matrix. This can be computed by standard algorithms <ref> (Bjorck 1996, sec. 2.3-2.4) </ref>. Once computed, the least squares solution can be obtained by solving the square, triangular system Rx = Q T b: (13) This method has the advantage that R has the same conditioning as A, but it is slightly more expensive if A has many rows. 4.1. <p> Likewise, the new right hand side consists of just the old right hand side plus a simple correction: ( A T a ) b ! Since the Normal Equations are a symmetric positive definite system, they are solved via the Cholesky factorization <ref> (Bjorck 1996, sec. 2.2.2) </ref>, A = LL T , which is essentially a symmetric version of Gaussian Elimination when pivoting is necessary, where L is lower triangular. <p> Instead of updating the matrix A T A, we would really like to update its Cholesky factor, and the cost of this is p 2 floating point operations (multiplies and adds). We refer the reader to <ref> (Bjorck 1996, sec. 3.2) </ref> for the details. Updating the right hand side costs 2p operations. Solving the new Normal Equations, given the new Cholesky factorization, requires two triangular solves costing a - 15 - total of 2p 2 operations. <p> R = R ! The e Q b R factorization of (17) can be computed fast (4p 3 =3), independent of the number of samples taken), and in fact one can speed it up to 2p 2 operations by taking advantage of the fact that R is already upper triangular <ref> (Bjorck 1996, p136) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The respective costs are given in Table 3. We can adapt the ULV Decomposition to solve the Total Least Squares (TLS) problem Ax b, where new measurements b are continually being added, as proposed in <ref> (Boley, Steinmetz, & Sutherland 1995) </ref>. The adaptation of the ULV to the TLS problem has also been analyzed independently in great detail in (Van Huffel & Zha 1993), though the recursive updating process was not discussed at length.

Reference-contexts: When error exists in both the measurement and the data matrix, the best solution in the least squares sense is often not as good as the best solution in the eigenvector sense, where the sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances from the points to the lines are minimized <ref> (Duda & Hart 1973) </ref> (Fig. 1).

Reference-contexts: The experiment was carried out with the same hardware as in the first experiment. In this case, the image processing was carried out an a 486-based PC-104 system. By using a more efficient image processing algorithm <ref> (Fischer & Gini 1996) </ref>, we were able to use landmarks consisting of a large letter T on a white 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper, under ordinary room light conditions.

Reference-contexts: The Kalman filter equations and a schematic diagram of the filter are in the Appendix. A complete description of the filter can be found in <ref> (Gelb 1974) </ref>. It requires an initial estimate of the solution and assumes that noise is weighted white gaussian. The discrete Kalman filter is guaranteed to be optimal in that it is guaranteed to find the best solution in the least squares sense. <p> Also, due to the fact that functions are frequently non-linear, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used (Ayache & Faugeras 1989; Kosaka & Kak 1992). The EKF formalism linearizes the function - 3 - by taking a first order Taylor expansion around the current estimate of the state vector <ref> (Gelb 1974) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy can be degraded if this assumption is violated by, for example, the presence of systematic errors. - 4 - * An underlying assumption in least squares estimation is that the entries in the data matrix are error-free <ref> (Golub & Van Loan 1989) </ref>. In many actual applications, the errors in the data matrix can be at least as great as the measurement errors. In such cases, a Total Least Squares (TLS) approach can give better results. <p> But in the presence of errors in the coefficients, the equations will not be satisfied exactly. The following is well known from the theory of linear least squares <ref> (Golub & Van Loan 1989, p222) </ref>: THEOREM T1. The least squares problem min krk = min kAx bk 2 (8) admits a unique solution if and only if A has full column rank. <p> Thus there are two sources of perturbations to the "exact" set of equations to be solved: sensor errors and round-off errors. Both types of perturbations are subject to amplification due to the conditioning of the system of matrix equations, as shown by the following result <ref> (Golub & Van Loan 1989, p228) </ref>: THEOREM T3.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5 we illustrate the behavior of the method with some experiments, and we end in Section 6 with some concluding remarks. 1.2. The Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter The discrete Kalman filter <ref> (Kalman 1960) </ref>, commonly used for prediction and detection of signals in communication and control problems, has more recently become a popular method of reducing uncertainty in robot navigation. <p> Limitations of the Kalman Filter There are several basic problems which can occur when using either the Kalman or extended Kalman filter in robot navigation applications: * The filter was developed for applications such as those in signal processing in which many measurements are taken <ref> (Kalman 1960) </ref>. Sensing in robot navigation is often done using camera images. The gathering and processing of each image is a time consuming process so a successful method must make do with relatively few readings. * The Kalman filter assumes a starting estimate is available.

Reference-contexts: We seek a method that can obtain a good approximation to the TLS solution, but which admits rapid updating as new data samples arrive. One such method is the so-called ULV Decomposition, first introduced by Stewart <ref> (Stewart 1993) </ref> as a means to obtain an approximate SVD which can be easily updated as new data arrives, without making any a priori assumptions about the overall distribution of the singular values.

Reference-contexts: Two Landmark Simulation. The second set of experiments was run in simulation, but used two landmarks. We assumed that the robot has no instrument such as a compass which could be used to register its heading. Such instruments can give varying, incorrect readings in outdoor, unstructured environments <ref> (Sutherland & Thompson 1994) </ref>, so it is useful to design and evaluate methods to obtain heading information from external sources. If such heading information was available, it could be used independently or as a correction to estimates from internal sources.
