Abstract: This paper discusses a statistical model for recognizing discourse intentions of utterances during dialogue interactions. We argue that this recognition process should be based on features of the current utterance as well as on discourse history, and show that taking into account utterance features such as speaker information and syntactic forms of utterances dramatically improves the system's performance as compared with a simple trigram model of discourse acts. In addition, we propose that taking into account information about discourse structure may allow the system to construct a more accurate discourse act model and thus improve recognition results. Experiments show this proposal to be promising.

Reference-contexts: Core (1998), on the other hand, use previous utterance tags and existing tags for the current utterance to predict possible additional tags for the current utterance using the DAMSL annotation scheme <ref> (Core & Allen 1997) </ref>. The second problem is dialogue act recognition, where the dialogue system determines the dialogue act that best fits the intention of an utterance given the utterance and previous discourse (Mast et al. 1995; Reithinger & Klesen 1997; Samuel, Carberry, & Vijay-Shanker 1998; Stolcke et al. 1998).

Reference-contexts: Discourse Structure Previous work on constructing n-gram models of discourse acts all treated dialogues as linear sequences of actions when in fact we know that discourse is highly structured (see, for example <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We selected 6 out of the 8 dialogues, consisting of 671 utterances, as our training data. Because of the limited size of our training set, it is necessary to obtain smoothed trigram probabilities by interpolating trigram, bigram, and unigram frequencies as follows <ref> (Jelinek 1990) </ref>: P (d 3 jd 1 ; d 2 ) = 3 f (d 3 jd 1 ; d 2 ) + 2 f (d 3 jd 2 ) + 1 f (d 3 ) In the above equation, 1 , 2 , and 3 must be non-negative and must <p> Our training process iterates through the training data in order to select these coefficients to satisfy the maximum-likelihood criterion <ref> (Jelinek 1990) </ref>. To examine the effect of discourse structure information on discourse act recognition, we constructed two trigram models of discourse acts. The first model does not take into account information about discourse structure, and thus treats dialogues as linear sequences of utterances.

Reference-contexts: When taken into account during the training process, the discourse structure will help 2 We are interested in the discourse structure that represents how the participants' intentions relate to one another, as in the intention level discussed in <ref> (Moore & Pollack 1992) </ref>. the system relate utterances that are close in terms of discourse content, instead of those that are merely uttered in sequence, allowing the system to construct a more accurate n-gram model of discourse acts.

Reference-contexts: A Statistical Model for Discourse Act Recognition Formalism The goal in discourse act recognition is to determine, given a set of utterances u 1;n , the sequence of discourse acts d 1;n that best describes their intentions. For this task, we utilize a hidden Markov model as described in <ref> (Rabiner 1990) </ref>. Using this formalism, we want to find arg max d 1;n P (d 1;n ju 1;n ), i.e., the most probable d 1;n given u 1;n .

Reference-contexts: Mast et al. (1995) determined the dialogue act of an utterance based on the word sequence that comprises the utterance alone, without any additional discourse information. Reithinger and Klesen's model performs dialogue act classification based on the word sequence of the current utterance as well as the dialogue history <ref> (Reithinger & Klesen 1997) </ref>. Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998) utilize transformation-based learning to produce rules for determining dialogue acts based on features such as cue phrases, change of speaker, and previous and current dialogue acts.
