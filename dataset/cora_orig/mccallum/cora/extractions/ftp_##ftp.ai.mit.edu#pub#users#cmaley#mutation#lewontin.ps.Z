Title: The Coevolution of Mutation Rates

Abstract: In order to better understand life, it is helpful to look beyond the envelop of life as we know it. A simple model of coevolution was implemented with the addition of genes for longevity and mutation rate in the individuals. This made it possible for a lineage to evolve to be immortal. It also allowed the evolution of no mutation or extremely high mutation rates. The model shows that when the individuals interact in a sort of zero-sum game, the lineages maintain relatively high mutation rates. However, when individuals engage in interactions that have greater consequences for one individual in the interaction than the other, lineages tend to evolve relatively low mutation rates. This model suggests that different genes may have evolved different mutation rates as adaptations to the varying pressures of interactions with other genes.

A single generation consists of four steps. (1) All the organisms interact with each neighbor on either side.
