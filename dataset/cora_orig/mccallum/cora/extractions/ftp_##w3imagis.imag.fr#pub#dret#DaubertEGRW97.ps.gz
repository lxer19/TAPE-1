Abstract: Lighting algorithms for outdoor scenes suffer from the sheer geometric and lighting complexity of such environments. In this paper we introduce an efficient, hierarchical solution to the problem of outdoor illumination. Data structures and sampling algorithms are presented, permitting the integration of complex and natural objects in a hierarchical radiosity simulation system. This new approach allows the hierarchical simulation of radiant energy exchanges in outdoor scenes for the first time, including terrain and botanical models as well as sunlight and skylight. This is accomplished by providing the necessary tools to treat terrain meshes as a hierarchy of light-exchanging objects, as well as an efficient hierarchical representation for the sky dome. In addition, refinement criteria are adapted to the particular characteristics of natural lighting. Results of our implementation are presented including naturally-lit images of terrain-maps, trees and buildings.

Reference-contexts: We briefly review the relevant literature. 2.1 Previous Work in Natural Lighting Much work has been done on modeling daylight with different atmospheric effects and designing global illumination models including such light sources. Several models with different complexity were proposed to compute skylight intensities <ref> [1, 13, 8, 7, 3] </ref>. The public domain system Radiance [20] provides source code (gensky and skybright) to compute sky luminance using the CIE standard sky distribution model [1] for a given setup of hour, day, month, position on earth, and several weather-specific parameters. <p> Several models with different complexity were proposed to compute skylight intensities [1, 13, 8, 7, 3].

The sun position can also be specified directly by providing the solar angles. To represent the skylight distribution, Nishita et al. [13] proposed a fixed set of band sources. <p> Generic edges are defined in an appropriately chosen parameter space, e.g. the mapping of the grid of terrain point data to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 . Neighbourhood informa-tion is most notably needed to correctly perform per-vertex shading (Gouraud shading), and to correctly maintain a restricted subdivision when splitting elements.

Reference-contexts: This link is a (very coarse) representation of all energy transfers in the scene. To achieve the desired quality of lighting simulation, the following sequence of operations needs to be performed <ref> [17, 2, 18] </ref>. 1. Links between H-elements are first refined using a refinement engine, resulting in the subdivision of the corresponding H-elements where appropriate. This is described in more detail in the following paragraph. 2. Once the refinement process is complete, links exist between H-elements at various levels. <p> The initial sky patch is the whole hemisphere, (u; v) 2 [0; =2]fi <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. Every hierarchical sky patch is therefore defined by a parameter range, and the constant radiance value associated with that range. Note that sky patches are characterised by radiance as opposed to radiosity, since they have no area and are positioned at an infinite distance.

Reference-contexts: This method is of course limited to indoor scenes. The most closely related approach to our solution is that of Muller et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. In their algorithm the skylight distribution is directly stored in a set of radiosity patches which are placed far away from the rest of the scene to satisfy error bounds. This is achieved by the use of a regular subdivision of the sky hemisphere. <p> Despite this wealth of algorithms, the hierarchical treatment of these mesh structures has not previously found its way into lighting simulation algorithms. 2.3 Limitations of the Previous Approaches The vast majority of previously described natural lighting algorithms require time consuming preprocessing steps. The method proposed in <ref> [12] </ref> is the first to integrate the sky as a radiosity object, but however a fixed subdivision is used. This is a severe restriction, lacking the benefits of both hierarchical solution [6] and clustering [18] for skylight objects. <p> These two contributions allow the treatment of complex, naturally-lit outdoor scenes, based on clustering and hierarchical radiosity, resulting in efficient and accurate lighting simulations. In contrast to the only previous radiosity-based approach to outdoor lighting <ref> [12] </ref>, our new method requires computation times for scenes of comparable size which are lower than those reported in [12]. <p> In contrast to the only previous radiosity-based approach to outdoor lighting <ref> [12] </ref>, our new method requires computation times for scenes of comparable size which are lower than those reported in [12]. More importantly, the hierarchical nature of our new algorithm ensures that global illumination effects are always accounted for at the chosen level of approximation, which is not possible in the progressive-refinement approaches previously used.

These elements can be clusters (groups of objects) or surfaces. <p> This link is a (very coarse) representation of all energy transfers in the scene. To achieve the desired quality of lighting simulation, the following sequence of operations needs to be performed <ref> [17, 2, 18] </ref>. 1.

This is described in more detail in the following paragraph. 2. Once the refinement process is complete, links exist between H-elements at various levels. <p> This in turn requires an appropriate sampling of a kernel function involving the position, orientation, distance and relative visibility of the two elements. As shown in <ref> [18] </ref> the calculation of form factors can be expressed at an abstract level using virtual functions with spe-cialised behaviour for clusters or surfaces. A typical refiner therefore operates solely on H-elements and relies on virtual functions to perform the necessary subdivision (split). <p> A simple, direct solution would be to pass these elements in an unstructured manner to a clustering algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>. As mentioned previously, this could result in inappropriate groupings of surfaces since the implicit mesh structure and connectivity information is lost. <p> In order to fully integrate sunlight and skylight in a hierarchical radiosity process with clustering, these light sources must become integral hierarchical elements which provide the same interface as the other elements in the simulation <ref> [18] </ref>. Thus we need to define corresponding H-elements (using specialised classes) which can split (be subdivided) to create child elements which represent the source in more detail and with less approximation error. <p> R and S depend on p's element type: For surfaces, R is the cosine between the surface normal and the line through the two elements' samples and S is 1. For volumes and clusters, R is 1 and S is 1=4 <ref> [18] </ref>. In the case of partial visibility, a multiplicative correction factor is applied to model the fraction of mutual visibility [6].
