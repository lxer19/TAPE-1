Title: Chapter 4 ADMISSION CONTROL  
Note: 84  
Abstract: Admission control is a process used by the network to regulate its network load. The admission controller decides whether to admit an incoming flow into the network taking the current network condition into account. It is impossible for a network to fulfill its service commitment without some degree of admission control, even though the commitment might not be deterministic. The nature of the service commitment largely decides the degree of control exercised at the point of admission to the network. In this chapter, we discuss the current research in admission control and propose a new admission control scheme suitable for multimedia applications with both delay and packet loss QoS requirements. This chapter is organized into six sections. Section 4.1 presents a brief introduction to admission control. In this section, we first discuss the existing work in admission control, particularly with respect to the two general approaches: parameter-based approach and measurement-based approach. This discussion concludes that the measurement-based approach|using the measured traffic and QoS performance instead of the worst-case values used by the parameter-based approach|is more appropriate for multimedia applications. However, no existing measurement-based admission controller handles applications with both delay and packet loss QoS requirements. In the second part of Section 4.1, we summarize the focus and contributions of our research in providing a measurement-based admission controller that provides an adaptive and efficient solution for these applications.
