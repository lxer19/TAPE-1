Abstract: Dynamic Base Register Caching (DBRC) [. Farrens Park Compression 1990 .] [. Farrens Park SIGARCH18 1991 .] has been shown to be a useful technique for significantly reducing processor to memory address bandwidth. By caching the higher order portions of memory addresses in a set of dynamically allocated base registers, only small register indices need to be transmitted between the processor and memory instead of the high order address bits themselves. In this paper we present the results of trace driven simulations which indicate that DRBC can facilitate the provision of separate paths for instructions and data by reducing the number of address lines required for parallel address channels. In fact, tailoring DBRC for separate instruction and data streams results in superior address compression. We also show that the effectiveness of DBRC is not significantly degraded by multiprogramming workload, for large Spec benchmark traces. Additionally, we suggest two methods to optimize DBRC implementation. (1) A processor's translation loo-kaside buffer hardware can be modified to implement DBRC in addition to its normal address translation functions. (2) DBRC latency can be hidden by properly synchronizing it with memory chip address pin multiplexing.
