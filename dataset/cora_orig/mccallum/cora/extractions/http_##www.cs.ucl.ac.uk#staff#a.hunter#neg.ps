Reference-contexts: A better understanding of the notion of negation, and its relationship to contradiction, is important for this goal. There have been a number of other approaches to addressing issues of inconsistency in data. First, there are the paraconsistent logics (for example <ref> [ 6; 1; 3 ] </ref> ) that support weaker-than-classical non-trivial reasoning with inconsistent information. But these really only ignore inconsistency. They don't offer machinery for analysing the nature of the inconsistency.

Reference-contexts: However, they don't provide the language for capturing the `degree of inconsistency' between viewpoints. Also relevant are logics that reason with maximally consistent subsets of the data (for example <ref> [ 14; 2; 9 ] </ref> . These qualify inferences, so for example, inferences that follow from all maximally consistent subsets are preferred to inferences that only come from some maximally consistent subsets. However, these also don't provide machinery for analysing inconsistencies between viewpoints.

Reference-contexts: But these really only ignore inconsistency. They don't offer machinery for analysing the nature of the inconsistency. Then there are truth maintenance systems [ 11; 8 ] and non-monotonic reasoning systems (for reviews see <ref> [ 4; 5 ] </ref> which assume some of the information is specified as defeasible, and the system then identifies plausible inferences on this basis. Again they don't offer machinery for analysing the inconsistency.

Reference-contexts: This database is inconsistent. ff and fl are in conflict. However, ffi and * follow from ff and fl without the use of inconsistency. One can compromise by letting ffi and * remain in the database irrespective of what we take out to maintain consistency <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . Another way of increasing coherence is to turn both ff ! fi and fl ! :fi into defeasible rules. Now we cannot deduce fi nor :fi because neither has a clear undefeated proof.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, we could adopt a finer grained approach by for example weakening fi to fi _ fl. There are many open questions here. A particularly important one is what postulates (in the spirit of <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> ) should we adopt for contracting viewpoints. 7 INCOHERENCE In Sections 4 and 5, we considered conflicting pairs of databases or viewpoints. Now, we consider inconsistency within an individual database. Some kinds of inconsistent database seem worse than others. <p> These qualify inferences, so for example, inferences that follow from all maximally consistent subsets are preferred to inferences that only come from some maximally consistent subsets. However, these also don't provide machinery for analysing inconsistencies between viewpoints. Finally there is belief revision theory <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . This focusses on updating a database with a formula, where to maintain consistency, some of the database may have to be rejected. Hence, this doesn't address the needs of reasoning with conflicts, and in particular conflicts between viewpoints.

Reference-contexts: Again they don't offer machinery for analysing the inconsistency. Modal logic, in particular epistemic logics (for review see <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> ), are more closely related to the aim of providing a language for representing and reasoning with conflicts between viewpoints. However, they don't provide the language for capturing the `degree of inconsistency' between viewpoints.

Reference-contexts: Another way of increasing coherence is to turn both ff ! fi and fl ! :fi into defeasible rules. Now we cannot deduce fi nor :fi because neither has a clear undefeated proof. This approach making the particpants defeasible is due to Sanjay Modgil <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> and is compatible with ideas about prioritizing formulae so as to resolve conflict. If we make a statement more defeasible according to how contradictory it is, we can use this information to decide which participants to ignore.

Reference-contexts: NEGATION AND CONTRADICTION 99 There are a number of choices for formalizing the way that formulae in one section can influence another. Alessandra Russo has studied some options where each section is repesented by a possible world in modal logic <ref> [ 15 ] </ref> . 8 DISCUSSION It is becoming more widely acknowledged that we need to develop more sophisticated means for handling inconsistent information. A better understanding of the notion of negation, and its relationship to contradiction, is important for this goal.
