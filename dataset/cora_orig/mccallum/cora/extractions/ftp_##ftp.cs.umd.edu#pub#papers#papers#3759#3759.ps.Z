Reference-contexts: We analyzed inspection interval using linear regression models <ref> [2] </ref>. We built one model for the pre-meeting interval (time from availability to meeting) and another for the post-meeting interval (time from meeting to the completion of repair).

Reference-contexts: Queueing networks are an example of such a model. 7 QUEUEING MODELS FOR INTERVAL ANALYSIS The idea of modeling software development processes as queueing systems was first proposed by Bradac, et al. <ref> [3] </ref>, but little work has since been conducted on analyzing queues for particular applications. Our application suggests a queueing model in which each developer is a server, handling different tasks with different priorities. code, writing their own, and resolving issues from previous inspections.

Reference-contexts: Once the inspection is completed, the code unit is sent into the rework queue of the original developer. Finally, when rework is done, the code unit exits the system. This queueing system may be treated as a preemptive priority queue with feedback. Preemptive priority queues are analyzed in Kleinrock <ref> [6] </ref>. Simon [9] analyzed the case with feedback, where tasks are allowed to feed back into the system and change their priority and service requirements. 10 prioritizes and services his or her tasks. New Inspections require the developer to inspect another's code.

Reference-contexts: Using regression analysis, we found that although these factors explain much of the variation in effectiveness, they do not adequately explain variation in inspection interval <ref> [7] </ref>. In this article we examine whether a fourth factor process environment explains this variation. The process environment is the logistic, organization, and execution context in which a process operates. We conjecture that process environment affects interval when development processes subtly influence one another.

Reference-contexts: Therefore understanding, identifying, and eliminating bottlenecks in software development is extremely important. Until recently, however, little research has addressed this issue. Previously we conducted an industrial experiment at Lucent Technologies to determine which factors drive the cost and benefits of different software inspection processes <ref> [8] </ref>. To date we have explored the following factors. * process structure (e.g., team size, number and sequencing of sessions), * process techniques (e.g., preparation times, inspection rates), and * process inputs (e.g., reviewers, authors, code quality). <p> With the cooperation of professional developers working on an industrial software project at Lucent Technologies, we conducted a controlled experiment to compare the costs and benefits of several different software inspection processes (see Porter, et al. <ref> [8] </ref> for details). The project was to develop a compiler and environment to support developers of the 5ESS TM telephone switching system. The complete system contains over 55K new lines of C++ code, plus another 10K which was reused from a prototype.

Reference-contexts: Finally, when rework is done, the code unit exits the system. This queueing system may be treated as a preemptive priority queue with feedback. Preemptive priority queues are analyzed in Kleinrock [6].

New Inspections require the developer to inspect another's code. New Code represents unfinished code the developer is writing. <p> The former case is known as bulk arrivals and the latter is known as branching. The presence of bulk arrivals and branching means that tasks may not be independent of each other. There has been some previous work on this problem <ref> [9] </ref>. Hidden Dependencies. There may be other unknown dependencies between tasks which may cause one to wait on another. Miscellaneous Tasks. There may be other tasks that consume a significant amount of the developers' time and that must be accounted for. External Servers.
