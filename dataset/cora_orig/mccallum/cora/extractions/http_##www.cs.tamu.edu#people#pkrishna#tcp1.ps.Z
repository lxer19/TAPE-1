Abstract: This paper presents a technique to provide seamless communication in mobile wireless networks. The goal of seamless communication is to make the motion of a mobile host transparent to the applications executing on it. Active handoffs (handoffs during an active connection) cause pauses in communication between the mobile host and the fixed network, resulting in applications seeing a substantial performance degradation. The motivation behind this study is to find a cost effective solution for minimizing impact of active handoffs on connection throughput. Existing solutions either provide total guarantee for seamless communication, incurring heavy network bandwidth usage (multicast based approach), or do not provide any guarantee for seamless communication (unicast based approach). Some other solutions are tuned to give good performance for specific protocols (e.g., fast-retransmit approach). This paper proposes a novel staggered multicast approach which provides a probabilistic guarantee for seamless communication independent of the communication protocol used. The main advantage of the staggered multicast approach is that it exploits the performance guarantees provided by the multicast approach and also provides the much required savings in the wired network bandwidth. fl Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program under grants 999903-029, and 009741-052-C y This report supersedes TR-95-046

Reference-contexts: Handoff helps to maintain an end-to-end connectivity in the dynamically reconfigurable network topology. Providing connection-oriented communication [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] to mobile users, requires that the user be always connected to the rest of the network in the presence of user mobility. Providing seamless communication <ref> [1, 8] </ref> is a stronger requirement than mere connection-oriented communication; in addition to maintaining the connection, the network needs to ensure that the performance does not degrade due to handoffs. <p> Their solutions lay excellent groundwork for research in this area but did not guarantee seamless communication. In fact their scheme was shown to suffer from extended intervals of time when service to the mobile host was disrupted. A study done in <ref> [1] </ref> shows that if the handoff protocol required forwarding data between the BSs connected by physical links, then a high bandwidth (between 48Mbps and 96Mbps) is required just to forward these data packets. Moreover, loops can be formed in the connection path if forwarding is employed. <p> Moreover, loops can be formed in the connection path if forwarding is employed. This will lead to inefficient network utilization. Total Multicast Based Approach: A total multicast based solution was proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this approach, the data packets for a mobile host are multicast to the BSs of the neighbor 5 ing cells so that when the host moves to a new cell, there are data packets already waiting for it and thus, there is no break in service. <p> It is evident, however, that this scheme is not cost effective. As the number of users in the network increases, the amount of network bandwidth used up by the multicast connections is going be prohibitively high. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the cost of such a multicast scheme was determined to be the buffer overhead at the BSs. <p> More intelligent choices of g i may be made based on user mobility patterns as well as its current location, speed, direction of motion, topological constraints <ref> [1] </ref> etc. User Profile: A user-profile is a record specific to and maintained individually by each mobile host m i . It contains the following information. 9 * l avg : The average value of cell latency over all handoffs (since connection start up) for m i . <p> We determine the overhead of the staggered 12 multicast scheme as the fraction of the total connection time spent in the multicast mode, Overhead = T m Note that for a total multicast solution <ref> [1] </ref>, P disrupt = 0 & Overhead = 1 While for a unicast solution, P disrupt = 1 & Overhead = 0 It is clear that the performance of our approach is always lower bounded by the performance of the unicast approach, and upper bounded by the performance of the multicast

Reference-contexts: The results presented in this paper are for bulk data transfer from a fixed host to a mobile host (forward direction). This is a more realistic scenario than transfer of data from the mobile host to the fixed host (reverse direction). The authors in <ref> [3] </ref> observed very little difference in the results obtained for data transfer in either direction for their scheme. We will thus use their results for comparing the effectiveness of our scheme for TCP even though the direction of data transfer in our case is opposite to theirs. <p> Fast-Retransmit Approach: Caceres and Iftode in <ref> [3] </ref> present a fast-retransmit approach to reduce the effect of active handoffs on throughput for TCP connections. During handoff a mobile host sends a certain number of duplicate acknowledgments to the sender. This causes the source to immediately retransmit the lost datagrams and invoke congestion control measures. <p> While these topologies are by no means exhaustive, they do cover a wide spectrum of cell topologies. Our intent is to show that even though the staggered multicast approach is generic, it performs quite well for TCP when compared to specific approaches fine tuned just for TCP <ref> [3] </ref>. The user-profile transmitted by m i to the base station during handoff, is used by the mgm to calculate t i (t i = stagger fi l avg ). 5 Results Figures 5, 6 and 7 summarize the results of our experiments for the three cell topologies mentioned. <p> The vertical axis in Figure 6 denotes the fraction of the maximum throughput achievable when staggered multicast is used as compared to when total multicast is used. As is expected, average achievable throughput decreases with increase in stagger. The improvements in throughput for TCP in <ref> [3] </ref>, are similar to the improvements in average throughput obtained by our scheme for similar cell topologies. One interesting observation in this result is that even though Cell Topology I has 0 seconds blackout period, the throughput achievable is not equal to the throughput of the total multicast scheme.

Reference-contexts: Note that simply forwarding data packets to the new base station does not provide any guarantees for seamless communication. 1 Base stations are sometimes called mobile support stations. 3 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <ref> [4] </ref> is the most popular reliable connection--oriented protocol in use in the internet today. Commonly used network applications such as ftp, telnet, NFS, www-access etc., rely on this protocol for their network communication.

Reference-contexts: The parameter ssthresh is used to control the rate of growth of cwnd depending on the state of network congestion perceived by the source. If the TCP source percepts congestion on the network, it invokes congestion control measures <ref> [5] </ref> which result in the following series of events: * The congestion window decreases thus limiting the amount of unacknowledged data on the network * The connection goes into slow-start which throttles the rate at which the window can grow to previous levels * The backoff interval of the retransmission timer
