Title: Ordinal Measures for Image Correspondence  
Author: Dinkar N. Bhat and Shree K. Nayar 
Keyword: Image matching, Stereo, Ordinal Measures, Correlation, Correspondence  
Abstract: We present ordinal measures of association for image correspondence in the context of stereo. Linear correspondence measures like correlation and the sum of squared difference between intensity distributions are known to be fragile. Ordinal measures which are based on relative ordering of intensity values in windows rank permutations have demonstrable robustness. By using distance metrics between two rank permutations, ordinal measures are defined. These measures are independent of absolute intensity scale and invariant to monotone transformations of intensity values like gamma variation between images. We have developed simple algorithms for their efficient implementation. Experiments suggest the superiority of ordinal measures over existing techniques under non-ideal conditions. These measures serve as a general tool for image matching that are applicable to other vision problems such as motion estimation and texture-based image retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The ratio between two measurements is not of consequence; only their relative ordering is relevant. The relative ordering between measurements is expressed by their ranks. A rank permutation is obtained by sorting the sample in ascending order and labeling them using integers <ref> [1; 2; : : : ; n] </ref>, n being the size of the sample. In our application, intensity is viewed as an ordinal variable. Consequently, ordinal correlation measures are based on rank permutations within windows rather than absolute intensity data. <p> The concepts underlying ordinal measures are now introduced using distance metrics. 3.2 Review A ranking which represents the relative ordering between values of an ordinal variable is simply a permutation of integers. More precisely, if S n denotes the set of all permutations of integers <ref> [1; 2; : : : ; n] </ref>, then any ranking is an element of this set. To define correlation between two rankings 1 ; 2 , we require a measure of closeness a distance metric - between them. <p> metric d ( 1 ; 2 ) is defined, a coefficient of correlation ff can be obtained as: ff = 1 M where M is the maximum value of d ( 1 ; 2 ); 8 ( 1 ; 2 ) 2 S n . ff lies in the range <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. M is attained when the two permutations are reverses of each other, and hence ff = 1. <p> In [2], we discuss the discriminatory power of in more detail. 3.5 Experiments with Synthetic Images We compared the ordinal measures with SSD ,NCC , and Zabih and Woodfill rank transform. We used the test suite <ref> [1] </ref> consisting of four sequences of images generated as benchmarks for matching algorithms. In each sequence, one parameter is varied; we will use sequences in which the noise level is varied. No pair of images in a sequence are stereoscopic since viewpoint between them remains unchanged.

The Kendall's t and the Spearman's can also be expressed using distance metrics (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Kendall's t computes the number of discordant pairs between samples, and the Spearman's estimates the Euclidean distance between permutations. Data inconsistency can occur between corresponding windows due to the presence of specular reflection and discontinuities. <p> Below, we present a method for defining the distance between rank permutations along the lines reported by [6]. However, our measure is motivated by the definition of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic (see <ref> [2] </ref>). 4 Here we assume that there are no ties in the data. The method to handle tied values is discussed in [2]. A composition permutation s can be defined as follows: s i = k 1 ) i (3) where 1 1 denotes the inverse permutation of 1 . <p> However, our measure is motivated by the definition of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic (see <ref> [2] </ref>). 4 Here we assume that there are no ties in the data.

The inverse permutation is defined as follows: If i 1 = j, then ( 1 1 ) j = i. <p> The maximum value that any component of the distance vector can take is b n 2 c which must occur in the case of perfect negative correlation (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Now, a measure of correlation (I 1 ; I 2 ) is defined as: (I 1 ; I 2 ) = 1 i=1 d i b n (5) Unlike [6], we do not consider the deviation from the negative identity permutation since that is computationally more expensive. <p> This implies independence from camera gain and bias. b) It is symmetrical, i.e (I 1 ; I 2 ) = (I 2 ; I 1 ). Hence, either image can be used as reference (see <ref> [2] </ref>) c) (f (I 1 ); h (I 2 )) = (I 1 ; I 2 ) where f and h are monotonically increasing functions. To illustrate this property, consider the case when different cameras are used for stereo and have different responses to image irradiance. <p> However, as with any window-based measure, continually increasing the window size causes performance to degrade because of increased false positives in the occlusion regions and smoothing of disparity values across depth boundaries. Choosing the appropriate window size is an issue for which we do not have a solution. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we discuss the discriminatory power of in more detail. 3.5 Experiments with Synthetic Images We compared the ordinal measures with SSD ,NCC , and Zabih and Woodfill rank transform. We used the test suite [1] consisting of four sequences of images generated as benchmarks for matching algorithms. <p> This is in addition to the sort operations to perform ranking. We developed a simple O (n) algorithm for building d m while simultaneously evaluating max n i=1 d i m (see <ref> [2] </ref> for details). Mathematically, our algorithm states that, d i+1 m j=1 The costly operations are therefore those of sorting window data which is O (n log n). <p> Point 18 was matched inaccurately, the possible reason being that the window which straddles it is largely untextured. Also, correspondence at point 8 was off by 2 pixels. All other points (26 of them) was matched correctly to the nearest pixel. The complete results of matching is tabulated in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Next, we present results with the rather popular stereo image pair of the Pentagon (see Figure 7).

Reference-contexts: Further, by definition, they are not suitable in the presence of non-linear intensity variation at corresponding pixels. Since the Euclidean norm (SSD) is sensitive to outliers, robust M-estimators have been used that are more resilient (for instance, the Lorentzian in motion estimation <ref> [3] </ref>). The characteristic of robust estimators is that they cause outliers to contribute less weight compared to inliers. Most M-estimators include a parameter that needs to be set beforehand: the point at which measurements must be considered outliers.

Reference-contexts: Like SSD it appraises the degree of linearity between the samples being compared. It is closely related to the least squares line of fit <ref> [4] </ref>, hence NCC has similar properties to SSD. The absolute value of NCC lies between 0 and 1, and a value of 1 indicates perfect matching windows. While NCC is preferable since it is invariant to linear brightness and contrast variations between perfect matching windows, SSD is computationally more attractive. <p> The loss of information due to the choice of an ordinal scale of measurement is the price one pays for robustness, and is a well-known trade-off in non-parametric statistics <ref> [4] </ref>. One factor that affects discriminatory power is the window size. 7 the left image. This pair is used to test with other measures. Locating right matches with such significant image degradation is the computational challenge.

Reference-contexts: Here, the problems are addressed from a different basis, namely, the use of an ordinal scale for intensity. We introduce ordinal measures of association ([6], <ref> [7] </ref>) that are robust to a high degree. An ordinal variable implies one drawn from a discrete ordered set like the grades in school. The ratio between two measurements is not of consequence; only their relative ordering is relevant. The relative ordering between measurements is expressed by their ranks. <p> In our application, intensity is viewed as an ordinal variable. Consequently, ordinal correlation measures are based on rank permutations within windows rather than absolute intensity data. Two known ordinal measures include the Kendall's t and the Spearman's <ref> [7] </ref>. Both coefficients are relatively unaffected by the presence of random data outliers like noise, in comparison to direct image correlation. However, if the ranks within each window are distorted like in the presence of projective distortion, they are not satisfactory.

Reference-contexts: It is desirable to have a universal measure of correlation independent of absolute intensity scale and experimental conditions. Image transform methods are based on comparing stereo images transformed using local window measures. Kories and Zimmerman's <ref> [8] </ref> monotonicity operator, Zabih and Woodfill [11] rank transform and census transform fall in this category.

Image transform methods are based on comparing stereo images transformed using local window measures. Kories and Zimmerman's [8] monotonicity operator, Zabih and Woodfill <ref> [11] </ref> rank transform and census transform fall in this category.

This attractive property of ordinal measures motivates us to apply them for stereo matching. The same robustness can also be observed of local transform techniques like that of Zabih and Woodfill <ref> [11] </ref>. The concepts underlying ordinal measures are now introduced using distance metrics. 3.2 Review A ranking which represents the relative ordering between values of an ordinal variable is simply a permutation of integers.
