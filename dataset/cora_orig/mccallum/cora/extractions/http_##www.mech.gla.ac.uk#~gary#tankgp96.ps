Reference-contexts: Indeed, this is one of the main application areas of genetic programming. Genetic programming has been applied to the development of signal processing algorithms (Sharman, Esparcia & Li, 1995) and to the identification of chemical processes <ref> (Bettenhausen et al., 1995) </ref>. It allows optimisation of a tree structure representation of a symbolic expression. This tree structure is of variable length and is constructed of nodes.

Reference-contexts: In this way, examination of several solutions of the optimisation gives likely components of the nonlinear model of the system. More conventional modelling procedures can be used to further develop the model. 2.2. Genetic programming The genetic programming was done using a modified version of gpc++ <ref> (Fraser, 1994) </ref>. This program is available on the internet and is written in C++ and was easy to modify to include the simulated annealing routine and the simulation program for the fitness function evaluation.

Reference-contexts: It was included in the genetic programming function set to allow the genetic programming to evolve certain dynamics for some values of H 2 and different dynamics for others. Such a combination of weighted models is known as a local model network <ref> (Gray et al. 1996) </ref>. This was not unreasonable since it is known that turbulent flow is more likely to occur at higher values of pressure differential. The terminal nodes were the system input, the states, and 0 and 1.

Reference-contexts: It would be more efficient to be able to use an optimisation method to automatically determine the structure of the physical model. This paper reports an automatic procedure which can identify nonlinear structure components of a continuous time dynamic model from experimental data. Genetic Programming (GP) <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref> can be used to evolve algebraic expressions from a database of nonlinear algebraic functional elements. Indeed, this is one of the main application areas of genetic programming.

Reference-contexts: The models are randomly generated and will therefore contain linearly dependent parameters and parameters which have no effect on the output, so gradient based methods cannot be used. The method chosen was a combination of Nelder-Simplex and simulated annealing <ref> (Press et al 1992) </ref>. Simulated annealing optimises by a method which is analogous to the cooling process of a metal. As a metal cools, the atoms organise themselves into an ordered minimum energy structure. The amount of vibration or movement in the atoms is dependent on temperature.

Reference-contexts: The Colebrook-White equation is solved to give f; Whether flow is laminar or turbulent depends on the (9) Reynolds number. But there is a crucial regime between laminar and turbulent flow where the flow can be a combination of these or one or the other <ref> (Thomas, 1995) </ref>. The only variable in the water tank system is the pressure difference which is directly proportional to the depth difference of the water at either end of the pipe.
