Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The CHORUS experiment <ref> [1] </ref> depends critically on the relative alignment of its subdetectors to maintain a high efficiency. In particular, its fiber trackers and a newly installed honeycomb tracking chamber are designed to determine track trajectories with a precision of 100-200 m.

Reference-contexts: In particular, its fiber trackers and a newly installed honeycomb tracking chamber are designed to determine track trajectories with a precision of 100-200 m. Therefore, we require knowledge of the detectors' absolute positions and movements with at least this precision. The honeycomb chambers <ref> [2] </ref> are mounted on aluminum supports and subject to the temperature changes of the hall. As a result movements of order 300 m could be expected.

Reference-contexts: The CHORUS experiment determines the positions of its elements using surveys, through-going muons, cosmic rays and tracks in neutrino data. In 1996, CHORUS began to monitor the relative alignments of some detector elements with the RAS-NIK system (Relative Alignment System of NIKhef), developed at NIKHEF, Amster-dam <ref> [3] </ref>. This system provides an inexpensive (~$500/channel) means of determining relative positions with an accuracy better than 2 m along two axes, and of order 30 m (e.g., for a 60 cm source-to-CCD distance) along the third axis.

Reference-contexts: One sees almost no correlated movement (0:3% correlation). The residual correlation may be due to non-orthogonality of the mounting. A new version of the analysis software determines any non-orthogonality of the mounting (and removes their effects) by measuring the skewness of the video image <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the correlation is sufficiently small for this application. There is no calibration of the system necessary for movements along the two axes orthogonal to the infrared beam.
