Abstract: Recently, randomizing input transformations have been developed for streamlining Gaussian elimination. Multiplying by special sparse random matrices, these transformations produce an equivalent linear system which, with probability 1, Gaussian elimination can solve without any augmentation by pivoting. In this paper we study properties of the unitary Randomizing Discrete Fourier Transform (RDFT), which scales rows by random values from the complex unit circle and then applies the conventional DFT. When the problem size is a power of 2, the Randomizing Fast Fourier Transform (RFFT) algorithm can efficiently implement the RDFT, using existing FFT code, on the many parallel and vector machines whose architectures support FFT-like computations.

Reference-contexts: Gaussian elimination works only when, for all 1 k n 1, the a (k) kk are nonzero. It is well-known <ref> [2, p.96] </ref> that this is equivalent to the following: An n fi n matrix A is Gauss eliminable iff all its leading principal submatrices are nonsingular. Copyright c fl1995 D. Stott Parker & Brad Pierce 5 Lemma 2 Let F n be a DFT matrix of size n. <p> Because ! n is a primitive nth root of unity, the x j are distinct, hence the Vander-monde matrix must be nonsingular <ref> [2, p.178ff] </ref>. 2 Theorem 2 The RDFT yields Gauss eliminable matrices, i.e.: with probability 1, if A is an n fi n nonsingular matrix, then Gaussian elimination can operate without any pivoting on e A = (F n R)A and on b A = A (F n R) fl .
