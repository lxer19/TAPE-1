Abstract: This paper presents a survey of two-pass global illumination algorithms that use a local pass (gather) and shadow ray optimization techniques as well as a new two-pass algorithm which relies on spatial coherence to efficiently handle the problem of numerous luminaires. The algorithm presented operates on scenes with Lambertian reflectors and luminaires with arbitrary emission distributions. A radiosity prepass is performed on a simplified version of the scene. Bright reflecting surfaces are reclassified as light sources. A spatial data structure is then built that associates bright visible surfaces to regions in the environment. The visibility of these surfaces is probabilistically estimated. Finally, a view-dependent "gather" is performed at each pixel. This gather is made significantly more efficient than previous algorithms because of careful integration based on the contents of the spatial data structure.

Reference-contexts: devoted to realistic rendering, a general and practical algorithm for producing physically accurate images of complex environments does not exist. 2 Kurt Zimmerman and Peter Shirley In scenes with specular surfaces, "two-pass" methods have been used to add eye S ? DS ? light paths to illumination ray traced scenes <ref> [2] </ref>, and to add eye S ? D ? light paths when rendering precomputed radiosity solutions [23]. If the radiosity method has form-factors that account for specular transport, then all diffuse-specular transport chains are accounted for [12, 1, 19, 6].

A potential problem with many two-pass methods is that a texture map or mesh must be used to represent the irradiance on diffuse surfaces. This limits the utility of such methods for complex scenes. <p> GSII also uses r thresh to determine how much the radiosity environment is simplified. This allows GSII to produce a range of solutions from the Progressive Multi-pass Solution <ref> [3] </ref> if r thresh = 0 to MCPT if r thresh is greater than the maximum distance between two points in the environment. 8 Kurt Zimmerman and Peter Shirley 2.6 Efficient Explicit Gathers The explicit gather as noted in Section 2.4 requires that rays be sent to every patch or, in
