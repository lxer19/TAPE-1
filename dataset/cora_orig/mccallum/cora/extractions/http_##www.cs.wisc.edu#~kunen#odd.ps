Abstract: With the aid of automated reasoning techniques, we show that all previously known short single axioms for odd exponent groups are special cases of one general schema. We also demonstrate how to convert the proofs generated by an automated reasoning system into proofs understandable by a human. x0. Introduction. There are two eras in the history of single axioms for groups and varieties of groups. The early results, by Neumann and others [7], often produced single axioms which were larger than the minimal possible size, but which were constructed via some scheme which made them easy to verify by hand. Although not optimal, these results had the virtue that a person could conceptually grasp their proofs. The second era began with the advent of McCune's automated reasoning system OTTER [4]; now one could produce shorter and simpler single axioms, which often required much more complex verifications. Short single axioms for groups and some varieties of groups were found by McCune and Wos [5,6], and by Kunen [2,3]; in many cases, these axioms were shown to be of optimal size. The results in these latter four papers had the defect that no insight was given into why the single axiom worked. The proofs often consisted of instructions on how to set up the OTTER input, and the reason given for considering a particular axiom was often that it survived an exhaustive computer search. In this paper, we have our cake and eat it too at least in the case of single axioms for odd exponent groups. We produce a large class of such axioms of minimal size, and we give conceptual proofs that these axioms are correct. We, too, used OTTER as a reasoning assistant, as advocated by Larry Wos, but found that by examining the output from our assistant, we could provide conceptual proofs which a human could also understand. This conceptual understanding, in turn, led us to discover more axioms. We present most of our results in their final polished form, as theorems and proofs which can easily be checked by the reader without the aid of a computer. However, at the end of x3, we shall give one specific detailed example explaining the translation of OTTER output into this form. We begin with our notation. We shall use i for the group inverse operation and e or 1 for a group identity. We shall use symbols such as fl or # to denote product operations, written in infix as usual, with products associating to the right, and we often omit the product symbol. We use exponentiation as a further abbreviation, with x 1 abbreviating x

Reference-contexts: For Theorem 5.2, likewise, it is enough to consider a Z p . For the case p = 2, a 10-element model was constructed in [2] using a Steiner triple system with 9 points (an S (2; 3; 9) see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref> for notation). For an arbitrary prime p, that proof generalizes to produce a model of size (p 1)k + 1 from an S (2; p + 1; k). However, the following direct proof avoids the use of Steiner systems. Proof of 5.2.

Reference-contexts: For example, the following is a minor variant of a single axiom of McCune (see x5 of <ref> [2] </ref> for a discussion): If this equation is valid in H, then fl H must be a group operation and i H must be the group inverse operation; but e H need not be the group identity. So, this is not a counterexample to Theorem 5.1. <p> So, this is not a counterexample to Theorem 5.1. The second result shows that no variety of groups can be axiomatized by any set of equations with only two variables. For the variety of all groups, this was shown in <ref> [2] </ref>, but the argument there does not easily generalize to arbitrary varieties. This result is used to limit the candidates for single axioms for groups or varieties of groups; see x6 and [2,3]. Again, the trivial variety, consisting of the one element group, is an exception. 5.2 Theorem. <p> For Theorem 5.2, likewise, it is enough to consider a Z p .

Reference-contexts: This is proved in Theorem 5.5. 2 We confine ourselves in this paper to such axioms of minimal possible size. The existence of arbitrarily long single axioms for groups of exponent n is immediate by a general result of Neumann [7]; see also <ref> [3] </ref>. For even n &gt; 2, short single axioms are known only in the case of exponent 4, and the axioms with e [6] do not bear much resemblance to the axioms without e [3]. <p> for groups of exponent n is immediate by a general result of Neumann [7]; see also <ref> [3] </ref>. For even n &gt; 2, short single axioms are known only in the case of exponent 4, and the axioms with e [6] do not bear much resemblance to the axioms without e [3]. For small odd exponents, a number of such axioms, with and without e, were described by McCune and Wos [6]. <p> We conjecture that these do not imply the rest of the cycle equations, or the group axioms, but we do not have a model to prove this. In <ref> [3] </ref>, the two bad apples in a cycle were refuted by a trivial Knuth-Bendix argument, since they failed to unify with any proper subterms of themselves, but that simple argument does not work here. <p> Associativity is very strong. In the presence of associativity, any of the axioms in this paper imply the group axioms. For axioms of the form x n fl y fl z n = y, this was shown in <ref> [3] </ref> Lemma 3.1. 5.4 Theorem. Assume G satisfies associativity and x n fl y fl z i fl e fl z j = y, where n &gt; 0, and i; j 0. Then G is a group of exponent n, and e is the identity. Proof. <p> Finally, we justify our restriction to associative variants of x n yz n = y when considering short single axioms for exponent n groups. For even n, this was done in <ref> [3] </ref>, and now Theorem 5.2 allows us to extend the result for all n. Recall that V (ff) is the number of variable occurrences in ff. 5.5 Theorem. <p> The fact that ff is of the claimed form now follows directly from the fact (see, e.g., Lemma 2.2 of <ref> [3] </ref>) that if n &gt; 2 and 0 &lt; i &lt; n, there is a group of exponent n in which the equation (x i yx ni = y) is not valid. x6. Other odd exponent axioms. <p> Theorem. Suppose (ff = y) is a single axiom for groups of exponent 3, where ff is an associative variant of x 3 yz 3 . Then (ff = y) or its mirror is a member of the cycle G:3. Proof. By exhaustive search, as in <ref> [3] </ref>, although the search is a little shorter here. There are only 132 associative variants of x 3 yz 3 , and it is easy to write a simple Prolog program which generates all of them and eliminates those which are refuted by some simple ring models.

Reference-contexts: For example, x fl (x fl (x fl y) fl z) fl z fl z = y ; (A:3:1) discovered by McCune and Wos (equation 4.3 of <ref> [6] </ref>), is a single axiom for groups of exponent 3. <p> An example, also taken from <ref> [6] </ref> (equation 4.10) is the following single axiom for groups of exponent 3: x fl (x fl (x fl y) fl z) fl e fl z fl z = y : (B:3:1) However, we do not call x fl (x fl (x fl y) fl z) fl (e fl e fl <p> The existence of arbitrarily long single axioms for groups of exponent n is immediate by a general result of Neumann [7]; see also [3]. For even n &gt; 2, short single axioms are known only in the case of exponent 4, and the axioms with e <ref> [6] </ref> do not bear much resemblance to the axioms without e [3]. For small odd exponents, a number of such axioms, with and without e, were described by McCune and Wos [6]. <p> &gt; 2, short single axioms are known only in the case of exponent 4, and the axioms with e <ref> [6] </ref> do not bear much resemblance to the axioms without e [3]. For small odd exponents, a number of such axioms, with and without e, were described by McCune and Wos [6]. For the most part, these axioms seemed unrelated, although McCune and Wos detected a few patterns in axioms for exponents 3 and 5 and extended the patterns to a sequence of axioms for odd exponents. <p> We also discovered a conceptual proof that the pattern provides axioms for groups of odd exponent. Now, equation A:3:1 generalizes in three ways. First, as noticed by McCune and Wos <ref> [6] </ref>, the axiom extends to larger odd exponents, producing axiom A:n:1 for every odd n 3. For example, the exponent 7 axiom is xxx (xxx (xy)z)z 6 = y : (A:7:1) Second, replacing the z 6 by some particular other associative variants of z 6 produces still more axioms. <p> (xxx (xxxxy)z)z 6 = y (A:7:4) xxx (xxxxyz 6 )z = y (A:7:5) xx (xxxx (xy)z 6 )z = y (A:7:6) x (xxxx (xxy)z 6 )z = y (A:7:7) (xxxx (xxxy)z 6 )z = y (A:7:8) xxxx (xxxyz)z 6 = y (A:7:9) Cycle A:7 Equation A:7:5 is equation 4.7 from <ref> [6] </ref>, and McCune and Wos verified that this pattern extends to all odd exponents. They also conjectured that pattern A:7:1 generalizes, which we verify here. In fact, we show (Theorem 1.4) that the members of such a family are all equivalent except (possibly) for A:7:4 and A:7:9. <p> However, e fl g (z) could fail; for example, in exponent 5, e fl (zz)(zz) fails. However, g (z) = e fl z 2m does work, as was conjectured by McCune and Wos <ref> [6] </ref>, who, with the help of OTTER, verified it up to exponent 19. Sections 1 and 2 contain some consequences of G:n:1, which hold for all g (z). In particular, in x2, we show that g (z) working is equivalent to a statement about automorphisms of groups. <p> The results of this paper were obtained by a combination of mathematics and hacking. In an attempt to prove that the single axioms of McCune and Wos <ref> [6] </ref> extend to arbitrary odd exponents, we expressed the axioms abstractly in terms of our functions f and g. Then, the "cycle" idea enabled us to consider whole families of these axioms at once. We used OTTER to derive as much as we could for an arbitrary g (z).
