Reference-contexts: This configuration thus determines the Cartesian coordinates x 1 and x 2 of the tip of the arm. The function that relates these variables is the forward kinematic function x = g (). This function can be always computed unambiguously. Its practical calculation involves multiplying frame matrices <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 The forward kinematic function g () is a many-to-one mapping: that is, for every Cartesian position inside the boundary of the workspace, there are an infinite number of joint-angle configurations to achieve that position. <p> Given the numerical value of the coordinates of the tip of the manipulator it is necessary to find values of the joint angles <ref> [1] </ref>. As with any nonlinear set of equations, the primary concerns here are the existence of solutions, the multiplicity of the solutions and the method of solution. The question of whether solutions exist or not is related to the concept of manipulator workspace. <p> For example, it has been shown that all systems with revolute and prismatic joints having a total of six degrees of freedom in a single series chain are now solvable by numerical methods <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.3 Neural networks for adaptive control The solution methods based on neural networks form a class clearly distinct from the two classes of methods described above. Neural nets do not operate on analytical transformations; rather, their behavior is based on uniform nonlinear signal processing. <p> It provides a way to reduce the MSE to an arbitrary small value, thus assuring repeatability, in robotics terms, of the kinematics being modeled, i.e. all training positions will be perfectly learned and repeated whenever this is necessary <ref> [1] </ref>. However, this is not the ultimate goal of the whole enterprise. We actually need not only repeatability, but most important, we need accuracy, i.e good generalization on unknown input. We can show that DSL does not always provide accuracy by means of a simple example .

Reference-contexts: The idea is to observe the input/output behavior of the environment and to train the inverse model directly by reversing the roles of the inputs and outputs. Data are provided to the algorithm by sampling in action space and observing the results in sensation space <ref> [4] </ref>. However, a major problem arises when the input/output mapping behavior of the environment is many to one. In such a case the inverse mapping will map more than one images to a given point. <p> The mean squared error (MSE) will never get to zero, no matter what the weights of the approximating neural network are <ref> [4] </ref>. DSL is a powerful technique for modeling inverses of functions that are not one-to-one.

Reference-contexts: The same effect is observed when we do straightforward inverse modeling, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. We performed direct inverse modeling for the two cases (Figure 7a and Figure 8a), and the results look similar to those from Figures 7b and 8b. 5 Conclusions The method of distal supervised learning proved to be successful in learning the inverse kinematics of a six DoF anthropomorphic robot.

Reference-contexts: was a 6 DoF anthropomorphic robot called OSCAR-6 (<ref> [10] </ref>). The coordinate frames of the robot are shown in Figure 2: 3 In our experiments we used all six joints of the robot. Throughout our work we used a simulator of the robot, called Simderella, developed at the University of Amsterdam [10]. The simulator is implemented as a distributed system, communicating through Berkley sockets in UNIX environment.
