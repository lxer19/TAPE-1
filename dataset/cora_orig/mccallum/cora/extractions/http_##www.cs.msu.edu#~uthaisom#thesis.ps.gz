Reference-contexts: Wolfe and Swaminathan [36] studied bell pepper grading by shape. In many studies, optical filters were used to enhance the contrast among different kinds of surfaces. Several studies [7, 12, 18, 26, 27, 28, 30] used optical filters in automatic grading. Affeldt and Winner <ref> [1] </ref> and Parker [22] reported that using optical filters helps enhance the human perceptibility of defects on fruits. A number of studies [19, 22, 32, 33] analyzed fruit spectral reflectance to find optimal wavelengths that give the most contrast between different surface types.

Reference-contexts: The images are black and white with 256 gray levels. The size of the cherries that appear in the images are approximately 400 pixels in diameter. Finally, images are converted into hips format (.hips) so that they can be input to hips <ref> [6] </ref> software. 3.2 Problems in Image Acquisition There are three major problems in the imaging process. The first problem is focusing on the cherries. The second problem is the misalignment of different images taken from the same cherry orientation. The third problem is the structured noise in infrared images.
