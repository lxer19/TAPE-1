Abstract: In a practical sense, database mining applications involve semi-automatic data analysis methods that help users to discover some non-trivial knowledge. We are interested in four kinds of database mining queries: association, hypothesis testing, classification, and characterization. Since these queries can be viewed as special cases of data dependencies in a relation, the rough set theory provides a sound basis for investigating database mining. We propose four classification methods in an algebraic approximation space and compare them in terms of their classification quality. We also show that these methods are in fact special cases of classification methods in a probabilistic approximation space. The result of a classification method, regardless of type of space on which it is based, is called a decision algorithm, which can be either consistent or inconsistent. In order to keep a decision algorithm from becoming obsolete, some kind of frequency information must be associated with it. This information is called incremental information. The incremental information is also used for interpreting an inconsistent decision algorithm deterministically or nondeterministically. We extend the notion of decision tables from the rough set theory to accommodate incremental information for the classification of objects.

Reference-contexts: Since the classification methods operate on decision tables, in the first step we gather relevant data using retrieval operations of DBMS. Let m be the number of objects in U: The time complexity of generating a decision algorithm, Step 2, is polynomial in m of degree two <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> As far as the last issue goes, which requires the re-use of the decision algorithms for similar database mining queries, we have presented fuzzy operations between EDTs in <ref> [1] </ref>. These can be re-used to construct a new decision algorithm out of relevant EDTs. 6 Conclusion The contributions of our work can be summarized as follows.
