Title: Line Labeling Using Markov Random Fields  
Author: Terry Regier 
Date: November 1991  
Pubnum: TR-91-059  
Abstract: The task of obtaining a line labeling from a greyscale image of trihedral objects presents difficulties not found in the classical line labeling problem. As originally formulated, the line labeling problem assumed that each junction was correctly pre-classified as being of a particular junction type (e.g. T, Y, arrow); the success of the algorithms proposed have depended critically upon getting this initial junction classification correct. In real images, however, junctions of different types may actually look quite similar, and this pre-classification is often difficult to achieve. This issue is addressed by recasting the line labeling problem in terms of a coupled probabilistic system which labels both lines and junctions. This results in a robust system, in which prior knowledge of acceptable configurations can serve to overcome the problem of misleading or ambiguous evidence. fl This work was supported by ONR contract N00014-85-K-0692 and ONR grant N00014-89-J-1251 to Donald Glaser of UC Berkeley. The author gratefully acknowledges support from him, and from Jerome Feldman of the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. Jitendra Malik of UC Berkeley suggested the application of MRFs to the line labeling problem.

Reference-contexts: However if a neighboring node is background, the current node is probably not foreground. This is essentially the same as the region-growing cliques presented in <ref> [Geman and Geman, 1984] </ref>. * c: Oriented lines tend to continue at the same orientation. While considerations of space do not allow an exhaustive listing here of the cliques used by the system, this should serve to convey a sense for the sorts of cliques used.

In this task, there are a number of difficulties which are not present in the original formulation of the line labeling problem, or in subsequent work <ref> [Waltz, 1975; Malik, 1985] </ref>. It has generally been assumed that input will be in the form of an idealized line drawing, with each junction correctly pre-classified into one of several types (e.g. T, Y, arrow, etc). <p> Figure 2 presents two examples of this. In (a), the circled Y junction is flat enough to be quite similar to a T junction. If the junction were misclassified this way, the classical line labeling schemes would be worthless. In (b), we see two junction types taken from <ref> [Malik, 1985] </ref>, an extension of early line labeling work to cover the case of piecewise smooth curved objects. The two junction types are perceptually very similar, but place different constraints on the labels of the incoming edges. <p> Among the extensions being looked into are (a) marking occluding edges for directionality, which will require some minor modifications of the neighborhood graph structure for the MRF, and (b) using other junction catalogs, covering more than simply trihedral objects. In particular, the junction catalog of <ref> [Malik, 1985] </ref> has features that seem to require some of the abilities of this system, as we have seen. This would thus be an appropriate direction for extension.
