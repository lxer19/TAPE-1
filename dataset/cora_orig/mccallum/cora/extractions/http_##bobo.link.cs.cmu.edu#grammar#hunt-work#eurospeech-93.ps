Title: ABSTRACT  
Keyword: syntax, prosody, disambiguation  
Abstract: The syntactic and prosodic structures of spoken utterances are known to be related, although the relationship is difficult to define. This paper presents a novel method for modelling prosodic breaks from syntactic information obtained from an unconventional parser, the Link Parser. The model is used to score candidate syntactic structures based on prosodic breaks. The technique obtains 88% accuracy in selecting an appropriate syntactic parse using hand labels, which compares well with 84% for human subjects.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has looked at the modelling of prosodic phrasing with syntactic information from several perspectives; as a psycholinguistic model <ref> [1] </ref>, by modelling duration cues [2] and [3], for speech synthesis [4], and for a recognition model [5] and [6]. This paper presents a novel method for developing a model of the relationship between prosodic breaks and syntax, and using this model is used to perform syntactic disambiguation. <p> One advantage of this system over previous work relating prosody and syntax is that the predictive mechanism is relatively straight-forward and does not require some of the more complex processing of syntactic structures reported in <ref> [1] </ref>, [4] and [6]. This raises the question of whether the link parser is better suited to this type of work than syntax parsers which are based on hierarchical structures. This matter is the subject of ongoing research.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has looked at the modelling of prosodic phrasing with syntactic information from several perspectives; as a psycholinguistic model [1], by modelling duration cues [2] and <ref> [3] </ref>, for speech synthesis [4], and for a recognition model [5] and [6]. This paper presents a novel method for developing a model of the relationship between prosodic breaks and syntax, and using this model is used to perform syntactic disambiguation. <p> The model provides a probability score that syntactic and prosodic information correspond, and this score is used to rank candidate sentences and syntactic interpretations. The system is tested on a syntactic disambiguation task designed by Price et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> to determine human performance. The performance of the present system is compared with Prices results and those of a previous automatic system developed by Veilleux et. al. [6] and tested on the same task. <p> The break index is a measure of the strength of coupling of word pairs in an utterance, as defined in <ref> [3] </ref>. The break index is a seven level scale (0 to 6) which represents the perceived coupling (or separation) between each consecutive word pair in an utterance. <p> Only the first 5 stories recorded by a single female news reader are used in the current work. This set provides 100 sentences with an average of 19 words in each. The testing corpus is a set of ambiguous sentences, described in detail in <ref> [3] </ref>. It contains pairs of sentences with the same set of phones (and in many cases the same set of words) but different syntactic bracketing and thus different meaning. <p> Professional speakers have been reported to produce clearer and more consistent prosodic cues than non-professional speakers <ref> [3] </ref>. This makes the current task more tenable, but care must be taken in generalising the results to more casual speech. The differences in style between the two corpora must also be taken into account. <p> The link diagram with the highest probability of matching the marked break indices, according to equation 1, is chosen. A tied result is considered an error. Table 2 presents results for the different syntactic types. This is the same task as performed by humans listeners in <ref> [3] </ref> and by another recognition system reported in [6] - those results are included in Table 2 for comparison. The accuracy of the current work is higher than for human subjects, but this result is not statistically significant. The performance also exceeds the previous system with significance (p &lt; 0.05). <p> The poor result in this class is due to poor modelling of the link label, CL, that links clauses to verbs. No simple solution to this problem is evident at this stage. Price et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> found that human listeners could distinguish syntactic forms better than chance for only some of the classes; these are marked in Table 2 with an asterisk. The system recognises these classes with 95% accuracy (130 correct from 136 sentences).

The underlying assumption of this work is that there is a definable relationship between the syntactic links marked by the link parser and the prosodic coupling between words. <p> SYNTACTIC PROCESSING 2.1 The Link Parser The current work uses a novel syntactic parser, the link parser, developed by Sleator and Temperley <ref> [7] </ref>. The parser is based on the observation that for most sentences of most natural languages, if arcs (or links) are drawn to join words that relate to each other, those arcs do not cross. They call this phenomenon planarity. <p> A dictionary containing over 25,000 words, using around 80 link labels and defining a grammar covering most English syntactic forms is available and is used in this work. The use and meaning of the labels in the dictionary is described in some detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2 Extracting Syntactic Information The sentences from both speech corpora were parsed with the link parser. Certain difficulties were encountered in this process.
