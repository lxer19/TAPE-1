Abstract: This paper addresses some of the problems encountered in propagating high-speed signals through lossy transmission lines on the substrates of silicon-on-silicon thin-film multichip modules (MCM). Instead of terminated by resistors, the lossy lines on the thin-film multichip modules can be structured to critically damp out the signal resonances, they are thus called optimal, self-damped lossy transmission lines. It is easiest to manufacture interconnection lines with fixed metal and dielectric thicknesses, and vary only the line width. This results in specific dependency of line width on length for self-damped lines. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method of designing self-damped lossy transmission lines in a tree network for multichip module. We vary the width of each branch of the network to meet certain electrical damping criteria. This results in stable operation as long as the lossy transmission line is shorter than the quarter wave length of the highest frequency component of interests. The lengths of lines on the silicon-on-silicon thin-film MCM substrate usually does not exceed this limit. If certain designs require larger substrate or higher speed, the materials and structural properties of the substrate (for example the dielectric thickness) is changed according to the method.

Reference-contexts: By employing thin-film interconnect lines, the number of signal layers are reduced substantially (usually two signal layers with a power and a ground plane). The lines become lossy due to reduced dimensions, and behave differently from the comparatively lossless lines on a PC board <ref> [DKR + 90] </ref>. The interconnect lines on thin-film substrate usually have the ohmic resistance that is comparable to the characteristic impedance.

Reference-contexts: In addition, each termination dissipates quiescent power when the line is at non-zero voltage.

This paper addresses the above mentioned problems encountered in propagating high-speed signals through lossy transmission lines, which are found on the silicon-on-silicon thin-film multichip modules.

In the following section, we will first analyze the point-to-point lossy transmission-line interconnection that determines the minimum loss needed to obtain a stable yet fast signal propagation in unterminated lines. For any particular driver impedance, there is a maximum length for critically damped interconnect lines. <p> Here we assume the loss in the dielectrical layer is insignificant for typical multichip module substrates. Figure 4.1 shows the physical structure of a typical multichip module interconnections. In the following, we summarize the analysis performed by Fry and Tai for point-to-point connection <ref> [FT87] </ref>. Let V (z; t) represents the voltage on the interconnection line at point z distance from the driver at time t, and I (z; t) represents the current on the interconnection 4. <p> This equation describes only the combined effects of source termination and distributed line resistance damping but leaves out the load termination effect for point-to-point nets. To generalize the above analysis <ref> [FT87] </ref>, we take the finite load impedance into consideration. In reality, Z L is frequency dependent and imaginary, and for higher frequency, the assumption jZ L j jZ 0 j may not hold. Even so, this analytic formula in Equation 4. <p> The basic idea is to add enough losses to damp out the reflection and resonance, but not too much to degrade the rise time and propagation delay of the high speed signal. The analysis shows for the process parameters in the example that the maximum length is about 35cm <ref> [FT87] </ref>. The other limitation comes from the critical damping criteria for branches in multi-terminal net. This imposes a limitation on the maximum length of the line. This is not a limitation in propagating high speed signal, it is a limitation on the capability to critically damp the line.
