Reference-contexts: Let F be the set of stars of G with at least one and at most n edges. Then we have a star packing problem S n . This problem is one of the simplest generalizations of the matching problem that turns out to be "good" <ref> [1, 6, 10] </ref> (this also follows easily from the approach developed in this paper). The nature of most of the known "good" F (G)-packing problems are similar to that for the star packing problem. In this paper we consider a star packing problem with an additional condition.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of finding a maximum matching in a graph is well known. Many interesting results (that are classical now) concerning this problem have been found by Tutte, Edmonds, Berge, Gallai, Fulkerson, Lovasz and many others <ref> [14] </ref>. One of the ideas to generalize the matching theory is to try to replace the edges in a matching by some subgraphs of prescribed type. Let G be a graph, and F be a family of subgraphs of G. <p> It turns out that the following duality theorem holds. Theorem 2.1 Let n be a positive integer. Then minfjW [A]j : A 2 PIS n (G)g = maxfcr n (G n X) njXj : X V (G)g. 3 For n = 1 this is a well known result <ref> [14] </ref>. It is easy to see that the problem of finding an induced n-star packing which covers at least a given number of vertices in a graph belongs to the class N P . A natural question is whether this problem also belongs to CoN P . <p> Theorem 2.3 Let n 2. Then minfjW [A]j : A 2 PIS n (G)g = maxfoct (G n X) njXj : X V (G)g. This theorem is analogous to the Berge matching theorem <ref> [14] </ref>. &gt;From Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 it follows that the problem of finding an induced n-star packing that covers at least a given number of vertices in a graph belongs to CoN P . <p> The above Duality Theorem provides in particular a criterion for a graph to have a perfect induced n-packing which is analogous to the Tutte matching theorem <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> The next theorem is analogous to the Gallai-Edmonds Structure theorem on match-ings in a graph <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Theorem 2.9 An induced n-packing A of G covers the maximum number of vertices of G if and only if there is no augmenting A-trail in G. This theorem is similar to that for the matchings in a graph <ref> [14] </ref>. Let IS n (G) denote the set of vertex subsets X of G such that X can be covered by an induced n-packing of G. It is easy to see that IS n (G) has the hereditary property. <p> Note that MIS 1 (G) is the well-known matching matroid of G <ref> [14] </ref>. Theorem 2.10 can also be proved by using Structure Theorem 2.6. An edge subset A of G is called an k-induced n-packings if every component of G [A] having at least k + 1 edges is an induced subgraph of G. <p> This theorem also follows immediately from the simple fact that MS n (G) is the union of n matching matroids MS 1 (G). The same approach can be used to prove the following theorem on n-star packings analogous to the Gallai-Edmonds Structure theorem on matchings in a graph <ref> [14] </ref> and to Theorem 2.6 on induced n-star packings in a graph. <p> size, and (P 8) given non-negative weights of the vertices of G find an induced n-packing of G that covers a vertex set of G of maximum total weight. 3 Alternating and augmenting trails The concepts of alternating and augmenting paths play a very important role in the matching theory <ref> [14] </ref>. In 1971 we have introduced analogous concepts for a matroid which is the union of several matroids. We have considered special types of these paths (so called passive and active paths).

We consider undiracted graphs without loops or parallel edges. Let V (G) and E (G) denote the sets of vertices and edges of a graph G, respectively. Given an edge subset A of G let G [A] denote the subgraph of G induced by A, i.e. <p> MIS n (G) = (V (G); IS n (G)). We need some notions and notation from the matroid theory <ref> [15] </ref>: M is a matroid with the ground set E, C (M ) is the set of cyclic elements of M (i.e. the elements belonging to at least one circuit of M ), and L fl (M ) is the set of coloops (i.e. one element cocircuits) of M. <p> Given a base B (i.e. a maximal independent set) of M and an element e 2 E n B, let C (B; e) denote the circuit of M that is a subset of B [ e. It is known <ref> [15] </ref> and it is easy to prove that 6.7 Let M be a matroid.
