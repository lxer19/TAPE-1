Abstract: We present a general and, in the limit, exact approach to compute the time-domain response for finite-length RC lines under ramp input, by summing distinct diffusions starting at either end of the line. We also obtain analytical expressions for the finite time-domain voltage response for an open-ended finite RC line and for a finite RC line with capacitive load. Delay estimates using our new method are very close to SPICE-computed delays. Finally, we present a general recursive equation for computing the higher-order diffusion components due to reflections at the source and load ends. Future work extends our method to response computations in general interconnection trees by modeling both reflection and transmission coefficients at discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: Because of their highly resistive nature, interconnects are generally modeled as distributed RC lines. The analysis of finite RC transmission lines with step input is widely discussed in the literature, e.g., <ref> [20, 1, 19] </ref>. The standard approach is to first calculate the transfer function; then, by approximating the transfer function both transform-domain and time-domain responses are obtained for different configurations of the finite RC line with step input.

Reference-contexts: It is more reasonable to model the input signal from driver to interconnect as a finite ramp. Figure 1 shows the substantial difference in the response for step versus ramp input. Kaupp [9] analyzed RC interconnections under finite ramp input by assuming infinitely long transmission lines.

Recently, [17] proposed a methodology for RC interconnect synthesis under ramp input using the first few moments of the transfer function.
