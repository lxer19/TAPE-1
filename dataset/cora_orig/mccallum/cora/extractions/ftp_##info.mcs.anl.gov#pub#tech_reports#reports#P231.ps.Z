Title: Chapter 1 Automated Reasoning and Bledsoe's Dream for the Field 1  
Author: Larry Wos

Abstract: In one sense, this article is a personal tribute to Woody Bledsoe. As such, the style will in general be that of private correspondence. However, since this article is also a compendium of experiments with an automated reasoning program, researchers interested in automated reasoning, mathematics, and logic will find pertinent material here. The results of those experiments strongly suggest that research frequently benefits greatly from the use of an automated reasoning program. As evidence, I select from those results some proofs that are better than one can find in the literature, and focus on some theorems that, until now, had never been proved with an automated reasoning program, theorems that Hilbert, Church, and various logicians thought significant. To add spice to the article, I present challenges for reasoning programs, including questions that are still open.

Reference-contexts: In my opinion, the successes in combinatory logic provide the most powerful evidence that automated reasoning has made contributions of note. Barendregt <ref> [1] </ref> defines combinatory logic as an equational system satisfying the combinators S and K, where the respective actions of the constants S and K are given by the following two clauses. EQUAL (a (a (a (S,x),y),z),a (a (x,z),a (y,z))). EQUAL (a (a (K,x),y),x).

Reference-contexts: The history presented in this section will also permit others to see how far away those goals were|even a few years ago|how far we have come, and (to some extent) how we got where we are. The first problem (the Davis-Putnam example <ref> [2] </ref>) I identify with the field is, by today's standards, not very impressive.

Reference-contexts: An excellent example is provided (in Section 5) by the 4-step proof of thesis 59 from theses 19, 37, and 60 (the new axiom system). Dijkstra has commented on the importance of finding such short and elegant proofs <ref> [3] </ref>. In summary, to me|and I hope to you|the evidence presented in this article strongly suggests that automated reasoning has made significant quantitative and qualitative advances in the decade from 1980 to 1990.

Reference-contexts: In fact, except for the discovery by Guard and associates of SAM's lemma <ref> [4] </ref>, I was almost certain such contributions would not occur in my lifetime.

Reference-contexts: On that visit|and I checked this with Halmos|you and Halmos, using a theorem prover, were able to prove a theorem from Naive Set Theory <ref> [5] </ref>. Unfortunately, my best recollection says that the theorem occurs between pages 43 and 45; perhaps you can supply the needed details. I am not sure this early 1970s incident actually qualifies for "use of an automated reasoning program by a mathematician", but it is in the vicinity.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in addition to the challenges presented by the theorems discussed so far in this article, others seem in order, including questions that remain open here in 1990. Open Question in Robbins Algebra The following question has been open for decades, receiving attention even from Tarski and his students <ref> [6, 27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition, for every x, the negation of x exists with x plus its negation equal to 1 and x times its negation equal to 0. An alternative axiomatization of Boolean algebra consists of (R1), (R2), and Huntington's axiom (H3) <ref> [7] </ref>. (H3) EQUAL (o (n (o (n (x),y)),n (o (n (x),n (y)))),x). Since it is known that every finite Robbins algebra is Boolean, two choices exist.

Reference-contexts: Kalman is a logician at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In the late 1970s, he had his own theorem-proving program which he heavily used for his research in equivalential calculus <ref> [8] </ref>. Prompted by his desire to become familiar with our efforts in the field, Kalman visited Argonne and suggested leaving with us seven theorems to attempt to prove with our program. He did not have to wait too long before seeing results.

Reference-contexts: After tasting this finest of brandies, he was converted, shortly thereafter becoming a constant and active user of our programs| and still is today. So convinced of their value, he has written an extensive workbook for the use of ITP, a book that contains many gems that merit study <ref> [9] </ref>. He is currently using OTTER to aid his research in group theory, but in the context of divisional calculus. For some time, copies of OTTER have also been in the hands of Corrado Boehm (combinatory logic) University of Rome, Robert Meyer (relevance logic) Australian National University, R.

Reference-contexts: The theorems are from various logical calculi, such as sentential calculus.

I shall try hard to tell the truth about how the successes occurred, under what conditions, in what order, and how easily for my colleague McCune and me.

Reference-contexts: I am not sure this early 1970s incident actually qualifies for "use of an automated reasoning program by a mathematician", but it is in the vicinity. On the other hand, without doubt, Kalman's use at Argonne of the program ITP <ref> [12, 13] </ref> during his stay in the early 1980s clearly qualifies; Kalman was studying various aspects of equivalential calculus, in part in the context of group theory. Kalman continues to conduct research with the aid of a reasoning program; he is now using OTTER for additional studies in group theory.

Reference-contexts: beginning in 1978, automated reasoning programs designed 18 by members of the Argonne group have been used to answer various open questions, in finite semigroups posed by Kaplansky [29], in equivalential calculus posed by Kalman [35], in ternary Boolean algebra posed by Grau [30], in finite semigroups posed by McFadden <ref> [14] </ref>, and in combinatory logic posed by Smullyan [24, 25, 37]. In my opinion, the successes in combinatory logic provide the most powerful evidence that automated reasoning has made contributions of note.
