Abstract: An image warping method is presented that deforms an image continuously without foldover, while observing a given set of trajectories of feature elements. Any intermediate image during the morph is homeomorphic to the initial image and the morphing process is a homotopy. The method permits points, line-segments, and polygons to be included as features in the image. Our method is based on time-varying triangulation, that is, triangulation changes as features move. Accordingly, the deformation mapping is updated locally for the part for which the triangulation changes. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and complexity of the algorithm is analyzed.

Reference-contexts: The lengths of the line features may change as well as the angles between them. We assume that the features that are originally disjoint remain disjoint at all times and that all features are contained inside of a certain polygonally-bounded region D. For x 2 D and t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a morph function F : (D; t) ! D is to be constructed that satisfies: * F (p i ; t) = s i (t) for t in [0,1]. * F (x; t) is a homeomorphism from D to D for any t in [0,1]. * F (x; t) <p> To determine the mapping, a few factors are considered, including the distance to the nearest line-segment and the length of the nearest line-segment. This approach has lately been extended to 3D [12]. Methods based on scattered data interpolation are also used for image warping <ref> [1, 18] </ref>. In this approach, point features are incorporated to specify correspondence between source and target images. <p> Image warping may be considered as a function F (x; t), where x 2 D (D is a region in 2D) and t &gt; 0 is time (F (x; 0) is the initial image). Most image warping algorithms (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 8, 18] </ref>) take F (x; 0) and feature locations in the target image (at time, say, t 1 ) and produces F (x; t 1 ) (i.e., the target image) as output. To generate intermediate images, the same procedure is repeatedly applied by using intermediate feature locations. <p> In our method, points, lines, and polygons can all be used as features. For the case of polygon features, they can be nested. Some methods (e.g., ones using scattered data interpolation <ref> [1, 3, 18] </ref>) only permit point features, whereas only line features are used in the feature-based metamorphosis method [4]. This aspect provides further computational advantage over methods that permit point featues only. Our method is currently subject to some restrictions.

Reference-contexts: The second condition requires that the image is deformed without foldover and the third condition requires that no point in the picture jumps abruptly from one location to another during the morph sequence. The process as defined above is called isotopic deformation or rubber-band deformation <ref> [2] </ref>. Intuitively, the above conditions ensure a continuous foldover-free deformation, while satisfying the given trajectories. We approach the above problem by using triangulation of features in the domain.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, the problem is to establish a homeomorphism between two shapes. Parent [16] uses a divide-and-conquer approach for determining a homeomorphic mapping between the surfaces of two polyhedra with genus 0. Aronov et al <ref> [3] </ref> consider the problem of constructing a piecewise 3 linear homeomorphism between two simple polygons. Their method partition given polygons P and Q into smaller triangular cells such that the two triangulations for P and Q are compatible (i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between triangles). <p> If the morph fails to be one-to-one only for a small portion of the image, then composition of the entire mapping (encompassing the whole image) can potentially be expensive. In such a case, local composition may be used to save some computation.

Reference-contexts: In earlier work, point features organized in a rectilinear mesh [21] are used to define correspondence between two images. Beier and Nealy <ref> [4] </ref> propose a feature-based method which does not have this constraint. Their approach, which is based on line features as opposed to point features, is claimed to provide more intuitive control for human users. They first consider an affine map generated by a movement of a single line-segment. <p> Image warping may be considered as a function F (x; t), where x 2 D (D is a region in 2D) and t &gt; 0 is time (F (x; 0) is the initial image). Most image warping algorithms (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 8, 18] </ref>) take F (x; 0) and feature locations in the target image (at time, say, t 1 ) and produces F (x; t 1 ) (i.e., the target image) as output.

This aspect provides further computational advantage over methods that permit point featues only. Our method is currently subject to some restrictions. Features are not permitted to intersect with each other and all feature elements must be enclosed within a bounded area. This requires some care when generating their trajectories. <p> This requires some care when generating their trajectories. That is, if two edges intersect accidentally in the morph process, then our method fails to function. This is not the case for most other approaches including the feature-based metamorphosis method <ref> [4] </ref>. We have so far assumed that trajectories for feature elements are given. However, it can be tedious to enter all the trajectories manually. For this reason, an automated method for feature trajectory generation will be useful.

Reference-contexts: The simplest method for one-to-one mapping between two images would be to use triangulation for a given set of feature points. Using piecewise linear or cubic functions for interpolating triangular patches has been proposed for image registration <ref> [7] </ref>. These methods work best when two images admit the same triangulation, since otherwise the warped image can contain wrinkles. Flexible templates are used for image matching. Jain et al [9] use a parametric deformation method for pattern matching in image databases.

Reference-contexts: To make such triangulation possible, O (n 2 ) points are introduced to the interior of P and Q. They have shown that the complexity is worst-case optimal. Gupta and Wenger <ref> [8] </ref> propose an output-sensitive approach to the problem. Unlike the method of Aronov et al which always requires O (n 2 ) additional interior points to be added, the number of interior points to be added depends on the shapes of the given polygons in Gupta and Wenger's algorithm. <p> If the morph fails to be one-to-one only for a small portion of the image, then composition of the entire mapping (encompassing the whole image) can potentially be expensive.

Recently, Lee et al <ref> [11] </ref> have proposed multilevel free-form deformation (MFFD) for image warping that guarantees to satisfy point constraints while preserving one-to-one mapping between images. In this method, a hierarchy of multiple layers of lattice with various sizes is imposed on the image. <p> How small should each step be? To reduce the total amount of computation, it is desirable to use a large step. However, it is not clear how large should the step be for the mapping to be one-to-one. Lee et al <ref> [11] </ref> analyze a sufficient condition for their FFD-based algorithm. However, finding such a condition in general requires a careful analysis of each method being used. 2. Composition of functions can be expensive.

Reference-contexts: We need to use a certain data structure to retrieve triangle information in constant time. In particular, given an edge ij, we are to find the quadrilateral nimj that has ij as one of its diagonals. The winged edge data structure or quad-edge data structure <ref> [15] </ref> may be used to serve this purpose. <p> This choice has an advantage over other triangulations in that Delaunay triangulation tends to avoid flat triangles (it maximizes the smallest angle over all triangulations <ref> [15] </ref>). Example 1 (Kitty's wink). In this simple example, the kitty is made to wink. Yet, two existing methods (feature-based metamorphosis and thin-plate spline) do not produce satisfactory results. <p> For simplicity, we assume feature trajectories are linear for this analysis. An initial triangulation can be created in O (n log n) time <ref> [15] </ref>. It takes O (log n) time to find the next event [17]. On an event, updates on the data structure take O (1) time and it takes O (log n) to update the queue.

It takes O (log n) time to find the next event <ref> [17] </ref>. On an event, updates on the data structure take O (1) time and it takes O (log n) to update the queue. <p> In general, it is not bounded. For example, in the example of Fig. 7, the black dot can go around the white dot an arbitrary number of times. For some special cases, k can be bounded by a function of n. For example, Roos <ref> [17] </ref> has observed that Delaunay triangulation for a set of n points translating linearly changes its structure O (n p n) times in the average case.
