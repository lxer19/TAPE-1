Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the quality of surface interpolants is an important problem in computer graphics, computer aided geometric design and scientific visualization. Geometric uncertainty is a measure of interpolation error, level of confidence or quality of an interpolant that depends upon geometric characteristics of interpolants such as position, normals, isophotes, principal curvatures and directions, and mean and Gaussian curvatures. We present several new techniques for visualizing geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants, that combine the strengths of traditional techniques such as pseudo-coloring, differencing, overlay, and transparency with new glyph and texture-based techniques. The viewer can control an interactive query-driven toolbox to create a wide variety of graphics that allow probing of geometric information in useful and convenient ways. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by visualizing geometric uncertainty of surfaces obtained by different interpolation techniques bilinear, C 0 linear, C 2 bicubic B-spline, multiquadrics, inverse multiquadrics and thin plate splines.

Reference-contexts: Confidence level is the level of confidence that can be associated with data and can be computed based on statistical methods or evaluation by scientific judge-ment [TK93]. Data quality is a very broad term that encompasses many concepts including data validity and data lineage <ref> [BBC91] </ref>. Geometric uncertainty, likewise, is a scalar or a vector-valued function that captures error, accuracy, quality or confidence level of the geometry of a surface. The geometric characteristics of interest typically include several pieces of geometric information that are based on positional, first, second and sometimes even third derivative information. <p> Other techniques for visual comparisons include transparency, overlay and animation. Use of transparency for comparing surface interpolants is presented in [PFN94]. Related concepts of blends (including techniques based on percentage classification of materials), fuzziness, fog or blurs have been proposed in <ref> [FLN90, BBC91] </ref>. The idea of overlaying two curves or surfaces and connecting the respective points by straight lines or overlaying contour plots is also quite popular. Animation has been used to visualize fuzzy data [Ger92].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, in our visualizations, we have included many retinal or visual variables such as shape, size, and color based on Bertin's classification <ref> [Ber83] </ref>. We now discuss both these features in greater detail. 3.1 Visualization Techniques In order to capture diverse geometric information together, we have created visualizations based on geometry glyphs. Geometry glyphs are visual objects that convey geometry through its visual properties such as size, shape, color and position.

Reference-contexts: Line segment glyphs have been used in porcupine-type displays of surface normals. Glyphs have been used to represent univariate data [Tuk84, Tuf83]. Different types of glyphs such as stars, Chernoff faces, boxes, profiles, Kleiner-Hartigan tress and Andrew's plots have been used to represent multivariate data <ref> [CBB91] </ref>. Glyphs for representing vector and tensor fields are shown in [dLvW93]. Texture mapping has been used in scientific visualization [vW91]. Displacement mapping and bump mapping are also standard techniques in computer graphics.

Reference-contexts: Most of the geometric measures that capture second derivative information are based on minimum and maximum principal curvatures 1 and 2 and the associated principal directions ~e 1 and ~e 2 respectively. We refer the reader to any standard textbook on differential geometry for details <ref> [dC76] </ref>. Important geometric measures for surfaces are Gaussian curvature K = 1 2 and mean curvature H = 1 2 ( 1 + 2 ). Both Gaussian and mean curvatures are geometric invariants that capture the local geometry of the surface.

Reference-contexts: The exact choice depends upon the application at hand. 2.2 Visualizing Uncertainty Popular techniques for visually comparing surface interpolants are side-by-side comparisons, difference comparison and pseudo-coloring. Franke compared visual aspects of several interpolants by drawing wireframe perspective plots side-by-side <ref> [Fra82] </ref>. Isophotes have been compared by drawing the contours of isophote surfaces side-by-side [HHS + 92]. Difference comparison is a technique where the difference between two images, surfaces or volumes is computed point-by-point and the difference image, surface or volume is rendered. <p> We have also implemented Hardy's multiquadrics, inverse multiquadrics, and thin plate splines. The motivation for choosing these radial interpolants is that these three radial interpolants are the only ones (besides one more radial inter-polant) that received an `A' rating in visual category in Franke's survey <ref> [Fra82] </ref>. 4.2 Examples and Data Sets We have experimented with Franke's six analytic test functions [Fra82], which include a wide variety of shapes including hills, valleys, cliffs, saddles and a part of a sphere.
