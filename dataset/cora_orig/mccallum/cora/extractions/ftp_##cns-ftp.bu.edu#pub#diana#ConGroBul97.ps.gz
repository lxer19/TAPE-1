Dynamics formulation of two DOF planar arm Some simulations of the model incorporate equations <ref> (Asada and Slotine, 1986) </ref> for a two degree-of-freedom planar arm (Figure 3) that were based on parameters of the human arm.

Reference-contexts: Brainstem and spinal cord circuitry apparently provide some basis for task-specific recruitment and control of muscle synergies, and experimental studies of decerebrate/decerebellate animals have produced evidence suggesting that such circuitry has some of the same associative competence widely attributed to the cerebellum <ref> (Bloedel and Bracha, 1995) </ref>. Though suggestive of partial redundancy, such studies have not shown that the brainstem/spinal circuitry affords a large, content-addressable memory for learning and storage of the relatively arbitrary task contexts and action groupings required for a large repertoire of learned skills.

Reference-contexts: is prevented by Purkinje inhibition of NIP unless PF-signaled contexts from the CPG and spino-muscular system have reliably led to teaching signals from the olive that have induced PF-Purkinje LTD and thereby transiently reduce Purkinje inhibition of the NIP, as has been demonstrated for the analogous case of eye-blink conditioning <ref> (reviewed in Bullock, Fiala, and Grossberg, 1994) </ref>. The right side of the diagram shows that one proposed teaching signal derives from feedback from muscle spindle organs. <p> An earlier report <ref> (Bullock, Fiala, Grossberg, 1994) </ref> showed that such specificity could be learned in NIP because climbing fibers (and the teaching signals that they carry) project both to a limited cortical microzone and to the deep nuclear cells that receive inhibition from that region of cerebellar cortex.

Reference-contexts: The Figure 1 system is shown in greater detail in Figure 2. As the kinematic central pattern generator (CPG), we chose the VITE model <ref> (Bullock and Grossberg, 1988) </ref>, which embodies key properties of the voluntary, and largely cortical, arm trajectory generation network that outputs to lower brain centers through area 4 (Bullock, Cisek, and Grossberg, 1997). The VITE CPG generates desired position and desired velocity commands. <p> On the other hand, Tables 1 and 2 summarize neurobiological evidence for each one of the processing stages of the VITE and FLETE models. Central pattern generator: VITE model The VITE circuit <ref> (Bullock and Grossberg, 1988) </ref> is a multi-channel central pattern generator capable of generating desired arm movement trajectories by smoothly interpolating between initial and final length commands for the synergetic muscles that contribute to a prescribed multijoint movement. <p> By equation (3), the PPV integrates the product of opponent GO times DV signals. These equations treat a case where there are are no cerebellar inputs to the CPG, but this need not always be the case. Prior studies <ref> (Bullock and Grossberg, 1988, 1991) </ref> have demonstrated that the VITE equations can be used to explain a large number of robust kinematic features of voluntary point-to-point movements including smooth, bell-shaped velocity profiles, voluntary speed April 8, 1997 9 control that leaves direction and amplitude nearly invariant, peak velocity and acceleration as

For example, elbow and wrist joint receptors discharge primarily near to the end of the joint range (Millar, 1975; Tracey, 1979); but those in the hip signal over a large fraction of the working range of this joint (Carli et al., 1979).

In addition, there are articular receptors that do not distinguish between joint flexion or extension, whereas others show responses over roughly half of the joint's range.

Reference-contexts: Each muscle-related channel i of this network, indicated by a site O i in Figure 2, was composed of two model neurons: an excitatory projection neuron with activity t i and an inhibitory interneuron with activity u i <ref> (Ellias and Grossberg, 1975) </ref>. The olivary projection neuron is inhibited by the interneuron and excited by spindle error feedback signals from the associated muscle. The olivary interneuron is excited by, and slowly tracks the activation level of, the projection neuron.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, accuracy can not be guaranteed unless motor commands to entire groups of muscles can be accurately timed and scaled prior to the arrival of feedback. Such considerations, in combination with observations regarding the cerebellum's typical "side-loop" embedding <ref> (Ito, 1984 and Figure 1) </ref> within the sensory-motor system, support a view of the cerebellum as an adaptive controller capable of calibrating parallel feedforward motor commands that can substitute for slow feedback-based commands and thereby enable high speed and accuracy without iterations (Grossberg and Kuperstein, 1986). <p> Because of the opponent form of the model, these learning results also reveal that muscle opponency imposes no constraints on prewiring at the level of the cerebellar cortex other than the constraint that CFs carrying signals of errors from opponent muscle channels should project to distinct parasaggital microzones <ref> (Ito, 1984) </ref>. <p> The joint velocity _ fi trace shows that the system is able to dynamically track the desired joint velocity _ fi d .

Reference-contexts: pattern was more reminiscent of the multi-phasic burst pattern that is observed at the level of the EMG during rapid joint rotations, in which a large braking burst in the antagonist becomes necessary to prevent limb inertia from causing a large overshoot relative to the intended endpoint of the movement <ref> (Lestienne, 1979) </ref>. The emergence of a braking burst in the model RN is not surprising since the role of the cerebellum in the current model is to help generate the torques needed to achieve the desired velocity and position.

Reference-contexts: The third aspect of our results concerns learning. The model includes a local circuit for signal processing by the olivary nucleus. Its inclusion allowed a demonstration that there is no incompatibility between data indicating that the olive is inherently oscillatory <ref> (Llinas, 1989) </ref> and the hypothesis that the olive's output via climbing fibers constitutes a discrete error-feedback driven teaching signal. The results also show that the climbing fiber signals produced by the olivary model are suitable for regulating incremental weight adjustments in the cerebellar cortex. <p> It also delimits the time during which the teaching signal acts in cerebellar cortex, which is needed for precise adaptive timing. However, use of recurrent feedback from the slow inhibitory interneuron also makes the olive inherently oscillatory. In the present context, this experimentally observed property <ref> (Llinas, 1989) </ref> is treated as a side effect rather than as a key functional property. Dynamics formulation of two DOF planar arm Some simulations of the model incorporate equations (Asada and Slotine, 1986) for a two degree-of-freedom planar arm (Figure 3) that were based on parameters of the human arm.
