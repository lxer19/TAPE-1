Abstract: Technologies applicable toward a display system in which a laser is raster scanned on the viewer's retina are reviewed. The properties of laser beam propagation and the inherent resolution of a laser scanning system are discussed. Scanning techniques employing rotating mirrors, galvonometer scanners, acousto-optic deflectors, and piezo-electric deflectors are described. Resolution, speed, deflection range, and physical size are strongly coupled properties of these technologies. For head-mounted display applications, a monochromatic system employing a laser diode source with acousto-optic and galvonometer scanners is deemed most practical. A resolution of 1000 x 1000 pixels at 60 frames per second should be possible with such a sytem. A radiometric analysis indicates that eye safety would not be a problem in a retina-scanning system.
