Abstract: We present conditions, some necessary and some sufficient, valid under weak assumptions, for robust stability and uniform robust stability of uncertain linear time-invariant systems with linear time-invariant uncertainties that are block-diagonal, with known frequency-dependent norm bounds on the diagonal blocks. Small- theorems with frequency-independent uncertainty bounds are recovered as special cases.

Reference-contexts: Often, the uncertainty is assumed to possess various additional properties. Common examples are that is structured (i.e., diagonal or block-diagonal), that it is linear time-invariant or real-constant etc. Such control system models have found wide acceptance in robust control; see for example <ref> [D, S, PD, L, ZDG] </ref>. We will henceforth refer to the system in Figure 1 as the P interconnection, and denote it by I (P; ). The Small- Theorem is the foundation of the structured singular value approach towards assessing the stability of systems affected by structured uncertainties.

Reference-contexts: Consider the closed path (circle) fl : [; ) ! D given by fl () = e j . Since g is analytic and bounded in int (D ) and has no zero in the range of fl, it follows from Cauchy's Principle of the Argument (see, e.g. <ref> [R, Theorem 10.43] </ref>) that the origin has a nonzero index with respect to the compound map g ffi fl (i.e., g ffi fl "encircles" the origin at least once).

Reference-contexts: Various versions of the small- theorem exist in the literature, and it was shown in <ref> [TF] </ref> that some commonly quoted versions of this theorem are in fact incorrect. The situation is even less clear when the norm-bound on is frequency-dependent. To the authors' knowledge, no formal extension of the small- theorem to this case is available in the open literature. <p> describing the interconnection have a unique solution. 5 When W (z) = I n for all z 2 D c , the situation considered here is the standard complex--problem, and a number of precise mathematical statements have been made relating robust stability, uniform robust stability and in this case; see <ref> [TF] </ref> for example. For general W , however, no such statements can be found in the literature. The objective of this paper is to explore this issue. <p> 1: Moreover, if condition (12) does not hold, then I (P; ) is unstable for some ~ 2 B. 3 However, I (P; B W R) can still be robustly stable, even when P is real-rational, and even when W (z) = I for all z 2 @D : see <ref> [TF] </ref>. 4 In particular, this result is alluded to at the end of [TF]. <p> unstable for some ~ 2 B. 3 However, I (P; B W R) can still be robustly stable, even when P is real-rational, and even when W (z) = I for all z 2 @D : see <ref> [TF] </ref>. 4 In particular, this result is alluded to at the end of [TF]. <p> : : : ; S I s S ; 0 1 ; : : : ; 0 with ( 0 ) = () and rank ( 0 i ) 1, such that det (I + 0 M ) = 0: 6 A proof of this result can be found in <ref> [TF] </ref>, embedded in the proof of Theorem 1. <p> To complete the proof we construct a family f * : * 2 (0; maxf ^ ; ^ g)g in the appropriate ball (B W , B W R, B W RR) such that 7 This result is standard.

This is not so in the general case however. A counterexample (see <ref> [TF] </ref>) is given by P (z) = 1 (z + 1)=z # with R = 1 and r 1 = 2 ("repeated-real"). For such a structure (P (z)) is the spectral radius of P (z) if P (z) has a real eigenvalue, and 0 otherwise. <p> Thus suppose that, for some ^z 2 @D , Then there exists ^ 2 , with ( ^ ) &lt; 1, such that det (I + ^ W (^z)P (^z)) = 0: 9 For the special case of frequency-independent uncertainty bound, this result was obtained in <ref> [TF] </ref> (in the continuous-time case). 20 It remains to construct 2 B W (respectively, B W R, B W RR) such that (^z) = ^ W (^z).
