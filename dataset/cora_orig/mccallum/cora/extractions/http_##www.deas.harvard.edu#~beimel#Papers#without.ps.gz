Abstract: All known constructions of information theoretic t-out-of-n secret sharing schemes require secure, private communication channels among the parties for the reconstruction of the secret. In this work we investigate the cost of performing the reconstruction over public communication channels. A naive implementation of this task distributes 2n 2 one times pads to each party. This results in shares whose size is 2n 1 times the secret size. We present three implementations of such schemes that are substantially more efficient: * A scheme enabling multiple reconstructions of the secret by different subsets of parties, with factor O(n=t) increase in the shares' size. * A one-time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction of the secret, with O(log(n=t)) increase in the shares' size. * A one-time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction by a set of size exactly t, with factor O(1) increase in the shares' size. We prove that the first implementation is optimal (up to constant factors) by showing a tight (n=t) lower bound for the increase in the shares' size.

Reference-contexts: The security should hold for any coalition of at most t 1 parties. A special case is B = ;, namely a listener who overhears all communications but has no shares should gain no partial information about the secret. Shamir <ref> [2] </ref> presented a traditional secret sharing scheme in which the size of the shares is the same as the size of the secrets (for domains of secrets which contain at least n + 1 secrets). <p> We first describe a simple scheme in which the size of the shares is 2n 1 times the size of the secret. Our O (n=t) construction can be viewed as an optimization of this simple scheme. In this scheme, the dealer shares the secret using Shamir's secret sharing scheme <ref> [2] </ref>. The dealer also deals to every pair of parties two random strings whose size is the same as the size of the secret. These two random strings, which we call keys, are given to the two parties of the pair, and will be used as one-time pads.

Reference-contexts: Schemes which satisfy this requirement on secure, private channels were presented by Blakley and Meadows [22] (see also <ref> [3] </ref>, [4] and [23]), and are called ramp schemes. We use ramp schemes instead of regular secret sharing schemes to design our building boxes.

Reference-contexts: The size of shares in Shamir's scheme is the smallest possible, since the size of the share has to be at least as large as the size of the secrets <ref> [4] </ref>. In traditional secret sharing schemes, while one set reconstructs the secret, no information is leaked to disjoint coalitions (due to the security of the channels). Hence, secure traditional schemes are always unrestricted. <p> Thus, the size of each share has to be at least the size of the secret <ref> [4] </ref>. Therefore, our scheme is tight up to a constant factor. <p> Schemes which satisfy this requirement on secure, private channels were presented by Blakley and Meadows [22] (see also [3], <ref> [4] </ref> and [23]), and are called ramp schemes. We use ramp schemes instead of regular secret sharing schemes to design our building boxes. Assume that sets of ` parties should be able to reconstruct the secret, while sets of fewer than t parties should get no information about the secret.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not necessarily possible to "distribute" the secret to members of a superset without leaking information to other parties. C. Key Distribution Schemes We now define unrestricted, non-communicating key distribution schemes. (Other variations of key distribution schemes can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>, [11].) These key distribution schemes are used in the constructions of our secret sharing schemes. Definition 3: Let b be a positive integer such that b n 2, and let K be a set of keys. <p> Blom [21] constructed efficient (2; b)-key distribution schemes. For every prime-power q (where q n) he presented a scheme in which the keys are taken from GF (q) and the shares are taken from GF (q) b+1 . Blundo et. al. <ref> [10] </ref> proved that this is optimal, namely the shares cannot be taken from smaller domains. III. Unrestricted Schemes In this section we construct unrestricted secret sharing schemes with public reconstruction, in which the size of the share of every party is O (n=t) times the size of the secret.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not necessarily possible to "distribute" the secret to members of a superset without leaking information to other parties. C. Key Distribution Schemes We now define unrestricted, non-communicating key distribution schemes. (Other variations of key distribution schemes can be found in [10], <ref> [11] </ref>.) These key distribution schemes are used in the constructions of our secret sharing schemes. Definition 3: Let b be a positive integer such that b n 2, and let K be a set of keys. <p> Consider a (2; 2t 3) key distribution scheme, a coalition B of t 1 parties, and a disjoint set G of t parties. From the point of view of the coalition, the 2 keys of pairs of parties in G are distributed uniformly and independently (for a proof see <ref> [11] </ref>). Blom [21] constructed efficient (2; b)-key distribution schemes. For every prime-power q (where q n) he presented a scheme in which the keys are taken from GF (q) and the shares are taken from GF (q) b+1 . <p> In the previous scheme, during the reconstruction for this set, only the keys that were given to P i 0 were used. To improve the space efficiency we will use all the keys of the parties in the reconstructing set. Following <ref> [11] </ref>, we partition the secret into t sub-secrets, and share each sub-secret using Shamir's scheme. Now we choose t parties of the reconstructing set, and each one will be responsible for reconstructing one sub-secret. Each party will act as the leader in the previous scheme. <p> We can slightly improve this lower bound, by observing that every one-time exactly t-out-of-n secret sharing scheme with public reconstruction can be used as a one-time communicating (t; t 1) key distribution scheme (for t n=2) (for definition of communicating key distribution scheme see <ref> [11] </ref>). The size of the share in every (t; t 1) key distribution scheme is at least twice the size of the key [11]. Therefore, the size of the share in every one-time secret sharing scheme with public reconstruction is at least twice the size of the secret. <p> with public reconstruction can be used as a one-time communicating (t; t 1) key distribution scheme (for t n=2) (for definition of communicating key distribution scheme see <ref> [11] </ref>). The size of the share in every (t; t 1) key distribution scheme is at least twice the size of the key [11]. Therefore, the size of the share in every one-time secret sharing scheme with public reconstruction is at least twice the size of the secret. In Fig. 3 we describe the one time scheme in which every set of at least t parties can securely reconstruct the secret.

Reference-contexts: From the point of view of the coalition, the 2 keys of pairs of parties in G are distributed uniformly and independently (for a proof see [11]). Blom <ref> [21] </ref> constructed efficient (2; b)-key distribution schemes. For every prime-power q (where q n) he presented a scheme in which the keys are taken from GF (q) and the shares are taken from GF (q) b+1 . <p> In this case, total independence among the keys is not needed, and weaker independence requirements suffice. Shares can therefore be taken from a smaller sample space, which translates into smaller size shares. Specifically, we use Blom's key distribution scheme <ref> [21] </ref> for this purpose. The first scheme we present enables one-time reconstruction of the secret by sets of size exactly t. The size of the shares is a constant (less than 10) times the size of the secret, namely only O (1) increase in shares' size.

Reference-contexts: This building block is a scheme in which exactly 2 i t parties can reconstruct the secret, while any coalition of size t 1 does not gain any information on the reconstructed secret.

Reference-contexts: The size of the shares in this scheme is n times the size of the secret. During the reconstruction in this scheme every party is deterministic and sends only one message that depends only on its share. In a general secret sharing scheme, first suggested by <ref> [24] </ref>, we are given a collection A of sets of parties called an access structure. We require that every set in A can reconstruct the secret, while every set not in A does not jointly know anything about the secret. <p> Secret sharing schemes satisfying these requirements can exist only for monotone collections. Indeed, it is known that for every monotone collection there exists a traditional secret-sharing scheme <ref> [24] </ref>- [26]. However, the size of the shares in these schemes is typically exponential in the number of parties (i.e., of size m2 fi (n) where n is the number of parties in the system and m is the size of the secret). Let A be any monotone access structure.

Reference-contexts: Then, we show that this lower bounds translates into an (n=t) increase for t-out-of-n schemes. We start with the lower bound for t = 2. The proof uses entropy and mutual information. For definitions of these information theoretic terms, the reader can refer to <ref> [27] </ref>. We assume an arbitrary probability distribution on the secrets, and we denote the secret by the random variable S.
