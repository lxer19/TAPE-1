Title: An Approach for Parallelizing any General Unsymmetric Sparse Matrix Algorithm  
Author: Tariq Rashid Timothy A. Davis 
Abstract: Technical Report TR-94-036, Computer and Information Sciences Department, University of Florida, 1994. Presented at the 7th SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing, February 1995, San Francisco, CA. Abstract In many large scale scientific and engineering computations, the solution to a sparse linear system is required. We present a partial unsymmetric nested dissection method that can be used to parallelize any general unsymmetric sparse matrix algorithm whose pivot search can be restricted to a subset of rows and columns in the active submatrix. The submatrix is determined by the partial unsymmetric dissection. We present results of this approach, applied to the unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method.

Reference-contexts: Partitioning is one of the key ideas for generating efficient orderings for sparse matrix calculations. Since finding an optimal partition of a graph is known to be NP-complete <ref> [7] </ref>, the nature of the problem has inspired a variety of heuristics. Consider the undirected bipartite graph of the matrix A, with 2n nodes (n row nodes and n column nodes).

Reference-contexts: This happens, for example, when the initial degrees of all the nodes are equal. The balance can be improved by breaking ties depending on how many rows and columns are currently in the separator. 3.2 Method 2 In this approach we maintain symmetry similar to <ref> [8] </ref>. If the pseudoperipheral node is row r i (column c i ), we also consider column c i (row r i ) as a pseudoperipheral node and generate level structures starting from both the nodes (L 0 contains both nodes).

Reference-contexts: However, the sizes of the submatries, A 11 and A 22 , should not be too small. This is why we call our approach "partial" nested dissection. Fig. 1.
