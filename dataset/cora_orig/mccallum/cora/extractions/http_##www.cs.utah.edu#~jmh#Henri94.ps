Abstract: An analytical and experimental investigation of a jet pipe controlled electropneumatic servoactuator designed for use in the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand (UMDH) has been performed. An accurate dynamic model has been developed and verified which includes detailed representation of the jet pipe element, orifice areas and fluid flows. The effects and modelling of hysteresis in the jet pipe are discussed. Theoretical and experimental results are presented for closed-loop force control showing that the force bandwidth can be raised as high as 80 Hz.

Reference-contexts: Most of the early work involved the study of two-stage, four-way spool valves, with pneumatic or hydraulic examples being found in most fluid power textbooks <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Traditionally, linear transfer functions were used to model pneumatic systems about the mid-stroke operating point [4, 12]. More recently, Liu et al. [10] used a state-space method to produce a linearized model valid for several operating points. <p> See [6] for the equations describing the orifice areas. 2.4 Flow Equations Assuming the flow processes are adiabatic, the mass flow rates through the orifices are governed by the following set of equations <ref> [1, 2, 12, 14] </ref>: _m = &lt; C d A P u p P u r c T u C 2 f 2 for P d (5) P u cr fl + 1 fl1 C 1 = u t fl fl + 1 fl1 C 2 = 2fl (8) v u <p> The actuator is designed to be slightly "leaky" allowing a small flow between the chambers past the position. This leakage area is ring shaped and is very long relative to its opening width indicating that the discharge coefficient should be a function of pressure ratio <ref> [1] </ref>, instead of a constant as is the case with the other orifices. Therefore, the discharge coefficient for the leakage past the piston area, A lpp , is C d;lpp = C dm P d where C dm and C db are constants.

Reference-contexts: To date, little work has been done on jet pipe valve controlled actuators. McLain et al. [11] developed a very detailed dynamic model for a hydraulic version of the actuator studied in this paper. A similar study was performed by Boulet et al. <ref> [3] </ref> with linearized valve and fluid dynamics for a different hydraulic actuator. Both these groups included a static hysteresis model based on a method described in [5] although they did not include results on the effectiveness of the hysteresis model in predicting minor loops. <p> Furthermore, there was found to be a significant amount of hysteresis in the static position versus current relationship. Several investigators <ref> [3, 11] </ref> have included a hysteresis model based on a method described in [5], however this method was found to be ineffective and was therefore not used. This issue is discussed in greater detail later in this paper.

This method allegedly predicts minor loop trajectories based on the major loop and previous reversal points. The effectiveness of several different amplitude currents. this method was examined by collecting several minor loops for the jet pipe and comparing them with the simulated hysteresis model trajectories.

Reference-contexts: The spring has a low spring constant and hence the piston contacts the rod stopper for all but extremely low actuator forces. Friction between the graphite piston and glass cylinder is known to small <ref> [9] </ref> and is further reduced by the lubricating effect of the air flow past the piston. Friction between the rod and cylinder seal is assumed insignificant as well, meaning that stiction and kinetic friction are neglected entirely.
