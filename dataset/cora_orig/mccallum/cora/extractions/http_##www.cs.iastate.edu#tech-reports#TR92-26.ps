Reference-contexts: This section describes the configurations used in the experiments described in chapters 5 through 7 of reference <ref> [2] </ref>. The output from each of the experiments includes the configuration data for the simulator used during that experiment. However, there are only two basic configurations that were used for these experiments, so duplicating this data for each test case would result in hundreds of pages of redundant information. <p> StopGCCost: 20, FlipOverheadCost: 20, BeginScanCost: 10 CopyObjectOverheadCost: 20, CopySmallDataOverheadCost: 32 ScanObjectOverheadCost: 20, ScanDataSliceOverheadCost: 32 MakeControlBlockOverheadCost: 20, MakeControlBlockIncCost: 12 DoControlBlockOverheadCost: 20, DoControlBlockIncCost: 12 MakeSmallDataRegionOverhead: 20 3 Raw Test Results for Chapter 5 Experiments This appendix contains the raw empirical data produced by the simulation experiments described in chapter 5 of reference <ref> [2] </ref>. Each test case is given a four- or five-part name. The first part is "gc" if the garbage-collected memory architecture was simulated, or "nogc" if the standard architecture was used.
