Abstract: We present a qualitative model for reasoning about perceptions, sensors, and belief, and a logic to reason about this model. Basic to our model is a distinction between precision and accuracy, for both of which we provide qualitative definitions. In our logic this distinction gives rise to two modal operators|P for actual perception, and C p for perceptual capability, which is captured as a set of possible percepts. Adding to these operators the standard B operator to model belief, we end up with a logic combining standard Kripke-style semantics with the almost-standard `neighborhood semantics.' We define various agent types in the logic, from agents who believe all and only what the sensors tell them, to much more skeptical agents. We define each agent both axiomatically and model-theoretically, and provide soundness and completeness results relat ing the two types of definitions.

Reference-contexts: Thus P uses the standard semantics for necessity operators in modal logic, whereas C p uses a variant of neighborhood (or minimal model) semantics <ref> [ Chellas, 1980 ] </ref> . For s 2 S, we use the notation N (s) = fX S j (s; X) 2 N g, and I (s) = ft 2 S j (s; t) 2 Ig.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A great deal of attention in AI has been devoted to modeling states of information, whether qualitatively through, e.g., logics of knowledge and belief (cf. <ref> [ Moore, 1985; Konolige, 1986; Fagin et al., 1995 ] </ref> ), or quantitatively. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to modeling information sources, on the basis of which the various information states are reached.

Davis' logic contains only notions analogous to our P and B, and does not have a way of specifying the perceptual capabilities of the sensor.
