Abstract: While the picture of approximation complexity class becomes clear for most combinatorial optimization problems, it remains an open question whether Feedback Vertex Set can be approximated within a constant ratio in directed graph case. In this paper we present an approximation algorithm with performance bound L max 1, where L max is the largest length of essential cycles in the graph G(V; E). The worst case bound is b jV j 2 jV j jEj + 1c which, in general, is inferior to Seymour's recent result [14], but becomes a small constant for some graphs. Furthermore, we prove the so-called pseudo *-approximate property, i.e. FVS can be divided into a class of disjoint N P complete subproblems, and our heuristic becomes *-approximate for each one of these subproblems.

Reference-contexts: On the undirected graph side, approximating FVS can be approximated within some constant ratio. Bar-Yehuda et. al. [20] obtained a ratio of 4 for the unweighted case and a ratio of minf4 log n; 2ffi 2 weighted case, and recently Bafna, Berman and Fujito <ref> [1] </ref> improved this ratio to 2 and showed that the ratio cannot be improved unless Vertex Cover Problem can be approximated with a ratio better than 2. On the other hand, pictures are not as clear for the directed graph case.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the bound of row-sum heuristics, due to Hochbaum [6], Yehuda and Even [19], Balas <ref> [2] </ref> et. al. , is r max which is inferior in general, but becomes a small constant in some cases, where r max is the largest number of nonzeroes in each row. <p> One approach is first proposed by Johnson [8] then studied by Chvatal [4] et. al. which achieves a bound of log (d) where d is the maximum number of nonzeroes in one column.

Reference-contexts: There are two types of approximation algorithms for SC, one is called the column-sum heuristic and the other the row-sum heuristic.

Reference-contexts: Take the well known Set Covering Problem as an example. There are two types of approximation algorithms for SC, one is called the column-sum heuristic and the other the row-sum heuristic.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 Algorithm H1 returns in polynomial time a solution with error bound b jV j 2 jV j jEj + 1c. The worst case bound in Theorem 1 can be improved by incorporating other heuristics. If we apply Levy-Lowe contraction algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> in each iteration of our algorithm, then the algorithm will always return a solution with nontrivial bound (but the bound is too poor and loses the advantage of the heuristic). Algorithm H2 1. Input G (V; E); S = ;; k = 0; 2. <p> Also we show that a problem that properly contains FVS is not *-approximable. However, the question of whether there is an *-approximate algorithm to FVS is still open. Also the questions of whether there are nice analytical bounds for some heuristics that perform well in practice like Levy-Lowe algorithm <ref> [11] </ref>, et. al. are also of interest.

Using recent results <ref> [12] </ref> from computer science on the approximation of set covering, we show that a problem that properly contains FVS is not *-approximable. Also we characterize the condition under which Set Covering can be transformed to FVS. <p> Lemma 1 PFVS is N P complete. Lund and Yannakakis <ref> [12] </ref> proved that there is no polynomial approximation algorithm for set covering within a bound c log 2 k for any c &lt; 1=4 unless P =N P , where k is the largest column sum. <p> Furthermore, each row in the constraint matrix of SC corresponds to a cycle in G, therefore the SC instance is equivalent to a PFVS. If there is an *-approximate algorithm for PFVS, there will also be an *-approximate algorithm for SC, which by <ref> [12] </ref> is a contradiction. 9 Proof of Lemma 7: Let K 0 denote the total number of iterations, C k denote the essential cycle found at it eration k, S H denote the set returned by algorithm H1, S fl denote the optimal feedback vertex set.
