Abstract: This paper provides new combinatorial bounds and characterizations of authentication codes (A-codes) and key predistribution schemes (KPS). We first prove a new lower bound on the number of keys in an A-code without secrecy, which can be thought of as a generalization of the classical Rao bound for orthogonal arrays. We also prove a new lower bound on the number of keys in a general A-code, which is based on the Petrenjuk, Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson bound for t-designs. We also present new lower bounds on the size of keys and the amount of users' secret information in KPS, the latter of which is accomplished by showing that a certain A-code is "hiding" inside any KPS.

Reference-contexts: This bound follows from a link between A-codes without secrecy and KPS. We are indebted to Amos Beimel <ref> [1] </ref> for providing us with the following lemma, which improves a weaker result we had proved earlier. Lemma 4.2 ([1]) If there exists a (g; t) KPS with key set K for a set U of n users, then there exists a t-fold secure A-code without secrecy, (S; A; E; P

Reference-contexts: In this section, we generalize Proposition 2.3 to any t by extending the technique of <ref> [10, 2] </ref>.

Let 4 Then, from Lemma 2.4, the vectors in Z 0 are mutually orthogonal, and hence they are linearly independent. Therefore, jEj = dim V jZ 0 j. Now suppose that we have equality in Eq. (4).

In a (g; t) key predistribution scheme, each user i is given some secret information u i 2 U i by a trusted authority.

A (2; t) KPS was first described by Blom <ref> [3] </ref>. A (g; t) KPS for any t 2 was presented by Blundo et al [4]. We will assume throughout this section that K P = K for any P , and k P is uniformly distrubuted over K.

Reference-contexts: This bound is a generalization of the classical Rao bound <ref> [5, p. 180] </ref> for orthogonal arrays. Also, equality can be attained if and only if E is uniformly distributed and the authentication matrix is an orthogonal array with strength t + 1. Next, we consider a new scenario for authentication. <p> It is in fact a generalization of the Petrenjuk, Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson bound for t-designs [6], which in turn is an extension of Fisher's inequality <ref> [5, p. 3] </ref> for balanced incomplete block designs.

In a (g; t) key predistribution scheme, each user i is given some secret information u i 2 U i by a trusted authority. <p> For t &gt; 2, we have only one example in which equality occurs, obtained by applying the construction mentioned at the end of Section 3.2 in the case of a 4-(23; 7; 1) design, which is the derived design of the 5-(24; 8; 1) Witt design (see <ref> [5, p. 72] </ref>). 4 New bounds for key predistribution schemes 4.1 The model for KPS A (g; t) key predistribution scheme (or KPS) consists of a trusted authority (or TA) and a set of users U = f1; 2; ; ng. <p> This argument holds for any t + 1 columns. Hence L is an orthogonal array OA 1 (t + 1; n 1; jKj). Then, applying the classical Bose-Bush and Bush bounds for orthogonal arrays of index one (see <ref> [5, p. 172] </ref> and [5, p. 180]) to L, we obtain the desired bound. Hence, if jKj &gt; t + 1 in Theorem 4.1 (which is usually the case), then jKj nt1. In the construction of Blom's (2; t) KPS, jKj n1. <p> This argument holds for any t + 1 columns. Hence L is an orthogonal array OA 1 (t + 1; n 1; jKj). Then, applying the classical Bose-Bush and Bush bounds for orthogonal arrays of index one (see [5, p. 172] and <ref> [5, p. 180] </ref>) to L, we obtain the desired bound. Hence, if jKj &gt; t + 1 in Theorem 4.1 (which is usually the case), then jKj nt1. In the construction of Blom's (2; t) KPS, jKj n1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the usual model of authentication codes (or A-codes) due to Simmons <ref> [8] </ref>, there are three participants: a transmitter T , a receiver R and an opponent 1 O. T and R share an encoding rule (or key) e 2 E. Given a source state s 2 S, T sends a message m 2 M to R over a public channel.

Reference-contexts: O's cheating probability is the probability that ^m is accepted as authentic by R, and is denoted by P d i . An A-code is called without secrecy if m = (s; a), where a 2 A is an authenticator. Denote u = jAj. It was shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that P d i 1=u for all i 0. <p> We will identity A with Z u = f0; 1; ; u 1g. Proposition 2.1 <ref> [9] </ref> P d i 1=u for all i 0. <p> We say that an A-code without secrecy is t-fold secure if P d i = 1=u for 0 i t. Proposition 2.2 <ref> [9] </ref> In a t-fold secure A-code without secrecy, jEj u t+1 . Proposition 2.3 [10] In a 1-fold secure A-code without secrecy, jEj jSj (u 1) + 1: (3) 2.2 A Rao type bound for A-codes For t = 1, Proposition 2.3 is stronger than Proposition 2.2 for large jSj. <p> to see that any OA (t; k; v) implies the existence of a t-fold secure A-code without secrecy, (S; A; E; P E ), in which jSj = k, jAj = v, jEj = v t and in which P E is an equiprobable distribution on E (see, for example, <ref> [9, Theorem 5.3] </ref>). We will show that the Rao bound for orthogoanl arrays can be generalized to apply to any t-fold secure A-code without secrecy, and then characterize the case of equality. Let (S; A; E; P E ) be an A-code without secrecy, where A = Z u . <p> If there exists a t-(v; k; ) design, (X; B), then there exists a simultaneously t-secure A-code, (S; M; E; P S ; P E ), in which jSj = k, jM j = v, jEj = v k P E are equiprobable (see, e.g., <ref> [9, Theorem 6.2] </ref>). 3.3 A lower bound on the number of keys In this subsection, we will present a lower bound on jEj for simultaneously t-secure A-codes. Our bound generalizes the results proved in [7] which concerned the special case t = 2.

Reference-contexts: Further, if P d 0 = P d 1 = P d t = u then the following lower bound on the number of keys jEj was proved: jEj u t+1 : (1) Another bound on jEj was proved in <ref> [10] </ref> in the case t = 1: jEj jSj (u 1) + 1: (2) Observe that Eq. (2) is a stronger bound than Eq. (1) when jSj &gt; u + 1. <p> We say that an A-code without secrecy is t-fold secure if P d i = 1=u for 0 i t. Proposition 2.2 [9] In a t-fold secure A-code without secrecy, jEj u t+1 .

We also characterize the case of equality in terms of orthogonal arrays, which we define now.
