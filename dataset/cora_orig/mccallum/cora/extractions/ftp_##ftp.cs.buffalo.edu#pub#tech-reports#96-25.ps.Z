Title: A Framework for Supporting Quality-Based Presentation of Continuous Multimedia Streams  
Author: Thomas V Johnson and Aidong Zhang Bell Hall

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Buffalo  
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a framework for supporting the continuous and synchronized presentation of multimedia streams in a distributed multimedia system. Assuming that the network transmission and the server provide sufficient support for delivering media objects, important issues regarding the enforcement of smooth presentations of multimedia streams must be addressed at client sites. We develop various presentation scheduling algorithms that are adaptable to quality-of-service parameters. The significance of the proposed algorithms is to adjust the presentation from its insynchrony by gradually catching up or slowing down rather than using skipping/pausing in an abrupt fashion. Experimental analysis conducted for the proposed approaches demonstrates that our algorithms can avoid hiccups in presentations. This framework can be readily used to facilitate various applications, including education and training.

Reference-contexts: It may, for example, be necessary to display two distinct slide objects jointly within a single slide presentation stream. In general, the temporal relationship between two atomic objects in a single stream may conform to any of the thirteen temporal relationships described in <ref> [All83] </ref>. Media objects from different streams may need to be linked through time constraints to specify their synchronization; such time constraints are termed inter-stream constraints. The temporal relationship between two atomic objects from different media streams may also conform to any of the thirteen temporal relationships described in [All83]. <p> described in <ref> [All83] </ref>. Media objects from different streams may need to be linked through time constraints to specify their synchronization; such time constraints are termed inter-stream constraints. The temporal relationship between two atomic objects from different media streams may also conform to any of the thirteen temporal relationships described in [All83]. A multimedia presentation consists of a set of media streams upon which synchronization constraints are specified on the delivery operations to enforce both intra- and inter-stream synchronization.

Chaudhuri et al [CGS95] have investigated the problem of continuously displaying composite objects that are dynamically specified. <p> Chaudhuri et al [CGS95] have investigated the problem of continuously displaying composite objects that are dynamically specified. Courtiat et al [COC94] have proposed a conditional delivery mechanism to schedule media objects based on their synchronization requirements. Thimm and Klas <ref> [TK95b] </ref> introduced a rule-based scheduling approach to generate adaptive multimedia presentations.

Reference-contexts: Studies have investigated the modeling of the synchronization aspects of multimedia data from a conceptual perspective, including graphical models, Petri-Net based models, object-oriented models, and temporal abstraction models <ref> [Tom89, DC91, LG90b, SF89, Mas91, GBT94] </ref>. These models provide illustrative vehicles for specifying synchronization semantics at the application level. Importance of formulating quality-of-service (QoS) metrics for continuity and synchronization specifications in media streams has also been realized [VKvBG95, AFKN95, NS95, SWM95, WS96, ZG96].

Given these specification approaches, it is important to realize the appropriate QoS parameters for the presentation of various media streams and their synchronization in systems. <p> For example, Little and Ghafoor [LG90a] have proposed several parameters to measure the QoS for multimedia data presentation. These QoS parameters are used to specify the requirements of multimedia data presentation. A more formal specification of QoS parameters are offered in <ref> [WS96] </ref>, some of the important parameters are integrated into the presentation scheduling proposed below. In particular, we will consider the following QoS parameters: * Individual stream (intra-stream constraints): Maximum rate change: denotes the range within which the rendition rate of stream s can vary. <p> Various system delays may result in the presentation of a stream to either slower or faster, which might cause jitter between the presentation of streams. We say that a presentation is acceptable if it is within the permissible QoS ranges. Several other QoS parameters discussed in <ref> [WS96] </ref> can also be incorporated into our framework. Note that the scheduler at a client site need not consider the concurrent execution of multiple multimedia presentations.

Reference-contexts: Given these specification approaches, it is important to realize the appropriate QoS parameters for the presentation of various media streams and their synchronization in systems. Substantial research has been directed toward the support of synchronization within operating systems and network architectures <ref> [RV93, Ste90, AH91, RRK93, GR93, ZF93, GVKR95] </ref>. Through this research, new behavioral concepts required for multimedia data have been identified and mechanisms have been proposed to enhance such conventional storage, synchronization, and communication mechanisms as random disk allocation, semaphores, monitors, or RPC.
