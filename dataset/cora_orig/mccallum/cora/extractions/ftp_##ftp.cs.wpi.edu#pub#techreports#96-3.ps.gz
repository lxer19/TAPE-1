Abstract: Mobile computing environments are traditionally resource-constrained with mobile computers typically characterized by less network bandwidth and power availability than stationary computers. Ideally, users should be able to experience both mobility and performance without sacrificing one for another. Therefore, there is a need for information retrieval policies that are resource efficient. In this work we propose policies for doing resource-efficient information transfer. The basis of the proposed policies is that information users tend to have different levels of interest for components within an information element. The new policies we propose use a user profile in filtering out the "useless" or "uninteresting" information components, to minimize the amount of information transferred and processed. The work focuses on an implementation for the transfer of network news to minimize wireless bandwidth and mobile computer power use. The implementation was done through modifications to the xrn newsreader and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) for a filter process to transfer individual article components (such as headers or screens of the article body) to the mobile host. The transfer policies are evaluated individually and in combination with respect to network bandwidth and the number of requests needed for the newsreader to obtain components of a article. Behavior of the policies with respect to information transfer latency is also evaluated. The results from testing show that for a variety of users and article sizes, user profile-based

The work classifies the components of an interprocess message hierarchically according to the degree of importance to help distinguish vital data from incidental data. Follow-up work has been to translate this approach into a generalized architecture for distributed systems [13].

The work at Sun indexes mail messages server based on attributes of the message and then the complete mail item is fetched from the mail server. This approach uses component-level information in the filtering operation, but does not do component-level filtering.

As Figure 1 illustrates, conventional information filtering is used to identify those information elements most likely of interest to a user.

The header portion contains a number of header fields, with each header field on a separate line of text.

The results shown are for two scenarios: typical users, typical articles and typical users, large articles. <p> Within the network news domain we plan to examine profiles that take into account the fact that articles are of different sizes. We have proposed generating not a single user profile, but a set of profiles|one for each article size <ref> [10] </ref>. Another direction is to exploit the redundancy among information elements. It is common for the contents of a news article to be included in subsequent articles. With a component cache on the mobile host, this redundancy could be exploited.
