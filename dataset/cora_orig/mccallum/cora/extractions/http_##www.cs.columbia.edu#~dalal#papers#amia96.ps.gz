Abstract: We describe MAGIC, an experimental system for generating multimedia briefings about the clinical status of post-bypass patients entering a cardiac ICU. MAGIC is a distributed system whose components use knowledge-based techniques for planning and generating briefings in text, speech, and graphics. These briefings are coordinated together by reasoning with dynamically generated temporal and spatial constraints. Formative evaluation using system mock-ups with ICU nurses and residents have been used to determine the general format and content of these briefings. We present an overview of MAGIC's architecture and show what it can currently generate.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Caregivers are tremendous consumers of information, requiring updates on patient clinical status, care plans, and test results. However, it is often difficult for them to obtain only the information that they need in a concise form. Our objective is to develop tools for automatically producing multimedia briefings <ref> [1] </ref> that meet the information needs of a variety of caregivers, including different specialists and nurses.

Since determining inconsistency is intractable in general, the constraint solver uses an anytime algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> that sometimes returns the result maybe consistent. The component that generated the constraint may decide to wait for a definite answer, or may proceed further making some tentative assumption of its own, which it must be willing to revoke when a different definite answer is obtained.

Reference-contexts: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE MAGIC consists of several distributed system components that work cooperatively on different sub-tasks of generating multimedia briefings (Fig. 3). The entire system is integrated using ILU (Inter-Language Unification package) <ref> [5] </ref>, which makes it possible for the different components to share data structures and communicate efficiently across different hardware platforms and implementation languages. Prototypes of individual components have been implemented and partially integrated. The data server accesses several medical databases for collecting information about the patient's condition.

Reference-contexts: They will also rely on a constraint solver that represents the constraints among the different parts of the presentation plan and ensures that they are mutually consistent. The domain hierarchy, which is partially drawn from MED (Medical Entities Dictionary) <ref> [6] </ref>, describes the hierarchical grouping of relevant medical and patient data. For example, it represents that the demographic information about a patient consists of name, medical record number, gender, and birth date, and that the name in turn consists of first name, middle name, and last name.

Reference-contexts: The presentation plan contains the structure of the entire briefing. It includes the high-level communicative goals as well the low-level tasks obtained by refining them. This plan provides a common data structure for different components to share information. The presentation plan includes several temporal and spatial constraints <ref> [7] </ref>; for example, the demographics information should be displayed before the test results. Although these constraints are generated by several system components and at several different times, a coherent briefing can be generated at the end only if all these constraints are mutually consistent.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for example, speech just says Two IVs while the textual labels spell out that they are peripheral.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, many interfaces for healthcare applications rely on the more traditional approach of retrieving pieces of canned text or stored images. A few exceptions include research in language generation on tailoring textual descriptions for individual patients.

[12] also work on patient specific explanations, having developed a system which can produce natural language descriptions of migraines and respond to follow-up questions requesting further information.

Weitzman and Witten-burg <ref> [17] </ref> also handle media coordination in their work on generating multimedia presentations. While they can accommodate dynamic relationships among presentation elements, they do not support the ability to replan a presentation as we do in MAGIC, and output is also limited to static text and graphics.
