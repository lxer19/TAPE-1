Abstract: Spatial-temporal decompositions of climatologic fields have been obtained using a range of techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and principal oscillation patterns (POPS). PCA decompositions are forced to be correlated to the original field but they may not capture interesting aspects of temporal variation. On the other hand, POPS decompositions focus on temporal variation but are not forced to correlate to the field. Here we introduce a hybrid of these methods which attempts to retain desirable aspects of both PCA and POPS. The approach attempts to project the field onto a lower dimensional subspace with the property that the average error associated with forecasting a future state of the field on the basis of the history contained in the projection is minimized. A recursive algorithm for estimating a spatial-temporal decomposition based on this idea is developed. The methodology is applied to a 47-year climatological record of the 5-day average 500 millibar height anomaly field sampled on a 445 grid over the Northern hemisphere extra-tropics. Some asymptotic properties of the estimation method for the new technique are examined in a simple situation. Although the estimation method requires a consistent estimator of a certain spectral density matrix, the target parameters are estimated at a parametric rate. Interestingly, the details of the nonparametric estimation of the spectral density, such as the choice of the smoothing kernel, do not appear to affect the asymptotic variance of the target parameters. Key-words: geopotential height anomaly, one-step ahead forecast error, principal components, principal oscillation patterns, spectral density matrix. fl Charles Kooperberg is assistant professor and Finbarr O'Sullivan is professor, Department of Statistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-4322.

Reference-contexts: One thrust has been to separate spatial and temporal variation via representations consisting of a limited number of fixed spatial patterns, each with its own characteristic temporal forcing. Such representations have been achieved using a collection of statistical of techniques, including principal components analysis (PCA) <ref> (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987, Wallace, Smith and Bretherton 1992) </ref>. A more recent innovation in the atmospheric science literature is a technique known as principal oscillation patterns analysis (POPS) (Hasselmann 1988, Von Storch, Burns, Fischer-Burns and Hasselmann 1988, Von Storch 1994). <p> Predictive Oscillation Patterns 13 For the POPS analysis the same projected data was used. However, for POPS such a projection is needed as a method to regularize the patterns (Von Storch et al. 1988). Similar projections have been commonly used in other analyses of such data sets <ref> (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987, Wallace et al. 1992) </ref>. As in Figure 2, the percent variance explained and the percent forecast error obtained on the second half of the data are also indicated. The first PROP is very similar to the first PCA.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of the fluid motion is of substantial interest in atmospheric science and oceanography <ref> (Chelton, 1994, Panel on Statistics and Oceanography, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The steepest descent algorithm only requires that the gradient of the objective function be computed. Explicit formulas for these gradients are used. In general steepest descent methods are more robust than more sophisticated Newton based methods even though the local convergence characteristics of Newton methods are superior <ref> (Dennis and Schnabel 1983) </ref>. The most time consuming part of the computation is the calculation and storage of the spectral density matrix estimates. In view of this, the additional efficiency one might achieve using Newton methods is likely to be negligible.

The patterns indicate a connection between the behavior of the atmosphere over the North Pacific and North America.

Reference-contexts: The temporal forcing z (t) are obtained by a least-squares regression of x (t) on the spatial patterns. Although the first K principal components are defined by the property that they define the closest K-dimensional subspace to the p-dimensional marginal distribution of the field <ref> (Mardia, Kent and Bibby 1979) </ref>, there is no explicit constraint on the temporal structure of the associated forcing functions, the z (t), since this definition is in terms of the marginal distribution.

Reference-contexts: The POPS analysis is motivated by a first order Markov model AR (1) for the field <ref> (Priestley 1987, Chapter 9) </ref>. If the field followed the AR (1) model then x (t) = Bx (t 1) + *(t); where *(t) is assumed to be a mean zero uncorrelated (in time) process. <p> Using a kernel approach, the spectral density estimate is f (h) X k h (! ! j )I (T ) where k h (s) = 2 T h k (s=h), h &gt; 0, and k () is a kernel which integrates to unity and satisfies desired moment conditions <ref> (Priestley 1987, Silverman 1986) </ref>. As h ! 0, f (h) xx reduces to the standard periodogram estimator of the spectral density: a sum of delta-functions at the frequencies ! j . <p> These estimates were computed using an automated spectral density estimator developed by Kooperberg, Stone and Truong (1995). In these graphs the forcing functions have been normalized to have unit variance so all spectra integrate to the same value. This allows one to compare one-step prediction variances 2 2 <ref> (see Priestley, 1987, eqn 10.1.41) </ref>. We evaluated the integral in (5) numerically for each of the twelve spectral densities in Figure 5. The results are summarized in Table 1. <p> The PROPS patterns have a richer structure than that of a simple AR (1) model. Fitting AR-models to the forcing functions lead to models with orders between 6 and 23, using an AIC model selection criterion <ref> (Priestley 1987) </ref>. The deviation from the AR (1) structure potentially undermines the ability to appeal to the elegant interpretation of POPS representations developed by Von Storch et al. (1988). The forecast error performance of the different methods are compared in Figure 6. <p> More sophisticated approaches to constructing spatial-temporal representations for a field might also be considered. A natural approach would be to consider representations in terms of a state space or latent variable model <ref> (Priestley 1987) </ref>, e.g. x (t) = Az (t) + *(t).

As such, the geopotential height field has been studied extensively in the atmospheric sciences, both by itself, and in relation to other variables, such as the sea-surface temperature (see, for example, Dickson and Namias 1976, Horel, 1981, Kushnir and Wallace 1989, Wallace et al. 1992).
