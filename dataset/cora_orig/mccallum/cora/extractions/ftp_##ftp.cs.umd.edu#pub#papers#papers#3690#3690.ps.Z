Title: A Customizable Simulator for Workstation Networks

Abstract: We present a customizable simulator called netsim for high-performance point-to-point workstation networks that is accurate enough to be used for application-level performance analysis yet is easy enough to customize for multiple architectures and software configurations. Customiza- tion is accomplished without using any proprietary information, using only publicly available hardware specifications and information that can be readily determined using a suite of test programs. We customized netsim for two platforms: a 16-node IBM SP-2 with a multistage network and a 10-node DEC Alpha Farm with an ATM switch. We show that netsim successfully models these two architectures with a 2-6% error on the SP-2 and a 10% error on the Alpha Farm for most test cases. It achieves this accuracy at the cost of a 7-36 fold simulation slowdown with respect to the SP-2 and a 3-8 fold slowdown with respect to the Alpha Farm. In addition, we show that the cross-traffic congestion for today's high-speed point-to-point networks has little, if any, effect on application-level performance and that modeling end-point congestion is sufficient for a reasonably accurate simulation.

Reference-contexts: Netsim is geared towards optimized libraries which do not make use of source buffering for large messages. As a result, netsim does not capture the sender behavior as well as it does on the SP-2. 4 Related Work Many analytical models have been developed for analyzing network interconnects <ref> [1, 3, 9, 16] </ref>. Even though it is more convenient to use analytical models for the analysis, it is very difficult to obtain accurate models for complex systems. Analytical models are usually complemented with simulation for the missing accuracy.

Reference-contexts: We can testify first-hand about the six months we spent trying to track down performance problems in a set of communication- intensive programs with irregular communication patterns 1 <ref> [2] </ref>. A fast and reasonably accurate simulator would significantly simplify this task. However, building a simulator for the communication subsystem, let alone the entire machine is not feasible for the average user.
