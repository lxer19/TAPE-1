Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic characteristics of optimum uniform scalar quantizers as N, the number of levels, becomes large. It is shown that the length of the support region increases as (ln N) 1/a , when applied to a random variable with a generalized Gaussian density of the form p(x) = ae -b|x| a

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this result does not hold for the best lattice quantizers, and not even the best uniform scalar quantizers; for Bucklew and Gallagher <ref> [3] </ref> have shown that for distributions with infinite support, the MSE of the best uniform scalar quantizers does not decrease as rapidly as the 1/N 2 indicated in (1). <p> A similar equation was derived for the ordinary Gaussian density by Bucklew <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Accordingly, with knowledge of (3), we reused (2) to derive the following better approximation to L: 2 h (a ,s ) 1/ a (2 - a a 2 2 -1/ a G (1/ a ) + o (1) 1 (4) III. MeanSquared Error For densities with a heavy tail, <ref> [3] </ref> showed that the usual D 2 /12 approximation to the MSE may not be accurate, in that the ratio of the MSE to D 2 /12 may approach, as N fi , a limit that is strictly greater than one. <p> It follows that the MSE of an optimum uniform scalar quantizer takes the form D c 2 / a 2 . This verifies the empirical result of <ref> [3] </ref> for the Gaussian case. Equivalently, in terms of R = log 2 N, the signal-to-noise ratio increases as 6R - (20/a) log 10 R dB/bit.
