Abstract: The classical Schwarz alternating method has recently been generalized in several directions. This effort has resulted in a number of new powerful domain decomposition methods for elliptic problems, in new insight into multigrid methods and in the development of a very useful framework for the analysis of a variety of iterative methods. Most of this work has focused on positive definite, symmetric problems. In this paper a general framework is developed for multiplicative Schwarz algorithms for nonsymmetric and indefinite problems. Several applications are then discussed including two- and multi-level Schwarz methods and iterative substructuring algorithms. Some new results on additive Schwarz methods are also presented.

Reference-contexts: In conclusion, we note that there are other multilevel decompositions for which the general framework and abstract theory can be used to obtain new results. Among them are Yserentant's decomposition, cf. Bank, Dupont, and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref> and Yserentant [36], and the multilevel diagonal scaling method developed by Zhang [37]. This latter method can be viewed as a generalization of the BPX method due to Bramble, Pasciak, and Xu [5].

Reference-contexts: We can also replace the projections by other operators, T i : V ! V i ; which approximate them. The analysis of the general multiplicative case introduces additional difficulties. Recently, Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu <ref> [4] </ref> and Xu [34] have made substantial progress towards developing a general theory for the symmetric, positive definite case. In this paper, we extend the theory to a class of nonsymmetric and indefinite problems. <p> If, for a particular application, it is not necessary to include such a space, we can just drop V 0 : We note that Bramble et al. <ref> [4] </ref> considered a somewhat more general situation; however, in the interest of keeping the presentation simple, we limit our discussion to the case of one special subspace. <p> In Section 2, we develop an abstract theory for the multiplicative Schwarz method just introduced. This work is inspired by the work by Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu <ref> [4] </ref> and Xu [34]. <p> Inequality (4) is obtained by a straightforward computation.

There exists a constant C 0 &gt; 0, such that J X T T 0 I: Obtaining a bound for C 0 is often one of the most difficult part of the analysis of Schwarz methods in any specific application.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the paper, we also comment on additive Schwarz methods. This paper does not include any numerical results. We refer to Cai, Gropp, and Keyes <ref> [9] </ref> for an extensive experimental study of many methods for nonsymmetric and indefinite problems. So far, most of the work on Schwarz methods has been restricted to the symmetric case. <p> We note that recent results by Dryja and Widlund [33] provide bounds on the rate of convergence as a function of ff and that, in our experience, the performance is often quite satisfactory even when the overlap is on the order h; cf. Cai, Gropp, and Keyes <ref> [9] </ref>. We associate an undirected graph with the decomposition f ext i g: Each node of the graph represents an extended subdomain and each edge the intersection of two such subdomains.

An Abstract Theory for Schwarz Methods. <p> An upper bound for k P J i=0 T i k a is required in the analysis of additive Schwarz methods, see Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>; it is often relatively easily obtained by providing an upper bound for (E): A lower bound on the same operator is obtained, in the symmetric, positive definite case, by estimating the parameter C 0 of an inequality similar to that of Assumption 2 introduced below. <p> A bound on the rate of convergence of the conjugate gradient method follows from (9) in a routine way. Similarly, in the theory developed by Cai [6] and Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>, a lower bound for a ( P N i=0 T i u; u) and an upper bound for k P J i=0 T i k a are required to obtain an estimate of the rate of convergence of the GMRES and other Krylov space 5 based iterative methods that are <p> The same estimates hold if we replace the bilinear form s (; ) by c (; ) and/or P i by T i . The proof for the exact oblique projections follows directly from Section 4 of Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>. For general T i the result follows from a minor modification of these arguments. We can now prove that Assumption 1 is satisfied for the mappings P i and T i . Lemma 6. <p> We refer to Section 4 of Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>, or Lemma 8 of this paper, for a proof of Assumption 2, i.e. that J X P T 0 I: Here C 0 is independent of the mesh parameters h and H: A minor modification of the proof in [10] shows that this bound also holds if P i is <p> We refer to Section 4 of Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>, or Lemma 8 of this paper, for a proof of Assumption 2, i.e. that J X P T 0 I: Here C 0 is independent of the mesh parameters h and H: A minor modification of the proof in [10] shows that this bound also holds if P i is replaced by T i : In the study of Schwarz methods with this subspace decomposition and the coloring introduced earlier in this section, a bound for (E) is very easy to obtain; we only need the elementary inequality (E) J <p> C (J + ffi i + 1)ku h k a ; 8u h 2 V h ;(23) a (T u h ; u h ) cC 2 a ; 8u h 2 V h :(24) We note that a proof of Theorem 3 is given already in Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.3. Iterative Substructuring Algorithms in Two Dimensions. We now consider an iterative substructuring method for problems in two dimensions. In defining the partition of the finite element space into subspaces, we use the same coarse space V H as in Section 4.1. <p> Theorems 2 and 3 hold with this C 2 0 : The estimates of the other parameters, such as (E) J; can easily be found using the techniques as before. We note that a proof of the result for the additive case is given already in Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>. The corresponding problems for three dimensions appears to be open. 5. Multilevel Schwarz Type Methods. In this section, we consider a class of additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods using (L + 1) rather than two levels. <p> Proof. Our point of departure is an inequality established in Lemma 5 of Cai and Widlund <ref> [10] </ref>: (1 CH 2 )a (u; u) b (u; u) + CkP 0 uk a kuk a ; 8u 2 V h :(26) From the definition of the operators P l i and Lemma 7, we find that b (u; u) = l=0 i=1 i ) = l=0 i=1 i u;

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The analysis of the classical Schwarz alternating method, discovered more than 120 years ago by Hermann Amandus Schwarz, was originally based on the use of a maximum principle; cf. e.g. <ref> [30] </ref>. The method can also conveniently be studied using a calculus of variation. This approach is quite attractive because it allows us to include elliptic problems, such as the systems of linear elasticity, which do not satisfy a maximum principle.

In this section, we consider a class of additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods using (L + 1) rather than two levels. Following Dryja and Widlund [18] and Zhang <ref> [37] </ref>, we introduce a sequence of nested quasi-uniform finite element triangulations fT l g L l=0 : Here T 0 = ft 0 i g N 0 i=1 is the coarsest triangulation and t 0 i represents a substructure. <p> The finite element space V h = V L can be represented as V L = l=0 L X J l X V l Xuejun Zhang <ref> [37] </ref> has shown that the decomposition (25) is uniformly bounded in the sense of the following Lemma Lemma 7. <p> u = l=0 i=1 i : Moreover, there exists a constant C 0 , which is independent of the parameters h, H and L, such that L X J l X ku l a C 2 a ; 8u 2 V h : This result is first established, in Zhang <ref> [37] </ref>, under the assumption of H 2 regularity, e.g. in the case of convex regions, and then a proof, based on a recent result by Oswald [29], is given in the general regularity-free case. <p> Here we can use a result due to Zhang 16 <ref> [37] </ref>, which provides bounds on the parameters " l;k i;j for the subspace decomposition fV l i g and the mappings fP l i g considered in this section. Lemma 9. <p> In conclusion, we note that there are other multilevel decompositions for which the general framework and abstract theory can be used to obtain new results. Among them are Yserentant's decomposition, cf. Bank, Dupont, and Yserentant [1] and Yserentant [36], and the multilevel diagonal scaling method developed by Zhang <ref> [37] </ref>. This latter method can be viewed as a generalization of the BPX method due to Bramble, Pasciak, and Xu [5].
