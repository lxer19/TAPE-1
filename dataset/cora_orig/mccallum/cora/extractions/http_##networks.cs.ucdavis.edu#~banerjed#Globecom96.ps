Abstract: We explore an optical network architecture which employs dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology and passive Waveguide Grating Routers (WGRs) to establish a virtual topology based on lightpath communication. We examine the motivation and the technical challenges involved in this approach, propose and examine the characteristics of a network design algorithm, and provide some illustrative performance results.

Reference-contexts: The component crosstalk in a WRS is high relative to that in a WGR, and hence adjacent wavelengths supported in a WRS-based network need to be widely spaced apart.

Reference-contexts: 1 Network Architecture A wavelength-routed, optical network employs all-optical channels (lightpaths) on multiple wavelengths to establish a rearrangeable transport layer (virtual topology) 1 <ref> [3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19, 21] </ref>. A lightpath may span multiple fiber-links, and may need to be optically routed at an intermediate node without undergoing electronic conversion. <p> A routing node in this wavelength-routed network architecture (Fig. 2) consists of an optical component for wavelength routing of all-optical lightpaths, and an electronic component for origination and termination of light-paths, viz., electronic add-drop multiplexing, and for electronic switching (traffic forwarding) between lightpaths <ref> [3, 11, 12, 19, 21] </ref>. We employ a Waveguide Grating Router (WGR) [9] as a passive wavelength router in the optical subcomponent of the routing node (see Fig. 2). <p> M 2 connetions to be established using M wavelengths. 4 routers has also been studied [5]. 3 Motivation, Challenges, and an Illustrative Example 3.1 Motivation A number of studies have been conducted on WDM network design using the Wavelength Routing Switch (WRS) as a routing element in a mesh-connected network <ref> [1, 3, 7, 21, 24] </ref>. A WRS can independently route any wavelength from a given input port to any output port.

Reference-contexts: Local search algorithms examine small changes to a complete assignment of variables in a constraint problem and select one of the changes which improves the number of satisfied constraints the most <ref> [18, 22] </ref>. This procedure is sometimes referred to as gradient ascent or hill-climbing. Since complete search of all virtual topologies appears to be costly, local search is an attractive alternative.
