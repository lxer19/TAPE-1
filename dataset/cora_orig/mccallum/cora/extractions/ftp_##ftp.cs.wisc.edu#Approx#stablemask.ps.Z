Reference-contexts: Now apply the equivalence of (a) and (b) in Result 3.5. In the second part of this section we present selected results on PSI spaces. We first recall the following result from <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: Result 3.7. Let S be a PSI n space, and let be a generator of S.

Reference-contexts: Given a refinable , one considers the PSI space S := S () generated by (the shifts of) . While generates S by definition, there are many other functions in S which generate it. For example, every non-zero compactly supported 0 2 S generates S (cf. <ref> [BDR2] </ref> for more details). For computational purposes, it is essential to find a favourable generator for S, where "favourable" is meant in the sense of satisfying any of the following three properties, which are listed in increasing difficulty of attainment. 1 Definition 1.2. <p> Results that deal with special choices of generators are not needed here, hence are not mentioned. We do mention in passing that general discussion of the non-compactly supported case can be found in [JM2] and <ref> [BDR2] </ref>, and that results concerning the case of several compactly supported generators are obtained in [JM1]. The basic result concerning the independence of the shifts of a compactly supported was obtained in [R1] (see also [DM1]): Result 3.1. <p> Every compactly supported function in S (in particular ) is a finite linear combination of the n-shifts of 0 . Finally, 0 2 L 2 (IR) if is so. We refer to <ref> [BDR2] </ref> for a further elaboration of (b) above. For the purposes here, we need to convert (b) of Result 3.2 to the Fourier domain.

Reference-contexts: The interesting paper [JW] solves the above problem completely, and two of its three main results are quoted in x5 of the present paper.

The definition given here is taken from [BDR3] (see also [JS]) and frees the mask function from various restrictions imposed on it in earlier definitions. <p> For the readers' benefit, results which are not specifically univariate are stated in their natural multivariate setting. (The multivariate extension of the notions and definitions from the introduction is, by large, self-understood, and can be found e.g., in <ref> [JM2] </ref> and [BDR2,3].) We start the discussion with a quick overview of stability and linear independence. <p> Results that deal with special choices of generators are not needed here, hence are not mentioned.

Finally, we invoke Theorem 2.4 of <ref> [JM2] </ref> to conclude the following: 6 Proposition 3.10. Assume that the compactly supported L 2 (IR d )-function satisfies the n-refinement equation b = A b (=n): Assume further, that A is continuous at the origin. <p> Then either A (0) = 1, or b vanishes on 2ZZ d (and hence, by Result 3.5, its shifts are not stable). Proof. We want to use Theorem 2.4 of <ref> [JM2] </ref>. This theorem, which is stated for a 2-refinable , extends verbatim to an n-refinable . It assumes that 2 L 1 (IR d ), an assumption that our , being compactly supported and square-summable, satisfies.

Let and b be as in Result 3.1, assume that d = 1, and let n &gt; 0 be given. <p> Since b is known to vanish at some z 2 TTn1, b had a real 2-periodic zero, and hence, by Result 3.5, the shifts of are unstable. 5. Jia-Wang characterizations revisited and extended The following two theorems were proved in <ref> [JW] </ref>: 9 Result 5.1. Assume that 2 L 2 (IR) is compactly supported and 2-refinable with respect to a trigonometric polynomial mask A and corresponding symbol a. Assume also that a (1) = 1. <p> In the first part of the section we show how Result 5.1 can be explained via the result of Theorem 2.3. Result 5.2 can be approached very similarly. In the second part of the section, we discuss suitable generalizations of the <ref> [JW] </ref> results to n-refinable functions. One should notice in the two theorems an apparent asymmetry between symmetric roots on the unit circle and other symmetric roots. <p> Off-hand, one might guess that the asymmetry between the real roots and the other roots of the mask (mentioned in the previous paragraph) is due to the fact that all the cases of rational masks were not covered in the <ref> [JW] </ref> study. This, however, is not true: if a is properly rational, it must have a symmetric zero. The truth is straightforward: the lack of symmetric zeros leaves only very little room for linear dependence. Here are the details (compare with Lemma 1 of [JW]). 10 Suppose that we are given <p> masks were not covered in the <ref> [JW] </ref> study. This, however, is not true: if a is properly rational, it must have a symmetric zero. The truth is straightforward: the lack of symmetric zeros leaves only very little room for linear dependence.
