Abstract: We discuss two-stage preconditioners for solving systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations in the modeling of underground multiphase flow phenomena. The linear systems arising from the discretization and Newton linearization are nonsymmetric and indefinite but coefficient blocks associated with a particular type of unknown possess properties that can be exploited to improve the conditioning of the coupled system. We show through theoretical discussion and numerical experiments that decoupling strategies combined with two-stage preconditioners are more effective to accelerate Krylov subspace methods such as GMRES and BiCGSTAB than standard ones which "blindly" precondition the entire coupled linear system. We also show a distributed memory parallel implementation of some of the iterative schemes proposed in this work.

Reference-contexts: In general, in system (6), the block coefficients J pp ; J pc and J cp share the following properties (see e.g., [3] for further physical insights and <ref> [2] </ref> for mathematical definitions and related theoretical results): Diagonal dominance, Positive diagonal entries and negative off-diagonal entries (i.e., they are Z-matrices), and Irreducibility. <p> The one above corresponds to D 1 J, and the one below to f W e J (or equivalently, W J.) The straightforward proof can be found in [23]. It can also be shown that the diagonal blocks J D pp and J D cc are positive stable <ref> [2, Theorem 6.12, page 211] </ref>. The effect of these properties can be seen in Figure 4 which shows the spectrum of the resulting Jacobian matrix after applying the decoupling operators D 1 and f W .

Reference-contexts: A more thorough description of the model can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> All other variables can then be computed explicitly based on these two. In the case of slight compressibility, our system in the primary unknowns includes one nonlinear parabolic equation in terms of pressure and one nonlinear convection-diffusion equation in terms of concentration <ref> [3] </ref>. In this model, there are weak nonlinearities related to those variables that depend upon pressures of one phase (e.g., densities) and their effect depends on the degree of pressure change. In contrast, strong nonlinearities are present in variables that depend on concentrations such as relative permeability and capillary pressure. <p> Small compressibility allows for some simplifications, without affecting the validity of the numerical approximation. The above procedure follows the description by Wheeler and Smith [33] on developing a parallel black-oil simulator. Further insights about discretization of these equations can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.3 Newton framework The fully implicit formulation of the two-phase black-oil equations leads to the solution of (3) for each time step, which can be abstractly represented by F (u) = 0, where F : IR n ! IR n . <p> We can observe the effect of the upstream weighting within the block J pc with no superdiagonal coefficients, which are added to the main diagonal of that block. 7 3.2 An algebraic analysis of the coupled Jacobian matrix The presence of slight compressibility ensures invertibility of the Jacobian matrix <ref> [3] </ref>. In general, in system (6), the block coefficients J pp ; J pc and J cp share the following properties (see e.g., [3] for further physical insights and [2] for mathematical definitions and related theoretical results): Diagonal dominance, Positive diagonal entries and negative off-diagonal entries (i.e., they are Z-matrices), and <p> the main diagonal of that block. 7 3.2 An algebraic analysis of the coupled Jacobian matrix The presence of slight compressibility ensures invertibility of the Jacobian matrix <ref> [3] </ref>. In general, in system (6), the block coefficients J pp ; J pc and J cp share the following properties (see e.g., [3] for further physical insights and [2] for mathematical definitions and related theoretical results): Diagonal dominance, Positive diagonal entries and negative off-diagonal entries (i.e., they are Z-matrices), and Irreducibility.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this is no longer true under large changes in concentrations likely occurring at high flow rates or at larger time steps. Bank et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, with their alternate-block factorization (ABF) method, propose a simple way to weaken the coupling of drift-diffusion equations that occur in semiconductor device modeling. They use greatly simplifying assumptions, however, to analyze the decoupling process for preconditioning linear systems. <p> All main diagonal entries of the main diagonal blocks are equal to one and those of the off-diagonal blocks are all equal to zero. In fact, we can expect that the degree of coupling of the off-diagonal blocks of J has been reduced to some extent. Bank et. al. <ref> [4] </ref> observe that this operation weakens the coupling between the partial differential equations. Note that the operation is simple to carry out and may not imply alterations to the underlying data structure holding the coefficients (e.g., diagonal matrix storage).

Reference-contexts: In fact, Behie and Vinsome <ref> [7] </ref> comment about the possibility of decoupling more equations in their method but only with respect pressure coefficients.

Reference-contexts: They are also known as inner-outer or inexact iterations [13,20]. In the context of preconditioning they have been referred to as nonlinear, variable or inner-outer preconditioners [2,27]. They have been also subject of study in parallel computing settings (e.g. see <ref> [11] </ref> and further references therein.) However, in the context of large-scale systems of coupled equations they strangely seem to have been overlooked. The renewed interest in using two-stage methods is due to recent developments in Krylov-subspace methods that make the solution of the large inner linear systems affordable.

Reference-contexts: In a similar way, y i+1=2 and z i+1=2 are defined. Dawson et al. <ref> [12] </ref> extended this to a 19-point stencil in space and use a full permeability tensor to handle underground heterogeneities. Numerical experiments in Section 6 are done using this extension. <p> The main goal here is to prevent oversolving of the equation whenever there is a considerable disagreement between the nonlinear function F and its local linear model.

Finally, full description and several pointers into the literature of Krylov subspace iterative methods can be found in [5]. <p> Therefore, matrix-vector products involve data communication of each node with its four lateral and four corner neighbors <ref> [12] </ref>. Table 4 (Intel Paragon) shows that both GMRES and BiCGSTAB algorithms perform similarly for a problem of modest difficulty (i.e., for t = :05).

Reference-contexts: They use greatly simplifying assumptions, however, to analyze the decoupling process for preconditioning linear systems. Recent experiences with Bank et al. decoupling operator are reported in <ref> [19] </ref>. Their work has value in the context of multi-phase flow since their decoupling operator leads to a significant clustering of eigenvalues associated with Jaco-bian matrices occurring during the simulation process. <p> We believe that better results at lower computational demands can be obtained by incorporating more information contained in the decoupled blocks and improving the performance of each subsystem solution. Finally, we remark that Fan et al. just recently arrived at similar observations in the context of microelectronic device simulation <ref> [19] </ref>. They experimentally observed that further preconditioning after the decoupling stage with the ABF transformation proposed by Bank et al. resulted in significant improvement compared to block preconditioning alone. 6 Computational experiments We include both sequential and parallel implementations.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to flow in porous media applications, the global discretized equation is never assembled and solved in its entirety for fully implicit formulations. Many variations are possible (see e.g., <ref> [21] </ref>) ranging from solving separately for each nodal unknown to solving simultaneously for all the degrees of freedom associated with one or some (but not all) of the primary unknowns.

Reference-contexts: Among the 19 several variants, we construct a third preconditioner inspired by the discrete projection method proposed by Turek <ref> [28] </ref> to solve saddle point formulations arising from the discretization of Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The algorithm departs from an approximation to the Schur complement with respect pressures and solves iteratively the hyperbolic component given by the velocities (role represented by concentrations in our case). <p> The first step in Algorithm 6 is introduced to avoid an additional and costly iteration to solve J D cc q = r D w , as suggested in Step 1 of Algorithm 5. The operator J 1 cc is chosen to be computationally cheap. Turek <ref> [28] </ref> suggests that J 1 cc be the inverse of the diagonal part of J cc (i.e., Jacobi preconditioner) which clearly reduces to the identity matrix in our case.
