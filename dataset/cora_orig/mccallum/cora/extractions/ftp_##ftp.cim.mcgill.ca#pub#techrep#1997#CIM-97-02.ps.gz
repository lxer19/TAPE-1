Moreover, as mentioned in <ref> [2, 11, 22] </ref>, the behaviour of friction in the low speed region is different than that in the high speed. Therefore, another low speed experiment is required to excite the stick-slip or Stribeck friction. <p> Space permits here only a brief outline of the new modelling achievements of this kind 3. DC-Motor Identification 29 of friction, and a more complete discussion can be found in <ref> [2, 16, 22] </ref>. Figure 20 illustrates the friction shape as a function of velocity. A few mathematical models are developed for the friction. <p> The ratio of standard deviation to the average value has less than 25% deviation for different results, which is within the acceptable limits. However, the negative sign of the Stribeck friction coefficient is not consistent with the experimental results reported in the literature <ref> [2, 16] </ref>. Nevertheless, this represents rising friction at low velocities as illustrated in Figure 41, and no stiction, verifying the manufacturers claim [8].

Another velocity dependent model is proposed, which better captures the structural damping hysteresis for harmonic drive.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that this model is a dynamic model, since the first derivative of the friction is related to the velocity and the friction torque itself. There is a modified version of Dahl's model, perhaps first discussed by Threlfall <ref> [26] </ref>, in which i = 2.
