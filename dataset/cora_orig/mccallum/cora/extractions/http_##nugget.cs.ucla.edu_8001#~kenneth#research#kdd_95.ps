Abstract: The important scientific challenge of understanding global climate change is one that clearly requires the application of knowledge discovery and datamining techniques on a massive scale. Advances in parallel supercomputing technology, enabling high-resolution modeling, as well as in sensor technology, allowing data capture on an unprecedented scale, conspire to overwhelm present-day analysis approaches. We present here early experiences with a prototype exploratory data analysis environment, CONQUEST, designed to provide content-based access to such massive scientific datasets. CONQUEST (CONtent-based Querying in Space and Time) employs a combination of workstations and massively parallel processors (MPP's) to mine geophysical datasets possessing a prominent temporal component. It is designed to enable complex multi-modal interactive querying and knowledge discovery, while simultaneously coping with the extraordinary computational demands posed by the scope of the datasets involved. After outlining a working prototype, we concentrate here on the description of several associated feature extraction algorithms implemented on MPP platforms, together with some typical results.

CONQUEST shares a great deal in common with these systems.

Reference-contexts: Others are based upon the determination of local minima of the sea level pressure. We chose to implement a scheme based upon the detection of local minima, an approach developed in a reasonably sophisticated form in <ref> (Murray & Simmonds 1991) </ref>. This alternative was chosen because the latters' careful treatment includes the introduction of extra relevant information such as prevailing wind velocities in a meaningful way.

Reference-contexts: We modeled our blocking analysis operators after Nakamura and Wallace <ref> (Nakamura & Wallace 1990) </ref>. Blocking features are determined by measuring the difference between the geopotential height at a given time of year and the climatological mean at that time of year averaged over the entire time range of the dataset.

Reference-contexts: We have adapted a hierarchical clustering procedure that has been used in the atmospheric science literature <ref> (Cheng & Wallace 1993) </ref>, to a distributed farm of workstations. Our implementation uses publically available PVM message-passing software. The procedure used by Wallace seeks to cluster together many frames of a geophysical field of interest generated over time. <p> The resulting tree structure can be used to reduce the data dimensionality by identifying "cluster images" containing most of the important information. Many of the insights obtained correspond to similar observations that can be made on the basis of a somewhat more elaborate singular value decomposition analysis <ref> (Cheng & Wallace 1993) </ref>. Massively Parallel Feature Detection The algorithms described above for extracting cyclone and blocking features on a 10-year dataset of atmospheric data require several hours to execute on a typical scientific workstation.
