Abstract: We establish significantly improved bounds on the performance of the greedy algorithm for approximating set cover. In particular, we provide the first substantial improvement of the 20 year old classical harmonic upper bound, H(m), of Johnson, Lo-vasz, and Chvatal, by showing that the performance ratio of the greedy algorithm is, in fact, exactly ln m ln ln m + fi(1), where m is the size of the ground set. The difference between the upper and lower bounds turns out to be less than 1:1. This provides the first tight analysis of the greedy algorithm, as well as the first upper bound that lies below H(m) by a function going to infinity with m. We also show that the approximation guarantee for the greedy algorithm is better than the guarantee recently established by Srinivasan for the randomized rounding technique, thus improving the bounds on the integrality gap. Our improvements result from a new approach which might be generally useful for attacking other similar problems.

Reference-contexts: The only difference would be the definition of p-partial fractional cover, where we want the condition P fj j x2S j g t j 1 to hold for at least u = dpme points.

Petr Slavk, Set Cover, November 19, 1995 8 6 Conclusion Simple modification of our analysis to Halldorsson's "local improvements" algorithm shows that the performance ratio of this algorithm is also exactly ln m ln ln m + fi (m), with slightly better constants than in (16) and (17).

Reference-contexts: The arguments are little more subtle, but lead, essentially, to the same upper and lower bounds.

In this section we further improve our estimates and show that the performance guarantee of the greedy algorithm is better than that of the randomized rounding technique. <p> U we have X t j 1: Denote by c fl (T) the "cost" of the fractional cover T, i.e. c fl (T) = j=1 and let min = min c fl (T): This formulation is equivalent to the LP relaxation of the set cover problem considered by Srinivasan in <ref> [12] </ref>. Obviously, c fl min c min . Let us follow the steps in Section 3. Set l fl = c fl min .
