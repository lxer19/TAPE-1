Abstract: This paper reports on a continuing development of an abstract algebra course that was first implemented in the summer of 1990. This course was designed to address discrepancies between how students learn and how they were traditionally being taught. Based on results from the first implementation, pedagogical changes were made, including increased computer programming activities and other exercises which were designed to give the students the opportunity to build experience to draw on in order to construct understanding of the topics in class. A second experimental course was run. To assess the impact of these methods, and to continue to better understand how students go about learning, test results from the latter class and interviews with students from both experimental courses and a lecture-based class were analyzed. The students in the second experimental course demonstrated a deep understanding of the title concepts, especially cosets and normality. We discuss the details of the revised experimental course; the epistomological theory behind its design; and the framework used to analyze the results. We demonstrate through examples from interviews and test results the applicability of this analysis to the data, and the strides made by the students in comparison with the students from the lecture-based course, and with the students from the first experimental course. We hope to illustrate difficulties students face in learning abstract algebra, and to discuss instructional strategies to help students overcome these difficulties.

Reference-contexts: An indication of the former might be obtained from their responses to the next question on the exam. A response that was more likely to indicate that a student was thinking about a group only in terms of its underlying set <ref> (a difficulty which is discussed in Brown et al., 1996) </ref> was one in which the student formed the set of cosets and gave no more on the problem, apparently considering that this sufficed as an identification of the quotient group. 40 There were several responses that were erroneous (as opposed to <p> showed some concern with g and one gave an essentially correct definition 3 . 8.3 Quotient groups The quality of understanding of quotient groups by these students is different from what we have observed for cosets and normality as well as the concepts studied in related papers from this data <ref> (Asiala et al., 1996, Brown et al., 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An early example of this was described in 1976 by Gallian where students participated in projects using computer programs written in Fortran to investigate finite groups. More recently, specialized software such as Exploring Small Groups <ref> (Geissinger, 1989) </ref> and CAYLEY (O'Bryan & Sherman, 1992) have been developed and used as computing environments for student experimentation in abstract algebra. Additionally, less specialized software packages such as MATLAB have recently been reported as useful for computing in abstract algebra, see for example Makiw (1996).

Reference-contexts: That is, these students mention only the set in describing the quotient, but in their work they show that they are quite aware of and can compute successfully with the operation. This could be an example of success coming before understanding <ref> (Piaget, 1978) </ref>. One other response was to mention the set and operation but to compute the Cayley table incorrectly. Some students listed the elements of the quotient incorrectly. Two simply listed the representatives without the subgroup.
