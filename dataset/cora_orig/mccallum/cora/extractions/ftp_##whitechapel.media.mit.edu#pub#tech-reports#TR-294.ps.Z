Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 294 November 1994. Abbreviated version appears in ICCV '95. Abstract A new approach to tracking weakly modeled objects in a semantically rich domain is presented. We refer to our method as closed-world tracking. A closed-world is a space-time region of an image sequence in which the complete taxonomy of objects is known and in which all pixels can be explained as belonging to one of those objects. Given object information (and additional contextual information if available) context-specific features can be dynamically selected as the basis for tracking. A context-specific feature is one that has been chosen based upon the context to maximize the chance of successful tracking between frames. Our work is motivated by the goal of video annotation the semi-automatic generation of symbolic descriptions of action taking place in a dynamic scene. Common tracking techniques such as correlation, adaptive-templates, and de-formable models typically fail in situations where it is difficult to syntactically isolate an object (e.g. background subtraction), where the shape of an object may change dramatically from frame to frame, and where the behavior of an object is not smooth or predictable. We test our algorithm in the "football domain," a real video-annotation domain currently being annotated manually. We describe how closed-world analysis and context-specific tracking can be applied to tracking football players and present the details of our implementation. We include tracking results based on hundreds of images that demonstrate the wide range of tracking situations the algorithm will successfully handle as well as a few examples of where the algorithm fails.

Reference-contexts: Toal's work touches on the idea that non-geometric information can be used to improve vehicle tracking [31]. Vehicles are constrained in different ways depending upon their environment, and Toal has suggested that this information might be used in a video understanding system. Allen's bird counting system <ref> [1] </ref> illustrates that recognizing the same type of objects (birds) or the same type of object two different context (grounded and flying auklets) may require two entirely different vision methods.

Reference-contexts: The coach COACH system uses plan creation to analyze football plays and generate new ones [7].

The REPLAI system uses the events recovered by SOCCER to estimate the intention of the player actions [22]. All three of these systems use manually generated trajectory input.

Reference-contexts: Other field markings (such as the mid-field decal) are completely arbitrary. While there may is no simple way to obtain an exact geometrical specification of these objects, it is possible from the football video to reconstruct approximate pixel-based models for the given field (details available in <ref> [12] </ref>). Examples are shown in Figure 6. But such models contain errors such as the flat bottom and top of the zero, the exact shape of the numbers, and the poor helmet resolution. Another approximate model is the field turf. Using histogramming, a turf intensity range can be estimated. <p> This is simple to do using a homographic transform (perspective four-point transform) as illustrated in Figure 9. This rectification was achieved automatically by tracking many line intersections and computing a least squares solution. Details can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. One result of the rectification is that camera motion is removed, giving the appearance of a stationary camera and background. When viewing such imagery one is inclined to believe that it is possible to perform simple background subtraction as a means of isolating the players. <p> If no motion blob exists in the region around player, the player is assumed to be static and the player's previous closed-world is used at the current frame. For the details of the motion based closed-world region finding algorithm, see <ref> [12] </ref>. 8 The geometrical objects (i.e. lines) are modeled precisely.

The theory is developed and examples are drawn from the football domain.

Reference-contexts: The closed-worlds yield independent interpretation problems greatly reducing the order of interaction that needs to be considered.

Reference-contexts: Space-time tracking methods require strong camera or object motion models that are not available in our current domain [19]. Finally, there are model-based tracking techniques that use geometrical models of rigid objects combined with a recursive motion estimators <ref> [16, 14, 34, 15, 30] </ref>. Clearly, tasks like tracking football players, or, say, cells in a microscopic image do not easily fit within these 3D matching frameworks. The use of high-level domain knowledge is not widespread in the tracking literature.

Reference-contexts: As we show in section 4.6, a simple adaptive tracker fails for the football player tracking task. Energy-based deformable models have been used to improve adaptive tracking <ref> [5, 35] </ref> by requiring the template to vary slowly or smoothly. Typically using such models requires good support from the data, necessitating high resolution. Also such models do not help to reason about occlusion, a non-smooth shape varying process.
