Abstract: Commitments are crucial to understanding and designing autonomous agents and multiagent systems. We propose a definition of commitments that applies especially well to agents in information-rich applications, such as electronic commerce and virtual enterprises. Our approach has a number of important features, including not gratuitously translating social concepts to psychological concepts distinguishing between satisfied and inapplicable commitments incorporating social policies to handle the creation, satisfaction, and

Reference-contexts: Failure recovery is typically achieved by compensating the subtransactions that erroneously recorded success (even though other related transactions did not)|the compensations are of course domain-specific.

Reference-contexts: Modern DB applications, which involve heterogeneity, flexibility, and human collaboration, do not fit the traditional mold. Some of these applications have been addressed using agent-based techniques, e.g., [ Wittig, 1992; Singh & Huhns, 1994 ] ; others with advanced database techniques, e.g., <ref> [ Bukhres & Elmagarmid, 1996 ] </ref> ; and still others by combining in organizational techniques, e.g., [ Papazoglou et al., 1992 ] . The DB and DAI strands of research into commitments have progressed without much cross-fertilization. <p> On the one hand, DTMSs can be given a knowledge-level characterization in terms of commitments; on the other hand, they can be used to implement some of the reasoning required in maintaining commitments. DB and Groupware Approaches. A number of extended transaction models have been proposed, e.g., <ref> [ Bukhres & Elmagarmid, 1996 ] </ref> . The extended transaction models allow partial results to be released, and then attempt to restore consistency through actions to compensate for the effects of erroneously completed actions. Some workflow scheduling approaches exist that provide functionality to capture control flow among tasks.

Castelfranchi distinguishes a notion of collective commitment, which is subsumed by our concept of commitment (through the orthogonal representation of the structure of multiagent systems).

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is known that in settings with asynchronous, unreliable or unboundedly delayable communication, mutual beliefs can be obtained only if they are there from the start|i.e., the mutual beliefs are the invariants of the system <ref> [ Chandy & Misra, 1986 ] </ref> . We conjecture that named groups and named commitments, which are reminiscent of contract numbers in business dealings, provide the necessary connections among the agents.

Reference-contexts: SoCs, which were proposed about two decades ago <ref> [ Davies, 1978 ] </ref> , capture some of the same intuitions as the extended transaction models.

Reference-contexts: For example, the seller role presupposes that the seller will respond to requests for price quotes, and honor its quotes. The abstract CISs are instantiated with concrete agents filling each role. The concrete agents may be individuals or groups. Recalling <ref> [ Gasser, 1991 ] </ref> , a concrete agent may fill in more than one role in an abstract CIS, and participate in more than one abstract CIS concurrently. The act of joining a CIS corresponds to creating commitments. The commitments associated with a role are schematic. <p> The underlying means of execution is based on a temporal logic approach, which extends the results of [ Singh, 1996b ] , to provide primitives for coordinating heterogeneous activities. 4 Comparisons with the Literature DAI Approaches.

Reference-contexts: To avoid terminological confusion, we use the term "succeed" instead of the database term "commit" where only the success of an individual transaction is implied. 2.1 Traditional Database Transactions Traditional transactions are computations that satisfy a number of useful properties, in particular the so-called ACID properties <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993 ] </ref> . - atomicity: all or none of a transaction happens consistency: a transaction preserves the consistency of the database isolation: intermediate results of a transaction are not visible externally durability: when a transaction concludes successfully, its effects are perma nent. <p> SoCs, which were proposed about two decades ago [ Davies, 1978 ] , capture some of the same intuitions as the extended transaction models. The database community is seeing a resurgence of interest in SoCs as the limitations of traditional transactions are being realized <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993, pp. 174-180 ] </ref> . Intuitively, SoCs attempt to contain the effects of an action as long as there might be a necessity to undo them. Ordinarily, a result is released only when it is established that it is correct (and will remain correct).

Reference-contexts: It would be better to undo and rerun both val and hos before notifying the customer, than to notify the customer about each subtransaction individually.

They do not have an explicit construct for commitments, but postulate mutual beliefs among the committing agents.

Reference-contexts: Further, it hardwires a specific approach to canceling commitments (for joint intentions)|the participating agents must achieve a mutual belief that the given commitment has been canceled.

Thus, he can generalize on [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] . <p> However, for teams, he requires a "minimum" convention, which recalls the approach of [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] . Jennings also requires a mental state as concomitant with a joint commitment. While we share many of the intuitions and motivations of <ref> [ Jennings, 1993 ] </ref> (including applications involving heterogeneous information systems), we attain greater generality through the explicit use of the structure of multiagent systems. The agents always enter into commitments in the context of their multiagent system, and sometimes to that system.
