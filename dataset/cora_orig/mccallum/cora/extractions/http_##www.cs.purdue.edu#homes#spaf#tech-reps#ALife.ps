Title: Computer Viruses as Artificial Life  
Author: Eugene H. Spafford

Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences Purdue University  
Abstract: There has been considerable interest in computer viruses since they first appeared in 1981, and especially in the past few years as they have reached epidemic numbers in many personal computer environments. Viruses have been written about as a security problem, as a social problem, and as a possible means of performing useful tasks in a distributed computing environment. However, only recently have some scientists begun to ask if computer viruses are not a form of artificial life a self-replicating organism. Simply because computer viruses do not exist as organic molecules may not be sufficient reason to dismiss the classification of this form of vandalware as a form of life. This paper begins with a description of how computer viruses operate and their history, and of the various ways computer viruses are structured. It then examines how viruses meet properties associated with life as defined by some researchers in the area of artificial life and self-organizing systems. The paper concludes with some comments directed towards the definition of artificially alive systems and experimentation.

Reference-contexts: Although Cohen (and others, including Len Adleman <ref> [1] </ref>) have attempted formal definitions of computer virus, none have gained widespread acceptance or use. This is a result of the difficulty in defining precisely the characteristics of what a virus is and is not. Cohen's formal definition includes any programs capable of self-reproduction.

Reference-contexts: Mainframe viruses may be written for any operating system that supports sharing of data and executable software, but all reported to date have been experimental in nature, written by serious academic researchers in controlled environments (e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>). This is probably a result, in part, of the greater restrictions built into the software and hardware of those machines, and of the way they are usually used.

Reference-contexts: The Internet Worm of November 1988 is often cited as the canonical example of a damaging worm program.[26, 27, 22] The Worm clogged machines and networks as it spread out of control, replicating on thousands of machines around the Internet. Some authors (e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>) labeled the Internet Worm as a virus, but those arguments are not convincing (cf. the discussion in [25]). Most people working with self-replicating code now accept the Worm as a form of software distinct from computer viruses.

Reference-contexts: The first, and obvious, question is What is life? Without an answer to this question, we will be unable to say if a computer virus is alive. One very reasonable list of properties associated with life was presented in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Computers are designed to execute instructions one after another. <p> Each new class of viruses has incorporated new features that make the viruses more difficult to detect and remove. Here, as with other classification and naming issues related to viruses, different researchers use different terms and definitions (cf. <ref> [9, Appendix 10] </ref>). The following list presents one classification derived from a number of these sources. Note that these generations do not necessarily imply chronology. For instance, several early viruses (e.g., the Brain and Pentagon viruses) had stealth and armored characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Worms have also appeared in other science fiction literature. Recent cyberpunk novels such as Neuromancer by William Gibson <ref> [13] </ref> refer to worms by the term virus. The media has also often referred incorrectly to worms as viruses. This paper focuses only on viruses as defined above. Many of the comments about viruses and artificial life may also be applied to worm programs.

In particular, they have flourished in the weaker security environment of the personal computer.

Reference-contexts: A further disadvantage is that polymorphic viruses cannot be detected with scanners. To the advantage of scanners, however, is their speed. Scanning can be made to work quite quickly. Scanning can also be done portably and across platforms, <ref> [17] </ref>, and pattern files are easy to distribute and update. Furthermore, of the new viruses discovered each week, few will ever become widespread. Thus, somewhat out-of-date pattern files are still adequate for most environments. Scanners equipped with algorithmic or heuristic checking may also find most polymorphic viruses.

Reference-contexts: Other forms of self-reproducing and usually malicious software have also been written. Although no formal definitions have been accepted by the entire community to describe this software, there are some informal definitions that seem to be commonly accepted (cf. <ref> [21] </ref>). Several of these are often discussed by analogy to living organisms. This tendency towards anthropomorphism has perhaps led to some confusion about the nature of this software.

Computers are designed to execute instructions one after another. Those instructions usually do something useful calculate values, maintain databases, and communicate with users and with other systems. <p> The replacement may also be extensive, as when large portions of the host program are completely replaced by the viral code. In the latter case, the original program can no longer function properly. Few viruses are intrusive viruses. 6 A second form of classification used by some authors (e.g., <ref> [24] </ref>) is to divide viruses into file infectors and boot (system startup) program infectors. This is not particularly clear, however, as there are viruses that spread by altering system-related code that is neither boot code nor programs. Some viruses target file system directories, for example.
