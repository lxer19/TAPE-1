Abstract: Evolution as a metaphor borrowed from nature can be used to describe a design process. However, this has generally been applied to the evolution of a solution which assumes the problem does not change throughout the process. This is a naive assumption in design because the problem indeed changes. This paper considers the evolution of both the problem and solution and introduces co-evolutionary design. This paper proposes two approaches to implementing co-evolutionary design and also addresses the related issues of evaluation and termination in a computational model. Finally, the paper considers how a coevolutionary system can generate and recognize emergent structure and behaviour.

Reference-contexts: The view of design as state-space search has dominated the research direction of the AI-in-Design community for some time. This is an attractive assumption because what is once a complex human activity is reduced to a relatively manageable computing task. However, this simplified view faces a lot of challenges <ref> (Corne, Smithers & Ross 1994) </ref>, (Gero 1994), (Maher & Poon 1996). The major criticism is on the assumption that a problem is defined once-and-for-all. This is definitely not true for design.

Reference-contexts: Emergence is an important research issue in biology as well as in creative design.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Nature gives inspiration to research scientists. She is used to model both the evolutionary characteristics of a design process and to provide a framework for the development of computational methods, e.g. genetic algorithms <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref>, evolutionary programming (Fogel, Owens & Walsh 1966) etc. Therefore, it seems appropriate to implement a nature-inspired design process with a nature-inspired computational paradigm. In section 2, co-evolutionary design is introduced where the assumption of having a fixed goal (problem) is removed.

Reference-contexts: The co-evolution of the design genes (solution space) and the fitness function (beha-viour space) can be implemented with the following two approaches: (i) CoGA1: Combined Gene Approach A single composite genotype is formed by the combination of an expected behaviour and a design solution <ref> (Maher & Poon 1995) </ref>. Since the fitness function is defined locally for each design solution, the measurement of a phenotype represents a local fitness value. Because of the unique representation, the basic GA is modified to have two phases in each generation. <p> This demonstrates that our goal of exploration as a change in focus during the design process occurred through the rise and fall of the proportion of the population that used each design focus. More detailed discussion of this experiment can be found in <ref> (Maher & Poon 1995) </ref>. The other experiment is on emergence when a floor plan is designed. To design a floor plan encompasses two tasks: to draw a configuration of lines with spaces to represent walls and rooms, and to specify the usage of each of the spaces.

However, this simplified view faces a lot of challenges (Corne, Smithers & Ross 1994), (Gero 1994), <ref> (Maher & Poon 1996) </ref>. The major criticism is on the assumption that a problem is defined once-and-for-all. This is definitely not true for design. <p> This approach can be viewed as a tightly-coupled, or a host-parasite, co-evolution where each parasite tries to adapt to a specific host. (ii) CoGA2: Interacting Population Approach Two spaces are modelled as two sets of genotypes and phenotypes: one for modelling expected behaviour and one for modelling design solutions <ref> (Maher & Poon 1996) </ref>. Hence, fitness of individuals in the population of the problem requirements and population of design solutions is evaluated alternatively, i.e. one generation will have behaviours being evaluated and the other generation will have the structures evaluated. <p> The best beha-viour phenotype is identified as the CBB (current best behaviour). The CBB serves as part of the evaluation function with R init for the structure space in the next generation. Emergence of behaviour and structure is integrated to co-evolutionary design <ref> (Poon & Maher 1996) </ref>. The evolved (emerging) genes can become more complex in each generation as an evolved gene may be composed of another evolved gene, thus, this is a kind of hierarchical structure of emerging genes. 10 Fig. 3.
