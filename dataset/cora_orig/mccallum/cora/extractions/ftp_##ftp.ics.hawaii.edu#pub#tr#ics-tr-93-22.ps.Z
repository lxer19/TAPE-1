Abstract: Usenet is an example of the potential and problems of the nascent National Information Infrastructure. While Usenet makes an enormous amount of useful information available to its users, the daily data overwhelms any user who tries to read more than a fraction of it. This paper presents a collaboration-oriented approach to information classification and evaluation for very large, dynamic database structures such as Usenet. Our approach is implemented in a system called URN, a multi-user, collaborative, hypertextual Usenet reader. We show that this collaborative method, coupled with an adaptive interface, radically improves the overall relevance level of information presented to a user.

Reference-contexts: The global frequency of a keyword is the number of times it appeared in the whole database. By taking the product of the local frequency with the inverse of the global frequency, URN generates higher weights for rare words, and lower weights for more ubiquitous words <ref> [1] </ref>. For each keyword in the badlist, URN computes a weight using the following formula: W b = f l f g 8 where the variables are defined similarly to W g .

Reference-contexts: As of March 1993, an estimated 76,000 Usenet sites existed with a total of over 2.4 million Usenet users [10]. In the two week period from January 10, 1994 to January 24, 1994, users generated over a gigabyte of data, consisting of approximately 673,000 separate articles <ref> [2] </ref>. Syntactic Structure of Usenet Usenet articles are categorized into thousands of `news groups' (almost 9000 newsgroups exist as of January 24, 1994 [2]). Newsgroup membership is the primary way to classify articles by subject area. Newsgroups are hierarchically named where `.' separates the levels of hierarchy. <p> In the two week period from January 10, 1994 to January 24, 1994, users generated over a gigabyte of data, consisting of approximately 673,000 separate articles <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It also provides a graphical user interface for browsing through the Usenet hierarchy. Because it derives all its information about articles through the header lines, it cannot determine that a thread's contents have changed from the actual Subject line. Tapestry. This collaborative document filtering tool <ref> [4] </ref> contains a complex query language (TQL) which users can use to write their own queries. Filters written in TQL can access "annotations" or "endorsements" created by other users in order to filter a message. These endorsements are similar to votes in URN, and allow for "virtual moderation" of newsgroups.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Information is rapidly becoming the essential currency of the modern world. With the growth of global connectivity, there is a growing desire to not only receive information, but to distribute one's own information. In the United States, there are proposals for a "National Information Infrastructure" <ref> [5] </ref> to enable its citizens to participate in the information age. However, there already exists a tremendously successful network allowing millions of people to send and receive information on a global scale. This network is Usenet. Usenet is a global collaborative system par excellence.

Reference-contexts: Having now overviewed the essential requirements and major design features of URN, the next section presents details of its implementation. Implementation URN is implemented using Egret, a Unix/X-window environment for the implementation of exploratory collaborative hypertext applications <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Egret consists of a 20 KLOC server process written in C++, which communicates via TCP/IP to Lucid Emacs clients extended with 15 KLOC of Lisp. The URN application specializes Egret to Usenet with approximately four additional KLOC of Lisp.

Reference-contexts: The URN application specializes Egret to Usenet with approximately four additional KLOC of Lisp. Inputting Articles URN keeps its own database of Usenet articles. Articles are read into the URN database periodically by an agent process via the NNTP protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. As it reads in each article, keywords are extracted from the header of the article. The header fields Subject, Summary, Author, and Keywords from the original article are parsed into separate words.

Reference-contexts: Often when using the system, users wished that they could indicate a stronger preference than the binary interesting or uninteresting provided. Research in psychology suggests that subjects can give meaningful feedback with up to a 7 point rating scale <ref> [9] </ref>, which could easily be implemented in a future version of URN. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS This paper presents URN, a system for collaborative classification and evaluation of Usenet.

Reference-contexts: Kill files only provide a structure for users to list patterns that exclude everything that they do not like, when it is easier for users to think about patterns that they do like. * Kill files are brittle. Finally, kill files are difficult to create and maintain <ref> [11] </ref>. It is difficult, for example, to know when to take a inappropriate pattern off the list, since the user will not see the interesting articles deleted by the kill file.

Reference-contexts: However, even in small like-minded groups, users may have widely varying representations about the structure of a textual artifact <ref> [12] </ref>. In this usage we did not encounter any serious problems, but it must be considered in any longer term experiment. Users expressed a desire to be able to give URN a wider range of feedback on an article.
