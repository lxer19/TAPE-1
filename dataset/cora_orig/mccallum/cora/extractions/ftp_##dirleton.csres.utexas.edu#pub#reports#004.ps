Reference-contexts: The Gypsy Verification Environment has evolved over a period of ten years. It's predecessor, jointly developed by USC Information Sciences Institute and The University of Texas, is described in [Good 75]. Various aspects of the GVE are described in <ref> [Moriconi 77, Hare 79, Smith 80, Akers 83] </ref>. Some of the notable successes of the Gypsy effort are described in [DiVito 81, DiVito 82, Good 82, Siebert 84, Good 84]. 2.3 Proof of Concurrent Programs Owicki and Gries [Owicki 75, Owicki 76] handle concurrent programs with globally shared variables.
