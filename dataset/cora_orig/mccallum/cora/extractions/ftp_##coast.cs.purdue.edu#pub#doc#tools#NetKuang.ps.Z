Title: NetKuang A Multi-Host Configuration Vulnerability Checker  
Author: Dan Zerkle and Karl Levitt

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of California at  
Abstract: NetKuang is an extension to Baldwin's SU-Kuang. It runs on networks of computers using Unix and can find vulnerabilities created by poor system configuration. Vulnerabilities are discovered using a backwards goal-based search that is breadth-first on individual hosts and parallel when multiple hosts are checked. An implementation in C++ found real vulnerabilities on production systems. Tests show reasonably fast performance on an LAN.

Reference-contexts: Given that is very likely that an administrator will make mistakes in configuring his system and that many of these mistakes can leave the system open to easy attack, these tools have been widely used as a preventive measure. The Computer Oracle Password and Security System (COPS) <ref> [1] </ref>, uses a set of shell scripts to check for likely misconfigurations in a Unix system. Among its simple but important checks are the permission modes of security-relevant files and directories, such as /etc/passwd and /etc/group. COPS also determines if set user-ID root files are world-writable.

Reference-contexts: Among its simple but important checks are the permission modes of security-relevant files and directories, such as /etc/passwd and /etc/group. COPS also determines if set user-ID root files are world-writable. The SU-Kuang system <ref> [2] </ref> is a rule-based expert system for checking the security of a Unix file system's configuration. The rule base captures approaches by which an attacker can extend his privileges by making system calls. <p> The Security Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks (SATAN) [5] and the Internet Scanner [6] both scan networks to find vulnerable hosts. They can look for such suspicious states as use of faulty versions of network software and improper NFS exports. 3 NetKuang Netkuang is based on Baldwin's SU-Kuang <ref> [2] </ref>, It has all the functionality of SU-Kuang, but also addresses the concerns of a networked environment. It is capable of searching a large number of hosts in parallel, and it also considers potential configuration vulnerabilities present in a networked environment.

Reference-contexts: Although very effective for single host Unix systems, it does not work on a network of Unix systems. The Miro security constraint file checking system <ref> [3] </ref> checks a file system against a set of specified con 1 straints that define legal configurations of the sys-tem. Security constraints are specified as graphs, and the system administrator uses a graphical editor to create and modify graphs.

Reference-contexts: Security constraints are specified as graphs, and the system administrator uses a graphical editor to create and modify graphs. A constraint checker determines if the graphs are consistent with the policy. Tripwire <ref> [4] </ref>, the widely used file integrity checker, is used to determine if critical files have been modified.

Reference-contexts: In Tripwire, a cryptographic checksum is computed for each file, and the original checksum is compared periodically with that for the current version of the file. The Security Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks (SATAN) <ref> [5] </ref> and the Internet Scanner [6] both scan networks to find vulnerable hosts.

Reference-contexts: It is capable of searching a large number of hosts in parallel, and it also considers potential configuration vulnerabilities present in a networked environment. NetKuang and SU-Kuang are named after a fictional piece of security-breaking software in William Gibson's novel, Neuromancer <ref> [7] </ref>. 3.1 Functionality An example will best illustrate the kind of problem that NetKuang can find. Consider a user Sandy, who is logged into a Unix machine named apricot.
