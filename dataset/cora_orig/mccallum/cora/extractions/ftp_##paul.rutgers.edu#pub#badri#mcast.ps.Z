Abstract: To appear in the 13 th Intl. Conf. on Distributed Computing Systems, May '93 aa Delivering Multicast Messages in Networks with Mobile Hosts Arup Acharya B. R. Badrinath Department of Computer Science Rutgers University ---acharya@riches, badri@cs.rutgers.edu Abstract There is a strong trend towards integrating portable computers within existing data networks. Traditional network protocols were designed assuming a static view of network connectivity. A mobile host can connect to the network from different locations at different times. This has led to the emergence of a new set of problems with regard to addressing schemes and network protocols for accommodating mobility within existing networks. This paper presents a protocol for delivering a multicast message exactly once to a group of mobile destinations. The protocol is based on a system model derived from an architecture developed in [5] for mobile internetworking, relying on mobile support stations within the fixed network to communicate with mobile hosts. 1. Introduction There has been considerable interest recently to extend data networks to handle mobility with the aim of providing continuous network connectivity to mobile hosts in spite of a change in their location. To handle mobile hosts, the fixed network is augmented with mobile support stations/base stations that act as access points to the fixed network for the mobile hosts. Research on the necessary software support required to handle mobility has focussed on addressing schemes and routing [5, 2, 7, 9], distributed file systems for mobile clients [8, 6] and handling database queries in mobile distributed environments [4]. So far, the work on addressing schemes and routing for mobile hosts has concentrated on how to assign addresses to mobile hosts so that IP-based protocols may be used for routing messages to a single mobile host. Using an abstract model of the architecture developed in [5] for mobile internetworking, this paper presents a protocol for efficiently multicasting a message to multiple mobile destinations. The MCAST protocol presented here, ensures that a multicast message will be delivered to a mobile destination exactly once even though it may move a 1 This work was supported in part by the NSF under grant IRI-90101174 and is a component of the DATAMAN project at Rutgers, which addresses issues of data management in wireless mobile computing. Briefly, the architecture presented in [5] for mobile in-ternetworking is as follows. The term mobile implies able to move while retaining its network connections [5]. A host that can move while retaining its network connections is a mobile host (MH). The infrastructure machines that communicate directly with the mobile hosts are called mobile support stations(MSS). Acell is a logical or geographical coverage area under a MSS. All MHs that have identified themselves with a particular MSS as belonging to its cell, are considered to be local to the MSS. A MH can directly communicate with a MSS (and vice versa) only if the MH is physically located within the cell serviced by the MSS. To communicate a datagram to another MH that is not in the same cell, the source MH contacts its local MSS which forwards the datagram to the local MSS of the target MH over the wired network. The receiving MSS then transmits the message over the wireless network to the target MH. At any given instant of time, a MH may belong to only one cell. The MSS beacon protocol is executed whenever a MH moves to a new cell. Addressing schemes for mobile hosts and routing protocols for (unreliable) delivery of point-to-point messages are presented in [5]. The system model that we use in this paper (Fig. 1), is derived from the architecture of [5] described above. This model consists of two distinct sets of entities: a large number of mobile hosts and a set of fixed hosts, some of which act as mobile support stations. Each MSS is capable of directly communicating with mobile hosts located within its cell via a wireless medium. All fixed hosts and the communication paths between them constitute the static/fixed network. Each MSS and the local MHs within its cell form a wireless network. Thus, based on the architecture of [5], our model consists of a static network along with a wireless network attached to each MSS that allows direct communication between a MSS and the MHs located within its cell. However, our system model diverges from the architecture of [5] by assuming that the fixed network guarantees reliable,

Reference-contexts: The MCAST protocol requires the initiator to contact every MSS. Reliable communication between the initiator and other MSSs can be implemented on top of best-effort multicast routing protocols for static-host groups, such as <ref> [3] </ref>. From a scalability standpoint, MCAST is intended for delivering multicast messages to mobile hosts within a single campus and needs to be suitably modified for inter-campus operation. 6. <p> It was shown that mobility of hosts coupled with network latency, introduce a new dimension to the problem of reliably delivering mul-ticast messages without duplication, even in the absence of failures.
