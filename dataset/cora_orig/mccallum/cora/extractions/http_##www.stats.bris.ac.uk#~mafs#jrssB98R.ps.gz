Abstract: We discuss a Bayesian formalism which gives rise to a type of wavelet threshold estimation in non-parametric regression. A prior distribution is imposed on the wavelet coefficients of the unknown response function, designed to capture the sparseness of wavelet expansion common to most applications. For the prior specified, the posterior median yields a thresholding procedure. Our prior model for the underlying function can be adjusted to give functions falling in any specific Besov space. We establish a relation between the hyperparameters of the prior model and the parameters of those Besov spaces within which realizations from the prior will fall. Such a relation gives insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters. Moreover, the established relation makes it possible in principle to incorporate prior knowledge about the function's regularity properties into the prior model for its wavelet coefficients. However, prior knowledge about a function's regularity properties might be hard to elicit; with this in mind, we propose a standard choise of prior hyperparameters that works well in our examples. Several simulated examples are used to illustrate our method, and comparisons are made with other thresholding methods. We also present an application to a data set collected in an anaesthesiological study.

Reference-contexts: This is, perhaps, not surprising, since the original idea of the False Discovery Rate has a natural interpretation as a hard thresholding procedure <ref> (see Abramovich & Benjamini, 1995, 1996) </ref>. Within the BayesThresh approach, the effect of varying ff and fi was investigated. For all four functions, reducing fi gave worse results, especially for the Blocks and Doppler functions. This is as might be expected given the irregularity of these functions.

Reference-contexts: The choice of thresholding rule, therefore, becomes a crucial step in the estimation procedure. Several approaches to thresholding have been introduced in the literature: a minimax approach <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994, 1995) </ref>, multiple hypothesis testing (Abramovich & Benjamini, 1995, 1996; Ogden & Parzen, 1996a, 1996b), cross-validation (Nason, 1995, 1996; Weyrich & Warhola, 1995). <p> The hard thresholding is a `keep' or `kill' rule, while the soft thresholding is a `shrink' or `kill' rule. In applications, hard thresholding generally reproduces peak heights and discontinuities better, but at some cost in visual smoothness <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone 1994, 1995) </ref>. <p> Apply the VisuShrink threshold DJ = 2 log (n). When the noise level is unknown, it is robustly estimated by the median absolute deviation of the wavelet coefficients at the finest level, divided by 0.6745 <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994) </ref>. By the construction of this thresholding rule, the probability that even one negligible coefficient will pass the threshold tends to zero (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994), so essentially only non-negligible ^ d jk will survive after thresholding. <p> the noise level is unknown, it is robustly estimated by the median absolute deviation of the wavelet coefficients at the finest level, divided by 0.6745 <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994) </ref>. By the construction of this thresholding rule, the probability that even one negligible coefficient will pass the threshold tends to zero (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994), so essentially only non-negligible ^ d jk will survive after thresholding. Suppose that, on level j, the number of coefficients that pass DJ is M j , and that the values of these coefficients are x j1 ; : : : ; x jM j . <p> The values of were taken to correspond to values 10, 7, 5 and 3 for the root signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) f R 1 where g = R 1 We compare BayesThresh with several wavelet-based estimators for reconstructing the original functions: VisuShrink <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994) </ref>, Glob-alSure (a modified version of the SureShrink of Donoho & Johnstone, 1995, considered in Nason, 1996), Cross-validation (Nason, 1995; 1996) and False Discovery Rate (Abramovich & Benjamini, 1995; 1996). <p> Therefore, we consider ff = 0:5, 1 and 2, and estimate C 1 and C 2 as suggested in Section 4.4. The noise level is robustly estimated by the median absolute deviation of the wavelet coefficients at the finest level, divided 16 by 0.6745 <ref> (Donoho & Johnstone, 1994) </ref>. Figures 9 and 10 show a section of plethysmograph recording lasting approximately 80 seconds (4096 data points) together with various reconstructions. The two main sets of regular oscillations correspond to normal breathing.

Reference-contexts: Several data-driven thresholding rules have been developed recently. Donoho & Johnstone (1995) proposed a SureShrink thresholding which is based on minimizing Stein's unbiased risk estimate <ref> (Stein, 1981) </ref> and will usually yield smaller thresholds than the VisuShrink method. They have shown that SureShrink is also asymptotically near-minimax and the computational effort of the overall procedure is O (n log (n)). For a practical demonstration of the advantages of this approach see Johnstone & Silverman (1997).

Reference-contexts: As we shall show below, such L 1 rules (posterior medians) are of thresholding type. Another possible way to obtain a thresholding rule within a Bayesian framework is via hypothesis testing ideas <ref> (Vidakovic, 1994) </ref>. The posterior cumulative distribution function of d jk j ^ d jk corresponding to (7) has a jump at zero.
