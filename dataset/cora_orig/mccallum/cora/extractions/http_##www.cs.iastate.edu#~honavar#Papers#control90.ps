Title: Coordination and Control Structures and Processes: Possibilities for Connectionist Networks (CN)  
Author: Vasant Honavar Leonard Uhr 
Affiliation: Computer Sciences Department University of Wisconsin-Madison  
Abstract: The absence of powerful control structures and processes that synchronize, coordinate, switch between, choose among, regulate, direct, modulate interactions between, and combine distinct yet interdependent modules of large connectionist networks (CN) is probably one of the most important reasons why such networks have not yet succeeded at handling difficult tasks (e.g. complex object recognition and description, complex problem-solving, planning). In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways. We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations, and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones; the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost.

Reference-contexts: The sequence of state transitions that actually take place is tightly controlled by the so called control genes which can turn on or off other genes (even whole sets of genes) through the action of gene activator proteins and gene repressor proteins <ref> (Alberts, et al., 1983) </ref>. Local DNA sequences may also be reversibly rearranged to turn genes on and off, thus producing alternating patterns of gene activity. Generation of specialized cells from less specialized ancestors is a central feature of development. <p> Major, but Dispersed Control: Cellular Functions- Metabolism, Cell-to-Cell Communication, Immune System A variety of proteins found on the surface of cell membranes play a crucial role in cell to cell recognition and adhesion <ref> (Alberts et al., 1983) </ref>. Other proteins that lie within or across the membrane serve as carriers of chemical messages, and receptors for neuro-transmitter molecules (and hence recognizers of messages), among other things. <p> The potential for powerful signalling built into these transport mechanisms is quite enormous. Cells of the immune system are sophisticated recognizers of chemical messages <ref> (Alberts et al., 1983) </ref>. These cells, called the lymphocytes, serve to defend the animal against foreign microorganisms that may have invaded it. The lymphocytes produce specific antibodies that selectively bind to particular molecules on the surface of the invading microorganisms or on the toxic molecules that they produce.

Reference-contexts: Such a shifter mechanism is consistent with the known anatomy and physiology of the primate visual pathway, and offers a possible explanation for the existence of the surprisingly large number of cells in the geniculo-recipient layers of the primary visual cortex <ref> (Anderson & Van Essen, 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Other topologies are occasionally used, including near-neighbor converging tree-like connectivity from one layer to the next (Honavar & Uhr, 1987; 1988; 1989; 1990a), structures that expedite the particular functions computed, e.g., Hough transforms <ref> (Ballard, 1984) </ref>, and structures (e.g., arrays, trees, pipelines) that are built in because they appear to be appropriate for the particular type of problem being attacked. When the nodes in CN are structured into arrays, pipelines, trees, pyramids, etc., the connectivity thus established can serve important coordination and control functions.

Reference-contexts: Pipeline stages can be used to introduce the desired amounts of delay so that information flowing through multiple pipelines can be synchronized or combined as necessary. Relatively Loose, Dispersed Control: Biological Evolution Many people think of biological evolution as a large number of independent individuals moving toward structured complexities <ref> (see Bonner, 1988 for an elaboration of this view) </ref>. It has been argued that evolution is a natural and necessary conseqence of biological information systems (e.g., genetic systems, chromosomal organization, cytoplasmic organization) obeying the second law of thermodynamics (Brooks and Wiley, 1988). <p> But control is by no means entirely dispersed, residing only in each individual. A crucial component is the larger environment's nurturing rewards, debilitating punishments, and niches that invite filling <ref> (Bonner, 1988) </ref>. The generation of complex self-organizing populations requires mechanisms that expand the combinatorial space in which genetic recombination and reproduction can take place.

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that evolution is a natural and necessary conseqence of biological information systems (e.g., genetic systems, chromosomal organization, cytoplasmic organization) obeying the second law of thermodynamics <ref> (Brooks and Wiley, 1988) </ref>. Large numbers of separate individuals exercise an extremely dispersed control over one another by competing for resources, reproducing themselves, adapting to particular habitats. But control is by no means entirely dispersed, residing only in each individual. <p> Among the mechanisms known to produce genetic variation are: the introduction of new DNA from outside the population by viral transmission or hybridization; the change of existing DNA via mutations; the introduction of novel combinations by recombination, chromosomal mutations, or jumping genes <ref> (Brooks & Wiley, 1988) </ref>. The individuals successful in a given environment reproduce. Both sexual and asexual reproduction increase the variety of the gene pool in a population. Biological evolution has directly influenced the development of genetic or evolutionary learning algorithms (Holland, 1975; Fogel, Owens & Walsh, 1966) in artificial intelligence.

Reference-contexts: Attentional processes play a crucial role in the perceptual and cognitive functions of the brain. The reticular complex of the thalamus is thought to control the focus of focus of attention or the attentional searchlight <ref> (Crick, 1984) </ref>. Almost all the input to the cortex (with the exception of olfactory input) passes through the thalamus. For each projection from a region of the thalamus to a region of the cortex, there is a corresponding projection in the opposite direction.

Reference-contexts: Many thousands of distinct chemical reactions carried out concurrently in a cell are closely coordinated <ref> (Dulbecco, 1987) </ref>. A variety of control mechanisms regulate the activities of key enzymes in response to the changing conditions in the cell. One very common form of regulation is a rapidly reversible feedback inhibition exerted on the first enzyme of the pathway by the final product of the pathway.

Reference-contexts: The prevailing view is that cell surface molecules operate by regulating the changes in the probability of interactions between cells without affecting the absolute limits of connectivity. One mechanism exerting macroscopic control over a developing ensemble of cells is the dynamic production of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) <ref> (Edelman, 1987) </ref>. These molecules link cells into collectives whose borders are defined by CAMs of different specificity. The binding properties of cells linked by CAMs are dynamically controlled by the cells themselves as a result of signals exchanged between collectives.

Reference-contexts: Oscillators using similar principles have been found wherever they have been looked for in a wide variety of nervous systems, from sea slugs to mammals (Changeux, 1984). Transitions between oscillating and non-oscillating states are quite common in physiological systems <ref> (Glass & Mackey, 1988) </ref>. Such systems have two stable states oscillating and non-oscillating and the transition between the two states can be effected by signals extrinsic to the system.

Reference-contexts: This has the effect of gradually masking out the strongest features in the input so that the weaker features get attended. This effect has been observed in models of the olfactory cortex that learn to detect weak hidden odor signals even when they are dominated by much stronger odors <ref> (Granger, Ambros-Ingerson, Staubli & Lynch, 1989) </ref>. It is likely that there are multiple attentional processes in the brain subserving various forms of attention. Many such processes can be incorporated into CN using reciprocal links between layers of units.

Reference-contexts: The individual parts of a computer its memories and processors, and the logic gates from which they are built are all precisely structured to execute their specific functions without any error <ref> (See Hamacher, Vranesic & Zaky, 1984, for details) </ref>. This structure, plus the information they receive (clock pulses, instructions), completely control and determine behavior. Programs (which from the present perspective are simply specifications of computers that the computers that execute them simulate) are similarly completely controlled.

Reference-contexts: The wide range of predominantly chemical communication taking place at the cellular level in biological systems outlined above suggest corresponding coordination and control processes that might be useful in CN. They can be instantiated in CN by the use of distributed code-book-like mechanisms (Uhr, 1990b) or by marker-passing networks <ref> (Hendler, 1989) </ref> that encode, transmit, and decode messages in which the markers or tokens play roles analogous to those of the proteins and neurotransmitters that carry chemically encoded messages in living systems.

Behave, Evolve-Learn, and Control Functions In today's CN, only the function that each primitive behave unit, B, computes is completely defined in terms of both the individual node involved and the global graph structure over the total set of nodes.

Reference-contexts: The possibility of dynamic switching processes has been suggested in the context of several different aspects of visual perceptual processes in the brain for example, attention and stereopsis <ref> (e.g., Julesz, 1984) </ref>. But since the complete separation between a conventional computer's stored-program memory, its serial processor, and its various input and output devices is not found in CN (or in brains), switching functions must be highly distributed.

Reference-contexts: A pyramid-like hierarchy of such shifter circuits could exert very precise control over the particular computations applied to particular segments of the sensory input. Functionally equivalent control structures are used in many pipelined image processing computer systems (e.g., the PIPE <ref> (Kent, Schneier & Lumia, 1985) </ref>) for programmer-exerted control over the particular processes/transforms applied to particular segments of the image. Reciprocal connections between layers of neurons in the brain are ubiquitous.

Such networks of clocks can potentially perform elaborate control functions in CN.

The theta rhythm in the hippocampus as well as olfactory cortex is synchronized with the rate at which the rats sample olfactory stimuli by sniffing. <p> This has the effect of gradually masking out the strongest features in the input so that the weaker features get attended.

Reference-contexts: Generation of specialized cells from less specialized ancestors is a central feature of development. Such differentiation is influenced by at least 3 types of control: instructions contained in the genes; instructions from the cytoplasm of the developing cell, and instructions from other developing cells in the local extracellular environment <ref> (Purves & Lichtman, 1985) </ref>. The emerging view of cell differentiation is that it is the result of a qualitative change in gene expression. <p> The prevailing view appears to be that the differentiating cells retain the entire set of genetic instructions during development, and perhaps throughout life. However, a gradual, controlled, restriction of gene expression causes cells to become more and more specialized <ref> (Purves & Lichtman, 1985) </ref>. <p> This suggests the existence of a means of providing information about position, and cellular mechanisms that interpret, and act upon the basis of, such information <ref> (Purves & Lichtman, 1985) </ref>. The accurate location of neurons and their processes is fundamental to the formation of correct patterns of neuronal connections. In vertebrates, the migration of neuronal precursors from their sites of origin to their final destinations is a crucial step in this process. <p> Growing axons travel substantial distances enroute to their targets, apparently guided by a number of directional and positional cues (e.g., mechanical guides, pathways of differential adhesiveness, electrical fields, tropic gradients emanating from targets) that seem to act in concert <ref> (Purves & Lichtman, 1985) </ref>. Given the range of control that is needed to ensure the proper arrangement, differentiation, and wiring of populations of neurons, the molecular mechanisms of cellular recognition are of great interest.

Reference-contexts: These systems are quite distinct from the classical sensory projections to the cortex via the thalamus. For example, cortical norepinephrine originates in the locus coeruleus, which contains only several hundred cells that send slow-conducting axonal connections to almost every region in the central nervous system <ref> (Shepherd, 1988) </ref>, including the amygdala and the hippocampus both of which have been implicated in memory and learning in higher mammals. Similar separate systems have been identified for several other neurotransmitters, e.g., dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and GABA (See Shepherd, 1988, for details). <p> Similar separate systems have been identified for several other neurotransmitters, e.g., dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and GABA <ref> (See Shepherd, 1988, for details) </ref>. These projections offer a number of different ways in which discrete subcortical regions can affect the activity of cortical neurons. <p> Based on a large body of experimental work, the concept has emerged that circadian systems are composed of multiple oscillators, each with properties to some extent specific and distinct from others <ref> (Shepherd, 1988) </ref>. Individual pacemaker neurons, that spontaneously fire in a regular, repeated rhythm, appear to serve as local pulsers, or clocks. In the sea slug (Aplysia), such pacemaker neurons are found at the base of the eye. <p> The EEG rhythm is believed to arise mainly in the thalamus, as a result of the intrinsic pacemaker property of cells and the properties of synaptic circuits within the thalamus. In the cortex, the thalamic input causes rhythmic synaptic depolarization of the apical dendrites of the cortical pyramidal cells <ref> (see Shepherd, 1988, for details) </ref>. Arousal (and sleep) are behaviors that affect the entire animal. Arousal seems to be mediated by the reticular activating system, stimulated by sensory collaterals, and activated through thalamic nuclei.

Reference-contexts: systems that perceive and think: * They are loosely brain-like, with their extremely large numbers of very simple primitive units, and the many links between them that build into the total structure. * They have the potential of being made far more brain-like, by making the primitive units more neuron-like <ref> (Shepherd, 1989) </ref>, and by introducing micro-circuits and successively larger assemblies that incorporate more brain-like structures and processes (Uhr, 1989; Honavar & Uhr, 1990a; 1990b). * They are general-purpose in the sense of Turing machines, Post productions, and other equivalent universal computers (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943; Pollack, 1987).

Reference-contexts: For example, neuronal transmission from the perforant pathway through the dentate gyrus is more effective during slow-wave sleep than when the animal is quiet and alert. This change in transmission is modulated by norepinephrine and serotonin innervation of the dentate gyrus <ref> (Squire, 1987) </ref>. The activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus is correlated with the level of vigilance of the animal. It has been suggested that locus coeruleus activity prepares the fore-brain for processing important stimuli, and as a consequence, that increased vigilance, or attention, leads to more effective learning (Squire, 1987). <p> gyrus <ref> (Squire, 1987) </ref>. The activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus is correlated with the level of vigilance of the animal. It has been suggested that locus coeruleus activity prepares the fore-brain for processing important stimuli, and as a consequence, that increased vigilance, or attention, leads to more effective learning (Squire, 1987). Hormones have significant modulatory effects on memory as well. An example is the action of epinephrine (released in the adrenal medulla), which ordinarily influences the degree of retention after a learning experience. <p> Endogenous opioid peptides (the endorphins and enkephalins) and their antagonists have been implicated in the modulation of memory and learning. The opiate antagonist naloxone improves selective attention thereby facilitating better learning <ref> (Squire, 1987) </ref>. In the context of CN, mechanisms analogous to those of neuromodulators and hor-mones that operate on a much slower time-scale than the timescales associated with the firing of individual neurons can be instantiated by additional control subnetworks that are embedded in the CN.

Reference-contexts: Such transient cell assemblies can link neural representations of higher level concepts with their lower level constituent sub-concepts in the dynamic fashion required by the psycho-physically inspired models of attention <ref> (Treisman & Gelade, 1980) </ref>. Transient cell assemblies also provide one possible solution to the variable binding problem in CN. A model of attention involving a saliency map suspected to be located in the parietal lobe or area IT has been proposed by Koch & Ullman (1985).

Reference-contexts: The following rather general definition <ref> (Uhr, 1990a) </ref> makes clear that many other than today's standard type of CN can be constructed; it also makes precise comparisons possible. A CN is a graph (of linked nodes) with a particular topology, where nodes compute several different types of function (behave, evolve-learn, and control).

Reference-contexts: The wide range of predominantly chemical communication taking place at the cellular level in biological systems outlined above suggest corresponding coordination and control processes that might be useful in CN. They can be instantiated in CN by the use of distributed code-book-like mechanisms <ref> (Uhr, 1990b) </ref> or by marker-passing networks (Hendler, 1989) that encode, transmit, and decode messages in which the markers or tokens play roles analogous to those of the proteins and neurotransmitters that carry chemically encoded messages in living systems.

Reference-contexts: Lyapunov (1963) characterized the evolution of living nature (and hence, one might suggest, that of intelligent behavior) as a process of proliferation of, and selection among, control systems of various types. Similar considerations motivated the early work in cybernetics <ref> (Wiener, 1961) </ref>. The lack of appropriate control structures and processes is a major reason possibly the most important reason why CN of large numbers of simple units have not yet succeeded at handling difficult tasks (e.g., complex object recognition and description, complex problem-solving, planning).
