Abstract: This report presents routing algorithms for many-to-many multicast connections with bandwidth requirements. The objective is to compute a connectivity structure among multicast members of low cost, taking into account their bandwidth requirements. We first study the complexity of routing multicast connections with bandwidth reservation. Based on derived impossibility results, we propose a cluster strategy to connect multicast members, called Bandwidth Constrained Steiner Tree (BCST) strategy. We show that BCST strategy is the best polynomial time algorithm for such routing problems, in the sense of worst case performance. We propose two BCST algorithms, and claim hard bounds on cost and bandwidth overload. We study the proposed algorithms' performance on randomly generated multicast routing problems, and compare them against two well known routing strategies for multicast connection: Shortest Path Tree (SPT), where a SPT is built per multicast source, taking into account bandwidth requirements; and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), where a single Steiner Tree is built to provide connectivity among multicast members, regardless of their bandwidth requirements. Our simulation experiments show that BCST algorithms strike a balance between blocking probability and tree cost, when compared against both SPT and MST algorithms. fl This work was partially supported by CNPq under Grant 201597/93-4(NV)

Reference-contexts: We now prove the following theorem: Theorem 2 BD-Dijkstra algorithm computes ffi c (s; d) shortest path as defined above. Although we can prove the algorithm from scratch, we will rather build our proof on top of the correctness of the original Dijkstra algorithm <ref> [Cormen90] </ref>. In the course of the proof, we differentiate between w and c edge costs. We need the following lemmas: 8 Lemma 1 BD-Dijkstra is a usual Dijkstra algorithm with respect to the edge cost function w. It, therefore, computes ffi w (s; d).

Reference-contexts: For many-to-many type of connections, however, to our knowledge there is no routing algorithm in the literature which includes bandwidth reservation. Multicast traffic is typically carried through one (Core Based Tree) or more (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol) multicast trees <ref> [Deering96] </ref>, for efficiency of network resources. We address the problem of constructing multicast trees, so as to provide not only connectivity among 3 members of a multicast connection, but also bandwidth necessary to carry the traffic injected by multicast members. The report is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: However, for truly multicast connections (mtp-mtp), we are indeed facing a NP-Complete problem, as will be shown shortly. Although the problem of constructing Steiner trees is hardly new (e.g. [Smith83]), its study has intensified in the last ten years due to its direct applicability to multimedia networks <ref> [Frank85, Makki95] </ref>. Moreover, multimedia connections are likely to add some constraints in feasible trees, such as bandwidth and delay. Research work on the construction of Steiner Trees with such constraints is less abundant in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Although the minimum cost matching problem is in P T IM E, we have chosen an approximation algorithm by Goemans at al. <ref> [Goemans93] </ref>, with worst case of twice the minimum cost matching, so that we can solve relatively large multicast tree problems. Their algorithm runs in O (jV j 2 log jV j) time, which is the same as BD-Dijkstra for all bandwidth constrained shortest path, used in step (2.1).

Reference-contexts: The work is limited, however, in a sense that it assumes that every multicast member has the same bandwidth needs, and does not provide performance guarantees of any kind. <ref> [Ravi95] </ref> establishes hard results, and proposes algorithms for the construction of constrained Steiner Tree problems, where the constraints are the diameter of the tree and the maximum degree of a vertex. It also provides worst case guarantees for algorithms performance. <p> In a similar approach to <ref> [Ravi95] </ref>, we use an approximation preserving reduction from the MIN SET COVER problem to 2 problem, to prove the following theorem: Theorem 5 Unless N P DT IM E (n log log n ), given an instance of the (Bandwidth, Total Cost, Steiner tree) problem with k =j S [ D <p> The proof now follows from the previous theorem. Based on Theorem 5, we advocate the use of a cluster type of polynomial time algorithm to solve problem 2, in a similar approach of <ref> [Ravi95] </ref>, since such strategy is likely to provide a ln factor bound on the mtree cost. 4 A cluster algorithm for low cost mtrees The basic idea is to design an algorithm that works in phases.

Reference-contexts: The problem of routing unicast (one-to-one) unidirectional connections with bandwidth reservation was shown to be solved by a Dijkstra type algorithm <ref> [Wang95] </ref> for link state routing. For many-to-many type of connections, however, to our knowledge there is no routing algorithm in the literature which includes bandwidth reservation. <p> Conclusions are drawn in the last section. 2 Related Work As mentioned earlier, the most important network resource to be allocated by a QOS network is bandwidth. Unicast (pt-pt) routing has been shown to be of polynomial complexity <ref> [Wang95] </ref>, and thus scalable with the size of the network. The idea is to disregard any link which does not have enough available bandwidth to carry the bandwidth required by the single source in the computation of a minimum cost path.
