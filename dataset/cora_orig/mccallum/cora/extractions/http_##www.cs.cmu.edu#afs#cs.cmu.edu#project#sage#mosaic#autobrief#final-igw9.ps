Title: A PRINCIPLED REPRESENTATION OF ATTRIBUTIVE DESCRIPTIONS FOR GENERATING INTEGRATED TEXT AND INFORMATION GRAPHICS PRESENTATIONS  
Author: Nancy Green*, Giuseppe Carenini**, and Johanna Moore** 
Address: Pittsburgh  
Affiliation: *Carnegie Mellon University, **University of  
Abstract: This paper describes a media-independent, compositional, plan-based approach to representing attributive descriptions for use in integrated text and graphics generation. An attributive description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience to identify a particular referent. This approach has been implemented as part of an architecture for generating integrated text and information graphics. Uses of referential and attributive descriptions are represented as two distinct types of communicative acts in a media-independent plan. It is particularly important to distinguish the two types of acts, since they have different consequences for dialogue and text generation, and for graphic design.

Reference-contexts: Previous integrated text and graphic generation systems, e.g., [Fasciano and Lapalme1996, Feiner and McKeown1991, Maybury1991, Wahlster et al.1993] have not attempted to perform task-based design of graphics as in our approach. Previous work on natural language reference in multimedia generation <ref> [Andre and Rist1994, McKeown et al.1992] </ref> has focused on coordination of pictorial and textual references to concrete objects and to actions to be performed on the objects, and on generating references to the presentation itself.

Reference-contexts: To achieve the effect of this action, the text and graphics generators are free to select any device that will enable the user to identify the object (subject to pragmatically appropriate identification constraints <ref> [Appelt and Kronfeld1987] </ref>). In other words, since the function of the description is purely referential, its content does not contribute directly to the presentation's goals and thus is not represented in the plan. <p> The implications of the referential-attributive distinction for centering theory are discussed in [Grosz et al.1983]. <ref> [Appelt and Kronfeld1987] </ref> provides a formal theory that derives the effects of referring actions.

Reference-contexts: An attributive description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience to identify a particular referent <ref> [Donnellan1977, Kronfeld1986] </ref>. While the generation of referential descriptions has received considerable attention in text and multimedia generation, the generation of attributive descriptions has received relatively little attention in computational linguistics. However, such descriptions are pervasive in the type of presentations which is the focus of our research. <p> Next, we discuss its importance in task-based graphic design. After providing an overview of our architecture, we describe how attributive descriptions are planned. We conclude with a survey of related work. 2 Referential-Attributive Distinction in Language <ref> [Donnellan1977] </ref> describes two different possible uses of definite descriptions: 1 An attributive description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience to identify a particular referent.

Reference-contexts: level.) These media-independent goals are achieved by media-independent il-locutionary actions [Searle1970], e.g., Assert, and Recommend, which themselves are decomposed into media-independent actions that correspond to attributive and referential uses of descriptions.

The step of the operator shown in Figure 2 underlying (3)ii is an Assert action. <p> Without such a specification in the plan, a graphic might be designed showing only that Realtors Inc. serves Berlin, or worse, that Realtors Inc. serves the city with the worst pollution in Somerset County.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, if the system provided only table (f ) of Figure 1, task (D) but not task (B) would be facilitated, and thus the overall presentation might not be as effective. 4 Overview of Generation Architecture As reported in a previous paper <ref> [Kerpedjiev et al.1997] </ref>, we are investigating the integration of two complementary approaches to automatic generation of presentations: hierarchical planning to achieve communicative goals and task-based graphic design. Many researchers in natural language processing, e.g., [Moore1995], have modeled presentation design as a process of hierarchical planning to achieve communicative goals.

Reference-contexts: sequence of logical tasks of searching for Arlington in a graphic, finding its population attribute, and then looking up the value; furthermore, these tasks could be performed using a graphic such as (a) in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Propositions such as ?p2 and ?p1 are represented in a RQFOL (first-order logic with restricted quantification). RQFOL has been used for representing the meaning of natural language queries involving complex referring expressions <ref> [Webber1983, Woods1983] </ref>. In addition to providing a powerful, compositional representation scheme for the complex descriptions occurring in our domain, 3 The tasks are called logical tasks since they do not presuppose a particular graphic design. <p> For example, the Proposition plan constraint of the operator in Figure 2, makes use of the RQFOL representation of ?p1 to extract information with which to instantiate the plan variables ?main-pred1 and ?refs1 with the main predication of ?p1 and a list describing the discourse entities <ref> [Webber1983] </ref> evoked or accessed by use of ?main-pred1, respectively. (The significance to presentation generation of the distinction between the main predication and information about discourse referents is discussed in [Green et al.1998].)

Reference-contexts: Propositions such as ?p2 and ?p1 are represented in a RQFOL (first-order logic with restricted quantification). RQFOL has been used for representing the meaning of natural language queries involving complex referring expressions <ref> [Webber1983, Woods1983] </ref>. In addition to providing a powerful, compositional representation scheme for the complex descriptions occurring in our domain, 3 The tasks are called logical tasks since they do not presuppose a particular graphic design.

Reference-contexts: Researchers in graphics have emphasized the need to design presentations that support the perceptual and logical tasks a user must perform [Beshers and Feiner1993, Casner1991, Roth and Mattis1990]. In our hybrid approach, a hierarchical planner <ref> [Young1994] </ref> is used to refine genre-specific but media-independent presentation goals into genre-independent and media-independent subgoals. (For simplicity, in the rest of this paper we shall refer to the genre-independent and media-independent level of the plan just as the media-independent level.) These media-independent goals are achieved by media-independent il-locutionary actions [Searle1970], e.g., <p> Our system uses media-independent presentation operators to perform content selection and high-level organization of the presentation. For example, Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the presentation operator that would be used to generate (3) above, in the formalism used by the presentation planner <ref> [Young1994] </ref>.
