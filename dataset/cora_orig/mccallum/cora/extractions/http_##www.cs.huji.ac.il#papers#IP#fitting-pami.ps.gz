Title: Fitting a Second Degree Curve if Both Coordinates Are Subject to Error  
Author: M. Werman and Z. Geyzel 
Abstract: This paper presents a statistically sound, simple and fast method to estimate the parameters of a second degree curve from a set of noisy points that originated from the curve.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Fitting a straight line or another figure that is consistent with and approximates a set of data points is a common problem encountered in computer vision, pattern recognition or statistics. The literature is full of different methods that find the "best" describing figure for a set of points, see <ref> [1] </ref> for a summary.

Reference-contexts: The literature is full of different methods that find the "best" describing figure for a set of points, see [1] for a summary. The method of least squares for computing the parameters is used very often even though for over 100 years <ref> [3] </ref> it has been known that in the case of noise in both the x and y axes, the least squares estimate is biased even for the case of straight line fitting.

Reference-contexts: We will first present the solution for the straight line case as it has less parameters and is a little easier to describe. In the straight line case the method is somewhat similar to the method proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. We will then present the general solution. The problem What we are modeling is the following: There is a plane curve fl that is a conic section; i.e. the curve is a set of points (x; y) s.t.
