Abstract: 3 The delays at all sink nodes were measured using the two-pole circuit simulator proposed by Zhou et al. [17] and discussed in [3]. This simulator is a computationally efficient code which has produced very accurate results (within a few percent) when tested against SPICE. We consider both the average delay (taken over all sinks) and the worst-case delay (i.e., the latest arrival time of the signal to any sink); all results are normalized to the We make the following observations. 1. While BRBC tends to yield lower tree cost for any fixed ff, if we consider the family of trees over each instance, we see that the AHHK solution will almost always have lower cost for any given tree dius. 4. For each instance of each net size, we recorded the c and * values that afforded lowest signal delay over the entire family of 21 trees generated by each algorithm. The average "best" parameterization is reported in Table 3, and is useful in guiding the application of AHHK when it is too Analysis of distributed RC delay shows that performance-driven routing requires tree constructions that can trade off cost and radius according to interconnect technology and net size. Previous approaches [2, 4, 10] essentially rely on a depth first traversal of the MST and insert shortest paths as needed to maintain a prescribed radius bound. In contrast, our new AHHK approach directly combines the recurrences for Prim's MST algorithm and Dijk-stra's SPT algorithm. The result is an elegant tradeoff between radius and cost which empirically yields lower-cost trees than the BRBC algorithm [4] for any given tree radius. Simulation results show that the AHHK algorithm constructs routing trees with significantly less maximum and average delay than the BRBC method [4], in both IC and MCM intercon nect technologies. We are pursuing integration of 3 Specifics of the technology files (IC,MCM): driver resistance = (100,25) ; wire resistance = (0.03,0.008) =m; wire inductance = (492,380) fH=m; sink loading capacitance = (15.3,1000) f F ; wire capacitance = (0.352,0.06) fF=m; layout area = (10 2 ; 100 2 ) mm 2 . Although AHHK can yield tree cost an unbounded factor greater than the MST cost in general graphs, we conjecture that AHHK trees have bounded cost for instances that are embedded in the Manhattan plane, i.e., there exists a constant fi such that AHHK will always produce a (1=c; fi)-tree for any given value of c. We are also considering alternate Prim-Dijkstra tradeoffs, as described in [1]. [17] D. Zhou, S. Su, F. Tsui, D. S. Gao and J.
