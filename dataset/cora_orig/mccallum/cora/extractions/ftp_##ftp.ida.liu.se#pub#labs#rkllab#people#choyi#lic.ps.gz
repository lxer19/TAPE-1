Allen Allen in <ref> [All84, All91, AK83] </ref> presented a first order temporal logic with a linear time model, motivated mainly to deal with concurrent actions and action duration. <p> An example would be explanatory here. Suppose that a door is equipped with, besides a handle, a spring latch, and in order to open the door you should hold the latch open with one hand, while you pull open the door with the other hand <ref> [All91] </ref>. It can be expressed in Allen's formalism as in Figure 2.1, where LC, DO, HL, etc. are self-referential time intervals of the features LatchClosed and DoorOpen, and of the action HoldLatch, respectively. One can see how these intervals are identified in relation to each other. <p> Similiarly, if nothing prevents P from being true before t, an assumption might be made that P was true some time before t." <ref> [All91, p. 17] </ref> 13 2 Previous Approaches 5 7 10 CLOSED OPEN time ? side-effect at the same time. <p> First, let us consider in an informal manner how concurrent interactions are to be understood and described in the trajectory semantics. 4.2.1 Concurrent Interactions In a broad sense, concurrent actions may be interacting or noninteracting , and, if they interact, they may interact interferingly or noninterferingly. Allen <ref> [All91] </ref> and Pelavin [Pel91] describe the noninteracting actions such 36 4:2 Concurrency in the Trajectory Semantics that their joint effects are simply the sum of their individual effects, and point out that noninterfering actions may interact to cause additional effects besides their own. 1 Among the concurrent interactions, one needs to

The result of executing two actions simultaneously in a state is defined as the intersection of the resulting states of the individual actions, where empty intersection means the actions cannot occur simultaneously in the state.

Reference-contexts: Georgeff in her logic. Nevertheless, the atomic actions are still instantaneous, and only simultaneous concurrency is possible for them. Lansky introduces a lot of temporal "modal" operators such as "henceforth", "eventually", "next", "weak until", "before", "until now", and "back to", which makes her formalism highly abstrct. As Haack <ref> [Haa78] </ref> points out, while such concepts enrich expressiveness, it's not clear whether they are amenable to formal treatment.

Kowalski and M. Sergot As an alternative approach to the situation calculus for representing and reasoning about actions and time, Kowalski & Sergot <ref> [KS86] </ref> developed another formalism based on first order logic, the event calculus. The event calculus is formulated in logic programming style, and so sentences are expressed in Horn clauses and negation as failure is added as a nonmonotonic inference rule. <p> In the event calculus, time points can also be available by associating each action with the metric time value at which it occurs. Second, one doesn't reason by global states but by local actions <ref> [KS86] </ref>. Since the situation calculus views actions as functions on states, performing an action necessarily causes a global consequence there. On the other hand, in the event calculus actions bring about local effects only, i.e. they just initiate or terminate some time periods. <p> The self-referential time intervals, though, can be given meaning little by 4 Kowalski & Sergot were aware that actions take time, but according to them <ref> [KS86, p. 74] </ref>, "it suffices to adopt the convention that events occur "after" the period they end, "before" those they start and are not wholly contained within them." However this does not solve our problem! 5 Henceforth time periods are used interchangeably with time intervals , and time points with time

Reference-contexts: In order to manage inertia Allen relies on the persistency assumption <ref> [McD82] </ref>. However, his use of the persistency assumption is somewhat strange in that it is applied backward as well as forward in time! 7 His motivation is that by doing so one can, given incomplete information, derive some conclusions not only on the future but also on the past.

It means, every action occurrence requires not merely to infer the features that become true because of the action but also to transfer all the features which remain unchanged.

Reference-contexts: However, using negation as failure which their formalism is augumented with can be a useful practical method to cope with inertia; event calculus formulas can easily be implemented in e.g. PROLOG. Actually, in <ref> [Sad87] </ref> negation as failure is found to join the local treatment of actions in maintaining inertia; roughly, if a property caused by some action held at a time point t1, recall time points are allowed, and it can not be shown that the property has been terminated by another action between <p> In addition, as discussed in section 1 lack of expressibility of actions' duration leads to more limitations; actions which have effects only during their occurrence, and trajectories of actions can not be dealt with sufficiently. 4 Sadri <ref> [Sad87] </ref> shows how Allen's logic discussed in section 2.2 can be modified to incorporate event calculus features and seems to conclude that each of the two approaches can be modified in order to obtain features offered by the other.

Reference-contexts: Rather, any of the two may be possible and motivated depending on the problem domain given, and also the choice may be viewed as a matter of trade-off . As Sandewall <ref> [San94] </ref> points out, the fact that metric time plays a central role in our civilization, and in domains like physics one uses metric time. <p> n (n 1)=2 temporal relations between them! On the other hand, in some situations it may be unnecessary, too costly, or impossible to stipulate time explicitly by metric values, e.g. an action sometimes takes 3 seconds, but sometimes 3.5 or 4.3 seconds, or time intervals for which discrete-valued features hold <ref> [San94] </ref>. In these cases actions or features themselves would be effective or only possible time units. <p> Then, formally, the ego and the world interact in terms of finite developments which is defined as follows. Definition 3.1 <ref> [San94] </ref> A finite development is a tuple hB; M; R; A; Ci where * B T is a finite subset of T whose members will be called breakpoints. <p> However, the game may continue infinitely. In this case, a resulting development is acquired for each infinite branch by taking the limit of the finite developments. For a formal and more detailed definition on the "game", please refer to <ref> [San94] </ref>. 3.2 Taxonomy As mentioned previously in Introduction, one of the characteristics of Sande-wall's systematic approach is the use of a taxonomy of reasoning prob lems. <p> In particular, [t ] ) [t; t]ff [t ](fl ) ff): 3 The expansion of := is trivial in DFL-1, but it is put to non-trivial use in DFL-2 <ref> [San94] </ref>. <p> this override operation as follows; r i = r r 0 A trajectory semantics world W can then be characterized by a pair hInfl; Trajsi where the pair is a world description and W is the corresponding world of the world description. 4.2 Concurrency in the Tra jectory Semantics In <ref> [San94] </ref> the trajectory semantics was defined with the restriction that only sequential actions are allowed, i.e. at most one action is considered at a time. However, in dealing with concurrent actions new problems arise which were not there for sequential actions. <p> Following Sandewall <ref> [San94] </ref>, we present in this chapter a definition of the K-IAC family of reasoning problems where concurrent actions are allowed. 5.1 The K-IAD and the K-IACD Families Let hInfl; Trajsi be a world description, and let W be its corresponding world. <p> Then for the world W to be appropriate for the K epistemological assumption, it is required that Trajs (E; r) 6= ? for every E and r <ref> [San94] </ref>. That is, we assume, for any action and state given, that there is a definition for how to perform the action from that state. <p> Let args (E) be the set of objects which occur as arguments in E. Then a world described by the pair hInfl; Trajsi is said to have strict locality <ref> [San94] </ref> iff for all E, r, and r 0 r=args (E) = r 0 =args (E) ) Infl (E; r) = Infl (E; r 0 ) F =args (E) ^ Trajs (E; r) = Trajs (E; r 0 ): That is, the set of possible outcomes of an action E is <p> The case where the action's duration is not considered, which Sandewall refers to as encapsulated actions, is much simpler. For a full explanation of the process of constructing FTNF formulae, please refer to <ref> [San94] </ref>. 6.2 An Example As an example, 2 consider a situation shown in Figure 6.1 where a cart is standing in front of the curb, and we want to move it over the curb. <p> Scenario descriptions are formally defined as follows. Definition 6.1 <ref> [San94] </ref> A scenario description, denoted as , is a tuple hZ; 1 ; ::: k i where Z is an epistemological characteristics, and the following elements are sets of formulae or other formal objects. <p> The number and type of the following elements is specific for each choice of Z. 2 Definition 6.2 <ref> [San94] </ref> A scenario description in K is a tuple hK; O; Diw; scd; obsi where O is an object domain, Diw, a description of the world, is a tuple h; fl 1 ; :::fl n i where is an ontological characteristics and the subsequent fl i are either a set of <p> In a context where the use of K is self-evident, the scenario will be written more compactly as hO; A; scd; obsi: In preparation for the forthcoming discussion, the following definitions <ref> [San94] </ref> are made. Let M be a valuation, an expression, a formula or a set of formulae, then M [] shall be the formula or set of formulae modified by replacing each constant symbol in by its value according to M . <p> In this chapter we apply PCM to K IAC scenarios for assessing its applicabili-ties. We begin with presenting the criterion PCM.

Reference-contexts: Also, it's interesting to observe that actions' pre-conditions, prevail-conditions and post-conditions are stated by comparing their intervals to those of actions. 6 6 Prevail-conditions and post-conditions are conditions that should hold during, respectively, after execution of actions <ref> [SR86] </ref>. Usually, post-conditions are called effects. 11 2 Previous Approaches The axioms in Figure 2.1 show how the problems arising from lack of expressibility regarding action's duration can be solved. <p> The trajectory preserving condition is a generalization of the prevail condition of Sandewall & Ronnquist <ref> [SR86] </ref> in that both two refer to conditions that should hold during an action performance.
