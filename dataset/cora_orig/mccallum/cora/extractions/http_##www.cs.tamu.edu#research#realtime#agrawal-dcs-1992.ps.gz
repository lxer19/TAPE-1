Abstract: We study the problem of guaranteeing synchronous message deadlines in token ring networks where the timed token medium access control protocol is employed. Synchronous capacity, defined as the maximum time for which a node can transmit its synchronous messages every time it receives the token, is a key parameter in the control of synchronous message transmission. To ensure the transmission of synchronous messages before their deadlines, synchronous capacities must be properly allocated to individual nodes. We address the issue of appropriate allocation of the synchronous capacities. Several synchronous capacity allocation schemes are analyzed in terms of their ability to satisfy deadline constraints of synchronous messages. We show that an inappropriate allocation of the synchronous capacities could cause message deadlines to be missed, even if the synchronous traffic is extremely low. We propose a scheme, called the normalized proportional allocation scheme, which can guarantee the synchronous message deadlines for synchronous traffic of up to 33% of available utilization. To date, no other synchronous capacity allocation scheme has been reported to achieve such substantial performance. Another major contribution of this paper is an extension to the previous work on the bounded token rotation time. We prove that the time elapsed between any v consecutive visits to a particular node is bounded by v T T RT where T T RT is the target token rotation time. The previous result by Johnson and Sevcik [26, 48] is a special case where v = 2. Our newer bound is used in the analysis of various synchronous allocation schemes. It can also be applied in other similar studies.

The main objective of this study is to analyze and evaluate the synchronous capacity allocation schemes used with the timed token protocol in a hard real-time communication system. <p> Hence, this allocation scheme should be recommended for use in hard real-time communication networks that use the timed token MAC protocol. Another major contribution of this paper is an extension to the previous work on the bounded token rotation time given by Johnson and Sevcik in <ref> [26, 48] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As long as the utilization of the task set is no more than 69%, task deadlines are guaranteed to be satisfied. The algorithm was also proven to be optimal among all the fixed priority scheduling algorithms. The rate monotonic scheduling algorithm has been subsequently extended by many researchers <ref> [9, 49] </ref> and is used in many hard real-time applications [10]. Intuitively, one would believe that a communication protocol which implements the rate monotonic transmission policy is the most desirable for a real-time communication environment.

Reference-contexts: The timed token protocol has been incorporated into many network standards, including the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) [1, 2], IEEE 802.4 [19], the High-Speed Data Bus and the High-Speed Ring Bus (HSDB/HSRB) <ref> [8, 45, 46, 59] </ref>, and the Survivable Adaptable Fiber Optic Embedded Network (SAFENET) [14, 28, 35, 40]. Many embedded real-time applications use them as backbone networks. For example, the FDDI has been selected as a backbone network for NASA's Space Station Freedom [4, 7, 62].

Reference-contexts: The timed token protocol possesses this property. In [26, 48], Johnson 1 Some other synonymous terms that researchers use are: Bandwidth allocation <ref> [60] </ref>, Synchronous allocation [23], Synchronous bandwidth assignments [26], and High Priority token holding time [41]. 1 and Sevcik formally proved that when the network operates normally (i.e, there is no failure), the token rotation time between two consecutive visits to a node is bounded by twice the expected token rotation time <p> Further simulation studies have been carried out by Sankar and Yang [47] to study the influence of the Target Token Rotation Time on the performance of various network configurations. 3 Ulm <ref> [60] </ref> discussed the performance characteristics of the timed token protocol with respect to parameters such as the channel capacity, the network cable length, and the number of stations. <p> That is, t = fi+ where represents the protocol dependent overheads. 4 We define the ratio of t to T T RT to be ff. The usable ring utilization available for synchronous messages would therefore be (1 ff) <ref> [60] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Other analysis with respect to the throughput of asynchronous traffic has been done by Pang and Tobagi [41], Jayasumana and Werahera [24], Valenzo, Montuschi, and Ciminiera <ref> [61] </ref>, etc. Note that none of the above studies on the timed token protocol have specifically addressed the use and performance of the protocol in hard real-time environments. On the other hand, many studies of CSMA/CD and token ring protocols for distributed hard real-time applications have been conducted.

Reference-contexts: Many embedded real-time applications use them as backbone networks. For example, the FDDI has been selected as a backbone network for NASA's Space Station Freedom <ref> [4, 7, 62] </ref>. With the timed token protocol, messages are grouped into two separate classes: the synchronous class and the asynchronous class. Synchronous messages arrive in the system at regular intervals and may be associated with deadline constraints.

Reference-contexts: A timing failure could lead to a catastrophe. Further, these systems are often distributed. This is not only because the applications themselves are often physically distributed, but also due to the potential that distributed systems have for providing good reliability, good resource sharing, and good extensibility <ref> [53, 54, 64] </ref>. The key to success in using a distributed system for these applications is the timely execution of computation tasks that usually reside on different nodes and communicate with one another to accomplish a common goal.
