Reference-contexts: For a proof of (4.8), see <ref> [1] </ref> or [14]. Similarly, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, needed for the analysis of the multiplicative procedure (see [10] or [14], for example), is a direct consequence of the corresponding property for the full spaces S k .

Reference-contexts: Recall that this decomposition played a crucial role in <ref> [4] </ref>. It turns out that the decomposition (6.1) of S 0 j into S 0 0 and the subspaces V k = fQ 0 k1 u) j u 2 S 0 g (6.2) is stable, if R 2 n 0 is "rich enough".

Reference-contexts: Then the general theory of additive and multiplicative subspace correction methods can directly be applied. For a survey of this machinery, see the review articles of Xu [10] and of Yserentant [14], for example. Our construction has originally been motivated by the numerical solution of obstacle problems; see [6], <ref> [5] </ref>, [7]. In this application, the domain, on which linear elliptic problems have to be solved, is the subdomain where the current approximate solution does not touch the obstacle.

This considerably generalizes related results in <ref> [6] </ref>. Note that absolutely no regularity assumption concerning the boundary of the domain 0 entered. Even unphysical boundary conditions at a single point, which have no continuous counterpart, are allowed.

Reference-contexts: This was allowed in the last section. Nevertheless the condition is extremely weak. It covers domains which some people would call "fractal". Oswald <ref> [9] </ref> discusses a related condition for the solution of our problem. <p> We remark that the optimality of the decomposition (6.1) can be shown in a similar way; see <ref> [9] </ref>. Trying to keep the conditions on the boundary of 0 as weak (and simple) as possible, we did not attempt to prove such a result here.

The fact, that we are dealing with two space dimensions, enters the proof of this lemma. For three space dimensions, the estimate (5.4) is wrong. With Lemma 5.1, we can estimate the norm of the modified interpolation operators (5.1). <p> The scaling factor 4 k depends only on the number k of refinement levels, because the L 2 -like norm induced by the inner product (4.6) is scaled by the areas of the triangles in the initial triangulation. As an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.2 and of (5.8) (compare <ref> [11] </ref>, [12]), we can state Theorem 5.3 There exists a constant C depending only on the shape regularity of the triangles in T 0 (and not on the domain 0 !) such that jI 0 1 + k=1 k u I 0 0 Cj 2 juj 2 holds for all functions
