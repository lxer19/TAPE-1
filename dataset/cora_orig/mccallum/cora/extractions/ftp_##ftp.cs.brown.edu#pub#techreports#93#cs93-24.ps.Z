Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 Temporal reachability regarding double events, totally unordered, in a state space of polynomial size is NP-Complete. Proof. Given a directed graph with a set of forbidden pairs of arcs, the forbidden pairs (of arcs) problem <ref> [ Garey and Johnson, 1979 ] </ref> determines whether there is a path between two nodes without using both arcs in any forbidden pair of arcs. It is NP-Complete even 11 if all the forbidden pairs are disjoint. <p> Proof. The forbidden pairs of arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs is NP-Complete <ref> [ Garey and Johnson, 1979 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Our techniques provide a possible way to reduce temporal reasoning to graph reachability. Our results do not depend on any severe restrictions on the causal rules. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss the possibility of applying the concept of planning by hierarchical abstraction spaces <ref> [ Knoblock, 1991 ] </ref> to temporal reasoning, and point out that we cannot characterize abstraction hierarchies for temporal reasoning in the same way in planning, since we need to consider the ordering constraints on events and the limited number of available events. 2 Representations and Perspectives 2.1 Temporal Projection and Temporal <p> The algorithms for minimizing finite automata can be used to reduce the size of the state space. 5 Temporal Reasoning by Abstraction Knoblock <ref> [ Knoblock, 1991 ] </ref> discusses planning using abstraction hierarchies to reduce the size of the search space. Given an abstraction hierarchy for planning, variables are partitioned into levels. An abstract plan is searched at the highest level, and then refined level by level to incrementally achieve the goal conditions. <p> We do not need to backtrack to a higher level to explore other possibilities. Our framework of temporal reasoning by abstraction is analogous to Knoblock's abstraction hierarchies for planning. However, Knoblock's results <ref> [ Knoblock, 1991 ] </ref> , characterizing abstraction hierarchies for planning, cannot be directly applied to temporal reasoning, since the ordering constraints on events and the limitation on the number of available events are not considered in abstraction hierarchies for planning.

Reference-contexts: In the corresponding planning problem, the planner is free to select an arbitrary set of event instances from a fixed set of event types with no restrictions on the ordering of event instances. In special cases, temporal reasoning is harder than the corresponding planning problem <ref> [ Nebel and Backstrom, 1991 ] </ref> . This happens because in these special cases, the type, the number, and the occurring order of events can be controlled by the planner. In most cases, as long as the introduced events are not under control, however, both problems become computationally equivalent. <p> model the actions of the cars, 9 * the ordering constraints in O determine the set of possible event sequences Q E O . 3 Complexity Trade-offs Previous research on the complexity of temporal projection has primarily focused on the structure of causal rules [ Dean and Boddy, 1988 ] <ref> [ Nebel and Backstrom, 1991 ] </ref> . Causal rules determine how event instances trigger state transitions. In this paper, we find that the constraints on event ordering and the size of the involved state space also play important roles. <p> Proof. The forbidden pairs of arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs is NP-Complete [ Garey and Johnson, 1979 ] . By adapting the NP-Completeness proof for simple event systems in <ref> [ Nebel and Backstrom, 1991 ] </ref> , an instance of the forbidden pairs of arcs problem on a directed acyclic graph can be reduced to an instance of the temporal reachability problem where there is only a final state.
