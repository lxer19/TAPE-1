Reference-contexts: The remainder of the problem is being 3 addressed in a general way by the security community with the development of access controls <ref> [Cas95] </ref>. The second barrier, loss of control, requires sophisticated work flow control systems [Mcc93] and engineering change control systems [Har94] for the virtual enterprise as well as experience and the development of working relationships between companies.

Reference-contexts: To enable the creation of virtual enterprises, it is necessary to overcome these barriers. The first barrier, security, is being addressed in part by the communications industry that is developing secure and trusted communication protocols for the Internet based on public key encryption schemes <ref> [Gan94] </ref>. The remainder of the problem is being 3 addressed in a general way by the security community with the development of access controls [Cas95].

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the problem is being 3 addressed in a general way by the security community with the development of access controls [Cas95]. The second barrier, loss of control, requires sophisticated work flow control systems [Mcc93] and engineering change control systems <ref> [Har94] </ref> for the virtual enterprise as well as experience and the development of working relationships between companies. Hence, both cultural change as well as new technology is needed to overcome this barrier. In this paper, we contribute to the technological part of the solution.

Reference-contexts: In the area of product modeling, the new international STEP standards for exchange of product model data are an important technology for building the information infrastructure of a virtual manufacturing enterprise <ref> [ISO94a] </ref>. Many of the major CAD system vendors provide translators to and from this standard, and new parts of the standard for new application areas are under development. <p> For the purposes of our 6 information infrastructure, however, this simple view of the WWW and its functionality is sufficient. 2.2 Product Modeling - The STEP Standard The STEP standard is an international standard for the representation and exchange of product data <ref> [ISO94a] </ref>. A standard that seeks to communicate complete, unambiguous, accurate definitions of products is large and complex. However, the basic organization of STEP is relatively simple.

Reference-contexts: The Internet is the dominant networking standard today. The World Wide Web with tools such as Mosaic provides much of the basic communications capabilities needed for a virtual enterprise <ref> [Obr93] </ref>. In the future, ISDN and ATM networks may provide attractive alternatives to the Internet, but the Internet is in place today and allows communications around the world.

Reference-contexts: Many of the major CAD system vendors provide translators to and from this standard, and new parts of the standard for new application areas are under development. In the area of interoperability, one promising technology is the Common 5 Object Request Broker (CORBA) of the Object Management Group (OMG) <ref> [OMG93] </ref>. This technology provides what amounts to remote procedure calls through a network between application systems using well-defined, high-level descriptions of the interfaces supported by each system. Together, these technologies provide the basis for the information infrastructure proposed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: However, the basic organization of STEP is relatively simple. The standard can be broken into three parts: an infrastructure, a library of engineering product model definitions known as Parts 41 through 199, and a set of application protocols. The infrastructure can be further broken into the EXPRESS language <ref> [ISO94b, Sch94] </ref>, implementation methods, and testing methods. Everything in the STEP libraries and Application Protocols is described using the information modeling language EXPRESS.
