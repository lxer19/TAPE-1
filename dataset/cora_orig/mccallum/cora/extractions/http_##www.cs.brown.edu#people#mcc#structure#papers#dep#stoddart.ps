Title: Registration of multiple point sets

Abstract: Registering 3D point sets subject to rigid body motion is a common problem in computer vision. The optimal transformation is usually specified to be the minimum of a weighted least squares cost. The case of 2 point sets has been solved by several authors using analytic methods such as SVD. In this paper we present a numerical method for solving the problem when there are more than 2 point sets. Although of general applicability the new method is particularly aimed at the multiview surface registration problem. To date almost all authors have registered only two point sets at a time. This approach discards information and we show in quantitative terms the errors caused.

Reference-contexts: Free-form surfaces taken from multiple viewpoints must be registered prior to fusion. Typically more than 10 views are needed to reconstruct an entire object and each view will overlap with several neighbours [5, 6]. Most range image registration algorithms are variations of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Most published algorithms study the case of registering 2 surfaces at a time. There are many situations where there are more than two point sets to be combined. Turk and Levoy [6] address a surface fusion problem where multiple surfaces may be combined. <p> The improvement may be very slight, but range data is often used in applications where accuracy is important. The problem of multiple view registration has also been addressed by Gagnon el al [2]. Most surface registration algorithms <ref> [1, 7, 6] </ref> generalize immediately to multiple surfaces provided that a multiple point set registration algorithm is available. It is for applications such as this that we present our method. 3. Problem Specification We assume that there are M distinct rigid bodies.

Reference-contexts: The solution can be improved by considering also the overlap between pairs of secondary views.

For a discussion of the various methods see Kanatani <ref> [3] </ref> and references therein. In a recent paper [4] the various methods were compared. It was concluded that the various analytical methods give answers in good agreement with each other for non-degenerate data sets. Point set registration is needed in many applications in range imaging.

In the absence of a suitable technique for mul tiple point set fusion they register all views to a single mas-ter view.
