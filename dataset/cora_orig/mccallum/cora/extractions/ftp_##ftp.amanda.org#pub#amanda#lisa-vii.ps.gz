Abstract: We present Amanda, a freely redistributable network backup manager written at the University of Maryland. Amanda is designed to make backing up large networks of data-full workstations to gigabyte tape drives automatic and efficient. Amanda runs on top of standard Unix backup tools such as dump and gnu tar. It takes care of balancing the backup schedule and handling any problems that arise. Amanda runs backups in parallel to insure a reasonable run time for the nightly backups, even in the presence of slow computers on the network. Tape labeling insures that the wrong tape is not overwritten. A report detailing any problems is mailed to the system administrator in the morning. In our department, we use Amanda to back up about 35 gigabytes of data in 336 filesystems on more than 130 workstations, using a single 5 gigabyte 8mm tape drive. Nightly runs typically complete in three to four hours. Amanda is currently in daily use at sites around the world.

Reference-contexts: They don't want to deal with a central authority for space or CPU cycles, or be at the whim of some file server in the basement. Since most file writes are local, network traffic is lower and expensive synchronous NFS file writes are avoided, improving performance <ref> [3] </ref>. With the datafull model we are able to have each fileserver support over 40 machines if needed, while in dataless and diskless environments only specialized fileservers can support more than 20 workstations. The big disadvantage is the difficulty of managing and backing up all the datafull workstations.

Reference-contexts: Many workstations cannot produce backup data as quickly as tapes can write [7]. For example, typical backup rates (both full and incremental) on our network range between about 5of the rated 246 KB per second of our Exabyte EXB-8200 8mm tape drives <ref> [4] </ref>. Amanda, the "Advanced Maryland Automated Network Disk Archiver," was developed to solve these problems. To make the project manageable, we first built Amanda on top of the standard BSD Unix dumpprogram.

Reference-contexts: Amanda uses an optional holding disk to run multiple backups in parallel, and copies the backup images from the holding disk to tape, often as fast as the tape can stream. This version was described in <ref> [5] </ref>. More recently, we have be working on generalizing Amanda to handle backup programs other than BSD dump, like gnu tar (and potentially PCs and Macintoshes in the future), and adding support for Kerberos-style authentication and data encryption. <p> This section makes no judgement, but will highlight some of the similarities and the major differences.

Reference-contexts: We found that we could not add workstations to our network backups because the nightly backup would not finish until well after the start of the next work day. Many workstations cannot produce backup data as quickly as tapes can write <ref> [7] </ref>. For example, typical backup rates (both full and incremental) on our network range between about 5of the rated 246 KB per second of our Exabyte EXB-8200 8mm tape drives [4].

Reference-contexts: A solution that many sites have adopted is a dataless workstation model, in which all user data is stored on file servers, with small local disks to hold temporary files and frequently used binaries, or even a diskless workstation model, where the workstations have no disks at all <ref> [11] </ref>. These network organizations require fast file servers with large disks, and generate heavy network traffic. Our department, on the other hand, has always used datafull workstations, where all user data, temporary files, and some binaries, are stored on the workstations. File servers only provide shared binaries. <p> This section makes no judgement, but will highlight some of the similarities and the major differences.
