Abstract: The 1935 result of Erd-os and Szekeres that any sequence of n 2 + 1 real numbers contains a monotonic subsequence of n + 1 terms has stimulated extensive further research, including a paper of J. B. Kruskal that defined an extension of monotonicity for higher dimensions. This paper provides a proof of a weakened form of Kruskal's conjecture for 2-dimensional Euclidean space by showing that there exist sequences of n points in the plane for which the longest monotonic subsequences have length n 1=2 + 3. Weaker results are obtained for higher dimensions. When points are selected at random from reasonable distributions, the average length of the longest monotonic subsequence is shown to be ~ 2n 1=2 as n ! 1 for each dimension.

Reference-contexts: The same methods can also be used to study the expected lengths of unimodal and related subsequences, if those notions are extended to R d in the same way.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A sequence y 1 ; : : : ; y k of real numbers is said to be monotonic if either y 1 y 2 y k or y 1 y 2 y k . A classic theorem of Erd-os and Szekeres <ref> [4] </ref> states that every sequence of m 2 + 1 real numbers has a monotonic subsequence of m + 1 terms. Moreover, there do exist sequences of m 2 real numbers with no monotonic subsequences of length greater than m. <p> With this definition of monotonicity, any sequence of d + 1 points is monotonic. Also, since any nonzero w can be chosen, it is immediate by the Erd-os-Szekeres result <ref> [4] </ref> that a monotonic subsequence of dn 1=2 e points can be chosen from any sequence of n points.
