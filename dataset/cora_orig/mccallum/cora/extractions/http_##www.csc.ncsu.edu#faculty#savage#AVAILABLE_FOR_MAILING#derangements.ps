Abstract: We consider the derangements graph in which the vertices are permutations of f1 : : :ng. Two vertices are joined by an edge if the corresponding permutations differ in every position. The derangements graph is known to be hamil-tonian and it follows from a recent result of Jung that every pair of vertices is joined by a Hamilton path. We use this result to settle an open question, by showing that it is possible, for any n and k satisfying 2 k n and k 6= 3, to generate permutations of f1 : : : ng so that successive permutations differ in k consecutive positions. In fact, the associated k-consecutive derangements graph is also Hamilton-connected.

Reference-contexts: G (n; n) is connected since the derangements form a generating set, as shown in Section 1. The degree of a vertex is just the number of derangements of h1 : : : ni, which is (see, e.g., <ref> [Ha] </ref>, pp. 9-10) For n 4 this is at least n!(1 1=1! + 1=2! 1=3! + 1=4! 1=5!) = 11n!=30 &gt; (n! + 1)=3: So by Theorem 2, it remains to show that G (n; n) is 3-connected.

Reference-contexts: To simultaneously generalize the problems of generating permutations, at one extreme, by adjacent transpositions and, at the other extreme, by derangements, we considered generating permutations by k-derangements in <ref> [Sa] </ref>. Call a permutation 2 S n a k-derangement if has exactly n k fixed points. For k 6= 3 and 2 k n, the set of k-derangements forms a generating set for S n . For example, consider the adjacent transposition (j j + 1). <p> (j j + 1) is the product of the two k-derangements: (j j + 1) = [(i + k 1 : : : i + 1 i) 2 ] [(i i + 1 : : : i + k 1) 2 (j j + 1)]: It was shown independently in <ref> [Sa] </ref> and [Pu1] that the Cayley graph of S n with respect to the generating set of k-derangements is hamiltonian. (This does not follow from Jackson's theorem unless k = n or k = n 1, as noted in [Sa].) However, it was left open whether this result would still hold <p> 1) 2 (j j + 1)]: It was shown independently in <ref> [Sa] </ref> and [Pu1] that the Cayley graph of S n with respect to the generating set of k-derangements is hamiltonian. (This does not follow from Jackson's theorem unless k = n or k = n 1, as noted in [Sa].) However, it was left open whether this result would still hold if one only considers the subset of k-derangements in which the non-fixed points are consecutive. 3 Call a permutation 2 S n a k-consecutive derangement if the non-fixed points of are i; i + 1; : : : ; <p> The argument above shows that the set of k-consecutive derangements is also a generating set of S n for k 6= 3; 2 k n. We call the Cayley graph of S n with respect to this generating set the k-consecutive derangements graph and it was asked in <ref> [Sa] </ref> whether this graph is hamiltonian. The answer was shown to be yes for even values of k in [Pu2]. We show in Section 2 that the k-consecutive derangements graph is hamiltonian for k 6= 3; 2 k n. In fact, it is Hamilton-connected for all k 4.

Reference-contexts: This gives an efficient algorithm for generating permutations and at the same time shows that the Cayley graph of S n with respect to the generating set f (j j + 1) : 1 j &lt; ng is hamiltonian. Techniques for still more efficient permutation generation are surveyed in <ref> [Se] </ref>. In this paper we focus on two other Cayley graphs of S n : the derangements graph and a generalization, the k-consecutive derangements graph. We will use both straight line notation and cycle notation for permutations.
