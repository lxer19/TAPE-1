Reference-contexts: The cost of a sequence is an upper bound on the resulting increase in the weight of the tree. Our goal is to find a feasible legal sequence of minimum cost. For brevity, we call such a sequence a minimum-cost sequence. The problem reduces to a minimum-cost flow problem <ref> [1] </ref> in a flow network that we call the adoption network for T . The adoption network is defined as follows. Starting with G, replace each edge (u; v) by two directed edges (u; v) and (v; u), each with cost w (u; v) and infinite capacity. <p> The cost of the flow is the sum, over all edges, of the cost of the edge times the flow on the edge. Since the demands are integers, there exists an integer-valued minimum-cost feasible flow <ref> [1] </ref>. Assuming that each degree constraint is at least 1, their exists such a flow that is also legal. For brevity, we call such a flow a minimum-cost flow. Lemma 1 The following statements are true: 1. The adoption sequences correspond to integer-valued flows. <p> It can be verified that this sequence of adoptions preserves legality and feasibility, and does not increase cost. 5 3 Polynomial-Time Algorithm An acyclic, integer, minimum-cost flow can be found in polynomial time <ref> [1] </ref>. The corresponding legal, feasible adoption sequence can be performed in polynomial time as described in the proof of the second part of Lemma 1.

Reference-contexts: Computational results for some heuristics for the general problem are presented in [14, 19, 21]. Papadimitriou and Vazirani [15] raised the problem of finding the complexity of computing a minimum-weight degree-4 spanning tree of points in the plane. Some geometric aspects are considered in <ref> [10, 13, 17] </ref>. In this paper, we consider modifying a given spanning tree T , to meet the degree constraints. <p> Our polynomial-time algorithm performs an optimal sequence of adoptions. Adoptions have been previously used to obtain bounded-degree trees in weighted graphs <ref> [10, 16, 18] </ref>. The main contributions of this paper are a careful analysis of the power of adoptions and a network-flow technique for selecting an optimal sequence of adoptions. The method yields a stronger performance guarantee and may yield better results in practice. <p> The performance guarantee of our algorithm is better. In Euclidean graphs (induced by points in IR d ), minimum spanning trees are known to have bounded degree. For such graphs, Khuller, Raghavachari and Young <ref> [10] </ref> gave a linear-time algorithm to find a degree-3 spanning tree of weight at most 5=3 times the weight of a minimum spanning tree. <p> w (T 3 ) &lt; 3 For the case of Euclidean distances in the plane, we get bounded degree trees that satisfy * w (T 3 ) &lt; 5 * w (T 4 ) &lt; 4 The latter two bounds are worse than those shown by Khuller, Raghavachari and Young <ref> [10] </ref> using the geometry of point arrangements. (It was shown that 3 2 and 5 4 are upper bounds.) We conjecture that the following are the optimal ratios: Conjecture 6.2 For the case of Euclidean distances in the plane, we conjecture that there exist bounded degree trees that satisfy * w
