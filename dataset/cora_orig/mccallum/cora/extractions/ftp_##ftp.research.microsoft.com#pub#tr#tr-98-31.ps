Reference-contexts: There are several classes of graphical models defined by a set of conditional independence constraints that can accommodate a combination of discrete and continuous variables using Conditional-Gaussian distributions. Among these models, in addition to the models discussed in the previous sections, are AMP chain graphs <ref> (Andersson, Madigan, and Perlman, 1996) </ref>, 12 and reciprocal graphs (Koster, 1997). These graphical models all correspond to semi-algebraic sets because independence facts in CG-distributions are expressible as polynomial equalities. We now discuss graphical models with hidden variables.

Reference-contexts: Note that if f is a polynomial map then f is a semi-algebraic map because its graph can be described by m polynomial equalities: y j f j (x) = 0, where 1 j m. A key result about semi-algebraic sets is given by the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem <ref> (see, e.g., Benedetti and Risler, 1990) </ref>. 10 Theorem 5 (Tarski-Seidenberg) Let f : X ! Y be a semi-algebraic map. Then the image f (X) Y is a semi-algebraic set. We note that some smooth manifolds are semi-algebraic sets and some are not. <p> A stratified set is a set that has a stratification. The dimension of a stratified set is d 1 | the largest dimension of a stratum. A key theorem about semi-algebraic sets is the Stratification theorem <ref> (see Benedetti and Risler, 1990) </ref>. Theorem 6 (Stratification) Every semi-algebraic set has a semi-algebraic stratification. We note that if E is a stratified set and f is a diffeomorphism, then f (E) is also a stratified set.

Reference-contexts: Conditional-Gaussian DAG models and Conditional-Gaussian chain graphs are also curved exponential models. Curved exponential families were studied by Efron who explored geometrical interpretation of various statistical measures using these families <ref> (e.g., Efron, 1978) </ref>. A treatment of this topic is given by Kass and Vos (1997). We study curved exponential models because the standard asymptotic theory is valid for these models.

Reference-contexts: For example, for naive Bayes models g is replaced with g n;k;k 1 ;:::;k n . We have implemented the algorithm in Mathematica and used it to find the dimension of several graphical models with hidden variables. Here we summarize the results for g n;k;k 1 ;:::;k n . <ref> (Implementation details can be found in Geiger, Heckerman, and Meek, 1996) </ref>. For k = 2, the maximal rank of g n;k computed by the algorithm was full, namely, all results were consistent with the formula min (2n + 1; 2 n 1).

Reference-contexts: The relationship of these alternatives and a method, called implicitization, for finding constraints from a mapping f is discussed in <ref> (Geiger and Meek, 1998) </ref> . In this section we recall the definitions of smooth manifolds and show that DAG models correspond to smooth manifolds and are therefore curved exponential families (and not linear exponential families). Conditional-Gaussian DAG models and Conditional-Gaussian chain graphs are also curved exponential models.

Reference-contexts: We provide a classification of graphical models according to their representation as exponential families. Undirected graphical models with no hidden variables are known to be linear exponential families (LEFs) <ref> (see Lauritzen, 1996) </ref>, directed acyclic graphical models and chain graphs with no hidden variables, including DAG models with several families of local distributions, are shown to be curved exponential families (CEFs), and graph 1 ical models with hidden variables are, what we term stratified exponential families (SEFs). <p> Dividing each equation by (w 0 ) 2 and taking the log, yields 8 linear equations in terms of the natural parameters i = log w i =w 0 . In general, multinomial graphical models are log-affine models which are LEFs <ref> (Lauritzen, 1996, pp 76) </ref>. A Gaussian undirected graphical model is a family of multivariate non-singular Gaussian distributions in which some of the off-diagonal elements t ij of the precision matrix (the inverse of the covariance matrix) are set to zero. <p> For details see <ref> (Lauritzen, 1996, pp. 124-132) </ref>. A Conditional Gaussian undirected graphical model is a family of Conditional Gaussian (CG) distributions over a set of discrete and continuous variables defined by a set of saturated independence constraints stating that variables i and j are conditionally independent given the remaining variables.

Reference-contexts: (mn)fin jI mn ] where I mn is the identity matrix of size m n. 3.2 Discrete DAG models A Discrete DAG model B (fi; n; m) is a mapping B n;m : fi R n ! R m where fi, n, m and B n;m are given as follows <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>. Let (x 1 ; : : :; x k ) be an ordered sequence of discrete variables each having a finite set of values. <p> When the number of reference states is zero, namely each f i is the constant function, we get a discrete DAG model. In the case of a noisy-or model, the reference states are the states where exactly one parent is on and the other parents are off <ref> (see Pearl 1988) </ref>. For leaky noisy-or model the reference states also include the state when all the parents of x i are off. <p> We outline the needed extensions. First, we note that it suffices to examine the Markov blanket X of H <ref> (see Pearl, 1988) </ref> . The reason being that we can make a target coordinate change from p (x; y) to p (x) and p (yjx) where y is a value of Y and Y are all nodes not in the Markov blanket of H. This is a diffeomorphism.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, graphical models based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which are called DAG models or Bayesian networks, are useful for modeling causal relationships. For this reason, the problem of model selection has been examined for the purpose of identifying cause and effect from observational data <ref> (e.g., Spirtes et al., 1993) </ref>. (e.g., Spirtes et al., 1993, Pearl, 1997). We provide a classification of graphical models according to their representation as exponential families. <p> For this reason, the problem of model selection has been examined for the purpose of identifying cause and effect from observational data (e.g., Spirtes et al., 1993). <ref> (e.g., Spirtes et al., 1993, Pearl, 1997) </ref>. We provide a classification of graphical models according to their representation as exponential families. <p> Similarly, we note that Gaussian DAG model with hidden variables also correspond to semi-algebraic sets due to their parametric definition via a polynomial mapping called the trek-rule <ref> (see, e.g., Spirtes et al. 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the image of these graphical models can be described with a set of polynomial equalities and polynomial inequalities.
