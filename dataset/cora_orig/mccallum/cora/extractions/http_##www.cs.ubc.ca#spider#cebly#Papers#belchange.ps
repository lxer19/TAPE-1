Abstract: Belief revision and belief update have been proposed as two types of belief change serving different purposes, revision intended to capture changes in belief state reflecting new information about a static world, and update intended to capture changes of belief in response to a changing world. We argue that routine belief change involves elements of both and present a model of generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform an agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change. We show that, under certain assumptions, the original update postulates are satisfied. We also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model. We also draw parallels to models of stochastic dynamical systems, and use this to develop a model that deals with iterated update and noisy observations in (qualitative settings) that is analogous to Bayesian updating in a quantitative setting. fl Some parts of this report appeared in preliminary form in Generalized Update: Belief Change in Dynamic Settings, Proc. of Fourteenth International Joint Conf. on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-95), Montreal, pp.1550-1556 (1995).

Reference-contexts: These notions are strongly reminiscent of standard concepts from probability theory. In fact, a -ranking can be interpreted as a semi-qualitative probability distribution. Using the "-semantics of Adams <ref> [1] </ref>, Goldszmidt and Pearl [17] show how one can interpret the (unconditional and conditional) values of propositions as order of magnitude probabilities. Under this interpretation, one is able to define analogs of various probabilistic operations, including conditionalization (see Section 5).

Reference-contexts: If an agent observes that this belief is mistaken, it must take steps to correct the misconception. Such a process is know as belief revision, of which the theory of Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makin-son <ref> [2, 15] </ref> is the best-known characterization. On the other hand, an agent's beliefs, while correct at one time, may have become inaccurate due to changes in the world. As events occur and other agents act, or as the agent itself takes actions, certain facts become true and others false.

Reference-contexts: By ranking situations according to their degree of plausibility, we obtain a natural way of assessing degrees of belief and a very natural semantics for belief revision. Such models have been used extensively for revision <ref> [20, 15, 6] </ref>. To this we add the notion of a transition or evolution from one world state to another. As proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM), updates reflect changes in the world, and transitions can be used to model such changes. <p> If one of two beliefs must be retracted in order to accommodate some new fact, the less entrenched belief will be relinquished, while the more entrenched persists. Semantically, an entrenchment relation (hence a revision function) can be modeled using an ordering on possible worlds reflecting their relative plausibility <ref> [20, 6] </ref>. However, rather than use a qualitative ranking relation, we adopt the presentation of [31, 18] and rank all possible worlds using a - ranking. Such a ranking : W ! N assigns to each world a natural number reflecting its plausibility or degree of believability. <p> It is normally assumed that kAk"W 6= ; for every satisfiable A thus every proposition is accorded some degree of plausibility. It is well-known that this type of model induces the class of revision functions sanctioned by the AGM postulates <ref> [20, 6, 18] </ref>. 2 The ranking function can naturally be interpreted as characterizing the degree to which an agent is willing to accept certain alternative states of affairs as epistemically possible. As such it seems to be appropriate for modeling changes in belief about an unchanging world. <p> This model captures that fact that she strongly believes she left her book and glasses in the same place; that is, the belief Patio (B) Patio (G) is more entrenched than either of the beliefs Patio (B) or Patio (G). 2 We refer to <ref> [4, 6, 12, 19] </ref> for a discussion of languages with which one can express properties of belief sets and revision functions. These languages can be used to express belief, degrees of entrenchment and plausibility, conditional belief, and so on. <p> Models based on pure ranking information, without quantitative degrees of belief, are often used in belief revision (see, for instance, the semantics for AGM revision given in <ref> [20, 6] </ref> or the plausibility measures of [13]). To compare the relative plausibility of transitions in such a setting, we must have a way of trading off the relative likelihoods of initial conditions, events, event outcomes, and so forth.

Reference-contexts: As proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM), updates reflect changes in the world, and transitions can be used to model such changes. However, in contrast to the KM model and following our earlier work <ref> [8] </ref>, we assume that the relative plausibility of transitions (and hence possible updates) is not something that is judged directly; rather we assume that events or actions provide the impetus for change. <p> The converse also holds: any KM operator can be represented by such a semantic model. Moreover, if the orderings w are total preorders (so that all elements are comparable), then update operators are characterized by (U1)-(U9) (see <ref> [21, 8] </ref>): (U9) If KB is complete, (KB A) 6` :B and (KB A) ` C then (KB (A ^ B)) ` C We assume for the most part that we are dealing with such total update operators (but we discuss this further in Section 4). <p> This semantics supposes that it is natural to directly rank possible evolutions of a world w. In <ref> [8] </ref> we argue that evolutions or changes in the world should not be ranked directly. We suppose that events or actions provide the impetus for change, and the plausibility of a given evolution is determined by the plausibility of the event that caused the change. <p> Apart from providing a more intuitive semantic foundation for belief update, this event-based model is more general than the KM model, and can be used to show that some of the KM postulates are too restrictive to be viewed as a general characterization of the process of belief update <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to unify update and revision, rather than generalizing the KM update semantics directly, we will base our unifying model on the event-based semantics of [8]. We briefly review the basic elements of this semantics. 3 We assume a set of events E. <p> show that some of the KM postulates are too restrictive to be viewed as a general characterization of the process of belief update <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to unify update and revision, rather than generalizing the KM update semantics directly, we will base our unifying model on the event-based semantics of [8]. We briefly review the basic elements of this semantics. 3 We assume a set of events E. An event e maps each world into another world, and can be viewed as a function (perhaps partial), e : W ! W . <p> In particular, we can define an outcome ranking w for world w over the set W , where w (v) denotes the degree of plausibility 3 Our presentation will rely on the use of -rankings (which impose total preorders), whereas the semantics in <ref> [8] </ref> is purely qualitative (and permits preorders as plausibility relations). In the few places where this influences results, we will make the distinction clear. 4 In [8], nondeterministic actions are captured by allowing set-valued outcomes. <p> (v) denotes the degree of plausibility 3 Our presentation will rely on the use of -rankings (which impose total preorders), whereas the semantics in <ref> [8] </ref> is purely qualitative (and permits preorders as plausibility relations).

We refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for further details. One can show that the event-based semantics for update generalizes the KM model. Under particular assumptions, the classes of update operators determined by each semantics coincide, though some of the necessary requirements on event models may, in certain cases, be unnecessarily restrictive [8]. <p> We refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for further details. One can show that the event-based semantics for update generalizes the KM model. Under particular assumptions, the classes of update operators determined by each semantics coincide, though some of the necessary requirements on event models may, in certain cases, be unnecessarily restrictive [8]. We defer discussion of this issue until we examine our generalization of this event-based semantics below. <p> Note that one cannot escape the dilemma by supposing there is no such transition, for postulate (U3) ensures that updating acid by blue is consistent <ref> [8] </ref>. We can relax the KM update model to allow certain KB-worlds to be ruled out if the observation is not reachable through any reasonable transition from that world. This would dictate the addition of machinery to give a meaningful interpretation to the term reasonable. But we must go further. <p> The analysis of the update postulates is in many ways similar to that presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, where the simple event-based semantics of Section 2.3 was developed. There we showed that under certain assumptions this event-based operator satisfies the KM postulates, though we argued that these assumptions are not always appropriate. <p> Proposition 4.1 If is the GU operator induced by some GU model then satisfies postulates (U1), (U4), (U5), (U6), (U7) and (U9). We note that GU satisfies the all of the same update postulates as the basic event-model for flat belief states <ref> [8] </ref>. One key difference between the GU model and the KM model is reflected in (U2), which asserts that KB A is equivalent to KB whenever KB entails A. <p> Proposition 4.3 If is induced by a complete GU model then satisfies (U3). In <ref> [8] </ref> we criticized (U3) as inappropriate for the update of flat belief sets. For example, if our beliefs corresponded to a single world where acid is believed, (U3) forces the observation of blue to behave quite poorly (as described above). <p> There are a number of systematic ways in which one can enforce the condition of completeness such as requiring the existence of miraculous events that can cause anything <ref> [8] </ref>. In our setting, one quite reasonable condition we might impose is that all worlds have some plausibility (i.e., is a total function on W ) and that the null event is possible (though not necessarily very plausible) at each of those.

Reference-contexts: This is one area of belief revision and belief update that has received virtually no attention. There have been attempts to provide general semantics for belief change operators (e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>); but often these models are such that under certain assumptions the change is a revision and under others it 4 is an update. In Section 6 we compare some of these related models to GU. We conclude in Section 7 with some directions for future research. <p> This model captures that fact that she strongly believes she left her book and glasses in the same place; that is, the belief Patio (B) Patio (G) is more entrenched than either of the beliefs Patio (B) or Patio (G). 2 We refer to <ref> [4, 6, 12, 19] </ref> for a discussion of languages with which one can express properties of belief sets and revision functions. These languages can be used to express belief, degrees of entrenchment and plausibility, conditional belief, and so on. <p> In order to specify such a model in a convenient way, we would have to develop additional machinery. We do not pursue this here, though it could be developed in a less awkward fashion in the run-based model of Friedman and Halpern <ref> [12] </ref> (which is described below). Instead, we will present a second alternative, based directly on standard stochastic observation 18 A distinct observational proposition is necessary, since conditioning on obsWetG removes all worlds where obsDryG holds. Subsequent conditioning on obsDryG would result in inconsistent beliefs. 29 models. <p> However, there have been few attempts to tie all of these ideas together in a comprehensive, qualitative framework. There is one framework in which belief update and belief revision can both be expressed, namely, the run-based (or trajectory-based) model of Friedman and Halpern <ref> [12] </ref>. This model is similar to ours, especially in its general outlook on revision and update and its adoption of a dynamical systems perspective.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we have made an assumption of stationarity: the system dynamics and observation model do not change over time. Again, while this assumption is relatively uncontroversial, the Friedman-Halpern model can very easily deal with nonstationary systems. We note that in subsequent work <ref> [14] </ref>, Friedman and Halpern address the difficulty of associating plausibility with entire trajectories and come to precisely the same conclusions: the Markovian and stationarity assumptions are very natural and provide great leverage in specifying system dynamics (and for their model, easily allow one to determine the plausibility of trajectories). <p> Simple ranking information does not allow one to do so; direct judgements of the plausibility of these combinations must be made. A more general qualitative theory would do just thatan example of such a theory is the plausibility measure approach recently proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. The -approach presented here is a special case of this more general model. However, the essential spirit of such a proposal is identical to that underlying our presentation.

Reference-contexts: The assumptions that frameworks for qualitative belief change, like GU and the Friedman-Halpern system, show to be effective in modeling belief change are exactly those that have been adopted in the dynamical systems community for years. Finally, we note that Geffner <ref> [16] </ref> has recently developed a model for reasoning about action using the -calculus to represent the defeasibility of action effects. By making the Markov assumption explicit, he uses this model to determine the plausibility of system trajectories. <p> Appropriate 22 Distances of this type are, however, not generally symmetric. 36 representation languages for the concise expression of events (with defeasible effects), defeasible be-liefs and other aspects of the model must still be developed. The specification language proposed by Geffner <ref> [16] </ref> would seem to be a useful way of representing the system dynamics component of a GU model. Many of the other components of such languages are already in place, based primarily on conditional and dynamic logics, and other languages for actions and defeasible beliefs.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we present the AGM theory of revision and the KM theory of update, focusing primarily on the semantic models that have been proposed. In our presentation, we adopt the qualitative probabilistic model of <ref> [31, 18, 19] </ref>. In Section 3 we present our model of generalized update, with an emphasis on semantics, and contrast it with the flat KM model. We describe two examples to illustrate the key features of the model. In Section 4 we analyze the GU operator in detail. <p> We present both the syntactic postulates and the semantic models that characterize these theories and describe briefly the -calculus of <ref> [31, 18, 19] </ref>, which provides an alternative model for the ordering relationships used by both theories. Throughout, we assume that an agent has a deductively closed belief set K, a set of sentences drawn from some logical language reflecting the agent's beliefs about the current state of the world. <p> Semantically, an entrenchment relation (hence a revision function) can be modeled using an ordering on possible worlds reflecting their relative plausibility [20, 6]. However, rather than use a qualitative ranking relation, we adopt the presentation of <ref> [31, 18] </ref> and rank all possible worlds using a - ranking. Such a ranking : W ! N assigns to each world a natural number reflecting its plausibility or degree of believability. If (w) &lt; (v) then w is more plausible than v or more consistent with the agent's beliefs. <p> It is normally assumed that kAk"W 6= ; for every satisfiable A thus every proposition is accorded some degree of plausibility. It is well-known that this type of model induces the class of revision functions sanctioned by the AGM postulates <ref> [20, 6, 18] </ref>. 2 The ranking function can naturally be interpreted as characterizing the degree to which an agent is willing to accept certain alternative states of affairs as epistemically possible. As such it seems to be appropriate for modeling changes in belief about an unchanging world. <p> We will describe several methods of effecting iterated revision (and, in particular, revision of epis-temic states) within the GU framework below. In particular, two models of iterated revision within the theory of -rankings, as developed by Spohn [31] (and further investigated by Goldszmidt and Pearl <ref> [18, 19] </ref>), can be applied almost directly to GU. However, the application of these techniques to GU can be better motivated by illustrating the connections of GU to stochastic dynamical systems, which we do in the next section.

Throughout, we assume that an agent has a deductively closed belief set K, a set of sentences drawn from some logical language reflecting the agent's beliefs about the current state of the world. <p> This model captures that fact that she strongly believes she left her book and glasses in the same place; that is, the belief Patio (B) Patio (G) is more entrenched than either of the beliefs Patio (B) or Patio (G). 2 We refer to <ref> [4, 6, 12, 19] </ref> for a discussion of languages with which one can express properties of belief sets and revision functions. These languages can be used to express belief, degrees of entrenchment and plausibility, conditional belief, and so on. <p> Under this interpretation, one is able to define analogs of various probabilistic operations, including conditionalization (see Section 5). We do not delve into the details of -arithmetic here, nor the details of the precise relationship of these ranking functions to probability distributions. We refer to <ref> [31, 17, 19] </ref> for details. We do note, however, that addition, multiplication and division of probabilities correspond to the minimum, addition and subtraction operations, respectively, for -rankings. Thus the definition of (BjA) above can be seen as a direct counterpart of the usual definition of conditional probability. <p> We will describe several methods of effecting iterated revision (and, in particular, revision of epis-temic states) within the GU framework below. In particular, two models of iterated revision within the theory of -rankings, as developed by Spohn [31] (and further investigated by Goldszmidt and Pearl <ref> [18, 19] </ref>), can be applied almost directly to GU. However, the application of these techniques to GU can be better motivated by illustrating the connections of GU to stochastic dynamical systems, which we do in the next section. <p> Recall that refers to the updated ranking before revision by the operation (as defined by Equa tion 2). We define ( 1 if w 6j= A This process of conditioning (in a static context) is described in <ref> [19] </ref>. Intuitively, the agent's initial ranking is updated, then the observation A is applied to the updated ranking by removing all :A-worlds (the remaining worlds are normalized by subtracting (A) so that a legitimate ranking results). We dub this process infallible GU because all observations are treated as being certain. <p> Intuitively, the relative plausibility of all A-worlds is shifted by ff (so that if ff is positive, A becomes more plausible). This process is dubbed J -conditioning in <ref> [19] </ref> (as it is exactly analogous to Jeffrey conditioning of a probability distribution). In [19] a similar process known as L-conditioning is also proposed, whereby A does not become ff degrees more plausible, but A is made to plausible to degree ff. <p> Intuitively, the relative plausibility of all A-worlds is shifted by ff (so that if ff is positive, A becomes more plausible). This process is dubbed J -conditioning in <ref> [19] </ref> (as it is exactly analogous to Jeffrey conditioning of a probability distribution). In [19] a similar process known as L-conditioning is also proposed, whereby A does not become ff degrees more plausible, but A is made to plausible to degree ff. <p> In this way, 31 instead of direct conditioning by A (and its attendant difficulties), J-conditioning or L-conditioning may be used. We do not pursue this suggestion here; the reader is referred to <ref> [31, 19] </ref> for details of this type of conditioning. The application of these ideas to GU is straightforward. However, a key question that arises is the following: how does one determine the strength of an observation? The obvious answer is that one must have an observation model.

Reference-contexts: By ranking situations according to their degree of plausibility, we obtain a natural way of assessing degrees of belief and a very natural semantics for belief revision. Such models have been used extensively for revision <ref> [20, 15, 6] </ref>. To this we add the notion of a transition or evolution from one world state to another. As proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM), updates reflect changes in the world, and transitions can be used to model such changes. <p> If one of two beliefs must be retracted in order to accommodate some new fact, the less entrenched belief will be relinquished, while the more entrenched persists. Semantically, an entrenchment relation (hence a revision function) can be modeled using an ordering on possible worlds reflecting their relative plausibility <ref> [20, 6] </ref>. However, rather than use a qualitative ranking relation, we adopt the presentation of [31, 18] and rank all possible worlds using a - ranking. Such a ranking : W ! N assigns to each world a natural number reflecting its plausibility or degree of believability. <p> It is normally assumed that kAk"W 6= ; for every satisfiable A thus every proposition is accorded some degree of plausibility. It is well-known that this type of model induces the class of revision functions sanctioned by the AGM postulates <ref> [20, 6, 18] </ref>. 2 The ranking function can naturally be interpreted as characterizing the degree to which an agent is willing to accept certain alternative states of affairs as epistemically possible. As such it seems to be appropriate for modeling changes in belief about an unchanging world. <p> Models based on pure ranking information, without quantitative degrees of belief, are often used in belief revision (see, for instance, the semantics for AGM revision given in <ref> [20, 6] </ref> or the plausibility measures of [13]). To compare the relative plausibility of transitions in such a setting, we must have a way of trading off the relative likelihoods of initial conditions, events, event outcomes, and so forth.

Reference-contexts: An agent observing such processes or their results must take steps to ensure its state of belief reflects these changes. This process is known as belief update, as proposed by Winslett [33] and Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [21] </ref>. On the surface, formalizations of revision and update are quite similar: in both cases, the objective is to define a function that, given the agent's belief state and an observed proposition, returns a new belief state. <p> With quantitative -rankings, this is straightforward, whereas qualitative rankings do not permit this unless explicit calibration information is provided. We elaborate on this in Sections 4 and 5. 2.2 Belief Update Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [21] </ref> have proposed a general characterization of belief update that seems appropriate when an agent wishes to change its beliefs to reflect changes in, or evolution of, the world.

Following 8 [21], we describe update in terms of a knowledge base KB rather than a deductively closed belief set K. <p> The converse also holds: any KM operator can be represented by such a semantic model. Moreover, if the orderings w are total preorders (so that all elements are comparable), then update operators are characterized by (U1)-(U9) (see <ref> [21, 8] </ref>): (U9) If KB is complete, (KB A) 6` :B and (KB A) ` C then (KB (A ^ B)) ` C We assume for the most part that we are dealing with such total update operators (but we discuss this further in Section 4).

Reference-contexts: This is a crucial drawback, for even though one may not care about outdated beliefs directly, information gained about one's prior state of belief can influence updated beliefs.

Reference-contexts: state of affairs more attractive than a trajectory-based model: history can be accounted for, but one has the option of distinguishing only relevant historical facts as opposed to considering arbitrary distinctions between entire trajectories. 6.2 Distance-based Semantics Recently, a model of belief revision based on a distance semantics was proposed <ref> [29] </ref>. Roughly, we assume the existence of a metric d over W that specifies the distance between possible worlds. Intuitively, d (w; v) reflects the degree of difficulty or cost to change from situation w to v. <p> Since d is fixed, this model allows for iteration as well. It is shown in <ref> [29] </ref> that, under certain assumptions, such a semantics is equivalent to the AGM model of revision (that is, it satisfies the AGM postulates, and can represent any operator that satisfies the postulates).
