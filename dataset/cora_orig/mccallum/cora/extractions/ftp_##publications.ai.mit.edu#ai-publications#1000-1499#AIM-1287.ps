Abstract: From a statistical point of view this corresponds to computing the Maximum Likelihood estimate, under the assumption of Gaussian noise. However, it is well known that this choice leads to results that are very sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. For this reason it has been proposed to minimize functions of the form P n i=1 V (g i f ), where V is a function that increases less rapidly than the square. Several choices for V have been proposed and successfully used to obtain "robust" estimates. In this paper we show that, for a class of functions V , using these robust estimators corresponds to assuming that data are corrupted by Gaussian noise whose variance fluctuates according to some given probability distribution, that uniquely determines the shape of V . This paper describes research done within the Center for Biological Information Processing, in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. This research is sponsored by a grant from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Cognitive and Neural Sciences Division; by the Artificial Intelligence Center of Hughes Aircraft Corporation (S1-801534-2). Support for the A. I. Laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Army contract DACA76-85-C-0010, and in part by ONR contract N00014-85-K-0124. c fl Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1996
