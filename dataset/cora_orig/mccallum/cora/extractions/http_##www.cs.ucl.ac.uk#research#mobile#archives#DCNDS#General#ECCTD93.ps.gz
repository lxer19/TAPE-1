Reference-contexts: A third method is to send a signal with a complex envelope x (t) that has a sharp autocorrelation function. One way to construct such an x (t) is to have x (t) = k=1 where p (t) is 1 on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and 0 elsewhere, and the s k are from a binary maximal length shift register sequence, with the 0 and 1's mapped into +1 and -1.

Reference-contexts: Thus the magnitude square of a i (t) has a centered chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom, and its phase is uniformly distributed on <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. The distribution of the magnitude is Rayleigh, and the name of the model is "Rayleigh fading channel". <p> For a pure carrier at frequency f c , the complex signal envelope is then x (t) = Ae j2f c v Reflections of the signal occur near the receiver, and the angle of arrival can be considered as uniformly distributed on <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. The correlation of the received signal is R x (t 1 ; t 2 ) = EjAj 2 e j2f c v c (t 1 t 2 ) cos (ff) where J 0 is a Bessel function and f d = f c v=c = v=.
