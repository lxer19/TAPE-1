Title: Simulating Boolean Circuits on a DNA Computer  
Author: Mitsunori Ogihara Animesh Ray 
Abstract: We demonstrate that DNA computers can simulate Boolean circuits with a small overhead. Boolean circuits embody the notion of massively parallel signal processing and are frequently encountered in many parallel algorithms. Many important problems such as sorting, integer arithmetic, and matrix multiplication are known to be computable by small size Boolean circuits much faster than by ordinary sequential digital computers. This paper shows that DNA chemistry allows one to simulate large semi-unbounded fan-in Boolean circuits with a logarithmic slowdown in computation time. Also, for the class NC 1 , the slowdown can be reduced to a constant. In this algorithm we have encoded the inputs, the Boolean AND gates, and the OR gates to DNA oligonucleotide sequences. We operate on the gates and the inputs by standard molecular techniques of sequence-specific annealing, ligation, separation by size, amplification, sequence-specific cleavage, and detection by size. Additional steps of amplification are not necessary for NC 1 circuits. The feasibility of the DNA algorithm has been successfully tested on a small circuit by actual biochemical experiments.

Reference-contexts: There has been much discussion on the feasibility of the "extract" operation [Adl96, Rei95, BL95, KKW96] because its error rate, even with the current best Recombinant DNA technique, is as large as 10 6 (see, <ref> [ABL + 94] </ref>) which is high enough to fail the whole computation. Second, Boneh et al. [BDLS96] presented a method for evaluating a Boolean circuit with many inputs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Adleman <ref> [Adl94] </ref>, subsequently Lipton [Lip95] showed the potential of Recombinant DNA-based combinatorial chemistry as a tool for solving com putationally difficult search problems. The massive parallelism of liquid phase DNA chemistry, coupled with the encoding of information in DNA strands, raises the hope for solving "intractable" problems. <p> This property allows us to conduct separation by gel electrophoresis, not by extract. Gel electrophoresis is a well-established biochemical method for ordering DNA strands according to the length. Adleman <ref> [Adl94] </ref> employed this operation for detection and Lipton's 3SAT algorithm [Lip95] uses it for separating legitimate truth assignments from those that are not. In addition to the separation by gel electrophoresis, our algorithm assumes appending (by ligation), cleavage (by restriction enzymes), detection, and amplification as the necessary biochemical operations.

Reference-contexts: Second, Boneh et al. <ref> [BDLS96] </ref> presented a method for evaluating a Boolean circuit with many inputs. In this method, evaluation goes gate by gate, and each DNA strand is the concatenation of the input bits and the values of the Boolean gates that have been evaluated so far.

Reference-contexts: This approach by Boneh et al . is in some sense orthogonal to the approach we are studying in this present paper. Namely, although their method allows concurrent evaluation of the circuit at different inputs, it requires time proportional to the circuit size. Third, Beaver <ref> [Bea96] </ref> proposes a method for simulating with DNA polynomial space bounded computation in polynomial time using site-directed DNA mutagenesis. Although this strong simulation results provide a circuit evaluation method with the same efficiency as the one derived from Reif's result, we are skeptical about feasibility of the mutagenesis operation.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, one trillion wires are beyond the reach of DNA computer as well. However, we note that a technique for parallel synthesis of many DNA sequences currently exists <ref> [CYH + 96] </ref>. Nevertheless, we still argue that our DNA-based evaluation method will be useful, in particular, when we need to evaluate one circuit on many distinct input sets.

Reference-contexts: Artifactual annealing between short stretches of homology in otherwise noncomplementary oligonucleotides maybe avoided by enzymatic annealing catalyzed by the DNA strand transfer protein RecA <ref> [KE94] </ref>. So, we can handle at least one trillion wires by encoding the gates as 40 base oligonucleotide sequences. On the other hand, one trillion wires are perhaps beyond the reach of digital computers.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis may suggest that the fan-out will play a crucial role when measuring the efficiency of circuit simulations on DNA computers. The result gives us an added bonus: a real-time simulation of the class NC 1 <ref> [Pip79] </ref>. NC 1 is the class of problems solved by bounded fan-in circuits of O (log n) depth and polynomial-size. Many fundamental computational problems from the integer arithmetic to sorting are known to belong to this class [BCH86, AKS83]. <p> Corollary 2 For every k 0, SAC k can be simulated by a DNA computer in time O (log k+1 n) and space polynomial in n. The above analysis gives us an added bonus. The class NC <ref> [Pip79] </ref> is the counterpart of SAC in the bounded fan-in circuit model. There is a vast literature on NC 1 classes and numerous problems from the integer arithmetic to sorting are proven to belong to this class.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of a PRAM algorithm is measured by the number of processors involved and the running time. Recently, Reif <ref> [Rei95] </ref> formulated an abstract parallel DNA computation model, the Parallel Associative Memory model (the PAM model, in short). The PAM model, in addition to the standard Recombinant DNA operations, assumes an operation called PA-Match, which is a generalized form of ligation of long DNA strands. <p> The question on simulation efficiency was addressed in the past by Reif <ref> [Rei95] </ref>. First, combined with the fact that Boolean circuits of size m and depth d can be simulated by CREW PRAM algorithms with O (m log m) processors in time O (d log m) (see [SV84]), the results of Reif [Rei95] indicate that the PAM model can simulate Boolean circuits of <p> on simulation efficiency was addressed in the past by Reif <ref> [Rei95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, no strands of length 2L ending with [j s ] are created. Furthermore, no strands of length greater than 2L are created. In the third step, we separate length 2L strands from length L strands. We use denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis <ref> [SFM89] </ref> for that purpose. The strands of length 2L correspond to the gates that evaluate to 1. In the fourth step, we cleave the length 2L strands at ff # fi by restriction enzyme E. <p> The two OR gates were encoded as two 22-mer oligonucleotides each of whose 5 0 and 3 0 ends are 5 0 -AC GT-3 0 . In addition, a phosphate group was attached to each of these two oligonu-cleotides at their 5 0 end <ref> [SFM89] </ref>. These are identified as G 5 and G 6 , respectively. The AND gate (designated, G 7 ) was chosen as a 21-mer oligonu-cleotide of unique sequence whose 5 0 end was attached to a phosphate group with a radioactive phosphorus atom. <p> This is shown in Figure 2. Thus, the edge oligonu-cleotide E 1;5 can hybridize to both G 1 and G 5 , but to no other sequence, 10 such that a DNA joining enzyme (ligase) <ref> [SFM89] </ref> can covalently join the 5 0 phosphate of G 5 to the 3 0 hydroxyl group of I 1 . This will make a 43 base long dimeric oligonucleotide 5 0 I 1 -G 5 -3 0 . <p> To implement the OR gate, we added G 5 ; G 6 ; E 1;5 ; E 2;5 ; E 3;6 , and E 4;6 , allowed annealing and ligation, and separated the products by size on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis <ref> [SFM89] </ref>. Positions of the gel corresponding to the dimer size band were cut out and DNA, if any, was extracted. These solutions were then treated with the enzyme RsaI to cleave any dimer DNA to the monomer length. <p> Ligation was carried out at 23 ffi C for 1 hour. 14 Electrophoresis, detection, recovery and treatment of DNA: The DNA bands were separated by electrophoresis in 15% urea-polyacrylamide gels at 50 Volts and approximately 10 mA current in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer <ref> [SFM89] </ref>. At the end of electrophoresis, an X-ray film was placed on the wet gel in Saran wrap and exposed at the room temperature for 2.5 hours in the dark.

Efficiency of the cleavage reaction can be similarly monitored by fluorescence measurements and the step levels extended by feedback until a preset limit of cleavage is attained.

Also, many combinatorial and mathematical problems are known to belong 8 to SAC. Since the maximum fan-out F is bounded by the size m, and m is a polynomial in n for SAC circuits, we have the following corollary.

Is molecular circuit analysis feasible for a large network on which digital computes are inefficient? By a proof similar to that of the Gilbert-Varshamov Theorem (see <ref> [vL91] </ref>), one can show that there is a set of 1:6fi10 12 distinct 40 base oligonucleotide sequences such that (i) for any two sequences A and B, A disagrees with B and its complement at 10 positions and (ii) no sequence contains the pattern that is cleaved by the restriction enzyme
