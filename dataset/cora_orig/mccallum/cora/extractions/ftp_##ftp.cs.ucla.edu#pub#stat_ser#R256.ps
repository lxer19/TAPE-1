Reference-contexts: This exclusion of variables that are affected by treatments (or exposures) is unavoidable, and has long been recognized as a necessary judgmental input in every analysis of treatment effect, in both observational and experimental studies <ref> [Cox, 1958, p. 48] </ref>. We shall assume throughout that investigators possess the substantive knowledge required for reliably distinguishing between variables that are affected by the treatment X and those that are not.

Reference-contexts: the change-in-parameter method, a derivative of the associational criterion, is the only fundamental definition of confounding (see [Greenland et al., 1989], for critiques of Grayson's position). 3 For simplicity, we will limit our discussion to unadjusted confounding; extensions involving measurement of auxiliary variables are straightforward and can be found elsewhere <ref> [Pearl, 1995; Greenland et al., 1997] </ref>. 2 the response event Y = y under the hypothetical intervention X = x, calculated according to M . <p> We shall see later that this distinction alone is not sufficient for establishing even the weakest test for confounding; knowledge of whether variables affect the outcome Y will also be necessary. 4 Readers unfamiliar with the do (x) operator <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref> may interpret P (yjdo (x)) as the conditional probability P fl (Y = yjX = x) corresponding to a controlled experiment in which X is randomized. <p> Yet, in this example the effect of X on Y is not confounded; the type of car owned by a person has no effect on either exposure or disease and is merely one among many irrelevant properties that are associated with both via intermediaries. Formal analysis (e.g., <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref>) 4 establishes that, indeed, Eq. (1) is satisfied in this model, and, moreover, adjustment for Z would generally yield a biased result: X Thus we see that the traditional criterion based on statistical association fails to identify an unconfounded effect and would tempt one to adjust for the wrong <p> By parameterization we mean an assignment of functions to the links of the diagram and prior probabilities to the exogenous variables in the diagram. A formal explication of the assumptions embedded in a causal diagram is given in <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref>. Succinctly, if D is the diagram associated with the causal model then: Every missing arrow, say between X and Y , represents the assumption that X has no effect on Y once we intervene and hold the parents of Y fixed. <p> The "if" part follows from the validity of the back-door test <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref>. The "only if" part requires the construction of a specific model in which Eq. (1) is violated, whenever X and Y have a common ancestor in D.

Reference-contexts: X and Y are said to be unconfounded by the presence of T if every member of Z of T satisfies either (U 1 ) or (U 2 ) of Definition 2. J. Robins <ref> [Robins and Pearl, 1997] </ref> has devised an alternative modification of Definition 2 which avoids the problems created by barren proxies without requiring one to judge whether a variable has an effect on Y . <p> Theorem 2 also establishes a formal connection between confounding and "collapsibility" | a criterion under which a measure of association remains invariant to the omission of certain variables. 6 It is also an immediate corollary of Theorem 7 (a) in <ref> [Robins and Pearl, 1997] </ref>. 9 Definition 6 (Collapsibility) Let g [P (y; x)] be any functional that measures the association between Y and X in the joint distribution P (x; y).

Reference-contexts: Of these, only a handful pursue the study of confounding or effect estimates, most prefer to analyze the more managable phenomenon of collapsibility as a stand-alone target. Some go as far as naming collapsibility "nonconfound-edness" <ref> [Steyer et al., 1996] </ref>). 10 ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper began as a commentary on Sander Greenland's "Causation, Confounding and Collapsibility" (1997, submitted). Subsequent discussions with James Robin and Sander Greenland were extremely valuable. Other helpful discussants were Guido Imbens, Michelle Pearl, and Rolf Steyer.
