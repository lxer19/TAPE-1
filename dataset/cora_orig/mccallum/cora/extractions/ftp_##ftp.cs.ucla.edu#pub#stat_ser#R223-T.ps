Reference-contexts: In words, do (X i = x i ) is the only action which keeps the value of X i invariant to any other action that can be implemented at the same time. 6 The standard example in the philosophical literature <ref> [Cartwright, 1989] </ref> involves the potential positive influence of birth-control pills on thrombosis, which might be masked by its negative effect on pregnancy (another cause of thrombosis).

Definition 4, which does not assume any parametric representation of the functions ff i g, extends the notion of identifiability to quantities Q that do not require the precision of parametric models.

Reference-contexts: The majority of the philosophers who have examined the semantics of counterfactual sentences have resorted to some version of Lewis' "closest world" approach: "C if it were A" is true, if C is true in worlds that are "closest" to the real world yet consistent with the counterfactual antecedent A <ref> [Lewis, 1973] </ref>. While the closest world approach leaves the precise specification of the closeness measure almost unconstrained, causal knowledge imposes very specific preferences as to which worlds should be considered closest to any given world. <p> In the domino example, finding tile i tipped and i + 1 erect requires the alteration of two basic mechanisms (i.e., two unexplained actions or "miracles" <ref> [Lewis, 1973] </ref>) compared with one altered mechanism for the world in which all j tiles, j &gt; i, are tipped.

Reference-contexts: The variables P A i (connoting "parents") are considered the direct causes of X i and they define a directed graph G which may, in general, be cyclic. However, unlike the standard definition of "parents" in Bayesian networks <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>, P A i is selected from V by considering outcomes of manipulative experiments (according to Lemma 1 below), not by conditional independence considerations. <p> (9) 8 This requirement ensures that the disturbances U are sufficiently rich to simulate a "natural experiment", that is, an experiment in which conditions change by natural phenomena rather than a human experimenter. 12 These two conditions, also called Markovian, are the basis of the independencies embodied in Bayesian networks <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>, and they enable us to compute causal effects directly from the conditional probabilities P (x i jpa i ), without specifying either the functional form of the functions f i or the distributions P (u i ) of the disturbances [Pearl, 1993a, Spirtes et al., 1993].

Reference-contexts: The graphical definition of admissible covariates replaces statistical folklore with formal procedures, and should enable analysts to systematically select an optimal set of observations, namely, a set Z that minimizes measurement cost or sampling variability. In general, it can be shown <ref> [Pearl, 1995] </ref> that: 1. The effect of interventions can often be identified (from nonexperimental data) without resorting to parametric models. 2. The conditions under which such nonparametric identification is possible can be de termined by simple graphical criteria. 3.
