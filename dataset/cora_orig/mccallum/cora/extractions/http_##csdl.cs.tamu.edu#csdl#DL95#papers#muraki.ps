Abstract: In this paper, we propose a document-preparation environment integrated with text-retrieval in the frame work of seamless digital network library. We often write documents on a word processor while referring to other text-files on personal files , group files and much open information resources like libraries and information serviced on digital network as well as books, papers and printed matters. Much of information has been already on disks and networks so that tedious looking-up work of books and paper dictionary is largely reduced with mouse clicks or key strokes for retrieving digital information resources . But there are still difficulties in referring along with writing documents on computer: (1)The acts such as key operations, mouse operations for file retrieval and(/or) book consultation for detecting relevant references interrupt users' concentration on how to express what they have in their heads, (2)No practical way to find location of information is available although users know surely there exists a vast volume of indispensable information for explicating their ideas somewhere, (3)Unconsciousness of existence of useful information can not invoke users' request of information retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose an integrated system to realize the automatic and low-cost index acquisition and documentation support environment by utilizing rich indexes acquired during writing documents. This environment encourages users' building ideas by low-cost presentation of document components collected from personal, group and open information resources. A sophisticated idea building environment has been realized based on the concept of episodic indexes and citation indexes for consulting easily personal and group document bases. It is also supported by functional retrieving mechanism of much larger volume of text data base. These establishes a new environment integrated with episode indexing which enables the total utilization of both known in personal and group files, and unknown and new information in open data base.

Recently, there has been research for computer supported creation [4, 8, 14] as well. But these systems are not for expressing ideas on texts , not for developing ideas through writing lines of texts but only for handling words or formats of texts.

Reference-contexts: Behind them are the facts <ref> [5] </ref>: 1. Key strokes in writing sentences for expressing an idea are far different from key strokes for expressing keywords for retrieval, so that keyword input for retrieving disturbs a way of thinking. 2.

Reference-contexts: For extracting retrieval keywords using this pattern, we employed an well known Japanese morphological parsing technology <ref> [6] </ref> in order to comprehend parts of phrase and partition between words. This parsing extracts easily a retrieval keyword as a pattern by receiving parts of phrasal structures.

Reference-contexts: These memories, that is to say, the episodes regarding the text provide easier and quicker retrieval of it since they are clearer in our memories than the detailed description of the text <ref> [9] </ref>. To minimize the extra cost for indexing the episodes, it is necessary to extract the episodes out of the history of text preparation and reference and to have the text hold a large amount of index of them. This non-content indexing co-exists with content indexing.

Reference-contexts: Japanese fundamental sentence is composed of a predicate and its phrases with function word, each of which is called a case element. We utilize the logical function of case elements in automatic related fact retrieval, instead of words and clauses <ref> [10] </ref>. Real-time and high-efficiency parsing is beyond the latest NLP technology. But as a Japanese case element as a rule appears on the surface before a case marker, a pattern of noun + a case marker !D predicate (verb/adjective) is correctly extracted form the input sentences to the degree needed.
