Title: Selective Attention for Handwritten Digit Recognition

Abstract: Completely parallel object recognition is NP-complete. Achieving a recognizer with feasible complexity requires a compromise between parallel and sequential processing where a system selectively focuses on parts of a given image, one after another. Successive fixations are generated to sample the image and these samples are processed and abstracted to generate a temporal context in which results are integrated over time. A computational model based on a partially recurrent feedforward network is proposed and made credible by testing on the real-world problem of recognition of hand written digits with encouraging results.

Reference-contexts: the main advantage of selective attention which is that the complexity of the system is heavily reduced at the expense of slower recognition, both in overt form of attention through foveation and in its covert form, for binding features | For this latter type of attention not discussed here, see <ref> (Ahmad, 1992) </ref>. Also note that low-level feature extraction operations like carried out in the pre-attentive level are local convolutions and are appropriate for parallel processing, e.g., on a SIMD machine. Higher--level operations require larger connectivity and are better carried out sequentially. Nature also seems to have taken this direction.

Reference-contexts: H h (t) = f X V hg F g (t) + a b ! O c (t) = h X R ck P k (t 1); c = 1 : : : 10 exp [O c (t)] k exp [O k (t)] where P denotes the "softmax"ed output probabilities <ref> (Bridle, 1990) </ref> and P (t 1) are the values in the preceding fixation (initially 0). We use the cross-entropy as the goodness measure: C = t t c D c is the required output for class c. Learning is gradient-ascent on this goodness measure.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION For all-parallel bottom-up recognition, allocating one separate unit for each possible feature combination, i.e., conjunctive encoding, implies combinatorial explosion. It has been shown that completely parallel, bottom-up visual object recognition is NP-complete <ref> (Tsotsos, 1990) </ref>. By exchanging space with time, systems with much less complexity may be designed.

Reference-contexts: The above-mentioned approach is like real-time recurrent learning <ref> (Williams and Zipser, 1989) </ref> where the partial derivatives in the previous time step is 0, thus ignoring this temporal dependence. 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have experimented with various parameter settings and finally chose the architecture given above: When input is 16 fi 16 and there are 10 classes, the fovea
