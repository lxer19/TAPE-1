Title: Formalising Abilities and Opportunities of Agents

Abstract: We present a formal system to reason about and specify the behavior of multiple intelligent artificial agents. Essentially, each agent can perform certain actions, and it may possess a variety of information in order to reason about its and other agent's actions. Thus, our KARO-framework tries to deal formally with the notion of Knowledge, possessed by the agents, and their possible execution of actions. In particular, each agent may reason about its |or, alternatively, other's| Abilities to perform certain actions, the possible Results of such an execution and the availability of the Opportunities to take a particular action. Formally, we combine dynamic and epistemic logic into one modal system, and add the notion of ability to it. We demonstrate that there are several options to define the ability to perform a sequentially composed action, and we outline several properties under two alternative choices. Also, the agents' views on the correctness and feasibility of their plans are highlighted. Finally, the complications in the completeness proof for both systems indicate that the presence of abilities in the logic makes the use of infinite proof rules useful, if not inevitable.

Reference-contexts: Although not very common, infinitary proof rules have been used in a number of proof systems: Hilbert used an infinitary proof rule in axiomatising number theory [16], Schutte uses infinitary proof rules in a number of systems [43], and both Kroger [26] and Goldblatt <ref> [10, 11] </ref> use infinitary proof rules in logics of action. In finitary proof systems proofs can be carried out completely within the formal system. <p> Since finitary proof rules can be applied as soon as all of their finitely many premises have been deduced, there is no need to step outside of the formal system. In order to apply an infinitary 3 We decided to follow the terminology of Goldblatt <ref> [10, 11] </ref> and refer to these rules as being infinitary. <p> However, there are also advantages associated with the use of infinitary proof rules. One such advantage is that for some systems strong completeness can be achieved using infinitary proof rules, whereas this is not possible using finitary proof rules (cf. <ref> [10, 43] </ref>). The notion of strong completeness implies that fewer sets of formulas are consistent, and in particular that sets of formulas that are seen to be inconsistent can also be proved to be so. <p> To make this idea of `building formulas around actions' explicit, we introduce the concept of admissible forms. The notion of admissible forms as given in Definition 6.1 is an extension of that used by Goldblatt in his language of program schemata <ref> [10] </ref>. In his investigation of infinitary proof rules, Kroger found that, in order to prove completeness, he needed rules in which the context of the while-loop and of the set f (confirm '; ff) k ; confirm :' j k 2 INg is taken into account [26]. <p> Rule R1, the Omega Iteration rule, is adopted from the axiomatisations given by Goldblatt <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. Both I and rule R2, which is the Omega Iteration rule for Ability, were already discussed above. Rule R3 is the rule of Modus Ponens, well known from, and used in, both classical and modal logics. <p> The definition of canonical models as we give it is, as far as actions and dynamic constructs are concerned, based on the construction given by Goldblatt <ref> [10] </ref>. The proof of the truth-theorem is inspired by the one given by Spruit [47] to show completeness of the Segerberg axiomatisation for propositional dynamic logic. <p> ' do ff od)] ) 2 iff f ( l (i; '; ff)) j l 2 INg 8.

Reference-contexts: However, when using just finitary rules to describe while-loops (like for instance the well-known Hoare rule <ref> [18] </ref>), the set will be consistent. For when restricting oneself to finitary rules, consistency of an infinite set of formulas corresponds to consistency of each of its finite subsets. And in every axiomatisation that is to be sound, all finite subsets of should be consistent, and therefore itself is consistent.

Reference-contexts: Proposition A.22 The ordering &lt; is well-founded. Proof: The proof of this proposition is quite elaborate; it can be found in <ref> [19] </ref> where it takes over three pages.
