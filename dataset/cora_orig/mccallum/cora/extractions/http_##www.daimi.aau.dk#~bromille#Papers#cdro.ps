Reference-contexts: Introduction The study of separation of complexity classes with respect to random oracles was initiated by Bennett and Gill <ref> [1] </ref> and continued by many researchers. Computation relative to an oracle A, where A f0; 1g fl is a computation which is allowed to ask queries of the form y 2 A? and get answers.

Reference-contexts: This is optimal, since standard techniques provide a simulation of NC A k by polynomial size, depth O (log k n= log log n), unbounded fan-in A-circuits for any oracle A <ref> [2] </ref>. From the fact that NC A k+* 6 AC A k for random A with probability 1, we get the following corollary. Corollary 8 For rational k 0 and * &gt; 0, NC A k 6= NC A k 6= k+* for random A with probability 1.

Reference-contexts: Since every function has unrelativized depth at most n + o (n), the result is optimal, up to a multiplicative constant of 2 + *.

Reference-contexts: Recall the following definitions by Wilson <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>.
