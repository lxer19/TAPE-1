Abstract: This study presents and compares performance measurements of Digital's DSP5350 disk drive and Seagate's Elite 3 disk drive, model ST43400N. Both drives are designed to connect to hosts that comply with the Small Computer System Interface-2 (SCSI-2). Measurements of both drives, taken from the same testbed system, are used to characterize the drives' performance behaviors. Specific issues investigated include IO operation service times, throughput capacity, throughput-response time trade-off, and the effects of cache hit ratio on performance. Also, each drive's performance is measured on a set of trace workloads and the results compared.

Reference-contexts: Elite 3 drives also employ a read-ahead algorithm which transfers, to the cache, blocks contiguous to requested read blocks. 3 Testbed and Methodology Performance measurements were taken from a testbed system consisting of a MicroVAX 3400, running the VMS 5.5-2 operating system. A CQD-440/M adapter <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, manufactured by CMD Technology, connected the host to the drive being measured. A DEC RF72 disk drive served as the primary disk storage system; that is, the RF72 was used to support all operating system functions. <p> Other salient features of the CQD-440, listed in <ref> [6] </ref>, include the following. The CQD-440 adapter supports synchronous device transmission (10 MBps) and, optionally, asynchronous transmission (7 MBps).

Reference-contexts: The DEC Q-bus has nominal data capacity of 3 MBps, depending on IO transfer size. In many experiments which measure storage subsystem capacity, the Q-bus is the performance bottleneck. The disk storage monitoring package QIOTOOLS, described in <ref> [8] </ref>, was used to generate synthetic IO workloads, submit IO requests (including trace workloads), and to measure storage subsystem performance. In all experiments, the disconnect/reconnect feature was enabled and synchronous transmission mode was used. Measurements were collected and analyzed for single test drive configurations only.
