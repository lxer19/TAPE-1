Title: Interactive Evolution in the framework of Simulated Natural Evolution  
Author: Jeanine Graf and Wolfgang Banzhaf 
Keyword: Growth, Paleontology, Evolutionary Algorithms, Simulation of Natural Evolution, Computer Graphics.  
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how interactive evolution can be applied to the evolution of simulated natural evolution. Evolutionary algorithms of selection and variation by recombination and/or mutation can be used to simulate biological evolution in a computer. Interactive evolution can be used to direct the development of graphic models that are simulations of their counterparts in nature. Interactive evolution thus can be used to evolve models of animals and plants. We show that interactivity of artificial evolution can serve as a useful tool for achieving progress in the ontogenesis of simulated models and help paleontologist to solve problems in identifying likely missing links.

Reference-contexts: For real-valued problems, the variation usually takes the form of zero mean Gaussian perturbations, with the variances of the perturbations either being set as a function of the parent's error score (Fogel 1995), or as a self-adaptive value <ref> (Fogel et al. 1992) </ref>. Recombination is not used in typical implementations of EP. Selection is accomplished probabilistically using a competition procedure that allows less-fit solutions some probability of being included in the subsequent generation, yet also guarantees that the best solution found to that point will be retained.

Reference-contexts: The best-known representatives of this class of algorithms are evolution strategies (ESs), developed in Germany by I. Rechenberg (21) and H.-P. Schwefel (23), evolutionary programming (EP), developed in the U.S. by L.J. Fogel <ref> (Fogel, et al. 1966) </ref>, and genetic algorithms (GAs), developed in the U.S. by J.H. Holland (17). Evolution strategies (ES) were first applied in the field of experimental optimization and used discrete mutations (Rechenberg 1994). When computers became available, algorithms were devised that operated on continuous-valued variables. <p> Evolutionary programming (EP) was originally proposed as a method to optimize finite state machines for time series prediction <ref> (Fogel et al. 1966) </ref>, this as a prerequisite for evolving intelligent behavior. More recently, EP has been used to address real-valued optimization problems. A population of candidate solutions to the task at hand is subjected to random variation and selection over successive iterations.

Reference-contexts: Much of evolutionary biology is the working out of an adaptative program. Evolutionary biologists assume that each aspect of an organism's morphology, physiology and behavior has been modeled by natural selection as a solution to a problem posed by the environment <ref> (R. Lewontin 1978) </ref>. From these facts and from the wealth of accumulated evidence on the comparative embryology and morphology of the living representatives of fossil groups it is possible to build a picture of the rise of major animal groups.

Reference-contexts: 1 Motivation World view at the present time is influenced by the knowledge that the universe, the earth and all living things have evolved through a long history of continual, gradual change shaped by more or less directional natural processes consistent with the laws of physics <ref> (E. Mayr 1978) </ref>. Paleontologists would like to discover morphologic intermediates in the fossil record. There are still gaps between each of the groups of animals and plants, which motivated us to consider the problem of finding out some morphologic intermediates with the help of simulated evolution.

Parameters for self-adaption of the step sizes are also provided, although the methods for performing self-adapation <ref> (Schwefel 1995) </ref> precede those of Fogel et al. (1992), and initial comparisons favor the methods of Schwefel (1981).

Reference-contexts: It is only during the last fifth of the history of life on the earth that multicellular organisms have existed. They seem to have taken shape from unicellular organisms on numerous occasions <ref> (J. Valentine, 1978) </ref> The animals and plants are all multicellular, made up of millions or billions of individual cells. Even the simplest multicellular organisms include diverse categories and types of cells. At least two million multi-cellular species exist today, and many others have come and gone over the ages.
