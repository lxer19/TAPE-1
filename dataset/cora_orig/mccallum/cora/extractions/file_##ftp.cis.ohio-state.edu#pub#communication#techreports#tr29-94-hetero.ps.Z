Reference-contexts: In this section we briefly discuss these requirements. 3.1 Processing Speed The performance of the currently available parallel computers and of those expected to be available in the next few years has been reported in <ref> [1, 2, 15, 27] </ref>. The processing speeds of the nodes that can constitute a heterogeneous system is growing at a fast pace.

Reference-contexts: The passive star-coupled interconnection can support a variety of communication protocols for master-slave communication, like ALOHA <ref> [3] </ref> or time-division multiplexed access (TDMA) to the shared channel. We analyze these protocols and topologies from the standpoint of medium access control as well as contention resolution. <p> Since the slaves' receivers are not tuned to the master's channel, a slave can know about a successful transmission to the master only on receiving an acknowledgment from the master. Hence, the CSMA-CD protocol will deliver a performance that is hardly better than the 15 comparatively simpler ALOHA protocol <ref> [3] </ref> which does not have to continuously sense the channel. The ALOHA protocol transmits the entire data and relies on the feedback properties of the network to detect collisions. So, due to its simplicity, using the ALOHA protocol for communication with the master during result transmission is advisable.

Reference-contexts: Hence, there is a need for high bandwidth and low latency communication networks to build heterogeneous platforms. Recently, high speed communication networks like HIPPI [30], FDDI [25], and Nectar <ref> [4, 22] </ref> are being used to interconnect high speed parallel computers. These networks use optic fiber as the communication medium to transmit data between the nodes.

The individual signal streams, along different wavelengths, from the source nodes are combined in a passive star coupler. The combined signal is sent on each outgoing fiber. <p> At the destination node optical filters can select the desired signal stream and reject the remaining streams. The protocols have low complexity, which is especially important since there is still a great mismatch between the speeds of the optical network interfaces and the bandwidth of the fiber <ref> [5] </ref>. The protocols are also scalable since large and energy efficient passive star couplers with low latency can be designed [9]. We present brief descriptions of two WDM access mechanisms.

In this paper, we develop guidelines for building heterogeneous parallel systems with passive star-coupled interconnections. <p> As an alternative to the slaves directly sending the results of their subtasks to the master, which is known as direct communication, we propose two new approaches using optical interconnections: a treelike hierarchical interconnection topology and a communication scheme that employs tunable optic filters <ref> [7] </ref> at the communicating nodes. The passive star-coupled interconnection can support a variety of communication protocols for master-slave communication, like ALOHA [3] or time-division multiplexed access (TDMA) to the shared channel.

In this section, we show how optic-fiber cables and an entirely new set of communication protocols and topologies can be used to support high bandwidth and low latency communication requirements of heterogeneous parallel systems. <p> Let us, now, discuss each of these issues in some detail. 4.2 Medium Access Protocol Recent technological advancements have made it easier to achieve higher transmission bit-rates using wavelength-division multiplexing instead of time-division multiplexing <ref> [7] </ref>. Also, the bandwidth of the fiber is most easily accessed in the wavelength domain than in the time domain [7]. Hence, em wavelength division multiplexed access (WDMA) is the most suitable medium access protocol for optical interconnection architectures. <p> each of these issues in some detail. 4.2 Medium Access Protocol Recent technological advancements have made it easier to achieve higher transmission bit-rates using wavelength-division multiplexing instead of time-division multiplexing <ref> [7] </ref>.

Acoustooptic tunable filters can be tuned to receive signals on the desired channel by changing the acoustic drive frequency <ref> [7] </ref>. They have a broad tuning range and the drive power to tune such filters is quite low, 100-200 milliwatt. Also, acoustooptic filters can select more than one wavelength simultaneously. This enables a node to receive data along multiple channels concurrently.

Reference-contexts: Previous efforts towards parallelizing the execution of such tasks have involved running all the subtasks on a set of identical processing units. This has led to a poor exploitation of the inherent parallelism in the subtasks. Heterogeneous processing <ref> [8, 14, 16, 20, 21] </ref> aims to exploit the coarse-grain heterogeneity of an application task by executing it on a suite of heterogeneous parallel computers. In such systems, parallel computers with diverse architectures (SIMD/MIMD/vector, etc.) are connected through a network. <p> Previous studies in heterogeneous computing have concentrated mainly on the software aspects: determining the nature of parallelism inherent in the subtasks, finding a suitable match between a subtask and a parallel computer, and the penalties of non-suitable subtask assignments <ref> [8, 14, 21, 31] </ref>. However, very little research has been done to study the architectural and communication aspects of such systems. Since heterogeneous systems emphasize coarse-grain meta-parallelism, they involve high volume of communication that is bursty in nature. <p> Without loss of generality, let us assume that there are always a sufficient number of computers available and each subtask can be allocated to the computer which best exploits the nature of parallelism in that subtask. This assumption is based on the Optimal Selection Theory <ref> [8, 21, 31] </ref>. It can also be assumed that only one task is being executed by the system at any given time. This avoids external interference from any other task.

Also, advances in the areas of fast tunable transmitters exceed those in fast tunable receivers, and the tuning times for receivers are relatively long as compared to the packet transmission times and their tuning range is small <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus a tunable receiver protocol will have significant overheads that may offset the advantages due to the absence of contention. Tunable receivers are suitable for broadcasting or multicasting data, i.e., if the input data to several slaves is the same.

They 3 can be divided into a number of subtasks having different kinds of parallelism embedded in them (SIMD/MIMD/vector). These subtasks also have certain control and data dependencies amongst them. <p> As the subtasks exhibit different kinds of parallelism, executing all of them on a homogeneous parallel computer or on a network of homogeneous parallel computers will not yield optimum performance.

Reference-contexts: This compares favorably with the n 1 fi n 2 messages required for point-to-point communication between these two sets of slaves. Such master-slave model, with centralized information about all computers, also helps in achieving load balancing in a heterogeneous system <ref> [17] </ref>. It is to be noted that the number of subtasks spawned concurrently in a phase is known as the degree of parallelism of that phase. The task graph shown in Fig. 2 is quite suitable for multiple-phase master-slave execution. Initially, the master spawns T 1 on a slave.

Reference-contexts: In order to maximize the achievable bandwidth in the network, such collisions have to be minimized. If a carrier sense strategy, like CSMA-CD <ref> [18] </ref>, is employed the slaves will send data by tuning to the master's channel, and at the same time sense the channel for collisions by listening to the channel. A slave will stop transmitting as soon as it detects a collision.

Reference-contexts: For example, the basic disk storage node and the data vault of CM-5 provide peak transfer rates of 17 megabytes/second and 25 megabytes/second, respectively. The Intel Paragon's disk provides a peak transfer rate of 100 megabytes/second <ref> [19] </ref>. Disk transfer rates can be further increased through architectural innovations such as connecting an array of disks to the high speed network mentioned above and employing interleaved disk access. However, over the years, disk access time has not decreased at the same rate as the transfer rate has increased.

Reference-contexts: Hence, there is a need for high bandwidth and low latency communication networks to build heterogeneous platforms. Recently, high speed communication networks like HIPPI [30], FDDI <ref> [25] </ref>, and Nectar [4, 22] are being used to interconnect high speed parallel computers. These networks use optic fiber as the communication medium to transmit data between the nodes.

Reference-contexts: Improvements in communication characteristics of the system should be manifested as a decrease in the overall task completion time. In order to observe the impact of the proposed strategies, their performance was studied through simulation experiments. A process-oriented discrete-event simulator using CSIM <ref> [26] </ref> was used. 5.1 Simulation Environment The salient features of the simulation environment are described below: System characteristics: We simulated the performance of a heterogeneous system consisting 20 of a set of parallel computers (nodes).

Reference-contexts: In this section we briefly discuss these requirements. 3.1 Processing Speed The performance of the currently available parallel computers and of those expected to be available in the next few years has been reported in <ref> [1, 2, 15, 27] </ref>. The processing speeds of the nodes that can constitute a heterogeneous system is growing at a fast pace. A 1024 node CM-5, with a peak performance of 131 gigaflops is an example of the processing power currently available, and an indicator of things to come. <p> The high performance parallel interface (HIPPI) physical layer standard is being suggested as the backbone for connecting high performance computers [30]. HIPPI defines full duplex parallel interfaces that can run at speeds up to 200 megabytes/second <ref> [27, 30] </ref>. It has an Ethernet connection in its data path which becomes a bottleneck. The high overhead associated with Ethernet communication also limits the data transmission rate that can be sustained.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that on receiving the data, the slave invokes the routine corresponding to the subtask from its library. This is similar to a remote procedure call <ref> [28] </ref>. The actual implementation of the subtask at a slave is optimized to exploit the architectural features of the slave, and to provide the best possible performance for the subtask at that computer. Once again, Fig. 4 represents the execution of a phase consisting of n subtasks. <p> Local area networks are currently used to connect computing nodes a few kilometers apart. The twisted pair and coaxial cable communication media currently used by these networks have a limited bandwidth over distances of a few kilometers <ref> [28] </ref>. They cannot sustain the traffic produced by a heterogeneous system, which can be of the order of several gigabits per second, over the distances separating the constituent nodes. A single coaxial cable cannot carry several data channels of 1-gigabit bandwidth, even over short distances.

Reference-contexts: The recent developments in fiber-optics networks promise data transfer rate of the order of 1 Gbits/sec. One such development is passive star-coupled interconnection using wavelength division multiplexing [5, 7, 10]. This technology is currently being explored to provide high performance interconnection for parallel systems <ref> [6, 29] </ref>. However, it has not been studied in the context of heterogeneous parallel systems. In this paper, we develop guidelines for building heterogeneous parallel systems with passive star-coupled interconnections.

The high overhead associated with Ethernet communication also limits the data transmission rate that can be sustained. Establishing and terminating a HIPPI connection also takes a long time due to round-trip delays across the Ethernet <ref> [30] </ref>. On the basis of the preceding discussion, it is obvious that the communication media and protocols currently in use are not suitable for building future heterogeneous systems. There is a definite need for multiple high bandwidth, low latency communication channels.

Reference-contexts: Previous studies in heterogeneous computing have concentrated mainly on the software aspects: determining the nature of parallelism inherent in the subtasks, finding a suitable match between a subtask and a parallel computer, and the penalties of non-suitable subtask assignments <ref> [8, 14, 21, 31] </ref>. However, very little research has been done to study the architectural and communication aspects of such systems. Since heterogeneous systems emphasize coarse-grain meta-parallelism, they involve high volume of communication that is bursty in nature. <p> Without loss of generality, let us assume that there are always a sufficient number of computers available and each subtask can be allocated to the computer which best exploits the nature of parallelism in that subtask. This assumption is based on the Optimal Selection Theory <ref> [8, 21, 31] </ref>. It can also be assumed that only one task is being executed by the system at any given time. This avoids external interference from any other task.
