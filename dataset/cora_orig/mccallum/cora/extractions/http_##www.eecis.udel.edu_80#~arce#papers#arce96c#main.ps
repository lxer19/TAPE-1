Abstract: Oversampled Sigma-Delta modulation (SDM) is becoming a standard method for implementing high-resolution A/D and D/A converters in silicon. Digital decimation filters play a fundamental role in Oversampled Sigma-Delta A/D decoders. In this paper, we first show that Weighted Median Filters (WMF) can be used for SDM decimation filters and that these filters are readily implemented in the SDM binary domain. A very promising characteristic SDM converters equipped with weighted median decimating filters is that sharp discontinuities (edges) can be preserved and acquired. Thus, the bandlimited constraint imposed on the input signals could be relaxed making SDM more attractive to A/D conversion of signals containing sharp transitions. Secondly, we show that weighted median filtering of a demodulated sequence (at the Nyquist rate) can be implemented concurrently in the A/D decoder. Thus, by a simple modification of the binary time-series outputted by the A/D modulator, the sequence obtained after the SDM demodulator is shown to be equivalent to weighted median filtering the multilevel sequence at the Nyquist rate. The proposed signal processing algorithms, in essence, combine A/D sigma-delta converters and weighted median filters into a single programmable system. A joint WMF and SDM A/D tunnable converter, can be used in speech and audio applications in (possibly) noisy environments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Oversampled Sigma-Delta modulation (SDM) is becoming a standard method for implementing high-resolution A/D and D/A converters in silicon <ref> [1] </ref>. Among the reasons of the increasing popularity of SDM are: (a) high resolution quantization is attained with simple circuits, (b) these are robust to circuit imperfections, (c) allows for speed vs. resolution tradeoffs, and (d) lower cost of implementations. <p> The quantization error is now spread over a larger region but the signal power is 1 In-depth reviews of SDM converters can be found in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. 1 still concentrated within its bandwidth. The height of the quantization error spectra is E R = 2 e R . <p> For instance, 64fi oversampling could yield a converter with 9 bits of effective resolution. Higher performance can 3 be attained if more complicated encoders, such as multi-stage or multi-loop SDM encoders are used <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. The SDM encoder outputs an oversampled binary sequence carrying the information sequence plus a noise term with well defined spectral characteristics. For A/D conversion, the SDM encoder must be followed by a decoder whose function is that of extracting and downsampling the information signal. <p> A simple implementation of the LPF is shown in Fig. 3 where Comb filters are running average smoothers with uniform tap weights h (n) = 1=R, for n = 0; 1; ; R 1. The performance of SDM converters can be improved if the filter coefficients are optimized <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. From the above, it is clear that digital decimation filters play a fundamental role in oversampled Sigma-Delta A/D decoders.

Reference-contexts: In general, linear FIR digital filters are used in practice simply because these are easily implemented and can be designed to give good performance in terms of intermodulation and harmonic distortion <ref> [5] </ref>. Silicon implementations of SDM converters using linear FIR filters are readily available today. Data Translation, for example, offers a 64fi oversampling SDM encoder board with a "brick-wall" filter decoder attaining an effective 15:1 bits of effective resolution.

Reference-contexts: The study of WM filters relies on a theoretical tool called threshold decomposition which states that in order to analyze and design WM filters for arbitrary multilevel signals, it is often sufficient to characterize the effects of WM filters on binary signals <ref> [6] </ref>. In fact, threshold decomposition is often used to implement the WM filter operation with simple threshold logic elements and thus avoiding more computationally expensive sorting networks. <p> to the ordered elements Q + (2) () Q + Using the ordered sums, the output in (2) is found as y (n) + 1 = R " R X Q + R X Q + # Each sum has ordered binary elements fitting the framework of threshold decompo sition <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the above the weights are restricted to be non-negative integers. A more general definition of the WM filter where the coefficients are allowed to take on non-negative real values is possible and is easily implemented <ref> [8] </ref>. The derivation of the implementation of weighted median filters in the sigma-modulation encoding domain is described next. For the purpose of simplicity we assume that the SDM decoder has the structure shown in Fig. 3. More elaborated decoders can also be used but the notation becomes less tractable. <p> In the above we have defined the structure of MW filter based SDM decoders. We now turn to the design of the WM filter coefficients to attain good high frequency attenuation. There are several design methods available for WM filters <ref> [8, ?] </ref>. Here we describe how to adapt one design method to the SDM framework. Other methods could be applied but such treatment is beyond the scope of this paper. <p> In our experiments we used a set of high-resolution signals quantized at 32 bits for x a (nT ) and for the desired signal d (n). The WM filter coefficients are all initialized to unity and the fast adaptive filter algorithm in <ref> [8] </ref> is used.
