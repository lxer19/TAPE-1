Reference-contexts: Object-based coding methods, on the other hand, do not have this problem. In object-based coding, an image sequence is segmented into objects using characteristics such as motion, intensity, shape, etc. [18]. A general block diagram for an object-based coder is presented in figure 1-1. Wang and Adelson <ref> [1, 24, 25] </ref> have proposed the layered representation for efficient image sequence decomposition. In the layered representation, an image sequence is decomposed into a set of overlapping objects, which are referred to as layers, on the basis of their motion (see chapter 2 for details). <p> Object-based methods have been suggested for more accurate motion estimation [18]. In this section, we will provide a brief description of the layered representation, put forth by Wang and Adelson. This section is only meant to highlight the main ideas behind the representation. For details, refer to <ref> [1, 24, 25, 26] </ref>. The figures included in this section are taken from those papers. Layered representation The layered representation decomposes an image sequence into a set of overlapping objects, which are referred to as layers, based on their motion.

Reference-contexts: Since this algorithm maps variable length input symbols to fixed length codewords, it can be considered as a variable-to-fixed length code. An implementation of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm as a variable-to-variable length code can be found in <ref> [4, 27] </ref>. Due to the speed and efficiency of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, it has become a standard for compressing text and facsimile. In chapter 4, we will use it for alpha map encoding. 2.2 Transform coding So far we have only considered lossless compression of images.

Reference-contexts: Further improvement in compression can be obtained by using Huffman coding in conjunction with run length coding. 2.1.3 Lempel-Ziv Algorithm The Lempel-Ziv algorithm is a universal data compression scheme <ref> [6] </ref>. It is asymptotically optimal and has a simple implementation. Consider a binary sequence that needs to be encoded. The algorithm sequentially parses the sequence into strings that have not been seen before.

Reference-contexts: Using our binary alpha map encoding algorithm, we have been able to obtain a bit rate of about 2 bits/contour point for complex 8-connected contours. This bit rate includes the bits that represent the error information required for boundary filling. Eden et al. <ref> [7] </ref> have shown compression results of 1.2 bits/contour point for simple 4-connected contours (without boundary filling). Detailed results will be presented in the chapter on compression results. 25 4.3 Lossy contour encoding The contour encoding method described in the previous section performs lossless compression of alpha maps.

Reference-contexts: Problem: Develop a transform with arbitrary support. Before discussing the solution, we will present some previous work on edge block coding. 5.3.2 Previous work Earlier work on object coding was done by Eden et al., Kocher and Leonardi, Gilge et al., and Barnard et al.. Eden et al. <ref> [8] </ref> have described polynomial representations for object coding, but they only consider rectangular objects.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that our object coding algorithms are not specific to the layered representation. They can be used in any of the numerous methods that produce objects, for example model-based image coding and coding of still-images using segmentation based on intensity or texture <ref> [10] </ref>. Also, it is widely believed that the next generation of image coders will utilize mid-level vision techniques that include segmentation and object representation. <p> Leonardi [15] use polynomials of up to second order to represent arbitrarily shaped objects. 5 The support of a function is defined to be the set on which the function assumes non zero values. 39 (a) (b) Gilge et al. have presented region oriented generalized orthogonal transforms for object coding <ref> [5, 9, 10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An illustration of this algorithm is given in figure 4-1. Figure 4-2 shows the boundary contour of the tree layer given in figure 1-3. 4.2 Lossless contour encoding Our contour encoding algorithm uses chain coding <ref> [11] </ref> to obtain a compact description of the alpha map. In chain coding, a contour is represented by a starting point and a sequence of directionals that gives the direction of travel as the contour is traced.

Reference-contexts: It is a fixed-to-variable length code, that is, it maps fixed length input symbols to variable length codewords. It reduces the average codeword length by assigning shorter codewords to highly frequent symbols and longer codewords to rarely occurring symbols. The algorithm is as follows <ref> [12] </ref>: 1. List all input symbols and consider them as leaf nodes of a binary tree. 2. Create a parent node for the two nodes with smallest probability. Assign the parent node a probability equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two children.
Reference: [13] <author> ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11. </author> <title> Mpeg test model. </title>
Reference-contexts: Since MPEG applies prediction to blocks of data, it is considered to be a block-based sequence coding method. Once the motion is estimated, it finds the prediction error and encodes it using the DCT. The details of the algorithm can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. The disadvantage of MPEG is that for many real sequences, block matching fails to give good estimates of motion. Block matching performs poorly if the block falls on object boundary or if the motion in the block is not translational (shear, rotational, and zoom).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, instead of encoding the frames separately, it is highly advantageous to compress them jointly. The spatial correlation in an image can be reduced by using techniques such as transform and waveform coding <ref> [14, 16, 19, 21] </ref>, whereas the temporal correlation can be reduced by motion compensation [14, 16]. An example of coding with motion compensation is the MPEG coder, which is the current industry standard. <p> Therefore, instead of encoding the frames separately, it is highly advantageous to compress them jointly.

Section 2.1 covers various lossless source coding techniques. Transform coding methods are described in section 2.2. <p> Next, we show that the Karhunen-Loeve Transform is the optimum transform that satisfies these properties. 2.2.1 KLT The KLT has the property that its coefficients are uncorrelated and have maximum compaction. An elegant derivation for the KLT is given in <ref> [14] </ref>. It can be proven that the basis functions of the KLT are the eigenvectors of the input covariance matrix. Let u be the vector of input random variables with an M xM covariance matrix, L u . Let T be a unitary transformation and v be the coefficients. <p> The proof that the KLT is optimal in energy compaction can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Although the KLT is optimal, it is not very practical for two reasons: * The basis functions have to computed before transformation because the basis functions depend on the input. <p> This figure demonstrates that erosion is a shrinking operation and dilation is an expansion operation. Erosion and dilation can be used to build more complicated morphological operations such as open, close, etc. <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm has two main steps: local motion estimation and motion 16 segmentation. Local motion estimation The local motion between successive frame pairs is obtained with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine optic flow algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>. The optic flow is a gradient based motion estimation technique, given by I (x v x (x; y); y v y (x; y); t 1) I (x; y; t) (2:19) where (v x (x; y); v y (x; y)) is the motion at (x; y).

Reference-contexts: The simple block model is unable to describe the multiple motions arising from an occlusion. Object-based coding methods, on the other hand, do not have this problem. In object-based coding, an image sequence is segmented into objects using characteristics such as motion, intensity, shape, etc. <ref> [18] </ref>.

Object-based methods have been suggested for more accurate motion estimation <ref> [18] </ref>. In this section, we will provide a brief description of the layered representation, put forth by Wang and Adelson. This section is only meant to highlight the main ideas behind the representation.

Reference-contexts: The performance of the DCT has been shown to be virtually indistinguishable from the KLT. For certain images, the DCT basis functions approach the KLT basis functions <ref> [20] </ref>. The complete set of the 8 x 8 DCT basis functions are shown in figure 2-2. As one can see, the basis functions are cosines of various frequencies. The DCT is similar to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in that they both map spatial domain to frequency domain.

Reference-contexts: Proof: The proof for this standard linear algebra theorem can be found in <ref> [22] </ref>. From claims 1 and 2, it is follows that by retaining M independent elements of B 0 , we obtain a basis, B R , for S R . Since B 0 has 64 elements, it has a large number of subsets with M independent elements.

Reference-contexts: The motion segmentation starts out by estimating affine models from the flow field. The affine models are initially estimated over small rectangular block regions. Since blocks corresponding to a single object will have similar affine parameters, they are merged together using a k-means clustering algorithm <ref> [23] </ref>. However, for some blocks that fall on object boundaries, the initial affine models do not represent their motion accurately. For better segmentation of these blocks, hypothesis testing is used to determine the correct model for each pixel.

Reference-contexts: An illustration of Huffman coding is given in figure 2-1. Huffman encoding and decoding simply require a table look-up. Because of the simplicity of this algorithm, Huffman codes are extremely popular for lossless source coding. An alternative to Huffman coding is arithmetic coding, which is described in <ref> [28] </ref>. An image can be viewed as a source if we consider the intensity at each pixel to be a source symbol. Huffman coding can then be used on this model of the image.
