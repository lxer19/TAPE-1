Abstract: As the Internet makes the transition from research testbed to commercial enterprise, the topic of pricing in computer networks has suddenly attracted great attention. Much of the discussion in the network design community and the popular press centers on the usage-based vs. flat pricing debate. The more academic literature has largely focused on devising optimal pricing policies; achieving optimal welfare requires charging marginal congestion costs for usage. In this paper we critique this optimality paradigm on three grounds: (1) marginal cost prices may not produce sufficient revenue to fully recover costs and so are perhaps of limited relevance, (2) congestion costs are inherently inaccessible to the network and so cannot reliably form the basis for pricing, and (3) there are other, more structural, goals besides optimality, and some of these goals are incompatible with the global uniformity required for optimal pricing schemes. For these reasons, we contend that the research agenda on pricing in computer network should shift away from the optimality paradigm and focus more on structural and architectural issues. Such issues include allowing local control of pricing policies, fostering interconnection, handling multicast appropriately, and allowing receivers to pay for transmission. To illustrate our point, we describe how these goals might be accomplished in the context of a different pricing paradigm: edge pricing. In addition, we argue that in the context of this edge pricing paradigm, usage-based pricing and flat pricing are not radically different but instead both reside along the single continuum of usage-constraining pricing policies.

Reference-contexts: While in simple theoretical models it is convenient to use the abstraction that a user's utility is a function of, say, average bandwidth and delay (as in [38]), the real world is significantly more complicated; see the discussion in <ref> [7] </ref> about the properties of best-effort traffic. Unfortunately, we have little beyond these simple theoretical models to guide us. <p> For instance, the performance of a file transfer depends on the time the last packet is delivered; for large files this transfer time depends almost exclusively on the throughput rate and not on the individual packet delays (see <ref> [7] </ref> for a more thorough discussion of this point). It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the network to infer the effect on the transfer time arising from delaying any of the individual packets, especially since the transfer time is also a function of the user's congestion control algorithm. <p> In Section 4 we discuss the multicast case where the relevant information is difficult to obtain. As discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>, edge pricing has the attractive property that all pricing is done locally. Interconnection here involves the network providers purchasing service from each other in the same manner that regular users purchase service.

Reference-contexts: However, in bundled networks such as cable TV, where the application and the network transport are sold as a single unit, there are many more opportunities to recover costs. Profits on content and revenue from advertising <ref> [10] </ref> are important aspects of pricing in bundled networks. We do not consider such bundled networks in this paper, and restrict ourselves to the analysis of pricing pure Internet access without bundled services.

Reference-contexts: Thus, fairly static tables at the entry points can provide adequate information for pricing decisions, and it would be relatively trivial to design the distributed algorithms needed to construct and maintain these tables. 16 If addresses encode geographic information (as in Deering's recent proposal <ref> [11] </ref>) or 14 Charging receivers for service is a nonlocal problem because, in approaches with explicit willingness-to-pay signaling, when both the source and receiver are serviced by the same provider the source's access point must be informed that the receiver is willing to assume responsibility for the transmission.

The interconnection arrangements between providers are somewhat ad hoc (see <ref> [17, 41] </ref>) and changing rapidly. Interconnection among these networks is crucial for maximizing social welfare. Pricing schemes should not hinder interconnection by requiring detailed agreement on pricing policies and complicated per-flow transfers (i.e., a separate transfer for each flow) of money when carrying traffic from another interconnected network.

Reference-contexts: We will call this local scheme edge pricing. A similar approach to pricing in computer networks has been suggested by Jacobson <ref> [22] </ref>. The prices charged at the edge, or access, point may depend on information obtained from other parts of the network, but the entire computation of charges is performed at the access point. In Section 4 we discuss the multicast case where the relevant information is difficult to obtain.

Reference-contexts: But it is doubtful that such marginal cost prices will recover the full facility costs of computer networks. Within the context of the congestible resource model studied in <ref> [29] </ref>, marginal costs only cover the cost of the facilities priced at marginal expansion cost (i.e., the total congestion costs are equal to the product of the total capacity times the marginal cost of capacity). <p> The most ambitious pricing proposal for best-effort traffic is the "smart-market" proposal of MacKie-Mason and Varian described in <ref> [29] </ref> (see also 6 ([27, 26]). In this scheme, each packet carries a "bid" in the packet header; packets are given service at each router if their bids exceed some threshold, and each served packet is charged this threshold price regardless of the packet's bid.

While the cost structure of networks is in flux as technologies rapidly evolve, it seems clear a large portion of the facility costs arises from the fixed (i.e., not related to capacity) costs of deploying the physical infrastructure.
