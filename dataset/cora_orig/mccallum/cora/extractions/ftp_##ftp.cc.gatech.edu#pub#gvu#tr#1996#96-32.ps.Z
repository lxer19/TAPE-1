Abstract: When sufficient computing power is available, dynamic simulation can be used as a source of motion for real-time, interactive virtual environments. In this paper, we explore techniques for reducing the computational cost of simulating groups of creatures by using less accurate simulations for individuals when they are less important to the viewer or to the action in the virtual world. The less accurate, or lower level of detail, simulations can be dynamic with fewer degrees of freedom, hybrid kinematic/dynamic, or purely kinematic. As a test of the effectiveness of this approach, we implemented an environment with dynamically simulated legged creatures. Because the creatures switch smoothly among different levels of detail for the underlying simulation, we can achieve real-time performance for a larger group of creatures than would be possible if each creature were dynamically simulated. To be useful in this test case, the method must meet two criteria: the outcome of the game must be essentially unchanged and the viewer's perception of the motion must be the same. While it is not possible to make definitive measurements of these criteria, we assess the performance gain from using different levels of detail and make a preliminary assessment of the effect that the decreased accuracy has on the outcome of the sample game.

Reference-contexts: One measure of success for a system such as this is whether the required computation can be reduced without affecting the visual quality of the motion [4]. Another measure is whether the fundamental behavior of the virtual world is changed. Brogan and Hodgins <ref> [1] </ref> explore the differences in the behavior of dynamically simulated one-legged creatures with the behavior of point masses in the context of multi-agent flocking behaviors. In our application, the outcome of the game might be an appropriate measure of the behavior of the virtual world.

Reference-contexts: Girard and Maciejewski [8] developed animation techniques for running and dancing legged creatures that used a point-mass dynamic model to control the position of the body. The legs of the creatures were animated using inverse kinematics and constraints to position the feet on the ground. Bruderlin and Calvert <ref> [2] </ref> took this approach a step further when they implemented a kinematic runner whose body followed a parabolic trajectory in the air. Incorporating data from the biomechanical literature, their system encapsulated information about how people run and gave the animator control over stylistic parameters of the running motion.

Reference-contexts: Although the techniques that researchers have used to develop lower resolution models are specific to systems for geometric levels of detail, the techniques they developed for selecting the appropriate model to render are relevant to systems that vary the level of detail of dynamic simulation. Funkhouser and Sequin <ref> [7] </ref> use a cost/benefit heuristic to determine the appropriate geometric level of detail for each object in order to achieve a fast, constant frame rate in building walkthroughs. Their heuristic primarily relies on estimating the screen size of an object to determine the level of detail for the underlying model.

Reference-contexts: A foot, upper body, and arms were added to the model kinematically and made to move in an oscillatory pattern similar to that observed in humans.

Reference-contexts: A similar hierarchy of levels of detail was also used for a bipedal creature with telescoping legs. 3.1 Dynamic model We formulated the equations of motion for the legged creatures using a commercially available package <ref> [14] </ref>. The model is shown in figure 2. The locomotion algorithm controls flight duration, body attitude, and forward and sideways velocity. Flight duration is controlled by extending the telescoping leg during stance to make up for losses in the system.

Reference-contexts: The computational cost is compounded when we want to use many interacting creatures to create interesting and compelling virtual environments. One approach to this problem is to distribute the creature simulations among many processors (see <ref> [15] </ref> for a description of one such system).
