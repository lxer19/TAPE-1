Abstract: A chordal ring G(n; c) of degree 4 is a ring of n nodes with chords connecting each vertex i to the vertex (i + c) mod n. In this paper, we investigate compact routing schemes on such networks. We show a routing scheme for any such network that requires O(log n) bits of storage at each node, and O(1) time to compute a shortest path to any destination. This improves on the results of [16] which gives a linear time algorithm for such networks and [6] where efficient routing schemes for certain fixed values of c were developed. Further, we show several bounds on interval routing schemes for such networks. We show that while every chordal ring has an optimal interval routing scheme with at most 2 p intervals on some edges. Additionally, there are chordal rings which admit no optimal one-interval routing schemes, regardless of the vertex labeling. We also consider interval routing schemes under relaxed requirements for the lengths of paths. fl An extended abstract reporting this work is to appear in the Proceedings of Fourth International Col loquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity, 1997. y Research supported partially by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and

Reference-contexts: However, as the size of the network grows, this strategy becomes expensive in terms of space. Several strategies have been proposed to derive space-efficient routing schemes <ref> [1, 10, 11, 2] </ref>. We focus on two such strategies: interval routing and boolean routing. Interval routing was proposed by Santoro and Khatib [18] as a means of achieving compact routing tables. <p> In this scheme, each node in the network is assigned a distinct label from the set f1; : : :; ng. and every link is labeled with a contiguous sub-interval from the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. The labeling has the property that for any vertex v, the sub-intervals associated with the outgoing links of v form a partition of the interval [1::n]. At run-time, a message with destination label u arriving at a node v is forwarded along the link whose label contains u. <p> Proof: We use the following interval labeling scheme for the graph G (n; c): label the vertices around the ring. We describe the labels for the edges outgoing from the vertex 14 15 with label 0; edges outgoing from other vertices are labeled similarly. `(r (0)) = <ref> [1; d c 2 e] </ref>, 2 e; n 1], `(u (0)) = [d c 2 c], `(d (0)) = [b n 2 e 1]. It is easy to see that the above scheme is a valid strict one-interval routing scheme. <p> Label the vertices around the ring. We describe the edge labeling for the vertex 0. `(0; 1) = <ref> [1; d] </ref>, `(0; 2d + 1) = [d + 1; n1 2 ], `(0; n (2d + 1)) = [ n+1 `(0; n 1) = [n d; n 1]. It is straightforward to verify that ` is 2-stretched.

Reference-contexts: Such networks are thus competitive with other fi ( p n)-diameter networks such as the mesh or the torus. Krizanc and Luccio [16] describe a boolean routing scheme for arbitrary chordal rings that requires linear time and O (log n) space at every node. In <ref> [6] </ref>, a constant-time boolean routing strategy is given for certain types of chordal rings, specifically the ones that have minimal diameter for their size. However, their results do not apply to arbitrary chordal rings. <p> This representation, that was already used in <ref> [20, 7, 6] </ref> for representing distributed loop graphs and digraphs, is used in the subsequent sections to derive several results on the routing in chordal rings.

The routing scheme from <ref> [6, 21] </ref> calculates for any given vertex u, the coordinates of u in the tile using the geometrical representation of the optimal double loop graph. <p> Thus, one only needs to determine the routing from 0 to the vertices of the graph. In this section we show that the method from <ref> [6] </ref> can be generalized to any chordal ring of degree 4. First, we need to establish a relationship between the well-designed tile of a chordal ring and the vectors of the lattice L.

Reference-contexts: We describe a simple boolean routing scheme that computes shortest paths for any chordal ring, that needs O (1) computation time, and requires O (log n) storage at every node. Our algorithm is based on the geometrical representation of chordal rings proposed in <ref> [20, 7] </ref>. This representation also enables us to derive upper bounds on interval labeling schemes for arbitrary chordal rings. An interval labeling scheme specifies, for each pair u; v of vertices in the graph, a unique path from u to v using the edges of G. <p> This representation, that was already used in <ref> [20, 7, 6] </ref> for representing distributed loop graphs and digraphs, is used in the subsequent sections to derive several results on the routing in chordal rings.

In this type of scheme, every link (u; v) has a boolean function B (u;v) associated with it; B (u;v) (x) is true if and only if the edge (u; v) is on a shortest path from u to x.
