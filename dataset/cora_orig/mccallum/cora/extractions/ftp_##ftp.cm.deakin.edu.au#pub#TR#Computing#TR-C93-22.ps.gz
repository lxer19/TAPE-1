Title: On modelling biological neurons with artificial neural networks  
Author: C. Coomber, P. Horan, R. Dew

Affiliation: School of Computing Mathematics Deakin University  
Abstract: The first few pages of any good introductory book on neurocomputing contain a cursory description of neurophysiology and how it has been abstracted to form the basis of artificial neural networks as we know them today. In particular, artificial neurons simplify considerably the behavior of their biological counterparts. It is our view that in order to gain a better understanding of how biological systems learn and remember it is necessary to have accurate models on which to base computerized experimentation. In this paper we describe an artificial neuron that is more realistic than most other models used currently. The model is based on conventional artificial neural networks (and is easily computerized) and is currently being used in our investigations into learning and memory. keywords: artificial neural networks, brain modelling, artificial neurons
