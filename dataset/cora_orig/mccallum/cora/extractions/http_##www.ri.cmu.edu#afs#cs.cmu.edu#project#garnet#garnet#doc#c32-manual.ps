Abstract: C32 is an object and constraint editor for Garnet objects. It allows Garnet objects to be viewed and edited using a spreadsheet-like interface. New values can be installed in the slots of an object directly, or constraints can be defined among the objects. This research was sponsored by NCCOSC under Contract No. N66001-94-C-6037, Arpa Order No. B326.
