Abstract: The Internet is experiencing an explosion in the number of connected users. Beyond simple mechanisms of FTP and electronic mail, distributed information services provided by WAIS, Gopher, Archie, WWW, etc. are rapidly changing the operating view of the Internet. This change is further expedited by the falling costs associated with terminal equipment that can handle continuous media such as audio and video. The support of bandwidth-intensive and storage-intensive media in a distributed environment requires rethinking both the raw data transmission infrastructure as well as information dissemination mechanisms. In this paper we describe a mechanism for location, identification, and delivery of continuous media in the form of digital motion pictures in the context of a distributed system. The metadata mechanism and supporting protocols are based on the client-server model. The mechanism can be applied to numerous application domains including multimedia-based home entertainment, catalog shopping, distance learning, and distributed-interactive classrooms. We demonstrate the practicality of our the mechanisms though a prototype application based on home entertainment.

To be successful, these applications will need to make enormous volumes of data easily accessible to their users. To make the handling of data manageable, the information will need to be distributed across different sites.

Reference-contexts: Some of these services make use of continuous media like video and audio that typically consume enormous bandwidth, and strain the resources of the network as well as local data stores <ref> [2] </ref>. However, technology has kept pace with this demand, and different communication services are being developed that will be able to support the new demands being made from the network.

Reference-contexts: These are described in the following subsections. 2.1 Metadata Management To simplify the query mechanism, and increase interactivity, most database systems employ a "metadata" mechanism <ref> [6] </ref>. Metadata are "data about data." In our context, this means that they contain concise information about the location and characteristics of the data to be retrieved (e.g., movie titles, where they are stored) [8].

Reference-contexts: To be successful, these applications will need to make enormous volumes of data easily accessible to their users. To make the handling of data manageable, the information will need to be distributed across different sites. One view, specific to the distribution of home entertainment, is shown in Fig. 1 <ref> [7] </ref>. This model consists of a local database connected via a (generic) high speed backbone 2 network to archives where multimedia information are stored. The local databases cache the information locally (on a very large scale), and make them available to their users on an on-demand basis [16].

Reference-contexts: Metadata are "data about data." In our context, this means that they contain concise information about the location and characteristics of the data to be retrieved (e.g., movie titles, where they are stored) <ref> [8] </ref>. By using such a scheme, the data delivery process can be decoupled from the database management functions. The advantage of this metadata approach is that it allows the user examine the contents of a database without having to retrieve the large objects. <p> The metadata server must maintain the relationships between these diverse objects and inform their presence to the client whenever a query is made. In the context of a VOD server, the system must store different movie attributes. Movie-specific attributes include entities such as actor, producer, title, shot, scene, etc. <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.2 Distributed Resource Server For a movie database, resource attributes include the parametric loads on individual storage subsystems and subnetworks; and the number of users currently accessing the VOD system. <p> The Virtual Video Browser (VVB) is an interactive VOD prototype designed to allow the browsing of a database of movies and the subsequent playout of in 4 UDP for our implementation. 5 TCP for our implementation. 10 dividual movies <ref> [8] </ref>. It incorporates a simple query interface which lets users specify their preferences to the system to retrieve the appropriate video. The VVB is designed to work in a distributed environment where movies are stored in different databases interconnected via a network.

Reference-contexts: There are several requirements for the metadata management scheme necessary to support interactive multimedia applications. First, we require basic services to support object identification, location, naming, and distribution <ref> [9] </ref>. Second, application-specific models are required to support application functionality (e.g., searches on movie scene content). In the former, we can also consider the limitations of available I/O bandwidths for individual storage devices at data servers.

To support many users, significant system communication and storage I/O are required. Local storage on a single user computer is not feasible due to the high cost per user. The distribution of data and use of multiple access points increases the system's overall I/O capacity to support interactive sessions.
