Reference-contexts: As for foreign faculty, there are very few in Japanese universities other than visitors such as ourselves. In fact, one report noted that, as of 1989, there were seven non-Japanese tenured faculty in any discipline whatsoever at all national universities in Japan <ref> [Gel90] </ref>. A final difference between U.S. and Japanese professorships is compensation. In Japan, all faculty in all disciplines and at all national universities are paid on the same schedule that takes into account both rank and time of service.

Reference-contexts: We do believe, however, that it accurately relates our impressions based on sabbatical stays and several return visits. 2 One Japanese view of this situation can be found in <ref> [Ich92] </ref>. 14 We also find that these impressions are consistent with other colleagues who have visited Japan from time to time.

Reference-contexts: The duties that one would associate with such a position elsewhere are handled by the joshu and graduate students as a matter of course. The relative lack of staff support has also been noted in Japanese government laboratories doing work in computer science <ref> [Kah90] </ref>. Each laboratory is associated with a given subject area, which is the formal focus of the research performed by its members. For example, the chairs in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at Osaka University include such areas as Programming Languages, Computing Mechanisms, and Intelligent Information Engineering.

Reference-contexts: This is not a systematic or complete survey, but instead a collection of informal, but perhaps still enlightening, observations. This paper can also be viewed as augmenting and updating earlier papers on computer science research in Japan <ref> [Kim83, Sto84] </ref>; although some of our observations agree with points made in those papers, it is evident that the discipline has evolved in the intervening years.
