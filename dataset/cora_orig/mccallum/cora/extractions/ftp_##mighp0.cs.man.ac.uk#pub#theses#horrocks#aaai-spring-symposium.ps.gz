Reference-contexts: The case for transitive roles seems unanswerable for medical applications. No sensible representation of anatomy is possible which excludes transitive partitive relationships. Once the transitive closure of roles is available 3 , the worst case complexity is equivalent to that for concept inclusions <ref> (Baader 1991) </ref>, but concept inclusions still add a major practical burden. There are two uses of concept inclusions which seem unavoidable given the overall goals of the project: supporting multiple viewpoints through the expression of `implicit' information and the propagation of values along transitive roles.

Reference-contexts: This paper reports primarily on the use of the constructs for medical applications and hence the motivation for the inclusion of potentially intractable features. The same constructs and representational style have also been used for describing the functioning of protein and DNA sequences <ref> (Goble, Paton, & Bechhofer 1996) </ref>, images for art history, and is being investigated as the basis for representation the structure of multi-media applications (Bechhofer & Goble 1996). <p> The same constructs and representational style have also been used for describing the functioning of protein and DNA sequences (Goble, Paton, & Bechhofer 1996), images for art history, and is being investigated as the basis for representation the structure of multi-media applications <ref> (Bechhofer & Goble 1996) </ref>. Summary of GRAIL Semantics One of the features of GRAIL which makes it more accessible to domain experts is a non-standard notation, the critical subset of which is summarised and defined in terms of the more usual description logic notation in table 1.

Reference-contexts: GALEN assumes that the historical pattern will continue whereby different groups develop ontologies (terminologies and classifications), medical record schemata and decision support systems. The demand from the medical informatics community is for common `controlled vocabularies' (Sittig 1994) or concept systems <ref> (Evans et al. 1994) </ref>. Implicitly the demand is that navigation and inference be at the level of the types in the classification. Therefore, a separate `A-Box' with supplementary rules for classifying individuals is unacceptable as part of the `reusable ontology'.
