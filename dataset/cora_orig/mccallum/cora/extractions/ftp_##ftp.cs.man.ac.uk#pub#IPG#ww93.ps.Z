Title: Using process technology to support cooperative work: prospects and design issues

Abstract: This chapter describes a form of technology known as PSS (Process Support System). PSS provides a set of techniques for modelling cooperative work and a exible generic technology for building office information systems. The chapter introduces a number of related office technologies to set the scene for a description of PSS. The approach to process modelling in PSS is introduced using a medical case study, which is also used to give a avour of the experience of process supported office work. Epistemological and methodological issues in process modelling are explored. Several lines of work are highlighted, including the development of a design methodology for PSS and language-action approaches to process modelling. A major implementation of PSS is described in outline. Issues arising from field studies are discussed, e.g. the question of the routineness of so-called routine work.

Reference-contexts: In common, the SSMs insist that the role of the analyst is to seek out diversity and to construct a so-called rich picture of the problem situation accommodating as many worldviews as possible. One well known SSM is Checklands soft systems methodology <ref> (Checkland, 1981) </ref> which Lyytinen (1988) discusses in the ISD context. Another interesting approach is Colin Edens Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA) methodology (Eden 1989).

Reference-contexts: The dependencies between Roles are referred to as Interactions. Such dependencies normally reect the need of two Roles to exchange information, e.g. that person A needs to transmit such-and-such a document to person B etc. The original implementation of PML was written in SMALLTALK <ref> (Goldberg, 1984) </ref> and the language has a distinctive object-oriented avour. The main constructs are all conceptualised as objects (Roles, Actions etc.).

Reference-contexts: Electronic mail, however, does not count for some as CSCW, because it is not really tuned (or tunable) to the needs of the work group <ref> (Greif, 1988) </ref>. Technologies which support routine work would appear to fall into a particularly controversial category. Traditional office automation systems come under this heading.

Reference-contexts: The technical perspective has considerable difficulty in dealing with the all too common phenomenon of system failure (Hirschheim and Newman, 1988), failure being defined as a significant gap between the expectations of users (managers, end-users) and the actual performance of the system <ref> (Lyytinen, 1988) </ref>. Hirschheim et al (1987) have developed an alternative model of system development, which they call the Social Action perspective. This perspective sees system development as a social process characterised by purposeful interaction between designers and users.

Reference-contexts: This example draws on a independent project, known as the Clinical Information Systems Project (CISP), which was set up in 1988 <ref> (for background see Wastell et al., 1987) </ref> to investigate computer support for hospital work. The field-work for the project was carried out in the Cardiology department of the Manchester Royal Infirmary (a large teaching hospital adjacent to the University) and the focus of the investigation was the medical office.

Reference-contexts: From his field observations, Gasser concludes it is anything but routine. It is quite wrong to regard routine work as the slavish following of bureaucratic rules and procedures. Much of so-called routine work is skilled problem-solving <ref> (see also Wynn, 1979) </ref>. Offices are open systems; anomaly is ubiquitous; often the correct procedure is not mechanically obvious, indeed often procedures must be adapted to suit the exigencies of the situation. For these reasons, no formal description can ever completely cover the contingent, ever-varying character of real work.
