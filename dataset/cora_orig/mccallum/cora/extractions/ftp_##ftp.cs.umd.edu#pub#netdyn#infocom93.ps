Abstract: Over the last decade Internet has grown by orders of magnitude in size. Many of the protocols that were designed several years ago are still in use. It is not clear if the assumptions made in the design of control schemes still hold, particularly when we consider end-to-end behavior of paths in the network, today. This paper describes a simple experiment designed to capture end-to-end behavior of the Internet. The measurements indicate that the IP level service provided in the network yields high losses, duplicates and reorder-ings of packets. In addition, the round-trip transit delay varies significantly. These measurements indicate that the network may have several problems which still need to be analysed in order to improve the efficiency of protocols and control mechanisms that it uses.

Reference-contexts: One of the design goals was to ensure that the measurement setup does not cause significant additional load on the network. The user level behavior of a path through the Internet was observed using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [11] </ref>. This allowed us to conduct controlled experiments using application level software, without requiring any modification to the kernel implementation of Internet protocol suite.

Reference-contexts: Since UDP does not define (nor implement) any flow control and transfers packets to IP with minimal processing, we are able to assess IP level performance of a path. Note that TCP <ref> [12] </ref> could not be used for this purpose since losses, duplicates and reorderings are not visible to an application process. An alternate way of measuring network layer performance would have been to use IP LSRR option to route the packet via a remote host.
