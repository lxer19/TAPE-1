Abstract: This tech report is not meant to be an exhaustively complete methodology for taking TDR measurements. It is simply a summary of my experiences with the 11801A and IPA310. I would refer you to their manuals for a more in-depth explanation of how to use the equipment. This tech report is intended to get you started and to help you avoid some of the more common yet frustrating pitfalls.
