Abstract: The goal of this panel is to formulate a set of such challenge problems for the field. Each panelist was asked to formulate one or more challenges. The emphasis is on problems for which there is a good chance that they will be resolved within the next five to ten years. A good example of the potential benefit of a concrete AI challenge problem is the recent success of Deep Blue. Deep Blue is the result of a research effort focused on a single problem: develop a program to defeat the world chess champion. Although Deep Blue has not yet quite achieved this goal, it played a remarkably strong game against Kasparov in the recent ACM Chess Challenge Match. A key lesson we learn from Deep Blue's strength is that efficient brute-force search can be much more effective than sophisticated, heuristically guided search. In fact, brute-force was so successful that it led Kas-parov to exclaim "I could feel | I could smell | a new The experience with Deep Blue shows that a good challenge problem can focus research, lead to concrete progress, and bring us important new insights. Many AI researchers may not like the particular lesson about the value of brute-force over more "intelligent" forms of search, but, nevertheless, it is a very tangible result. In fact, the issue of general purpose ultra-fast search procedures versus heuristically guided domain-dependent methods is currently being revisited in the search and reasoning community. Finally, as a meta-issue, we will consider how to measure progress in the field. Determining whether a particular piece of work in AI actually brings us any closer to the ultimate goals of AI has proven to be quite difficult. By introducing a set of well-defined challenge problems, we hope that this panel will help provide some benchmarks against which we can measure research progress. There are two very different sorts of challenges that I see for Artificial Intelligence | first, our systems are pathetic compared to biological systems, along many dimensions, and secondly, moderately good performance from some approaches has sociologically led to winner-take-all trends in research where other promising lines of research have been snuffed out too soon.
