Reference-contexts: This is surely utterly chimerical and hardly deserves any further discussion. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [2] </ref>, p.176) Still, Bar-Hillel did accord the suggestion some further attention, elaborating on why he considered the idea of equipping an MT system with a universal encyclopedia so preposterous. The number of facts we human beings know is, in a certain very pregnant sense, infinite. <p> We know all these additional facts by inferences we are able to perform, and it is clear that they are not, in any serious sense, stored in our memory. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [2] </ref>, p.177) At the core of Bar-Hillels argument, therefore, is not just the fact that translation routinely requires encyclopedic knowledge; i.e. knowledge not about the properties of language but about the real world. <p> As mentioned above, Bar-Hillel was able to envision a machine capable of inferencing; what he found more difficult to imagine was a scheme which would make a machine perform such inferences in the same or similar circumstances under which an intelligent human being would perform them. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [2] </ref>, p.177) And of course, he also discounted any ad hoc procedure, mounted solely for the case at hand, whose futility would show itself in the next example. (ibid, p.174) 8 concern with the practical problems of translation in the real world.

Reference-contexts: the progress made in hardware, programming techniques and linguistic insight, the quality of fully autonomous mechanical translation, even when restricted to scientific and technological material, will never approach that of qualified human translators and therefore MT will only under very exceptional circumstances be able to compete with human translation. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [3] </ref>, p.182; again, my emphasis) To justify this pessimistic prognostic, Bar-Hillel points to the syntactical (or scoping) ambiguity of the adjective in a simple phrase like slow neutrons and protons. <p> Bar-Hillel leaves it to the reader to 4 generalize the argument to the innumerable semantical ambiguities which nothing but plain, factual knowledge or considerations of truthfulness and consistency will resolve... (ibid <ref> [3] </ref>, p.182). <p> A complete automation of the activity is wholly utopian.... The quicker this is understood, the better are the chances that more attention will be paid to finding efficient ways of improving the status of scientific and technological translation ... including judicious and modest use of mechanical aids. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [3] </ref>, p.183) 4. The Future is Now It has now been over thirty years since Bar-Hillel published these provocative views on the future of machine translation. Of course, the future is by definition boundless.

Reference-contexts: field] could be expected of electronic computers but ... entertained some hopes that by exploiting the redundance of natural language texts better than human readers usually do, we should perhaps be in a position to enable the computers to overcome, at least partly, their lack of knowledge and understanding. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [4] </ref>, p.213) For Bar-Hillel, however, those hopes were short-lived. <p> Given his remarkable foresight, we would be rash to disregard the warning he formulated in 1962: it would be disastrous to extrapolate from these primitive exhibitions of artificial intelligence to something like translation. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [4] </ref>, p.214) 6. A Radical Change of Approach In summary: an objective assessment of the state of the art in MT would seem to suggest that the field is still in fact mired in the same impasse that Bar-Hillel described in the early 60s.

Reference-contexts: On this point at least, Bar-Hillel has turned out to be undeniably correct. While accurate data 2. Those who are interested in MT as a primarily practical device must realize that full automation of the translation process is incompatible with high quality. (Bar-Hillel <ref> [5] </ref>, p.167) 5 on the world translation market are notoriously difficult to obtain, I am aware of no studies or estimates that accord machine translation more than 5% of that market and that figure appears to me to be generous. <p> genuinely radical change of approach should take? The citation reproduced at the end of section 3 above does provide one clue, where Bar-Hillel mentions the possibility of a judicious and modest use of mechanical aids. (Here the emphasis is in the original.) In his Aims and Methods in Machine Translation <ref> [5] </ref>, Bar-Hillel is even more explicit: The only reasonable aim, then, for short-range research into MT seems to be that of finding some machinepost-editor partnership that would be commercially competitive with existing human translation, and then try to improve the commercial competitiveness of this partnership by improving the programming in order <p> But generally speaking, MAHT has not 8. The standard reference for SMT is Brown et al. [9], and for EBMT, Sato and Nagao [10]. The former approach, of course, does have historical antecedents, on which Bar-Hillel also had some very interesting things to say. See especially Bar-Hillel <ref> [5] </ref>, p.171. 9. Again, the distinction between MAHT and HAMT may be framed in terms of which of the two man or machine retains the initiative in the translation process.

Reference-contexts: use in carrying out tasks such as translating, summarizing or answering a question? Such software has been the goal of research projects in artificial intelligence since the mid-1960s, when the necessary computer hardware and programming techniques began to appear even as the impracticability of machine translation was becoming apparent... (Winograd <ref> [6] </ref>, p.136) Winograd briey reviews some of the better known NLP projects in the 70s and 80s that attempted to encode knowledge of the world in a form that a program could use to draw inferences (e.g. Schanks scripts). <p> The limitations on the formalization of contextual meaning make it impossible at present and conceivably forever to design computer programs that come close to full mimicry of human language understanding. (Winograd <ref> [6] </ref>, p.142) But does this necessarily entail that computers will never be able to translate adequately? Perhaps it might still be possible to design programs that would allow a machine to produce relatively high quality translations without having to simulate the full extent of human language understanding; if not all the

Reference-contexts: Sergei Nirenburg, a longtime stalwart of the knowledge-based approach to machine translation, is one of these. He and Kenneth Goodman published a brave article <ref> [7] </ref> in 1990, in which they systematically take up many of the criticisms that are frequently directed against meaning-based (or interlingual) MT, and expose the double standards and many of the inconsistencies in the arguments that are often employed to repudiate and even disparage the interlingual paradigm.

Reference-contexts: Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence and in computing technology, the situation is unlikely to improve in the near future: the sheer complexity and intractibility of real world knowledge are the principal impediments to quick solutions. (Hutchins & Somers <ref> [8] </ref>, p.93) Hence, it seems fairly safe to say that Bar-Hillel would not have substantially modified his views on the feasibility of FAHQT, had he lived beyond 1975 to witness some of the impressive successes in artificial intelligence.

Reference-contexts: Texts in domains such as economics or statistics can be packed full of such expressions, and the smallest error in one digit is tantamount to a serious mistranslation: not only is it extremely embarrassing for the translator, but it can 10. For more on this paradigm shift, see Isabelle <ref> [12] </ref>, where the author outlines some of the reasons why the classical rule-based approach to MT has produced so few useful results in the way of translator support tools, and why, on the contrary, the corpus-based approach seems to lend itself so well to MAHT. 11 undermine the credibility of the

Reference-contexts: The project in question is called TransCheck, and it is documented more fully in Macklovitch <ref> [13] </ref>. As its name suggests, TransCheck is intended to be used as a translation checker, somewhat like a spelling checker. <p> Preliminary tests of the first prototype have produced encouraging results, confirming the general viability of a translation checker based on a sentence alignment program and a part-of-speech tagger; again, see <ref> [13] </ref> for further discussion. Ultimately, of course, it is hoped that TransCheck will be able to detect more subtle types of translation errors, and that end users will be able to modify the contents of the database so that it reects their own translation norms.

Reference-contexts: Less obviously, the text in one language may use a numeral, e.g. the date 1994, where the translation properly refers to the same period by means of a nonnumerical noun phrase like last year. 12.
