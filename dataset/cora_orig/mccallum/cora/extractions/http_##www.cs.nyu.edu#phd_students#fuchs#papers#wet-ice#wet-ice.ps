Title: Let's Talk: extending the Web to support collaboration

Abstract: The current Web architecture is insufficient to support collaboration among independent human and computational agents. Communication, other than between browser and server, such as among servers, or between a browser and local applications, requires exiting the Web's suite of technologies. HTML and Java are not particularly good languages for communicating among agents. We propose extending the Web to allow a variety of domain-specific little languages. Messages would be in these languages, and cognizant agents can manipulate them freely, such as display them to humans or otherwise process them. Semantics for these languages can be retrieved dynamically over the Web, providing scalable intelligence. SGML and IDL are two current systems capable of providing such languages. An SGML based Web would remain upwardly compatible with the current one.

Reference-contexts: Examples of this mismatch abound in the Web and result from basic design decisions in the original architecture, such as modeling Web access as a random walk among random blobs of URL-laden text. We start with the Web's most fundamental product, HTML <ref> [1] </ref>. HTML has two basic functions: 1. Describe a screen layout for human observation. 2. Embed hyperlinks for eventual selection by a human.

Reference-contexts: There is no necessary incompatibility between the proposed approach and these two others. KIF is a reasonable way to extend the client until it becomes a truly intelligent agent. EDI standards <ref> [3] </ref>, such as HL7, are alternative means to SGML for specifying messages to be sent between agents. They concentrate heavily on the specific linear layout of each communication, but they also describe, in depth, the meaning of each communication in the context of an exchange.

Reference-contexts: Sighted and blind humans (or humans momentarily lacking a bit-mapped display) cannot communicate with it; HTML contains no information on how to extract information for an Audio Response Unit. For the same reasons, Java <ref> [5] </ref> and HTML do not coexist very well. Although an applet can generate HTML, and Java code can be written to verify the content of forms, etc., applets do not use HTML as a communication language. Two more related problems are: 1.

Reference-contexts: The other major alternative approach is KIF/KQML. KIF [8], or Knowledge Interchange Format, is a means for specifying ontologies. An ontology is a complete description, in first-order predicate calculus, of a particular domain. KQML <ref> [6] </ref>, the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, is a wrapper language for communicating among intelligent agents. KQML designates characteristics of the communication, such as what kind of action it represents, but does not specify the language of the message contents, which can be SGML.

Reference-contexts: Within a particular site, or among agents who accept the DTD, communication can remain in SGML. EDI standards, based on the generation of fixed-format strings, do not look likely to show the same degree of scalable intelligence as SGML. The other major alternative approach is KIF/KQML.

Reference-contexts: An SGML-based Web would include the current Web as a special case. It would also merge the Web with other standards efforts based on or using SGML, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)[2] or the U.S. Department of Defense's Computer Acquisition and Life-cycle Support (CALS) effort <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 An example Our scenario is based on the ARTEMIS rural health care project [9].
