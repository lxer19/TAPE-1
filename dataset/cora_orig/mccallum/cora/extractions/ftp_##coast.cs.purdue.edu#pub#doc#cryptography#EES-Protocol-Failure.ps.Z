Title: Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard

Abstract: The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) defines a US Government family of cryptographic processors, popularly known as "Clipper" chips, intended to protect unclassified government and private-sector communications and data. A basic feature of key setup between pairs of EES processors involves the exchange of a "Law Enforcement Access Field" (LEAF) that contains an encrypted copy of the current session key. The LEAF is intended to facilitate government access to the cleartext of data encrypted under the system. Several aspects of the design of the EES, which employs a classified cipher algorithm and tamper-resistant hardware, attempt to make it infeasible to deploy the system without transmitting the LEAF. We evaluated the publicly released aspects of the EES protocols as well as a prototype version of a PCMCIA-based EES device. This paper outlines various techniques that enable cryptographic communication among EES processors without transmission of the valid LEAF. We identify two classes of techniques. The simplest allow communication only between pairs of "rogue" parties. The second, more complex methods permit rogue applications to take unilateral action to interoperate with legal EES users. We conclude with techniques that could make the fielded EES architecture more robust against these failures.

Reference-contexts: A refinement on this approach encrypts only the LEAF. A LEAF encryption scheme could be integrated into a key exchange protocol that produces "extra" shared secret bits (such as Diffie-Hellman <ref> [DH76] </ref>). Since only 80 bits are required for the Skipjack session key, 128 of the other bits could be used as a Vernam cipher against the LEAF.

The proposal, called the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) [NIST94], includes several unusual features that have been the subject of considerable debate and controversy.

Reference-contexts: At present, two EES devices are being produced. The simplest, the Clipper chip (also known as the MYK-78), is essentially a drop-in replacement for a conventional DES <ref> [NBS77] </ref> chip and relies on key negotiation being handled off the chip. The other EES device, the Capstone chip (MYK-80), adds built-in support for public-key negotiation and digital signatures, with modular arithmetic functions, random number generation, and other such features.

Reference-contexts: The interface to the Skipjack cipher is similar to that of DES, based on a 64 bit codebook block cipher and supporting FIPS-81 <ref> [NBS80] </ref> standard modes of operation. Keys are 80 bits in length, as opposed to DES's 56 bits. The initial application of EES is in stand-alone voice encryption telephone units, such as the AT&T Model 3600 Telephone Security Device.

The proposal, called the Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) <ref> [NIST94] </ref>, includes several unusual features that have been the subject of considerable debate and controversy. The EES cipher algorithm, called "Skipjack", is itself classified, and implementations of the cipher are available to the private sector only within tamper-resistant modules supplied by government-approved vendors.

Reference-contexts: The 32 bit unit ID field appears to be at the minimum possible size given the intended scope of the EES program (a previous version of the LEAF with a 25 bit unit ID was considered inadequate <ref> [NIST94a] </ref>). It may be possible to use bits from the encrypted session key field to increase the checksum size, at some expense in law enforcement wiretap access performance.
