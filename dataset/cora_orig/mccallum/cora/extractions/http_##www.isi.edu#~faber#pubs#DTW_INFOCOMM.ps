Abstract: This paper presents mechanisms for congestion control of data traffic in high speed wide area networks (HSWANs). The network model assumes reservation of resources based on average requirements. The mechanisms address (a) the different time scales for network congestion (short term and medium-term), (b) admission control that allows controlled variance of traffic as a function of medium-term congestion (Dynamic Time Windows), and (c) prioritized switch scheduling, based on a new fairness criterion for short term congestion (Pulse). This latter criterion is proposed as the appropriate fairness measure for HSWANs. Preliminary performance studies show that when network utilization approaches unity, the Dynamic Time Window admission control can protect the network from buffer overruns and excessive queuing delays, and when network utilization level is smaller, the admission control may be relaxed to allow a controlled amount of variance that attempts to simultaneously meet the performance goals of the end-user and that of the network provider. The Pulse prioritized switch scheduling algorithm proposed and studied in this paper is a generalization of the Virtual Clock algorithm [Zhang 91]. g simulation and (limited) analytical results for expected queu ing times in switches,

Reference-contexts: Parts 1 (a) and 1 (b) above contradict a previous finding in [Zha 91]. If the scheduling discipline is Virtual Clock, then the virtual clocks of a set of sources were thought to diverge with respect to each other as time progressed. However, the theory of coupled stochastic processes <ref> [Gre 78] </ref> suggests that if the sources are statistically homogeneous, then they would in fact converge almost surely, every so often.

Reference-contexts: To deal with short-term bursts, new open-loop protocols have recently been proposed to meter and police the traffic on each connection <ref> [BCS 90, Gol 91, Tur 86, SLCG 89, Zha 89] </ref>. <p> DTW, in conjunction with Pulse / Generalized Virtual Clocks (discussed in the next section), extends and generalizes Distributed Source Control to handle multiple time constants in the network. g Leaky Bucket <ref> [BCS 90, SLGC 89, Tur 86] </ref> is another technique that has been proposed for admission control. In Leaky Bucket, a fixed sized bucket is associated with each transmitter and it is fed with tokens at some constant rate. If the bucket is full, tokens are dropped. <p> These algorithms attempt to schedule traffic inside the network.

Reference-contexts: DTW allows con trol of these characteristics of the source. With rate based schemes: g Zhang <ref> [Zha 91] </ref> and Golestani [Gol 91] characterize traffic workload as an average rate over a specified interval. They devise scheduling algorithms, given this workload. DTW attempts to adjust the workload itself (traffic shaping), if the network is congested. <p> They devise scheduling algorithms, given this workload. DTW attempts to adjust the workload itself (traffic shaping), if the network is congested. In conjunction with this, Pulse may be used to facilitate scheduling of bursts over the intervals. Unlike the User Behavior Envelope proposed by Zhang <ref> [Zha 91] </ref>, DTW adapts to network congestion levels, allowing sources greater burstiness when the network load is lighter. g Ramamurthy and Dighe proposed the Distributed Source Control Protocol [RaDi 91]. <p> Pulse Scheduling The proposed solution to priority scheduling, Pulse, extends the Virtual Clock algorithm <ref> [Zha 91] </ref>. We describe this latter algorithm first, then the proposed extension along with motivation for doing so. A new fairness criterion appropriate for this environment is defined and appropriate properties of a scheduling algorithm with respect to this criterion are identified (Proposition 1). <p> Hence, there is no unique fair prior ity assignment curve. (3) N i = S l l i hhhhh N, where N is conserved, i.e., N is constant across all scheduling disciplines. Parts 1 (a) and 1 (b) above contradict a previous finding in <ref> [Zha 91] </ref>. If the scheduling discipline is Virtual Clock, then the virtual clocks of a set of sources were thought to diverge with respect to each other as time progressed.
