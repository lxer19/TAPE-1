Reference-contexts: The class EMPLOYEE has FULL-TIME and PART-TIME as its subclasses. The class FULL-TIME has EMPLOYEE as its superclass. The instances JOHN, JOAN, BILL, MARY and LARRY each have a unique base class. For more details on inheritance refer to [Wegner90]. According to <ref> [Desai] </ref>, with respect to Class-Hierarchy and the IS-A relationship, an instance of a class belongs to its superclasses and it supersuperclass because of the IS-A relationship. In Postgres, if we add a new instance variable to a class, the new instance variable does not propagate to its subclasses. <p> As we just mentioned, an instance of a class belongs to its superclasses and its supersuperclass; so these instances should belong to class EMPLOYEE, and contain the instance variable address. To overcome this problem and keep the database hierarchy as was mentioned in <ref> [Desai] </ref>, GDEP modified the Postquel add attribute to a class function, and propagates the new added attribute to all instances of the modified class. The GDEP user does not have a choice not to propagate the new added instance variable to its subclasses.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Motif provides the widgets themselves, plus an array of utility and convenience functions for creating groups of widgets that are used collectively as a single type of user-interface element. The reader may also refer to <ref> [Motif] </ref> for more details on the Motif Toolkit. 1.4 Overview of GDEP GDEP is a Graphical Development Environment for Postgres users. It has many functionalities in addition to some enhancements made to Postgres. <p> Further testing for GDEP is needed on machines other than the one we tested it on, to prove our assumptions. For more information on how to install Postgres, refer to [Pg Rel 4.1]. Also, for more information on how to install Motif, refer to <ref> [Motif] </ref>. 5.1.2 Software GDEP is a package that consists of a Makefile, nine C files that contains the source code for the application, and a document file that contains the documentation for the application.
