Title: An Empirical Study of Min-Conflict Hill Climbing and Weak Commitment Search

Abstract: We investigate the performance of weak commitment search and min-conflict hill climbing inside the hard region of constraint satisfaction problems. Weak commitment search combines systematic and nonsystematic strategies. In a limited number of experiments reported in the literature weak commitment search seems to outperform pure hill-climbing procedures. In this paper we present a more detailed investigation of weak commitment search and min-conflict hill climbing on N-Queens, 3-colouring and randomly generated CSPs. For these problems weak commitment search performs consistently better than min-conflict hill climbing. We explore the conjecture that this is due to the weak commitment (under consistency) to partial solutions. In particular, we venture that the commitment to partial solutions corresponds to the introduction of "noise" in min-conflict hill climbing in a manner that follows a problem's hard region. Experiments which we develop point to an explanation for the synergistic effects of combining systematic and nonsystematic search strategies.

Reference-contexts: problem ensembles are examined in order to explore whether there is a relation between the effects of the commitment to partial solutions and the hard region of CSPs. 3.2 Graph colouring Graph colouring is known to exhibit a phase transition as the average connectivity fl of the graph is varied <ref> [ Cheeseman et al., 1991 ] </ref> . In particular, experiments with Brelaz's algorithm on random reduced 3-colouring problems exhibit a hard region for graphs of average connectivity between 4 and 7, with a peak around 4.6. <p> Figure 7a shows the success rate for MCHC and WCS.

Reference-contexts: Alternative attempts to enhance the performance of systematic search procedures have lead to a number of hybrid algorithms, e.g. arbitrary choice dynamic backtracking, partial order dynamic backtracking <ref> [ Ginsberg and McAllester, 1993 ] </ref> and weak commitment search [ Yokoo, 1994 ] . Initial experiments with these algorithms have yielded successful results where pure local search procedures have failed. Another line of inquiry addresses the distribution of problem instances with respect to search effort.

Reference-contexts: The experiments suggest that this is the reason for the enhanced performance of WCS. A qualitative explanation of the experiments can be obtained by considering the statistical model developed by Minton for the performance of the min-conflict heuristic. According to the simplified model in <ref> [ Johnston and Minton, 1994 ] </ref> , the probability of the min-conflict heuristic making a mistake is, P r (mistake) (k 1)e 2 (pcd) 2 =c where k is the domain size, p is the probability of an incorrect value for a variable V conflicts with an arbitrary value for variable

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Local search procedures have been recently suggested for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), e.g. min-conflict hill climbing <ref> [ Minton et al., 1992 ] </ref> , GSAT [ Selman et al., 1992 ] . The basic idea behind these procedures is to start from a complete (but possibly inconsistent) assignment and then to modify this assignment incrementally in order to satisfy more and more constraints. <p> In particular, experiments with Brelaz's algorithm on random reduced 3-colouring problems exhibit a hard region for graphs of average connectivity between 4 and 7, with a peak around 4.6. Other experiments have shown that the same properties hold for random solvable ensembles of 3-colouring problems. In <ref> [ Minton et al., 1992 ] </ref> MCHC has been tested for solvable sparse graphs (with average connectivity 4) and dense solvable graphs (with average connectivity (n-1)/2). <p> For our experiments we generated 100 instances of 60 node 3-colouring problems with connectivities in the range 3-7 (with 0.1 step), using the same method as in <ref> [ Minton et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Since we are interested in the effect of the commitment to partial solutions, we use the basic WCS (without Brelaz's heuristics and forward checking). As before, a greedy initial assignment is generated for each graph and the limit of 2000 steps is used.

Reference-contexts: The recording mechanism. The recording of no-goods increases the number of conflicts for the variables participating in the current assignment. This increases the probability of making uphill moves. The behaviour is similar to the weighting strategy proposed to improve the performance of hill-climbing procedures <ref> [ Morris, 1994; Selman and Kautz, 1993 ] </ref> . The distribution of variables for WCS is almost uniform while for MCHC it is biased towards certain variables. This means that MCHC is getting trapped in local areas, where it repeatedly makes changes to a limited number of variables.

Reference-contexts: For our study we generated an ensemble of solvable 3 random CSPs with parameters n = 30, m = 10, p 1 = 0:5 and p 2 varying between 0.2 and 0.5 with increments of 0.01. This setting corresponds to the observed hard region of the ensemble <ref> [ Prosser, 1994 ] </ref> , and exhibits a peak around p 2 = 0:26. For each value of p 2 we generated 20 problems (a total of 600 problems) using a greedy algorithm. Again the basic version of WCS was used. <p> Again the basic version of WCS was used. Figure 9a depicts the success rate for WCS and MCHC for the generated random CSPs. WCS seems to follow closely the hard region for this ensemble <ref> [ Prosser, 1994 ] </ref> .
