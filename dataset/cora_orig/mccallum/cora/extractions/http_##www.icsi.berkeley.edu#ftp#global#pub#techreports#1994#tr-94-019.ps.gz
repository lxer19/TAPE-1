Abstract: There is a universal component to the semantics of reduplication, which can be expressed as a radial category of concepts. I present this radial category, along with supporting evidence from a range of languages, and motivations for the links between the various senses. The structure of the radial graph gives rise to a number of predicted implicational universals. I also show that the radial category for reduplication shares an entire subsystem of concepts with the radial category for the Russian verbal prefix raz-. This sharing of subsystems of concepts across separate radial categories suggests that there is a single universal core conceptual network, with individual constructions covering different, possibly overlapping, regions.

Reference-contexts: Repetition is therefore a part of the semantics of incrementality, so the use of a form meaning repetition to also mean incrementality is well motivated metonymically. Continuity The use of reduplication to express continuity has been noticed by many researchers. Reduplication expresses continuative aspect in Tagalog <ref> (French 1988) </ref> and Javanese (Niepokuj 1991). In addition, the continuative sense of reduplication is evident in Iraqi Arabic t . ant . an (to buzz or hum), Hindi kit kit (monotonous droning on), and arguably English dilly-dally.

Reference-contexts: This can be motivated via the metaphorical conceptual link POWER 6 AND IMPORTANCE IS SIZE, linking small to contempt <ref> (Jurafsky 1993) </ref>. Jurafsky, in his work on the semantics of the diminutive, points out that this metaphor can be seen in the semantics of the English -y suffix: while often used for diminution (e.g. doggy), -y can also express derogation or contempt (e.g. limey, a derogatory term for an Englishman).

Reference-contexts: I shall cast the various meanings expressed by reduplication as a radial category of concepts <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref>. This construct allows one to express the relations between various senses of a linguistic unit, without assuming that there exists a single abstract meaning which covers all these senses and no others.

Reference-contexts: Russian tjap-ljap (in a slipshod manner) and Bengali ulat-palat (helter-skelter). Other senses which recur cross-linguistically include intensity, increased quantity, scattering, plurality, diversity, member of a class, repetition, continuation, more than appropriate, diminution, endearment, contempt, attenuation, augmentation, similarity, derogation, and habituality <ref> (Moravcsik 1978) </ref>. In addition to these, Nomura & Kiy-omi (1993) note disorder, carelessness, pretense, reciprocity, aimlessness, and attempt. <p> Plurality The use of reduplication to express plurality is widespread, appearing in Dakota, Agta (Niepokuj 1991), Comox (Sapir 1915), the Australian language Djaru (Nomura & Kiyomi 1993), Papago, Samoan, and numerous other languages <ref> (Moravcsik 1978) </ref>. There are several variations on this general theme, reduplication sometimes expressing simple nominal plurality, sometimes plurality of verbal subject, sometimes plurality of verbal object, etc. <p> Lack of Specificity Farsi hulu-mulu peaches and such (hulu peach) Latin quisquis whoever (quis who) Pal. Arabic kaza-kaza whatchamacallit Sundanese sahasaha whoever (saha who) Lack of specificity is expressed by reduplication in a range of languages, including those shown above, Khasi and Turkish <ref> (Moravcsik 1978) </ref>, Hindi, and Uzbek. <p> In addition to the examples listed above, this sense appears in Dakota, Turkish, Dagur, Perak Malay, Tangale (Niepokuj 1991), Sundanese, and Thai <ref> (Moravcsik 1978) </ref>. There are at least two possible sources of motivation for this use. One of these is a link from plurality, highlighted by the English expressions many thanks (Moravcsik 1978) and a thousand pardons, in which quantity is used to express intensity. <p> addition to the examples listed above, this sense appears in Dakota, Turkish, Dagur, Perak Malay, Tangale (Niepokuj 1991), Sundanese, and Thai <ref> (Moravcsik 1978) </ref>. There are at least two possible sources of motivation for this use. One of these is a link from plurality, highlighted by the English expressions many thanks (Moravcsik 1978) and a thousand pardons, in which quantity is used to express intensity. The other is a link from spread out, or perhaps more accurately from the result of spreading out, from enlargement. <p> Thanks also to Dan Jurafsky, Srini Narayanan, Clay Scott, Len Talmy, and Nancy Urban for enjoyable and helpful conversations related to this work.

An example of this from the Bantu language Ewondo is b=-b== (to make/do completely), where b= means to make or do <ref> (Nomura & Kiyomi 1993) </ref>. In addition, Moravcsik (1978) notes that reduplication marks the perfect in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Gothic. A plausible motivation for the use of reduplication in this sense stems from intensity: performing an action intensely can lead to completion of the overall action.
