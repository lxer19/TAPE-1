Reference-contexts: It is known that the rate of convergence of a Markov chain can be bounded using the eigenvalues of P (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). Informally, the chain is rapidly mixing if max ( 1 ; j n1 j) is small compared to 1. <p> Let G = (V; E) be the graph on the vertex set V , with (x; y) 2 E if and only if Q (x; y) &gt; 0 and x 6= y. We assume that the elements of E are directed edges. Following [8], Diaconis and Stroock <ref> [4] </ref> proposed a method for bounding t by establishing a simple path fl xy in G from x to y, for each (x; y) 2 V fi V , x 6= y. <p> In a d-ary tree T of depth h, each node which is not a leave has exactly d descendants. The case d = 2 was treated in <ref> [4] </ref>, where it was shown that Eq. 1 gives a bound on t off by a multiplicative factor of h. Indeed, the number of nodes in T is n = (d h+1 1)=(d 1). There is a unique simple path between every pair of points in the tree. <p> Proof The inequality D follows from Theorem 4.2 by considering the unit length function l. Assume now that the graph is edge-transitive. By the definition of and Eq. 4, (; l) for any 2 F and any l. Furthermore, Diaconis and Stroock <ref> [4] </ref> produce l (unit length function) and 2 F (average combination of geodesic paths) so that (; l) = D. Thus D. - 11 - 4.1 Examples We calculate for the complete bipartite graph K a;b and, up to a constant factor, for expander graphs.

Reference-contexts: The two bounds in Eqs. 1 and 2 coincide in the case of random walks on graphs, but are in general incomparable. As observed in <ref> [5, 14] </ref>, the bounds 1 and 2 can be generalized as follows. Let be the set of paths fl xy . <p> We give a different proof of Proposition 1.1 in Section 2, by using the theory of non-negative matrices. Under a general condition, this allows us to characterize the length functions l that minimize (; l). Most of the material in Section 2 has been obtained obtained independently in <ref> [5, 14] </ref>. In Section 3, we give examples where the bound given by a simple length function improves upon the bounds 1 and 2. We provide a heuristic for finding such a length function. In Section 4, we extend our results to the case where is a multicommodity flow.

Reference-contexts: Eq. 3 follows. To show Eq. 4, we first note that (Ml)(e) = Q (e) fl xy 3e Thus, (; l) = max (M l)(e) : (6) for all e 2 E. From the theory of non-negative matrices <ref> [11] </ref>, any non-negative matrix B has a largest eigenvalue (in module) which is non-negative real, and equal to min l max e (Bl)(e)=l (e), where l ranges over the set of positive vectors. (For the rest of this paper, we will refer to this eigenvalue simply as the largest eigenvalue of <p> Since C is closed convex, the norm function attains its minimum on C at some matrix B 0 . Since the matrix B t 0 B 0 is positive, it follows from the theory of non-negative matrices <ref> [11] </ref> that it has a unique (positive) largest eigenvalue. Therefore, the norm function is differentiable at B 0 , since jjBjj is equal to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of B t B.

Reference-contexts: They also provided several examples where Eq. 1 gives a good bound on t . Along the same lines, Sinclair <ref> [12] </ref> showed that t max 1 X jfl xy j (x)(y); (2) where jfl xy j is the number of edges in fl xy . The two bounds in Eqs. 1 and 2 coincide in the case of random walks on graphs, but are in general incomparable. <p> We provide a heuristic for finding such a length function. In Section 4, we extend our results to the case where is a multicommodity flow. Multicom-modity flow has be used in <ref> [12] </ref> in the case of the unit length function. We show that the best bound on t that can be obtained via this method, over all flows and length functions, can be computed at an arbitrary precision in polynomial time by a reduction to a semidefinite program. <p> The chain is ergodic and reversible, with stationary distribution (i) = r i =Z, where r = fi=(1 fi), and Z = (1 r n )=(1 r). This example was considered in <ref> [12] </ref> where it is shown that, when r is fixed, the bound on t given by Eq. 2 is linear in n, whereas t is of constant order. Indeed, Q (i 1; i) = fir i1 =Z, for 1 i n 1. <p> This bound is minimum for ff = r 1=2 , in which case it yields 1 2r 1=2 =(1 + r). This is very close to the exact value of 1 , which is equal to 2r 1=2 cos (=n)=(1 + r). Note that the Cheeger inequality (see <ref> [12] </ref>) gives a constant but weaker bound on t . Examples similar to this one can be found in [3]. 3.2 Bounded-degree graphs Further simplification can be acheived for the nearest neighbor walk on a bounded-degree graph. <p> In contrast, in the case a = 2, deterministic paths will give an (b) bound on t , uniformly in all length functions.

A d-regular graph G is a (d; 1 )-expander if all the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G, besides d, are at most 1 d, where 1 &lt; 1 is a fixed constant. It is known <ref> [12, Th. 8] </ref> that, for any (d; 1 )-expander on n vertices, one can establish simultaneously a flow of unit value between every pair of distinct points such that the total amount of flow traversing any given edge is O (n log n), where the constant behind O depends on 1
