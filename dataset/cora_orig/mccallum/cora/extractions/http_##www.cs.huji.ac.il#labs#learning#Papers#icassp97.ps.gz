Abstract: In this paper we describe a sound classification method, which seems to be applicable to a broad domain of stationary, non-musical sounds, such as machine noises and other man made non periodic sounds. The method is based on matching higher order spectra (HOS) of the acoustic signals and it generalizes our earlier results on classification of sustained musical sounds by higher order statistics. An efficient "decorrelated matched filter" implemetation is presented. The results show good sound classification statistics and a comparison to spectral matching methods is also discussed.

Reference-contexts: The higher order statistical (HOS) propertied of this residual are closely related to the non-linearities of the excitation source [4][1]. We argued that for musical signals this effect can be modeled as a frequency modulating jitter of the harmonics <ref> [2] </ref>. In this work we would like to consider a unifying scheme were the bispectral and trispectral signatures of the sounds serve as features for analysis and classification of pitched (musical) signals and noise-like (machine) sounds with continuous spectrum. 2. <p> By looking at the skewness fl 3 = m 3 = 3 of the signal and the kurtosis fl 4 = m 4 = 4 we have shown that these statistics measure the amount of harmonicity among triplets and larger groups of partials apparent in the signal <ref> [2] </ref>. For musical sounds the moments show a clear distinction between string, woodwind and brass sounds.
