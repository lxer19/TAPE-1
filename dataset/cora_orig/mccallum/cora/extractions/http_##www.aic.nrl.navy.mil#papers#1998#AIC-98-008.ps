Abstract: Dialogue inferencing is the knowledge-intensive process of inferring aspects of a user's problem from its partial description. Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems, which interactively and incrementally elicit a user's problem description, suffer from poor retrieval efficiency (i.e., they prompt the user with questions that the user has already implicitly answered) unless they perform dialogue inferencing. The standard method for dialogue inferencing in CCBR systems requires library designers to supply explicit inferencing rules. This approach is problematic (e.g., maintenance is difficult). We introduce an alternative approach in which the CCBR system guides the library designer in building a domain model. This model and the partial problem description are then given to a query retrieval system (PARKA-DB) to infer any implied answers during a conversation. In an initial empirical evaluation in the NaCoDAE CCBR tool, our approach improved retrieval efficiency without sacrificing retrieval precision.

Reference-contexts: 1 Conversational Case-Based Reasoning The distinguishing benefit of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) <ref> (Aha & Breslow, 1997) </ref> is that users are not required to initially provide a complete description of their problem. Instead, users enter text partially describing their problem and the system assists in further elaborating the problem during a conversation, which ends when the user selects a solution to apply. <p> A model is easy to maintain and assures the correctness and completeness of the inferred rules. We have partially implemented this approach in NaCoDAE (Navy Conversational Decision Aids Environment) <ref> (Breslow & Aha, 1997) </ref>. The following sections describe NaCoDAE, its dialogue inferencing extension, and its initial evaluation. We end with a discussion of future research goals and related research. 2 NaCoDAE Each case C in NaCoDAE's case libraries has three components: 1. <p> As more questions are answered, similarity computations and the resulting case rankings should become more accurate. dialogue inferencing, which is detailed in Section 3.

This extension exploits domain information to increase conversational efficiency by relating questions with text and with each other.

Reference-contexts: We introduce a model-based reasoning approach for solving this problem in which the library designer supplies a domain model of the case library and rules are inferred from the model by the PARKA-DB query retrieval system <ref> (Hendler et al., 1996) </ref>. A model is easy to maintain and assures the correctness and completeness of the inferred rules. We have partially implemented this approach in NaCoDAE (Navy Conversational Decision Aids Environment) (Breslow & Aha, 1997). The following sections describe NaCoDAE, its dialogue inferencing extension, and its initial evaluation. <p> This extension exploits domain information to increase conversational efficiency by relating questions with text and with each other. Otherwise, NaCoDAE would prompt users with questions that have already been implicitly answered. Our model-based approach uses PARKA-DB <ref> (Hendler et al., 1996) </ref> to search for implied answers. We detailed an initial evaluation of this integration, which showed that both types of inferences derivable from the domain model contribute towards improving the retrieval efficiency of conversations.

Reference-contexts: Third, we will formally determine the relationship of model characteristics and potential efficiency gains.

(1994) described how multiple interface modes can be used to facilitate case retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Instead, users enter text partially describing their problem and the system assists in further elaborating the problem during a conversation, which ends when the user selects a solution to apply. Several commercial CCBR tools exist; they have been particularly successful in help-desk and related applications <ref> (Watson, 1997) </ref>. To behave efficiently, the CCBR tool should automatically infer problem description details from the user's text, and more generally infer these details whenever possible during a conversation. Otherwise, the user will be prompted to answer questions that they have already implicitly answered.
