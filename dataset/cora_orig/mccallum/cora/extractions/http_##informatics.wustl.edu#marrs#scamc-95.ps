Abstract: With the consolidation of health care organizations and services, a clinical repository comprising data from a single site is no longer sufficient. Individual patient data are now spread across multiple sites comprising a single enterprise. Users require an integrated view, or at least a common view, of these clinical data across multiple sites. Many issues arise when one tries to merge data from multiple, distinct organizations into an existing schema. We have addressed these issues while extending our clinical repository for Barnes Hospital with data from Jewish Hospital, both of which are members of the recently formed BJC Health System. We describe the architecture of our existing repository, approaches and issues in extending this repository to include multiple sites, and the specific issues we addressed in our system. To control costs and increase efficiency, there has been a substantial increase in the mergers of hospitals, clinics, and other health care organizations. Specialized services often are consolidated at specific sites in these large organizations, resulting in the proliferation of a patients data not only within a hospital but also across many hospitals and other facilities in the organization. A clinical repository with information from a single facility is no longer sufficient. A common view of data from multiple sites must be available for users to capture a patients entire history. Also, decision-support applications that use a clinical repository easily can be ported to other facilities if data from these facilities can be mapped to the repository schema. However, moving from a repository that contains data for a single facility to one that contains data from multiple facilities is not always straightforward. Many syntactic and semantic issues must be addressed when mapping to the repository schema. We have addressed these mapping issues while adding data from Jewish Hospital to our existing clinical repository. Our initial repository was developed to support both production and research decision-support applications that need an integrated view of clinical data from multiple heterogeneous distributed databases within Barnes Hospital. 1 Since the development of this clinical repository, BJC Health System was formed. BJC Health System includes 15 hospitals, including Barnes and Jewish Hospitals, and numerous other health care facilities. The formation of BJC Health System along with the popularity of our decision-support applications for infection control surveillance 2 and medication dose monitoring have driven the requirement to include data from other hospitals in BJC Health System in our repository. Jewish Hospital was chosen because of its close association with Washington University School of Medicine and because Barnes and Jewish Hospitals share support staff for these decision-support applications. In the remainder of the paper, we briey describe the architecture of our repository, discuss alternative approaches for handling data from multiple sites, and provide specific details on our approach and issues we addressed in mapping data from Jewish Hospital to our repository schema. We conclude with a discussion of our approach and future plans for our repository. Our clinical data repository is implemented as a set of relations and constraints in a relational DBMS. Data are retrieved daily from Barnes Hospital information systems, mapped to a global schema, and merged with existing data in the repository. 1 We chose to implement a physical instead of a logical repository for several reasons: technical and administrative access issues; predictability of performance; availability of the data; and ability to provide data abstractions. With a logical repository, data are not redundantly stored in another database. Instead, operations on the logical repository are mapped to operations on possibly multiple underlying systems. Results from these underlying systems are then transformed into the global schema of the logical repository and presented to the user. With a physical repository, we avoid immediate access issues such as distributed concurrency control, transaction management, and security of underlying systems.
