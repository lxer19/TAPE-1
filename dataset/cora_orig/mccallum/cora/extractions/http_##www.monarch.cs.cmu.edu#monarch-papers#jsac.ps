Reference-contexts: Nodes learning the location of a mobile host in this way can cache this location and then send later packets for the mobile host directly to that location. However, none of these proposals (except <ref> [6, 7] </ref>) provide a mechanism for the node learning a mobile host's current location to authenticate it. The result is that a malicious host anywhere in the Internet could easily send forged management or data packets in order to intercept or redirect packets destined to a mobile host. <p> In today's Internet, only hosts connected to the normal packet routing path can cause similar disruption [18]. The only previous mobile host protocol proposal that provides for extensions to guard against this type of attack <ref> [6, 7] </ref> compromises its wide area operation to maintain its authentication mechanisms. <p> A malicious node could send forged management packets, giving incorrect information on a mobile host's location, and could thus misdirect or intercept packets addressed to that mobile host. The only alternative to this risk among previous mobile host protocols <ref> [6, 7] </ref> has been to force all packets addressed to a mobile host to be routed through the mobile host's home network. Such an alternative reduces performance transparency and places additional overhead on the network. <p> Mobile Host Popup Mode Quite often, a mobile host will want to connect to a network where a local agent is not available, at least until IMHP achieves widespread deployment. One possibility is to revert to using a popup mode of operation similar to that described in <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Effectively, a mobile host becomes its own local agent after manually or automatically (using facilities such as DHCP [13]) obtaining a local address to be a care-of address.

The solutions proposed by <ref> [7] </ref> is not applicable as it assumes all hosts on the same subnet as a mobile host are also mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: Each of the proposals has a number of advantages and disadvantages, some of which are discussed in [10, 11]. Proposals have also been made for supporting host mobility in an OSI environment <ref> [12] </ref>. Many of these mobile host protocols provide some form of route optimization that allows other nodes (hosts or routers) to learn the current location of a mobile host, either from management packets or from an IP option attached to data packets.

Reference-contexts: This will happen if either its visitor list entry or location cache entry for the mobile host times out before the mobile host re-registers. If a mobile host is registered away from home, then its home agent must arrange to intercept (for example, through proxy ARP <ref> [14] </ref>) any packets on the home network that are addressed to the mobile host's home address, including packets that have been forwarded to the home network from elsewhere in the network using normal routing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: IMHP thus provides effective authentication today, while providing a good migration path to stronger authentication when available. A more detailed specification of IMHP is found in <ref> [15] </ref>. Section 2 of this paper describes the necessary IMHP infrastructure. Section 3 discusses the IMHP authentication procedures and their operation in the protocol.

Reference-contexts: The base level of authentication defined by IMHP in this case involves performing a checksum of the important fields in the registration packet (or reply) and the shared secret, using the MD5 one-way cryptographic hash function <ref> [17] </ref>. The resulting checksum is sent as the authenticator in registration messages between the mobile host and its home agent. The possibility of replay attacks is minimized by including a monotonically increasing sequence number in registration and reply packets.

Reference-contexts: The result is that a malicious host anywhere in the Internet could easily send forged management or data packets in order to intercept or redirect packets destined to a mobile host. In today's Internet, only hosts connected to the normal packet routing path can cause similar disruption <ref> [18] </ref>. The only previous mobile host protocol proposal that provides for extensions to guard against this type of attack [6, 7] compromises its wide area operation to maintain its authentication mechanisms. <p> IMHP operates equally well in both the local and the wide area, and provides performance transparency and operational transparency to the user. IMHP introduces an optional new mechanism for providing simple authentication of management packets that preserves the level of security found in today's Internet <ref> [18] </ref>, and is designed to accommodate stronger authentication based on public key cryptography or on shared keys that may either be manually administered or provided by a future Internet key management protocol. IMHP thus provides effective authentication today, while providing a good migration path to stronger authentication when available. <p> is defined to make use of strong authentication based on such an infrastructure or based on manually configured keys, but also introduces an optional set of simple new authentication procedures that can be used when no keys are available, yet which preserve the level of security found in today's Internet <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the current Internet, security attacks based on the misuse of ARP <ref> [21] </ref> or ICMP Redirect messages [22], for example, allow any node connected to one of the physical networks on the normal routing path of a packet to intercept or redirect that packet, but such attacks are not possible for nodes not on this path; nodes elsewhere in the Internet can neither <p> When a mobile host moves from its home network to some other network, any ARP cache entries held by correspondent hosts on the home network that indicate the mobile host's MAC address must be deleted. There is no guaranteed way to achieve this within the existing ARP protocol <ref> [21] </ref>, but usually it will be sufficient for the home agent to issue a small number of gratuitous ARP replies whenever a mobile host leaves its home network.
