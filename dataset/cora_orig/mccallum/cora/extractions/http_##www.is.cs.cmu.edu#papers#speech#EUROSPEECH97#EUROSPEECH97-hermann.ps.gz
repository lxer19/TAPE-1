Title: RECOGNITION OF SPOKEN AND SPELLED PROPER NAMES

Abstract: In this paper we compare the performance for proper name recognition when a name is spoken only, spelled only, or both spoken and spelled. In the latter case, information about the same name is provided in two different representations. We address methods to exploit this redundancy and propose techniques to handle the recognition of large lists of spoken and spelled proper names.

Reference-contexts: Junqua et. al. [6] employ a sophisticated multi-pass strategy to narrow down the list of name candidates. In <ref> [1] </ref> we compare several methods to constrain the search to a given list of names. Best results were achieved on a conceptionally simple tree-based method which is demonstrated on very large name lists in [5]. <p> Without using any language modeling, the speaker-independent recognition rate of continuously spelled letter sequences is about 90% letter accuracy. We have experimented with various techniques to recognize spelled names from large lists of names <ref> [1] </ref>. The most successful approach turned out to be a search in which all spelled names are compiled into one large tree structure.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we will describe some experiments where it is not a priori known if a name is spelled only, or spoken and spelled (section 5). 1.6. Related Work Work on name retrieval from spellings is reported by many researchers. Cole et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> use individually scored letters to search names in a tree-structured database of (1) Please speak your name: "Smith" Please spell it: "S M I T H" (2) Please speak and spell your name: "Smith, S M I T H" (3) What's your name? : "My name is Smith, that's S

Reference-contexts: JANUS The JANUS recognizer was trained and tested on the 1996 Verbmobil Evaluation data (a spontaneous scheduling task with a 5000 word vocabulary), achieving a word accuracy 1 of 86.2% in the official 1996 Verbmobil test set <ref> [3] </ref>. Using a pronunciation dictionary derived from the ONOMASTICA data, 60.0% names correct were achieved on the test set of the 1337 spoken last names. Compared to the spontaneous scheduling task, the loss of performance can be explained by several factors.

Reference-contexts: However, in the MS-TDNN, the DTW is directly integrated in the connectionist architecture and training scheme, allowing for discriminant training on the word and sentence level <ref> [4] </ref>. Without using any language modeling, the speaker-independent recognition rate of continuously spelled letter sequences is about 90% letter accuracy.
