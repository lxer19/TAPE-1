Reference-contexts: To perform an operation on each single element of a group or to filter a subset of elements from a group fulfilling certain properties (i.e. a predicate) there are operations well known from functional programming <ref> [BW88] </ref>: map: takes an operation o and a set (or group) s and performs o on each element of s 1 filter: takes a predicate p (a function returning a boolean) and a set (or group) s and returns a set s 0 containing those elements x of s, for which

Reference-contexts: In this case, grouping means replacing nodes or edges by a node or edge representing the group (see figure 1). Formally, grouping and related terms are defined as follows. Terms taken from graph theory are defined e.g. in [SS89], <ref> [Har69] </ref>. * A group is a subset of all entities under consideration (including groups them selves). 1 * A grouping is a surjective graph homomorphism, mapping the elements of a group to a single node (or a single edge) representing this group. * If the difference matters, one can distinguish node
