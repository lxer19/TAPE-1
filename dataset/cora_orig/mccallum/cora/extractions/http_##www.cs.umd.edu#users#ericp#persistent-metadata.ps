Abstract: Object-oriented and relational databases typically provide some sort of metadata, such as the documentation and type information for slots or columns. The tool suite described in this paper goes beyond this typical set of services by allowing application programmers and software tool builders of knowledge representation intensive systems (i) to extend this usual set of metadata to allow for other metadata such as unit of measure or relation type, (ii) to associate a non-typical variety of metadata with a slot on a particular instance such as a slot state history or a rating of the slot contents' probability of correctness, (iii ) to allow that these metadata types and their values be dynamically added, deleted and altered, and (iv) to allow this metadata to persist and therefore be available for subsequent sessions. The implementation is based on the Metaobject Protocol (MOP) of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). The MOP allows for the seamless extension of CLOS's object-oriented functionality without alteration of any CLOS source code.
