Abstract: We consider limitations on the performance of computers arising from thermodynamics and the laws of physics. We provide upper bounds on three quantities: sustained information flux, information storage density, and sustained computational speed. All of these upper bounds are "tight" in the sense that they could be approached by plausible-sounding physical systems, and they all arise from a single unified point of view. We also make a conjecture about the rate of inevitable decay of stored information. This conjecture may be thought of as a quantitative extension of the second law of thermodynamics. It leads to a bound on the density of stable information. We carefully elucidate the assumptions behind these bounds. We give a list of 4 open problems at the end.

Reference-contexts: It is quite possible that these assumptions underlying Bekenstein's bound could be justified, I am merely saying that neither he nor his critics [unru82] [unwi82] [page82] <ref> [beke82] </ref> [beke83] [beke88] have ever done so. In the rest of this section, we will pretend that this has been done and we will explore the consequences of Bekenstein's bound, assuming its validity. <p> For example, in the previous numerical example, (1000 Kg inside 1 cubic meter) Bekenstein's bound (assuming the 1-cubic meter region is a sphere) gives I &lt; 1:6 fi 10 46 bits while the bound of answer 2A was I &lt; 6:0 fi 10 34 bits. Indeed, as Bekenstein <ref> [beke82] </ref> argued, his bound implies an upper limit on the number q of kinds of elementary particles there are in the universe. As usual for us, we may let the "kind" of a particle include all the measurable quantum number information about a particle, not just its name.

(And at 6000 Kelvin, no solids exist, at 7000, no liquids exist, and by 10000, no molecules exist.) It is therefore not suprising that by eliminating the material, causing the photons to

The VLSI model in these references isn't quite "right:" * It ignores cooling problems * It ignores length-dependent propagation delay (but see <ref> [chaz85] </ref>) * It ignores the possibility of "cheating" by using more power and more bitrate when you want to transmit more information than usual, or communicating by radio... but, it's close enough to make me suspect that a usable complexity theory could come of this.

For now, the reader will have to be satisfied that the information in our memory will persist, while not forever, at least for some nonzero amount of time. Although nonlinear effects are generally thought of as small at "everyday" energies, they can still have profound effects [zure91b] <ref> [hawk74] </ref>. 20 And even if they did, the emulsion might still need to be so massive that it would collapse under its own gravity. We will continue to assume such gravitational effects are negligible, though.

Reference-contexts: This suggests the use of this expression as a replacement for (7) in the low power limit. In the usual previous work in information theory, where information transmission over "realistic, band-limited" analog channels was considered [shan59] [slep61] <ref> [land62] </ref>, it was found that the amount of information which could be transmitted grew like the logarithm of the available power as power became large, whereas we see from answer 1B that in fact, far more information flux is possible growing like P 3=4 . <p> This bound arises from the n 1 2 (n is the number of photons, is their average phase-angle) uncertainty principle.

Reference-contexts: that our idealization of "boxes" with perfectly hard, rigid, reflecting walls cannot actually exist. (A rigid object would have a speed of sound greater than the speed of light impossible, according to special relativity.) Nevertheless, suitable "boxes" might exist, with some suitably weak sense of the word "box." For instance <ref> [whee57] </ref>, one can imagine "geons" which are blobs of radiation confined by their own gravity. A nickel atom may be thought of as a "box" containing 28 electrons. An (essentially) perfectly reflecting box for low energy microwave photons may be made out of superconductor.

Paul Benioff [beni82a] [beni82b], and later R.P.

By forcibly compressing a large volume of our "emulsion" into a small volume, we could force its "grain size" to be arbitrarily small, although at the cost of delocalizing its particles (due to the zero-point motion arising <p> See x4.7.
