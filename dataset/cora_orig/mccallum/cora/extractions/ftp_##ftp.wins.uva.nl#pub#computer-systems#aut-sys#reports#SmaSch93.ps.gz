Abstract: The trajectory control of a pneumatically driven robot arm resembing a skeletal muscle system is studied. The arm dynamics have been shown to be hysteretic and significantly changing in time due to external influences (Hesselroth et al., IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics, in press) thus requiring an adaptive controller.

Reference-contexts: The rubbertuators have a high force-to-weight ratio and are very compliant, such that the robot is safe for operation in direct contact with human operators. In a previous publication <ref> [1] </ref>, we have investigated a visuo-motor coordination system to control the end-effector positioning of this robot arm. Although accurate positioning is possible, the trajectory of the robot arm which connects one endpoint to another is uncontrolled and oscillatory, and completion takes a relatively long time, i.e., about 30 s.

Reference-contexts: III-180-III-183. 1 For joints 1, 2, and 3, each agonist as well as antagonist actuator consists of a pair of rubbertuators. 2 The robot system The dynamic behaviour of any n degree of freedom robot arm can be described by the equation <ref> [2] </ref> t = M (fi) fi + B (fi) _ fi _ fi + C (fi) _ fi 2 + F (fi; _ fi) + G (fi) (1) where t is an n-vector of torques exerted by the links, and fi, _ fi, fi are n-vectors denoting the positions, velocities, and <p> The robot can be controlled in position control mode or pressure control mode. In position control mode, an internal PID controller <ref> [2] </ref> is used for positioning the joints of the robot. Obviously, this can only give very coarse positioning, and our measurements show that the feedback makes all joints of the arm oscillate with an amplitude of about 1 ffi , never reaching the desired position accurately.

Reference-contexts: Also, the link actuators are usually made so powerful that M , C, F , and G can be considered independent of fi. Thus, eq. (1) is reduced to n independent equations for which simple control methods suffice <ref> [3] </ref>. However, such simplifications cannot be made for the rubbertuator robot arm. The M , B, C, F , and G are now functions of fi, and due to the physical properties of rubber change considerably in time.

Reference-contexts: The neural network is a feed-forward network trained with conjugate gradient optimisation 3 line the realised trajectory. Initially, the trajectory is reasonable followed where velocity is constant; after only 16 trials, the whole trajectory is followed with an average error of 0:1 ffi . with Powell restarts <ref> [6] </ref>. Newly generated samples are continuously added to the bin of available samples, upon which minimisation is performed. 4 Results The system, with no a priori knowledge, is trained on a trajectory sin (t) cos 2 (11t). Initially, the trajectory is only followed very coarsely.
