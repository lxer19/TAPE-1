Abstract: The evolution of solitary waves of the gBBM equation is investigated compu-tationally. The experiments confirm previously derived theoretical stability estimates and, more importantly, yield insights into their behavior. For example, highly energetic unstable solitary waves when perturbed are shown to evolve into several stable solitary waves.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation <ref> [1] </ref> is a model for unidirectional dispersive long waves with finite amplitude. It is a particular case of the generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (gBBM) equation which is known to have solitary-wave solutions.

Reference-contexts: Numerical Approximations. In order to accurately reflect the long-time behavior of instabilities and simulate solutions on the real line, the equation (1.1) is first scaled (in space) from an interval [0; 2500] into <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. The initial value problem (1.1) and (1.2) is then solved on a discrete grid of points belonging to x 2 [0; 2] and t &gt; 0 using periodic boundary conditions. The equation is projected into Fourier space using de-aliased Fourier pseudo-spectral collocation techniques [2]. <p> accurately reflect the long-time behavior of instabilities and simulate solutions on the real line, the equation (1.1) is first scaled (in space) from an interval [0; 2500] into <ref> [0; 2] </ref>.

The time steps between calls to DEABM are fixed in size to enable better control of the dissipation of the scheme. The veracity of the scheme was tested by comparing numerical solutions to exact, stable solutions of the linear and nonlinear dispersive equations.

Reference-contexts: The equation (1.1) was studied in <ref> [4] </ref>, where they analyzed the stability of the 1-parameter family of solitary-wave solutions, which may be written in the form u c (x; t) = fA sech [K (x ct)]g 2=(p1) ; (1.3) 1 Work supported in part by the Office of Scientific Computing, U.S. <p> Office of University and Science Education Programs, and administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education. where c &gt; 1 is the speed and K and A are given by K = p 1 r c (p + 1)(c 1) : (1.4) One of the primary results of <ref> [4] </ref> is that for p &gt; 5, the solitary-wave solution u c is stable for c &gt; c 0 (p), but unstable for c c 0 (p) where c 0 is given in example 3.1 from [4]. <p> r c (p + 1)(c 1) : (1.4) One of the primary results of <ref> [4] </ref> is that for p &gt; 5, the solitary-wave solution u c is stable for c &gt; c 0 (p), but unstable for c c 0 (p) where c 0 is given in example 3.1 from [4]. In particular, we note that c 0 = 1:301 for p = 8 which corresponds to the examples reported on in Section 3 below. 2. Numerical Approximations. <p> The veracity of the scheme was tested by comparing numerical solutions to exact, stable solutions of the linear and nonlinear dispersive equations. Several norms are monitored for accuracy. 3. Numerical Simulations with Unstable Solitary Waves. As stated in Section 1 and proved in <ref> [4] </ref>, the solitary-wave solutions u c of (1.1) are unstable if p &gt; 5 for values of c close enough to, but larger than 1.
