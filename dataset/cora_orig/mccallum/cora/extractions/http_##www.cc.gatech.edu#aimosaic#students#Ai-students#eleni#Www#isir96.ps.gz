Abstract: In this paper, we describe an office logistic robot designed to execute tasks such as collecting and delivering mail, delivering print outs, and collecting waste baskets. Our concern is not so much the development of new methods, since for most of the problems which we had to address we found theoretical solutions in the literature. Rather we are concerned with adapting these solutions to real-world surroundings with little or no modifications of the environment, and combining them into a system which provides a variety of services. In the following sections we describe the system's various components, as well as its overall architecture. We conclude with a discussion of an experiment which demonstrates the performance of our system.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not able to recognize or manipulate any objects. Finally, the system which most closely resembles DAVID in terms of capabilities, is RHINO <ref> (Buhmann et al. 1995) </ref>. RHINO is able to build, through exploration, a map of an office environment, a capability that DAVID lacks, and to navigate reactively in it.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we will compare DAVID's design and capabilities with some of the robots that participated in these competitions until 1995. CARMEL's <ref> (Congdon et al. 1993) </ref> hierarchical architecture is similar to DAVID's, in that, a high-level mission-planning element invokes low-level perception/motion elements and interprets their outcomes. It is able to navigate reactively at high speeds of 300mm/sec, however it does not have vision capabilities and relies on artificial markers to recognize objects.

Reference-contexts: Reactive Motion Planning DAVID is equipped with a reactive-planning method which enables it to avoid collisions with unknown obstacles or even slowly moving objects. This reactive planning method is based on a so-called artificial potential fieldmethod <ref> (Krogh 1984) </ref>. An artificial potential field arises from the superposition of two types of forces: an attractive force which is emitted by the goal location and repellent forces which are emitted by obstacle surfaces and keep the robot from approaching the obstacles.

Reference-contexts: This fairly inexpensive positioning system provides rather accurate ( x;y 5 cm) absolute position data. An Extended Kalman Filter Approach The central unit which combines position information from various sources with varying accuracies and which calculates a final position estimate is an extended Kalman filter such as described in <ref> (Leonard and Durrant-Whyte 1992) </ref>. The primary information sources for the Kalman filter are the position estimates of the robot's odometry system, a polygonal map of the operation area, and the 16 sonar sensors. For a first position estimate the robot uses the position information provided by its odometry system.

Reference-contexts: It is able to navigate reactively at high speeds of 300mm/sec, however it does not have vision capabilities and relies on artificial markers to recognize objects. The scope of the FLAKEY (Saffiotti et al. 1997) and XAVIER <ref> (Nourbakhsh et al. 1993) </ref> projects is much larger than DAVID's. We should mention however, that FLAKEY, due to the inherently parallel nature of fuzzy control, has a more distributed architecture with a quite extended range of capabilities, such as object recognition, people tracking, self localization, navigation and map building.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, XAVIER's Task Control Architecture (TCA) is designed to provide facilities for communication and control between multiple processes running on multiple processors, and that its capabilities include task planning, speech recognition, navigation, a neural-network based object-recognition element, and learning. DERVISH <ref> (Nourbakhsh et al. 1995) </ref> is able to navigate an office environment without using any metric information, relying only on a topological map and sonar perceptual input. However, it is not able to recognize or manipulate any objects.

Reference-contexts: This can be due to incomplete knowledge or to changes in the environment. Accounting for this type of effects requires the motion planner to exhibit not only a deliberative but also a certain reactive behavior. There are various ways to integrate deliberative and reactive planing (see <ref> (Prassler 1996) </ref>, for example). In this work, we have decided to allow different paradigms for goal-oriented motion planning and reactive motion planning, which, however, work in a highly interwoven manner.

Task Modeling DAVID's elementary tasks are modeled in terms of AUTO-GNOSTIC's Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) models.
