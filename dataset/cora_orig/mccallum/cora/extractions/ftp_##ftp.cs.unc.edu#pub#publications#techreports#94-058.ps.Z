Reference-contexts: The VCD process as well as the properties of the noise contained within the image can be studied through statistical pattern recognition. Traditional statistical pattern recognition is performed at the maximum outer scale of the image, where histograms and clustering are analyzed across the entire range of observed pixels <ref> [Duda, 1973] </ref>. A multiscale statistical analysis illuminates elements of the relationship between scale and object shape. By using critical values revealed in the analysis, images may be reconstructed at "natural" boundaries, accounting for the size and shapes of the objects within the image.

Reference-contexts: using the convolution operation, I (x) h (x), where I (x) h (x) = h (t)I (x - t)dt We choose our sampling function with care, specifying a function that is invariant with respect to spatial translation and spatial rotation (i.e. is independent of the value and orientation of x) <ref> [Florack, 1993] </ref>. One such family of 2 functions is the Gaussian (or Normal) distribution and its derivatives.

Reference-contexts: Boundaries and Scale Boundaries of objects of varying size exhibit different responses when measured with differing Gaussian filters (a range of derivative of Gaussian kernels) through changing scale. The Laplacian of the Gaussian, in particular, elicits a medialness response from objects contained within the image with varying scale <ref> [Fritsch, 1993] </ref>. a teardrop shape. The measured signal to noise ratio (SNR) within that image has been constrained to 4 to 1.

Reference-contexts: One such approach toward vision is based upon diffusion as a plausible model of vision. Grossberg describes a model that includes a boundary detection system and a system by which feature values undergo a process of "filling-in" <ref> [Grossberg, 1985] </ref>. The properties of diffusion in such a context of visual processing are particularly well principled, and fit this construction well. In particular, the Gaussian curve and its derivatives are solutions to the heat equation, an equation which governs diffusion behavior.

Reference-contexts: By using critical values revealed in the analysis, images may be reconstructed at "natural" boundaries, accounting for the size and shapes of the objects within the image. This approach begins with an adaptation of traditional measurements of distributions of random variables <ref> [Olkin, 1980] </ref> to a multiscale view of image processing. Sampling and Scale Consider an array of observed values, I (x), where for purposes of discussion the location specified by parameter x is in 1 , but can easily be generalized to n .

Reference-contexts: Using the covariant probability distributions among multiple parameters as a basis for the dissimilarity measures that affect conductance in VCD generates a more robust means for reducing noise while preserving boundary information <ref> [Yoo, 1993] </ref>. While the resulting usersupervised SPR-constrained VCD filtering mechanism provides a principled means of measuring dissimilarity or gradients of possibly incommensurable within-pixel data parameters, there remains the problems associated with the variations of local intensity and the nonstationary nature of intensity and contrast in MR images.
