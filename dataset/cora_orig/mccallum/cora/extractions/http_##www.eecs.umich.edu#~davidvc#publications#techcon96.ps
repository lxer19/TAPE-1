Abstract: Two methods are presented for static timing verification of sequential circuits implemented as a mix of static and domino logic. Constraints for proper operation of domino gates are derived. An important observation is that input signals to domino gates may start changing near the end of the evaluate phase. The first method models domino gates explicitly, similar to latches. The second method treats domino gates only during pre- and post-processing steps. This method is shown to be more conservative, but easier to compute.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction High-performance microprocessors use various circuit techniques to achieve high clock frequencies. Particularly popular is the use of domino logic. This style of dynamic logic, first proposed by Krambeck et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, has the advantage of small area, fast operation, and low power. However the use of domino logic has been restricted mainly to full custom designs, in part because of the difficulty of verification.

Reference-contexts: The characteristic timing constraint for domino gates was stated in Krambecks paper: All nodes can make at most only a single (rising) transition and then must stay there until the next precharge. Most work in static timing analysis of sequential circuits has not considered domino logic. Venkat et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, described timing verification methodology for domino circuits. The focal points of their work is the identification of dynamic nodes, constraint generation for verifying the operation of the dynamic logic gates, and handling gated clocks.
