Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction OSI Application Entities use presentation addresses to address other Application Entities. The model for this is defined in [ISO87b]. Presentation addresses are stored in the OSI Directory using an ASN.1 representation defined by the OSI Directory <ref> [CCI88] </ref>. Logically, a presentation address consists of: * A presentation selector * A session selector * A transport selector * A set of network addresses The selectors are all octet strings, but often have IA5 character representations. The format of network addresses is defined in [ISO87a].

Reference-contexts: Logically, a presentation address consists of: * A presentation selector * A session selector * A transport selector * A set of network addresses The selectors are all octet strings, but often have IA5 character representations. The format of network addresses is defined in <ref> [ISO87a] </ref>. There is a need to represent presentation addresses as strings in a number of different contexts. This Internet Draft defines a format for use on the Internet. It is for display to human users, and its use is recommended whenever this needs to be done. <p> In the NS notation, the concrete binary form of network address is given. Otherwise, this string notation provides a mechanism for representing the Abstract Syntax of a Network Address. This must be encoded according to Addendum 2 of ISO 8348 <ref> [ISO87a] </ref>. 5 Macros There are often common addresses, for which a cleaner representation is desired. This is achieved by use of Macros. If a &lt;network-address&gt; can be parsed as: &lt;otherstring&gt; "=" *( any ) Then the leading string is taken as a Macro, which is substituted.

Reference-contexts: It is for display to human users, and its use is recommended whenever this needs to be done. Typically, this will be for system managers rather than for end users. It is not intended for internal storage. This Internet Draft was originally published as UCL Research Note RN/89/14 <ref> [Kil89] </ref>. It was agreed as a unified syntax for the THORN and ISODE projects. It is used throughout ISODE.
