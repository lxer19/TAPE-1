Abstract: The relationship between geometry (form) and physical behavior (function) dominates many engineering activities. The lack of uniform and rigorous computational models for this relationship has resulted in a plethora of inconsistent (and thus usually incompatible) computer aided design (CAD) tools and systems, causing unreasonable overhead in time, effort, and cost, and limiting the extent to which CAD tools are used in practice. It seems clear that formalization of the relationship between form and function is a prerequisite to taking full advantage of computers in automating design and analysis of engineering systems. We present a unified computational model of physical behavior that explicitly links geometric and physical representations. The proposed approach characterizes physical systems in terms of their algebraic-topological properties: cell complexes, chains, and operations on them.

Reference-contexts: Mathematical models are 5 not unique, and their selection is a delicate and often subjective matter. For example, depending on computational requirements, solids have been defined as r-sets [Req77], manifolds with boundary [Hof89], and as open-regular sets <ref> [Arb90] </ref>. 2 A mathematical model of a physical object must be capable of predicting the behavior of a physical object in a variety of situations (e.g., initial and boundary conditions). Thus, such a model may be viewed as a map from stimuli to responses.

Reference-contexts: In this section we develop computational models of distributions and show how they can be used for modeling geometric and other physical properties. Our discussion is self-contained but relies on notions from point-set and algebraic topology, as well as differential geometry, such as can be found in standard texts <ref> [Mun84, BG80, Bur85, BS90] </ref>. 3.1 Cells and complexes The concept of `distribution of a physical quantity' implies the ability to characterize and hence distinguish the value of quantities in different regions of n-dimensional Euclidean space, E n (n 3 in this paper). <p> Several kinds of cell complexes are useful for physical systems modeling. When all cells are simplices, K is called a simplicial complex. Other types of cells give rise to other types of complexes, such as cubical <ref> [BG80] </ref>, CW [Mun84], geometric [RO90]. Figure 2 shows the first four n-simplices (point, line segment, triangle, and tetrahedron), and first four n-cubes (point, line segment, quadrilateral and 3-cube). <p> See <ref> [BG80] </ref>, p. 199. 11 This algebraic-topological operation defines a (p 1)-chain in terms of a p-chain, and should not be confused with the geometric boundary of a point set. <p> However, this advantage is mitigated somewhat, because it is impossible to either compute or measure continuum distributions. A rigorous development of the relationship between traditional continuum models of physics and models defined by finite chain models is best expressed in terms of the calculus of differential forms <ref> [Ton75, BG80, BS90] </ref>, which is beyond the scope of this paper. But if we assume that space and time are continuous, we may show that a finite chain model of physics is consistent with traditional continuum models in the following common (but somewhat restricted) case.

Reference-contexts: We conclude our (brief and necessarily incomplete) remarks on analysis and simulation by noting that Kron's work also served as a point of departure for Branin <ref> [Bra66] </ref> and Tonti [Ton75], who have advocated (as did Kron [Kro59]) that algebraic topology forms a common and universal basis for classification of physical theories. <p> Annotated geometric models, geometric features, bond graphs, and finite elements | all are important examples of computational tools for analysis and design, yet each by itself is 4 unable to model some important aspect of physical behavior. In this paper, building on work of Branin <ref> [Bra66] </ref> and Tonti [Ton75], we characterize physical systems in terms of their algebraic-topological properties: finite cell complexes, chains, and operations on them. <p> For the reader interested in the structure of physical theories, there are many classical writings in the philosophy of physics (e.g., [Mar77]), as well as an extensive literature describing analogies between various physical domains <ref> [Kro45, Ols43, Pay61, Bra66, Ton75, Fra85] </ref>. Notably, Tonti [Ton75] describes a classification scheme for physical theories in algebraic-topological format, representing them in terms of canonical graphical schema. The main components of these schema are dual 17 quantities (configuration and source), "structural" equations (conservation, balance, etc.), and constitutive or phenomenological equations. <p> It is commonly accepted (e.g., <ref> [Ton75, Bra66, Fra85] </ref>) that most physical laws, and therefore constraints on chain models, fall into two broad categories: 1. Structural laws (conservation, balance, equilibrium), which are based on topological invariants and can be expressed using operations of boundary and coboundary; clearly, these operations constrain incident cells. 2. <p> There is a close relationship between the operators of vector calculus (such as gradient, divergence, curl) and operations of boundary and coboundary <ref> [Bra66, Ton75] </ref>, which is why a variety of other structural constraint elements can be defined in a straightforward fashion. These include compatibility conditions, circuital laws, various versions of Stokes theorem, and so on.

Reference-contexts: The physical behavior is then viewed as being described by integral, partial and/or ordinary differential equations, which must be solved given some initial and/or boundary conditions. The mathematical properties of boundary/initial value problems have been studied extensively (e.g., see <ref> [CH89] </ref>). Of course, such models cannot generally be solved exactly, and require numerical approximations that are often based on discretization and/or approximation of the geometric domain.

Reference-contexts: For example, it is generally recognized that the finite element method is formulated as a means to approximate continuous functions, and not to model or represent physical phenomena <ref> [CME89, ZL89, TO93] </ref>.

The assumption that a given domain can be decomposed into a finitely describable cell complex is common in solid and geometric modeling <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref> to support development of algorithms and to assure the validity of the computed results. Similarly, domain decompositions are crucial to the development of the analysis and simulation tools, such as those based on finite elements, finite differences, network analysis, and so on. <p> This simple machinery is sufficient to define and compute many properties important in solid modeling, such as (geometric) boundary, cyclicity, connectivity. Any solid S is an orientable topological polyhedra <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref>. In other words, S can be defined as a homogeneously 3-dimensional cell complex K. Furthermore, all 3-cells of K can be oriented coherently. <p> This changing mass distribution cannot be arbitrary, because it must satisfy the physical law of conservation of mass, which states that the change in mass in a given region results from flow 6 Additional conditions on 2-cycles are usually imposed; see <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref>. 14 through its boundary. To state the law in terms of chains, we need another chain to represent this flow of mass through the boundary of every 3-cell in K.

Reference-contexts: The continuum formulation (for example, see <ref> [Lov27] </ref>) of elasticity expresses the behavior in terms of four basic quantities: displacement u, strain ~ , force f, and stress . The strain tensor defines the local deformation properties of a body at a point, while the stress tensor represents forces acting through infinitesimal planes passing through a point.

Reference-contexts: Figure 6 illustrates a 2-chain representing a distribution of mass in a body.

At any given time t, the mass distribution in K may be described by the 3-chain M (K).

A common limitation of approaches described in the design research literature is the lack of a complete and explicit model of physical behavior. <p> Figure 12 illustrates such a specification for a simple bracket whose interfaces are the three holes of given diameters, and whose mechanical behavior is defined by specifying the relationship between the applied forces on and the displacements of the holes. While such design specifications are common in literature <ref> [SV89, SG92, MCKP91] </ref>, they are rarely accompanied by formal specification (or computer representation) of their semantics. The formal semantics of such a design specification can be represented in a straightforward fashion using chain models. <p> To be consistent with the requirement that boundary value problems be well posed, it is a common practice to prescribe specific values of either forces or displacement (but not both) at the interfaces <ref> [SG92, MCKP91] </ref> and perhaps put bounds on other physical quantities of interest. Clearly we can impose similar conditions on chain coefficients in Figure 13, but the proposed chain model can be used to specify more general constraints useful in design. <p> As discussed in [SV89], solutions to such design problems are not unique, by the very nature of the synthesis problem. Several different approaches have been described in the literature, and that the holes can be connected by "support regions" whose size is proportional to the applied forces. In <ref> [MCKP91] </ref>, the synthesis is completed by filling all available space surrounding the holes and performing shape optimization. These methods are likely to result in distinctly different bracket designs.

Our discussion is self-contained but relies on notions from point-set and algebraic topology, as well as differential geometry, such as can be found in standard texts <ref> [Mun84, BG80, Bur85, BS90] </ref>. 3.1 Cells and complexes The concept of `distribution of a physical quantity' implies the ability to characterize and hence distinguish the value of quantities in different regions of n-dimensional Euclidean space, E n (n 3 in this paper). <p> A common cell decomposition is the triangulation, which exists for most sets of interest in engineering (e.g., for all semi-analytic sets and for all manifold objects); in this case, all cells c i are (possibly curved) simplices (see <ref> [Mun84] </ref>) of dimension n = 0; 1; 2; 3. Other cell decompositions may be chosen based on the requirements of a given application, as described below. Definition 4 An n-cell c is a set that is homeomorphic 3 to a closed unit n-ball B n . <p> We have defined cells that are (at least implicitly) embedded in space, although we may, on occasion, view cells as abstract combinatorial objects as well. 3 Two sets S 1 and S 2 are homeomorphic if there is a continuous bijection h : S 1 ! S 2 <ref> [Mun84] </ref>. 9 Definition 6 A cell complex K is a set of cells that satisfy the following properties: 1. The boundary of each n-cell c is a finite union of (n 1)-cells in K: @(c) = S 2. <p> Several kinds of cell complexes are useful for physical systems modeling. When all cells are simplices, K is called a simplicial complex. Other types of cells give rise to other types of complexes, such as cubical [BG80], CW <ref> [Mun84] </ref>, geometric [RO90]. Figure 2 shows the first four n-simplices (point, line segment, triangle, and tetrahedron), and first four n-cubes (point, line segment, quadrilateral and 3-cube).

Using this methodology, a physical system is "reticulated" into a bond-graph by systematic "lumping" of spatially distributed physical quantities, so that the system's dynamic behavior (time-frequency response) can be simulated and analyzed. <p> For the reader interested in the structure of physical theories, there are many classical writings in the philosophy of physics (e.g., [Mar77]), as well as an extensive literature describing analogies between various physical domains <ref> [Kro45, Ols43, Pay61, Bra66, Ton75, Fra85] </ref>. Notably, Tonti [Ton75] describes a classification scheme for physical theories in algebraic-topological format, representing them in terms of canonical graphical schema. The main components of these schema are dual 17 quantities (configuration and source), "structural" equations (conservation, balance, etc.), and constitutive or phenomenological equations. <p> This would result in a simple set of linear inequalities, but any testable set of inequalities could be used. In this example, the generalized constitutive relations are static, but they could also specify time-dependent constraints that are similar to those modeled by bond graphs <ref> [Pay61] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Mathematical models are 5 not unique, and their selection is a delicate and often subjective matter. For example, depending on computational requirements, solids have been defined as r-sets <ref> [Req77] </ref>, manifolds with boundary [Hof89], and as open-regular sets [Arb90]. 2 A mathematical model of a physical object must be capable of predicting the behavior of a physical object in a variety of situations (e.g., initial and boundary conditions). <p> Definition 7 A cell complex K is said to decompose a region R if R is equal to the union of the cells of K. The assumption that a given domain can be decomposed into a finitely describable cell complex is common in solid and geometric modeling <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref> to support development of algorithms and to assure the validity of the computed results. Similarly, domain decompositions are crucial to the development of the analysis and simulation tools, such as those based on finite elements, finite differences, network analysis, and so on. <p> This simple machinery is sufficient to define and compute many properties important in solid modeling, such as (geometric) boundary, cyclicity, connectivity. Any solid S is an orientable topological polyhedra <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref>. In other words, S can be defined as a homogeneously 3-dimensional cell complex K. Furthermore, all 3-cells of K can be oriented coherently. <p> This changing mass distribution cannot be arbitrary, because it must satisfy the physical law of conservation of mass, which states that the change in mass in a given region results from flow 6 Additional conditions on 2-cycles are usually imposed; see <ref> [Req77, Hof89] </ref>. 14 through its boundary. To state the law in terms of chains, we need another chain to represent this flow of mass through the boundary of every 3-cell in K.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most perceptible aspect of a physical object is its shape. It is therefore not surprising that geometric modeling is one the most developed disciplines related to modeling physical objects. In fact, until recently <ref> [RV81] </ref> the solid models were viewed as the models of physical objects. Increasingly, it is argued that physical objects may be also modeled as more general point sets [Wei86, RO90, GCP90]. <p> In what follows, we attempt to systematically investigate mathematical models and computer representations of physical behaviors and systems, which we hope will lead to rigorous formulation of many computational problems in engineering design and analysis. Our initial approach is analogous to the modeling paradigm that Requicha and Voelcker <ref> [RV81] </ref> employed to develop mathematical models and representations of (geometric) solid objects. Figure 1 distinguishes between three classes of objects. Physical objects and systems are the "real things" that we are trying to model on a computer.

Reference-contexts: Geometric models support a variety of spatial computations (such as rendering, interference detection, and motion planning), as well as computations of certain physical properties that can be reduced to geometric computations in restricted situations (such as inertial properties, assuming homogeneous distribution of material <ref> [RV82] </ref>). They can also be used to compute the discrete data (for example, finite element meshes) needed by various numerical methods to find approximate solutions to boundary/initial value problems. However, geometric models do not explicitly represent more general physical quantities, such as heat, stresses, or magnetic flux. <p> From the lessons learned in geometric modeling <ref> [RV82] </ref>, it seems clear that the desired advances in computer analysis and synthesis of physical systems can be achieved only when appropriate mathematical models of physical behavior are identified, so that formal properties of various computer representations can be studied.

Clearly we can impose similar conditions on chain coefficients in Figure 13, but the proposed chain model can be used to specify more general constraints useful in design.

Reference-contexts: Given the primary role geometry plays in representing physical objects, it seems clear that all other information must somehow be "attached" to the geometric model. Thus, (representations of) geometric entities are often grouped together to form a "geometric feature." Numerous definitions and uses of features have been put forward <ref> [Sha91a] </ref>, and many challenging technical problems remain [DLH90]. Features are intended to capture and represent engineering "knowledge" and "function," but there are currently no agreed means for doing so.

Reference-contexts: Bond graphs have been proposed as a universal language for engineering, but they do not represent geometric information (which has been abstracted into a small number of real numbers <ref> [SV89] </ref>), and are thus not informationally complete. 1 Because the mathematical model itself and the process of discretization are not explicitly represented on a computer, the current state of the art in analysis and simulation of physical processes comprises painstakingly created special purpose tools. <p> paper, drawing on ideas on Branin and Tonti, we propose a unified formal model of physical behavior that explicitly links geometric and physical representations. 1.3 Design of form from function A restricted, but important, line of research in design concerns the process of "generating geometry" having a desired physical behavior <ref> [SV89] </ref>. <p> Features are intended to capture and represent engineering "knowledge" and "function," but there are currently no agreed means for doing so. Many researchers have attempted to integrate geometric, topological, and physical information for various purposes and with varying degree of success <ref> [SG92, MCKP91, US89, DD88, CA91, SV89] </ref>; a comprehensive survey is outside the scope of this paper, but see [FD89]. A common limitation of approaches described in the design research literature is the lack of a complete and explicit model of physical behavior. <p> The goal of design is then to find an (embedded) cell complex K and a set of chains on K that satisfy these constraints, perhaps in some optimal sense. Below, we use the two-dimensional bracket example from <ref> [SV89] </ref> to show how chain models can be used to formalize the specification of a simple synthesis problem, and how different solutions to this problem might be expressed in terms of the chain model formalism. 5.1.1 Formal functional specification Informally, the functionality of a bracket is usually described by specifying how <p> Figure 12 illustrates such a specification for a simple bracket whose interfaces are the three holes of given diameters, and whose mechanical behavior is defined by specifying the relationship between the applied forces on and the displacements of the holes. While such design specifications are common in literature <ref> [SV89, SG92, MCKP91] </ref>, they are rarely accompanied by formal specification (or computer representation) of their semantics. The formal semantics of such a design specification can be represented in a straightforward fashion using chain models. <p> If the physical elements used to define the chain model represent the behavior of some particular material, the chain model will both satisfy the design specification and have a physical realization. As discussed in <ref> [SV89] </ref>, solutions to such design problems are not unique, by the very nature of the synthesis problem. Several different approaches have been described in the literature, and that the holes can be connected by "support regions" whose size is proportional to the applied forces.

Reference-contexts: We conclude our (brief and necessarily incomplete) remarks on analysis and simulation by noting that Kron's work also served as a point of departure for Branin [Bra66] and Tonti <ref> [Ton75] </ref>, who have advocated (as did Kron [Kro59]) that algebraic topology forms a common and universal basis for classification of physical theories. <p> Annotated geometric models, geometric features, bond graphs, and finite elements | all are important examples of computational tools for analysis and design, yet each by itself is 4 unable to model some important aspect of physical behavior. In this paper, building on work of Branin [Bra66] and Tonti <ref> [Ton75] </ref>, we characterize physical systems in terms of their algebraic-topological properties: finite cell complexes, chains, and operations on them. <p> However, this advantage is mitigated somewhat, because it is impossible to either compute or measure continuum distributions. A rigorous development of the relationship between traditional continuum models of physics and models defined by finite chain models is best expressed in terms of the calculus of differential forms <ref> [Ton75, BG80, BS90] </ref>, which is beyond the scope of this paper. But if we assume that space and time are continuous, we may show that a finite chain model of physics is consistent with traditional continuum models in the following common (but somewhat restricted) case. <p> For the reader interested in the structure of physical theories, there are many classical writings in the philosophy of physics (e.g., [Mar77]), as well as an extensive literature describing analogies between various physical domains <ref> [Kro45, Ols43, Pay61, Bra66, Ton75, Fra85] </ref>. Notably, Tonti [Ton75] describes a classification scheme for physical theories in algebraic-topological format, representing them in terms of canonical graphical schema. The main components of these schema are dual 17 quantities (configuration and source), "structural" equations (conservation, balance, etc.), and constitutive or phenomenological equations. <p> For the reader interested in the structure of physical theories, there are many classical writings in the philosophy of physics (e.g., [Mar77]), as well as an extensive literature describing analogies between various physical domains [Kro45, Ols43, Pay61, Bra66, Ton75, Fra85].

Structural laws (conservation, balance, equilibrium), which are based on topological invariants and can be expressed using operations of boundary and coboundary; clearly, these operations constrain incident cells. 2. <p> There is a close relationship between the operators of vector calculus (such as gradient, divergence, curl) and operations of boundary and coboundary <ref> [Bra66, Ton75] </ref>, which is why a variety of other structural constraint elements can be defined in a straightforward fashion. These include compatibility conditions, circuital laws, various versions of Stokes theorem, and so on.
