Abstract: In this paper, we suggest an approach to multi-agent planning that contains heuristic elements. Our method makes use of subgoals, and derived sub-plans, to construct a global plan. Agents solve their individual sub-plans, which are then merged into a global plan. The suggested approach may reduce overall planning time and derives a plan that approximates the optimal global plan that would have been derived by a central planner, given those original subgoals. We consider two different scenarios. The first involves a group of agents with a common goal. The second considers how agents can interleave planning and execution when planning towards a common, though dynamic, goal. The complexity of a planning process is measured by the time (and space) consumed. Let b be the branching factor of the planning problem (the average number of new states that can be generated from a given state by applying a single operator), and let d denote the depth of the problem (the optimal path from the initial state to the goal state). The time complexity of the planning problem is then O(b d ) (Korf 1987). However, if the global goal can be decomposed into n subgoals (fg 1 ; : : : ; g n g) the time complexity may be reduced significantly. Let b i and d i denote respectively the branching factor and depth of the optimal plan that achieves g i . Then, as shown by Korf in (Korf 1987), if the subgoals are independent or serializable, 1 fl This research has been partially supported by the Is-raeli Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant 032-8284).

Reference-contexts: Proof: The formal proofs of all theorems in this paper appear in <ref> (Ephrati 1993) </ref>. Construction of the Global Plan The multi-agent plan is constructed throughout the process (Step 3 of the algorithm). At this step, all the optimal sequences of operators are determined. We require that the actual plan be constructed dynamically in order to determine the g value of each alternative.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea there is to try and make a global plan by repeatedly merging complete plans that achieve the separate subgoals and answer several restrictions. In our approach, there are no prior restrictions, the global plan is created incrementally, and agents do the merging in parallel. In <ref> (Foulser, Li, & Yang 1992) </ref> it is shown how to handle positive interactions efficiently among different parts of a given plan. The merging process looks for redundant operators (as opposed to aggregating propositions) within the same grounded linear plan in a dynamic fashion.

Reference-contexts: An underestimated heuristic evaluation is also desirable, since it will make the entire A fl search admissible, meaning that once a path to the global goal has been found, it is guaranteed to be the optimal one. However, due to overlapping constraints ("favor relations" <ref> (Martial 1990) </ref>, or "positive" interactions) the global heuristic evaluation might sometimes be an overestimate. Therefore, the A fl search for the optimal path would (in those cases) have to continue until the potential effect of misjudgment in the global heuristic evaluation fades away.

Reference-contexts: Given the set of sub-plans, we are looking for a method to inexpensively merge them into an optimal global plan. To do so we employ an iterative search. The underlying idea is the dynamic generation of alternatives 2 Using SNLP <ref> (McAllester & Rosenblitt 1991) </ref> terminology, these are the propositions in the causal links that construct the "nonlinear abstraction" of p i , partially ordered according to their safety conditions, and stated as prerequisites (preconditions in UCPOP's terminology (Penberthy & Weld 1992)) (e.g., if step w has prerequisite On (x; B) and

Reference-contexts: Note that the essential search method is similar to the search employed by progressive world-state planners. In general, the search through the space of states is inferior to the search, as conducted by POCL planners, through the space of plans <ref> (Minton, Bresina, & Drummond 1991) </ref>. The reason is that any (nondeterministic) choice of action within the first method also enforces the timing of that action (and thus, a greater breadth of search is needed to ensure completeness, e.g., in the Sussman anomaly).

Reference-contexts: The optimality of the procedure is dependent on several heuristic aspects, but in general increased effort on the part of the planners can result in superior global plans. An approach similar to our own is taken in <ref> (Nau, Yang, & Hendler 1990) </ref> to find an optimal plan. It is shown there how planning for multiple goals can be done by first generating several plans for each subgoal and then merging these plans.

Reference-contexts: Planning in each region is done separately, but an important part of the planning process within a region is the updating of its overlapping regions (while the planning process freezes). Our planning framework also relates to the approach suggested in <ref> (Wellman 1987) </ref>. There too the planning process is viewed as the process of incremental constraint posting.
