Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the volume, aspect ratio, angular resolution, edge-separation, and bit-requirement of crossing-free straight-line 3D drawings. We assume the vertex resolution rule, which requires minimum unit distance between any two vertices. Our main result shows that an N -vertex graph colorable with O(1) colors admits a crossing-free straight-line 3D drawing with O(N p
