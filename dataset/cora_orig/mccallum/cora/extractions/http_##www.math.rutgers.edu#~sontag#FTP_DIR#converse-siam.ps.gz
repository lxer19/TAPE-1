Abstract: This paper presents a Converse Lyapunov Function Theorem motivated by robust control analysis and design. Our result is based upon, but generalizes, various aspects of well-known classical theorems. In a unified and natural manner, it (1) allows arbitrary bounded time-varying parameters in the system description, (2) deals with global asymptotic stability, (3) results in smooth (infinitely differentiable) Lyapunov functions, and (4) applies to stability with respect to not necessarily compact invariant sets. 1. Introduction. This work is motivated by problems of robust nonlinear stabilization. One of our main

Reference-contexts: In the particular case in which the set D consists of just one point, the above definition reduces to the standard notion of set asymptotic stability of differential equations. (Note, however, that this definition differs from those in <ref> [3] </ref>, and [30], which are not global.) If, in addition, A consists of just an equilibrium point x 0 , this is the usual notion of global asymptotic stability for the solution x (t) x 0 . Remark 2.3. <p> As explained earlier, our proof is modeled along the lines of that paper. See also the textbooks [31] and [12] for many of these classical results. Nondifferentiable Lyapunov functions have been studied in many papers and textbooks. Among these we may mention the classic book <ref> [3] </ref> by Bhatia and Szego, as well as Zubov's work (see for instance [32]) which study in detail continuous Lyapunov function characterizations for global asymptotic stability with respect to arbitrary closed invariant sets.

Finally, the effect of parameter uncertainty, and the study of associated Lyapunov functions, are topics of interest in robust control theory.

Reference-contexts: After this, Section 5 establishes some basic facts about complete systems needed for the main result. Section 6 contains the proof of the main result for the general case. Our proof is based upon, and follows to a great extent the outline of, the one given by Wilson in <ref> [30] </ref>, who provided in the late 1960s a converse Lyapunov function theorem for local asymptotic stability with respect to closed sets. <p> several technical issues appear in that case; moreover, and most importantly, we have to deal with parameters, which makes the careful analysis of uniform bounds of paramount importance. (In addition, even for the case of no parameters and local stability, several critical steps in the proof are only sketched in <ref> [30] </ref>, especially those concerning Lipschitz properties and smoothness around the attracting set; thus it seems useful to have an expository detailed and self-contained proof in the literature.)

A needed technical result on smoothing functions, based closely also on [30], is placed in an Appendix for convenience. Section 7 deals with the compact case, essentially by reparameterization of trajectories. An example, motivated by related work of Tsinias and Kalouptsidis, is given in Section 8 to show that the analogous theorems are false for unbounded parameters. <p> In the particular case in which the set D consists of just one point, the above definition reduces to the standard notion of set asymptotic stability of differential equations. (Note, however, that this definition differs from those in [3], and <ref> [30] </ref>, which are not global.) If, in addition, A consists of just an equilibrium point x 0 , this is the usual notion of global asymptotic stability for the solution x (t) x 0 . Remark 2.3. <p> We do so because lack of regularity is not an issue in the main applications in which we are interested. Of course, the proofs become much simpler under regularity assumptions.) In the late 1960s, Wilson, in <ref> [30] </ref>, extended the Massera and Kurzweil results to a converse Lyapunov function theorem for local asymptotic stability with respect to closed sets. As explained earlier, our proof is modeled along the lines of that paper. See also the textbooks [31] and [12] for many of these classical results.

Nondifferentiable Lyapunov functions have been studied in many papers and textbooks. <p> In [12] and <ref> [31] </ref>, one can find such studies, and relationships to the special case of _x = f (x) + d (t), with results proved regarding stability under integrable perturbations (not arbitrary bounded ones).

Reference-contexts: See also the textbooks [31] and [12] for many of these classical results. Nondifferentiable Lyapunov functions have been studied in many papers and textbooks. Among these we may mention the classic book [3] by Bhatia and Szego, as well as Zubov's work (see for instance <ref> [32] </ref>) which study in detail continuous Lyapunov function characterizations for global asymptotic stability with respect to arbitrary closed invariant sets. <p> Under suitable technical conditions, systems with time varying parameters can also be treated as general dynamical systems, or general control systems, as in <ref> [23, 32, 22, 10, 11] </ref>. In these works, systems were defined in terms of set-valued maps associated with reachable sets (or attainable sets). A similar treatment was also adopted in [28] and related work, where the prolongation sets of reachable sets were used to study stability.
