Abstract: A full graph on n vertices, as defined by Fulkerson, is a representation of the intersection and containment relations among a system of n sets. It has an undirected edge between vertices representing intersecting sets, and a directed edge from a to b if the corresponding set A contains B. Kleitman, Lasaga and Cowen gave a unified argument to show that asymptotically, almost all full graphs can be obtained by taking an arbitrary undirected graph in the n vertices, distinguishing a clique in this graph which need not be maximal, and then adding directed edges going out from each vertex in the clique to all vertices to which there is not already an existing undirected edge. Call graphs of this type members of the dominant class. This paper obtains the first upper and lower bounds on how large n has to be, so that the asymptotic behavior is indeed observed. It is shown that when n &gt; 170, the dominant class predominates, while when n &lt; 17, the full graphs in the dominant class comprise less than half of the total number of realizable full graphs on n vertices.

A more recent paper of Erne and Stege <ref> [1] </ref> counts exactly the number of legal partial orders on n vertices, for n 14. What is interesting, is that the asymptotic behavior proved by Kleitman and Rothschild is not yet in evidence for n this small.

Reference-contexts: We raise as a question of possible interest: what is the analogous statement for partial orders? 2 Background A full graph (as introduced by Fulkerson and Gross <ref> [2] </ref>) represents both the containment and intersection properties of a collection of sets. Each set is represented by a vertex, and the vertex which represents set A has directed arcs which point at the vertices corresponding to sets that A contains. Undirected arcs link vertices whose sets have non-empty intersections.

In fact, [3] showed that the class of graphs that predominates among full graphs, for sufficiently large n, corresponds to pairs of graphs (U; C), where U is an undirected graph on n vertices, and C is a clique on some k of these vertices which is a subgraph of U . <p> Since this paper is concerned with getting bounds on the asymptotic region, we ask: how large must n be before the dominant class predominates? In this paper, we achieve upper and lower bounds on n, namely 170 and 17. The upper bound is obtained by refining the method of <ref> [3] </ref>. Like the previous paper, our construction partitions full graphs into a fixed number of classes, where it is shown that the number of full graphs in each class grows asymptotically slower than the dominant class. <p> not contained in k); and j is the largest index for which v contains j, or if v does not contain 1, 0 if v intersects 1, and j if j is the largest index of a vertex disjoint from v. 3 3.2 The Construction Our first class (as in <ref> [3] </ref>) is full graphs containing a directed path of six vertices or more. There are 49 legal ways to connect a single vertex to a directed path of six vertices.

Reference-contexts: We conjecture that the lower bound is closer to the exact value. Another open problem is to look at the same question as we did for Full graphs in this paper, for partial orders.
