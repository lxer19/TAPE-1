Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 138 March 1997 (revised July 1997) ISSN 1100-0686 Abstract We improve upon a number of recent undecidability results related to the so-called Herbrand Skeleton Problem, the Simultaneous Rigid E-Unification Problem and the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality.

Reference-contexts: Remark We can also note that one constant suffices. One can easily simulate any number of constants with one constant and a binary function symbol. 5.5 Undecidability Proofs of SREU The first proof of the udecidability of SREU [14] was by reduction of the monadic semi-unification <ref> [1] </ref> to SREU. This proof was followed by two alternative (more transparent) proofs by the same authors, first by reducing second order unification to SREU [13, 17], and then by reducing Hilbert's tenth problem to SREU [16]. The undecidability of second order unification was proved by Goldfarb [24].

Reference-contexts: We will assume that the reader is familiar with basic notions regarding ground term rewrite systems [18]. We will only use very elementary properties. In particular, in the next section we will use Bir-choff's completeness theorem for equational logic <ref> [2] </ref>. In the case of ground equations it states simply that, given a ground set of equations E and and a ground equation s t, E j= s t iff s can be reduced to t by using the equations in E as rewrite rules in both directions.

Reference-contexts: The statement follows now by Theorem 8. fi 7 Relations to Intuitionistic Logic The decision problems in intuitionistic logic have not been as thoroughly studied as the corresponding problems in classical logic <ref> [3] </ref>. In particular, new results about the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic (i.e., closed prenex formulas that are intuitionistically provable), have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov [16, 17, 15] and Voronkov [44]. Some of these results are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 8 we describe the current status of SREU and related results and list some open problems. 2 Preliminaries We will first establish some notation and terminology. We follow Chang and Keisler <ref> [4] </ref> regarding first order languages and structures. For the purposes of this paper it is enough to assume that the first order languages that we are dealing with are languages with equality and contain only function symbols and constants, so we will assume that from here on.

Reference-contexts: Many related results are already mentioned above. The first decidability proof of rigid E-unification is given in Gallier, Narendran, Plaisted and Snyder [21]. Recently a simpler proof, without computational complexity considerations, has been given by de Kogel <ref> [7] </ref>. We start with the solved cases: * Rigid E-unification with ground left-hand side is NP-complete [30]. Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unifiers [20, 21]. * Rigid E-unification with one variable is P-complete [9].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, SREU restricted to rigid equations that either contain one variable, or have a ground left-hand side and a right-hand side that is an equality between two variables, is decidable <ref> [8] </ref>. Note also that SREU is decidable when there are no variables. Actually, the problem is then P-complete because the uniform word problem for ground equations is P-complete [29]. The unsolved cases are: * Decidability of monadic SREU [26]. * Decidability of SREU with two rigid equations.

Reference-contexts: One implication is that the provability problem for the 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. Another important fact is that two variables are necessary to get undecidability. If there is only one variable then SREU is decidable <ref> [9] </ref>. Remark We can also note that one constant suffices. One can easily simulate any number of constants with one constant and a binary function symbol. 5.5 Undecidability Proofs of SREU The first proof of the udecidability of SREU [14] was by reduction of the monadic semi-unification [1] to SREU. <p> The signature has two symbols: one constant and one binary function symbol. 2. The only connectives are ^ and at most three )'s. 3. The antecedents of all implications are closed. 4. The antecedents of implications may be fixed. If there is only one variable then SREU is decidable <ref> [9] </ref>. It follows also that the 6. 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable [9]. 7.1 Proof Search in LJ Proof search in intuitionistic logic with equality is closely connected with SREU, and, unlike in the classical case, the handling of SREU is in fact unavoidable <p> The antecedents of all implications are closed. 4. The antecedents of implications may be fixed. If there is only one variable then SREU is decidable <ref> [9] </ref>. It follows also that the 6. 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable [9]. 7.1 Proof Search in LJ Proof search in intuitionistic logic with equality is closely connected with SREU, and, unlike in the classical case, the handling of SREU is in fact unavoidable in that context [43, 44]. Voronkov considers a particular sequent calculus based proof system LJ [43]. <p> We start with the solved cases: * Rigid E-unification with ground left-hand side is NP-complete [30]. Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unifiers [20, 21]. * Rigid E-unification with one variable is P-complete <ref> [9] </ref>. Or, more generally, SREU with one variable and a bounded number of rigid equations is P-complete [9]. * If all function symbols have arity 1 (the monadic case) then it follows that SREU is PSPACE-hard [25]. <p> Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unifiers [20, 21]. * Rigid E-unification with one variable is P-complete <ref> [9] </ref>. Or, more generally, SREU with one variable and a bounded number of rigid equations is P-complete [9]. * If all function symbols have arity 1 (the monadic case) then it follows that SREU is PSPACE-hard [25]. If only one unary function symbol is allowed then the problem is decidable [11, 12]. <p> Moreover, SREU is undecidable under the following restrictions: The left-hand sides of the rigid equations are ground [36]. Furthermore, there are only two variables [40, 41] and three rigid equations with fixed ground left-hand sides. 30 * SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete <ref> [9] </ref>. Moreover, SREU restricted to rigid equations that either contain one variable, or have a ground left-hand side and a right-hand side that is an equality between two variables, is decidable [8]. Note also that SREU is decidable when there are no variables.

Reference-contexts: The decidability of monadic SREU is currently one of the problems related to SREU that is still open [26]. An effectively equivalent problem is the decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality with unary function symbols <ref> [15] </ref>. Some evidence speaks in favour of that the problem is decidable although with very high computational complexity (e.g., many subcases are decidable, see Section 8). <p> In particular, new results about the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic (i.e., closed prenex formulas that are intuitionistically provable), have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [16, 17, 15] </ref> and Voronkov [44]. Some of these results are: 1. Decidability, and in particular PSPACE-completeness, of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic without equality [15]. 2.

Reference-contexts: We will assume that the reader is familiar with basic notions regarding ground term rewrite systems <ref> [18] </ref>. We will only use very elementary properties. In particular, in the next section we will use Bir-choff's completeness theorem for equational logic [2]. <p> In Section 5 we will use the following property of canonical (or convergent) rewrite systems (cf <ref> [18, Section 2.4] </ref>). Let R be a ground and canonical rewrite system.

Reference-contexts: Finite Tree Automata Finite tree automata, or simply tree automata from here on, are a generalization of classical automata. Tree automata were introduced, independently, in Doner <ref> [19] </ref> and Thatcher and Wright [39]. The main motivation was to obtain decidability results for the weak monadic second-order logic of the binary tree. Here we adopt the following definition of tree automata, based on rewrite rules [5, 6].

Reference-contexts: Question: Is the multiplicity of ' bounded by m ? 1 We refer the reader to [10] for a detailed discussion of the problem. It is important to us here that the Herbrand Skeleton Problem is intimately related to the Existential Intuitionistic Problem and the Simultaneous Rigid E-Unification Problem <ref> [22] </ref>. The first of these problems is easy to formulate: The Existential Intuitionistic Problem Instance: An existential formula 9~x'(~x). Question: Is the formula provable in intuitionistic logic? The second requires auxiliary definitions.

Reference-contexts: Before we prove the theorem we state the following simple lemma. This lemma follows from the wellknown fact that all regular sets of strings are recognizable (cf <ref> [23] </ref>), assuming an appropriate representation of strings. 3 For any string v, we write v r for v in reverse and for a set of strings V we let V r = f v r j v 2 V g.

Reference-contexts: A similar technique was used already by Goldfarb in the proof of the undecidability of second-order unification <ref> [24] </ref>, which is by reduction of Hilbert's tenth problem, and later, adopted from that proof, also in a proof of the undecidability of SREU by Degtyarev and Voronkov [16], which is also by reduction of Hilbert's tenth problem. <p> This proof was followed by two alternative (more transparent) proofs by the same authors, first by reducing second order unification to SREU [13, 17], and then by reducing Hilbert's tenth problem to SREU [16]. The undecidability of second order unification was proved by Goldfarb <ref> [24] </ref>. Reduction of second order unification to SREU is very simple, showing how close these problem are to each other. Plaisted took the Post's Correspondence Problem and reduced it to SREU [36]. From his proof follows that SREU is undecidable already with ground left-hand sides.

Reference-contexts: In particular, for every m, the monadic (all function symbols are of arity 1) SREU reduces to the monadic Herbrand m-Skeleton problem; this reduction is of interest because the decidability of monadic SREU is an open problem <ref> [26] </ref>. In Section 5, we improve upon a construction in Veanes [41] and show the undecidability of a fragment of SREU with only two variables and three rigid equations with ground left-hand sides. <p> The decidability of monadic SREU is currently one of the problems related to SREU that is still open <ref> [26] </ref>. An effectively equivalent problem is the decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality with unary function symbols [15]. Some evidence speaks in favour of that the problem is decidable although with very high computational complexity (e.g., many subcases are decidable, see Section 8). <p> at least two constants. * About the monadic case it is known that if there are more than 1 unary function symbols then SREU is decidable iff it is decidable with just 2 unary function symbols [12]. * If the left-hand sides are ground then the monadic case is decidable <ref> [26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Several false decidabil-ity claims have been published until finally it has been proved undecidable by Degtyarev and Voronkov [12, 14, 16, 17]. Later Plaisted has shown that the fragment of the SREU problem with ground left-hand sides is undecidable <ref> [36] </ref> (the left-hand side of a rigid equation E ` 8 e is E). It is easy to see that SREU is essentially a special case of the Herbrand skeleton problem with Horn formulas and multiplicity one. <p> Corollary 9 (Voda and Komara [42]) tells us that there is no m for which we could effectively decide when to stop our search for such terms in case they do not exist. By using the fact that SREU is undecidable already with ground left-hand sides <ref> [36] </ref>, (i.e., variables occur only in positive literals in the corresponding Horn formulas) and two variables [40, 41] we obtain a sharper version of the above corollary: 13 Corollary 10 For all n 1, n-Skeleton problem of guarded Horn formulas is undecidable already if there are 2n variables and all variables <p> We then use this result to improve the undecidability result of the n-Skeleton problem. The main idea behind our proof is based on a technique that was used by Plaisted <ref> [36] </ref> in a similar context, who called the technique shifted pairing. The idea is to express repetition explicitly by a sequence of strings (like IDs of a TM). <p> As we shall see, the construction of the rigid equation S 0 follows easily from the Train Theorem and some basic properties of tree automata. We believe that this theorem is of independent interest. For example, several theorems that are used in a similar context in Plaisted <ref> [36, Theorems 8.2-8.11] </ref>, can be stated as corollaries of Theorem 13. Before we prove the theorem we state the following simple lemma. <p> It follows easily that solves S M (x; y). fi 25 The shifted pairing technique that is used in Theorem 18 is illustrated in of Theorem 18, because all the constructions in it are effective. Furthermore, the following result due to Plaisted <ref> [36] </ref> (that we used to prove Corollary 10). is an immediate consequence. Corollary 21 (Plaisted) SREU is undecidable even if the left-hand sides are ground. Furthermore, we can sharpen this result as follows. <p> The undecidability of second order unification was proved by Goldfarb [24]. Reduction of second order unification to SREU is very simple, showing how close these problem are to each other. Plaisted took the Post's Correspondence Problem and reduced it to SREU <ref> [36] </ref>. From his proof follows that SREU is undecidable already with ground left-hand sides. <p> Moreover, SREU is undecidable under the following restrictions: The left-hand sides of the rigid equations are ground <ref> [36] </ref>. Furthermore, there are only two variables [40, 41] and three rigid equations with fixed ground left-hand sides. 30 * SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete [9].

Reference-contexts: In particular, for every m, the monadic (all function symbols are of arity 1) SREU reduces to the monadic Herbrand m-Skeleton problem; this reduction is of interest because the decidability of monadic SREU is an open problem [26]. In Section 5, we improve upon a construction in Veanes <ref> [41] </ref> and show the undecidability of a fragment of SREU with only two variables and three rigid equations with ground left-hand sides. <p> Under certain restrictions on the language and the structure of formulas, the 1-Skeleton problem becomes decidable. It is known, however, that it is already undecidable in the presence of one binary function symbol (in addition to constants); moreover, two variables suffice for undecidability <ref> [41] </ref>. For a summary over what is known to be decidable or undecidable under various restrictions see Section 8. <p> By using the fact that SREU is undecidable already with ground left-hand sides [36], (i.e., variables occur only in positive literals in the corresponding Horn formulas) and two variables <ref> [40, 41] </ref> we obtain a sharper version of the above corollary: 13 Corollary 10 For all n 1, n-Skeleton problem of guarded Horn formulas is undecidable already if there are 2n variables and all variables occur in positive literals. <p> In fact, we give a uniform representation of all the recursively enumerable sets by using just three rigid equations with these properties. As a corollary we get that the undecidability of SREU holds already in very restricted cases. We generalize the construction in Veanes <ref> [41] </ref> and improve the lower bound on the number of rigid equations from four to three by using finite tree automata techniques. We then use this result to improve the undecidability result of the n-Skeleton problem. <p> From his proof follows that SREU is undecidable already with ground left-hand sides. Veanes improves the construction of Plaisted by using the membership problem for Turing machines and shows that two variables and one binary function symbol is enough to obtain undecidability <ref> [40, 41] </ref>. 6 Minimal Undecidable Case of the n-Skeleton Problem Let ' M v (x; y) stand for the following formula: ' M 26 ( 1 ) x y) ^ Let ' M (z; x; y) stand for the formula ' M v (x; y) with the term t v replaced <p> Moreover, SREU is undecidable under the following restrictions: The left-hand sides of the rigid equations are ground [36]. Furthermore, there are only two variables <ref> [40, 41] </ref> and three rigid equations with fixed ground left-hand sides. 30 * SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete [9].

Reference-contexts: Thus the undecidability result of Degtyarev and Voronkov implies that the 1-Skeleton problem is undecidable. Voda and Komara have proved that, for each fixed m, the m-Skeleton problem is undecidable <ref> [42] </ref>. One important conclusion for automated theorem proving, drawn in [42], is that there is no m for which there exists an effective decision procedure that 2 would tell us whether m substitutions suffice to establish the provability of a given quantifier free formula. <p> Thus the undecidability result of Degtyarev and Voronkov implies that the 1-Skeleton problem is undecidable.

One important conclusion for automated theorem proving, drawn in [42], is that there is no m for which there exists an effective decision procedure that 2 would tell us whether m substitutions suffice to establish the provability of a given quantifier free formula. <p> Roughly, this involves a search for terms, for a given bound m on multiplicity. Corollary 9 (Voda and Komara <ref> [42] </ref>) tells us that there is no m for which we could effectively decide when to stop our search for such terms in case they do not exist.

Reference-contexts: In particular, new results about the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic (i.e., closed prenex formulas that are intuitionistically provable), have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov [16, 17, 15] and Voronkov <ref> [44] </ref>. Some of these results are: 1. Decidability, and in particular PSPACE-completeness, of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic without equality [15]. 2. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete [15]. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [35]. 3. <p> In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. There are close connections between intuitionistic logic with equality and SREU <ref> [44] </ref>. By using the undecidability of SREU, the proof of (4) is straightforward. The undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment is improved in Veanes [40] by showing that the 5. 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. <p> that the 6. 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable [9]. 7.1 Proof Search in LJ Proof search in intuitionistic logic with equality is closely connected with SREU, and, unlike in the classical case, the handling of SREU is in fact unavoidable in that context <ref> [43, 44] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: two suggested by Erik Palmgren in a different but similar context; we use `' for the formal equality sign. '(x) = (c 0 ) x 1) ^ (c 1 ) x 0) The Herbrand theorem plays a fundamental role in automated theorem proving methods known as the rigid variable methods <ref> [45] </ref>. We can identify the following procedure underlying such methods. We call it the principal procedure of rigid variable methods. Let 9~x'(~x) be a closed formula that we wish to prove. Step I Choose a positive integer m. Step II Check if there exists an m-corroborator for '. <p> The unsolved cases are: * Decidability of monadic SREU [26]. * Decidability of SREU with two rigid equations. Both problems are highly non-trivial. Another intriguing open problem is to study the Herbrand f -Skeleton problem. In particular, the following open problem is posed in Voronkov <ref> [45] </ref>: * Does there exist a computable strategy f for which the f -Skeleton problem is decidable?
