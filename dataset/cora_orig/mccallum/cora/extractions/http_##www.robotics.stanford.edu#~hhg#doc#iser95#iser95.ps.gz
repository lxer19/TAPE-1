Abstract: This paper describes an integrated mobile robotic system dubbed the intelligent observer (IO). The IO is a mobile robot which moves through an environment (such as an office building or a factory) while autonomously observing moving targets selected by a human operator. The robot carries one or more cameras which allow it to track objects while at the same time sensing its own location. It interacts with a human user who issues task-level commands, such as indicating a target to track by clicking in a camera image. The user could be located far away from the observer itself, communicating with the robot over a network. As the IO performs its tasks, the system provides real-time visual feedback to the user. We have implemented a prototype of the IO which integrates basic versions of five major components: landmark detection, target tracking, motion planning, motion control, and user interface. We have performed initial experiments using this prototype, which demonstrate the successful integration of these components and the utility of the overall system.

Reference-contexts: Each module is described below. Landmark Detection As the observer moves around in its environment it must keep track of its current position. Our approach to this problem involves placing artificial landmarks throughout the environment. Many researchers have studied the use of landmarks in robot navigation; for examples see <ref> [1, 3, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. In our system, the positions of the landmarks are provided as part of a map which is provided to the IO. Each landmark induces a landmark region such that the landmark is visible to the robot whenever it moves within that region.

Reference-contexts: Each landmark consists of a black square with a 4 fi 4 pattern of smaller squares inside of it. The detection algorithm first identifies edge pixels in the image (using a variant of the algorithm presented in <ref> [2] </ref>), and then looks for edge chains that are consistent with the boundary of a square. When such a chain is found, the corners are detected and then lines are fit to the pixels which make up each edge.

Reference-contexts: In general, target motions may be almost totally unconstrained and the targets themselves may by nonrigid and of unknown shape; humans are a good example. In order to handle such targets, we can apply real-time versions of tracking algorithms such as those described in <ref> [4] </ref>. Currently, however, we use a simplified approach as detailed in Section 3. Motion Planning Traditional motion planning problems involve finding a collision-free path from an initial region I to a goal region G in the presence of obstacles whose geometry is known in advance.
