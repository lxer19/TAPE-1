Title: Changes in Sendmail Version 8*  
Author: Eric Allman 
Address: Mammoth Project  
Affiliation: University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract: Version 8 of sendmail includes a number of major changes from previous versions. This paper gives a very short history of sendmail, a summary of the major differences between version 5 (the last publically available version) and version 8, and some dis cussion of future directions. In 1987, the author stopped major work on sendmail due to other time committments, only to return to active work in 1991. This paper explores why work resumed and what changes have been made. Section 1 gives a short history of sendmail through version 5 and the motivation behind working on version 8. Section 2 has a rather detailed description of what has changed between version 5 and version 8. The paper finishes off with some thoughts about what still needs to be done.
