Abstract: Path planning is studied in a two-dimensional time-varying environment. The environment contains polygonal obstacles that move along known linear trajectories. The path to be found is to connect a given initial position to a final position, while observing a speed bound along the path. The problem of path planning in time-varying environments requires consideration for changes in connectivity of free space over time. An approach is proposed in which the path is found by computing all reachable points in space with earliest access times.

Reference-contexts: Sutner and Maass (1988)'s algorithm to construct the reachable region even for a single polyhedral object in three-dimensional space-time takes O (n 7 ) time. Indeed, it is known that the problem is in general NP-hard <ref> (Canny and Reif 1987) </ref>. Motion planning among moving obstacles is at times considered as a part of the multiple robot coordination problem. Erdmann and Lozano-Perez (1987) represent the motions of the obstacles as a set of slices in space-time. These slices represent configuration spaces at particular times. <p> Indeed, it is known that the problem is in general NP-hard (Canny and Reif 1987).

Reference-contexts: This simplified problem can be solved by applying the method introduced in <ref> (Fujimura and Samet 1993) </ref>. In the following claim, we assume that the start point S coincides with some vertex of the obstacles without loss of generality. Claim 1. <p> The process of finding collision fronts and accessible vertices is an instance of finding the lower envelope of n curve segments with the property that any two curve segments may intersect in at most s points. &gt;From a combinatorics theorem <ref> (Guibas and Sharir 1993) </ref>, we know that the number of segments comprising the lower envelope is O ( s+2 (n)) and the above process runs in O ( s+2 (n) log n) time, where s = 2 in our case and k (n) is the maximum length of an (n; k) <p> In particular, our algorithm for path planning runs in output-sensitive manner. If the obstacles in the environment do not intersect at all, then its running time is the same 16 as the result for path planning amidst obstacles moving without intersection <ref> (Fujimura and Samet 1993) </ref>. Theorem.

Reference-contexts: When the robot is permitted to move at an infinite speed, then the problem can be reduced to the problem of finding a path among stationary obstacles <ref> (Latombe 1991) </ref>. Usually, however, robotic systems are constrained to have some velocity bound. 1 In other words, we allow two obstacles that are initially disjoint to come in contact, overlap each other for a certain period of time, cease to overlap, and finally to move away from each other.

Reference-contexts: Their approach is successful when the topology of the free space does not change (i.e., the configuration space obstacles are not allowed to merge or split as opposed to our approach). Tsubouchi, Naniwa, and Arimoto <ref> (1996) </ref> consider an iterated forecast and planning approach. In this method, the location of each obstacle is obtained in real-time and a robot path is planned among space-time obstacles based on the current motion vectors of the ob 4 stacles. Thus, the robot path is constantly updated with time. <p> In this method, the location of each obstacle is obtained in real-time and a robot path is planned among space-time obstacles based on the current motion vectors of the ob 4 stacles.
