Abstract: This paper describes an implemented computer program called pret that automates the process of system identification: given hypotheses, observations, and specifications, it constructs an ordinary differential equation model of a target system with no other inputs or intervention from its user. The core of the program is a set of traditional system identification (SID) methods. A layer of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques built around this core automates the high-level stages of the identification process that are normally performed by a human expert. The AI layer accomplishes this by selecting and applying appropriate methods from the SID library and performing qualitative, symbolic, algebraic, and geometric reasoning on the user's inputs. For each supported domain (e.g., mechanics), the program uses a few powerful encoded rules (e.g., F = 0) to combine hypotheses into models. A custom logic engine checks models against observations, using a set of encoded domain-independent mathematical rules to infer facts about both, modulo the resolution inherent in the specifications, and then searching for contradictions. The design of the next generation of this program is also described in this paper. In it, discrepancies between sets of facts will be used to guide the removal of unnecessary terms from a model. Power-series techniques will be exploited to synthesize new terms from scratch if the user's hypotheses are inadequate, and sensors and actuators will allow the tool to take an input-output approach to modeling real physical systems.

Reference-contexts: One current thrust of research by this group targets the integration of quantitative and qualitative information [6, 55].

On the spectrum from physics language to mathematics language, QPT resides on the physics end, QSIM on the mathematics end, and pret somewhere in between. Its inputs | primarily observations and hypotheses about the physical system | are partially in the terms of physics.

Reference-contexts: Some of the earliest QR/modeling work [24] builds upon a fixed base of hypotheses, instantiates only those that are appropriate to answer a given query, and chooses between them with a truth maintenance system. The graph-of-models approach <ref> [2] </ref> is similar in many regards to [24], but represents the space of possible models as a directed graph of models where edges between nodes (models) are approximations 8 .

Reference-contexts: These discrepancies are a rich source of information about the process, both preceding and following the failure. They could be used by the other program modules | a form of discrepancy-driven refinement <ref> [3, 53] </ref> | in a variety of ways: to back intelligently out of blind alleys, to avoid duplicating previously performed checks, or to pick up at some appropriate midpoint in the event of a restart.

Reference-contexts: Note that the concepts of loop and point sums are not only appropriate for these examples, but also generalizable well beyond mechanics or electronics. Amsterdam <ref> [4] </ref> uses an energy-based modeling approach that generalizes these notions even further, into effort coordinates and flow coordinates. We have chosen a more-specific semantics in order to make the syntax more comprehensible to the domain experts who will be pret's end users.

The research described in this paper falls most naturally under the general AI rubric, but has strong ties to the system identification branch of control theory as well | in fact, it can accurately be described as an AI-assisted approach to system identification.

These issues have been discussed extensively in the QP literature <ref> [8] </ref> and are reflected in obvious ways throughout pret's code.

Reference-contexts: To test this idea, we have implemented geometric recognition of high-level behavior patterns like chaos, thresholds, oscillations, etc., using computer vision techniques that superimpose a variable-resolution grid over the system's state space, discretize the trajectories into lists of grid squares, and analyze the patterns in those lists <ref> [11] </ref>. This ties in well to the input format of section 2: specifications and observations can be used to set up the geometry of the grid, assuring adequate resolution in the results, attained with the minimum computation.

Reference-contexts: The processing of numeric observations, on the other hand, proceeds at a much lower reasoning level, forcing point-by-point comparisons with numerical integrations of ODEs. We have added a qualitative layer on top of this that uses curve fitting, asymptote recognition, phase-portrait analysis techniques drawn from computer vision <ref> [12] </ref>, etc., to distill high-level descriptive information out of the raw numerical data. This information is then used much as descriptive observation keywords are, greatly raising the level of the reasoning process. The user's sketched graphical observations will undergo exactly the same type of preprocessing and distillation.

Reference-contexts: The ability to rearrange thought primitives in order to solve new problems is a crucial part of what makes a good scientist or engineer | or an intelligent artifact that performs the same tasks. In general, modeling <ref> [24, 38] </ref> underlies most of the approaches to reasoning about physical systems. Strictly speaking, every formalization of the properties of a physical system constitutes a model of the physical system. <p> Multiple hypotheses about a single effect may | and should | exist; the program will automatically determine which one (s) are appropriate. Some other modeling programs, e.g., Forbus and Falkenhainer's compositional modeling <ref> [24] </ref>, define groupings of terms in such situations, such as a set of hypotheses about friction. Mutual exclusivity constraints are then imposed within each group, allowing the program to choose only one of the members, and thereby greatly reducing the complexity of the process. <p> One of the seminal papers in qualitative modeling uses a similar metric <ref> [24] </ref> and gives similar disclaimers about its unsatisfying nature. A more-recent paper [43] defines model simplicity heuristically, terming a model that is "more approximate" or that "uses fewer phenomena" as more simple, but does not suggest how to solve the problem of how many hypotheses are associated with a phenomenon. <p> Section 1.1 presented a broad introduction to AI and QR modeling research; readers of that section may wish to skip the next paragraph.

((minus flowAB -flowAB)) ((d/dt amtB flowAB)) ((d/dt amtA -flowAB)) ((add amtA amtB total)) <p> A simple ODE rule exploits this property to corroborate model and observation symmetries at a purely symbolic level. The QSIM program <ref> [35, 37] </ref> mentioned in section 1.1 performs qualitative simulation of qualitative differential equations (QDEs); given an ODE$QDE translator, currently under development, QSIM could be used to establish qualitative facts about ODE models.

In general, modeling <ref> [24, 38] </ref> underlies most of the approaches to reasoning about physical systems. Strictly speaking, every formalization of the properties of a physical system constitutes a model of the physical system.

Reference-contexts: A controls engineer might perform this task, in its most basic form, by choosing a power series and matching its coefficients against the numerical observations via some sort of regression <ref> [40] </ref>. This paper describes a computer program called pret that automates the system identification process, at several levels, by building an artificial intelligence (AI) layer on top of a set of traditional system identification techniques. <p> Concepts common to this paper and the bulk of the QR/modeling literature include avoidance of unnecessary terms, model refinement driven by failure at a "lower" modeling level, and reasoning that proceeds at as a high level of abstraction as possible. pret solves the same problems as traditional system identification <ref> [40] </ref>, but techniques in the latter tend to be purely mechanical and numerical. [47], for example, does a Volterra-series expansion in the input variable to obtain a set of terms (much like those concocted by the second refiner phase, after the user's hypotheses have been exhausted), then matches coefficients using regression.

Reference-contexts: The subtlety of the reasoning skills involved in this process, together with the intricacy of the interplay between them, has led many of its practitioners to classify modeling as "intuitive" and "an art <ref> [41] </ref>." Any tool that effectively automated a coherent and useful part of this art would be of obvious practical importance in science and engineering: as a corroborator of existing models and designs, as a medium within which to instruct newcomers, and as an intelligent assistant, whose aid allows more time and <p> The two automatic term-synthesis techniques proposed here are derived from power-series expansions. Canonical perturbation theory [31, chapter 11] creates new parameters and Frobenius's method <ref> [41, page 187] </ref> creates new state variables, each via expansion in the appropriate quantity. One can also synthesize new state variables using delay coordinates [32], but doing so would vastly complicate the symbolic algebra that plays such a critical role in pret.

Reference-contexts: One of the seminal papers in qualitative modeling uses a similar metric [24] and gives similar disclaimers about its unsatisfying nature. A more-recent paper <ref> [43] </ref> defines model simplicity heuristically, terming a model that is "more approximate" or that "uses fewer phenomena" as more simple, but does not suggest how to solve the problem of how many hypotheses are associated with a phenomenon. Finally, discrepancy-driven reasoning can aid in the simplification process.

Reference-contexts: A consistency check of a model against a numeric observation proceeds at a much lower | and more expensive | reasoning level than a descriptive observation check. Such an operation typically entails a comparison of a numerical integration of the ODE, performed here with fourth-order Runge-Kutta <ref> [44] </ref>, and a set of point-by-point observations. As mentioned above, this comparison is preceded by a orthogonal distance regression fit of model coefficients to numeric data, performed by the ODRPACK global optimization package.

Reference-contexts: Thus, quantitative observations "drive" the ODE model away from the imprecise, QDE-type end of the spectrum of precision and abstraction and towards the exact, fully specified ODE end. The problem of determining values for the coefficients, known as parameter estimation, is the topic of a rich body of literature <ref> [48] </ref> and the focus of many sophisticated global optimization techniques. We solve it using the ODRPACK package [10], based on orthogonal distance regression and developed at NIST.

Many QR programs, particularly the ones that perform monitoring [23] or diagnosis [20], infer the behavior of a physical system from its structure or vice versa [16].

Reference-contexts: construct an ODE model from this information, pret combines powerful mathematical formalisms, such as the link between the divergence of an ODE and the friction of the system that it describes, with domain-specific notions | such as force balances in mechanical systems | to allow the types of "custom-generated approximations <ref> [53] </ref>" that are lacking in existing AI modeling programs. Two sets of rules, both of which may easily be changed or augmented by the user, play very different roles in the model-building task. <p> These discrepancies are a rich source of information about the process, both preceding and following the failure. They could be used by the other program modules | a form of discrepancy-driven refinement <ref> [3, 53] </ref> | in a variety of ways: to back intelligently out of blind alleys, to avoid duplicating previously performed checks, or to pick up at some appropriate midpoint in the event of a restart. <p> The graph-of-models approach [2] is similar in many regards to [24], but represents the space of possible models as a directed graph of models where edges between nodes (models) are approximations 8 . Another approach <ref> [53] </ref> adapts models to problems using model sensitivity analysis, which formalizes and exploits the effects of parameter changes in the construction of the model. <p> This is an extremely active research area; many good papers by many other groups, as well as many other papers by the cited groups, have appeared in the past five years. The state of the art in this field is particularly well-summarized in a review article by Weld <ref> [53] </ref>, which is also the source of much of the terminology used here.
