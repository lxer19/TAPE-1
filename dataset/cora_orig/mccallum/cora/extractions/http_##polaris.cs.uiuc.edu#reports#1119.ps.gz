Abstract: We present a numerical approach to the simulation of dielectric waveguides that is free of spurious modes and is based on the solution of an eigenvalue problem for the two transverse components of the magnetic field. We introduce a new discretization which has several computational advantages. In particular, by careful design of the discretization procedure we obtain systems of equations for the two components which are equivalent in the sense that a rotation over 90 ffi corresponds to a suitable permutation of indices. The eigenvalue problem is solved iteratively by using an adapted version of the Chebyshev-Arnoldi algorithm. This approach takes full advantage of the sparsity of the matrix and circumvents the large memory requirements and the large computational complexity associated with dense methods. This allows us to employ meshes that are sufficiently fine to resolve higher modes without large discretization errors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Dielectric channel waveguides are widely used for integrated circuit applications, from the microwave to the optical frequency range. For an accurate analysis of general waveguide structures of practical interest, numerical solutions are necessary. As pointed out in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, reliable simulation software should employ formulations which are free of spurious modes, for instance by solving directly the vector Helmholtz equation in terms of the transverse magnetic field components H x and H y . <p> The dielectric permittivity inside each box i is assumed to be a constant * i . We assume a wave dependence of e i (!t+fiz) for the electromagnetic field. To ensure that spurious modes will not be present in the solution <ref> [1, 4] </ref>, the H z component is determined by r H = @ x H x + @ y H y + ifiH z = 0. (1) Here and throughout the paper we use the shorthand notation @ x = @ @x and @ xx = @ 2 integrate the Helmholtz <p> Our first example is a square waveguide. A double-vector Chebyshev-Arnoldi method with a Krylov subspace of dimension m = 24 was used. The dispersion plots in Fig. 3 generally agree with earlier results from <ref> [1, 17, 18] </ref>. For each mode, at low values of the normalized propagation constant B, we present results only for frequencies where there is sufficient decay within the discretized domain. <p> For each mode, at low values of the normalized propagation constant B, we present results only for frequencies where there is sufficient decay within the discretized domain. Insisting on sufficient decay, we do not find the inflection points in the propagation curves for B near 0 that appear in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Our second example is a channel waveguide. The dispersion plot is given in Fig. 5. A single-vector Chebyshev-Arnoldi method with a Krylov subspace of dimension m = 20 was used both for this example and the next one. There is good qualitative agreement with earlier results from <ref> [1, 17, 19] </ref>. <p> Such a large domain is necessary to properly capture the decay in the cladding region of any mode near cutoff. The strip-slab waveguide is our third example. The dispersion plot of the H y 11 mode is shown in Fig. 7 for four different dielectric configurations as given in <ref> [1] </ref>. At low values of the normalized frequency V , the eigenfunctions expand considerably into the region of the cladding where the dielectric permittivity is highest. <p> The solution for sixteen modes at V = 2:76 was obtained in approximately 5 minutes. 5 Conclusion Realistic modeling of dielectric waveguides requires solution of eigenvalue problems that are very large and sparse. The dense solvers used in <ref> [1, 2, 4, 16] </ref> find the complete spectral decomposition at the expense of greatly increased computational complexity and memory requirements, to the extent of prohibiting the solution on realistic grids. Since only the eigenvectors for the propagating modes are desired, projection methods are very suitable for these applications.
