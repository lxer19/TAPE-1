Title: Traffic Modeling and Variational Inequalities using  
Author: GAMS Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris 
Date: April 1997  
Abstract: We describe how several traffic assignment and design problems can be formulated within the GAMS modeling language using newly developed modeling and interface tools. The fundamental problem is user equilibrium, where multiple drivers compete noncooperatively for the resources of the traffic network. A description of how these models can be written as complementarity problems, variational inequalities, mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints, or stochastic linear programs is given. At least one general purpose solution technique for each model format is briefly outlined. Some observations relating to particular model solutions are drawn.

Reference-contexts: Condition (A2) implies that the probability of more than one state transition during the travel time of a vehicle on an arc (i; j) is negligibly small. Whenever the arcs are uncapacitated, the problem can be solved as a stochastic shortest path problem <ref> [1, 2, 34] </ref>. We analyze the capacitated problem, in which the main issue is the interaction between vehicles that started at different times but reach a node at the same time, thus leading to jams.

Reference-contexts: As an example, consider the simple MPEC below (a reformulation of [32], Example 1): minimize (x; y; u) := x 1 2 2x 1 + x 2 2 + y 2 subject to x i 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref> and (y; u) solves MCP (F (x; ; ); B); (20) where F (x; y; u) := 6 6 2x 1 + 2y 1 + 2 (y 1 1)u 1 (y 1 1) + :25 3 7 5 . <p> Condition (A2) implies that the probability of more than one state transition during the travel time of a vehicle on an arc (i; j) is negligibly small.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, developing an interface that easily allows both algorithm developers and application experts to perform their respective research is difficult. We have chosen to allow modelers to use the GAMS <ref> [3] </ref> modeling language and force algorithmic development to occur in Fortran or C, although a possible extension of this work to support algorithm development in Matlab [17] is possible.

Reference-contexts: One example of an MPEC occurring in traffic network design is described in [31]. The idea is to determine values for some design variables, e.g. arc capacities, that minimize a weighted some of the investment cost and the system operating costs. Another example is described in <ref> [4] </ref>. This is an example of an inverse problem, where estimates of O-D demands are given and the network planner wishes to adjust these demands minimally in order to satisfy the equilibrium conditions. A third example is present in tolling.

Reference-contexts: In the ensuing section, we show how these tools 2 are used in an analysis of a tolling problem over a network representing Sioux-Falls. The problem is cast as an MPEC and two algorithms based on an implicit programming approach, namely DFO <ref> [5] </ref> and the bundle-trust region algorithm [39], are used to demonstrate the ability of these tools and the power of the modeling format. The final section of the paper treats some modeling issues related to traffic assignment and path choice in networks subject to failure. <p> Derivative free optimization has a long history in mathematical programming. We used MPECLIB in conjunction with a prototype Matlab implementation of DFO <ref> [5] </ref> provided by Ph. Toint. This implementation was designed under the assumption that the dimension of the underlying optimization problem is small and the time to evaluate the objective function is large.

Reference-contexts: The first two sections of the paper show how the user equilibrium problem is cast as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP), formulated within the GAMS modeling language, and solved using the PATH algorithm. Some examples of problems formulated using these tools are described in <ref> [6] </ref>. There are many cases when a modeler wishes to optimize an objective function subject to the system being in equilibrium. These problems are commonly called Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC's). The recent monograph [29] describes the current state of optimality theory and algorithms related to such problems.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent formulation of (8) is therefore to find a zero of the nonsmooth equation 0 = F (x + ) + x x + The map F + := F (x + ) + x x + is sometimes referred to as the "normal map", see for example <ref> [11, 37, 38] </ref>. The equivalence is established by noting 8 that if z solves NCP, then x = z F (z) is a zero of the normal map, and if x is a zero of the normal map, then z = x + is a solution of the NCP.

The general case is treated in <ref> [16] </ref>. The problem is as follows. At each node n 2 N there is a constant demand flow s n that must be moved through the network to some destination node D at the minimum expected travel time.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent formulation of (8) is therefore to find a zero of the nonsmooth equation 0 = F (x + ) + x x + The map F + := F (x + ) + x x + is sometimes referred to as the "normal map", see for example <ref> [11, 37, 38] </ref>. The equivalence is established by noting 8 that if z solves NCP, then x = z F (z) is a zero of the normal map, and if x is a zero of the normal map, then z = x + is a solution of the NCP.

Reference-contexts: In the ensuing section, we show how these tools 2 are used in an analysis of a tolling problem over a network representing Sioux-Falls. The problem is cast as an MPEC and two algorithms based on an implicit programming approach, namely DFO [5] and the bundle-trust region algorithm <ref> [39] </ref>, are used to demonstrate the ability of these tools and the power of the modeling format. The final section of the paper treats some modeling issues related to traffic assignment and path choice in networks subject to failure. <p> A promising solution strategy for the implicit program (22) is to apply a "bundle method", that is an algorithm specifically designed to solve non-smooth optimization problems. This idea is presented in [27, 28, 32]. The implementation of the bundle method we used, btnc <ref> [39] </ref>, was developed for bound constrained problems and requires the user to provide a Fortran implementation to evaluate the objective function and a subgradient at a user supplied point. The formulas to generate these quantities were developed in [32] for the MPEC format described in (21).

Reference-contexts: Many papers have discussed the formulation and solution of user equilibrium problems using complementarity and variational inequality models, as well as the applications of these problems to urban planning; see <ref> [18, 19, 21, 30, 40] </ref>. The first two sections of the paper show how the user equilibrium problem is cast as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP), formulated within the GAMS modeling language, and solved using the PATH algorithm. Some examples of problems formulated using these tools are described in [6].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Models that postulate ways to assign traffic within a transportation network for a given demand have been used in planning and analysis for many years, see <ref> [41] </ref> and references therein. A popular technique for such assignment is to use the shortest path between the origin and destination points of a given journey.

In this context, the travel time used to define the "distance" between the origin and destination is a function of the length and capacity of each arc of the path, and the total flow on that path. <p> The first model is based on considering all the paths between the origin-destination pairs, and the second uses a multicommodity formulation, representing each origin or destination node as a different commodity. Both of these formulations use the Wardropian characterizations of equilibria <ref> [42] </ref>, a special case of a Nash equilibrium (see [15, 23]). 2.1 A path based formulation The given path based formulation follows [20]. <p> The model is called a fixed-demand model 5 if each d w (t ) is a constant function; the general model is often called the elastic demand model. The Wardrop equilibrium principle <ref> [42] </ref> states that each driver will choose the minimum cost path between every origin destination pair and through this process, the paths used will all have equal cost; paths with costs higher than the minimum will have no flow. <p> arc (i; j), then the corresponding time to deliver that commodity is minimized: 0 c ij (f ) + t k i ? x k where the arc flow vector f is given by f k2D This is typically termed "Wardrop's second principle", although it appears first in his article <ref> [42] </ref>. It is clear that given an enumeration of the paths, the solution generated from a path based formulation can easily yield a solution to the multicommodity formulation, and vice versa.
