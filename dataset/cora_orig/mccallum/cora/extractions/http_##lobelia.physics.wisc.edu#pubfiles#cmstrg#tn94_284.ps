Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction 1.1 CMS Trigger and Data Acquisition System The CMS trigger and data acquisition system <ref> [1] </ref> is designed to operate at the nominal LHC design luminosity of 10 34 , where an average of 20 inelastic events occur at the beam crossing frequency of 25 nsec.
Reference: [2] <institution> RD-16 Status Report, </institution> <address> CERN/DRDC 94-16 </address>
Reference-contexts: These trigger sums will emerge in 13 (25 nsec) crossings after the input pulse height reaches the front end electronics. The front end electronics for the baseline design is the fully digital FERMI readout system <ref> [2] </ref>. The calorimeter level 1 trigger system receives digital trigger sums via optical fibers from the front end electronics system, which transmits energy on an eight bit compressed scale. <p> The energy summation tree begins on these cards in order to reduce the amount of data forwarded on the backplane to the Jet Summary card. Separate cable connectors and buffering are also provided for intercrate sharing. 4.1 Inputs Each card is designed to receive 32 fibres from the FERMI <ref> [2] </ref> front-end readout system on the calorimeter. Each fibre transmits either two towers of hadronic or electromagnetic information per crossing. The data is transmitted on the fiber in a compressed eight bit format, providing a total of 16 data bits.

Reference-contexts: This card, the Local Timing, Trigger and Control card (LTTC) will interface to the detector Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) distribution system via the timing receiver ASIC produced by the TTC group <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.2 Crate Backplane As mentioned above, the backplane is a monolithic, custom, 9U high printed circuit board with front and back card connectors. The top 3U of the backplane holds 4 row (128 pin) DIN connectors, capable of full 32 bit VME.

Reference-contexts: The method of synchronization we are using was originally proposed to handle the SDC fiber link word synchronization on the SSC <ref> [4] </ref>. We offer here a short description of the technique followed by a detailed description of an ASIC proposed as a local component of the global synchronization method. In order to achieve synchronization with this method several conditions must be met. 1.

Reference-contexts: This implies an overflow at approximately 1000 GeV, using the compressed scale described in the CMS Level 1 Calorimeter Trigger Performance Studies <ref> [5] </ref>. The exact value will depend on the resolution required of the input transverse energy for other trigger functions. <p> Eight memories, cycling at 160 MHz, receive the same data as that shifted in to the reference tower locations in the Isolation ASIC. Only the top 4 bits of the 8-bit electromagnetic data are used. Simulation studies indicate that full resolution on E T is not required <ref> [5] </ref>. The four bits of the hadronic information is combined with the four bits of electromagnetic information, producing an 8-bit address into the H/E lookup table. A single output bit is used to indicate, when true, that H/E &lt; 0.05.
