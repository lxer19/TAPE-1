Title: An experience teaching a graduate course in cryptography  
Author: Aviel D. Rubin 
Address: 251 Mercer St. New York, NY 10012  
Affiliation: New York University  
Abstract: We describe an experience of teaching "Cryptography and Computer Security" in the fall of 1995 at New York University. The class was intended as an introduction for graduate students interested in exploring the historical, theoretical and practical aspects of computer security. Topics covered include classical cryptography, elementary number theory, several security systems, and protocols. The focus on breadth was intentional as the goal of the course was to give students with widely devergent backgrounds exposure to different areas that might interest them. The course content as well as lessons learned and plans for the future are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Then, lecture time was devoted to the effects of combining different algorithms. Another important topic that was covered was hash functions. MD5 [32] and SHA <ref> [1] </ref> were given as good examples of collision free one-way functions. Various uses of hash functions were discussed. The time-stamping system of Haber and Stornetta [18] is one example of an interesting application of hash functions.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the class studied IP-layer encapsulation and key management [21]. One of the groups chose to do their semester project on this topic. The students were introduced to PGP [44], which they were required to understand and use. Tradeoffs between PGP and PEM <ref> [2] </ref> were discussed, along with issues about the web of trust versus a strict hierarchy of certificates. Message formats for both systems (PGP and X.509) were covered.

Reference-contexts: The first system taught was the Data Encryption Standard, DES [30]. The algorithm was discussed in depth, including the individual rounds, the various permutations and substitutions, and what little is known about the design of the S/Boxes. The course touched on differential <ref> [5] </ref> and linear [29] cryptanalysis, exhaustive key search, DES breaking machines [43], and various results from the literature on attacking DES. In addition, hardware and software implementations were compared. Finally, the class learned about key lengths, security and export issues.

Reference-contexts: The Betsi system [35], which uses PGP, and provides integrity assurances to users who download software from the Internet, was also mentioned in class. Considerable time was spent on authentication systems. Among the systems covered in class were one-time password schemes [19, 37], Kerberos [40], Khat [36], and Kryptoknight <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition, secure file systems, such as CFS [7] and SFS [17], were covered. Next, the class was introduced to the concept of evaluation criteria, in particular, the orange book [14] definitions were given. Key agreement protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman [15], were also covered.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the in-depth exploration of DES, the class learned about other symmetric ciphers, such as IDEA [27] and RC4 [34]. During this part of the course, the notion of key escrow (government and commercial) was discussed. The class covered clipper [12], skipjack <ref> [9] </ref>, and TIS's Key Recovery Center [42], along with the potential effect of escrow on allowable key lengths for export. Then, lecture time was devoted to the effects of combining different algorithms. Another important topic that was covered was hash functions.

As part of the computer security section of the course, Anish Bhimani of Bellcore gave a guest lecture on firewalls <ref> [11] </ref>. The class was taught the purpose of firewalls, how they are built and maintained, and their limitations. Two topics of practical significance were password choosing and Unix R fl security. Several studies that demonstrate how poorly users choose passwords were discussed.

Reference-contexts: However, there is some insight into how they were designed and attacked that is useful for looking at modern systems. The first two and a half lectures were devoted to classical cryptography. Students were introduced to some simple ciphers such as substitution, affine, Hill <ref> [20] </ref>, etc. Then, the progression to polyalphabetic ciphers and finally Vernam ciphers was explored. At this time, the notions of known plaintext, chosen plaintext, chosen ciphertext, etc. were introduced. Various techniques, such as index of coincidence and the Kasiski method [23] for cryptanalyzing classical ciphers, were discussed and demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: Next, Unix security was studied. Some classical attacks were presented, as well as common sense system administration. This section concluded with a lecture on computer viruses on three different platforms, Macintosh, PC, and Unix. Finally, Jack Lacy of Bell Labs came to talk about his Cryptolib package <ref> [26] </ref>. It is a library of extremely fast cryptographic routines for almost any platform. The software was released to the students, most of whom used it for their projects. The library proved to be extremely useful. 7 Number Theory The next four lectures dealt with number theory.

Reference-contexts: In this scheme, users who share a common modulus can play poker using the commutative property of RSA encryption. However, by observing which cards were quadratic residues and which were not, a cheating party can obtain a bit of information about each card and cheat <ref> [28] </ref>. The lesson here is that cryptographic algorithms cannot be used as black boxes. A developer must consider the environment in which the algorithm will run, as well as subtleties of the algorithms themselves. The last part of the number theory section was given by a guest lecturer, Stuart Haber.

Reference-contexts: In addition, materials were used from the following books: Doug Stinson's, Cryptography: Theory and Practice [41], Dorothy Denning's Cryptography and Data Security [13], Garfinkel and Spafford's Practical Unix Security [16], Kaufman, Perlman and Speciner's Network Security [24], and William Stalling's Network and Internetwork Security Principles and Practice <ref> [39] </ref>. The cryptography and computer security course was offered in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (http://cims.nyu.edu/) on Tuesday evenings from 5-7, and consisted entirely of graduate students. Some of them had full-time jobs during the day, and were taking courses at night.

Reference-contexts: The Betsi system [35], which uses PGP, and provides integrity assurances to users who download software from the Internet, was also mentioned in class. Considerable time was spent on authentication systems. Among the systems covered in class were one-time password schemes [19, 37], Kerberos <ref> [40] </ref>, Khat [36], and Kryptoknight [6]. In addition, secure file systems, such as CFS [7] and SFS [17], were covered. Next, the class was introduced to the concept of evaluation criteria, in particular, the orange book [14] definitions were given. Key agreement protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman [15], were also covered.

Reference-contexts: Grading was based on five homework sets and a semester project. The course used Bruce Schneier's book, Applied Cryptography [38] as the primary text, which was supplemented by a course pack of selected publications. In addition, materials were used from the following books: Doug Stinson's, Cryptography: Theory and Practice <ref> [41] </ref>, Dorothy Denning's Cryptography and Data Security [13], Garfinkel and Spafford's Practical Unix Security [16], Kaufman, Perlman and Speciner's Network Security [24], and William Stalling's Network and Internetwork Security Principles and Practice [39]. <p> Another goal was to find students who wish to pursue security and crypotgraphy as their area of research. 3 Other courses There are several other courses offered on this topic. Most of these classes cover the basics of cryptography from number theory to symmetric ciphers. Stinson's book <ref> [41] </ref> is the overwhelming favorate. Several of the courses focus on one particular application of cryptography, such as telecommunications or networking. However, the majority of the classes are solely mathematical. In general, the courses offered are graduate courses that are open to advanced undergraduates.

Reference-contexts: During this part of the course, the notion of key escrow (government and commercial) was discussed. The class covered clipper [12], skipjack [9], and TIS's Key Recovery Center <ref> [42] </ref>, along with the potential effect of escrow on allowable key lengths for export. Then, lecture time was devoted to the effects of combining different algorithms. Another important topic that was covered was hash functions. MD5 [32] and SHA [1] were given as good examples of collision free one-way functions.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm was discussed in depth, including the individual rounds, the various permutations and substitutions, and what little is known about the design of the S/Boxes. The course touched on differential [5] and linear [29] cryptanalysis, exhaustive key search, DES breaking machines <ref> [43] </ref>, and various results from the literature on attacking DES. In addition, hardware and software implementations were compared. Finally, the class learned about key lengths, security and export issues. After the design and analysis of DES was taught, students learned how to use this function. Different modes of operation (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Security at different network layers, especially the IETF work on transport and network layer security, received considerable attention. In particular, the class studied IP-layer encapsulation and key management [21]. One of the groups chose to do their semester project on this topic. The students were introduced to PGP <ref> [44] </ref>, which they were required to understand and use. Tradeoffs between PGP and PEM [2] were discussed, along with issues about the web of trust versus a strict hierarchy of certificates. Message formats for both systems (PGP and X.509) were covered.
