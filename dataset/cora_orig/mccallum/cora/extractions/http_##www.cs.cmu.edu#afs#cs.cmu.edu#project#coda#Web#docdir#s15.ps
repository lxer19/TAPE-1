Abstract: In this paper, we describe how the Coda File System has evolved to exploit such networks. The underlying theme of this been modified. As a result, Coda is able to provide good performance even when network bandwidth varies over four orders evolution has been the systematic introduction of adaptivity to eliminate hidden assumptions about strong connectivity.
