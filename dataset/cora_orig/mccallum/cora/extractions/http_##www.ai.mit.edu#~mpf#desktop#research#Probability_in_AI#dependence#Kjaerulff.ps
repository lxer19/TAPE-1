Title: Reduction of Computational Complexity in Bayesian Networks through Removal of Weak Dependences

Abstract: The paper presents a method for reducing the computational complexity of Bayesian networks through identification and removal of weak dependences (removal of links from the (moralized) independence graph). The removal of a small number of links may reduce the computational complexity dramatically, since several fill-ins and moral links may be rendered superfluous by the removal. The method is described in terms of impact on the independence graph, the junction tree, and the potential functions associated with these. An empirical evaluation of the method using large real-world networks demonstrates the applicability of the method. Further, the method, which has been implemented in Hugin, complements the approximation method suggested by Jensen & An dersen (1990).

Reference-contexts: Further, links were removed until a total divergence of at most 0:001 was reached (the total divergence after a series of removals equals the sum of the individual divergences <ref> (Kjrulff 1993) </ref>). Using Inequality (8) the theoretically upper bound on the absolute error is found to be 2%. Table 1 displays the results. The `size' of a network equals the sum of the sizes of the state spaces of the cliques after sensible triangulation. <p> large savings for the MUNIN2 and the Water networks are due partly to the fact that a number of the orphan nodes are instantiated to their `normal' state. 5 DISCUSSION An important feature of a clique-potential approximation is the attenuation of its impact with increasing distance from the target clique <ref> (Kjrulff 1993) </ref>. This feature is especially important in connection with time-sliced Bayesian networks. An additional property of the method, is the property of errors remaining localized in absence of posterior evidence and, under certain conditions, even in presence of posterior evidence (Kjrulff 1993). <p> its impact with increasing distance from the target clique <ref> (Kjrulff 1993) </ref>.
