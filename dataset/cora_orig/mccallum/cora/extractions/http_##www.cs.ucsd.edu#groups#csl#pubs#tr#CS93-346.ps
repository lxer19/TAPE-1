Abstract: Hierarchical coding is a promising technique for handling real-time continuous media (i.e., video, audio, etc.), where timely presentation might be more important than totally lossless presentation. Hierarchical coding allows the receiver to have, and if desired present, a progressively better image as data is received and also allows the network to intelligently discard less important packets when congestion is encountered. We present the results of a simple hierarchically encoded image animation in various environments (hosts and networks). Presented here are results of the quality of the animation when loss was experienced, throughput rates achieved by the animation, near maximum user-to-user throughput rates of the environments tested, and maximum and average packet loss per frame experienced in the experiments. The highest visually-tolerable packet loss per frame was found to be about 2-3% for this animation and these environments. The highest animation rates and maximum throughput rates were measured between two DEC Alpha workstations connected via an FDDI ring. We were able to achieve animation rates of 4.4-5.2 Mbps with 0-1.3% loss, and maximum throughput rates of 33.2-42.1 Mbps with 0-3.4% loss. The maximum throughput rates are much higher because no image processing was done in those experiments, only reception of the image data and recording of statistics. However, in the animation experiment images are processed and displayed which reduces the throughput achieved.

Reference-contexts: Thus, audio and video may be characterized as soft real-time traffic, i.e., they require some kind of statistical delay guarantees, such as percentile of packets (or bits) received within the given delay tolerance <ref> [1] </ref>. This property has the potential to diminish the effects of communication errors, such as those leading to packet loss due to congestion. <p> For example, graceful video quality degradation in the presence of congestion is usually more acceptable than audio degradation, and can be facilitated through the use of hierarchical coding. For the Sequoia 2000 Network guaranteed performance protocols <ref> [1] </ref> being developed at UC Berkeley will provide the necessary functionality.

Reference-contexts: is made possible by the use of hierarchical coding and appropriate traffic labeling. 1.3 The Sequoia 2000 Network and CSL The Sequoia 2000 Network (S2Knet) is a private, wide area packet switched network providing high throughput for distributed scientific applications, and real-time services for multimedia collaboration tools such as video-conferencing <ref> [2] </ref>. It consists mainly of a T1 (1.5 Mb/s) backbone connecting the Sequoia 2000 campuses, and 100 Mb/s FDDI local area networks for local distribution at each campus. <p> The bacbone will soon be upgraded to DS3 (45 Mb/s); the first DS3 link is already in operation connecting UC Berkeley to UC San Diego. The Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) at UCSD, in collaboration with the Tenet Group at UC Berkeley, is responsible for designing the S2Knet <ref> [2] </ref>. The actual construction of the S2Knet is a large distributed engineering effort involving all the Sequoia 2000 sites; a "handbook" serves as an implementation guide as new sites are added, links are upgraded and is continually updated to reflect the current status of the network [9].

Reference-contexts: Image database browsing can also take advantage of the reduced perceived latency of either progressive transmission or transmission of only the most important signal components. Another latency-hiding technique appropriate for image browsing (which can be combined with compression) is the use of abstracts <ref> [3] </ref>. Abstracts are more flexible than compression and hierarchical coding and can provide arbitrary compression ratios, however, they require application dependent computation to achieve these advantages.

Reference-contexts: For example, video using interframe compression produces much lower information rates when there is little motion or change between frames, but generates very high bit rate peaks when there are scene changes or fast motion. Peak-to-mean bit-rate ratio for VBR codecs is usually high. In <ref> [4] </ref> the value 4.7 is reported for one particular codec. VBR coding is used in order to take advantage of the capability of packet switching networks to use statistical multiplexing for efficient utilization of network resources. <p> A more complete discussion of VBR video coding in a high-speed network environment is provided in [8]. 1.1 Hierarchical Coding Hierarchical coding techniques (also referred to as component, layered, or sub-band coding) split signals into components of varying importance <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. The aggregation of these components reconstructs the original data, but subsets of them can also provide various degrees of approximation to the original signal.

Reference-contexts: One can then economize on resources when the information content of the signal is low and expend them when it is high, achieving the best overall (constant) quality at a given cost.

Reference-contexts: Then, it progresses down through the bit-layers, towards the least significant bits, which provide the high resolution sub-signal. Thus each bit-plane (or each bit-plane subset) can be separately encoded, progressively transmitted, and decoded independently from the others. More elaborate hierarchical coding techniques are discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>. Interestingly, with bit-plane separation, the most (visually) important components (i.e., those produced by the MSBs), are also the more highly compressible ones. <p> There are, of course, tradeoffs between the benefits derived from the relative independence of the components produced by hierarchical coding and the total volume of data generated by compressing components individually (in order to achieve their independence). Interestingly, many compression standards support various forms of hierarchical coding <ref> [11] </ref>. Video conferencing for scientific collaboration and animation of scientific visualization sequences, are Sequoia 2000 applications that might benefit from the use of hierarchical coding for communication over packet-switching networks.

Reference-contexts: Packets are sent using a datagram socket, which in turn sends the data as UDP packets. No acknowledgement or flow control is performed in order to maintain a strict open-loop control, send-receive paradigm, as proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>. More specifically, each video frame is fragmented into 264 packets. The packets are then sent in small groups periodically based on an interval time, t, in milliseconds. The packet group size, g, was generally small, 2 or 3, and an integral divisor of 264.
