Title: Network Working Group tbd Request for Comments:  Integrated Service in the Internet Architecture  Status of  
Note: DRAFT  This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  
Date: September 1993  September 28, 1993  
Pubnum: 14ZZ tbd  Memo  
Abstract: This memo discusses an extension to the Internet architecture and protocols to provide "integrated service", i.e., to support real-time as well as best-effort IP service. This memo outlines a proposed technical framework and recommends steps towards engineering and deployment of Internet integrated service. This extension is necessary to meet the growing need for realtime service for multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: Integrated Service Model It is important to have an abstract model of the service qualities to be supported, independent of any particular mechanism used to realize that service. In particular, the service model includes the parameter list or "flow spec" used by a host to request real-time service <ref> [Partridge92] </ref>. The model must also consider the role of cost and/or accounting for the scarce resources being consumed. We are proposing a particular integrated service model that includes guaranteed and predictive service with controlled link-sharing ((XXX Is this too strong a claim at this point? DE)).
