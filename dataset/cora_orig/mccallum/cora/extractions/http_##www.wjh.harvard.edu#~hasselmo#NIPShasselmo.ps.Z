Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.

Reference-contexts: This was possible because feed-forward and feedback connections show different patterns of termination in neocortex. As shown in Figure 2, Layer I contains primarily feedback synapses from other cortical regions <ref> (Cauller and Connors, 1994) </ref>, whereas layer IV contains primarily afferent synapses from the thalamus and feedforward synapses from more primary neocortical structures (Van Essen and Maunsell, 1983).

Reference-contexts: Here we present a model using selective suppression of feedback synaptic transmission during learning to allow simultaneous self-organization and association between two regions. Previous experiments show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine selectively suppresses synaptic transmission within the olfactory cortex (Hasselmo and Bower, 1992; 1993) and hippocampus <ref> (Hasselmo and Schnell, 1994) </ref>. If the model is valid for neocorti-cal structures, cholinergic suppression should be stronger for feedback but not feedfor-ward synapses. Here we review experimental data (Hasselmo and Cekic, 1996) comparing cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layers with predominantly feedfor-ward or feedback synapses. 2.
