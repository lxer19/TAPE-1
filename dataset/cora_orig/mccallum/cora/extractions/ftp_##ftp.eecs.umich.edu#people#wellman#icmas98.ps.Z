Title: A Market Protocol for Decentralized Task Allocation

Abstract: We present a decentralized market protocol for allocating tasks among agents that contend for scarce resources. Agents trade tasks and resources at prices determined by an auction protocol. We specify a simple set of bidding policies that, along with the auction mechanism, exhibits desirable convergence properties. The system always reaches quiescence. If the system reaches quiescence below the consumer's reserve price for the high level task, it will be in a solution state. If the system finds a solution it will reach quiescence in a solution state. Experimental evidence supports our conjecture that the system will converge to a solution when one exists and the consumer bids sufficiently high. We describe the system's application to and implementation in an agent-based digital library.

Reference-contexts: Sandholm [17] describes a variant of CONTRACT NET, in which tasks can be clustered to allow individual agents to bid for complementary inputs as a bundle. Bundling of interdependent resources is an important feature, the subject of much recent research in auction design <ref> [1, 15, 23, 30] </ref>. Auctions have been applied to various other discrete resource allocation problems in the distributed computing literature. The SPAWN system uses auctions to dynamically allocate underutilized processors [25]. Our analysis of market-based decentralized scheduling addresses equilibrium properties of and candidate market protocols for such problems [26].

The Task Allocation Problem In the task allocation problem, we are interested in the achievement of some task or tasks, and tasks may be performed by various agents.

Reference-contexts: But we assume that we are constrained to solve the problem in a decentralized fashion. Task allocation problems can be addressed in a somewhat more decentralized manner by the CONTRACT NET protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. However, because the contracting process proceeds top-down, an agent must commit to supplying a good before it is certain that it can actually acquire its input goods. That is, the protocol allocates goods in a greedy fashion, backward chaining from the consumer to the suppliers. <p> We do not yet have a proof of this conjecture. However our intuition of its correctness is supported by a battery of randomly generated experiments. Each economy had a number of goods, suppliers, and two-input producers, each selected independently from the uniform distribution <ref> [3; 53] </ref>. Each supplier's price was uniformly distributed on [0; 10], = ffi = 0:1 for all producers, and the consumer's reserve price was set sufficiently high. Over 3000 economies converged to a quiescent valid solution. Only economies with no solution failed.

Because producers' technologies are complementary, ensuring feasibility is a challenging problem. Inspired by the FCC actions, we designed our auctions to run simultaneously and reject an agent's bid if it does not increase over its previous bid (see <ref> [12] </ref> for a preliminary analysis of simultaneous ascending auctions). This design helps give producers an accurate indication of the relative prices for inputs and outputs.

However, many important resource allocation problemssuch as task allocationare inherently discrete, violating the standard general conditions for market effectiveness. 1 Within economics, protocols for allocation of discrete goods have been studied under the heading of auction theory.
