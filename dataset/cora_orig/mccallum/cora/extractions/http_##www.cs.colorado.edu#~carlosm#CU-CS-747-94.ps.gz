Abstract: Members of a community who work primarily at computer terminals are deprived from distributed cognition as it occurs in many other domains where people work with tools in a shared physical space. This makes it harder for individuals to pick up cues towards useful tools and their utilizations. Traditional help systems were unsuccessful to fill in this gap of information ow. People prefer to consult other people in their community because either their tool knowledge is contextualized appropriately or they know other people who can help. In this paper we describe the design and preliminary evaluation of a system that is actively looking for new tools and is interviewing potential experts. The result of these interviews is presented by weekly newsletters and a hypertext system in World Wide Web format. We specifically address design issues of and experience with the interviewing process and the presentation of the resulting information. People share tools via networked computers. The design of these systems, however, tend to prevent people from sharing practical knowledge about how to use these tools. Our paper identifies the consequences of this situation and presents a fully functional prototype which supports the exchange of practical knowledge. The following example illustrates how computers make practical use of tools invisible: Consider a mechanic shop with its abundance of tools hanging from perfboards, lying on work benches or on the oor. A good way to find out about the various purposes of these tools is to watch mechanics using these tools. Compare this situation with a modern multiple room office where people work at networked computers: Without taking a careful look on a persons screen one cannot see any tools. People are punching keys - no matter what tools they use and how they use them. Furthermore, screens are considered to be private areas. It is usually not socially acceptable to stare over somebodys shoulder. Thus, people who are working in a computer environment are less exposed to the practical use of tools.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, in order to retrieve information the system requires the user to pose a query. However, it is often difficult to come up with effective queries without having sufficient knowledge about the domain structure [10]. 1.

Reference-contexts: Instead, users prefer to consult their colleagues or local experts [7] [9]. Asking another person has the advantage of a certain response [8], which contains either contextu-alized information, i.e., information that is grounded in the domain of the local community <ref> [2] </ref> [14] [16], or a pointer to another person who might know the answer [11]. The latter has also the advantage that it potentially extends the personal list of social contacts to experts. Asking another person involves, however, bothering people, i.e. interrupting their work. Furthermore, asking involves informal conversations.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, DYK structures its information through a pre-set, non-hierarchical set of categories. It thus does not offer much support for users who look for a particular piece of information. A nice account of the difficulty of collaboratively structuring a group memory is given in <ref> [3] </ref> which describes the design and implementation of TeamInfo. The basic idea of TeamInfo is to offer a group version of the various private collections of email folders. The authors report on their experience with trying to collaboratively achieve a consensus on the structure of a group memory.

Reference-contexts: Although 389 different tools were used only few people used more than 10 tools. This data seems to confirm studies which conclude that most people in a computer environment are experts for a small set of commands and novices for the rest of it (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>). Since this kind of expertise is distributed over a large set of commands it is of great advantage to every member of the community to know local experts. 2.2 Motivating Community Construction As a community constructed system ToolBox relies on the active participation of its user community.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, the Interviewer would be integrated with electronic mail (see for instance the Active Mail approach in <ref> [5] </ref>) and Mosaic such that the user does not need to call an extra application when receiving a message from the Solicitor and can take advantage of the navigation facilities and graphical user interface of Mosaic.

Reference-contexts: Thus the system design needs to ensure that each class of users within the target community benefits from its use <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, ToolBox needs to offer benefits for the consumer of tool information as well as for the person who adds new information to Number of people Number of tools per person 5 15 25 35 ToolBox 5 the system.

Reference-contexts: Exploring the on-line environment tends to be time consuming and unproductive [13]. Instead, users prefer to consult their colleagues or local experts <ref> [7] </ref> [9].

However, the author assumes that users voluntarily contribute knowledge and does not address motivational issues, such as benefit of use and the overhead of adding new knowledge.

Reference-contexts: In the advent of new tools, Answer Garden does not support the discovery of new experts. The authors assume formally assigned experts, i.e., maintaining Answer Garden is part of their job, and do not consider any other motivations. DYK (Did You Know) <ref> [12] </ref> allows any member of a community to add new pieces of information to a directory service. The design carefully accounts for motivational issues, i.e., it tries to be an attractive displacement activity by being user-invoked, by presenting small pieces of information and by being engaging. <p> There is evidence that task-oriented explorations are more effective than task-free explorations [13]. Important for the acceptance of the interviewing process is how well it fits in everyday practice of the community. For example, users often engage in displacement activities <ref> [12] </ref>. In order to take the role of a displacement activity the interview (i) needs to be brief, (ii) can be aborted at any time and without cost, and (iii) offer some informal contact with the rest of the community.

Reference-contexts: Exploring the on-line environment tends to be time consuming and unproductive <ref> [13] </ref>. Instead, users prefer to consult their colleagues or local experts [7] [9]. <p> These, however, present information in a very general, de-contextualized way which makes it difficult to discover useful tools for a given situation. Thus, the search can be time consuming and unproductive <ref> [13] </ref>. This is especially true for keyword oriented systems like man in Unix 1 since appropriate keyword selection requires knowledge about the overall structure of the corresponding domain [10]. Also, for novices on-line help systems are often as difficult to discover as any other tool. <p> However, the user explores this space in the context of the interview, i.e. his/her explorations are task-oriented. There is evidence that task-oriented explorations are more effective than task-free explorations <ref> [13] </ref>. Important for the acceptance of the interviewing process is how well it fits in everyday practice of the community. For example, users often engage in displacement activities [12]. <p> In traditional tool manuals the user can be overwhelmed by the technical detail s/he is confronted with once s/he has found a potentially useful tool <ref> [13] </ref>. Often it turns out that - - after spending too much time in the reading of irrelevant details -- the tool is not appropriate at all. In our design of ToolBox we strived to avoid this situation by providing some kind of bulletin board for each tool.

Reference-contexts: Another problem is to represent such a multidimensional space in an effective manner. Furthermore, adding new dimensions to this space would have an effect on the classification of the other tools and on the presentation of the space. Semantic relationships are often represented by directed graphs (e.g. <ref> [15] </ref>). However, with sufficient size of the network, orientation becomes increasingly difficult.
