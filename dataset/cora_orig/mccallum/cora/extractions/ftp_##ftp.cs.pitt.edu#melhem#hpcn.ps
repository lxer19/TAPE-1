Abstract: We present a tool for balanced decomposition of spatial domains. In addition to applying a nested bisection algorithm to determine the boundaries of each subdomain, the tool replicates a user specified zone along the boundaries of the subdomain in order to minimize future interactions between subdomains. Results of running the tool on the Cray T3D system, as well as using it in the implementation of a parallel Particle-particle/Particle-Mesh code are reported and discussed.

Reference-contexts: This package can be used for a large class of scientific applications which exhibit the spatially dependent fine-grained parallelism.

The program is based on the algorithm given in Hockney and Eastwood [4] though other algorithms like the one in Balsara and Brandt <ref> [1] </ref> would also benefit from the strategies developed here. Thus the utility of Bisect extends to almost all forms of plasma physics simulations. The P 3 M algorithm evaluates the gravitational force on a system of self-gravitating particles.

Reference-contexts: Each object has a number of data attributes and is associated with a weight which may be set to reflect the amount of computation needed to process that object. The nested bisection algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> is incorporated in the Bisect package to redistribute the objects among the processors such that: 1) each processor is assigned objects that fall in a rectangular 3-dimensional subdomain, and 2) the sum of the weights of the objects assigned to each processor is almost uniform among the processors.

Reference-contexts: The package uses the nested bisection method to achieve dynamic load balancing for applications in which computations are non-uniformly distributed over some physical domain <ref> [3] </ref>. Specifically, given N objects, each being associated with a position in a physical domain, the domain is decomposed into disjoint subdomains, and each subdomain, along with the objects it contains, is mapped to a different processor.
