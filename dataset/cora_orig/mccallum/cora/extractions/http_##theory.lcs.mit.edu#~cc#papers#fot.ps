Abstract: We show that oblivious transfer can be based on a very general notion of asymmetric information difference. We investigate a Universal Oblivious Transfer, denoted UOT(X; Y ), that gives Bob the freedom to access Alice's input X in an arbitrary way as long as he does not obtain full information about X. Alice does not learn which information Bob has chosen. We show that oblivious transfer can be reduced to a single execution of UOT(X; Y ) with Bob's knowledge Y restricted in terms of Renyi entropy of order ff &gt; 1. For independently repeated UOT the reduction works even if only Bob's Shannon information is restricted, i.e. if H(XjY ) &gt; 0 in every UOT(X; Y ). Our protocol requires that honest Bob obtains at least half of Alice's information X without error.

Reference-contexts: The results are stated in terms of the extension of 2 -OT to k-bit string oblivious transfer, denoted 2 protocol is essentially the same as used by Brassard and Crepeau for simplifying the implementation of string OT from 2 -OT [BC97] and is based on privacy amplification <ref> [BBCM95] </ref>. In extension of their work, our protocol can be based on any universal hash function. Bob's information is measured in terms of min-entropy H 1 , Renyi entropy H ff of order ff &gt; 1, and Shannon entropy H (see Section 2 for definitions). <p> Research on reductions from 2 -OT k string OT to bitwise 2 -OT has for a long time concentrated on using self-intersecting codes for the constructions [BCS96], but recent work by Brassard and Crepeau [BC97] shows that the reduction can be done much more efficiently using privacy amplification <ref> [BBR86, ILL89, BBCM95] </ref>. This technique allows to weaken the security assumptions for Bob, permitting him not only to read one of the two bits, but also the XOR of both bits or even any binary function of them (GOT). Brassard and Crepeau also suggested the further generalization to UOT. <p> Entropy smoothing by universal hashing is a widely-used technique to concentrate the randomness inherent in a probability distribution known in different contexts as privacy amplification <ref> [BBR86, BBCM95] </ref> or the leftover hash lemma [ILL89]. In cryptography, privacy amplification can be used to extract a short secret key from shared information about which an adversary has partial knowledge. <p> The following theorem shows that if Alice and Bob choose g at random from a universal hash function G : W ! Y for suitable Y, then Eve's information about Y = g (W ) is negligible. Theorem 1 (Privacy Amplification <ref> [BBCM95] </ref>). Let X be a random variable over the alphabet X with Renyi entropy H 2 (X), let G be the random variable corresponding to the random choice (with uniform distribution) of a member of a universal hash function G : X ! Y, and let Y = G (X). <p> The theorem can be extended from Renyi entropy of order 2 to any order ff &gt; 1 [Cac97b]. Proofs for applications of privacy amplification often involve spoiling knowledge <ref> [BBCM95, Cac97a] </ref>: Suppose side information is made available to Bob by an oracle. The side information is tailored for Bob's distribution and serves the purpose of increasing his Renyi entropy of order 2. This can be exploited to extract a larger secret key by privacy amplification. <p> For ff ! 1, Renyi entropy of order ff becomes Shannon entropy, but a lower bound on the Shannon entropy H (XjY = y) is not sufficient for applying privacy amplification <ref> [BBCM95] </ref>. For example, suppose H (XjY = y) l. Then Bob could choose to obtain the complete 2n-bit string X with probability 1 l 2n and an uncorrelated 2n-bit string otherwise.

Reference-contexts: if we allow Bob to choose from a much more general class of channels that is characterized only by the amount of information that observing the channel output gives about the input? The corresponding primitive is called a universal oblivious transfer (UOT) and has been proposed by Brassard and Crepeau <ref> [BC97] </ref>. For example, Bob could be allowed to read both of Alice's bits through a binary symmetric channel, which flips each bit independently with some probability. Or Bob could compute secretly any function of Alice's information as long as the function's range is smaller than its domain. <p> The results are stated in terms of the extension of 2 -OT to k-bit string oblivious transfer, denoted 2 protocol is essentially the same as used by Brassard and Crepeau for simplifying the implementation of string OT from 2 -OT <ref> [BC97] </ref> and is based on privacy amplification [BBCM95].

This paper extends their work <ref> [BC97] </ref> and solves most of their open problems. 1.3 Organization of the Paper UOT and the protocol for reducing 2 -OT k to UOT are introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, reduction to one execution of UOT is investigated. <p> Our reductions follow the information-theoretic definitions of unconditional security for oblivious transfer and other multiparty protocols <ref> [BCS96, BC97, DPP96] </ref>, but formal treatment lies not in the scope of this paper. Informally, an OT protocol is correct if it accomplishes the transmission of information between honest parties. <p> Then 2 -OT k string OT can be reduced to a single execution of UOT (X; f (X)). As mentioned in Section 1.2, string OT can be reduced to generalized oblivious transfer (GOT), where Bob can obtain any binary function from a pair of bits held by Alice <ref> [BC97] </ref>. The reduction from string OT uses GOT n times, so that Bob in fact can obtain any n-bit function of n pairs of bits that can be computed pairwise. Corollary 4 generalizes this to arbitrary n-bit functions of Alice's 2n bits. <p> For i = 1; : : : ; n, Alice and Bob run UOT (X (i) ; Y (i) ), where Bob chooses P Y (i) jX (i) =x (i) for x (i) 2 f0; 1g such that he obtains X (i) Repeated UOT was proposed by Brassard and Crepeau <ref> [BC97] </ref> without explicitly addressing the question of independence among the instances of UOT. We distinguish between three forms of dependence for the repetition of UOT in order of increasing generality, corresponding to increasing power for Bob.

Reference-contexts: Key factors that distinguish different flavors of UOT are whether repeated execution of UOT is allowed and which information measure is used to restrict Bob's knowledge. As an example of UOT consider the black-box function model, as e.g. studied by Kilian <ref> [Kil91] </ref>.

In the two-party case, Alice and Bob send their inputs to f over private channels to the black box but the output of f is public and available to both. The particular f computed by the box is known to Alice and Bob.

Reference-contexts: In non-repeated use of noisy UOT, error correction has to succeed always except with negligible probability; methods similar to those used in worst-case communication complexity <ref> [Orl90] </ref> can be employed to correct errors, but the matter is complicated by the fact that interaction is generally not possible or Alice could learn something about Bob's choice.
