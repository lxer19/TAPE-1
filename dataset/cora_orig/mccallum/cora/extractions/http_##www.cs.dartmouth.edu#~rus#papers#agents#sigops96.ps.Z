Reference-contexts: This idea is similar to popular visual programming languages. An agent-console tool allows a workstation user to monitor the agents that flow through their workstation, examine the resources that they use, and control resource management policies. Related work Our work builds on previous work in agents <ref> [Age94] </ref>, primarily in the AI community, and in transportable code [GM94, TTP + 95, JdT + 95, SJ95], primarily in the systems community. There are a few other projects about transportable agents [JvS95, Whi94a, Whi94b, Col95, CGH + 95, SG90].

Reference-contexts: Dartmouth's Agent Tcl project At Dartmouth we are applying a unique combination of operating systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics experience to the design of a transportable autonomous agents system and several demonstration applications. The keystone of our work has been the development of Agent Tcl <ref> [Gra95] </ref>, an extension of the Tcl scripting language. An Agent Tcl program (agent) can simply "jump" from machine to machine, with the interpreter saving and transferring the state to a remote machine, which restarts the agent from that state in a new interpreter.

Reference-contexts: Resource manager agents implement access policies for certain critical resources such as the file system, the screen, the speaker, and the keyboard. Agents must negotiate with the appropriate resource manager before they can access the resource. The Agent Tcl interpreter uses Safe Tcl <ref> [LO95] </ref> to ensure that an agent can neither bypass the 2 negotiation step nor violate the restrictions provided by the resource manager. Thus, the interpreter provides the mechanism, but the resource managers provide the policy. Resource allocation.

Reference-contexts: Advanced communication. Agent Tcl provides the ability for agents to communicate through direct connections and through message passing. We are building higher-level agent communication mechanisms on top of these primitives. Agent remote procedure call (ARPC) <ref> [NCK96] </ref> allows server agents to register with a "name server" agent by specifying their interface using a flexible definition language. Client agents specify the desired service by providing a similar specification. The name server matches the two specifications and provides a list of server agents that "speak" the interface.
