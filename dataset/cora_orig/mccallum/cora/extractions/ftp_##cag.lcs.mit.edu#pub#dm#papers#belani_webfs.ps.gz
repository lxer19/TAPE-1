Title: Authentication and Security in WebFS  
Author: Eshwar Belani Alex Thornton Min Zhou 
Abstract: In this paper we present a framework for security and authentication which integrates cleanly into WebFS. We believe that such a framework is integral to the viability of WebFS as a solution for collaborative work and as a file system for general-purpose distributed computing. The need for security features which may be incorporated in a painless manner, scalable secure services, transparent handling of security features, and performance are some of the principles that have guided our design. These aspects are best illustrated by the fact that the security features of our framework can be used by unmodified applications (which are not security aware) in an effective way. In this paper we discuss our motivating constraints, the different components of our design and the status of the current implementation of secure WebFS. We further describe an application which we built to illustrate the usefulness of our framework in a collaborative work setting.

Reference-contexts: Secure transmission of data Secure transmission of data is essential, given the insecurity of the underlying Internet <ref> [2] </ref>. It must be true that data can be sent from a server to a client without being intercepted and understood or patched by an adversary in order for the framework to be globally useful as anything but a recreational tool. 2.

Reference-contexts: The interface must not only allow for fine grain access control but must also mechanisms through which it can be used effectively in a painless way. 3. A secure, transparent authentication pro tocol A secure authentication protocol is necessary <ref> [3] </ref> to establish the identity of entities performing file operations. Without such an authentication protocol, access control is clearly infeasible. The authentication protocol must be designed so that it is not too cumbersome for users to incorporate it into their work habits. <p> dom numbers to make sure that the message is not an old one being replayed. 2.3.2 Formal Analysis of the Authentication Protocol The approach we use for the analysis of the authentication protocol is based on a formal logic model for the analysis of knowledge and belief, called BAN logic <ref> [3] </ref>. BAN logic is the most widely used logic for analyzing authentication protocols. It assumes that authentication is a function of integrity and freshness, and uses logical rules to trace both of those attributes through the protocol. <p> The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for the derivations of the postulates. To analyze the protocol we first give the assumptions : 1. A believes K A 2. A believes K S 3. B believes K B 4. B believes K S 5. A believes (S controls K B 6.

Reference-contexts: certificates, the infrastructure of certification authorities that is needed, handling groups of users and the transparent certification management policy that is used by WebFS. 2 2.2.1 Certificates The format of the certificates used is the same as that recommended in the ISO authentication framework also known as the X.509 protocols <ref> [4] </ref>. The specification of the structure for the public key certificates forms an important part of X.509. A trusted Certification Authority (CA) assigns a unique name to each user and issues a signed certificate containing the name and the user's public key as shown in figure 2. <p> The session could be augmented with a simple chat program as described in [17] which provides two way interactivity between the students and the instructor thus facilitating questions and answers. 5 Related Work Our security model is based on the conceptual framework provided by the X.509 protocol suite <ref> [4] </ref>. The use of membership certificates for groups in our model is similar to that used in the Taos operating system [20]. Users in Bayou, a weakly replicated storage system [15], also maintain their digitally signed certificates for access control in certificate purses.

Reference-contexts: Kerberos provides secure network authentication, allowing a person to access different machines on the network. However it is based on symmetric key rather than public key cryptography. There are currently two leading specifications for cryptographically enhanced Web services * Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) [12], * The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) <ref> [7] </ref> Both S-HTTP and SSL augment Web browsers and servers with cryptographic algorithms for authentication and privacy, and have been used to enhance the security of HTTP. The implementations of these protocol specifications are emerging technologies as the specifications themselves are still evolving.

Reference-contexts: Also present in the original implementation was a cache consistency model much like that in the Andrew File System <ref> [8] </ref>. However, each local cache entry was indexed by filename, and there was no notion of a set of users who could access the cached copy of the file.

Reference-contexts: To gain an understanding of how the different components interact we describe the sequence of events when an application makes a read request for a remote WebFS file. * Application makes a read request for a WebFS file. * The operating system translates it into a vnode <ref> [9] </ref> read operation. * The vnode layer checks to see if the read opera tion can be satisfied in the kernel. * If not, the vnode layer forwards the request to the user level WebFS code. * The local WebFS code opens a connections to cgi-bin programs on the remote machine

Reference-contexts: The certificate cache is used as a hint and the penalty for being wrong is the extra delay incurred because of sending all the remaining certificates across the network. 2.3 The Authentication Protocol Authentication protocols are the basis of security in many distributed systems <ref> [10] </ref>, and it is therefore essential to ensure that these protocols function correctly. The goal of authentication can be stated rather simply. After authentication, two entities should be entitled to believe that they are communicating with each other and not with intruders.

In addition, we have used 10 MD-5 hashing to verify the authenticity of member-ship certificates.

The CA has its own public/private key pair and certificates signed with the private key of the CA are trusted. For the Internet there is no central CA.

Reference-contexts: One of our main goals was to employ security mechanisms which could be used by unmodified applications too and so we emphasized on providing transparency. In Taos, applications need to be security aware and the security features can must be accessed through a narrow interface. Kerberos <ref> [14] </ref> is a trusted third-party authentication protocol designed for TCP/IP networks. A Ker-beros service, sitting on the network, acts as a trusted arbitrator. Kerberos provides secure network authentication, allowing a person to access different machines on the network. However it is based on symmetric key rather than public key cryptography.

Reference-contexts: A better scheme would be to have WebFS transparently decide which of the user's certificates is to be used for a particular access. To make all their certificates accessible to WebFS users maintain a certificate purse <ref> [15] </ref>. So whenever an access to a file is made WebFS checks the user's certificate purse to see if any of the certificates is allowed access to the file. If one such certificate is found then the user is allowed access otherwise access is denied. <p> The use of membership certificates for groups in our model is similar to that used in the Taos operating system [20]. Users in Bayou, a weakly replicated storage system <ref> [15] </ref>, also maintain their digitally signed certificates for access control in certificate purses. Taos incorporates a new operating system component which handles security issues for a distributed system [20]. It employs compound credentials to express the complex relationships among users, machines, and programs.
