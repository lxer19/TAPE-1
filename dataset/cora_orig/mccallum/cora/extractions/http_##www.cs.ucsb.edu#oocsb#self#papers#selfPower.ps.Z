Abstract: SELF is an object-oriented language for exploratory programming based on a small number of simple and concrete ideas: prototypes, slots, and behavior. Prototypes combine inheritance and instantiation to provide a framework that is simpler and more exible than most object-oriented languages. Slots unite variables and procedures into a single construct. This permits the inheritance hierarchy to take over the function of lexical scoping in conventional languages. Finally, because SELF does not distinguish state from behavior, it narrows the gaps between ordinary objects, procedures, and closures. SELFs simplicity and expressiveness offer new insights into object-oriented computation.

Reference-contexts: of variables: local variables (temporaries), instance variables, class variables, pool variables, and global variables, whose scopes roughly correspond to rungs on a ladder of instantiation. 10 UNGAR AND SMITH 4 Closures and Methods The Lisp community has obtained excellent results with closures (or lambda-expressions) as a basis for control structures <ref> [1, 17] </ref>. Experience with Smalltalk blocks supports this; closures provide a powerful, yet easy-to-use metaphor for users to exploit and define their own control structures. Furthermore, this ability is crucial to any language that supports user-defined abstract data types.

Reference-contexts: However, they do not all offer exactly the same perspective; there are many different ideas about the nature of object-oriented computation. In this paper, we present SELF, a programming language with a new perspective on objects and message passing. Like the Smalltalk-80 1 language <ref> [6] </ref>, SELF is designed to support exploratory programming *This work is partially supported by Xerox, and partially by National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Grant #CCR-8657631, Sun Microsystems, the Powell Foundation, IBM, Apple Computer, DEC, NCR, Texas Instruments, and Cray Laboratories. <p> Assignable slot for contents. | ) 8 Related Work We would like to express our deep appreciation to the past and present members of the System Concepts Laboratory at Xerox PARC for blazing the trail with Small-talk <ref> [6] </ref>. The way SELF accesses state via message passing owes much to conversations with Peter Deutsch, and is reminiscent of an earlier unpublished language of his called O. Some Smalltalk programmers have already adopted this style of variable accessing [11].

Like our design for SELF, objects are created by cloning exemplars, and multiple representations of the same data type are permitted. Unlike SELF, this system also includes classes as an abstract type hierarchy, and two forms of multiple inheritance. One interesting contribution is the exemplar systems support for or-inheritance.
