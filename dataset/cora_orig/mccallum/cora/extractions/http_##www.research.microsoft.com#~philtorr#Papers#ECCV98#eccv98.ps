Abstract: Motion segmentation involves identifying regions of the image that correspond to independently moving objects. The number of independently moving objects, and type of motion model for each of the objects is unknown a priori. In order to perform motion segmentation, the problems of model selection, robust estimation and clustering must all be addressed simultaneously. Here we place the three problems into a common Bayesian framework; investigating the use of model averaging-representing a motion by a combination of models|as a principled way for motion segmentation of images. The final result is a fully automatic algorithm for clustering that works in the presence of noise and outliers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Detection of independently moving objects is an essential but often neglected precursor to problems in computer vision e.g. efficient video compression <ref> [3] </ref>, video editing, surveillance, smart tracking of objects etc. The work in this paper stems from the desire to develop a general motion segmentation and grouping algorithm. That is, given two or more views of a scene, determine any of the objects within the scene which change their relative dispositions. <p> There have been a few methods that have combined segmentation and model selection including Darrell et al [7], Gu et al [15], and the layered representation of Ayer & Sawhney <ref> [3] </ref>, but none of these methods supports completely general models that may be of differing dimensions (see Section 2). Traditionally, all the potential models are fitted and a model selection procedure is used to select which one is best [23, 48]. <p> It might prove desirable to adjust the way that the motion models are determined to incorporate information from all pixels, not just highly textured areas. This is the approach followed by Ayer & Sawhney <ref> [3] </ref>; although they use only projectivities as motion models; and it is not clear how much extra advantage to the estimation of the motion models is gained by including non-textured regions of pixels in the minimization.

Reference-contexts: This inference is called `Maximum Likelihood Estimation' (Fisher 1936 [11]). Numerical methods for finding these two and three view relations are given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Robust Estimation The above derivation assumes that the errors are Gaussian, often however features are mismatched and the error on m is not Gaussian. Thus a a robust log likelihood error function (e 2 i ) is used in place of l (m; R). <p> Optimal Clustering: The initial set of matches is obtained by cross correlation as described in <ref> [4] </ref>. The problem is to optimally group them into sets consistent with the different motion models. This involves finding the most probable underlying interpretation , being a classification into several motion models together with the parameters of those models.

Furthermore corner features indicate pixels where both components of image motion might be recovered with reasonable accuracy; providing a strong constraint on the motion model.

Reference-contexts: This integral is typically of a high dimension and difficult to evaluate, but can be adequately approximated if it is assumed that k can be approximated as a multivariate Gaussian N ( k ; fl 1 k by Laplace's method [37] following the derivation given in <ref> [39] </ref> as log (jR k ) log (j ^ k ) 2 where D = dn + k is the total number of parameters in the system, and N = 2nI is the total number of observations, n the number of matches, I the number of images and d the dimension

Reference-contexts: Although this is a standard result the derivation will reveal that there are more parameters to be considered in the model formulation than just the explicit parameters of given in the last section and Table 1. These additional parameters are sometimes referred to as nuisance parameters <ref> [40] </ref>. This is important as in Section 4 it will be seen that the prior distribution of R is related to the number of parameters that need to be estimated.

Reference-contexts: Given this image triplet as input the ultimate goal would be to identify that the robot has moved independently of the background. Motion segmentation turns out to be a most demanding problem and has received considerable attention over the years (see <ref> [5, 14, 13, 22, 30, 35, 41, 45] </ref> for a review). Many previous approaches to motion clustering have failed because the motion models that they employ are inappropriate.

Reference-contexts: Three Views: The four classifications apply to the three view case and are now briefly summarized. Corresponding points in three images, and corresponding lines in three images, satisfy trilinear relations which are encapsulated in the trifocal tensor <ref> [18, 42, 43] </ref>. When the scene is viewed under orthographic conditions the affine camera model is most appropriate and the image correspondences can be well fitted by relation R 2 the affine trifocal tensor T A [45].

Reference-contexts: Information about spatial proximity is used to exploit the spatial cohesion of moving objects, by sampling correspondence sets that are close to each other (propinquintal) in the image. (c) If the number of inliers in C j is below a threshold (determined from <ref> [44] </ref>), such that it is more likely to have arisen by a chance combination of outliers than an independently moving object, then stop extracting clusters and begin the dense segmentation stage.

Many previous approaches to motion clustering have failed because the motion models that they employ are inappropriate. <p> In contrast to these simplified motion models even the use of the most general model for segmentation can produce poor results; as it can lead to over fitting and hence a bad segmentation in which smaller objects might be missed <ref> [45] </ref>. Thus the need for a more general framework is apparent; one that can adaptively select the motion model for each object in the course of fitting. <p> When the scene is viewed under orthographic conditions the affine camera model is most appropriate and the image correspondences can be well fitted by relation R 2 the affine trifocal tensor T A <ref> [45] </ref>. If the camera motion is pure rotation, or a plane is observed, then the line and point correspondences are determined by relation R 3 and R 4 image-image homographies.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, all the potential models are fitted and a model selection procedure is used to select which one is best <ref> [23, 48] </ref>. When many models are initially considered, it often happens that several of them fit the data almost equally well, or that different models are arrived at by different model selection methods.
