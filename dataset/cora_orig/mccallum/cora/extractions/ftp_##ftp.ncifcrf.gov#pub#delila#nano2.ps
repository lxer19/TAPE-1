Since Boolean variable X has only two possibilities, setting it must dissipate at least 1E min joules. As Feynman pointed out, we can't avoid this dissipation.

Reference-contexts: These machines would have to dissipate at least the quantity of energy required by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, as given by equation (15). Fortunately this is only a tiny quantity compared to today's computers <ref> (Keyes, 1988) </ref>, so molecular computers should be compact and energy efficient.

Reference-contexts: The bacterium Escherichia coli has approximately 2600 genes (Schneider et al., 1986), each of which starts with a ribosome binding site. These have to be located from about 4.7 million bases of RNA which the cell can produce <ref> (Kohara et al., 1987) </ref>. So the problem is to locate 2600 things from a set of 4:7 fi 10 6 possibilities, and not make any mistakes.

Reference-contexts: In the recent literature some authors often claim that E min is not a limit at all or that information loss (rather than gain) is associated with dissipation <ref> (Landauer, 1991) </ref>. However, this relationship is merely (!) a restatement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics Theory of Molecular Machines 4 (Schneider, 1991b), so those who contest it are unlikely to be correct. We will investigate the source of this confusion. <p> Because of equation (18), they then think that entropy is proportional to information. Thus a measure of "disorder" becomes associated with "information" and the confusion is complete. To avoid this widespread error, always measure information as a decrease in uncertainty. 6 Landauer's statement that "throwing away information requires dissipation" <ref> (Landauer, 1991) </ref> contradicts this form of the Second Law. Suppose we have a binary device which can be either in a 0 or a 1 state. Let us define "erase" and "reset" to mean to set the device to 0, starting from either the 0 or 1 state.

Reference-contexts: We will sketch the proof of this amazing result. Level 2 theory (Schneider, 1991b) deals with the ancient problem of Maxwell's demon <ref> (Leff & Rex, 1990) </ref> and shows that there is an energetic cost to molecular operations: at least E min = k B T ln (2) joules must be dissipated to the surroundings for every bit of information gained by the machine (where k B is Boltzmann's constant and T is the <p> Since it has not been clear what kind of work the demon performs, he has been causing consternation ever since <ref> (Leff & Rex, 1990) </ref>. To see the gas molecule, Brillouin supplied the demon with an "electric torch" (Brillouin, 1951). Clearly most of the photons won't bounce off the gas molecules and they would change the energy of the molecules if they did (from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). <p> Thus we can 4 At this point, an anonymous reviewer asked why the problem was not phrased in terms of "the resetting of the demon" because this is said to be the important energy dissipating step by people concerned with the limits of computation <ref> (Leff & Rex, 1990) </ref>. To "reset" usually means to set the state of a binary device to 0. That requires choosing one state from two since one could alternatively "reset" to 1. <p> The elimination of the demon from our discussion of these issues will not be a tragic loss. The demon has been like the proverbial angels-on-a-pinhead in that no two people agree on how to define the issues involved. This has led to a huge and confused literature <ref> (Leff & Rex, 1990) </ref>. We can clarify the problem of molecular sorting by replacing the imaginary demon with examples of real molecular machines. <p> One of the confusing issues here is that the dissipation of a computer need not be cor Theory of Molecular Machines 29 related to the number of Boolean operations we write down.

Reference-contexts: An excited molecule of rhodopsin can flip into a state called bathorhodopsin (Fig. 11). In vertebrate eyes, once a single bathorhodopsin has formed it triggers 400,000 chemical reactions, which then cause a nerve impulse. For this reason, we can see single photons <ref> (Lewis & Priore, 1988) </ref>. All this happens at room temperature, so the molecule operates in the presence of thermal noise.

Reference-contexts: Having dissected the little bugger, let's see if he's still alive. The Second Law was formulated because nobody could find a way around its various constraints on heat and work. No known violations exist, even at the molecular level <ref> (McClare, 1971) </ref>. Some people think that molecules can somehow bypass the Second Law because 8 These steps could be linked to save energy. Theory of Molecular Machines 28 they are so small.

Reference-contexts: Other groups are now using these techniques to study a variety of molecular systems (Berg & von Hippel, 1987; Mars & Beaud, 1987; Berg & von Hippel, 1988; Eiglmeier et al., 1989; Stormo, 1990; Fields, 1990; Penotti, 1990; Penotti, 1991; Shenkin et al., 1991; Day, 1992). Level 1 theory <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref> explains the amazingly precise actions taken by these molecules. <p> Our success so far in applying information theory to biology (i.e. Level 0) suggests that the channel capacity results should also apply, but to do this we must translate these ideas into biological terms. We will sketch this translation using the ribosome as an example. Please refer to <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref> for a more rigorous derivation. Biologists use the analogy of a lock and key to describe the precise interaction of an enzyme and its substrate (Gilbert & Greenberg, 1984). <p> A representation of the corresponding "key" is shown in Fig. 5. The model we are building says that: (1) The pins of the ribosome are, to a first approximation, spread linearly along a groove into which the RNA fits. (2) The pins move independently. (See <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref> and (Stormo et al., 1982a) for evidence that this assumption of independence is reasonable.) (3) Each of the three independent directions that a body can move in space corresponds to an independent pin. 2 (4) Each pin can be modeled by a simple harmonic oscillator. <p> The combined distribution is f (x; y) = e x 2 e y 2 , where x 2 + y 2 = r 2 . This is circularly distributed. See <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref> for further details. Theory of Molecular Machines 14 point in a three dimensional "velocity space", and the distribution of many such points is spherical. This distribution is known as the Maxwell gas distribution, since molecules of gas have the same velocity distribution. <p> The molecular operation that the ribosome must perform is to select the after sphere that represents its binding sites and to avoid all the other after spheres that represent different patterns. As we showed above, the before sphere encloses all of the after spheres <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref>. How many choices can the ribosome make for a given energy dissipation? In other words, how many after spheres can fit into the before sphere? A gumball machine is a good model for the situation (Fig. 8). <p> Notice the resemblance to equation (8). Notice also that the information measures R frequency , R sequence and C y are all different views of the same before to after state change. Because we use the same sphere geometry that Shannon did (see Appendix 2 of <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref>), we can immediately apply his theorem, which he proved geometrically (Shannon, 1949). When translated into molecular biology and applied to ribosomes, the theorem says: As long as the ribosome operates at or below its machine capacity, it can be as precise as is necessary for survival. <p> This is called "priming" the machine <ref> (Schneider, 1991a) </ref>. From the excited state, the device is guided by pre-set inputs to fall into the 0 state, and hence it must dissipate energy to the surroundings. For example, to change the state of a coin requires that we add some energy to rotate it.

Reference-contexts: The equivalent statement for molecular machines is that, so long as a molecular machine does not exceed its machine capacity, it may take actions as precise as may be required for evolutionary survival. We will sketch the proof of this amazing result.

Reference-contexts: We can clarify the problem of molecular sorting by replacing the imaginary demon with examples of real molecular machines. These biologically active molecules have the wonderful advantage that we can play with them in the laboratory to see if our models are reasonable <ref> (Schneider & Stormo, 1989) </ref>. 5. Molecular Computers The most important requirement for building a computer is a way to perform Boolean logic, since this allows one to construct logic circuits. Many molecules perform the AND function.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, information theory says that precise choices (distinguishing sites from non-sites) can be made by the appropriate combination of many "sloppy" components. Whether such precise recognition is actually done is a question which can only be answered experimentally. The bacterium Escherichia coli has approximately 2600 genes <ref> (Schneider et al., 1986) </ref>, each of which starts with a ribosome binding site. These have to be located from about 4.7 million bases of RNA which the cell can produce (Kohara et al., 1987). <p> So instead we display those patterns by using a "sequence logo" (Fig. 5), which consists of several stacks of letters. The The vertical scale is in bits (the black bar is 2 bits high) and the horizontal scale is positions across the sites. Data are from <ref> (Schneider et al., 1986) </ref>. Error bars are for the height of the stack. Coordinates are the same as in Fig. 4.

Reference-contexts: Now we start an entirely different approach. To do this it is first important to clarify the relationship between information and entropy. Shannon's information measure is based Theory of Molecular Machines 24 on the concept of uncertainty <ref> (Shannon, 1948) </ref>. The more possible distinct states that a system has, the higher the uncertainty. Since Shannon required additivity, he found that the uncertainty should be the logarithm of the number of possible states.

Reference-contexts: According to level 1 theory, molecular machines such as EcoRI are constrained in their operations by their "machine capacity", which is closely related to Claude Shannon's famous "channel capacity" <ref> (Shannon, 1949) </ref>. So long as one does not exceed the channel capacity, Shannon's theorem guarantees that one may have as few errors in communication as desired. It is this theorem which has led to spectacularly clear telephone communications and compact disk (CD) sound recordings. <p> Because we use the same sphere geometry that Shannon did (see Appendix 2 of (Schneider, 1991a)), we can immediately apply his theorem, which he proved geometrically <ref> (Shannon, 1949) </ref>. When translated into molecular biology and applied to ribosomes, the theorem says: As long as the ribosome operates at or below its machine capacity, it can be as precise as is necessary for survival.

Reference-contexts: A representation of the corresponding "key" is shown in Fig. 5. The model we are building says that: (1) The pins of the ribosome are, to a first approximation, spread linearly along a groove into which the RNA fits. (2) The pins move independently. (See (Schneider, 1991a) and <ref> (Stormo et al., 1982a) </ref> for evidence that this assumption of independence is reasonable.) (3) Each of the three independent directions that a body can move in space corresponds to an independent pin. 2 (4) Each pin can be modeled by a simple harmonic oscillator.
