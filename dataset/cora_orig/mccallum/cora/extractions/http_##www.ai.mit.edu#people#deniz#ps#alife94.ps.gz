Title: A FUTURES MARKET SIMULATION WITH NON-RATIONAL PARTICIPANTS

Abstract: This paper describes a set of experiments performed with an artificial futures market simulation. The non-rational market participants, which evolve simple strategies using genetic algorithms, compete against each other to make profits by buying and selling futures contracts. The dynamic and equilibrium behavior of the participants is studied under a variety of conditions. The results suggest that in simple markets with non-homogenous participants opportunities for making consistent profits over extended periods of time exist.

Reference-contexts: The most commonly used model for describing the behavior of market participants is called the rational expectations equilibrium model. The rational expectations model makes two assumptions <ref> [ Dornbusch and Fischer, 1987, Sargent, 1986 ] </ref> . First, market participants are rational and are able to optimize an objective function. Second, the same information is available to all market participants. In this paper both of these requirements are weakened.

Reference-contexts: The strategies of his market participants are encoded as bit-strings in which each bit corresponds to a boolean variable that is precomputed. His system features a mechanism for easily changing the risk aversion of individual participants. LeBaron notes <ref> [ Freedman, 1993 ] </ref> that even if there are regularities in real market data that can be exploited, the data might contain so much noise that the regularities are barely perceptible.

Reference-contexts: At each iteration of the simulation the best strategy (i.e., the one whose fair value is closest to the spot price) in the previous iteration becomes the visible strategy. The strategies maintained by each participant are modified and improved by a genetic algorithm <ref> [ Hol-land, 1975, Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> with traditional mutation and crossover operators. The mutation operator adds a number uniformly distributed between -.1 and .1 to a coefficient and the crossover operator is traditional single point crossover.

Reference-contexts: Linear models, for example, are much studied in econometrics and the effect of certain constraints on arbitrage opportunities is also well studied (see, e.g., <ref> [ Kolb, 1991 ] </ref> ). However, very little is known either about the dynamic or equilibrium behavior of systems in which the participants employ learning algorithms from artificial intelligence or in which the participants have grossly asymmetric information sets.

Reference-contexts: Much of their paper describes different approaches to modeling markets, but they do discuss one experiment which compares the performance of agents with different learning strategies and they conclude that adaptive agents out-perform non-adapting ones. LeBaron <ref> [ LeBaron, 1994 ] </ref> has developed a stock market simulation in which participants learn strategies using a genetic algorithm, as they do in this paper. The strategies of his market participants are encoded as bit-strings in which each bit corresponds to a boolean variable that is precomputed.

Reference-contexts: The mutation operator adds a number uniformly distributed between -.1 and .1 to a coefficient and the crossover operator is traditional single point crossover. The best strategies are selected and copied using standard proportional selection with a constant offset that ensures that all fitness values are positive <ref> [ Michalewicz, 1992 ] </ref> . The fitness values are calculated by subtracting the fair value computed by a strategy from the spot price on the next day. Experiments This section describes some experiments that suggest that when participants are asymmetric opportunities for making consistent profits exist.

Reference-contexts: Note that prices in a market in which the participants have bounded rationality and which have access to different information sets may still converge to the level predicted by rational expectations theory (for an example see <ref> [ Sargent, 1993 ] </ref> ). Thus, at a macro-level these two types of markets may be indistinguishable. An artificial futures market This section describes the framework we used for testing various hypotheses about the market.
