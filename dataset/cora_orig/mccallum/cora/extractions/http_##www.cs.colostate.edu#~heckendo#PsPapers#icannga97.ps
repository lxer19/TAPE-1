Reference-contexts: Although there are certainly easy problems with high epistasis there is a general correlation between epistasis and difficulty of solving a problem with a simple genetic algorithm. Empirical studies <ref> [2] </ref> show that functions with higher tend to have higher levels of deception and, under a simple genetic algorithm, are less frequently solved to optimality and converge to less optimal answers. <p> z) = x 2 + cos (y) sin (z) Order Without With Centering Centering 0 0.6386 0.6366 2 0.1363 0.6459 4 0.0007757 0.01548 6 2.019e-07 1.634e-05 8 1.444e-12 4.692e-10 Table 3: Walsh Sums for cos (x) and that the decoding functions for the chromosome string s are: x = s <ref> [1; 2] </ref>; y = s [3; 5]; z = s [6; 7] where the extraction function centers the argument and scales the value to the range [; ]. <p> This demonstrates that the choice of encoding length can be important and could be engineered to reduce interactions.
