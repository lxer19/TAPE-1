Abstract: H-2 The athletic department runs an intramural "knockout tournament" for 2 n tennis players as follows. In the first round, the players are paired off randomly, with each pairing being equally likely, and 2 n-1 matches are played. The winners advance to the second round, where the same process produces 2 n-2 winners. And so on; the kth round has 2 n-k randomly chosen matches between the 2 n-k+1 players who are still undefeated. The nth round produces the champion. Unbeknowst to the tournament organizers, there is actually an ordering among the players, so that player 1 is best, player 2 is second best, : : :, player 2 n is worst. When player j plays player k and j &lt; k, the winner is player j with probability p and player k with probability 1 - p, independent of the other matches. We assume that the same probability p applies to all j and k. a. What is the probability that player 1 wins the tournament? b. What is the probability that the nth round (the final match) is between the two top players, 1 and 2? c. What is the probability that the best 2 k players are the competitors in the kth-to-last round? d. Let N(n) be the number of essentially different tournament results; two tournaments are essentially the same if the matches take place between the same players and have the same winners. Prove that N(n) = 2 n !. e. What is the probability that player 2 wins the tournament? f. Prove that if 1 2 &lt; p &lt; 1, the probability that player j wins is strictly greater than the probability that player j + 1 wins, for 1 j &lt; 2 n .
