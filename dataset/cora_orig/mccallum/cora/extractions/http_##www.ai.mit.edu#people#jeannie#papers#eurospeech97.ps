Abstract: This paper reports experimental results comparing a mixed-initiative to a system-initiative dialog strategy in the context of a personal voice email agent. To independentlytest the effects of dialog strategy and user expertise, users interact with either the system-initiative or the mixed-initiative agent to perform three successive tasks which are identical for both agents. We report performance comparisons across agent strategies as well as over tasks. This evaluation utilizes and tests the PARADISE evaluation framework, and discusses the performance function derivable from the experimental data.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has emphasized the utility of mixed-initiative dialog strategies in advice-giving and diagnostic dialog domains [10, 8]. However, other work suggests that the performance of the system-initiative agent may be superior <ref> [5, 1, 6] </ref>. One reason for this is the less than perfect performance of current speech recognizers. The mixed-initiative strategy requires more complex grammars, possibly resulting in higher automatic speech recognition (ASR) error rates.

Reference-contexts: One possible source of this perception is that the SI strategy kept users busy more of the time, specifying small incremental pieces of information. This would be consistent with claims about graphical user interfaces <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus the average pace of interaction in the SI strategy would be faster, except for those interactions that finally accessedthe specified email folder or message.

Reference-contexts: Fifth, the application module preprocesses the message body for TTS to modify material not easily realized in speech <ref> [3] </ref>. Finally, the recursive structure of dialog requires EMAI to manage a stack of folders reflecting the dialog structure.

Reference-contexts: We implemented both the system-initiative and the mixed initiative versions of the email agent within a general-purpose platform for voice dialog agents, which combines ASR, text-to-speech (TTS), a phone interface, an email access application module, and modules for specifying the dialog manager and the application grammars <ref> [4] </ref>. The email application demands several advanced capabilities from these component technologies. First, ASR must support barge-in, so that the user can interrupt the agent when it is reading a long email message.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the mixed-initiative strategy may be more suitable for experienced users. However, spoken dialog agents have rarely been evaluated in the context of repeated use by a single user <ref> [7] </ref>, as would be expected in the case of an email agent. It is likely that (1) users become more expert over time; and (2) in the future systems will adapt and learn. Thus it is important to evaluate changes in performance over repeated user sessions.

Reference-contexts: It may seem obvious that the mixed-initiative strategy in D2 is preferable to the system-initiative strategy in D1. Previous work has emphasized the utility of mixed-initiative dialog strategies in advice-giving and diagnostic dialog domains <ref> [10, 8] </ref>. However, other work suggests that the performance of the system-initiative agent may be superior [5, 1, 6]. One reason for this is the less than perfect performance of current speech recognizers.
