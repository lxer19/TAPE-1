Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of planning the textual organization of instructions. We take the view that natural language generation (NLG) is a mapping process of different levels of conceptual and textual representations. Within this framework, we consider the mapping between the text's semantic representation and its rhetorical structure. We argue that such a mapping is not direct, but rather many-to-many, and give concrete examples of such a phenomenon in instructional texts. We then discuss the case of two semantic elements (called here semantic carriers), namely effects and guidances, we determine by what rhetorical relations they are most frequently realized in instructional texts, and finally, we show how such a mapping can be performed automatically within a text generation system.

Reference-contexts: if a single child is to be presented, it does not indicate an instrument and is a basic-level operation, the relation is generally seen bottom-up by a purpose in order to put the child-operation in focus (nucleus) position. 5 Evaluation As evaluation is becoming a necessary step in NLG research <ref> [Bates et al., 1994] </ref>, we have tried, to some extent, to evaluate the above claims. We believe that a formal comparison of "natural" texts and automatically generated ones (whether through an implementation or a manual run) is a sufficient but not necessary condition to evaluate 10 any NLG theory.

Reference-contexts: This step is generally performed by a task planner similar to noah [Sacerdoti, 1977] (cf. <ref> [Mellish, 1988, Dale, 1992, Vander Linden, 1993, Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref>). <p> Mapping Process III: From the semantic content of the text, the rhetorical structure is selected.

The fact that the resulting semantic and rhetorical choices seem "natural" and do not include any "strange" result leads us to believe that the above guidelines are acceptable.

Reference-contexts: They are therefore chosen more frequently by writers and allow readers to construct a conceptual representation of the procedure more easily. Our notion of basic-level operation follows the work of [Pollack, 1986] on domain-basic act-types, and not the work of <ref> [Goldman, 1970, Danto, 1973] </ref> on basic-level act-types. The choice between a purpose and a means relation to express a guidance depends on the user model (basic-level operations), the nature of the procedure and co-occurrence constraints.

Reference-contexts: The claims made here are therefore based on a corpus analysis of French instructional texts. In total, the corpus is composed of about 13,300 words. 2 Mapping Semantics onto Rhetorics In <ref> [Delin et al., 1993] </ref>, it has been argued that in a multilingual instructional text environment, the same information can be conveyed using different RST structures depending on the language of communication. <p> We have also shown how to select the most appropriate rhetorical structure to convey a semantic representation by taking the case of effects and guidances in French instructional texts. From the results of <ref> [Delin et al., 1993] </ref> it is clear that the choice of a rhetorical relation to convey some semantic element is dependent on the language of communication.

Reference-contexts: We define that a linguistic expression conveys an effect if: * it communicates a state brought about by a user 6 or a non-user operation (what is usually called a postcondition in AI planning) or * it communicates a mandatory operation O 1 that is generated (in the sense of <ref> [Goldman, 1970] </ref>) by another operation O 2 expressed in the text and O 2 does not influence how O 1 should be performed. 6 By user, we mean the main human agent of the procedure. <p> They are therefore chosen more frequently by writers and allow readers to construct a conceptual representation of the procedure more easily.

Reference-contexts: It is precisely this step that is discussed in this paper: what rhetorical relations are used to convey a semantic representation, and what contextual factors influence the choice of a preferred one. Note that when using a constructive RST text planning technique (eg, <ref> [Moore and Paris, 1988, Hovy, 1993] </ref>) steps II and III are combined into one; the content of the text is selected through rhetorical relations, thus missing a level of mapping.

Reference-contexts: More generally, many researchers have argued that within a monolingual environment the mapping between the semantic and the rhetorical levels is many-to-many <ref> [Moore and Pollack, 1992, Korelsky and Kittredge, 1993] </ref>. In order to generate high quality texts, it is necessary to have linguistically motivated guidelines on how to organize a text's content; that is how to map a semantic representation onto the most appropriate RST structure.

Reference-contexts: This step is generally performed by a task planner similar to noah [Sacerdoti, 1977] (cf. <ref> [Mellish, 1988, Dale, 1992, Vander Linden, 1993, Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref>). <p> This mapping produces a semantic representation of the instructional text. This step has not received much attention in previous work (but see for example <ref> [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref> for an attempt), probably by fear that computational linguists start from rather subjective conceptual representations of procedures. Mapping Process III: From the semantic content of the text, the rhetorical structure is selected. <p> From the semantic point of view, 8 procedural semantic carriers are typically found: sequential, co-temporal and eventual operations, options, material conditions, guidances, effects 3 and operation prevention <ref> [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref>. Except for guidances, these semantic carriers are "elements of meaning" that are mapped onto the satellite of an RST relation. <p> For example, in: (4) a. If you wish a thicker line, stay on the glass longer so that more paint can flow. 3 In <ref> [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref>, the term causality was used. 4 A c-condition combines RST's relations of circumstance and condition. It is what [Rosner and Stede, 1992] and [Vander Linden, 1993] call a precondition, but we prefer to use this term in its AI planning definition. <p> It is what [Rosner and Stede, 1992] and [Vander Linden, 1993] call a precondition, but we prefer to use this term in its AI planning definition. The relation of means refers to <ref> [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994] </ref>'s enablement. 5 We use the term operation in all levels above and including the semantic representation of the text; and the term action for all levels below. 5 purpose Preferred structure means Unlikely structure concurrency concurrency do A 2 while doing A 3 by doing A 2 <p> Indeed, the reader does not usually want to achieve an external effect but an internal one. The external effect is only a window on what is happening inside the device.

Finally the system maps this semantic structure onto a rhetorical structure by using presentation heuristics as the ones described above. To evaluate the claims, we ran texts from the training corpus through the system and qualitatively commented spin's results.

Reference-contexts: We show what many-to-many relation exists within a monolingual (French) context, we discuss the types of constraints that influence the choice of a rhetorical structure and propose a set of guidelines for the automatic selection of RST relations <ref> [Mann and Thompson, 1988] </ref>. 1 Generating Instructional Texts We view the generation of instructional texts as the mapping process of figure 1.

Reference-contexts: However, according to [Rettig, 1991], a great number of human instruction writers are not professional technical writers, but rather the technicians or engineers who developed the product to be described. These people do not generally enjoy technical writing and often do not know how to do it efficiently <ref> [Puscas, 1989] </ref>. The claims made here are therefore based on a corpus analysis of French instructional texts.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon is illustrated in figure 4. In each case, a different set of operations is chosen to be in the nucleus position as the focus, or main operation, of the instruction. To explain such a choice, we have extended the notion of basic-level categories of concrete objects of <ref> [Rosch, 1978] </ref> to categories of events. Basic-level operations are used more easily than operations at other levels of the taxonomy. Basic-level operations are the most general categories for which members have the most common properties.

Reference-contexts: Except for guidances, these semantic carriers are "elements of meaning" that are mapped onto the satellite of an RST relation. These semantic carriers are typically conveyed through 6 rhetorical relations: temporal sequence, action concurrency, means, c-condition 4 , purpose and result <ref> [Rosner and Stede, 1992, Vander Linden, 1993] </ref>. The choice of a rhetorical relation depends on several factors: The content of the semantic representation: Obviously, the most important factor in determining what rhetorical relation to use is what semantic information we wish to convey. <p> For example, in: (4) a. If you wish a thicker line, stay on the glass longer so that more paint can flow. 3 In [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994], the term causality was used. 4 A c-condition combines RST's relations of circumstance and condition.

Reference-contexts: Mapping Process I: From a conceptual representation of the world (for example, a library of uninstantiated operations schemas), some planning process selects, links and instantiates knowledge into a conceptual representation of the procedure to be described. This step is generally performed by a task planner similar to noah <ref> [Sacerdoti, 1977] </ref> (cf. [Mellish, 1988, Dale, 1992, Vander Linden, 1993, Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994]). <p> In the case at hand, to evaluate the above heuristics, we imple-mented them in a text generation system called spin 9 . This Prolog system is capable of constructing a conceptual representation of the procedure through a task planning technique similar to noah's <ref> [Sacerdoti, 1977] </ref>. spin then maps this representation onto a semantic representation of the text by applying heuristics for the selection of the text's content (see [Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994]). Finally the system maps this semantic structure onto a rhetorical structure by using presentation heuristics as the ones described above.
