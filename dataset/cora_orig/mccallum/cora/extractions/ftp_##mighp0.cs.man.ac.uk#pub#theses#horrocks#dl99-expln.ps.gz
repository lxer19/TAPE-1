Reference-contexts: Sequent calculi for ALC are well known from the modal logic literature <ref> [Fitting, 1983] </ref>: they exploit the correspondence between ALC and the multi-modal logic 1 The explanation of non-subsumption is more natural for tableaux based systems (a counter-example can be generated) but is much less interesting for users. 2 X 0 ` b ; Y 0 X 0 ; b ` Y 0

Reference-contexts: These problems can be solved using lazy unfolding and tagging. Firstly, the tableaux algorithm can use the lazy unfolding optimisation <ref> [Horrocks, 1998] </ref> so that normalisation steps are only performed as required by the progress of the tableaux expansion. Such steps can then be combined with a subsequent rule application to give a single sequent step.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The usability of Description Logic (DL) based knowledge representation systems would be considerably enhanced by the ability to explain subsump-tion inferences to non-sophisticated users [McGuinness, 1996]. Explanation is relatively natural for systems based on structural subsumption algorithms <ref> [McGuinness and Borgida, 1995] </ref>, but such algorithms are unable to deal with a more complex language such as ALC. Tableaux based systems, on the other hand, can deal with ALC (and much more complex languages), but the reasoning method does not lead to a natural explanation of subsumption inferences.

Reference-contexts: There have been already attempts (e.g., <ref> [Royer and Quantz, 1992] </ref>) to reuse standard sequent calculi from the modal logic community in Description Logics, but only with the goal of extending them with the operators which are peculiar to Description Logics|like, for example, number restrictions or ABoxes.
