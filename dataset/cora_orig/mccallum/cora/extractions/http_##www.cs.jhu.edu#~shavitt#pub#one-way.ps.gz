Abstract: Modern high speed networks (and ATM networks in particular) use resource reservation as a basic means of establishing communications. One-way on-the-fly reservation is a method for allocating resources for short bursts of data when regular reservation is too costly. The first such algorithms were recently suggested by Turner. We investigate two examples that are characteristic to the way traffic streams interact in virtual circuit networks: a three node subnetwork that also acts as a 4X2 switch and a ring. For both systems we compute system throughput under homogeneous load, and compare it with the throughput when fast reservation protocols are used. For the three node subnetwork we also give an explicit expression for an upper bound.

As for the one-way-reservation analysis, we assume zero delay on the lines.

Reference-contexts: In this work we give an exact performance analysis of one-way on-the-fly reservation algorithms and compare the results with the performance of fast-reservation protocols (FRP). Our analysis is based on modeling bursts and bandwidth on a link as customers and G/M/N/N queues, respectively <ref> [13, 7, 2] </ref>. We are able, then, to use results that were obtained from the analysis of telephone switching networks [6]. However, note that bursts that use one-way reservation do not behave as telephone calls. <p> In our analysis, we look at Markov chains that represent the state of the full system and thus avoid the need to explicitly describe the traffic out of every switch. Recently, Cho and Leon-Garcia <ref> [2] </ref> analyzed a system with only one potential congested link. Doing so lead them to erroneously state that one-way reservation and fast reservation perform equally when the propagation delay is zero. This statement is incorrect when more then a single link can potentially be congested. <p> However, enhancements to this scheme [4] can increase its performance and make it more appealing for use. The comparison between the two types of reservation protocols shows an advantage for the FRP when the delay on the lines is zero contradicting Cho and Leon-Garcia <ref> [2] </ref> claims. Future work is required to compare the two reservation schemes when line delay is accurately accommodated into the model.

Reference-contexts: For states where l + m = N , link 1 is full, thus, only two of the above four arrival transitions are valid (with rate ). Using the above we can write the elements of the transition rate matrix, Q (see <ref> [3] </ref>) and calculate the steady state probabilities hi;j;l;mi using the relation: ~Q = 0 (2) and the probability conservation relation: X li; mj; l+mN where ~ is the vector of steady state probabilities. <p> Note that due to system symmetry, i;j (s) = j;i (s) for all i and j. We clearly have (s) = i=0 N X p j i;j (s) (6) where i;j (s) are computed by the solution of an (N + 1) 2 matrix equation (see <ref> [3] </ref>). <p> This enables us to solve a continuous time Markov chain with only (N + 1) 3 states (see <ref> [3] </ref> for the elements of Q). <p> As for the one-way-reservation analysis, we assume zero delay on the lines.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that it is more suitable for the case where the burst size is small compared to the available throughput or when the system load is low. However, enhancements to this scheme <ref> [4] </ref> can increase its performance and make it more appealing for use. The comparison between the two types of reservation protocols shows an advantage for the FRP when the delay on the lines is zero contradicting Cho and Leon-Garcia [2] claims.

Reference-contexts: However, if several bursts arrive to an ATM switch at the same time and compete for buffers they may disturb each other. To avoid this, Turner <ref> [12] </ref> suggested to use one-way on-the-fly reservation. In his scheme, a burst that arrives to an ATM switch and finds a sufficient number of buffers reserves the required buffer space to prevent disturbance from new coming bursts. This process is repeated in every switch along the burst route.

Reference-contexts: There is also no mechanism to release immediately the partial bandwidth already reserved (see below). The same solution does not fit longer bursts. Here, the overhead of reservation is not as bothersome so two-way reservation algorithms can be used. Widjaja <ref> [13] </ref> computed the break-even point where the performance of the two schemes is equal. In this work we give an exact performance analysis of one-way on-the-fly reservation algorithms and compare the results with the performance of fast-reservation protocols (FRP). <p> In this work we give an exact performance analysis of one-way on-the-fly reservation algorithms and compare the results with the performance of fast-reservation protocols (FRP). Our analysis is based on modeling bursts and bandwidth on a link as customers and G/M/N/N queues, respectively <ref> [13, 7, 2] </ref>. We are able, then, to use results that were obtained from the analysis of telephone switching networks [6]. However, note that bursts that use one-way reservation do not behave as telephone calls. <p> The main difficulty in using results from the telephony model is that the process that describes the traffic out of a telephone switch (a link in our case), the carried traffic in telephony jargon, is not a renewal process. Widjaja <ref> [13] </ref> bypassed this difficulty by assuming that the rejection probabilities in the links along the burst route are independent. We show in section 3 that this assumption is incorrect, and demonstrate the inaccuracies that result from such an assumption. <p> This means that bursts that have already captured a server have higher probability of capturing a second server compared to bursts that come from the outside, which contradicts Widjaja's assumption <ref> [13] </ref> that the probability of capturing a server is constant along the burst route. This route (N=4, h=4). probability increases because the traffic carried on a link becomes smoother at every stage. The smoothing is most apparent in the first stage as depicted in Figure 7.
