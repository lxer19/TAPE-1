Title: A Caching DHCP Relay Agent  
Author: Patrick H. Fry Joshua W. Knight 
Abstract: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol[2] (DHCP) is an increasingly popular method for providing configuration information to network hosts. In large-scale enterprise and/or geographically dispersed networks it is useful to provide continuous, reliable DHCP service while minimizing the number of DHCP servers. This paper describes the Caching DHCP Relay Agent (CDRA) which can reduce the workload of a DHCP server and provide DHCP services during server failures. The CDRA requires minimal configuration and management. Three different types of CDRAs are introduced; one of which, the proxying CDRA, was implemented by modifying the existing DHCP relay agent code for the IBM AIX operating system.

Reference-contexts: The relay must change this entry to its own IP address before forwarding to the client. If the relay is performing automated lease renewals, then the configuration information relative to the leases (ie. IP Address Lease Time, Renewal (T1) Time Value, and Rebinding (T2) Time Value <ref> [1] </ref>) must also be modified before forwarding to the client. Finally, when a client sends a DHCPREQUEST in response to a DHCPOFFER, it must include the Server Identifier option. This option will contain the address of the relay.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol <ref> [2] </ref> (DHCP) is an increasingly popular method for providing configuration information to network hosts. In large-scale enterprise and/or geographically dispersed networks it is useful to provide continuous, reliable DHCP service while minimizing the number of DHCP servers. <p> For example, a "safe network mode" option could be used in the CDRA's configuration file. Our CDRA implementation has this capability. 3.2 Precautions Before Responding to Client Requests Of the five types of client DHCP messages <ref> [2] </ref>, only one, the DHCPREQUEST, requires special precautions when being handled by a CDRA. The DHCPREQUEST message is used to request a lease on an IP address or renew and existing lease. <p> Also, if the spoofing CDRA fails and there's an alternative path from a client to the server, the client can still renew its lease. If a proxying CDRA fails, none of its clients will renew their lease until entering the REBIND <ref> [2] </ref> stage because they think their server is the proxying CDRA. 5 4.3 Address Pooling CDRA The address pooling CDRA acts more like a server than a relay agent. On startup, a pool of IP addresses are requested from the real DHCP server. <p> The database contains the following information : * ClientID: Unique identifier based on NIC information (hardware address and type of interface) * ClientType: DHCP or BOOTP * State: State of client. Based on the possible states a client can be in as described in <ref> [2] </ref> * ServAddr: IP address of the client's server * CliAddr: IP address of the client * LeaseTime: Length of lease * LeaseStartTime: Time (local to relay) when the lease started * LastContact: Last time the relay received a message from the client * LastUpdate: Last time configuration information was refreshed <p> The different possible states are roughly synonymous to those shown in Figure 5 of <ref> [2] </ref> with some shoehorning for BOOTP clients. The relay determines the client's state based on the last message to/from the client. For example, suppose the client sent a lease renewal REQUEST to the relay. <p> The relay could convert this REQUESTING DHCPREQUEST to a REBOOTING DHCPREQUEST and forward it to the server. This saves the server from having to process the DHCPDISCOVER. The worst case scenario is that the server respond with a NAK and the client has to reissue a DISCOVER. See <ref> [2] </ref> for more details about different methods of client initialization. Another reason for keeping the expired data has to do with temporary loss of connectivity with the server. If the server is unreachable, the relay could give the client its old expired IP address if requested.

Reference-contexts: One method is to run the DHCP services on a high availability system (e.g. IBM S/390). Another option is to use a pool of redundant DHCP servers. If a server fails, other servers are available to take over. Currently, two competing Internet Drafts, [5] and <ref> [3] </ref>, define a communication protocol between a pool of peer DHCP servers. A CDRA offers a third approach. If a DHCP server fails, the CDRA is capable of providing some services to its clients until the server returns.
