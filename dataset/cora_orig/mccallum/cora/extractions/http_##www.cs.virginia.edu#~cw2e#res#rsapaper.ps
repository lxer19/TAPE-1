Reference-contexts: We demonstrate in this paper how to build these capabilities into an electronic mail system. At the heart of our proposal is a new encryption method. This method provides an implementation of a "public-key cryptosystem," an elegant concept invented by Diffie and Hellman <ref> [1] </ref>. Their article motivated our research, since they presented the concept but not any practical implementation of such a system. Readers familiar with [1] may wish to skip directly to Section V for a description of our method. <p> This method provides an implementation of a "public-key cryptosystem," an elegant concept invented by Diffie and Hellman <ref> [1] </ref>.

Readers familiar with [1] may wish to skip directly to Section V for a description of our method. II Public-Key Cryptosystems In a "public key cryptosystem" each user places in a public file an encryption procedure E. That is, the public file is a directory giving the encryption procedure of each user. <p> If property (c) is satisfied the number of such messages to test will be so large that this approach is impractical. A function E satisfying (a)-(c) is a "trap-door one-way function;" if it also satisfies (d) it is a "trap-door one-way permutation." Diffie and Hellman <ref> [1] </ref> introduced the concept of trap-door one-way functions but did not present any examples. These functions are called "one-way" because they are easy to compute in one direction but (apparently) very difficult to compute in the other direction. <p> Property (d) is needed only to implement "signatures." The reader is encouraged to read Diffie and Hellman's excellent article <ref> [1] </ref> for further background, for elaboration of the concept of a public-key cryptosystem, and for a discussion of other problems in the area of cryptography. <p> Section VII shows how each of the above operations can be done efficiently. The aforementioned method should not be confused with the "exponentiation" technique presented by Diffie and Hellman <ref> [1] </ref> to solve the key distribution problem. Their technique permits two users to determine a key in common to be used in a normal cryptographic system. It is not based on a trap-door one-way permutation.

Reference-contexts: The NBS standard was "certified" this way; seventeen man-years at IBM were spent fruitlessly trying to break that scheme. Once a method has successfully resisted such a concerted attack it may for practical purposes be considered secure. (Actually there is some controversy concerning the security of the NBS method <ref> [2] </ref>.) We show in the next sections that all the obvious approaches for breaking our system are at least as difficult as factoring n.

Reference-contexts: Step 4. Halt. Now C is the encrypted form of M . This procedure is called "exponentiation by repeated squaring and multiplication." This procedure is half as good as the best; more efficient procedures are known. Knuth <ref> [3] </ref> studies this problem in detail. <p> D How to Compute e from d and (n) To compute e, use the following variation of Euclid's algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of (n) and d. (See exercise 4.5.2.15 in <ref> [3] </ref>.) Calculate gcd ((n); d) by computing a series x 0 ; x 1 ; x 2 ; : : :, where x 0 (n); x 1 = d, and x i+1 x i1 (mod x i ), until an x k equal to 0 is found. <p> The factors of n enable him to compute (n) and thus d. Fortunately, factoring a number seems to be much more difficult than determining whether it is prime or composite. A large number of factoring algorithms exist. Knuth <ref> [3, Section 4.5.4] </ref> gives an excellent presentation of many of them. Pollard [9] presents an algorithm which factors a number n in time O (n 1=4 ).

Reference-contexts: Reblocking to encipher a signed message is then unnecessary; the message is blocked according to the transmitter's signature n. Another solution uses a technique given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Each user has a single (e; n) pair where n is between h and 2h, where h is a threshold as above.

Reference-contexts: An intruder listening in on the channel cannot decipher any messages, since it is not possible to derive the decryption keys from the encryption keys. (We assume that the intruder cannot modify or insert messages into the channel.) Ralph Merkle has developed another solution <ref> [5] </ref> to this problem. A public-key cryptosystem can be used to "bootstrap" into a standard encryption scheme such as the NBS method. Once secure communications have been established, the first message transmitted can be a key to use in the NBS scheme to encode all following messages.

Reference-contexts: This approach to factoring has also not turned out to be fruitful. A knowledge of d enables n to be factored as follows. Once a cryptanalyst knows d he can calculate e d 1, which is a multiple of (n). Miller <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that n can be factored using any multiple of (n).

If b is prime (6) is always true. If b is composite (6) will be false with probability at least 1=2.

We demonstrate in this paper how to build these capabilities into an electronic mail system.
