Abstract: This NRL NCARAI technical note (AIC-95-003) describes work with Salzberg's (1991) NGE. I recently implemented this algorithm and have run a few case studies. The purpose of this note is to publicize this implementation and note a curious result while using it. This implementation of NGE is available at under my WWW address

Reference-contexts: The namesfile describes the set of attributes. Examples are given in the software package. It is similar to the C4.5 format <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref>, but not identical. Instances are assumed to be on one line, with the class attribute listed last. Attributes can be separated by commas or spaces. The namesfile contains one line per attribute.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, a simple question for future research concerns why these two interpretations prefer such different values for the feature adjustment rate. Zhang's algorithm, an extension of the one reported in <ref> (Zhang, 1994) </ref>, was designed to learn "m-of-n" concepts. Its accuracy is approximately 99% on this task. Four other applications of NGE are contained in the software package. 5 Summary The purpose of this brief note is to publicize the existence of this software implementation of NGE.
