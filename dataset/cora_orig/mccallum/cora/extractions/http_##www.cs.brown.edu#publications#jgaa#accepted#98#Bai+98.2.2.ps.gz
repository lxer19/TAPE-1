Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed broadcasting algorithm with optimal time complexity and without message redundancy for one-to-all broadcasting in the one-port communication model on arrangement graph interconnection networks. The algorithm exploits the hierarchical property of the arrangement graph to construct different-sized broadcasting trees for different-sized subgraphs. These different-sized broadcasting trees constitute a spanning tree on the arrangement graph. Every processor individually performs its broadcasting procedure based on the spanning tree. It is shown that a message can be broadcast to all the other n!

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The star graph <ref> [1] </ref> is one of the widely studied interconnection network topologies. It has been proposed as an attractive alternative to the hypercube with many superior characteristics. A major practical difficulty with the star graph is related to its number of nodes: n! for the nstar graph.

Reference-contexts: In [12], Sheu, Wu and Chen proposed a broadcasting algorithm that broadcasts a message to all nodes in the star graph at the optimal time based on the algorithm in [9]. It also performs broadcasting without redundant messages. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Bai, Yamakawa, Ebara and Nakano proposed a broadcasting algorithm in the one-port commu L.

It can broadcast a message to all nodes in optimal time. <p> one of the nodes in each of n l node-disjoint subgraphs A l+1 n;k of A l n;k (F irst l (p)) and then making each of the nodes that received broadcast the message on the given lower level subgraph, a broadcasting algorithm with optimal time has been proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. This algorithm embeds the intermediate nodes in a broadcasting tree to achieve a broadcasting procedure with the optimal time complexity. But it is not optimal in the message complexity.

Reference-contexts: A major practical difficulty with the star graph is related to its number of nodes: n! for the nstar graph. Recently, a new interconnection network topology called the (n; k)-arrangement graph has been proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. This topology is a generalized class of star graphs in the sense that a star graph is a special arrangement graph, and presents a cure for the design drawback of the star graph. <p> These nodes form a subgraph of A n;k . The arrangement graph still has many other good characteristics. For a more thorough coverage of the arrangement graph, refer to <ref> [5] </ref>. As shown in Definition 1, there are n k elements that are not used in permutation p. We define the label p out of the node p to denote these elements.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it is desirable to develop a broadcasting algorithm that optimizes both the time complexity and the message complexity. The broadcasting problems on the hypercube and the star graph have been investigated in recent years. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Johnsson and Ho presented three new communication graphs for hypercubes and defined scheduling disciplines, so that the communication tasks are completed within a small constant factor of the best known lower bounds. In [11], Sheu, Liaw and Chen presented a distributed broadcasting algorithm without message redundantly in star graphs.

Reference-contexts: At any given time, a node can communicate with at most one of its adjacent nodes. There are no faults on the arrangement graph. Theorem 1 <ref> [10] </ref> If an interconnection network consists of N nodes or processors that can communicate with at most one of its adjacent nodes at any given time, then any one-to-all broadcasting algorithm on the network must take at least (lg N ) steps.
