Abstract: Dynamic vehicle routing and dispatching refers to a wide range of problems where information on the problem is revealed to the decision maker concurrently with the determination of the solution. These problems have recently emerged as an active area of research due to recent technological advances that allow real-time information to be quickly obtained and processed. There are probably as many variants of these problems as there are real-world applications. After a brief overview of this broad domain, the paper will then focus on problems motivated by courier services and demand responsive transportation systems. These systems typically evolve within a local service area over a relatively short period of time (typically, a few hours), thus putting stringent response time requirements on the decision maker. They are also characterized by a strong routing component: many tasks can be allocated at once to the same vehicle and these tasks must be appropriately sequenced. The paper surveys relevant work in the scientific literature on such problems, presents recent results and advances in our on-going research efforts, and proposes open directions for future research.

The implementation follows a master-slave scheme where the master manages the adaptive memory and the slaves run the tabu search. A two-level parallelization scheme is observed.

Thus, customers are clustered in groups of size q before a vehicle is dispatched to them.

Reference-contexts: Although dynamic vehicle routing and dispatching is a subclass of a broader domain called dynamic transportation (which includes fleet management, facility location, traffic assignment, air traffic control and many others, see <ref> [9] </ref>), it is itself a broad domain with a variety of problems. A first distinction can be made on the basis of the dispatching area, which could be either local (e.g., within an urban area), regional, national or international.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [11] </ref>, the tabu search heuristic presented in Section 1.3 for the courier service is extended to address two-point requests. In this case, the neighborhood structure is redefined, as a CROSS exchange can easily split the pick-up and delivery locations associated with a given request on two different routes. <p> Ideas along these lines have already been proposed in [13, 26, 35]. Clearly, the neighborhood defined by such ejection chains can be quite large. A shortest path algorithm is thus proposed in <ref> [11] </ref> to find the best ejection chain over a restricted portion of the entire neighborhood. In [31], a computer assistant for vehicle dispatching with a learning module is developed for the same type of application.

Reference-contexts: The ejection chain can be of any arbitrary length, although it must be elementary (i.e. it cannot come back to a previous route to eject another request from that route).

Reference-contexts: A new starting solution is constructed by selecting and combining routes taken from different solutions in the adaptive memory [27]. This way of creating new solutions is similar in spirit to the crossover operators found in genetic algorithm <ref> [15] </ref>, although the number of "parent" solutions can be larger than two. The tabu search algorithm is further enhanced through a decomposition procedure where each problem (set of routes) is partitioned into a number of subproblems (subsets of routes), using a sweep heuristic.

Reference-contexts: Thus, customers are clustered in groups of size q before a vehicle is dispatched to them. A similar analytic work has also been performed in the case of a single vehicle problem with pick-ups and deliveries <ref> [20] </ref>. Unfortunately, a thorough mathematical analysis is seldom possible in real-world settings. Ad hoc algorithmic techniques are thus applied, as in the dial-a-ride systems of Section 1.2 and in the repair application presented above, to tell the vehicle what its next destination (s) should be.

As in <ref> [23] </ref>, the algorithm developed for the static case is applied each time an input update occurs. Two different types of events are taken care of: the occurrence of a new service request and the arrival of a vehicle at a customer location.

Reference-contexts: Note that the presence of time windows is a natural way to preclude such indefinite deferment. A military sealift emergency problem is addressed in <ref> [24] </ref>, where cargoes are moved by ship between a number of ports to optimize a prescribed measure of system performance under various operating constraints, in particular time window constraints on pick-up and delivery. The main contribution of this work is in the innovative exploitation of a rolling time horizon. <p> Finally, a time window is assigned to the customer with the objective of balancing the load among the time slices. This application is to be contrasted with academic problems known as the Dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) <ref> [24] </ref> and the Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (DTRP) [4] where the service requests must be serviced as soon as possible after their occurrence.

An alternative approach is proposed in <ref> [31] </ref>, as the authors do not try to define any "realistic" objective function. Rather, they mimic the dispatcher's decision behavior, using a learning algorithm that exploits previous decisions taken by this dispatcher. <p> Ideas along these lines have already been proposed in [13, 26, 35]. Clearly, the neighborhood defined by such ejection chains can be quite large. A shortest path algorithm is thus proposed in [11] to find the best ejection chain over a restricted portion of the entire neighborhood. In <ref> [31] </ref>, a computer assistant for vehicle dispatching with a learning module is developed for the same type of application. This work departs from classical operations research approaches as the authors do not apply optimization techniques to minimize or maximize an objective function.

Reference-contexts: By raising this penalty, the authors were able to improve previous solutions reported in the literature on some static problems with hard time windows taken from Solomon's test set <ref> [32] </ref>. DYNAMIC VEHICLE ROUTING AND DISPATCHING 9 A parallel implementation of this algorithm on a network of SUN Ultra-SPARC workstations is reported in [1]. The implementation follows a master-slave scheme where the master manages the adaptive memory and the slaves run the tabu search. A two-level parallelization scheme is observed.

Reference-contexts: A distinct tabu search is then applied to each subproblem. At the end, the resulting routes are merged back to form the final solution. Through this decomposition approach, the tabu search works on much smaller problems, thus allowing a more focused search <ref> [33] </ref>. The objective chosen by the authors consists of minimizing the total distance traveled plus a penalty for lateness at customer locations.

The tabu search exploits a neighborhood based on CROSS exchanges that extends previously developed exchange methods for problems with time windows. Using a pair of routes in the current solution, a sequence of consecutive customer locations, which can be of any arbitrary length, is first selected on each route.

Reference-contexts: The ejection chain can be of any arbitrary length, although it must be elementary (i.e. it cannot come back to a previous route to eject another request from that route).
