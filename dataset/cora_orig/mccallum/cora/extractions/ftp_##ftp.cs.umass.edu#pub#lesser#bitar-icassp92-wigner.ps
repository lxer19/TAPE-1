Abstract: In this paper, we describe and demonstrate how the combined use of Wigner and STFT processing can be used to advantage in a sound understanding application. Specifically, the Wigner processing of a signal is used for alerting the signal understanding system to the possibility of inadequate time or frequency resolution in the STFT processing of the same signal. The signal understanding system may then reprocess the signal with an STFT with a different window length. The knowledge-based control required for carrying out such signal processing is available in a sound understanding system in the context of which this research was carried out.

Reference-contexts: In our research on sound understanding, we have found that time-frequency analysis is best carried out through a combined use of STFT <ref> [1] </ref> and Wigner [2] processing. The need for combined use of the two techniques arises because each technique by itself cannot adequately meet the signal processing requirements of the application domain.

The need for combined use of the two techniques arises because each technique by itself cannot adequately meet the signal processing requirements of the application domain. Since most sounds are multi-component signals, Wigner processing gives rise to significant "cross-terms" which make interpretation of its output data very difficult. <p> We focus only on those properties of these time-frequency transforms that are relevant to the remaining sections of this paper. The Wigner distribution (WD) <ref> [2] </ref> of a discrete-time signal x (n) is defined as W D x (n; !) = m=1 A useful property of the WD is that unlike the STFT its resolution in time and frequency is not dependent upon any windowing operation.

Reference-contexts: Since most sounds are multi-component signals, Wigner processing gives rise to significant "cross-terms" which make interpretation of its output data very difficult. STFT processing has significantly diminished cross-terms but at the expense of decreased time or frequency resolution. As detailed in <ref> [3] </ref> and [4], the time and frequency resolution requirements in a sound understanding application rule out the possibility of using STFT processing with a fixed analysis window length for all possible input signals in that domain.

Reference-contexts: The knowledge-based control necessary for this purpose is provided by a particular signal understanding architecture <ref> [5] </ref> that was designed to provide the capability of situation-dependent signal processing. In section 2, we provide a brief overview of the main features of STFT and Wigner processing which are relevant to the research results reported in this paper.

Reference-contexts: However, the WD also has an undesirable property for applications involving multicomponent signals. When the WD is applied to a multi-component signal, the resulting transform consists of "auto-terms" and "cross-terms" <ref> [6] </ref>. The auto-terms are created in the time-frequency regions corresponding to the actual signal components. Each cross-term lies at the intermediate frequency between any two signal components. <p> The tradeoff between frequency resolution and time resolution is determined by the length of the analysis window. Longer window lengths give better frequency resolution while shorter window lengths give better time resolution. Another impotrtant property of the STFT arises from its relationship to the WD. It is well-known <ref> [6] </ref> that the magnitude squared of the STFT of a signal is a low-pass filtered version of the signal's WD.

Reference-contexts: Since the cross-terms of the WD are generally more oscillatory than the auto-terms, the cross-terms tend to be diminished relative to the auto-terms as a consequence of this filtering operation. 3 Discrepancy Detection We have devised two procedures <ref> [7] </ref> for determining from the Wigner output the possibility that some of the signal components of significant duration and energy have time or frequency resolution requirements that cannot be met by the current STFT processing. <p> To capture this slope, STFT reprocessing was performed with a 256 point window. The result is shown in figure 3 (c), which is consistent with the transient behavior expected for the sound of a hairdryer being turned on <ref> [7] </ref>. In a second experiment, we applied the time resolution procedure of the previous section to the sound of a telephone ring. None of the detected contours had a slope greater than the maximum slope that can be correctly processed by the initial STFT processing.

Reference-contexts: This reprocessing need only be carried out in the frequency region of width F res within which the peak-pairs are detected by the Wigner analysis. We have devised a com-putationally efficient procedure <ref> [8] </ref> for carrying out this reprocessing over narrow frequency regions. The procedure utilizes a Taylor series expansion approach [9] instead of the FFT approach for computing the frequency slices of the STFT. 3.2 Time Resolution Procedure 1.
