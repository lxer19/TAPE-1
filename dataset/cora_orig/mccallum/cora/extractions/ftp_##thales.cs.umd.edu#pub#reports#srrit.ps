Abstract: SRRIT is a FORTRAN program to calculate an approximate orthonor-mal basis for a dominant invariant subspace of a real matrix A by the method of simultaneous iteration [12]. Specifically, given an integer m, SRRIT attempts to compute a matrix Q with m orthonormal columns and real quasi-triangular matrix T of order m such that the equation fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports.

Reference-contexts: If explicit eigenvectors are desired, they may be obtained by evaluating the eigenvectors of T and appling (2). The program STREVC in LAPACK <ref> [1] </ref> will evaluate the eigenvectors of a quasi-triangular matrix. 4 SRRIT: Simultaneous Iteration 2. Usage SRRIT is a subroutine in ANSI FORTRAN 77 to calculate the basis for Q m described in Section 1.

Reference-contexts: It is essentially the same as the program HQR3 [13]. However, instead of using QR iteration to do the diagonal swapping in HQR3, SLAQR3 uses a direct swapping method <ref> [2] </ref>. 6. Numerical Experiments The program described above has been tested on a number of problems. In this section, we give three examples that illustrate the flexibility of the method and its ability to deal with equimodular or clustered eigenvalues.

Reference-contexts: Method The Schur vectors Q of A are computed by a variant of simultaneous iteration, which is a generalization of the power method for finding the dominant eigenvector of a matrix.

Reference-contexts: The blocks of quasi-triangular forms are ordered so that the eigenvalues appear in descending order of absolute value along the diagonal. The decomposition produced by SLAQR3 differs from the one produced by EISPACK subroutine HQR <ref> [9] </ref> or LAPACK subroutine SHSEQR in that the eigenvalues of the final quasi-triangular matrix are ordered. It is essentially the same as the program HQR3 [13]. However, instead of using QR iteration to do the diagonal swapping in HQR3, SLAQR3 uses a direct swapping method [2]. 6.

Reference-contexts: This arrangement enables us to work entirely with real numbers, even when some of the eigenvalues of T are complex. The existence of such a decomposition is a consequence of Schur's theorem <ref> [11] </ref>. The eigenvalues of the matrix T computed by the program appear in descending order of magnitude along its diagonal.
