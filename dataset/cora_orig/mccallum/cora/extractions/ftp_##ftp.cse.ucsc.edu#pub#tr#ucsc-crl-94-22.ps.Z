Abstract: This short report describes progress on the Morph Adaptive Pattern-Oriented chess system over the last four years and describes ongoing work on Morph II, a domain-independent machine learning system and problem-solver. Morph II, is a direct generalization of the original Morph model and incorporates significant improvements to all aspects of the original system. The Universal Agent (Morph II) falls directly within the hierarchical reinforcement learning paradigm that has been gaining popularity in the last few years, but goes beyond: in this learning model, the system is responsible for abstracting its own features and patterns, developing its own learning modules, and employing transformations on the representations used. In essence the system is learning neurally (through weight propagation), genetically (through pattern evolution) and symbolically (through its own abstractions). Still, the system maintains uniformity, in that each module at any level of the hierarchy is an instantiation of the same learning strategy. This report describes the motivations and philosophy behind MorphII, outlines current and future performance objectives, and discusses the potential impact of this new technology.

Reference-contexts: We believe that similar mathematical constructions can be applied to all search problems that can be stated as games of abstract mathematical relations.

Reference-contexts: Our investigation is to study the best means of applying the mathematical transformations without yielding to the combinatorial explosion of brute force or genetic algorithms or the arbitrariness of supplying a set of "methods" <ref> [19] </ref> but based on developing the system's understanding of how patterns are leading to misevaluations in a given domain and deliberately constructing new pattern types to alleviate those difficulties.

Reference-contexts: Lenat's AM "automated mathematician" [21] can be viewed as a serious and exciting attempt to get the machine to behave as a mathematician by supplying heuristics, constructs and discovery algorithms similar to those employed by mathematicians. It was, however, admitted that much of AM and Eurisko's <ref> [20] </ref> success was dependent on the applicability of Lisp-like representation to the domain under study [22]. A similar complaint could be made of the original Morph system: its human-supplied graph representation is ideally suited for chess. With MorphII we are going deeper than this.

Reference-contexts: Three exciting and unforeseen developments took place in the first year or so of the second project. First was the development of strongly optimized methods for the associative retrieval of semantic networks (SNs). These methods (significant extensions to earlier work <ref> [23] </ref>) were published in the paper "Pattern Associativity and the Retrieval of Semantic Networks" [24], and have been enhanced and verified since. These methods allow APS-like associative pattern retrieval to require graph matching on only a small fraction of the database.

Thus, for instance, it is unable to learn whether two rooks are diagonally related or whether a rook is out an edge.

Reference-contexts: See below. * Fully-recursive analogical pattern creation and matching. In a recent article <ref> [39] </ref> Eduardo Morales points out limitations of the old Morph system: Learning from recorded games is a natural way to learn chess. Morph already claims to do so, using a fixed set of relations between the pieces [30]. Morph, however, is limited to learning patterns that express attacking/defensive relations.

Reference-contexts: In support of this line of research, Callan and Utgoff [2] have shown how useful features can be derived directly from the declarative definition of the rules of a given domain. Barney Pell goes further in a recent paper <ref> [42] </ref> by demonstrating how entire heuristics (features and values) can be developed from rule analysis. 3.6 General Function Learning MorphII can be viewed as a general algorithm for function learning if one ignores the difficulty of assigning weights to individual states in a game (the role of temporal 3.

Reference-contexts: By viewing things at the mathematical (domain-independent) level we hope to uncover the principles that guide intelligent search. A number of planning and hierarchical planning algorithms originating conceptually in Means-Ends-Analysis [11], Abstrips <ref> [47] </ref> and TWEAK [3] require prioritizing the operators and conditions (or subgoals) in the domain. Such evaluation normally requires human application of domain-dependent knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Second, two other methods for acquiring domain knowledge are possible: a. Experiential/reinforcement learning. Such an approach has been popular in recent years <ref> [59] </ref>. b. Heuristic construction through analysis of the structure of the problem domain itself. This method has been largely ignored. In fact, many of the efforts in AI can be viewed as consciously or unconsciously avoiding consideration of the mathematics of the problem domain.
