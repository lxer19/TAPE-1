Title: Target tracking method based on a comparison between an image and a model  
Author: Rafael Murrieta-Cid 
Abstract: This report describes a method to track moving non-rigid objects. The method is based on a comparison between a model and an image, the comparison function employed is the partial Hausdorff distance. The model and the image are binary elements extracted from a sequence of gray levels images. The target's motion in a two-dimensional representation (image) is decomposed into two parts: a two-dimensional motion, corresponding to the change in the target's position in the image space and a two-dimensional shape change, corresponding to a new aspect of the target.

Reference-contexts: In addition, this technique allows the program to report the target's location to any external systems with a higher frequency (for an application see <ref> [1] </ref>). * Instead of computing the set of translations of M t , such that h k1 (M t ; I t+1 ) is no larger than some value t , we are finding simply the first translation whose h k1 (M t ; I t+1 ) is less than t
