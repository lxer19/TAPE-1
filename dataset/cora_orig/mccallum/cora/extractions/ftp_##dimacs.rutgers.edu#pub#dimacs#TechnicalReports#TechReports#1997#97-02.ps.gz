Reference-contexts: The problems of determining appropriate link capacities and finding optimal locations for the switching equipment to implement this approach are among the most challenging of those encountered by the authors. (See [San94] <ref> [BCM94] </ref> [SDC94] for examples.) In a third approach, the demand locations are partitioned into sets called "communities" and protection capacity is dedicated to each community. That is, the demands within each community share protection capacity allocated to the community as a whole.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [CDSW95] </ref> the authors describe the SONET Toolkit, which is a decision support system for providing survivability in SONET networks that was developed at Bellcore. The system includes various mechanisms for providing survivability, but it relies heavily on ring deployment for cost-effectiveness. <p> DRSP is a computationally difficult problem. A proof of the following result mimics the one in [CS94]. Theorem 1: DRSP is NP-hard. Theorem 1, combined with the fact that the ring sizing component of a planning tool like the SONET Toolkit <ref> [CDSW95] </ref> may be called thousands of times during a network planning session, makes heuristic methods a natural (and warranted) way to proceed. Several variations of the DRSP model may arise because of differing assumptions about the capabilities of equipment being represented or because of different requirements on the solution.

Reference-contexts: A second constraint that is often imposed by telecommunication carriers dictates that demands cannot be "split" in their routing. That is, they must be routed entirely clockwise or counterclockwise on the ring. The Ring Loading Problem, studied by <ref> [CS94] </ref> and [SSW95], is the variant of the ring sizing problem that forbids the splitting of demands but does not impose slot assignments. The DRSP formulation that we now state includes both types of constraints. 3.1. <p> Alternative formulations may include additional constraints that strengthen the formulation for linear programming-based solution methods, but these issues are not addressed in this paper.

Routing based on the Linear Relaxation Problem In the context of SONET Ring technology, various approaches to demand routing have been investigated <ref> [CS94] </ref>, [SSW95], [VSKW96]. Each of them solves some relaxation of DRSP that does not include slotting, but the solutions obtained by these methods may still be of use in constructing DRSP solutions. In the remainder of this section, we consider two such methods. <p> The Loading problem is described in detail in <ref> [CS94] </ref> and [SSW95]. It is NP-Hard, but some reasonable heuristics are available.

The Loading problem can be used in a heuristic approach to DRSP because one can assume that a routing of demands that minimizes link loads would be likely to require a relatively small number of slots as well.

Reference-contexts: Our paper focuses on the resulting ring sizing problem. Ring sizing issues have recently been considered by several 2 authors ([CS94], [SSW95], [VSKW95]), but without the socalled slotting constraints that we consider here (and discussed in <ref> [CCS94] </ref>). These constraints better-model the way that most current equipment utilize ring capacity to satisfy demands. In this paper, we formulate the Demand Routing and Slotting Problem [DRSP] that includes these constraints, and we discuss a variety of heuristic methods that provide feasible solutions with good quality guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Once a weighting is established, the routing for each demand becomes fixed and is independent of the routing of other demands. Thus, weight-based routing is an online method for routing. If we combine edge-avoidance routing with an online scheme for interval graph coloring <ref> [KT81] </ref>, we have an online method for obtaining DRSP solutions. Online algorithms for interval graph coloring can be guaranteed to deliver solutions that use no more than 3 times the optimal number of colors, which is best possible [KT81]. <p> we combine edge-avoidance routing with an online scheme for interval graph coloring <ref> [KT81] </ref>, we have an online method for obtaining DRSP solutions.

Reference-contexts: Since edge-avoidance guarantees that the resulting interval graph has a maximum load of no more than 2z*, the combined approach delivers a solution to DRSP that uses no more than 6z* slots. 21 We can also combine more general weight-based routings with an online algorithm for circular arc graph coloring <ref> [MHR93] </ref> to obtain a second online approach for DRSP. The CAG coloring algorithm [MHR93], however is only guaranteed to deliver a solution that is within a factor of 4 of the optimal. <p> no more than 2z*, the combined approach delivers a solution to DRSP that uses no more than 6z* slots. 21 We can also combine more general weight-based routings with an online algorithm for circular arc graph coloring <ref> [MHR93] </ref> to obtain a second online approach for DRSP.

Reference-contexts: Although implementing such features may be expensive, it is thought to be a cost effective alternative to relying on a network that has a high potential for service disruption <ref> [NYT] </ref>. Service providers that do not offer guarantees that their networks are protected from unforeseen circumstances are likely to lose clients to competitors who do. In the next section, we provide a brief overview of popular methods for protecting network traffic.

Reference-contexts: To do this in the most cost-effective manner, the demands must be packed onto a ring with the smallest possible capacity. Our paper focuses on the resulting ring sizing problem.

We begin by introducing a property that, in fact, guarantees the result. To begin, we will follow the description in <ref> [SSW95] </ref> and consider the demands geometrically, so that each can be viewed as a chord of a circle representing the ring. Given this representation, two demands are said to be either parallel or crossing. <p> Some initial simulation studies of real-time routing and slotting have been conducted and described by Wilson [Wil95]. 5.3.

Reference-contexts: In Sections 4 and 5 we discuss the routing and slotting components of DRSP. In Section 4 we present a basic slotting algorithm that was proposed by Tucker <ref> [Tuck75] </ref>. In Section 5, we present several methods for determining the routing of demands in a ring network. <p> The simplicity of interval graph coloring is exploited in a well-known heuristic for coloring arbitrary circular arc graphs proposed in <ref> [Tuck75] </ref>. The routine, adapted for the Slotting Problem, is as follows: Slotting Heuristic: Step 1: Find the node i having the least overlapping demand. Place each of the overlapping demand units into an empty slot. Step 2: The remaining demand units form a set that corresponds to an interval graph. <p> Proof: The result follows directly from the fact that weight-based routings are parallel routings. The slotting that demonstrates the result of Theorem 5 is obtained using the algorithm given in the previous section <ref> [Tuck75] </ref>. This is clearly a polynomial-time algorithm for slotting. Since weight-based routing can be performed in linear time, the result of Corollary 2 assures that weight-based routing followed by the basic slotting algorithm provides a 2-approximation algorithm for DRSP.
