Title: Generic, Model-Based Edge Estimation in the Image Surface

Abstract: Edge detection is the process of estimating extended curve discontinuities in the image intensity surface. As a primary module in image understanding systems, its performance is critical. This paper presents a new family of algorithms for detecting edges in an image. Edges with delta, step and crease cross sections along curves are found. In the algorithm, an image is convolved at each pixel at four orientations. Then, the best least-squares estimate of an edge is made over a 2x2x2 cube determined by adjacent x, y, and ' values. Finally, the detected edge image is built by a primitive linking process. Both theoretical analyses and simulation experiments have been done; real images have been analyzed. Quantitative results indicate that the proposed detector has superior detection and localization; the standard deviations of orientation and transverse position are a factor of four better than the Wang-Binford operator at the same signal to noise ratio. It performs well even when the ratio is less than 4.

Reference-contexts: An intensity image I (x; y) is a mathematical surface. Edges in an image correspond to intensity discontinu-ities in the image surface. Low-order discontinuities types of edges. are interesting, i.e. discontinuities along curves with cross sections in the form of delta, step, and crease, as shown in Fig. 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. In the past, a variety of segmentation algorithms have been developed, like the Binford-Horn operator [2], the Marr-Hildreth operator [3], the Canny operator [4], the Nalwa-Binford operator [5], However, the results are not satisfactory, primarily because they don't produce extended edges with sufficient quality, thus, restricting their applications.

Reference-contexts: Previous work did little about linking due to the lack of accurate edgel data <ref> [8] </ref> [9]. In this algorithm, since the estimates of edgels are well done, the linking process becomes much easier. Assume there are two nearby edgels with parameters (x 1 ; y 1 ; ff 1 ) and (x 2 ; y 2 ; ff 2 ), respectively.

Reference-contexts: Statistically, the hypothesis may be rejected when it is true. The probability of it is called the false negative rate. The false negative rate depends on the threshold <ref> [10] </ref>. As discussed in the previous section, the fluctuation of the edgel orientation is approximated by a Gaussian random variable, thus the threshold of ff can be properly chosen to allow a constant false negative rate.
