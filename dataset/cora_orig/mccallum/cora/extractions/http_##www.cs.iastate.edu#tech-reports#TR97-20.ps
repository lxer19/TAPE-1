Reference-contexts: One such localization tool is the Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960; Gelb, 1974; Crowley, 1995) (or some extension or generalization of it), which allows the robot to build and maintain a stochastic spatial map (Smith et al., 1990), propagate sensory and motion uncertainties, and localize in optimal ways <ref> (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987) </ref>. <p> In our model, we suggested that these aliasing problems in CA3 are resolved by CA1 using dead-reckoning information. It appears that we can use another tool from robotics to elegantly make such distinctions, namely, the Mahalanobis distance <ref> (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987) </ref>. Mahalanobis distance is a metric that computes the difference between predicted and observed values and normalizes them by their covariance. <p> While the extended Kalman filter framework for building 3D maps of the environment was developed by <ref> (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987) </ref>, a generalized filter approach was developed by (Moutarlier & Chatila, 1989) to perform estimation and fusion of uncertain sensory information.

Reference-contexts: Bachelder and Waxman have also implemented a spatial learning system on a mobile robot called MAVIN (mobile adaptive visual navigator). This robot wanders around the environment recognizing places based on the configuration of landmarks visible from that location <ref> (Bachelder & Waxman, 1994) </ref>. Landmarks are recognized using a Seibert-Waxman neural 3D object recogni 41 tion system (Seibert & Waxman, 1992) which is trained to recognize the landmarks prior to the exploration by the robot. <p> As the robot moves, an associative neural network learns the movements that lead from one place to another, using a Hebbian rule. Although this model learns places and recognizes them later in spite of viewing errors and self-motion uncertainties, it does not include any path planning abilities <ref> (Bachelder & Waxman, 1994) </ref>. Recce and Harris have implemented a robot navigation system based on interactions of neorcor-tical and hippocampal theories (Recce & Harris, 1996). According to their theory, the hippocampus functions as an auto-associative memory for matching ego-centric maps which are constructed in the neocortex.

Reference-contexts: The CA1 input is derived from these CA3 activations and dead-reckoning estimates. Our model also suggests specific roles for the different hippocampal regions, which are motivated by experimental data in many cases and serve as predictions in others <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997a) </ref>. Another important difference between the models is our suggestion that the CA1 uses dead-reckoning information to overcome perceptual aliasing problems. <p> Finally, our hippocampal characterization concedes that a multi-level representation of spatial information exists in the hippocampus, namely: directional, topological, and metric, although this aspect has not yet been realized in a computational form. Our model makes some key neurobiological and behavioral predictions that are elaborated elsewhere <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997a) </ref>. For instance, our model predicts that perceptually identical places in the same environment will excite the same population of cells in the CA3 layer but different populations in the CA1 layer. <p> A related behavioral prediction is that an exploring animal will search in gradually expanding trajectories, since this allows the propagation of reliable dead-reckoning estimates further and further away from its starting position <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997a) </ref>. Some possibilities for the neural basis of such computations have also been put forth.

Reference-contexts: Experiments have also demonstrated that stability of landmarks is critical for spatial learning, i.e., even if a goal was constantly and reliably associated with a landmark, the rats failed to capture this relationship if the landmark (and the goal) were moved to different locations in each of the learning trials <ref> (Biegler & Morris, 1996) </ref>. It appears that increasing the number of stable spatial relationships aids learning, rather than merely increasing the number or salience of the landmarks 7 (Biegler & Morris, 1996). <p> failed to capture this relationship if the landmark (and the goal) were moved to different locations in each of the learning trials <ref> (Biegler & Morris, 1996) </ref>. It appears that increasing the number of stable spatial relationships aids learning, rather than merely increasing the number or salience of the landmarks 7 (Biegler & Morris, 1996). Thus, rodents appear to encode spatial information in the form of vectors to landmarks, with each of the landmarks being represented independently. Further, a locomotion-based metric system appears to be involved in the spatial representation, which critically depends on the stability of the landmarks.

Reference-contexts: Such relation-based approaches produce a compact world representation since they only represent distinctive places in the environment. Further, they are robust to global movement errors as they only represent local relationships between places <ref> (Brooks, 1985) </ref>. These topological graphs can be learned through robot exploration. However, navigation to a goal requires a search through the graph to determine a route from the current robot location to the goal, which can be computationally expensive for large graphs.

Reference-contexts: We have suggested that the matrix inversions required in the computation of the Kalman gain and the Mahalanobis distance might be performed in the CA1 layer through an iterative mechanism (O'Keefe, 1989), while the propagation of covariances might be related to the sharp waves observed in resting rats <ref> (Buzsaki, 1989) </ref>. 12.1 Assumptions in our model Some key assumptions have to be made for our computational model to be realizable. These assumptions are clarified in this section. 1.

Reference-contexts: In the neurobiological literature, the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical regions of the medial temporal lobe have long been associated with spatial learning and memory <ref> (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992) </ref>, primarily through data that hippocampal lesions (or damage) produce severe learning deficits, including the ability to learn new stimuli, recognition memory, object-place task memory, etc. (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992). <p> Sb also receives input from the EC and projects to the pre- and post-subiculum, the deep layers of the EC, and to the hypothalamus, septum, anterior thalamus and the cingulate cortex <ref> (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992) </ref>. Although it is not well studied yet, there is some evidence that the EC projects back to many of the cortical association areas from which it receives input and mediates information storage there (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992). <p> the EC, and to the hypothalamus, septum, anterior thalamus and the cingulate cortex <ref> (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992) </ref>. Although it is not well studied yet, there is some evidence that the EC projects back to many of the cortical association areas from which it receives input and mediates information storage there (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992). In addition, there is also some evidence that the hippocampal formation derives input and in turn outputs to the fornix. However, the nature of these projections is still unclear (Rolls, 1990).

Reference-contexts: they appear perfectly capable of navigating accurately to a visible one (Morris et al., 1982; Sutherland et al., 1982). 4.1 Anatomy of the Hippocampal formation The hippocampal formation is an association area of the brain that receives highly processed sensory information from the major associational areas of the cerebral cortex <ref> (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993) </ref> as shown in Figure 1. The inputs arrive at a major convergence area, collectively called the parahippocampal cortical area, which itself consists of the perirhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex proper, the entorhinal cortex (EC), and the pre- and post-subiculum (Squire et al., 1989).

Reference-contexts: Experiments with gerbils have shed light on the nature of spatial representations, and it appears that these animals compute vectors to landmarks. Further, independent vectors are computed for each of the landmarks <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. The researchers also found some evidence that suggested the grounding of internal spatial representations in a locomotion-based metric system (Collett et al., 1986). <p> Further, independent vectors are computed for each of the landmarks <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It has also been shown experimentally that in conflict situations between distant but familiar visual references and path-integration, the animals appear to give priority to stable visual references <ref> (Etienne et al., 1990) </ref>. Thus, dead-reckoning behaviors are used by rodents to navigate. It also appears that animals have access to both sensory as well as path-integration input, and choose one over the other depending on their navigation context.

Reference-contexts: This has led to the suggestion that in the absence of visual information, path-integration appears to be useful only for short exploratory excursions from a known site <ref> (Etienne et al., 1996) </ref>. It has also been shown experimentally that in conflict situations between distant but familiar visual references and path-integration, the animals appear to give priority to stable visual references (Etienne et al., 1990). Thus, dead-reckoning behaviors are used by rodents to navigate.

Reference-contexts: However, the sensed range of landmarks is assumed to be corrupted by a zero-mean Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of S = 0:01 per unit distance. This error value of 1% per unit distance is compatible with contemporary sonar-based distance ranging <ref> (Everett, 1995) </ref>. As explained earlier, the sensed landmark information is provided as input to the EC layer. In our simulations, the variance of the distance-matching Gaussians in the EC units was taken to be 2 L = 1:5 2 . These units also used threshold of EC = 0:6. <p> Since the odo-metric approaches derive their navigational parameters from wheel rotation, they are subject 44 to problems arising from slippage, tread wear, and/or improper tire inflation (Balakrishna & Ghosal, 1995; Everett, 1995). However, Doppler and inertial navigation systems can often be used to considerably reduce these sources of errors <ref> (Everett, 1995) </ref>. Doppler navigation systems operate on the principle of the Doppler shift in frequency, observed when radiated energy reflects off a surface that is moving with respect to the emitter. <p> These are then integrated over time to yield velocity and position. Such systems, although capable of producing reasonably precise dead-reckoning, currently have limited applications owing to their prohibitive cost <ref> (Everett, 1995) </ref>. However, with advances in technology, it is conceivable that accurate and affordable dead-reckoning devices will soon become available, making our approach quite practical. 3. Maintaining correlations With probabilistic localization approaches like the Kalman filter, it is imperative that the correlations between the state variables be maintained correctly.

Reference-contexts: When rats were wrapped in a towel thereby preventing movement of their limbs and transported passively through a familiar environment, hippocampal neuronal activity was seen to cease <ref> (Foster et al., 1989) </ref>. Normal hippocampal activity resumed when the restraint was removed. It was also noted that movement was not necessary for place cell activity to resume; it was sufficient that the animal could move if it wanted to (Foster et al., 1989). <p> a familiar environment, hippocampal neuronal activity was seen to cease <ref> (Foster et al., 1989) </ref>.

A similar experiment has also shown the involvement of the motor system in the firing of head-direction cells in the thalamus (Knierim et al., 1995).

Reference-contexts: an abstract level, there appear to be unifying theories of spatial representation in animals and robots. 3.3 Role of path-integration in navigation Path-integration, popularly known as dead-reckoning, refers to the process of updating an estimate of one's own position based on the knowledge of direction, speed, and time of self-motion <ref> (Gallistel, 1990) </ref>. This usually involves integrating acceleration signals over time to obtain velocities, and the integration of velocity signals over time to obtain displacement vectors (Gallistel, 1990; Gallistel & Cramer, 1996). There is substantial evidence for path-integration in animals (Wehner, 1992; Wehner & Srini-vasan, 1981; Etienne, 1992; Gallistel, 1990).

Reference-contexts: According to their thesis, the hippocampal formation allows the animal to learn and recognize places and build a metric representation of space by using dead-reckoning information (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978). Based on extensive behavioral experiments with rodents, researchers have concluded that space plays a dominant role in their behavior <ref> (Hebb, 1949) </ref>. It also appears that rats give more importance to remote sensory cues than to local ones, possibly because remote cues are the least-variable objects in the environment (Hebb, 1949). <p> Based on extensive behavioral experiments with rodents, researchers have concluded that space plays a dominant role in their behavior <ref> (Hebb, 1949) </ref>. It also appears that rats give more importance to remote sensory cues than to local ones, possibly because remote cues are the least-variable objects in the environment (Hebb, 1949). Rats have also been found to successfully swim to a submerged platform in a milky pool of water thereby demonstrating an ability to compute trajectories to hidden goal locations (Morris, 1981).

Reference-contexts: However, it turns out that it is autocorrelated and hence is not a white sequence (proposition 5). This autocorrelation is difficult to measure, and though we could use extended state vectors to estimate this correlation, leading to augmented Kalman filtering (pp 212, <ref> (Jazwinski, 1970) </ref>), we simply choose to ignore it. The justification for this is provided by the navigation behavior of the animal.

Since then, cells with such location-specific firing have been found in almost every major region of the hippocampal system, including: the EC (Quirk et al., 1992), the Dg <ref> (Jung & McNaughton, 1993) </ref>, the hippocampus proper (O'Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971; O'Keefe, 1976), the Sb (Barnes et al., 1990; Sharp & Green, 1994), and the postsubiculum (Sharp, 1996). In addition to place cells, head-direction cells have also been discovered.

Reference-contexts: Smith and Cheeseman argued strongly for the use of Bayesian estimation theory in robot spatial representation (the stochastic map) (Smith et al., 1990), and showed that an optimal information fusion approach was equivalent to a simple form of Kalman filtering <ref> (Kalman, 1960) </ref>. While the extended Kalman filter framework for building 3D maps of the environment was developed by (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987), a generalized filter approach was developed by (Moutarlier & Chatila, 1989) to perform estimation and fusion of uncertain sensory information.

Reference-contexts: Other experiments have established that the rats appear to know how visual scenes are transformed by locomotion and are capable of computing approach trajectories using inverse transformations <ref> (Keith & McVety, 1988) </ref>. Experiments with gerbils have shed light on the nature of spatial representations, and it appears that these animals compute vectors to landmarks. Further, independent vectors are computed for each of the landmarks (Collett et al., 1986).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, head-direction cells have also been found to be responsive to visual inputs. It appears that rats develop stable, unique associations between visual stimuli and the cells of the path integration system, which allows them to automatically realign the path integration system when mismatches occur <ref> (Knierim et al., 1995) </ref>. However, if the rats were disoriented during training, they were unable to develop stable associations and consequently could not reorient their directional framework (Knierim et al., 1995). 13 Finally, the role of the motor system in place and head-direction cell firing is shown by ex-periments involving motion <p> visual stimuli and the cells of the path integration system, which allows them to automatically realign the path integration system when mismatches occur <ref> (Knierim et al., 1995) </ref>. However, if the rats were disoriented during training, they were unable to develop stable associations and consequently could not reorient their directional framework (Knierim et al., 1995). 13 Finally, the role of the motor system in place and head-direction cell firing is shown by ex-periments involving motion restraints. <p> A similar experiment has also shown the involvement of the motor system in the firing of head-direction cells in the thalamus <ref> (Knierim et al., 1995) </ref>. Since the path-integration system presumably receives input from the motor system (in the form of a motor efference copy or gating signals), these experiments further implicate path-integration in place and head-direction cell firing (McNaughton et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: The local relationships that are usually represented include the directional relationship between places (Nehmzow, 1995) or the directional relationship compounded with distance information <ref> (Kuipers & Byun, 1991) </ref>. Some topological schemes also represent metric information pertaining to the distinctive place, which is useful if the place represents, say, a wall or a corridor (Mataric, 1992). Such relation-based approaches produce a compact world representation since they only represent distinctive places in the environment. <p> The lowest level consists of control rules that define distinctive places as some property of sensory inputs. The next higher level creates a topological representation by linking distinctive places by travel edges. The highest level in the hierarchy contains a geometric representation of the robot's sensory environment <ref> (Kuipers & Byun, 1991) </ref>. This cognitive spatial learning architecture was implemented on a simulated robot NX (Kuipers & Byun, 1991) and later extended to physical robots (Kuipers et al., 1993). <p> The next higher level creates a topological representation by linking distinctive places by travel edges.

Reference-contexts: Use of such tools to analyze biologically inspired models can often yield new insights into the capabilities and limitations of the underlying information processing structures and processes <ref> (Levy, 1989) </ref>. The preceding discussion suggests that biologically inspired modeling efforts and the design of autonomous mobile robots can each benefit from the results and tools developed by the other. Against this background, this paper develops a biologically inspired model of spatial learning and localization for mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: Some topological schemes also represent metric information pertaining to the distinctive place, which is useful if the place represents, say, a wall or a corridor <ref> (Mataric, 1992) </ref>. Such relation-based approaches produce a compact world representation since they only represent distinctive places in the environment. Further, they are robust to global movement errors as they only represent local relationships between places (Brooks, 1985). These topological graphs can be learned through robot exploration. <p> Mataric implemented a topological place graph <ref> (Mataric, 1992) </ref>, loosely based on the place unit model of McNaughton and Nadel (McNaughton, 1989; McNaughton & Nadel, 1990). Using her model, the robot Toto explored the environment and built a topological graph. The nodes in the graph represented landmarks and the links encoded the robot motions. <p> Once the map was built, goal-directed navigation was performed by spreading activation backwards from the goal node and following the path to the strongest activated neighbor of the current node. Thus the model implements topological navigation and is incapable of determining novel routes or short-cuts <ref> (Mataric, 1992) </ref>. Bachelder and Waxman have also implemented a spatial learning system on a mobile robot called MAVIN (mobile adaptive visual navigator). This robot wanders around the environment recognizing places based on the configuration of landmarks visible from that location (Bachelder & Waxman, 1994).

Reference-contexts: This has led to the suggestion of a vector-based representation of space, according to which, a direct vector to a goal location can be computed by subtracting a vector from the goal location to a landmark from a vector to the same landmark from the current location <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1995) </ref>. <p> In novel environments on the other hand, a rotation of the environment does not produce any noticeable change in the place fields or head-direction preferences <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1995) </ref>. Similarly, head-direction cells have also been found to be responsive to visual inputs.

Reference-contexts: The Dg receives input from the EC via the perforant path, and outputs to the CA3 via mossy fibers. These mossy fiber synapses with CA3 are rather strong, which has led researchers to suggest that they provide the context (O'Keefe, 1989) or reference frame <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1996) </ref>, possibly through non-redundant and orthogonal coding of the EC input (Rolls, 1996; Rolls, 1990). The CA3 region of the hippocampus primarily contains pyramidal (or complex-spike) cells along with inhibitory interneurons like basket cells, chandelier cells, mossy cells, etc. (Traub & Miles, 1991; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992). <p> Some experimental evidence for this view is provided by <ref> (Skaggs & McNaughton, 1996) </ref> and additional support comes from the observation of hippocampal activity classical conditioning tasks (Schmajuk, 1986; Schmajuk & DiCarlo, 1991; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992). <p> Since the path-integration system presumably receives input from the motor system (in the form of a motor efference copy or gating signals), these experiments further implicate path-integration in place and head-direction cell firing <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1996) </ref>. In summary, place cells and head-direction cells respond to sensory as well as path-integration inputs. These cells are active in multiple environments and also active in multiple places in the same environment. <p> Our model assumes that dead-reckoning information is made available to the hip-pocampus, which performs spatial learning and localization to maintain reliable dead-reckoning 18 estimates. This is in contrast to the thesis of <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1996) </ref> who suggest that the hippocampus performs dead-reckoning (McNaughton et al., 1996). Our model is closely related to the theory proposed by Touretzky and colleagues (Wan et al., 1994; Redish & Touretzky, 1996). <p> Our model assumes that dead-reckoning information is made available to the hip-pocampus, which performs spatial learning and localization to maintain reliable dead-reckoning 18 estimates. This is in contrast to the thesis of <ref> (McNaughton et al., 1996) </ref> who suggest that the hippocampus performs dead-reckoning (McNaughton et al., 1996). Our model is closely related to the theory proposed by Touretzky and colleagues (Wan et al., 1994; Redish & Touretzky, 1996). However the two models differ in the manner in which the sensory inputs are made available to the place cells.

Reference-contexts: This section explores the similarities between spatial representation and learning processes in animals and robots. 3.1 Representation of spatial information in robots Contemporary robots usually represent spatial information in one of two ways: metric (location-based) or relation-based <ref> (Moutarlier & Chatila, 1989) </ref> (although some approaches have attempted to combine the merits of the two (Thrun, 1996; Levitt & Lawton, 1990; Kuipers & Byun, 1991; Kortenkamp, 1993)). In a metric representation of space, all the places (or object locations) are represented in the same coordinate frame. <p> While the extended Kalman filter framework for building 3D maps of the environment was developed by (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987), a generalized filter approach was developed by <ref> (Moutarlier & Chatila, 1989) </ref> to perform estimation and fusion of uncertain sensory information.

Recce and Harris have implemented a robot navigation system based on interactions of neorcor-tical and hippocampal theories <ref> (Recce & Harris, 1996) </ref>. According to their theory, the hippocampus functions as an auto-associative memory for matching ego-centric maps which are constructed in the neocortex. <p> The hippocampus stores snapshots of this ego-centric map and the activity of head-direction cells are used to determine the best map rotation to match the snapshots stored in the hippocampus <ref> (Recce & Harris, 1996) </ref>. Using a mobile robot with sonar sensors, they have tested an implementation of their theory. The approaches described in this section deal with topological space representations.

Reference-contexts: This robot wanders around the environment recognizing places based on the configuration of landmarks visible from that location (Bachelder & Waxman, 1994). Landmarks are recognized using a Seibert-Waxman neural 3D object recogni 41 tion system <ref> (Seibert & Waxman, 1992) </ref> which is trained to recognize the landmarks prior to the exploration by the robot. As the robot moves, an associative neural network learns the movements that lead from one place to another, using a Hebbian rule.

Reference-contexts: Some experimental evidence for this view is provided by <ref> (Skaggs & McNaughton, 1996) </ref> and additional support comes from the observation of hippocampal activity classical conditioning tasks (Schmajuk, 1986; Schmajuk & DiCarlo, 1991; Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992).

Reference-contexts: This has led to many probabilistic localization approaches for mobile robots. One such localization tool is the Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960; Gelb, 1974; Crowley, 1995) (or some extension or generalization of it), which allows the robot to build and maintain a stochastic spatial map <ref> (Smith et al., 1990) </ref>, propagate sensory and motion uncertainties, and localize in optimal ways (Ayache & Faugeras, 1987). <p> Smith and Cheeseman argued strongly for the use of Bayesian estimation theory in robot spatial representation (the stochastic map) <ref> (Smith et al., 1990) </ref>, and showed that an optimal information fusion approach was equivalent to a simple form of Kalman filtering (Kalman, 1960).

Reference-contexts: The inputs arrive at a major convergence area, collectively called the parahippocampal cortical area, which itself consists of the perirhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex proper, the entorhinal cortex (EC), and the pre- and post-subiculum <ref> (Squire et al., 1989) </ref>. The hippocampal formation is composed of the dentate gyrus (Dg), and areas CA3 and CA1 of 10 Ammon's horn, and for this reason, is often referred to as the trisynaptic circuit.

Reference-contexts: Based on his studies with rats, Tolman suggested that spatial behavior is a result of metric computations that are made possible by spatial information stored in a metric form in cognitive maps <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref>. However, Hull explained the experimental observations of Tolman in terms of the habit-family hierarchy, arguing that spatial behavior arises strictly through the association of specific responses with particular stimuli (Hull, 1934a; Hull, 1934b). <p> Surprisingly, there have been relatively few models of metric navigation (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978; Prescott & Mayhew, 1992; Worden, 1992; Prescott, 1995; Wan et al., 1994; Redish & Touretzky, 1996). even though the idea of a cognitive map <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref>, and the suggestion that the hippocampus is the site for such a map (the locale system) have existed for a long while (O'Keefe 15 & Nadel, 1978). <p> This position estimate is used by the probabilistic localization process. 11.2 Topological approaches based on cognitive mapping theories Tolman proposed that animals and humans form an internal representation of the environment, which he called a cognitive map <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref>. Since then, many researchers have developed theories of cognitive mapping (Kaplan, 1973a; Kaplan, 1973b; Kuipers, 1978).

These navigation behaviors are described below. In place-recognition triggered response (PRTR), each place is associated with a navigation response that the animal performs when in that place.

Reference-contexts: Usually, distinctive places are defined based sonar signatures (Kuipers & Byun, 1991; Mataric, 1992; Kortenkamp, 1993), image signatures (Kortenkamp, 1993; Kortenkamp & Weymouth, 1994; Engelson, 1994), panoramic views <ref> (Tsuji & Li, 1993) </ref>, local occupancy grids (Langley & Pfleger, 1995; Yamauchi & Langley, 1997), etc. The local relationships that are usually represented include the directional relationship between places (Nehmzow, 1995) or the directional relationship compounded with distance information (Kuipers & Byun, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Further, places appear to be represented in the hippocampus using an ensemble code, i.e., a set of place cells appear to code for a place <ref> (Wilson & McNaughton, 1993) </ref>. Experiments have also revealed that when the animal is introduced into a familiar environment, place fields are initialized based on visual cues and landmarks (Muller & Kubie, 1987; Muller et al., 1987; Sharp et al., 1990). <p> To keep the discussion simple we will henceforth assume that place codes in CA3 and CA1 are represented by single units, although in reality ensembles of units are known to code for place <ref> (Wilson & McNaughton, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In these approaches, dead-reckoning is used to provide estimates of robot position which are subsequently corrected based on observations. Recently, Yamauchi and Beer have defined a spatial representation scheme based on adaptive place networks, where Cartesian position estimates derived from dead-reckoning are used to represent regions of physical space <ref> (Yamauchi & Beer, 1996) </ref>. In the next section, we will show that animals represent space as a combination of sensory 9 and dead-reckoning information. <p> Pure dead-reckoning based systems cannot localize after being kidnapped <ref> (Yamauchi & Beer, 1996) </ref> while pure sensory based systems will localize incorrectly if perceptual aliasing exists. In addition to the contributions summarized above, our characterization of the hippocampus supports a few additional capabilities which are yet to be implemented.
