Abstract: This work considers the problem of routing connections with QoS requirements across networks, when the information available for making routing decisions is inaccurate. This uncertainty about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a number of different environments, which are reviewed in the paper. The goal of the route selection process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the QoS requirements. For end-to-end delay guarantees, this problem is intractable. However, we show that by decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local delay constraints, efficient and tractable solutions can be established. We first consider the simpler problem of decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local constraints, for a given path. We show that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable. Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions, which posses a certain convexity property, and restricting ourselves to that class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions. Moreover, we show that typical distributions would belong to that class. We then consider the general problem, of combined path optimization and delay decomposition. We present an efficient solution scheme for the above class of probability distributions. Our solution is similar to that of the restricted shortest-path problem, which renders itself to near-optimal approximations of polynomial complexity. We also show that yet simpler solutions exist in the special case of uniform distributions. Finally, we consider an adaptive variant of the problem, where rerouting can be performed after each hop.

Reference-contexts: We assume in all problems that we seek a single-source to single-destination shortest path. Before we discuss the various shortest path problems we should consider their relation to the problems defined above. Most shortest path problems (and consequently their corresponding algorithms) have an optimal substructure property <ref> [1] </ref>. This property means that a shortest path between two vertices contains other shortest paths within it. This property is a hallmark of the applicability of both dynamic-programming and greedy methods. <p> We start with a greedy method and improve upon it. However, first we observe that the problem is intractable. 4.1 Problem OP is NP hard We show that Problem OP can be reduced to the 0-1 knapsack problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 4.1 Problem OP is NP-hard. Proof Consider an instance of the knapsack problem.

Reference-contexts: The establishment of efficient QoS routing schemes is, undoubtly, one of the major building blocks in such architectures. Indeed, QoS routing has been the subject of several studies and proposals (see, e.g., <ref> [8, 11, 2, 5, 4] </ref> and references therein). It has been recognized that the establishment of an efficient QoS routing scheme poses several complex challenges. One of the major challenges results from the inherent uncertainty of the information available to the QoS routing process. <p> Among the various QoS parameters, the two major ones are bandwidth and end-to-end delay. In the presence of inaccuracies, the former was shown to be polynomially solvable, while the latter poses major obstacles, such as computational intractability <ref> [5] </ref>. In this work we focus on end-to-end delay guarantees. We explore the impact of inaccurate network information on the QoS routing process, identify useful and problematic properties in this process and present efficient solutions to the various related problems. <p> However, such models are not really accurate because they implicitly assume knowledge on the topology, e.g. number of hops, for which aggregation introduces uncertainty. Furthermore, the rate information itself might contain inaccuracies <ref> [5] </ref>, thus some uncertainty remains. Hidden Information Interconnected networks may include private networks that hide some or all of their information. One reason for this could be hiding the network's internal, proprietary, mechanisms. Typically, such networks would advertise information that contains inaccuracies or advertise ranges for specific parameters. <p> A source node is presented with a request to establish a new connection that meets given end-to-end delay requirements. The source node seeks a path that is most likely to satisfy these requirements. The basis for this work was laid in <ref> [5] </ref>. That study presented the framework of a network with uncertain parameters, and solved the QoS routing problem for rate demands and for delay demands under a rate-based model (as in [10]). <p> This is especially true if we try to solve Problem OP-MP with a predefined (non-optimal) solution of Problem OP. For instance, partitioning the delay with equal probabilities for all links, allows us to use standard shortest path solutions as shown by <ref> [5] </ref>. 8 3.1 Shortest Path in a Graph [SP] This is the basic shortest path problem. <p> Such an algorithm was presented without proof in <ref> [5] </ref>. Remark 4.4 Algortihm Uniform-OP finds ff fl by direct calculation, and independently of ffi. Therefore, for uniform probabilities we can relax any assumption made on ffi. <p> As an example, consider a partition strategy which maintains equal probabilities of success on all links. This strategy means that the probability of success on each link depends only on the number of hops in the path. As shown in <ref> [5] </ref>, this special case can be reduced to Problem R-MRP, which can be solved in O (jV j jEj D). 14 Specifically, in this case, there are only jV j possibilities (corresponding to the possible number of hops) for the delay allocated to each link, thus G (n; u; v) can <p> N (x) is a monotonic increasing function, thus we seek a path p that maximizes D l2p r P 2 : This problem somewhat resembles the shortest path with rational objective functions solved by <ref> [5] </ref>. This suggests that for exponential distributions, it may be possible to solve Problem MP. Unfortunately, the method of [5] cannot be applied to our objective function. <p> a monotonic increasing function, thus we seek a path p that maximizes D l2p r P 2 : This problem somewhat resembles the shortest path with rational objective functions solved by <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: X c l B and l2p fl X w l for any other path p that satisfies the restriction X c l B: This problem is NP-hard [3]. There are however pseudo-polynomial algorithms which use dynamic programming methods. Also, there are approximate polynomial solutions based on these (e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>). The dynamic programming method assumes discrete costs, i.e., c l = k l b for all l 2 E, where fk l g l2E are positive integers, and also B = kb for some positive integer k. <p> Furthermore, we established an O 2 solution for the case of uniform distributions. For Problem R-SP, there are fully polynomial approximation schemes (FPAS), e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>, which are derived from the dynamic programming, exact (pseudo-polynomial) solution. As we have been able to construct a similar exact solution to Problem OP-MP , our work indicates that similar FPAS schemes can be employed, in order to get fully polynomial and near-optimal solutions for Problem OP-MP.

Reference-contexts: Other schemes may imply different probability distributions, and publish specific parameters associated with these distributions, such as mean and variance. Rate parameters can be retained through aggregation (see for example <ref> [7] </ref>). This is an indication that "rate-based" models for delay guarantees can have aggregated delay parameters without any uncertainty. However, such models are not really accurate because they implicitly assume knowledge on the topology, e.g. number of hops, for which aggregation introduces uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: The establishment of efficient QoS routing schemes is, undoubtly, one of the major building blocks in such architectures. Indeed, QoS routing has been the subject of several studies and proposals (see, e.g., <ref> [8, 11, 2, 5, 4] </ref> and references therein). It has been recognized that the establishment of an efficient QoS routing scheme poses several complex challenges. One of the major challenges results from the inherent uncertainty of the information available to the QoS routing process. <p> Accordingly, proposals have been made on how to provide the needed information in a scalable form. For example, the ATM Forum PNNI standard <ref> [8] </ref> introduces a hierarchical process that aggregates information as the network gets more and more remote. However, the aggregation process inherently decreases the accuracy of the information and introduces uncertainty. The semantics of the available parameters depend on the aggregation method used.

Reference-contexts: Typically, they are just approximations of the real parameters and values, since they are based on elaborated models that cannot represent the true intricacy of the 2 devices. The calculated parameters are usually upper bounds (as in <ref> [9] </ref>) or incorporate some inaccurate assumptions. Approximate calculation is hence yet another source of uncertainty in the advertised parameters. 1.2 Goals of the Paper Our overall goal is to investigate the impact of uncertain parameters on routing with end-to-end delay guarantees.

Reference-contexts: The basis for this work was laid in [5]. That study presented the framework of a network with uncertain parameters, and solved the QoS routing problem for rate demands and for delay demands under a rate-based model (as in <ref> [10] </ref>). It also presented heuristic methods for dealing with end-to-end delay requirements in models that are not rate-based, and optimal solutions for specific cases. The present study extends that framework, and achieves optimal solutions for the general case. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
