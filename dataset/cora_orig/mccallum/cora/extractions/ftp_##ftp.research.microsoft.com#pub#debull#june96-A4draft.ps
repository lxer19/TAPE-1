Reference-contexts: This product can be used in connection with DB2. 4 Research in Online Reorganization Besides the work described above for products, work has also taken place in research. 7 4.1 Incremental Restoration of Clustering Within Users' Transactions Bennett and Franaszek <ref> [1] </ref> describe a strategy for incremental restoration of clustering within users' transactions. The concepts in the strategy can apply to any storage hierarchy in which a unit of data transfer between two levels in the hierarchy contains smaller units.

Reference-contexts: A technical report [12] surveys IBM and non-IBM work in online reorganization. 2 Restoration of Clustering for DB2 for MVS/ESA Database 2 (DB2) for MVS/ESA <ref> [2] </ref> is a relational DBMS. The sections below describe several methods of reorganization for DB2, roughly in increasing order of concurrency. 2.1 Clustering and Reorganization In DB2, each table can have a clustering index.
Reference: [3] <institution> IBM Corp. </institution> <note> An Introduction to DataPropagator Relational Release 1, GC26-3398-01, </note> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: Delete the original copy. Mix's description includes the tasks that a database administrator performs. 2.3 Read/Write Access While Reorganizing and Using Replication DataPropagator Relational <ref> [3] </ref> and Replidata/MVS [5] are products that support replication of DB2 databases. They are not facilities for reorganization, but either of them can be used to achieve the effect of reorganization that allows read/write access. They require a table to have a unique key.

Reference-contexts: Here are two possible sequences for this step: * Allow users to read the shadow, create a backup copy while allowing just reading, and then allow users to read and write the shadow (after the backup completes). * Use a strategy (e.g., concurrent copy <ref> [4] </ref>, described in Section 3.3) that allows users to read and write the shadow as soon as the backup begins. 7. Delete the original copy. <p> A file can be partitioned by key range, and a partition can be reorganized o*ine while the other partitions are online. 3.3 Online Creation of a Backup Copy of Data in Concurrent Copy Concurrent copy <ref> [4] </ref>, which uses both hardware (in a storage control unit) and software, produces a backup copy of data. The copy reflects the state of the database at the start of copying.

Reference-contexts: Partitions reside in separate files. DB2 can reorganize one partition o*ine while the other partitions are online. Next we will describe ways to increase the concurrency during reorganization. 2.2 Read-Only Access While Reorganizing into a Shadow Copy Mix <ref> [6] </ref> describes a strategy that extends read-only access to cover the reloading step. This strategy, which is not part of the DB2 product, does not require any modification to DB2's normal facility for reorganization. Here are the main steps of the strategy: 1.

Management of Data, May (SIGMOD Record, </booktitle> <volume> Vol. 22, No. 2, </volume> <month> June), </month> <pages> pp. 445-448. </pages>
Reference-contexts: However, NSF needs no side file and has less sophisticated logging and undo requirements for user transactions. The IBM Application System/400 allows writing during construction of indexes <ref> [7] </ref>. The unpublished algorithm is similar to SF and preceded the work of Mohan and Narang. 5 Summary We have surveyed work in online reorganization in IBM products and IBM research. Much of the work deals with restoration of clustering.

Conf. Management of Data, June (SIGMOD Record, </booktitle> <volume> Vol. 21, No. 2), </volume> <pages> pp. 361-370. </pages>
Reference-contexts: The model predicts that the maximum permitted steady-state arrival rate decreases as disk storage utilization increases, since the increased utilization requires more reorganizations. Reduction in the amount of movement required by reorganization increases the maximum permitted steady-state arrival rate. 4.3 Online Construction of Indexes Mohan and Narang <ref> [8] </ref> describe two algorithms for online construction of an index. The reorganizer scans the data for key values and record identifiers, sorts them, and builds the index while periodically checkpointing the highest key inserted.

Reference-contexts: Of course, this reorganization consumes disk bandwidth and thus degrades system performance. 8 If a reorganization algorithm moves only a subset of the data instead of all the data, this reduction in movement might improve the performance. Robinson and Franaszek <ref> [9] </ref> model the performance of a log structured file system and the performance improvement that results from moving only a subset of the data. The analytic model, which can apply to any criterion for choosing the subset, predicts how online reorganization affects available disk bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: DB2 uses this table to translate the identifiers in log entries before applying the entries to the shadow copy. 3 Online Reorganization for Other Products We now turn from DB2 to other products. 3.1 Purging of Old Data in PARS/ACP In the PARS/ACP system for airline reservations <ref> [10, 11] </ref>, flights for the next n days have a fine index (for quick access), and flights for later days have a coarse index (to save space).
