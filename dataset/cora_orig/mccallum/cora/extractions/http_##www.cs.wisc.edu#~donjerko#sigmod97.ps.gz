Abstract: DEVise is a data exploration system that allows users to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentations of large tabular datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several sources. The DEVise framework is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number of user groups. Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (includ-ing retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, a comprehensive discussion of all the related work is beyond the scope of this paper, but we now briefly discuss the relationship of DEVise to well-known tools in each of these categories.

Reference-contexts: Other examples of summaries include: 1. Statistical measures over subsets of the data. Indeed, such summaries are so useful that support is built directly into the current version of the visualization engine of DEVise. 2. Compressed versions of images <ref> [9] </ref>. Again, DEVise has built-in support for retrieving images at various levels of compression. 7.2 Collaborative Analysis A visual presentation, as we noted earlier, has two parts: a data-independent visual template, and a data-dependent VGData.

Reference-contexts: From the standpoint of data visualization, DEVise is a general-purpose tool for visual exploration of tabular datasets, unlike tools like Vis5D [5], LinkWinds [6], Traceview [10], ParaGraph [4], etc., that are specialized for a particular application domain. Other visualization tools (e.g., Vis5D, LinkWinds, AVS [14], Khoros <ref> [13] </ref>) also assume that the datasets are sufficiently small for them to run entirely in main memory; such an assumption limits the ability of the tool to `go back' to the source data record from its visual presentation.

Reference-contexts: They want to process images and classify the pixels into categories like `trees' and `sky', and even `branches', `soil', `sunlit leaves', etc. We've combined a tool called BIRCH <ref> [15] </ref>, which was developed for finding clusters of points in multidimensional datasets, with DEVise to create an analysis environment that they are currently using on a daily basis for classifying images. By applying BIRCH, they obtain a collection of clusters, each of which corresponds to a category (e.g., `trees').
