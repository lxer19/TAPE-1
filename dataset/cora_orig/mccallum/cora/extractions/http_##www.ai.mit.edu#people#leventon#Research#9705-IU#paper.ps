Abstract: We present a method for finding the pose of an object in the world by registering a 3D model of the object to multiple images of the object taken from different positions by maximization of mutual information. Using multiple views of the object enables the registration process to converge on the three dimensional pose much more accurately than is possible from using just a single view. Since this method uses mutual information, the model of the object need only contain information about the shape of the object and need not know any details about other surface properties. Furthermore, this method is robust with respect to variations of illumination in the images. The method does not attempt to find any correspondences between pixels in the images, so the images of the object can be obtained from drastically different views and under different lighting conditions.

Reference-contexts: However, many objects have varying albedo and also shadow themselves, which will lead to many spurious edges in the image. Fiducial registration involves manually picking corresponding points from the 3D model and the object. Accurately localizing these points is often difficult. For neurosurgical applications, Peters <ref> [ Peters et al., 1996 ] </ref> reports fiducial accuracy about an order magnitude worse than frame-based methods of registration, mainly due to the difficulty in accurately localizing the fiducial markers in both the internal scan and also on the patient. 3 Mutual Information Registration In this section we review the basic

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the problem of computing the registration is a challenging one. One of the advantages of a mutual information approach to registration is that it is robust to many of the unknowns that can occur in an image, in cluding lighting conditions and occlusions <ref> [ Viola and Wells, 1995 ] </ref> . Viola and Wells used this approach to compute a very accurate registration of a 3D model of an object to that object's position in the image plane. <p> Their error for registrations of a plastic skull were mostly under 2mm in the x and y dimension, but ranged from 5mm to almost 15mm in the z dimension <ref> [ Viola and Wells, 1995 ] </ref> . A change in an object's x and y position is very noticeable in an image, while a shift in model position along the optical axis is difficult to see. <p> than frame-based methods of registration, mainly due to the difficulty in accurately localizing the fiducial markers in both the internal scan and also on the patient. 3 Mutual Information Registration In this section we review the basic method of alignment by maximization of mutual information, which has been described previously, <ref> [ Viola and Wells, 1995 ] </ref> [ Viola, 1995 ] [ Wells et al., 1995 ] . <p> It encourages transformations where u explains v well. Together the last two terms identify transformations that find complexity and explain it well. This is the essence of mutual information. In <ref> [ Viola and Wells, 1995 ] </ref> and [ Viola, 1995 ] a stochastic gradient descent method was used to seek local maxima of the mutual information criterion, and [ Wells et al., 1995 ] described a gradient method that uses histograms to approximate entropies and their derivatives. <p> The algorithm is very similar to that which is described in <ref> [ Viola and Wells, 1995 ] </ref> . To apply the mutual information registration technique to multiple views, we perform a single-view registration "step" for each view in turn.
