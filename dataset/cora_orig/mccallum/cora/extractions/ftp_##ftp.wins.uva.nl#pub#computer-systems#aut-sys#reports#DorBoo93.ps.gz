Abstract: We extend morphology to tangential morphology of differentiable surfaces, described by set-valued functions. We show that there is a preserved logarithmic inner product, and a standard basis of morphological eigenfunctions. The components on this basis form the slope transform. In (logarithmic) analogy to linear signal processing, the slope transform of a dilation equals the sum of the slope transforms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, a need has been recognized for an analytical theory of morphological operators, in addition to the classical synthesis. Such a theory would find immediate application [6]. Analytical results have been achieved: differential equations for morphology <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] [7], and the central importance of slope [4]. In this paper, we develop the beginnings of a morphological systems theory. It is completely analogous to linear system theory. <p> This law is proved in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.1 Tangential Dilation The law of parallel transport is one-sided: not all points at @A with a normal ~n will lead to points with a normal ~n on @(A S). We now deviate from classical morphology by concentrating completely on the (directed) boundaries of objects, and omitting their interior. <p> It helps with the formulation of the theory in the same way the Dirac delta function helps in the theory of the Fourier transform. We also need an interval func tion I (x): I (x) = f0g if x 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> (23) This is the logarithmic analogy to the block function in linear filtering. In the linear theory, multiplication by a block function results in restriction - in morphology, Minkowski addition of the interval function I () results in restriction.

Reference-contexts: 5 5 It is a pleasant surprise that the slope transform, derived so specifically as the unique transform suited for the analysis of the mathematical morphology of functions, is actually very closely related to a well-known transform from mathematical physics: The slope transform is a generalization of the Legendre transformation <ref> [3] </ref> to non-convex functions. original transform jxj I (!) 2a x 2 1 1 x 2 1 + ! 2 3 x 3 2 1 p log x 1 log ! ax + b (! a) + b 4.1 Some Slope Transforms Fig.5 gives the slope transforms of some common functions.

Reference-contexts: Compare this expression to the classical definition of the dilation for functions (from <ref> [5] </ref>): (f g)(x) = v There are two differences. The difference in the argument can be resolved by the coordinate transformation v ! x u. The major difference is that `stat' is replaced by the supremum operator _: classical dilation is defined as the global maximum of the argument.

The system is well described by dilations, and the importance of the Legendre transform has been recognized <ref> [6] </ref>. Such applications should pose new challenges to the development of a quantitative theory of morphology. We believe the slope transform will be as essential to analytical morphology as the Fourier transform is to linear systems.
