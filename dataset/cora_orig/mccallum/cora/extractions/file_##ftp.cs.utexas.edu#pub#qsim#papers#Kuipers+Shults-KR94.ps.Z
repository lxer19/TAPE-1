Abstract: An intelligent agent, reasoning symbolically in a continuous world, needs to infer properties of the behaviors of continuous systems. A qualitative simulator, such as QSIM, constructs a set of possible behaviors consistent with a qualitative differential equation (QDE) and initial state. This set of behaviors is expressed as a finite tree of qualitative state descriptions. In the case of QSIM, this set is guaranteed to contain the "actual" behavior under certain circumstances. We call this property the "soundness" of QSIM. The behavior tree can then be interpreted as a model for statements in a branching-time temporal logic such as Expressive Behavior Tree Logic (EBTL), which we introduce. Because QSIM is sound, validity of an EBTL proposition (necessarily p) implies the corresponding theorem about the dynamical system described by the QDE. Therefore, at least for universals, statements in temporal logic about continuous systems can be proved by qualitative simulation. This allows a hybrid reasoning system to prove such common-sense statements as "what goes up (in a constant gravitational field) must come down", or to do such expert reasoning about dynamical systems as proving the stability of a nonlinear, heterogeneous controller.
