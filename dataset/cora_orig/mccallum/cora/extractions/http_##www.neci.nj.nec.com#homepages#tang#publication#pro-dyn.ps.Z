Abstract: In the framework of a lattice-model study of protein folding, we investigate the interplay between designability, thermodynamic stability, and kinetics. To be "protein-like", heteropolymers must be thermodynamically stable, stable against mutating the amino-acid sequence, and must be fast folders. We find two criteria which, together, guarantee that a sequence will be "protein like": i) the ground state is a highly designable stucture, i. e. the native structure is the ground state of a large number of sequences, and ii) the sequence has a large = ratio, being the average energy separation between the ground state and the excited compact conformations, and the dispersion in energy of excited compact conformations. These two criteria are not incompatible since, on average, sequences whose ground states are highly designable structures have large = values. These two criteria require knowledge only of the compact-state spectrum. These claims are substantiated by the study of 45 sequences, with various values of = and various degrees of designability, by means of a Borst-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, and the Ferrenberg-Swendsen histogram optimization method. Finally, we report on the reasons for slow folding. A comparison between a very slow folding sequence, an average folding one and a fast folding one suggests that slow folding originates from a proliferation of nearly compact low-energy conformations, not present for fast folders. fl U.P.R. 5001 du CNRS

Reference-contexts: For a heteropolymer to be "protein like", three requirements must be met: (i) The heteropolymer must be thermodynamically stable: at thermal equilibrium, it must spend a large fraction of its time in the ground state. (Anfissen <ref> [1] </ref> has shown the ground state of a protein to be the biologically active configuration.) (ii) The heteropolymer must have a fast folding time: the native state should be kinetically accessible, typically within milliseconds to seconds for real proteins. (iii) The "protein-like" heteropolymer must be stable against mutations: if an amino

However, for the model we simulated, this algorithm spends most of the time refusing moves, leading to large computation times. Hence, we chose to implement a Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz (BKL) type algorithm [15], an algorithm especially efficient in the presence of slow relaxation. <p> Since, in practice, we could not apply this exact method to 27-mers in three dimensions, we have used Monte-Carlo histogram techniques to study the thermodynamics. Several groups working on proteins have rediscovered the Monte-Carlo histogram technique and applied it to heteropolymer models of proteins. We refer the reader to <ref> [7] </ref> for a clear description of this technique. <p> We will use the width of this transition as a measure of thermodynamic stablility, the thermodynamically stable sequences having a narrow transition. The first-order-like behavior of the folding transition was put on a quantitative basis for a lattice H-P model by Socci and Onuchic <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> Our definition of thermodynamic stability is thus, in the context of real proteins, only a necessary condition. Following Socci and Onuchic <ref> [7] </ref>, we employ the optimized histogram method described in section 2.2.2, and determine the probability P 25 (T ) that the sequence is in any conformation having more than 25 correct ground-state contacts, or "native" contacts, out of 28 possible contacts for the fully folded structure.

Reference-contexts: The small number of possible interactions in an H-P model (H-H, H-P, and P-P) and the finite number of possible sequences of a given length provide realistic constraints on the design of particular structures. Li et al. <ref> [13] </ref> took advantage of these constraints to study some design properties of an H-P model in the complete space of possible sequences. In particular these authors introduced the concept of designability. <p> These observations suggest that Nature's selection of protein structures is not accidental but a consequence 1 of thermodynamic stability and stability against mutations. The aim of the present article is to push further the analysis of Li et al.. In particular, the study in <ref> [13] </ref> is limited to the compact-state spectra of H-P heteropolymers of 27 monomers length (the compact states of which fill a 3fi3fi3 cube), and the dynamical aspects are not discussed. Here we address thermodynamic and dynamic properties including all states, not only the compact ones. <p> Here we address thermodynamic and dynamic properties including all states, not only the compact ones. Of course, our present study is therefore limited to a small number of sequences (45), in contrast to the complete enumeration in <ref> [13] </ref>. More precisely, we address the following questions: * (i) In the compact-state-spectrum studies, thermodynamic stability is measured by the gap in the compact-state spectrum. By gap, we mean the energy difference between the first excited compact state (s) and the ground compact state. <p> Is the postulate right or wrong for H-P heteropolymers? * (iii) Are highly designable structures also fast folders ? Sequences that have highly designable ground states and thus are stable against mutations are also typically thermodynamically stable according to the analysis of the compact-state spectrum carried out in Ref. <ref> [13] </ref>. Moreover, Vendruscolo et al. [14] showed, in different lattice models, that both types of stability are equivalent. One would like to know whether the requirement of fast folding dynamics introduces new constraints on the set of "protein-like" sequences. <p> Section 5 summarizes our answers to the questions presented above. 2 Model and simulation techniques The aim of this section is to briefly recall the definition of the heteropolymer H-P model, and to describe the simulation techniques. 2 2.1 The model In the model analyzed in <ref> [13] </ref>, a protein is a self-avoiding walk of monomers on a cubic lattice. <p> This last condition expresses the fact that different types of monomers tend to segregate. Following <ref> [13] </ref>, we choose E H;H = 2:3 E C , E H;P = 1 E C and E P;P = E C . These dimensionless coefficients define the energy scale in which the temperature will be measured. <p> These dimensionless coefficients define the energy scale in which the temperature will be measured. An increase of the compactness energy E C tends to favor compact conformations with respect to open ones. The results of <ref> [13] </ref> concerning the compact state spectrum are of course independent of E C . In the present work, the open, partially open, and compact states are all taken into account in the numerical calculations, so that the results presented here depend on E C . <p> n ): (6) Once (5) and (6) have been solved by successive iterations, the average of an energy-dependent operator is calculated as hO (E)i = E O (E)P (E; T ) E P (E; T ) 3 Thermodynamics The compact state spectrum was previously determined by means of exact enumerations <ref> [13] </ref>. Thanks to this work, we know for each sequence the lowest energy compact state. However, it is possible that the true ground state is not compact. We therefore checked during the histogram calculations that no open state has a lower energy than the compact ground state. <p> constant at ' 2, and therefore alone is also a good predictor of thermodynamic stability. 3.3 Thermodynamic stability versus designability The designability of a given structure is measured in terms of the number N S of sequences that have this structure as their nondegenerate ground state, and, as proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>, the sequences corresponding to highly designable structures should be "protein-like". Interestingly, the highly designable structures show regular helix-like and fi-sheet-like patterns [13], quite reminiscent of the regular patterns in real proteins. Moreover, since these highly designable structures have on average a large gap to their first compact excited state [13], <p> of a given structure is measured in terms of the number N S of sequences that have this structure as their nondegenerate ground state, and, as proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>, the sequences corresponding to highly designable structures should be "protein-like". Interestingly, the highly designable structures show regular helix-like and fi-sheet-like patterns [13], quite reminiscent of the regular patterns in real proteins.

Moreover, since these highly designable structures have on average a large gap to their first compact excited state [13], they are likely to be thermodynamically stable. More specifically, the average gap in the compact state spectrum suddenly jumps from a low value to a high value as N S increases above N S ~ 1400. <p> The authors analyzed the two dimensional case of the present model with 16 monomer chains and exactly enumerated not only all the possible compact but also all the possible open state conformations. They found first, in agreement with Li et al. <ref> [13] </ref>, a broad distribution of N S . 11 line) and a structure with N S = 300 (dashed line). Each bin has a width of 0:05 in = and the quantity on the y axis measures how many sequences fall in each bin. <p> We have also compared the states hit in the folding simulation to the complete set of compact low-energy states with an energy E &lt; E hit = 0:5 (known from the compact-state enumeration <ref> [13] </ref>). In the case of sequence C, we found that all 12 low-energy states in Table 1 are indeed compact, and correspond exactly to all the compact states with an energy E &lt; E hit = 0:5. <p> Finally, we make a few remarks to illustrate the magnitude of structure and sequence selection. We started from a set of 2 27 sequences, only 4:75% (approximately 6; 000; 000) of these having a nondegenerate compact ground-state <ref> [13] </ref> structure. The total number of possible compact structures is 51; 704 [13].

The 60 highly designable structures are designed by a total of 128; 320 sequences, only 15% of which have = &gt; 4:3 and are thus expected to be "protein-like" folders. In summary, only about 0:01% of the initial 2 27 sequences satisfy all the requirements for "protein-like" behavior.

Reference-contexts: We did not in fact use this "naive" histogram technique but rather made use of the powerful method invented by Ferrenberg and Swendsen <ref> [16, 17] </ref>. This method consists in optimizing several histograms calculated at different temperatures to obtain the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic quantities. Moreover, the accuracy of the optimized thermodynamic quantities can be evaluated, and additional simulations can be carried out when necessary.

Reference-contexts: As stated in the introduction, one necessary condition for a sequence to be "protein-like" is that it be thermodynamically stable. Hence, we have to find a quantitative way to measure thermal stability. It has been proposed <ref> [18] </ref> that real proteins undergo a folding transition at some temperature T f larger than the glass transition T g , below which the dynamics dramatically freezes. <p> what follows. 3.2 Thermodynamic stability: compact state spectrum versus transition width In order to answer the first question in item (i) in the introductory section, we want to compare the compact-state-spectrum estimation of the thermodynamic stability, in terms of the folding temperature T f and the glass-transition temperature T g <ref> [18, 20] </ref>, to the thermodynamic stability estimated with the method of section 3.1. 3.2.1 Compact-state-spectrum results We first review the results of Goldstein et al.

Reference-contexts: This assumption speeds up computations and is sensible from the point of view of real proteins since structure fluctuations around the folded conformation are expected, and do not prevent the protein from being functional (see for instance <ref> [19] </ref>). The variation of P 25 (T ) as a function of temperature T are shown on Fig. 2 for the thermodynamically stable sequence A and the thermodynamically unstable sequence C. [These two sequences will be studied in detail in the present article].

Reference-contexts: These sequences, despite high designability, have a small value of =. Such sequences are expected to emerge due to the fact that, even for a structure with large N S , the ratio = is not necessarily large for all sequences having that structure as a ground state <ref> [21] </ref>. In other words, it is possible to find atypical sequences with a low value of = even for structures with a large N S .

Reference-contexts: However, they showed that the thermodynamic stability is flat as a function of N S , in contradiction with our present results, and also in contradiction with unpublished data <ref> [22] </ref> where the gap in the compact state spectrum in two dimensions was shown to increase as a function of N S .

Reference-contexts: Compared to other works where models with a faster folding time were investigated, this occupancy of the native states is quite small. For instance, Abkevich et al. <ref> [23] </ref> could fold a few sequences at a temperature for which the average similarity with ground state was up to 95%. <p> the sequences with small = ratio will increase much more rapidly than the folding time of the sequences with large = ratio. 15 The conclusion regarding the variations of the average folding times as a function of the native--states occupancy is similar to the one reached by Abkevich et al. <ref> [23] </ref>, who proposed that the gap in the compact-state spectrum correlates with the average folding time calculated for large native-states occupancy. 4.2 Slow versus fast folding Despite the complexity of protein energy landscapes, several authors have proposed simple effective descriptions of these landscapes.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the role of traps (or folding intermediates) in the folding process was underlined by several authors, for instance by Bryngelson and Wolynes [24] and by Klimov and Thirumalai [6]. A scenario was proposed by Bryngelson et al. <ref> [25] </ref> in which there exists a "folding pathway" to the native state: in a first step, the protein collapses via many possible paths in phase space, and, in a second step, folds to the native structure via a small number of possible paths.

Reference-contexts: Abkevich et al. found evidence for a nucleation process in a lattice model study <ref> [26] </ref>. The aim of the present section is to see if there exists any simple scenario in our H-P model. Among all the sequences analyzed here at a P f = 10% occupancy of native states, one sequence has an anomalously long folding time, approximatively 4 fi 10 9 MCS.
