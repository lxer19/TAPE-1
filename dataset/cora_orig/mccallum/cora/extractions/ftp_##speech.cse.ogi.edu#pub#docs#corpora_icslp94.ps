Abstract: This paper describes eight telephone-speech corpora at various stages of development at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding. For each corpus we describe data collection procedures, methods of soliciting callers, protocol used to collect the data, transcriptions that accompany the speech data, and the expected release date. The corpora are (or will be) available at no charge to academic institutions.

Reference-contexts: We are also using an Apple GeoPort Telecom Adapter connected to a Macintosh Quadra A/V to collect analog speech data for one of the corpora to be described. 1 This article is an updated version of a report published in <ref> [1] </ref>. We publish this updated report here to reach a wider audience. Transcription. Each call is processed by one or more listeners. Responses are verified to determine that the caller followed instructions; some are also transcribed.

Reference-contexts: Time-aligned phonetic transcriptions align phonetic symbols to the acoustic signal. A precise description of the conventions used for all levels of labeling, including a complete list of all phonetic labels for each language, is presented in the CSLU conventions document <ref> [2] </ref>. Transcription Reliability. We are conducting experiments to determine the level of agreement among labelers. In these experiments, CSLU staff and professional phoneticians are using Worldbet [3] to transcribe the same intervals of speech. Initial results for English indicate overall agreement of approximately 70%. Speech Tools. <p> For the phonetic transcriptions, we have adopted the World-bet labeling scheme, a set of orthographic symbols for multi-language transcription that correspond to IPA symbols. The rationale for using Worldbet and the symbol inventory for each language is provided in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.3. Stories Corpus Collection for the OGI Multi-Language Corpus produced additional calls from English speakers not included in the Multi-Language Corpus. The Stories Corpus consists of up to 50 sec of spontaneous speech from the "stories" response of 692 English calls.

Reference-contexts: All data are stored in the NIST wav file format, some with MIT shortpack compression. The remaining corpora are under development and estimated release dates are provided for each. 2.1. Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus The Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus <ref> [5] </ref> contains utterances from 3667 calls. Callers were solicited through computer newsgroups and a public relations campaign initiated by OGI. The majority of callers were from the Pacific Northwest. The proportion of male to female callers is 1.15 to 1.

Reference-contexts: The utterances were labeled by hand, then labels and time-alignments with the speech spectrogram were verified by an expert spectrogram reader. The phonetically labeled data include 100 alphabets, 2052 city names, 100 spoken names and 300 spelled last names. 2.2. Enhanced OGI Multi-Language Corpus The OGI Multi-Language Telephone-Speech Corpus <ref> [6] </ref> consists of telephone-speech from 10 languages: English, Farsi, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil and Vietnamese. The initial corpus included 900 calls|90 calls for each language. Callers were solicited through computer newsgroups.
