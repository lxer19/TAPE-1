Reference-contexts: Navigational experiments using our mobile robot have been conducted in several locales, including the interior of buildings, outdoor campus settings, and manufacturing environments <ref> [8] </ref>. Our system exploits several forms of knowledge representation: a priori world maps and landmark models, dynamically acquired spatial occupancy maps in a local context, and collections of intelligent motor behaviors and perceptual strategies (schemas) which are selected, parameterized, and instantiated in a manner consistent with available knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Much of our work has been and continues to be influenced by psychological and neuroscientific studies <ref> [9] </ref>. Although complete integration of the hierarchical planner (consisting of a mission planner, navigator and pilot) remains to be accomplished, the mechanisms for behavior selection and modulation are in place. The mission planner is concerned with the high-level broad-brush concerns of the robot's mission.

Reference-contexts: Although this method has arguably provided the most successful demonstrations of autonomous behavior to date, it is lacking in its ability to incorporate world knowledge and alterations in user intent based upon changes in environmental circumstances and internal conditions. Even though early models of the subsumption architecture <ref> [10] </ref> did provide for the integration of world models, it is our position that a better approach involves a synthesis of hierarchical planning and reactive control. Several other navigational systems using reactive planning have been developed. <p> This model incorporates aspects of both vertical and horizontal control threads (in a similar sense as Brooks' use <ref> [10] </ref>). Multiple horizontal behaviors are mediated by vertical threads which interconnect the various behaviors and allow for their dynamic modulation as a result of attentional resources (planning, troubleshooting, etc.). The schemas are triggered by perceptual events but modulated by attentional processes.

Reference-contexts: These researchers remain unconcerned with the existing solutions found in biological systems and believe that they should not be constrained by or concerned with such methods. A representative transcendental engineering example is found in the work involving high-speed dynamic control for automatic road-following proceeding in Dickmann's group at Munich <ref> [11] </ref>. Although arguments against relying on biological systems for potential solutions can be made (e.g., robots use fundamentally different hardware, evolution is perhaps not the best instructor) we nonetheless are convinced that much insight can be gained by an understanding of the machinations of biological systems.

Reference-contexts: There are several instances where the coordination of locomotion is determined by autorhythmic neurons that are used for motor action pattern making (e.g., in the beating of fins in fish). Motor neurons, whose firing is invoked from higher level neural processing, activate these automatic behavioral patterns <ref> [12] </ref>. Experimental studies by Humphrey [16] at Emory University have elucidated the interconnection between low-level local motor control and its modulation by higher level processing.

Reference-contexts: At the lowest levels, rapid real-time response is required, but the planner is only concerned with its immediate surroundings and has lost sight of the "big picture". Meystel <ref> [18] </ref> has developed a theory for hierarchical planning which emphasizes the significance of scope and invokes the concept of nested controllers. 2.1.2 The Reactive School Brooks' subsumption architecture is perhaps the first and best known representative of the reactive school of navigational planning.

Reference-contexts: Norman and Shallice <ref> [19] </ref> have enumerated the characteristics of tasks requiring willed control (deliberate attentional resources): * Planning (decision-making) * Troubleshooting * Novel or poorly learned actions (non-reflexive) * Dangerous or difficult actions * Overcoming habit or temptation Other motor actions are typically automatic (reactive) and can occur without attention. <p> Our research will continue in the hopes of discovering the true synergism that can exist between these superficially different paradigms. Integration of new models of behavior (e.g., the Norman-Shallice model (Sec. 3.1.2 <ref> [19] </ref>) can provide a firm foundation to build upon.

Reference-contexts: A contention scheduling mechanism for multiple active motor schemas models the production of co-ordinated behavior. Higher level processes involving attention, alter the threshold values for schemas (loosely translated as basic behaviors), dynamically changing the interplay between them. (Psychological support for schema use in a strictly horizontal manner is well-established <ref> [23] </ref>). This model incorporates aspects of both vertical and horizontal control threads (in a similar sense as Brooks' use [10]). Multiple horizontal behaviors are mediated by vertical threads which interconnect the various behaviors and allow for their dynamic modulation as a result of attentional resources (planning, troubleshooting, etc.).

Reference-contexts: is also important to be flexible in our use of the models developed by scientists in other fields, as our goal is not to create artificial duplicates of existing creatures, but instead functioning autonomous agents that may have some behavioral overlap with their biological counterparts. 3.1.1 Psychological evidence Psychological studies <ref> [24] </ref> have indicated the existence of two distinct modes of behavior: willed (controlled) and automatic.
