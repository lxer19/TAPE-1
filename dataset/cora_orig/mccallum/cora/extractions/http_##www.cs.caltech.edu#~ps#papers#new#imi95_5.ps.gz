Title: Building Your Own Wavelets at Home  
Author: Wim Sweldens Peter Schr oder 
Abstract: We give an practical overview of three simple techniques to construct wavelets under general circumstances: interpolating subdivision, average interpolation, and lifting. We include examples concerning the construction of wavelets on an interval, weighted wavelets, and wavelets adapted to irregular samples.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is then to choose, from the set of available samples j;k , those N which are closest to the new coefficient j+1;l . To be concrete, take the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In the interpolating case we have 2 j + 1 coefficients j;k at locations k 2 j for 0 6 k 6 2 j . <p> We will always assume the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a weight function w (x), and possibly irregular samples x j;k . The coarsest level will be denoted j = 0. The index k ranges from 0 to 2 j in the interpolation case and from 0 to 2 j 1 in the average-interpolation case.

Reference-contexts: In fact, as pointed out in [32] the wavelet we just constructed is precisely the (2; 2) biorthogonal wavelet of Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau <ref> [8] </ref>. If so needed, one can use more neighboring scaling functions in the lifting of the wavelets to assure preservation of higher moments. 2. One advantage of the lifting scheme is that one never has to explicitly form the filters needed to smooth the j+1;l values before subsampling.

Compact support: '(x) is exactly zero outside the interval [N + 1; N ]. This easily follows from the locality of the subdivision scheme. 2. <p> Smoothness: '(x) is continuous of order R, with R = R (N ) &gt; 0. One can show that R (3) &gt; :678, R (5) &gt; 1:272, R (7) &gt; 1:826, R (9) &gt; 2:354, and asymptotically R (N ) :2075N <ref> [17] </ref>. 6. Refinability: '(x) satisfies a refinement relation of the form '(x) = l=N+1 This follows from similar reasoning as in the interpolating case starting from k;0 = ffi k;0 .

Reference-contexts: A weighted inner product of two functions f and g is defined as hf; gi = w (x) f (x) g (x) dx; where w (x) is some positive function. Weighted wavelets are extremely useful in the solution of boundary value ODEs, see <ref> [23, 31] </ref>. Also, as we will see later, they are useful in the approximation of functions with singularities. 3. Irregular samples: In many practical applications, the samples do not necessarily live on a regular grid. Resampling is awkward. A basis adapted to the irregular grid is desired.

Reference-contexts: The new sample value is then simply given by the evaluation of this polynomial at the new, refined location. A particularly efficient (and stable) procedure for this is Neville's algorithm <ref> [30, 27] </ref>. Notice also that nothing in the definition of this procedure requires the original samples to be located at integers. Later we will use this feature to define scaling functions over irregular subdivisions. Interval boundaries for finite sequences are also easily accommodated. <p> The examples were generated with a simple C code whose implementation is a direct transliteration of the algorithms described above. The only essential piece of code imported was an implementation of Neville's algorithm from Numerical Recipes <ref> [27] </ref>. All examples were computed on the unit interval, that is all constructions are adapted to the boundary as described earlier. The only code modification to accommodate this is to insure that the moving window of coefficients does not cross the left or right end point of the interval.

Reference-contexts: Most of the techniques presented here such as polynomial subdivision and lifting extend easily to much more general sets. In particular domains in R n , curves, surfaces, and manifolds. One example is the construction of wavelets on the sphere <ref> [28] </ref>. There we use the lifting scheme to construct locally supported, biorthogonal spherical wavelets and their associated fast transforms. The construction starts from a recursive triangulation of the sphere and is parameterization independent.

The case of irregular samples can also be accommodated by observing that neither of the subdivision schemes requires samples on a regular grid. We can take an arbitrarily spaced set of points x j;k with x j+1;2k = x j;k and x j;k &lt; x j;k+1 .

None of the techniques, interpolating subdivision [15], average interpolation [17], and lifting <ref> [33, 32] </ref>, are new, but taken together they result in a straightforward and easy to implement toolkit. To make the treatment as accessible as possible we will take a very nuts and bolts, algorithmic approach. <p> In this section we introduce the lifting scheme <ref> [33, 32] </ref> a general technique for constructing biorthogonal second generation wavelets. In fact it is so general, that even the subdivision schemes we studied earlier can be seen as a special case of it. <p> Notes: 1. Because of symmetry not only the integral of the wavelet is zero, but also its first moment, Z 18 Thus also the first moment of the approximations is preserved. In fact, as pointed out in <ref> [32] </ref> the wavelet we just constructed is precisely the (2; 2) biorthogonal wavelet of Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau [8]. If so needed, one can use more neighboring scaling functions in the lifting of the wavelets to assure preservation of higher moments. 2. <p> We will come back to this in a later section. 3. Actually the easiest choice for the coefficients would have been j;k = j+1;2k and fl j;m = j+1;2m+1 . This choice is called the Lazy wavelet transform <ref> [32] </ref>. The name Lazy comes from the fact that this transform doesn't really do anything but subsampling the odd samples. We only mention here that any interpolating subdivision scheme can be seen as the result of applying dual lifting to the Lazy wavelet. 4. <p> They have been working (independently from <ref> [33, 32] </ref>) on a scheme which is very similar to the lifting scheme [3, 11]. In particular, Dahmen shows in [10] which properties in addition to biorthogonality are needed to assure stable bases.
