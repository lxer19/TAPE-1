Abstract: This document tries to define and characterize a class of applications called Multi-Party Interactive Multimedia (MIM), for which many examples are given. This class includes applications such as CSCW, teleconferencing, and remote education; its consideration in this report is based on the observation that MIM applications are both important and representative for the area of high-performance real-time communication. Purely functional criteria are used to capture the MIM class, i.e. ones that are not related to any particular way of implementation. Thus, future directions are sketched that give some indications on what a network architecture will need to provide, in order to effectively support such applications.

Reference-contexts: Since the target environment is often that of technical and commercial enterprises, access control has usually to be enforced. Another example is the so-called Virtual Cafe. The idea is to allow users at different sites to communicate informally through an electronic common space <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 Tab.2 Functional Characteristics of Selected MIM Applications However, due to the informal nature of this model, access control is generally not of concern and scheduling is usually limited to the specification of some "opening hours".

Reference-contexts: Such services should be specifiable in purely functional terms, i.e. without reference to any particular implementation. Other proposals have been presented in the literature for the classification of MIM applications from the viewpoint of the support they require from the communication subsystem <ref> [2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14] </ref>. In this report we propose a different approach to such classification based on the identification of a set of basic functional characteristics that this class of multimedia applications exhibits.

Reference-contexts: This functionality also requires the availability of load-balancing capabilities. All the above mentioned functionalities are being considered as the basis for the design of a client-network interface, whose complexity increases dramatically when the network is able to offer quality of service in real-time communication <ref> [3] </ref>; some of these functionalities, however, are intended to be accessible only to a subset of the application participants or to the network administrators. 7 Directions for Future Research In the previous sections we have listed the functionality that should be provided by a communication network to effectively support MIM applications.

Reference-contexts: The network should provide mechanisms for: traffic requirement specification (e.g. minimum and average throughput, burstiness), performance requirement specification (e.g. delay and jitter bounds), synchronization control (e.g. among destinations and among different media), reliability specification (e.g. loss probabilities and fault-tolerance requirements). We believe that the approach proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> to providing guaranteed quality of service for uni-cast real-time channels can be successfully extended to multi-party, multimedia 10 communications. * Security Mechanisms: Mechanisms should be provided to help network clients manage security and accessibility of MIM applications. * Scalability and Optimization: MIM applications involve a number of different media, connecting

Reference-contexts: A participant typically is a human being; however, we believe that our classification might be extended to consider also non-human participants, as is the case of some multimedia applications such as teleprogramming <ref> [5] </ref> and multimedia database access [12].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Among real-time multimedia applications, those requiring (and providing) interaction among a number of parties via a combination of communication media are of great interest to the network research community, because of their particular network support requirements. These applications, which may be called multi-party interactive multimedia (MIM) <ref> [8] </ref>, ask for the availability of a communication system able to efficiently support the amount of data transfer they need, and do so with a client-specified quality of service (QoS).
