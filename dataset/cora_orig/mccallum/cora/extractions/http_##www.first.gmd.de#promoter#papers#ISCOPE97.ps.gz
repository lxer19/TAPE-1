Abstract: This paper presents an objectoriented approach to a high--level programming language for parallel scientific computing and its realization by the compilation and runtime system PROMOTER. At its language level, PROMOTER supports a relaxed data parallel, aggregate object model, extending the usual features of objectorientation to its new concepts for specifying and operating on aggregate or distributed objects and data transfer (communication) in between. PROMOTERs runtime system is realized as a generic class library, which efficiently supports different degrees of symmetry in application structures and dependence patterns. Both runtime system and (coordination) language are based on an imperative, statically typed, objectoriented language

Reference-contexts: The system has been ported to our in-house testbed MANNA, to the IBM SP/2, to the CRAY T3E and to SUN workstation cluster using either ethernet (MPICH) or the Myrinet hardware (MPC++, MTTL <ref> [5] </ref>) for communication. Several optimizations concerning the mapping of aggregate objects, data parallel operations and communication scheduling were tested and implemented. Several applications (CFD, FEM, div. solvers) have been written in PROMOTER. The first experiences proved a good performance and scalability for different problem classes. Fig. 3.
