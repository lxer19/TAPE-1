Reference-contexts: Consequently, researchers have employed more sophisticated techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) [23, 29] and complex equation models [33]. More recently, researchers in recognition have attempted to solve the problem of speech rate variability by normalizing segmental duration <ref> [1, 11, 19] </ref>. However, to date, models which extensively incorporate duration knowledge have not been employed in recognition. The following details some of these approaches. 20 Umeda (1975) [31, 32] studied rules which explain the behaviour of segmental durations. <p> Most HMM systems incorporate a minimal duration model by duplicating or adding states in the model. It is rather difficult to incorporate explicit duration models into the HMM itself, and, as a consequence, researchers <ref> [1, 11, 24, 36] </ref> have attempted to integrate a durational component as a post-processor, yielding some success. <p> Experiments were computed from a 212-word vocabulary using five male and five female speakers. This model resulted in a word accuracy increase of 1.6% in a 212-word vocabulary to 97.3%. Jones (1993) [11] and Anastasakos (1995) <ref> [1] </ref> both used a duration model as a post-processor for an HMM-based recognition system to rescore the N best hypotheses. Duration is modelled explicitly outside the framework of HMMs after the N best algorithm has been used to provide a list of likely hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: Many studies have examined the nature of prepausal lengthening and found that lengthening in the syllable can imply lengthening of some phonemes more than others <ref> [2, 8, 37] </ref>. Wightman et al. [37] reported a study of segmental lengthening in the vicinity of prosodic boundaries and found that it is restricted to the rime of the syllable preceding the boundary. <p> Wightman et al. [37] reported a study of segmental lengthening in the vicinity of prosodic boundaries and found that it is restricted to the rime of the syllable preceding the boundary. Campbell <ref> [2] </ref> found that whereas segments in prepausal sentence-final syllables undergo greater lengthening in the rime than in the onset, segments in sentence-internal syllables are lengthened or compressed (due to stress, rhythmic or other factors) more uniformly across the syllable. <p> Furthermore, Van Santen developed a methodology for analytically fitting such models to data, using analysis of ordinal patterns to determine some functional form and then analytically finding factor scales. Underlying the work of Campbell (1992) <ref> [2, 3] </ref> is the concept that timing in speech can best be represented from the higher levels of the phrase, foot and syllable, and it is only finally realized at the level of the phonetic segment as a result of an interaction with the effects at higher levels.

Reference-contexts: Its influence on segment durations is also not well understood. In general, pauses make up about 20% of the time in fluent reading and 50% in conversation. Crystal <ref> [5] </ref> found that slowing down in speech can be attributed to the introduction of new pauses (54%), increased duration of existing pauses (27%) and increased duration of speech segments (19%), tempo being measured by the total elapsed time. <p> Many studies have shown that the duration of unstressed syllables is proportionally more affected by rate changes than that of stressed syllables <ref> [5, 22, 25] </ref>. <p> A large source of variability in segmental duration can be attributed to speaker differences. Such differences may be larger than the contextual constraints observed for the speech of a single speaker <ref> [5] </ref>. Wang et al. [24, 35] found that much more variation is introduced when examining data from a multi-speaker corpus such as TIMIT.

Reference-contexts: One study [22] found the influence of the initial consonant on the duration of the syllable nucleus 2 Throughout this thesis, we will use the ARPAbet nomenclature for phonetic units. 16 to be negligible, while another <ref> [6] </ref> reports that vowels are longer following stops than following other consonants. <p> For example, in a vowel-nasal-obstruent sequence, voicing of the obstruent is associated with lengthening of both the vowel and the nasal <ref> [6, 25] </ref>. * The correlation between the number of syllables in a word and segmental duration is not well understood. <p> Geminates in general are longer than one single phoneme but shorter than the sum of two. Duration is an important cue for their detection. Further details of contextual effects can be found in <ref> [6, 31, 32] </ref>. 1.2.2 Lexical Component Segmental duration is affected by position in the word, and duration is used perceptually to distinguish two words which differ by lexical stress patterns. <p> For example, unstressed vowels which are often reduced may occur in word-final positions. In this case, these reduced vowels are also subject to lengthening. Front vowels are shorter than back vowels when preceding labial or dental consonants but are longer when preceding velars <ref> [6] </ref>. A large source of variability in segmental duration can be attributed to speaker differences. Such differences may be larger than the contextual constraints observed for the speech of a single speaker [5]. <p> They also found that changes in overall speech rate alter segmental durations non-uniformly over a number of neighbouring segment types and this reduces the effectiveness of uniform scaling to eliminate tempo variation. Crystal and House (1988) <ref> [6] </ref> developed duration models which were incorporated into a hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognition system. They analyzed segment duration data for two 300-word passages read by each of six speakers of American English and then computed statistics for context-dependent phoneme segments. <p> These can be computed from the mean () and standard deviation () of the training data as follows: ff = 2 = 2 ; = = 2 (3.2) The Gamma pdf has been used in past duration modelling experiments <ref> [6] </ref>. Its properties are well-suited for modelling duration. Unlike the Gaussian pdf, the Gamma pdf is not symmetic, with the independent variable being strictly non-negative, and displaying a longer tail that extends towards infinity, as exhibited by many duration histograms.

Wightman et al. [37] reported a study of segmental lengthening in the vicinity of prosodic boundaries and found that it is restricted to the rime of the syllable preceding the boundary. <p> In addition to speaking rate, it has been postulated that speakers aim to maintain a certain rhythmicity although there is no conclusive evidence about the influence of rhythm and the constraints that it imposes on segmental duration <ref> [8] </ref>. 1.2.5 Discourse Level Little is known about duration at a discourse level, although it may appear that speakers slow down at the end of conceptual units while emphasis and contrastive stress tend to increase duration by 10-20% [13].

Reference-contexts: It has been observed that, in carrier-phrase mode, vowel and consonant duration can decrease as the number of syllables in a word increases <ref> [9, 12, 25] </ref> but this effect becomes obscure in more natural speech settings. * Gemination is the phenomenon where two identical phonemes such as nasals or fricatives occur adjacent to each other [23]. <p> Stressed vowels are known to be longer than unstressed vowels [26] whereas consonants in pre-stressed positions are often longer than their unstressed and post-stressed counterparts [13]. Word-final lengthening has been observed by some but not others <ref> [9] </ref>. 17 1.2.3 Syntactic Structure Duration is influenced by syntactic structure, such as phrasal and clausal patterns. Vowels in syllables preceding phrase boundaries have been found to be twice as long as vowels in non-phrase-final syllables.

Reference-contexts: Some of these effects are listed below. * In general, vowels can be divided into contrastive long-short pairs or tense-lax opposition.

These are described below. * House <ref> [10] </ref> claimed that the primary influence on vowel duration is attributed to the voicing characteristic of the following consonant. Numerous others have demonstrated that vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants than when followed by voiced consonants [13, 20, 22].

Reference-contexts: Also, vowel durations tend to vary inversely with vocalic height [20]. * For fricatives, those which are voiceless, /s, sh, f, th/ are about 40ms longer than their voiced counterparts, /z, zh, v, dh/ <ref> [13] </ref>. * For voiced stops /b, g, d/, the duration of releases as well as the voice onset time (VOT) are inherently shorter than those of voiceless stops /p, k, t/. Labial stop closures are generally longer than alveolar closures [13]. <p> 40ms longer than their voiced counterparts, /z, zh, v, dh/ <ref> [13] </ref>. * For voiced stops /b, g, d/, the duration of releases as well as the voice onset time (VOT) are inherently shorter than those of voiceless stops /p, k, t/. Labial stop closures are generally longer than alveolar closures [13]. Contextual Effects The intrinsic duration of a phonetic segment is often perturbed under varying contextual conditions; that is, the identity of neighbouring segments exerts some influence on the phone duration. <p> These are described below. * House [10] claimed that the primary influence on vowel duration is attributed to the voicing characteristic of the following consonant. Numerous others have demonstrated that vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants than when followed by voiced consonants <ref> [13, 20, 22] </ref>. Van Santen found differences of 100ms for vowel durations when followed by voiced and voiceless consonants for a single speaker [33]. In fact, vowel duration is perceptually important for humans to detect the presence of voicing in post-vocalic consonants [16]. <p> Stressed vowels are known to be longer than unstressed vowels [26] whereas consonants in pre-stressed positions are often longer than their unstressed and post-stressed counterparts <ref> [13] </ref>. Word-final lengthening has been observed by some but not others [9]. 17 1.2.3 Syntactic Structure Duration is influenced by syntactic structure, such as phrasal and clausal patterns. Vowels in syllables preceding phrase boundaries have been found to be twice as long as vowels in non-phrase-final syllables. <p> Vowels in syllables preceding phrase boundaries have been found to be twice as long as vowels in non-phrase-final syllables. This lengthening occurs at phrase or clause boundaries even when there is no physical pause in the acoustic signal, and vowels exhibit more lengthening than consonants <ref> [13, 31, 32] </ref>. Prepausal lengthening is the effect where segments followed by pauses are lengthened in duration. Studies report a 60-200ms increase in syllable duration with most of the durational increment restricted to the vowel and any postvocalic sonorant or fricative consonants [13]. <p> Prepausal lengthening is the effect where segments followed by pauses are lengthened in duration.

The first duration model to appear in the literature <ref> [13] </ref> was a sequential rule-based system which addresses one or two factors at a time but fails to capture the more complex interactions. Consequently, researchers have employed more sophisticated techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) [23, 29] and complex equation models [33]. <p> In the consonant model, separate initial values are computed for the case of the word-initial intervocalic consonant and the word-final intervocalic consonant. Consonant durations are then modified according to different conditions of phonetic context, stress and pause position. Klatt (1976) <ref> [12, 13] </ref> developed a model which specifies a generative theory of segmental duration in which phonetic segments are assumed to have some inherent duration and vowels were strongly incompressible beyond a certain amount of shortening. <p> Only the two-level subtrees which are directly adjacent to the word boundary and therefore, the pause, are considered as prepausal. This is because previous research has suggested that parts of a word which are further away from the pause, such as onsets, exhibit little or no effects <ref> [13] </ref>. Several examples of sublexical patterns from the word and morph layers are chosen to illustrate the extent of lengthening effects on relative duration. Below, the relative duration and total absolute duration are computed for two-level subtree patterns which occur under non-prepausal conditions and "irregular" conditions.

Many studies have examined the nature of prepausal lengthening and found that lengthening in the syllable can imply lengthening of some phonemes more than others [2, 8, 37]. <p> He also incorporated a speaking rate parameter based on the number of words per minute. This model explained 84% of the variance for new paragraphs for the speaker on which the rules were developed. O'Shaughnessy (1984) <ref> [20] </ref> presented a generative model of French durations for synthesis-by-rule. Baseline durations are specified by manner class and effects such as function-word reduction and voicing. These durations are then modified under conditions of phonetic context and word and sentence position. <p> Variance reduction, in the past, has been achieved by explicitly accounting for the large array of contextual factors. For example, Pitrelli [23] derived phoneme standard deviations of 20-30ms in a multiple-speaker corpus. Other results of a comparable nature were derived from using fewer speakers in the corpus <ref> [20] </ref> and so it can be argued that the inherent variabilities were fewer. On the other hand, attempts to reduce variance through speaking rate adjustment have, generally, failed [33]. Our results have served to demonstrate the potential usefulness of rate-normalized absolute duration models. <p> Also any word which has a speaking rate of greater than approximately 5 can be considered to be entirely misaligned. 3.3 Studies Characterizing Prepausal Lengthening In previous reasearch, prepausal lengthening, in both sentence-final and sentence-internal words, has been found to cause significant duration effects <ref> [23, 20, 31] </ref>. However, our understanding of the nature of lengthening is sparse, and little research has been directed towards quantifying lengthening and its characteristics, particularly for recognition purposes.

Reference-contexts: Each keyword has its own additive boost which is determined experimentally to optimize performance.

This is essentially a breadth-first search with beam pruning which maintains computational tractability. At each time point determined by the acoustic-phonetic network, the number of active theories is set to a predetermined N while the rest are pruned. These theories are advanced time-synchronously.

Schwas such as /ix, ax, axr/ 2 are found to be shorter than other vowels such as /iy, ae, aa/ <ref> [10, 22] </ref>. <p> These are described below. * House [10] claimed that the primary influence on vowel duration is attributed to the voicing characteristic of the following consonant. Numerous others have demonstrated that vowels are shorter when followed by voiceless consonants than when followed by voiced consonants <ref> [13, 20, 22] </ref>. Van Santen found differences of 100ms for vowel durations when followed by voiced and voiceless consonants for a single speaker [33]. In fact, vowel duration is perceptually important for humans to detect the presence of voicing in post-vocalic consonants [16]. <p> Van Santen found differences of 100ms for vowel durations when followed by voiced and voiceless consonants for a single speaker [33].

Reference-contexts: in carrier-phrase mode, vowel and consonant duration can decrease as the number of syllables in a word increases [9, 12, 25] but this effect becomes obscure in more natural speech settings. * Gemination is the phenomenon where two identical phonemes such as nasals or fricatives occur adjacent to each other <ref> [23] </ref>. Because their acoustic realization often exhibits a minimal transition or no spectral change at all, they can be viewed as a single phonetic unit representing two phonemes. Geminates in general are longer than one single phoneme but shorter than the sum of two. <p> The first duration model to appear in the literature [13] was a sequential rule-based system which addresses one or two factors at a time but fails to capture the more complex interactions. Consequently, researchers have employed more sophisticated techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) <ref> [23, 29] </ref> and complex equation models [33]. More recently, researchers in recognition have attempted to solve the problem of speech rate variability by normalizing segmental duration [1, 11, 19]. However, to date, models which extensively incorporate duration knowledge have not been employed in recognition. <p> Additionally, speaking rate was calibrated by the duration of two sentences which every speaker was asked to produce. Riley's model produced predictions with residuals of 23ms standard deviation. Pitrelli (1990) <ref> [23] </ref> used a hierarchical model based on phoneme duration. He found that a substantial portion of duration data variance in a large, multi-speaker corpus can be explained by duration modelling. <p> While, no one linguistic unit can completely depict durational information, researchers in the past <ref> [23] </ref> have been faced with the problem of choosing a single appropriate linguistic representation to best capture durational phenomena. Here, by using the Angie structure, we have eliminated that problem. <p> In general, our results indicate that variance reduction due to our combined normalization scheme is large and comparable to the results of previous research. Variance reduction, in the past, has been achieved by explicitly accounting for the large array of contextual factors. For example, Pitrelli <ref> [23] </ref> derived phoneme standard deviations of 20-30ms in a multiple-speaker corpus. Other results of a comparable nature were derived from using fewer speakers in the corpus [20] and so it can be argued that the inherent variabilities were fewer. <p> It is also decided that this ratio is a superior indicator than standard deviation alone because the latter is inherently proportionate with mean duration, that is, longer segments intrinsically have larger standard deviations. This relationship has been established in previous research <ref> [23] </ref> and appears independent of speaking rate. Thus, in the event of slow or fast speech, nodes with large standard deviation to mean values 44 to 13ms. Mean duration is 40ms before and after normalization. to 38ms. <p> Also any word which has a speaking rate of greater than approximately 5 can be considered to be entirely misaligned. 3.3 Studies Characterizing Prepausal Lengthening In previous reasearch, prepausal lengthening, in both sentence-final and sentence-internal words, has been found to cause significant duration effects <ref> [23, 20, 31] </ref>. However, our understanding of the nature of lengthening is sparse, and little research has been directed towards quantifying lengthening and its characteristics, particularly for recognition purposes. <p> Often, candidate hypotheses contain implausible durations proposed by a recognizer because the acoustic-phonetic characteristics are well-matched to the recognizer's models. As a consequence, incorrect words are proposed despite the presence of segments possessing improbable durations. Pitrelli <ref> [23] </ref> analyzed recognition errors and discovered duration as a significant contributor to over half the discrepancies. A duration score will encourage the rejection of faulty segmentations by penalizing unlikely hypotheses and boosting probable ones. In phonetic recognition, however, the recognizer does not have knowledge of a word lexicon.

Reference-contexts: A large source of variability in segmental duration can be attributed to speaker differences. Such differences may be larger than the contextual constraints observed for the speech of a single speaker [5].

Pols <ref> [24] </ref> cites evidence that speakers with a high speaking rate (in terms of number of words per minute) almost unanimously showed a higher word error rate. Osaka et al. (1994) [19] described a spoken word recognition system which adapts to the speaking rate.

Reference-contexts: For example, in a vowel-nasal-obstruent sequence, voicing of the obstruent is associated with lengthening of both the vowel and the nasal <ref> [6, 25] </ref>. * The correlation between the number of syllables in a word and segmental duration is not well understood. <p> It has been observed that, in carrier-phrase mode, vowel and consonant duration can decrease as the number of syllables in a word increases <ref> [9, 12, 25] </ref> but this effect becomes obscure in more natural speech settings. * Gemination is the phenomenon where two identical phonemes such as nasals or fricatives occur adjacent to each other [23]. <p> Many studies have shown that the duration of unstressed syllables is proportionally more affected by rate changes than that of stressed syllables <ref> [5, 22, 25] </ref>.

Stressed vowels are known to be longer than unstressed vowels <ref> [26] </ref> whereas consonants in pre-stressed positions are often longer than their unstressed and post-stressed counterparts [13].

(1988) <ref> [26] </ref> aimed to extract properties in speech suitable for distinguishing words from a small vocabulary, a first step in using duration for speech recognition. They sought to capture linguistically relevant information in timing at the syllable level by examining words produced by different speakers at different speech rates.

Here, we develop a duration model based on the sub-word parse trees provided by Angie with the intention of integrating the duration component with the Angie speech recognizer. <p> Phonological rules are written without specifying context explicitly.

However, in order to extract this information, one must be able to identify and account for all the linguistic factors that operate simultaneously on a segment.

Reference-contexts: Since the vast linguistic information encoded in duration remains largely untapped, performance improvements have thus far been modest, despite the potential for greater gains. This section will detail the history of duration modelling experiments and elaborate on some of the problems encountered. Van Santen <ref> [34] </ref> has identified four categories in duration modelling approaches: sequential rule systems, equation systems, table-lookup systems and binary trees. Most models predict segmental duration at the lowest phoneme-sized level by taking into account explicitly some of the observed contextual effects and their interactions. <p> But it also has several disadvantages.
