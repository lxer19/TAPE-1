Title: Segmenting Time Series using Gated Experts with Simulated Annealing

Abstract: Many real-world time series are multi-stationary, where the underlying data generating process (DGP) switches between different stationary subprocesses, or modes of operation. An important problem in modeling such systems is to discover the underlying switching process, which entails identifying the number of subprocesses and the dynamics of each subprocess. For many time series, this problem is ill-defined, since there are often no obvious means to distinguish the different subprocesses. We discuss the use of nonlinear gated experts to perform the segmentation and system identification of the time series. Unlike standard gated experts methods, however, we use concepts from statistical physics to enhance the segmentation for high-noise problems where only a few experts are required.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction & Problem Statement The gated experts model has been used for time series prediction and segmentation in <ref> [Weigend and Mangeas, 1995] </ref>. In this article, we discuss the problem of segmenting the time series, and show that the model may not correctly identify the number of subprocesses. <p> Although we have the same inputs for the gate and the expert networks, this is not required. 2.2 Expectation-Maximization Search <ref> [Weigend and Mangeas, 1995] </ref> discusses the use of the EM algorithm for the gated experts model. <p> This paper discusses a method to avoid this type of overfitting. M-Step The M-step optimizes the following cost function using the values of h (t) j from the E-step to compute the parameters j , j , and g <ref> [Weigend and Mangeas, 1995] </ref>.
