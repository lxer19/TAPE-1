Title: A Generalization of Brayton-Moser's Mixed Potential Function  
Author: Laurens Weiss, Wolfgang Mathis, and Ljiljana Trajkovic 
Abstract: In this paper we give algorithms for constructing the Brayton-Moser's mixed potential function for a class of nonlinear reciprocal RLC networks, and we state necessary conditions for their existence. We have attempted to find the largest possible class of networks for which such a scalar function of state variables consisting of capacitor voltages and inductor currents can be constructed explicitly. Our results are applicable to a certain subclass of complete networks. From a mathematical point of view, we show that the corresponding network equations belong to the class of index 1 systems.
