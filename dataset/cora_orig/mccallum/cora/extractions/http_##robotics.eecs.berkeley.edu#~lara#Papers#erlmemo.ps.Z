Abstract: Minimally invasive surgical techniques, especially endoscopy and laparoscopy, possess many advantages over conventional methods. These include accelerated patient recovery and reduced rate of complications. However, limitations of current operating instruments create difficulties for the surgeon. In this paper, we present a design for an improved polypectomy snare for the endoscope, several rotary actuator designs for endoscopic tools, and a prototype endo-platform, which provides fine motion control for endoscopic tools. We also present several prototypes of more dextrous laparoscopic tools based on the human hand. Finally, we present a sensory glove designed as a natural and dextrous human interface.

Reference-contexts: There are several problems inherent in these methods of imaging as compared to direct viewing, including loss of depth perception with the two-dimensional view of the operative field, reduced angle of view, reduced resolution, and lack of ability to pan quickly through the scene ([1]; <ref> [2] </ref>, p. 39, p. 85). <p> We also discuss several designs for providing endoscopic tools with rotational control. Additionally, we present a prototype of the endo-platform, a modification of the endoscope which provides fine motion control of the tool. 2.2 Laparoscopy Discussion of laparoscopic techniques can be found in Graber, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, Semm [6], and Saleh [7]. Laparoscopic surgery takes place in an approximately 20 x 20 x 20 cm. workspace inside the patient created by pumping gas into the abdominal cavity.

[2], Semm <ref> [6] </ref>, and Saleh [7]. Laparoscopic surgery takes place in an approximately 20 x 20 x 20 cm. workspace inside the patient created by pumping gas into the abdominal cavity. <p> This type of control likely interferes with a number of reflexes involved in fine manipulation. The lack of dexterity when operating with these instruments makes some tasks, like suturing and knot-tying inside the body cavity, especially difficult ([2], pp. 23-25; <ref> [6] </ref>, p. 98). In addition, the instruments are single-purpose. In order to change from grasping to cutting, for example, one must switch from one instrument to another. In this paper, we present several prototype laparoscopic instruments designed for improved 5 dexterity and versatility.

Reference-contexts: We have several concept designs to provide rotary motion about the tool's axis, although none have been prototyped at this time. The first design uses a high pitch screw in a fixed housing attached to a small piston such as those described in <ref> [8] </ref>; see Figure 2. As the piston pushes or pulls the screw through the housing, the tool rotates. The bellows seal the tool channel and permits its expansion. The housing of the tool needs to be secured to the operating part of the tool.

Reference-contexts: The three tendons are attached to pulleys on DC servomotors with optical position encoders. The endo-platform is capable of 90 degree deflection in any direction.

Reference-contexts: Each finger was comprised of an elongated balloon, ribbed to allow expansion only on the dorsal surface and in a longitudinal direction (see Figure 10). In this way, inflating the finger with air caused it to curl. The design was inspired by the flexible 12 micro-actuator of Suzumori <ref> [11] </ref>. The fingers were built up in layers of molded silicone rubber (Dupont 3112 RTV). The molds were created in machinable wax, using a table-top CNC (computer numerically controlled) mill (Spectralight mill, Light Machines Corp., Nashua, NH). With this technique, we could attain 50 accuracy and 500 line width.

Reference-contexts: Other limitations of this design included the friction and backlash introduced by the joints, the friction due to routing tendons through the hand, and the kinematic problems inherent in tendon-driven serial links <ref> [12] </ref>, as well as potential manufacturing problems. Nevertheless, in the 1 N range, the device displayed surprising capability; under simple marionette-style control, it could grasp and manipulate objects, and the system's frequency response was clearly above the range of the user's hand motions.

Reference-contexts: One of the first questions is whether a non-dextrous controller will suffice for the specific teleoperative system. These devices range in complexity from knobs, joysticks, and teach pendants to universal 6-degree-of-freedom force-reflecting hand controllers (see [23], [20], <ref> [25] </ref>, [22], [26], [27]). For systems with many degrees of freedom or highly anthropomorphic slaves, however, a dextrous master may be required. <p> Force feedback enhances telepresence by presenting information about the magnitude of contact forces in a natural way, while tactile feedback presents information about texture and vibration. The importance of force feedback has been stressed by many authors ([33], <ref> [25] </ref>, [21], [34], [24]), and studies have shown that teleoperative tasks are completed faster or more accurately when the operator has force feedback available ([35], [36], [37], [24], [34]).

None of the commercially available dextrous masters of which we are aware has force feedback. Various prototypes exist, however, and several are discussed by Burdea and Zhuang in [38].

Reference-contexts: master that has been popular for teleoperation applications is the VPL DataGlove TM , which uses flexible optical fibers on the back of a glove to sense the amount of bending of the finger joints; the more a joint flexes, the less light is transmitted through the optical fiber (see <ref> [28] </ref>). The DataGlove measures fourteen degrees of freedom on the hand (see [24], [29], [30]). A second commercially available dextrous master is the Exos Dextrous Hand Master TM (DHM). The DHM is an exoskeleton that attaches to the joints of the hand and uses Hall-effect sensors to measure joint angles. <p> A second commercially available dextrous master is the Exos Dextrous Hand Master TM (DHM). The DHM is an exoskeleton that attaches to the joints of the hand and uses Hall-effect sensors to measure joint angles. It measures a total of sixteen degrees of freedom ([31], <ref> [28] </ref>, [24], [30]). Another commercially available dextrous master is Virtual Technologies' CyberGlove TM , which uses resistive sensors to measure joint angles. The standard CyberGlove measures eighteen degrees of freedom including wrist pitch and yaw. An augmented version of the CyberGlove measures twenty-two degrees of freedom [32].

More detailed calibration data, movement data from all four subjects, and discussion of the calibration procedure and data can be found in <ref> [40] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Preliminary open-loop tests (run at 10 Hz) of the gripper and wrist controls have been promising. The glove has also been tested in simple teleoperative tasks (picking up a small object) with larger fingers equipped with tactile sensors that were developed in our laboratory (see <ref> [41] </ref>). The tactile display, mounted on the first finger of the glove, rendered the force image obtained by the tactile sensors, providing detailed grip force and object position information in real-time.
