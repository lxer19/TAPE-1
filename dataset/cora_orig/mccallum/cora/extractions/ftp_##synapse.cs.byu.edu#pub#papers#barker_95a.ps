Abstract: Machine learning systems often represent concepts or rules as sets of attribute-value pairs. Many learning algorithms generalize or specialize these concept representations by removing or adding pairs. Thus concepts are created that have general to specific relationships. This paper presents algorithms to connect concepts into a network based on their general to specific relationships. Since any concept can access related concepts quickly, the resulting structure allows increased efficiency in learning and reasoning. The time complexity of one set of learning models improves from O(n log n) to O(log n) (where n is the number of nodes) when using the general to specific structure.
