Abstract: We develop a new method for handling incomplete knowledge when inferencing over Bayesian Knowledge Bases(BKB) using genetic algorithms(GA) . The fitness function for a genetic algorithm requires that we give a score to each solution it generates. When a solution is complete, we can use the joint probability of our generated solution, but when incompleteness occurs, the joint probability is undefined. In this paper, we characterize incompleteness in BKBs and present an easily computable method for scoring a solution which contains incompleteness.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A Bayesian Knowledge Base (BKB) is a knowledge representation for information containing uncertainty. BKBs use random variables (RVs) and probabilities to represent knowledge. Unlike other approaches such as Bayesian Networks <ref> [4] </ref>, BKBs are designed to handle incompleteness in our knowledge 2 . One of the inferencing tasks performed on BKBs is belief revision. In belief revision, we attempt to find the most likely state for every variable.

Reference-contexts: Belief revision is the process of determining the most probable state of each of the random variables. A global search algorithm such as genetic algorithms can be adapted to perform belief revision. GALGO <ref> [5] </ref> used GAs to perform belief revision over Bayesian Networks; we use a similar approach to perform belief revision over BKBs.

This technique provides the means to apply existing genetic algorithm inferencing methods such as were used in GALGO <ref> [5] </ref> directly to BKBs by simply installing a new fitness evaluation function. As with Bayesian Networks, genetic algorithm inferencing over BKBs provides a quick approximate result that frequently is very close to the optimal solution.
