Abstract: This report concerns a pilot study of patterns of access to scientific documents made available on the internet, in particular, the WorldWide Web. Its goal is to suggest that the behavior of internet users can be subject to scientific analysis, and further, that the tools of statistical mechanics may be of some value in this analysis. One case studied is a document written according to the traditional model of the scientific article, but made available on the World-Wide Web. The other case is a document written in an intrinsically net-oriented model, and also available on the web. The statistics of access to these documents are rather different. While the first document appears to relax to equilibrium, the second document appears to be in a (self-organized) critical state.

Reference-contexts: These maps show the relationship between fields and subfields and allow one to identify particularly influential publications. In an early study of the dynamics of citation maps, the field of cellular automata was mapped over a period of years <ref> [1] </ref>. The phenomenal spread of the internet has opened new vistas in the study of reference to scientific literature. One now has easily and publicly available a vast storehouse of archives and cross-references. Further, the rate of information flow is such that experimental perturbation is feasible.

Reference-contexts: Without renewal, the useful life of this document is limited. It treats a subject, computer simulation software, which is itself under rapid evolution. Detailed analysis of existing computer programs will necessarily become obsolete within a few years at most. 4 The second document, "Frequently Asked Questions About Cellular Au--tomata", <ref> [2] </ref> is more network-oriented in approach. This document, henceforth referred to as CA-FAQ, contains contributions from many individuals in answer to questions posed by beginners in the field of cellular automata. It is edited by one person, but the editorial hand is applied very lightly.

Reference-contexts: Each contains a significant fraction of information of an objective, data-base character: lists of references, and the like. Nonetheless, there are significant differences in the style, authority, and timeliness of the information presented. The first of these, "Artificial Life Simulators and Their Applications", <ref> [3] </ref> henceforth referred to as AL-SIM, is traditional in approach. It consists mainly of a critical review of various computer programs, packages for simulation in the field of Artificial Life. It contains as well an extensive bibliography and list of hypertext pointers to other, related, documents.

Reference-contexts: Authors have some margin to intervene, by continuously citing their own work <ref> [4] </ref>, for instance. but the process is essentially autonomous. To draw 3 a physical analogy, such documents behavior like a gas: they are released, diffuse, and are finally absorbed into the general cultural substrate.

Reference-contexts: Each develops intuitive models of the dynamics and structure of this flow. The challenge is to find data and methodology which permit rational exploration of these intuitions. One method, developed before the advent of the World Wide Web, relies on the co-citation metric <ref> [5] </ref>. The co-citation metric measures the distance between scientific documents. Two documents are close in this metric if they cite many of the same sources. Using this metric, maps can be built of the landscape of scientific literature. <p> Traditional journal articles have a definite life history. There are published, perhaps cited for a while, and then essentially forgotten qua document. By tracking the record of citations to articles, one can obtain a reasonably precise picture of the "biology" of scientific documents <ref> [5] </ref>. Electronic documents in the first category described above may be expected to obey a life-cycle similar to that of a journal publication.
