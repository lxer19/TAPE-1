Abstract: We describe a new multi-phase, color-based image retrieval system, FOCUS (Fast Object Color-based qUery System), with an online user interface which is capable of identifying multi-colored query objects in an image in the presence of significant, interfering backgrounds. The query object may occur in arbitrary sizes, orientations and locations in the database images. The color features used to describe an image have been developed based on the need for speed in matching and ease of computation on complex images while maintaining the scale and rotation invariance properties. The first phase matches the color content of an image computed as the peaks in the color histogram of the image, with the query object colors using an efficient indexing mechanism. The second phase matches the spatial relationships between color regions in the image with the query using a spatial proximity graph (SPG) structure designed for the purpose. The method is fast and has low storage overhead. Test results with multi-colored query objects from artificial and natural domains show that FOCUS is quite effective in handling interfering backgrounds and large variations in scale. The experimental results on a database of diverse images highlights the capabilities of the system.

Reference-contexts: The main drawbacks of histogram matching when applied to a complex database such as this arises from its sensitivity to scale variations and the presence of similar colored objects in the background. Most of the existing retrieval systems which use color <ref> [9, 1] </ref> are also sensitive to scale and background because they assume that the images to be retrieved are those in which the query object occupies the most prominent part.

Reference-contexts: So pixel level adjacencies are computed for the query colors to maintain the scale invariance property. More details of the query processing phase are available in <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Results The database has 1200 images of various sizes up to 2.5Mb. The overhead incurred in storing the required color information extracted o*ine is about 5% of the size of the database.

Reference-contexts: The simpler problem of finding global similarity between a query image and candidate images based on color has been addressed in <ref> [3, 6, 9, 14] </ref>. However, multi-colored objects often will not occur by themselves in an image. There may be significant, interfering background clutter in the images or the object may occupy a very small portion of the overall image, making global similarity measures unsuitable for retrieval. <p> There has been some work in color-based retrieval in the last six years. The earliest significant work in color-based retrieval is by Swain and Ballard who used color histograms for indexing [14]. More efficient histogram indexing strategies have been developed in <ref> [3, 4] </ref> and a more descriptive histogram-based retrieval has been described in [10]. The main drawbacks of histogram matching when applied to a complex database such as this arises from its sensitivity to scale variations and the presence of similar colored objects in the background. <p> It is also desirable for the feature to be indexable and allow fast matching. Color histograms <ref> [3, 14] </ref>, color clusters [6] and color adjacency graphs [8] are some examples of color features which have been used. None of these color features satisfy all the requirements for a good matching strategy for a retrieval engine.

Reference-contexts: For example, the images shown in Fig.1 are quite typical of the images in the database. An attempt to construct a CAG for these images would produce very large, complex graphs making the matching phase intractable. The spatial description in <ref> [5] </ref> using color partitions is also very computationally intensive when invariance to orientation and position is required. Therefore, we need a simpler representation for the spatial distribution of colors that allows efficient generation and matching for all types of images.

Reference-contexts: For a given query peak P q (h q ; s q ; v q ), we need to find all images which contain a peak in the neighborhood of P q . This requires an order-preserving indexing structure which supports range queries. We have used a B+ tree <ref> [7] </ref> to store the peaks in the database sorted with hue as the primary key, followed by saturation and value. A frequency table is also constructed which gives the number of images which will be retrieved for each point in the discretized HSV space.

None of these color features satisfy all the requirements for a good matching strategy for a retrieval engine. It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a single color feature which will satisfy all the requirements listed above. <p> These false matches could be eliminated if information on spatial distribution of colors in the image was available. The color adjacency graph (CAG) formulation described in <ref> [8] </ref> is a good descriptor of the color relation ships in a multi-colored object where the color regions are nodes in a graph with edges connecting color regions which share an edge at the pixel level.

Reference-contexts: Since describing an image by its histogram peaks is equivalent to the case where very few bins in a histogram have non-zero values, this gives us more discrimination power as shown in <ref> [13] </ref>. The storage space required is reduced and fast matching is possible, when compared to using the full histogram.
