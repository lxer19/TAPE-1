Title: Improvements to GraphPack: A System to Manipulate Graphs and Digraphs  
Author: M. KRISHNAMOORTHY, A.SUESS, M. ONGHENA, F. OXAAL AND T.SPENCER 
Abstract: This paper describes the improvements that we have carried out on GraphPack, the system that we have developed here. These improvements are specifically four fold. We have incorporated GraphPack to communicate with other systems; specifically, Mathematica, Maple, Matlab and SetPlayer. Further, we have incorporated commands to perform graph algorithms on MasPar,a SIMD machine. A lot of display routines are added for different embeddings of graphs. We also incorporated a 3D display of graphs, including rotation and swapping of vertices to get a better embedding. Finally, the language LiLa and the interpreter has been enhanced so as to write application programs easier.

Reference-contexts: In particular, faster operations on graphs are carried out. As far as the authors know, the GraphPack system is comparable to other existing systems such as Combinatorica, NetPad, and GraphView [10][9] <ref> [2] </ref>. This system is slightly better than other projects with a comparable theme of which we are aware; among them, Netsolve and Graphix [3]. Netsolve is a library of procedures; thus, it is of no help to users who want to solve problems that Netsolve does not provide algorithms for.

Graphix, on the other hand, is a collection of primitive operations for graph algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The Kernel of GraphPack, however, also contains elementary set operations; no elementary set operations are supported by Graphix. Graphix does not contain any programs at all. More recently, a user interface for graph and group algorithms was done in Groups and Graphs <ref> [4] </ref>. This system does not provide a textual interface to the system. The system GMP, developed at Michigan State University [11] does support an interactive window, but there is no textual or language support. Further, their system does not handle directed graphs.

Reference-contexts: It is able to do this in parallel, however, which reduces the time from O (n 2 ) to O (n). These running times are well known in the literature <ref> [6] </ref>. * All-pairs Shortest Paths The function to do this is: m shortp ( graph ). This is similar to the transitive closure function and checks if the distance of a path is less than the current distance. If so, it would change the distance to the smaller distance.

We like to think of the GraphPack system in the same spirit as Macsyma, Mathematica, or Maple but specifically useful for graph operations.

Reference-contexts: For Mathematica, two special functions exist - cpoly and cnum, which find the chromatic polynomial and chromatic number of a graph, respectively. They are special because they are not true Mathematica functions. GraphPack loads Mathematica with a macro file which has functions taken from the Combina-torica <ref> [10] </ref>. Once loaded, the polynomial and number of a graph may be found. 7 Also, for SetPlayer the function mincov exists. This function calls SetPlayer iteratively until a set of vertices which cover the graph are found.
