Abstract: Computers have become an integral part of our everyday lives. Banks, airlines, motor vehicle administrations, police departments, Social Security, and the Internal Revenue Service all depend on computers. From their introduction, people have questioned the impact computers will have on society. We believe it is our responsibility as system designers to achieve organizational goals while serving human needs and protecting individual rights. The proposed Social Impact Statements (Shneiderman, 1990) would identify the impacts of information systems on direct and indirect users, who may be employees or the public. This paper proposes a framework for implementing Social Impact Statements for federal and local government agencies and regulated industries, with optional participation by the other privately held corporations. A Social Impact Statement should describe the new system and its benefits, acknowledge concerns and potential barriers, outline the development process, and address fundamental principles. Examples from our work with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice are offered.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we commit ourselves to studying ways to enable users to accomplish their personal and organizational goals while pursuing higher societal goals and serving human needs." The second part of the Declaration proposed writing a Social Impact Statement (SIS), similar to an Environmental Impact Statement <ref> (Battle, Fischman, & Squillace, 1994) </ref>. The goal is a high quality system whose design is discussed early and widely, thereby uncovering concerns and enabling stakeholders to openly state their positions. Such open discussions might improve quality which should lead to increased system acceptance.

Reference-contexts: Specific goals, like reduce the amount of paper used by ten percent, can be measured over time. More 1 0 subjective goals like, improve user satisfaction, can be evaluated by administering questionnaires. DJJ: The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) <ref> (Chin, Diehl, & Norman, 1988) </ref>, was administered to 332 employees to measure user satisfaction with ISYS. Using this as a benchmark, the QUIS could be readministered to measure the success of NISYS. 4. Address fundamental principles.

Reference-contexts: Centralization vs. decentralization is a long running debate about whether computer systems will result in decisions being made by a few select people (centralization) or by broader more diverse groups (decentralization) <ref> (George & King, 1991) </ref>. For example, a decentralized system gives more control to the end users, while a centralized system ensures consistent policies. However, with control also comes responsibility which needs to be delegated.
