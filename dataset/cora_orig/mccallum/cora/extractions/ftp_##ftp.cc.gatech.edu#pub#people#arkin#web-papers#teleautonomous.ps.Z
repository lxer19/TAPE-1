Abstract: Multiagent schema-based reactive robotic systems are complemented with the addition of a new behavior controlled by a human operator. This enables the whole society to be affected as a group rather than forcing the operator to control each agent individually. The operator is viewed by the reactive control system as another behavior exerting his/her influence on the society as a whole. The operator can also control the overall personality of the robot group. Simulation results are presented for foraging, vacuuming, and herding tasks. Results on real robots are presented for maneuvering robots out of a box canyon and squeezing robots through a small space. Teleautonomous operation of multiagent reactive systems was demonstrated to be significantly useful for some tasks, less so for others.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Reactive multiagent robotic societies are potentially useful for a wide-range of tasks. This includes operations such as foraging and grazing (e.g., <ref> [1, 12, 7] </ref>) which have applicability in service (vacuuming and cleaning), industrial (assembly) and military (convoy and scouting) scenarios. Although some promising results have been achieved in these systems to date [8], purely reactive systems can still benefit from human intervention. <p> In this research, the operator is allowed to control whole societies of agents; not one robot at a time, but rather controlling global behavior for the entire multiagent system. This is a straightforward extension of our work in both multiagent robotic systems <ref> [1] </ref> and teleautonomy [2]. The end product is a simple way for a commander to control large numbers of constituent elements without concern for low-level details (which each of the agents is capable of handling by themselves). <p> No arbitration is involved, rather a blending of all active concurrent behaviors occurs. The system at this level is completely reactive, not retaining knowledge of the world or the agent's past performance. 3 Multiagent Teleautonomous Control Our laboratory is conducting extensive research in multiagent robotic systems <ref> [1, 5, 4] </ref> both in simulation and on our 3 Denning Mobile Robots. Robotic systems are specified as a finite state acceptor that specifies the behavioral (schema) assemblages [9, 10] and the transitions between them. An example state machine for a foraging task appears in Figure 1. <p> The same behaviors are used as in the acquire state with the goal location now being the homebase. Space prevents a full discussion of the mechanisms for reactive multiagent control. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [1, 5] </ref> for more information. 3.1 Implementation We have developed a multiagent teleautonomy system called Telop.

Reference-contexts: In this research, the operator is allowed to control whole societies of agents; not one robot at a time, but rather controlling global behavior for the entire multiagent system. This is a straightforward extension of our work in both multiagent robotic systems [1] and teleautonomy <ref> [2] </ref>. The end product is a simple way for a commander to control large numbers of constituent elements without concern for low-level details (which each of the agents is capable of handling by themselves). <p> with global social strategies for task completion, and is far less involved with the specific behavioral tactics used by any individual agent. fl Portions of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB94) 2 Single agent teleautonomous control Our previous results <ref> [2] </ref> in the integration of reactive and telerobotic control in the context of single agents provide the basis for our extension of this concept into multiagent societies.

Reference-contexts: Using a schema-based methodology <ref> [3] </ref>, each active behavior contributes a vector that is related to the agent's intentions such as to get to a particular object, not crash into something, etc. <p> For example, the robot can become more aggressive by increasing its attraction towards a desirable object or decreasing its repulsion from obstacles. In schema-based reactive control <ref> [3] </ref>, each active behavior (schema) provides its own reaction to the environment by creating a vector response to a specific perceptual stimulus. The entire set of vector outputs created by all active schemas is summed and normalized and then transmitted to the robot for execution. <p> A small amount of noise is still injected into the system to facilitate navigation <ref> [3] </ref>. * Deliver which occurs after acquisition of the attractor and results in delivery of the object back to homebase by one or more agents. The same behaviors are used as in the acquire state with the goal location now being the homebase. <p> For instance, one parameter of the avoid-static-obstacle behavior is the gain. Increasing this value linearly increases the magnitude of the vector output by this behavior. This has the effect of causing the robot to exhibit a stronger aversion to obstacles. For more information about the behavioral parameters, see <ref> [3] </ref>. The human operator can also manipulate the behavioral parameters in terms of abstract personality traits. Making parameter changes in terms of personality traits allows a user, with no knowledge about the underlying behaviors and their parameters, to effectively modify the robots' behavior.

A robot is capable of communicating its current behavioral state or the location of an attractor that it is acquiring or delivering <ref> [5] </ref>. The communication is simulated by using shared memory. Each agent only looks at this shared memory when there is no attractor within its sensing range.

Although some promising results have been achieved in these systems to date <ref> [8] </ref>, purely reactive systems can still benefit from human intervention. Many purely reactive systems are myopic in their approach: they sacrifice global knowledge for rapid local interaction. Global information can be useful and it is in this capacity that a human operator can interact with a multiagent control system.
