Title: Intelligent Information Gathering Using Decision Models  
Author: Shlomo Zilberstein and Victor Lesser

Affiliation: Computer Science Department University of Massachusetts at  
Abstract: This paper describes an architecture for the next generation of information gathering systems. The paper is based on a research proposal whose goal is to exploit the vast amount of information sources available today on the NII including a growing number of digital libraries, independent news agencies, government agencies, as well as human experts providing a variety of services. The large number of information sources and their different levels of accessibility, reliability and associated costs present a complex information gathering coordination problem. We outline the structure and components of an information gathering system that uses an explicit representation of the user's decision model in order to organize its activity. Within this framework, information gathering planning is performed based on its marginal contribution to the user's decision quality.

Reference-contexts: A rapid expansion of these services is expected over the next 5-10 years. In addition, we anticipate that improved information retrieval (IR) and information extraction (IE) technologies will become available <ref> [2, 24] </ref>. These technologies will allow a system not only to locate but also to extract necessary information from unstructured textual documents. <p> Some successful techniques for information retrieval and information extraction have been developed at the University of Massachusetts National Center for In telligent Information Retrieval <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 The User Interface Although the user interface (UI) does not represent the focus of this paper, it is an important component that will allow for high level interaction between the user and the DME and IG subsystems.

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished by not putting any restrictions on the information gathering activities other than that they can be mapped (described at an abstract level) into a domain-independent framework that we have developed called TAEMS <ref> [3] </ref>. This mapping has to have sufficient detail so that alternative ways of executing the activities for a specific decision node which trade off cost/quality/duration are appropriately represented.

Reference-contexts: In the current design of the system, parallel information gathering activity is initiated and coordinated by a single site. Another possible model that we (and others) have studied involves a distributed search process conducted by multiple sites <ref> [4, 20, 21, 22] </ref>. To allow for this type of operation, only the IG subsystem would have to be modified. While information requests are being processed, the system should be able to respond asynchronously to various events such as arrival of data and changes in the user's decision model. 3.

Reference-contexts: Planning Information Gathering Actions In order to automate the information gathering process, we will construct information gathering plans, similar to the softbot-based interface to the internet proposed by Etzioni and Weld <ref> [5] </ref>. Our planning approach is based on extending current information-theoretic techniques to derive plans that are most valuable to the user based on the decision model. This approach addresses explicitly the problem of uncertainty regarding the quality, completeness, cost and delay associated with each source of informa tion. 4.

Reference-contexts: With the rapid growth in information services, the issue of quality of information versus resource allocation is equally relevant in making simple decisions. 4.2 The Value of Information Gathering This section describes a method for calculating the value of information gathering (VOIG). Information value theory <ref> [13] </ref> provides a mathematical foundation to guide this central decision. Previous work in this field has concentrated on the value of perfect information. In our problem domain, however, the available information may be inaccurate or incomplete.

This extension is described below using the notation of Russell and Wefald <ref> [25] </ref>. Suppose that the current information available to the agent is K. K corresponds to the current belief regarding the value of different random variables included in the decision model. Let O i be the possible outcomes of the user's decision. <p> In related work, Russell and Wefald <ref> [25] </ref> distinguish between three generic cases for the value of perfect information.
