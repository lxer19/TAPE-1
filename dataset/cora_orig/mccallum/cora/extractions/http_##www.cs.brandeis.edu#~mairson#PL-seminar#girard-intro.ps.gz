Abstract: This is perfect in mathematics, but wrong in real life, since real implication is causal. A causal implication cannot be iterated since the conditions are modified after its use ; this process of modification of the premises (conditions) is known in physics as reaction. For instance, if A is to spend $1 on a pack of cigarettes and B is to get them, you lose $1 in this process, and you cannot do it a second time. The reaction here was that $1 went out of your pocket. The first objection to that view is that there are in mathematics, in real life, cases where reaction does not exist or can be neglected : think of a lemma which is forever true, or of a Mr. Soros, who has almost an infinite amount of dollars. Such cases are situations in the sense of stable truths. Our logical refinements should not prevent us to cope with situations, and there will be a specific kind

Reference-contexts: Anyway, whatever is the ultimate status of games w.r.t. logic, this is an essential intuition : typically game semantics of linear logic is the main ingredient in the recent solution of the problem of full abstraction for the language PCF, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.4.3 The completeness problem The main theoretical problem at stake is to find a complete semantics for (first order) linear logic. Up to now, the only completeness is achieved at the level of provability (by phase spaces) which is rather marginal.

Reference-contexts: can try to plug a single loudspeaker to the two outputs plugs simultaneously ; maybe it works, maybe it explodes, but anyway the behaviour of such an experimental plugging is not covered by the guarantee : : : 2.4 Game semantics Recently Blass introduced a semantics of linear logic, see <ref> [5] </ref>, this volume. The semantics is far from being complete (i.e. it accepts additional principles), but this direction is promising. Let us forget the state of the art and let us focus on what could be the general pattern of a convincing game semantics. 2.4.1 Plays, strategies etc.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between the two conjunctions can be explained by the possible ways of merging dialects : this is a new insight in the theory of parallel computation. Geometry of interaction also works for various -calculi, for instance for pure -calculus, see <ref> [7, 26] </ref>. It has also been applied to the problem of optimal reduction in -calculus, see [20]. Let us end this chapter by yet another refutation of weakening and contraction : 1.

Reference-contexts: introduction of conjunction is problematic : from cliques in respectively ?X and ?Y , when both X and Y are positive, there are two ways to get a clique in ?(X Y ). This is why one must replace LK with another calculus LC, see <ref> [13] </ref> for more details, in which a specific positive formula may be distinguished. LC has a denotational semantics, but the translation from LK to LC is far from being deterministic.

Reference-contexts: The miracle is that this combination of classical with intuitionistic features accommodates intuitionistic logic for free, and this eventually leads to the system LU of unified logic, see <ref> [14] </ref>. 2.3 Geometry of interaction At some moment we indicated an electronic analogy ; in fact the analogy was good enough to explain step (1) of cut-elimination (see subsection 1.3.6 by the fact that an extension cord has no action (except perhaps a short delay, which corresponds to the cut-elimination step).

Reference-contexts: Termination of the process is interpreted as the nilpotency of u, and the part u (1 u) 1 is a candidate for the execution. See <ref> [15] </ref>, this volume, for more details. One of the main novelties of this paper is the use of dialects, i.e. data which are defined up to isomorphism.
