Abstract: The Red Rover algorithm previously presented for deadlock-free routing in rings is applied to bidirectional k-ary n-cube multicomputer networks in this work. This algorithm provides greater throughput and lower message latencies than alternative algorithms in most cases. The increased performance offered by this algorithm for wormhole-routed networks is quantified through simulation experiments. Additionally, a routing element which implements this algorithm is shown to be simpler and faster than those of other algorithms by using a well-known timing model.

Reference-contexts: The Red Rover also outperforms the other two algorithms when using 64-flit packets, as shown in Figure 4. In this case the advantages are slightly reduced, as the maximum performance gains are on the order of 25%. In <ref> [1] </ref> it is noted that as the network gets closer to the saturation point, there is a perceptible difference in the efficiencies of nodes at different locations because of asymmetric loads on the virtual channels imposed by Dally's spiral algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Our model allows the routing of a single header in a time of T head . The extra complexity of a parallel router, which arbitrates among multiple headers simultaneously, has been shown to give little or no advantage in terms of performance in the presence of wormhole flow control <ref> [2] </ref>. When a trailing flit, or non-header, reaches the top of an input lane, it merely follows the path previously set up by the header. A trail ing flit can be forwarded from an input channel to an output channel in a time of T trail .

Reference-contexts: As each routing algorithm presented in this paper differs in complexity, it is obvious that router delay will also differ for each algorithm. In this section, we compute delay times for the various router subcomponents by applying the delay model developed in <ref> [3] </ref>, which assumes 0.8m CMOS gate array technology. These times are then used in Section 4.4 to scale the results accordingly. All node components are assumed to be synchronized by a clock signal. <p> Results would be different for asynchronous routers. As described in <ref> [3] </ref>, the router model is subdivided into dimensions. Also, the head flit of a message traverses a path through the router that is somewhat different from the path traversed by trailing flits. However, all flits of a message traverse the same external physical path. <p> As shown in the table, the Red Rover algorithm has the shortest cycle time. Furthermore, the VLSI area required to implement the Red Rover algorithm is less, since implementation size is proportional to F , P , and V <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.3 Traffic Patterns In our model each node generates packets independently according to an exponential distribution, and the destinations are chosen according to the following traffic patterns, which occur in many numerical computations [9].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wormhole routing [10] is a pipelined, circuit-switching mechanism that is being used in several multicomputers such as the Intel Ter-aFLOPS machine [6], the IBM SP1/2 systems <ref> [4] </ref>, and the Cray T3D/E systems [12]. It is particularly popular because it has a simple hardware implementation that can provide low-latency communication. Unfortunately, wormhole routing has the blocking property characteristic of circuit-switched networks.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, its performance degrades rapidly as the message traffic increases beyond some level as a high percentage of the messages get blocked before they can reach their desti nation. The other drawback of a blocking technique is the possibility of deadlock if the routing algorithm is not appropriately constrained <ref> [5] </ref>. Another important factor in multicomputer network performance is the network topology. Torus connections are often favored over mesh-connected (no wraparounds) networks primarily because the diameter of a ring is half that of a linear strip, which contains no wraparound connections. <p> Deadlock cycles may occur within or across dimensions in a k-ary n-cube torus. All routing algorithms presented in this paper use dimension ordering to prevent interdimension cycles; they differ only in how they prevent deadlock cycles within a dimension. An algorithm developed by Dally and Seitz <ref> [5] </ref> uses virtual channels to transform intradimension cycles into spirals. In this scheme, all channels in a unidimensional cycle are broken up into pairs of virtual channels (refer to Figure 1). A virtual channel pair is implemented by time-multiplexing onto the associated physical channel. <p> A similar observation is made for positive-going messages. It is this characteristic which transforms the cycles into spirals and thus makes the algorithm sufficient for deadlock-free routing. In [8], Duato proposes an adaptive alternative to Dally's spiral algorithm. Rather than using the static channel dependency graph presented in <ref> [5] </ref>, Duato's scheme only requires the absence of cyclic dependencies on a connected channel subset. The resulting algorithm allows any message to traverse A virtual channels. <p> More details of this algorithm including a proof that it is free from deadlock are given in [8]. 3 The Red Rover Routing Al gorithm As shown in <ref> [5] </ref>, some ordering of resources is necessary to provide deadlock prevention in routing on networks with wraparound connec tions. For unidirectional tori, imposing an or-dering via the utilization of virtual channels to effectively transform rings into spirals is as plausible a solution as any.

Reference-contexts: Given the recent popularity of torus structures, most notably in the Cray T3D and T3E, it is important that an efficient routing algorithm be used, especially if coupled with wormhole routing. The Red Rover algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> was previously presented as an efficient algorithm for bidirectional rings. In this paper, we show how the Red Rover algorithm can be used for increased performance in k-ary n-cubes. The work of [7] is further extended by simulating the algorithm for several different traffic patterns. <p> The Red Rover algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> was previously presented as an efficient algorithm for bidirectional rings. In this paper, we show how the Red Rover algorithm can be used for increased performance in k-ary n-cubes. The work of [7] is further extended by simulating the algorithm for several different traffic patterns. An exact implementation assessment based on a well-known cost model is also developed, yielding more accurate simulation results. <p> For unidirectional tori, imposing an or-dering via the utilization of virtual channels to effectively transform rings into spirals is as plausible a solution as any. However, for bidirectional tori, an alternative ordering of the virtual channels is possible, as given in the Red Rover algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. The Red Rover Algorithm is extremely simple. <p> Similarly, messages injected on B channels are confined to B channels for their entire traversals. This specification stipulates routing within a dimension and applies to routing with k-ary n-cube tori when coupled with a dimension ordering. A proof that it is free from deadlock is given in <ref> [7] </ref>. 4 Simulation Experiments This section first presents a router model along with an implementation analysis to accurately evaluate each algorithm. Various traffic patterns used in the simulation experiments are then described, and results are presented for several scenarios on a 16-ary 2-cube.

Reference-contexts: At this point, the message switches to B virtual channels to complete its route. A similar observation is made for positive-going messages. It is this characteristic which transforms the cycles into spirals and thus makes the algorithm sufficient for deadlock-free routing. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Duato proposes an adaptive alternative to Dally's spiral algorithm. Rather than using the static channel dependency graph presented in [5], Duato's scheme only requires the absence of cyclic dependencies on a connected channel subset. The resulting algorithm allows any message to traverse A virtual channels. <p> However, only positive-going messages at a node numbered less than the destination or negative-going messages at a node numbered greater than the destination are allowed to use the B virtual channels. More details of this algorithm including a proof that it is free from deadlock are given in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 The Red Rover Routing Al gorithm As shown in [5], some ordering of resources is necessary to provide deadlock prevention in routing on networks with wraparound connec tions. <p> Specific points of interest are 3-dimensional networks, as there are currently several research and commercial systems which employ a 3-dimensional network. Also, we will evaluate a class of adaptive routing algorithms <ref> [8] </ref> achieved by adding more virtual channels and using Red Rover as the base routing algorithm. Such algorithms also provide a measure of fault tolerance. munication patterns: 8-flit packets munication patterns: 64-flit packets torus is represented as a flattened grid.
