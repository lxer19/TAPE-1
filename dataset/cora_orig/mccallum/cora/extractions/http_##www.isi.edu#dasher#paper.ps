Reference-contexts: In particular, they system should facilitate needs to integrate relevant parts of an EC procurement system with existing company business practices, legacy systems, and commercial production and inventory control software <ref> [ 29, 30] </ref>. For instance, the procurement broker may need to support collective quantity discounts that the buyer has previously negotiated with several sellers. While each such special issue can be handled by human operators, the long term need is for increased levels of automation.

Reference-contexts: Both FAST and DASHER communicate with Appscan by email, although this interface is inconsistent with the new architecture. When Appscan was written, no commercial equivalent was available; today there are some similar programs (e.g., <ref> [ 34] </ref>). Using a script for the specific online service, Appscan logs into the online system, navigates through its forms, and enters the request using the data in its message.

Reference-contexts: There are roughly 2900 lines of SQL code and 10,000 lines of other code. The CORBA/PowerBuilder interface between Sourcing and Quoting has about 6300 lines of code, not counting the PowerBuilder portion. The Appscan module consists of about 5800 lines of Icon <ref> [ 35] </ref> code. The X12 tran s-lator has about 22,000 lines of code, including the CORBA interface, and uses about 30 relational tables. 4.3. Design of Quoting The Quoting service obtains price and availability for parts. The core input to Quoting is a part descri p-tion, just as in Sourcing.

Reference-contexts: Legacy code can be integrated into CORBA applications by modeling their interface in the IDL, and using the API code to wrapper the existing applications. At the time of this writing, at least seven products implement some or all of the CORBA standard <ref> [ 38] </ref>. Of them, we currently use PostModern Computings Orbeline. An alternative approach to CORBA is Microsoft's OLE [39]. In the C++ version of Orbeline, much of the code that implements the server API is automatically generated from the IDL.

Reference-contexts: This work is in progress, and involves no new technology issues. The platform independence is a direct result of the use of an interconnection techno l-ogy that is designed for it, and the modular design of the services. 5.2.1.

Reference-contexts: Because the CORBA inter-module architecture is object-based, the database insertion must map the objects into relational tables. We chose PowerModel <ref> [ 42] </ref> for the conversion tool because it also provides useful deve l-opment and rapid-prototyping capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the quotes are returned by the same flowpath as the original request, back in Figure 6. To eliminate the need for the Web browser to busy-poll the Web server about the status of a request, we are investigating the use of Java <ref> [ 43] </ref>, developed by Sun Microsystems. Java introduces the ability to transfer executable programs (using interpreted code) from the server to the client. A Java program thread that is waiting for input from the server allows the server to push data to the client.

Reference-contexts: Difficulties involve compatibility, mai n-tainability, portability, robustness, reliability, system management, lack of metalevel control, and troubl e-shooting, across modules, versions, and platforms. There are subtle inconsistent dependencies, it is impossible to trace execution, and there is no single expert. The term MegaProgramming <ref> [ 44] </ref> refers to 17 this situation. The long-term goal that motivates our work is to develop the technology of federated systems that offer the promise of building large systems, composed of large numbers of loosely affiliated, easily interco n-nected, independently developed software components.

Reference-contexts: The concept is that an agent program crawls the Web, autonomously looking for services that satisfy known users needs. For simple needs (e.g., news articles about the President), such agent-based systems will commonly available within a few years. Already some agents-based systems are starting to be offered commercially <ref> [ 45] </ref>, although the word agent is simply a buzzword to promote conventional sof t-ware. In the domain of EC, one can foresee agent-based systems informing users about new distributors, new brokers, new financial services, etc.
