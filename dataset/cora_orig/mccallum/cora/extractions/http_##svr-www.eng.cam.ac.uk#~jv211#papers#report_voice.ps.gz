Reference-contexts: Similar combined models have been applied to the enhancement of speech corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (Goh et al., 1998), and to the modelling of general time series <ref> (Barnett et al., 1996) </ref>. 3 Parameter estimation for the combined model is particularly difficult, since it requires estimates of the uncorrupted speech and glottal excitation signals to be available.

Reference-contexts: If nothing is known a priori about x 0 , then x 0 = 0 and x 0 is the autocovariance matrix for p + qt s samples drawn from an AR (p + qt s ) process with coefficients c p and excitation variance 2 e <ref> (Box et al., 1994) </ref>. In this case x 0 depends on b, 2 e , t s , p and a p , which will complicate the computation of the full posterior conditionals for b and a p .

Reference-contexts: depends on the parameters of the pitch and vocal tract models, sampling may proceed by proposing candidates from the correspond ing conditional distribution with the term N (x 0 ; x 0 ; x 0 ) removed, and then either accepting or rejecting these candidates in a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance step <ref> (Chib and Greenberg, 1994) </ref>. This will hardly ever be necessary, since the contribution of N (x 0 ; x 0 ; x 0 ) to the probability mass will be small if T p + qt s .

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that rejection sampling is employed in sampling from the conditional for the S-AR coefficients in (35), in that samples that lead to unstable filters (i.e. having poles outside the unit circle) are discarded (see <ref> (Godsill, 1997a) </ref> for a similar approach). If the likelihood function of the initial samples N (x 0 ; x 0 ; x 0 ) is independent of the parameters of the pitch and vocal tract models, this term would disappear from (35) to (37), greatly simplifying the sampling procedure.

Reference-contexts: This model is combined with a standard autoregressive vocal tract model to form an improved speech production model for voiced sounds. Similar combined models have been applied to the enhancement of speech corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise <ref> (Goh et al., 1998) </ref>, and to the modelling of general time series (Barnett et al., 1996). 3 Parameter estimation for the combined model is particularly difficult, since it requires estimates of the uncorrupted speech and glottal excitation signals to be available. <p> Most traditional methods approach these problems by assuming that the noise variance can be measured from speech-free segments of the observed signal, and various ad hoc estimation strategies for the model parameters (see, for example, <ref> (Goh et al., 1998) </ref>). Here a fully Bayesian framework is presented to solve elegantly the signal reconstruction, inverse filtering and parameter estimation problems simultaneously. The inferences required from the resulting posterior distribution are analytically intractable, and are hence approximated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.

Reference-contexts: It is intuitively obvious that the optimal modelling order is dependent on the class of speech under consideration, and should, for the best performance, be estimated from the observed data alongside the other parameters. Here a model selection scheme based on the reversible jump MCMC sampler <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref> is adopted, since it can be seamlessly integrated into the overall MCMC estimation framework. The speech production model and estimation strategy presented here can potentially be applied to a wide range of speech processing problems. <p> Since points in C may vary in dimensionality, sampling from (40) cannot be performed by a standard Gibbs sampling step. Instead, a variable dimension scheme based on the reversible jump MCMC method <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref> is employed here. This scheme works by considering (p; a p ) as the current state in a Markov chain that has (40) as its invariant distribution.
