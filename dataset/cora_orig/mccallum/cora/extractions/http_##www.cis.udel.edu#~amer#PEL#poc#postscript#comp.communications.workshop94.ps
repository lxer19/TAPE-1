Title: Partial Order Transport Service: An Analytic Model

Abstract: Traditional transport service is either (1) reliable and ordered (e.g., TCP) or (2) unreliable and unordered (e.g., UDP). Some new computer applications such as multimedia do not fit perfectly with either of these services. Partial Order Connection (POC), a new transport-layer protocol, tries to fill the gap between (1) and (2). With POC, an application specifies a partial order (P O) for valid orderings of the packets. Packets can be transmitted or delivered by respecting any linear extension (LE) of the given P O. POC provides more generality than traditional transport protocols, which allow a user to specify the order only as a chain or an anti-chain. In POC, the reliability requirements are similarly generalized: rather than a complete guarantee as with TCP, or no guarantee as with UDP, in POC, a user specifies controlled levels of loss. Hence, POC provides partial-order and partial-reliability service. This paper presents an analytic model for POC. Results show that POC provides performance improvements over existing transport services when network service is lossy, the ratio of transmission time to propagation delay is large, or when the P O has few precedence constraints.

Reference-contexts: Since P O may be any partial order of size N , and R may assume 2 N different values when defined over f0; 1g, the number of different potential service profiles for a given N is large (although finite). 1.1 Example Applications Reference <ref> [1] </ref> reviews the development and motivation for a partial order protocol/service including several examples. The material is briefly summarized here. Essentially, a partial-order service can be employed and is motivated whenever a total order on the delivery of objects is not mandatory.

Reference-contexts: A partial-order, partial-reliability transport protocol is a transport protocol that allows the user to provide a partial order P O and reliability vector R to specify the precise level of service required. Partial Order Connection (POC) is an example of such a protocol <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Except when needed for emphasis, we usually drop the adjective partial-reliability and assume that a partial-order service (connection, protocol) also provides partial-reliability unless otherwise specified.

Reference-contexts: The hP O; LEi that makes the expected buffering time for packet a minimal also minimizes the expected end-to-end packet delay for a. 3 The density of a partial order is a measurement defined as follows <ref> [6] </ref>. Let D represent the cardinality of the set of all ordered pairs (a; b) such that a b in PO. The maximum value for D is n (n 1)=2, therefore the density, d, is defined by the ratio d = 2D=[n (n 1)].
