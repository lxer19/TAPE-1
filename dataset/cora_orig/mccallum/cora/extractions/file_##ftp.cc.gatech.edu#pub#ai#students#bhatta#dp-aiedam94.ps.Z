Abstract: One method for making analogies is to access and instantiate abstract domain principles, and one method for acquiring knowledge of abstract principles is to discover them from experience. We view generalization over experiences in the absence of any prior knowledge of the target principle as the task of hypothesis formation, a subtask of discovery. Also, we view the use of the hypothesized principles for analogical design as the task of hypothesis testing, another subtask of discovery. In this paper, we focus on discovery of physical principles by generalization over design experiences in the domain of physical devices. Some important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. We represent a reasoner's comprehension of specific designs in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. An SBF model provides a functional and causal explanation of the working of a device. We represent domain principles as device-independent behavior-function (BF) models. We show that (i) the function of a device determines what to generalize from its SBF model, (ii) the SBF model itself suggests how far to generalize, and (iii) the typology of functions indicates what method to use.

Reference-contexts: IDeAL uses repair plans for modifying a selected design. It verifies the new design by a qualitative simulation of the new SBF model. Finally, the new design case generated by IDeAL acts as input to its learning component. IDeAL first learns indices to the new design case <ref> [Bhatta and Goel, 1992] </ref> and stores the design for potential reuse. While storing design cases it notices similarities between the SBF models of specific designs in memory and discovers principles as described later in this article. <p> Storing the hypothesized models in a hierarchically organized memory implies two distinct issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization <ref> [Bhatta and Goel, 1992] </ref>. Deciding on the indexing vocabulary generally requires some notion of what is important about the new knowledge and the task for which it is likely to be reused. <p> in memory and the inductive biases that can be generated at storage time. 14 We have earlier shown how the SBF model of a design, together with a specification of the task for which the design case might be reused, provides the vocabulary for indexing the design case in memory <ref> [Bhatta and Goel, 1992] </ref> . Further, we have also shown how the model-based method, together with similarity-based learning (using earlier design cases in memory) helps to determine the level of index generalization. <p> Insofar as the same types of indices are used for storing the models of heat exchangers and the models of the zeroth law of thermodynamics, the same methods as presented in <ref> [Bhatta and Goel, 1992] </ref> apply to the task of learning indices to the hypothesized models. The only difference is that the indices for these models will be more general than those for design cases. <p> However, from our experience with other tasks for which SBF models have been used, such as case-based design [Goel, 1989; Goel, 1991a; Goel, 1991b] and index learning by model-based generalization <ref> [Bhatta and Goel, 1992; Bhatta and Goel, 1993] </ref>, in different domains, it 15 appears that the proposed method is also applicable in other domains of physical devices such as electric circuits (i.e., for instance, in learning Ohm's law).

Reference-contexts: Transfer in this scheme involves accessing the abstractions associated with a source analog and then instantiating them in the target domain rather than directly mapping source-specific substructures onto the target problem. We call this method model-based analogy. (See <ref> [Bhatta, 1992] </ref> for 17 details). The models of physical principles and processes are more abstract than the models of prototypical devices.

Reference-contexts: The learned principles are intended to be evaluated and revised by their use in cross-domain analogical design. 3 Device Models IDeAL's functional models of specific devices are represented in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. These models are based on a component-substance ontology <ref> [Bylander and Chandrasekaran, 1985] </ref>. This ontology gives rise to a representation language [Goel, 1992] for describing the SBF model of a design that is a generalization on Sembug-amoorthy and Chandrasekaran's [1986] functional representation scheme. The constituents of the SBF model are described below.

Reference-contexts: This is unlike most explanation-based learning systems <ref> [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell et al., 1986] </ref> that assume some knowledge of the target concept that needs to be learned. The process of discovery is generally considered to have two distinct phases [Klahr and Dunbar, 1988]: hypothesis formation and hypothesis testing. <p> Our approach is similar to Winston's later models [1982; 1986] that show that learning can be done by analogically transferring causal links in the explanation of an example to the target concept. Our approach is also similar to explanation-based learning (EBL) <ref> [DeJong and Mooney, 1986; Mitchell et al., 1986] </ref> in using explanations (SBF models) to constrain the learning of "concepts." However, most EBL systems assume some knowledge of the target concept a priori; our model-based approach attempts to discover them.

Reference-contexts: In this respect, our work is similar to Pazzani's OCCAM [1991] which integrates similarity-based learning, EBL, and theory-driven learning (TDL) for learning of concepts. Learning by Discovery: Our approach can be compared to work in scientific discovery such as BACON [Langley et al., 1987], FAHRENHEIT [Zytkow, 1987], and ABACUS <ref> [Falkenhainer and Michalski, 1986] </ref>. These systems require a large amount of data because they use inductive approaches to discover regularities and form laws. In contrast, IDeAL is designed to incrementally discover physical principles using models to guide the discovery process.

Reference-contexts: This law states that when a hot body is brought in thermal contact with a cold body, heat flows from the hot body to the cold body <ref> [Fermi, 1937] </ref>. We show how the BF models of physical principles can be acquired by a gradual removal of structural information from the SBF models of specific devices. This process of generalization occurs while storing a design case for potential reuse.

Reference-contexts: IDeAL applies both methods, when applicable, in a specific order, that is, it generalizes over parameter changes prior to changes in location. Models at intermediate levels of abstraction are models of prototypical devices (similar to design prototypes <ref> [Gero, 1990] </ref>) such as the model of a heat exchanger that is applicable to both coolers and heaters.

Reference-contexts: For example, in our earlier work on case-based design, we showed how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models of physical devices can be used for directly mapping the designs of those devices to new problems <ref> [Goel, 1991a] </ref>. An SBF model of a device captures the reasoner's comprehension of how the device works, that is, how the structure of its design results in its output behaviors. <p> The design cases are organized 2 IDeAL stands for Integrated "DEsign by Analogy and Learning." 4 along multiple dimensions of generalization where the dimensions pertain to the constituents of design functions. The problem-solving component of IDeAL evolves from Kritik, an integrated case-based and model-based design system <ref> [Goel, 1991a; Goel, 1992] </ref>. Given the functional specification of a desired design, IDeAL retrieves the closest matching case from the case memory. Then it uses the SBF model of the selected design to adapt the design structure so as to meet the given functional specification. <p> However, from our experience with other tasks for which SBF models have been used, such as case-based design <ref> [Goel, 1989; Goel, 1991a; Goel, 1991b] </ref> and index learning by model-based generalization [Bhatta and Goel, 1992; Bhatta and Goel, 1993], in different domains, it 15 appears that the proposed method is also applicable in other domains of physical devices such as electric circuits (i.e., for instance, in learning Ohm's law).

(ii) Analogical Design: The hypothesized abstract models, that is, the models of the heat exchanger and the zeroth law of thermodynamics, can also be tested by using them for design by analogy.
