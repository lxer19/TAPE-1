Abstract: The University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) is an open system that allows third-parties to build and integrate their own profitseeking agents into the marketplace of information goods and services. The profitseeking behavior of agents, however, risks inefficient allocation of goods and services, as agents take strategic stances that might backfire. While it would be good if we could impose mechanisms to remove incentives for strategic reasoning, such mechanisms are not possible in the UMDL. Therefore, our approach has instead been to study whether encouraging the other extrememaking strategic reasoning ubiquitousprovides an answer. Toward this end, we have designed a strategy (called p-strategy) that uses a stochastic model of the market to find the best offer price. We have then examined the collective behavior of p-strategy agents in the UMDL auction. Our experiments show that strategic thinking is not always beneficial and that the advantage of being strategic decreases with the arrival of equally strategic agents. Furthermore, a simple strategy can be as effective when enough other agents use the p-strategy. Consequently, we expect the UMDL is likely to evolve to a point where some agents use simpler strategies and some use the p-strategy. Because of that, although the market efficiency (measured by total profit) decreases with an increasing number of p-strategy agents, the UMDL will not suffer inefficiency in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: The example of such dynamic systems that we use throughout this paper is the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL). In the UMDL project, we aim to provide an infrastructure for rendering library services in a networked information environment <ref> (Durfee et al., 1998) </ref>. We have designed the UMDL as a multiagent system, where agents (representing users, collections, and services of the digital library) sell and buy information goods and services through auctions. <p> Due to space limitations, we ignore the issues of how to describe what agents buy or sell, how to locate the right auction to participate in, when and how to create an auction, and so on. Interested readers may refer to <ref> (Durfee et al., 1998) </ref>. At present, the UMDL uses the AuctionBot software (Mullen & Wellman, 1996) parameterized for double Sellers Buyers QPA-1 QPA-n UIA-2 Auction Auction for sell-offers buy-offers . . . auctions where agents post both sell prices and buy prices.

Reference-contexts: However, designing a good mechanism that exhibits certain propertieswhich is called incentive engineering or mechanism design <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994) </ref>is difficult, especially for dynamic systems where the participants and their interactions evolve over time. The example of such dynamic systems that we use throughout this paper is the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL). <p> For instance, Rosenschein and Zlotkin have identified two building blocks of a multiagent system, protocol and strategy (which are mechanism and individual agent in our terminology, respectively), and focused on designing a protocol which ...motivates agents towards telling the truth... <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994) </ref>. Unfortunately, game theory tends to be applied to highly abstract and simplified settings. We do not use game theory because the UMDL is too complex to model and because we cannot assume rationality in agents.

Reference-contexts: The p-strategy We have developed an agent strategy (called p-strategy) that finds the best offer price for the multiagent auction <ref> (Park, Durfee & Birmingham, 1996) </ref>. The fourstep p-strategy is as follows. First, the agent models the auction process using a Markov chain (MC) with two absorbing states (success and failure). <p> In this paper, we skip how to define the exact transition probabilities between the MC states (step 2), how to compute the probabilities and the payoffs of success and failure (step 3), and how to find the best payment (step 4). Readers may refer to <ref> (Park, Durfee & Birmingham, 1996) </ref>. Using the MC model and its transition probabilities, the p-strategy agent is able to capture various factors that influence the utility value and tradeoffs associated with the factors. Figure 5 shows an example of tradeoffs between the number of buyers and sellers. <p> which models the auction process stochastically receives higher profit than the other strategies. 0 200 0 400 0 600 0 QPA QPA 1 0 00 3 0 00 5 0 00 ZI p - 0 2 00 0 4 00 0 6 00 0 QPA QPA In our previous paper <ref> (Park, Durfee, and Birmingham, 1996) </ref>, we have shown the advantages of the p-strategy in the domain of multiagent contracts with possible retraction.

For limitations of Vickery auctions, see the work by Sandholm <ref> (Sandholm, 1996) </ref>. mechanism that prevents strategic thinking (which is hard), we use a bottom-up approach: we design a strategy that the UMDL agents may use and experiment with such strategic agents to learn about the system properties.

Reference-contexts: Of course, these two design issues are interdependent; a well-designed mechanism can simplify the design of individual agents (and vice versa). For instance, Vickery's auction mechanism <ref> (Vickery, 1961) </ref> makes rational agents bid their true reservation prices such that even self-interested agents, if they are rational, will behave honestly (and not try in vain to outsmart other agents) 1 .
