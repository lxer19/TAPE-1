Abstract: we consider the problem of computing the minimum area m-envelope for P whose counter clockwise sequence of exterior angles is given by A. We show that such envelopes can be computed in O(nm log m) time.

Reference-contexts: The problem of computing min-imum convex polygonal enclosures of m sides for an n-sided convex polygon (without angle constraints) was considered originally by Boyce, Dobkin, Drysdale, and Guibas [2] and later by Aggarwal and Park <ref> [1] </ref>, who showed that the problem can be solved in O (nm) time. It is often of practical value to impose additional shape constraints on the enclosure, for example, the constraint that a four-sided enclosure be a rectangle, or that a three-sided enclosure be an equilateral triangle. <p> When the algorithm is completed, then the smallest polygon found so far is reported. We summarize the algorithm below. It is given the polygon P and the sequence ff of exterior angles. procedure MinEnv (P , ff) f n = sizeof (P ); m = sizeof (ff); fi <ref> [1] </ref> = 0:0; =fl compute angle offsets fl= for i = 2 to m do for i = 1 to m do f =fl initial contact points fl= C [i] = Contact point of P with line at angle fi [i]; Add critical angle for side i into priority queue; g

Reference-contexts: angles we select the smallest to be the next critical angle. (In general there may be ties for the next critical angle, but it will simplify the presentation to assume that they are distinct.) By storing these angles and the associated contact points and envelope sides in a priority queue <ref> [4] </ref> we can extract the minimum angle in O (log m) time.

Reference-contexts: Flushness is a common finiteness condition used to restrict the otherwise infinite search performed in many geometric optimization algorithms. For many existing rotating calipers solutions, establishing flushness is a relatively easy matter (but there are exceptions <ref> [5] </ref>). However, for this problem the proof of the flushness condition is much subtler because any rotation of a single side of the m-envelope affects all m sides (because of the angle constraints).

Reference-contexts: Once the contact points are known, it is an easy matter to compute the area of the resulting envelope in O (m) time. (We assume a real-RAM model of computation in which arithmetic operations, comparisons, square roots, and trigonometric functions can be performed in constant time <ref> [15] </ref>.) The algorithm operates in stages, each one advancing from one critical angle to the next. To determine the next critical event, for each edge of the envelope we compute the next angle at which it becomes flush with the edge of P lying just counterclockwise of the contact point.

Reference-contexts: Our main result is an O (nm log m) time and O (n + m) space algorithm for this problem. This is O (n) time and space if m is a constant.
