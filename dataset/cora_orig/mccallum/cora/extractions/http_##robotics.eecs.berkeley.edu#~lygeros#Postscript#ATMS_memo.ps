Abstract: In a new collaborative project involving the University of California, Berkeley, NASA Ames Research Center, and Honeywell Systems Research Center, we have begun the study of hierarchical, hybrid control systems in the framework of air traffic management systems (ATMS). The need for a new ATMS arises from the overcrowding of large urban airports and the need to more efficiently land and take off larger numbers of aircraft, without building new runways. Technological advances that make a more advanced air traffic control system a reality include the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time computers both on board the aircraft and in the control tower. The usefulness of these technological advances is currently limited by today's air traffic control system, which involves the use of "freeways" in the Terminal RADAR Approach Control (TRACON) region around urban airports. These freeways are set approach patterns to runways which do not allow for the possibility of so-called "free flight" by an aircraft to its destination. Limiting the aircraft trajectories in this manner results in the addition of both planned and unplanned delays to air travel.

Reference-contexts: In order to improve the efficiency of the current ATC system, NASA Ames is developing a system which automates some parts of ATC. The system is called the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), and is described in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], and [3]. CTAS is a program 4 which generates advisories, or suggested trajectories, runway assignments, landing sequences, and schedules, which the controller may use in managing air traffic.

Reference-contexts: The functionality of CTAS is purely advisory: the controller still communicates verbally to the pilot of each aircraft, and may decide to use or ignore the information that CTAS provides. Field tests of CTAS are now underway at the Denver and Dallas/Fort Worth airports <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 Conflict & Coordination 3.1 The origins of conflict In a multiagent setting there is always the possibility of conflict between the objectives of the agents.

Reference-contexts: Clearly this approach will predict a lot more conflicts than the constant velocity extrapolation. If we assume that the aircraft in question is allowed to move away from its neighbors, conflict prediction becomes a pursuit-evasion dynamical game <ref> [6] </ref>, with the neighbors pursuing (doing their best to cause conflict) and our aircraft evading (doing its best to avoid it). Whenever a conflict is predicted the strategic planner is notified to resolve it. As discussed in Section 3 resolution is done by communication.

Reference-contexts: The kinematic model and the planning techniques used by the tactical level can play a crucial role in the closed loop system performance as well as the verification process. One approach, investigated in <ref> [7] </ref>, deals with the so-called "landing tower problem": given a sequence of way-points and times of arrival by the control tower, specifying the position and orientation of the aircraft, plan a trajectory through them. We approached this problem using a kinematic model for the motion of the aircraft. <p> We solve the 9 problem of steering the aircraft between the initial and final configurations, g o and g f in "optimal fashion", that is we determine trajectories that minimize: Z T 3 X u 2 This problem was solved in <ref> [7] </ref>. It was shown that the optimal inputs are elliptic functions (so-called Weierstrass P-functions). Computational procedures for steering the system have also been devised. One very interesting aspect of solution is that it includes helices, circles and straight line segments.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the problems associated with non-minimum phase dynamics consider a planar, dynamic CTOL model, which describes the lateral axis dynamics of the aircraft in normal aerodynamic flight <ref> [8] </ref>. The horizontal and vertical axes are respectively the x; z axes and is the angle made by the aircraft axis with the x axis (pitch angle).

Reference-contexts: These dynamics can become unstable, in view of the non-minimum phase nature of the plant.

The PATH control hierarchy consists of four layers: the regulation layer, coordination layer, link layer and network layer.

Reference-contexts: The hybrid nature of the AHS problem is due to two types of switching. The first is caused by switching between different maneuvers commanded by the coordination layer (planning) and the second is introduced because of the physical layer constraints. For example, for the autonomous vehicle controller of <ref> [19] </ref>, phase space based switching between different feedback control laws was introduced to guarantee that the system response to disturbances lies within state and input constraints due to actuator saturations and passenger comfort limitations respectively. Similarly, the air traffic management control system involves switching at different levels. <p> Most of the controllers will be relatively easy to analyze individually, using results from nonlinear control theory. The analysis of the overall switched system can be very tricky however, as indicated by the examples considered in <ref> [20, 19] </ref>. The problem becomes even more complicated when the planning layers are added to the picture.

Reference-contexts: The discrete part of the model can be designed and analyzed using standard tools (typically computational) such as Statemate or COSPAN. Even after this kind of analysis however we can not be sure that the resulting hybrid system will perform adequately. An investigation carried out on the AHS system <ref> [21] </ref> indicates that, even if the individual subsystems are verified independently, the overall system can fail in a critical way.
