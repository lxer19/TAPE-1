Abstract: Simulation of discharge pattern in nerve cells can provide a perspective opening into understanding of auditory processing. A PC based system for the modelling of the first and second-order auditory units have been created. The peripheral layer of our system is represented by a bank of linear filters. The impulse response of the filters simulated the impulse response of basilar membrane. A rectification (depolarization/hyperpolarization ratio is 3:1) and an integration with time constant of 0.2 ms is included in hair cell's models. The Gaussian noise simulated random fluctuations of neuron's threshold and membrane potential. We omitted a modelling an unproved phenomenon of hair cell transmitter depletion. The special attention was paid to a modelling of postspike changes in spiral ganglion cells. The hazard function of spontaneous activity in a typical auditory fiber could be properly reproduced in our model only in case when two components of refractoreness with time constants of 1 ms and 20 ms had been employed. If both of these components depended only on a time interval after one previous spike, the poststimulus histogram of the response to tone burst did not reveal any realistic adaptation behavior. However, if the long term refractoreness had been accumulated after successive spikes, a realistic shape of PSTH could be obtained. Models with different parameters as well as with an addition of inhibitory input were used for reproduction of discharge pattern in secondary auditory units. The dynamic properties of each model were described by PST histograms, phase histograms and cross-covariance functions (CCF) between the recorded discharge sequence and the modulation waveform. We compare discharge patterns for different variants of the model and real spike dischage sequences in secondary auditory units of the frog using the same methods of acquisition and processing. The model demonstrates the important role of delayed lateral inhibition for effective amplitude modulation encoding in cochlear nucleus neurons. Immunocytochemical, anatomical, and physiological evidence suggests that dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) principal cells, fusiform and giant cells, receive significant inhibitory input. Often, these cells display highly nonmonotonic input-output functions; in type IV units, as stimulus level at best frequency (BF) increases, discharge rate first increases above then decreases below spontaneous rate (SR). Pharmacological studies in anesthetized preparations have shown that most of the stimulus-evoked inhibition in principal cell responses is blocked by strychnine (Caspary et al. 1987; Evans and Zhao 1993), suggesting a predominance of glycinergic input; blocking GABA A mediated inhibition with bicuculline typically only increased a units SR. Recently, however, shock-evoked GABAergic post-synaptic potentials have been described in fusiform and cartwheel cells (Golding and Oertel 1996). Moreover, cartwheel cells are now known to respond to sound (Parham and Kim 1995; Davis and Young 1997) and contact both principal cell types (Golding and Oertel 1997); previously, cartwheel cells were not thought to affect DCN principal cell responses to sound. The goal of this study is to reassess the roles of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition in the DCN in light of the current understanding of DCN circuitry. Here, we report on the effects of iontophoretic application of strychnine and bicuculline on the responses of principal cells and interneurons in decerebrate cat. Consistent with previous studies, strychnine eliminates the central inhibitory area in type IV units (n=22) resulting in monotonic BF rate-level curves. Unexpectedly, bicuculline primarily lowers the threshold of on-BF inhibition and thereby enhances inhibition in type IV units (n=12); SR is typically unaffected. Similar contrasting effects of strychnine and bicuculline are observed in other principal cell response types (type IV-T and type III
