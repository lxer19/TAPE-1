Reference-contexts: For n 3 all simplicial polytopes with r vertices have the same f -vector, so the inequalities in Theorem 6.3 are equalities. The results in <ref> [Ag] </ref> show that the inequalities can be equalities for n = 4; r 12, but they are always strict inequalities for n = 4; r = 13: Agnarson proved that fi 1 (4; 13) = 77 while c 1 (4; 13) = 78; this also implies fi 2 (4; 13) &lt;

Reference-contexts: The minimal free resolution of a monomial ideal need not be a DG-algebra: Example 3.5. (Avramov, Backelin) There is no DG-algebra structure on the minimal free resolution of S=hx 2 ; xy 2 z; y 2 z 2 ; yz 2 w; w 2 i. This is proved in <ref> [Av, 5.2.3] </ref>. 4 On the other hand, the Taylor resolution of a monomial ideal is always a DG-algebra, and Theorem 3.2 has the following corollary: Corollary 3.6. If M is a generic monomial ideal, then the minimal free resolution of S=M is a quotient DG-algebra of the Taylor resolution.

Reference-contexts: The Scarf complex of this generic monomial ideal consists of two triangles and an edge meeting at a vertex. 8 Here M is contractible, but not shellable, even in the nonpure sense of <ref> [BW] </ref>. Theorem 5.1 will be derived from Proposition 5.3, which is an extension of Theorem 2.8.4 in [Sc, x2.8]. In Scarf's book the faces of M are called "primitive sets".

Reference-contexts: We also relate the Scarf complex to the irreducible decomposition of M and to the Cohen-Macaulay property (Theorem 3.7 and Corollary 3.9). In the literature we found only two general constructions for resolving arbitrary monomial ideals: Taylor's resolution (cf. <ref> [Ei, 17.11] </ref>) and Lyubeznik's subcomplex (see [Ly]). For a large number of generators these resolutions are very far from minimal and inefficient for applications.

For a large number of generators these resolutions are very far from minimal and inefficient for applications. In Section 4 we obtain a nonminimal free resolution which comes from Construction 2.1 and has length at most the number of variables, so it is much smaller than Taylor's. <p> This is a free resolution of S=M over S having length r and 2 r terms. It is very far from minimal if r n. A smaller resolution based on Taylor's resolution was constructed in <ref> [Ly] </ref>. Every simplicial complex on f1; : : : ; rg defines a submodule F := L of the Taylor resolution F which is closed under the differential (2.1). This N n -graded complex of free S-modules is described in more detail in the next construction.

Reference-contexts: One of the central ideas in this paper is that there exists a genericity condition, which ensures simply structured homological behavior. The same idea is developed further for toric varieties in <ref> [PS] </ref>. We call a monomial ideal M generic if no variable x i appears with the same nonzero exponent in two distinct minimal generators of M .

We call M the Scarf complex of M . Taylor's resolution F is a direct sum of the minimal free resolution of S=M and trivial complexes 0 ! S (a I ) ! S (a I ) ! 0. <p> Theorem 5.1 will be derived from Proposition 5.3, which is an extension of Theorem 2.8.4 in <ref> [Sc, x2.8] </ref>. In Scarf's book the faces of M are called "primitive sets".

Let M be a generic monomial ideal. There exists a polytope P M in R n such that M is isomorphic to the subcomplex of the boundary of P M consisting of all faces supported by a strictly positive inner normal vector. Construction 5.4. <ref> [Sc] </ref> One possible choice of a polytope P M satisfying Proposition 5.3 is as follows. Let a i = (a i1 ; a i2 ; : : : ; a in ) 2 N n be the exponent vector of the i-th minimal generator of M .

Reference-contexts: We next relate Scarf complexes to the dimension theory of partially ordered sets (see <ref> [Tr] </ref>). Recall that the order dimension odim (P) of a finite poset P is the smallest number s of linear extensions L 1 ; : : : ; L s of P such that L 1 " : : : " L s = P. <p> Hence = M . 12 Corollary 6.5. fi i1 (n; r) equals the largest cardinality of a family F of i-sets in f1; : : :; rg such that the simplicial complex spanned by F has order dimension n.

Therefore fi 1 (n; r) r A central topic in discrete geometry is the Steinitz Problem of characterizing the face lattices of all convex polytopes. <p> Theorem 6.4 implies that (a) and (b) are equivalent. This realizability problem is trivial for n 2 variables. In three variables it is nontrivial but solved by a theorem of Schnyder (see <ref> [Tr] </ref>): for any triangulation of a triangle there exists a generic Artinian monomial ideal M k [x; y; z] such that = M . The analogous result does not hold for n = 4: Theorem 6.6.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 5.5. If M is Artinian and generic, then M is a regular triangulation of the (n 1)-simplex. Proof: See <ref> [Zi] </ref> for the definition and basic properties of regular triangulations. The polytope P M lies in the positive orthant and intersects each coordinate axis. Each face of P M visible from the origin is a simplex. The set of these faces is M . Example 5.6. <p> Take the resulting generic Artinian monomial ideal M and apply Corollary 3.3 (1). Each Scarf complex M considered in Corollary 6.2 is the boundary of a simplicial n-polytope with at least one facet removed, by Corollary 5.5. The Upper Bound Theorem for Convex Polytopes (cf. <ref> [Zi, Thm. 8.23] </ref>) implies the following result: 11 Theorem 6.3. The Betti numbers of monomial ideals satisfy the inequalities of the Upper Bound Theorem for Convex Polytopes. <p> More precisely, if c i (n; r) denotes the number of i-dimensional faces of the cyclic n-polytope with r vertices, then fi i (n; r) c i (n; r) for 1 i n 2; An explicit formula for c i (n; r) is given in <ref> [Zi, x8] </ref>. For instance, c 1 (3; r) = 3r 6; c 2 (3; r) = 2r 4 and c 1 (4; r) = 2 ; c 2 (4; r) = r (r 3); c 3 (4; r) = r (r 3)=2. <p> Therefore fi 1 (n; r) r A central topic in discrete geometry is the Steinitz Problem of characterizing the face lattices of all convex polytopes. While this problem has a beautiful solution due to Steinitz in dimension 3 <ref> [Zi, Theorem 4.1] </ref>, recent work of Richter-Gebert [Ri] shows that the Steinitz Problem for 4-dimensional polytopes is essentially equivalent to classifying all semialgebraic varieties (and hence intractible).
