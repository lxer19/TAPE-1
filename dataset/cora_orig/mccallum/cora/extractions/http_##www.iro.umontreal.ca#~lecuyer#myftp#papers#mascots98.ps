Title: An Empirical Comparison of Diffusion Approximations and Simulation in ATM Networks

Abstract: We consider an ATM switch model, in which each of N sources is a Markov modulated rate process. We look at some approximations that have been proposed for p, the probability that in steady-state conditions, the buffer content exceeds x. These approximations are compared with the simulation results for p and the cell-loss ratio.

Reference-contexts: In the case of a Markov fluid model, we can use limit theorems for generalizations of the multi-urn Ehrenfest model, [3], [7], to show that f X (t); t 0g is an O-U process. In the general case of a Markov modulated rate process, a result stated in <ref> [2] </ref> tells us that f X (t); t 0g is a Gaussian process, not necessarily Markov. In fact, the only stationary and continuous process that is Gaussian and Markov is the O-U process and in the Markov fluid model, this property follows from the assumption of exponential sojourn times.

The approximation deteriorates when p gets too small. In <ref> [4] </ref>, the parameters were chosen so that the approximation was quite accurate. Moreover, results were given only for p &gt; 10 5 . Here, we investigate many sets of parameters and exhibit examples where the approximation is bad, so that practitioners have an idea of when these approximations are dangerous. <p> Their result can only be proven rigourously in the case of a Markov fluid model. 2.2. The approximation of Kobayashi and Ren Once we have an O-U process for X, two approaches can be used to approximate p. The first one is the idea used in <ref> [4] </ref>. From fX (t); t 0g, they define the super posed Gaussian traffic process R (t) = P M1 (the non-restrictive assumption that R M = 0 is also made). <p> Conclusion We have explained how the approximation for p was constructed in <ref> [4] </ref> and how an upper bound was derived in [1]. In both cases, the key is to approximate f n (t); t 0g by a diffusion process f X (t); t 0g, which must be an O-U process in the former case. <p> We also showed the similarities between these two quantities.
