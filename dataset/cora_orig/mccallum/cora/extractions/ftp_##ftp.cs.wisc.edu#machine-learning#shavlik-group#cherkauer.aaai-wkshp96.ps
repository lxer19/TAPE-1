Abstract: This paper presents the Plannett system, which combines artificial neural networks to achieve expert- level accuracy on the difficult scientific task of recognizing volcanos in radar images of the surface of the planet Venus. Plannett uses ANNs that vary along two dimensions: the set of input features used to train and the number of hidden units. The ANNs are combined simply by averaging their output activations. When Plannett is used as the classification module of a three-stage image analysis system called JAR- tool, the end-to-end accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is as good as that of a human planetary geologist on a four-image test suite. JARtool-Plannett also achieves the best algorithmic accuracy on these images to date.

Reference-contexts: To analyze this data, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Labo- ratory (JPL) have developed an AI system, JARtool <ref> (Burl et al. 1994) </ref>, to automatically detect and catalog the approximately one million small volcanos estimated to be visible in the images, as a prelude to more advanced planetary geology studies. <p> It consists of 163 volcanos in four sample Magellan-SAR images. (Smyth et al. (1995) describe an alternative, algorithmic approach to estimating ground truth from the individual labelings of many experts.) The Current JARtool-Gauss System JPL's current JARtool system <ref> (Burl et al. 1994) </ref>, called here JARtool-Gauss, consists of three mod <br>- ules * Focus of Attention * Feature Measurement * Classification The focus of attention (FOA) module uses a matched filter to quickly scan the entire image database for regions possibly containing volcanos. <p> It uses ML techniques and a set of labeled training examples to learn to distinguish volcanos from false alarms, and then classifies each candidate according to what it has learned. JARtool-Gauss uses a simple Gaussian classifier <ref> (Burl et al. 1994) </ref>, called here Gauss, as its classification module. <p> Gauss currently does not use the other 112 available features. 1 In <ref> (Burl et al. 1994) </ref>, Gauss did not use the petal feature, but further work has shown that including it slightly improves accuracy. The New JARtool-Plannett System Plannett is an ML system that replaces JARtool- Gauss's current Gauss classification module to produce a new algorithm, JARtool-Plannett.

Reference-contexts: Because there is a wide variation in the labelings created by individual experts, the ground truth used for this study was the consensus of two planetary geologists who discussed and labeled the images together <ref> (Fayyad & Smyth 1993) </ref>. This is the ground truth labeling used for most of the JAR- tool work at JPL.

Reference-contexts: 12 RMS reconstruction errors, each at three different image patch resolutions (72 features); average energies collected along 18 radii and 7 concentric rings of the Fast Fourier Transform of each patch (25 features); 7 features of the dark, medium, and bright regions of each patch, segmented using the algorithm of <ref> (Pappas 1992) </ref> (21 features); and the maximum response of an orientation-dependent "petal" filter that responds most strongly to elongated, linear objects (1 feature). (A high petal response is thus evidence against a volcano.) The classification module then uses the measured features to decide which candidate patches actually contain volcanos.

Reference-contexts: We developed Plannett in an attempt to take advantage of the information contained in all 119 available input features. Plannett consists of a set of 32 feed-forward ANNs individually trained to distinguish volcanos from nonvolcanos using back propagation <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams 1986) </ref>, and combined by averaging their output activations. The ANNs contain an input layer, two output nodes (volcano and nonvolcano), and an optional hidden layer.
