Abstract: The thermoplastic composite tow-placement technology is a non-autoclave consolidation process that offers the potential to significantly reduce fabrication costs. A set of process models that capture the important process phenomena heat transfer, intimate contact, healing, consolidation, and polymer degradation has been developed. The models have the capability of operating in the critical, highly transient regions caused by process startup or geometrically imposed velocity changes, where process quality must be maintained. These models have been incorporated into an online process simulator that allows interactive exploration of the process window by varying the control parameters and observing the model outputs. To reduce the time it takes to converge on a solution, an artificial neural network (ANN) version of the simulation has been developed. Preliminary trials on the ANN, which incorporates recently developed process models, show great promise i n decreasing computation time while maintaining sufficient accuracy. The automated tow placement process is well established for thermoset composites. In this process, a band of tows is placed onto a tool surface, followed by vacuum bagging and autoclave consolidation and cure. In the present study, ATP of thermoplastic composites is being investigated as a rapid affordable technology for the fabrication of composite parts. The components are manufactured b y applying adequate heat and pressure to a thermoplastic prepreg tape so that welding is achieved at the interface, and consolidation is obtained within the composite tow. The degree of bonding and final void content directly affect the mechanical properties of the material, and as a result a number of theoretical models of the material's dynamic response t o transient force and thermal loading have been developed and are presented in this work [1,2]. A modified thermal gas impingement solution was used to generate the temperature field used in this study. Heat transfer model predictions were then compared with experimental data gathered through an AGEMA thermal imaging system. A simplified coupled bonding model was developed and incorporated into the solution, which takes into account the mechanisms of healing and intimate contact simultaneously. A neural network simulation with an optimized control system aimed at improving quality was developed and used to carry out a series of parametric studies for an AS4/PEKK material system. Neural networks provide the capability of highly nonlinear mapping. To train a feedforward neural network, input and output training patterns created by the process models are used to minimize the error between the computed and known output. As a result, a fast yet accurate model of the tow-placement process i s The robotic head used by the Center for Composite Materials is composed of a series of nitrogen gas torches and laydown rollers in the configuration shown in Figure 1. The first torch and roller are used to preheat and induce intimate contact of the incoming tow and substrate, and the second torch provides supplemental through-thickness heating t o facilitate consolidation and bonding of the tow under the second roller. The forces applied to each roller can be independently controlled so that controlled pressures are applied to the composite interface in the melt regions. where a is dependent on the material's thermal properties i n the through-thickness direction. The problem domain i s divided into three regions as shown in Figure 2: the incoming tow (I), upstream composite substrate (II), and downstream consolidated composite (III). The surface heat transfer coefficients are based on the compilation of results for forced jet-impingement, conduction at the roller contact points, and free convection at the incoming tow and downstream region. The mandrel is included in the problem domain as it was found, through experiment, to act as a significant heat sink, especially during the start of the manufacturing process. A more detailed study of impinging jet heat transfer can be found in [4].
