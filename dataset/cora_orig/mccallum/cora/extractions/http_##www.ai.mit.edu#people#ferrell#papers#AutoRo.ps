Hannibal measures 14 inches long, stands eight inches high, and weight 6 pounds. Because Hannibal is small, it has relatively low mass which gives rise to several advantages, including reduced dynamic effects, which simplifies control.

Other researchers have arrived at the proper weighting of influences through optimization techniques <ref> (Beer & Gallagher 1992) </ref>, or by experimentation (Quinn & Espenschied 1993), (Ferrell 1993). Another drawback is the difficulty in adding new behaviors. The controller mechanisms interact in a very specialized way to produce gait coordination. Consequently it is difficult to incorporate dramatically different behaviors without disrupting controller dynamics.

Hannibal measures 14 inches long, stands eight inches high, and weight 6 pounds. <p> In this paper, we define combinations of AFSMs as either behaviors if their processing results in an outwardly observable affect, or agents if their processing has only an internal affect. Behaviors and agents are the building blocks of the Behavior Language <ref> (Brooks 1990) </ref>. Hannibal is programmed in Behavior Language, a high level language for writing sub-sumption programs.

Reference-contexts: Posterior extreme position (PEP): In forward walking, this is the target position of the swing degree of freedom during the power stroke. 5.2 Cruse Cruse (1994) describes a neural net implementation of a locomotion controller modeled after the neural control of walking stick insects <ref> (Cruse 1980) </ref>. The controller is implemented in simulation where an agent with walking-stick insect mechanics locomotes over flat or irregular terrain and can be subjected to various leg perturbations.

Reference-contexts: mutually inhibitory connections between the pacemaker neurons of adjacent legs generates statically stable gaits, and phase-locking the pacemaker neurons on each side of the body enforces metachronal waves. 5 INSECT-INSPIRED LOCOMOTION 18 5.4 SSA Hexapod In the early 80s, Marc Donner implemented an insect-inspired locomotion controller on the SSA Hexapod <ref> (Donner 1987) </ref>. The SSA is a large hexapod built at CMU by Dr. Ivan Sutherland of Sutherland, Sproull, and Associates. The robot has a 100 inch steel frame, weighs 1800 pounds, and can carry a human operator. <p> It is not clear how to modify the current mechanisms to incorporate such an asymmetrical behavior. A typical approach is to simply add some sort of centralized process on top of the locomotion network that can override it <ref> (Donner 1987) </ref>, but this detracts from the elegance of the reflexive approach. Finally, there is a long way to go before robots using reflexive control schemes can locomote like insects over naturally occurring terrain. Typical mechanisms don't account for a lot of rough terrain locomotion behaviors observed in insects.

Reference-contexts: The robot must be able to detect these terrain variations and adapt to them accordingly.

The robot must recognize these faults and minimize their effect on the robot's performance <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>.

These qualities are important as more capabilities are added to controllers. <p> Hannibal also has a comparatively large behavior repertoire including insect-like gaits and rough terrain locomotion as well as extensive failure recognition, fault tolerance, and sensor processing capabilities <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>, (Ferrell 1994). The fully compiled system consists of approximately 1500 AFSMs performing diverse tasks. <p> The local leg controllers run simultaneously; however, they are not independent of one another. The six legs must work together as a team for the robot to move effectively. Using this approach, we have implemented the following basic locomotion capabilities on Hannibal <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>: * Walk in a statically stable manner * Change speed by switching among a variety of insect-like gaits (wave gaits) * Change direction of travel * Turn with various radii of curvature * Compensate for broken legs For space limitations, we only present the implementation of the first two <p> Legs communicate with each other not only to coordinate and synchronize their behavior, but also to alert each other of hazards and to recruit the help of the other legs when necessary. Using this approach, we have implemented the following capabilities on Hannibal <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>: (For space limitations, we do not present all of these capabilities in this paper.) * Walk over small and medium sized obstacles * Avoid large obstacles blocking the robot's path * Search for footholds * Walk over holes * Avoid cliffs * Adapt gait to terrain roughness * Adapt <p> Other researchers have arrived at the proper weighting of influences through optimization techniques (Beer & Gallagher 1992), or by experimentation (Quinn & Espenschied 1993), <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>.

They investigated the neural systems that control walking in the cockroach (Wilson 1966), <ref> (Pearson 1976) </ref> and developed neurological models to explain the control of an individual leg and the coordination between legs. 6.1 Step Cycle Generation In Pearson's model for individual leg control, a pacemaker on each leg is responsible for generating the cyclic motion of the leg (see figure 3).

Reference-contexts: The controller mechanisms interact in a very specialized way to produce gait coordination. Consequently it is difficult to incorporate dramatically different behaviors without disrupting controller dynamics. For example, locusts use rapid searching movements with a leg to locate a secure foothold <ref> (Pearson & Franklin 1984) </ref>. This behavior is characterized by rapid, repeated cycling of a single leg while the other legs may even come to rest. It is not clear how to modify the current mechanisms to incorporate such an asymmetrical behavior.
