Abstract: A snap fastener is a deformable device consisting of a pair of mating surfaces that "snap" together during assembly. Because of the simple, linear assembly motion, such latching micro fasteners have a wide range of applications in micro assembly tasks, e.g. for devices with multiple or layered components, or micro opto-mechanical plugs. At the micro scale, conventional types of fasteners like screws and hinges are unlikely to work due to present fabrication constraints and large friction forces. Micro snap fasteners also have great potential to be used as sensors with memory. We present a detailed theoretical analysis of design and function of micro snap fasteners, and describe the fabrication in single crystal silicon (SCS) technology. We perform experiments on snap fasteners with 1 - 2 m wide latches. Independent comb drive actuators generating micro-Newton forces were used for actuation of the fasteners to verify the theoretically obtained design rules. Our experimental results are in close accordance with the theoretical predictions.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION We have designed, analyzed, fabricated and characterized SCS micro snap fasteners. A standard SCREAM process <ref> (Zhang and MacDonald 1992, Shaw et al. 1993) </ref> was used to fabricate various designs of the fasteners. The stiffness of the snap fastener (i.e. the force required to engage the micro fastener latches) was tested using electrostatic micro comb actuators. <p> The layout of the complete device comprising of the fastener latches and the two actuators was drawn using SYMBAD, a CAD package for IC circuits. SCREAM <ref> (Zhang and MacDonald 1992, Shaw et al. 1993) </ref> is a single mask, reactive ion etching process for the fabrication of submicron, movable single-crystal silicon electromechanical structures. We followed a variation of SCREAM for releasing 2 m wide beams.

Reference-contexts: Each actuator has N = 350 fingers on ladder beams. The final gap between fingers after fabrication is d = 1:5 m, and the height of the fingers is h = 8:5 m. The force generated by these actuators is given <ref> (Prasad et al. 1995) </ref> by the formula f = 2 which for our values is f = 1:32 fi 10 8 (V 2 ) N, for a voltage V in volts. We can apply up to 80 V across the fingers without break down of the passivating oxide layer.
