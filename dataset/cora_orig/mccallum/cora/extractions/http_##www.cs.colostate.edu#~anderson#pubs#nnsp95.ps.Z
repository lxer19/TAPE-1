Abstract: If several mental states can be reliably distinguished by recognizing patterns in EEG, then a paralyzed person could communicate to a device like a wheelchair by composing sequencesof these mental states. In this article, we report on a study comparing four representations of EEG signals and their classification by a two-layer neural network with sigmoid activation functions. The neural network is implemented on a CNAPS server (128 processor, SIMD architecture) by Adaptive Solutions, Inc., gaining a 100-fold decrease in training time over a Sun

Reference-contexts: With ten parts, we can choose 90 different pairs for cross-validation and testing. The results in the next section are averages over 90 runs constructed in this way. Training was performed with the bnlib error back-propagation library on a 128-node CNAPS Server II from Adaptive Solutions, Inc.. <ref> [1] </ref> present details of the implementation. The CNAPS implementation ran for 4 minutes to train a 40 hidden unit net for 1,000 epochs on the unprocessed data representation, whereas a Sparc 10 required about 9 hours, over 100 times longer.

Asymmetries were most reliably found for motor tasks. In a recent study, [11] used a frequency-based representation of EEG from two electrodes to obtain 85% accuracy in predicting movements of the finger of a subject moving a joystick left or right.

Reference-contexts: Such signals are referred to as event-related potentials, or ERP's. An example of how ERP's can be used to communicate with a computer is the work of <ref> [3] </ref>, who used ERP's to detect which letter of the alphabet a human subject wished to select. This kind of interaction between a person and stimulus device is currently too cumbersome and slow to be useful in a real-time control application.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Computerized analysis of EEG signals has evolved over the past three decades <ref> [5] </ref> with much of the effort directed towards a better understanding of the functioning of the brain. The work reported here has a different goalto extract information from EEG signals with which mental states can be discriminated and thereby serve as a mode of communication for a paralyzed person.

Reference-contexts: Subjects were seated in a sound-proof, dimly-lit, room. As shown in Figure 1, electrodes were placed at O 1 , O 2 , P 3 , P 4 , C 3 , and C 4 , standard electrode locations in the 10-20 System <ref> [6] </ref>. The electrodes were connected to Grass 7P511 amplifiers that bandpass filtered the signals at 0.1-100 Hz. The EEG signals were sampled at 250 samples per second and digitized with 12 bits of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Other problems are more cognitive in nature; the concentration of a person can vary while the person is supposedly performing a single mental task. The work described in this article is based on previous work <ref> [7] </ref> using a Bayesian classifier trained and tested on a small subset of data recorded from subjects performing several mental tasks. <p> If the information needed to discriminate mental state can be extracted from the unprocessed EEG signals, or at most preprocessed by projecting to a relatively small number of principal components, then we can dispense with other forms of preprocessing, such as the frequency analysis used in <ref> [7] </ref>. In one other study [10] neural networks were applied to classify EEG signals collected in a paradigm similar to that of [7]. Kohonen's SOM algorithm [8] was used to train a matrix of units to identify clusters of similar patterns and associate each cluster with a particular mental task. <p> most preprocessed by projecting to a relatively small number of principal components, then we can dispense with other forms of preprocessing, such as the frequency analysis used in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Kohonen's SOM algorithm [8] was used to train a matrix of units to identify clusters of similar patterns and associate each cluster with a particular mental task. <p> Results of experiments with data from a single subject and a pair of tasks are shown in Section 3 and conclusions are discussed in Section 4. 2 METHOD 2.1 DATA COLLECTION All data used in this study were recorded during the previous study <ref> [7] </ref>. Selection of the set of mental tasks was guided by [4] whose results showed detectable hemispheric differences for certain tasks. Here we focus on two tasks: BaselineAlpha Wave Production The subject is asked to relax and try to think of nothing in particular. <p> Each session resulted in 250 samples/second x 10 seconds x 6 channels, or 15,000 values. For the experiments reported here, artifacts, such as eye blinks, were not removed. 2.2 UNPROCESSED REPRESENTATION In <ref> [7] </ref> it was found that quarter-second segments of the 10 second data resulted in classification accuracy approximately the same as that obtained from two second segments. <p> For the baseline and mental arithmetic data used in our experiments, i = 50. Therefore, the K-L representation was formed by projecting each 372-dimensional pattern onto the first 50 eigenvalues. 2.4 FREQUENCY-BAND REPRESENTATION In <ref> [7] </ref> features were extracted from spectral density estimates using asymmetry ratios given by (R L)=(R + L), where R is the area under the spectral density curve of a right hemisphere channel for a specific frequency band and L is defined similarly for the corresponding left hemisphere channel. <p> In the current study, the spectral density was estimated from autoregressive (AR) parameters calculated using the Burg method [12]. An AR model of order 6 is used here since it yielded good results in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.5 CLASSIFICATION Classification was performed by fully-connected, feed-forward neural networks with single hidden layers of varying size. All units use an asymmetric sigmoid activation function. The work reported here involved a single pair of tasks, the mental arithmetic and baseline tasks, so the networks require only one output unit.
