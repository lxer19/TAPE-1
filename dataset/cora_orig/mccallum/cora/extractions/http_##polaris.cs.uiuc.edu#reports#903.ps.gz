Title: EFFICIENT PARALLEL SOLUTION OF PARABOLIC EQUATIONS: IMPLICIT METHODS ON THE CEDAR MULTICLUSTER  
Author: E. GALLOPOULOS AND Y. SAAD 
Abstract: We present a class of implicit methods for the parallel solution of linear parabolic differential equations based on Pade and Chebyshev rational approximations to the matrix exponential. The proposed approach offers the advantages of natural hierarchical parallelism, and better intrinsic efficiency. Moreover, if the goal is to compute the solution at a given time point as quickly as possible, fewer timesteps are required in general. These advantages lead to an extremely fast family of methods for the solution of certain time-dependent problems. We illustrate these techniques with numerical experiments on the University of Illinois Cedar multicluster architecture.

Reference-contexts: We also note that if A is symmetric, positive definite and (A) (0; R), then (At) (1; 0) and we can use rational Chebyshev approximation to e z in the interval (1; 0). These approximations are fully documented in the literature <ref> [2] </ref>. It is known that if A is Hermitian positive definite, then inf fke At p m (At)q m (At) 1 k 2 g fl m;m Constant fi [9:289025::] m What is particularly attractive with this approximation is that it is valid for any t.

Reference-contexts: It is only recently that a discussion of methods of degree greater than 4 for parabolic problems has been made. The reason is the po tential for efficient implementation of such methods on computers with vector ([16]) and multiprocessing capabilities ([13, 10]). This is described next. 1 Reference <ref> [3] </ref> is an exception, since it goes up to 6. 2 2.1. Implementation of high degree schemes. It can be shown that the poles of the diagonal Pade and Chebyshev approximations we are interested in, are distinct. <p> Although most research has followed the path of the Pade type approximations, Varga and co-workers have pointed to the advantage of Chebyshev rational approximations in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Partial fraction expansion in the context of time-dependent problems was described by Zakian [21] and Law-son and Swayne [15, 18].

Reference-contexts: The quadratic factor can be a nuisance, because of the additional storage and the squared condition number. We choose instead to deal with the complex systems. When is real we use Conjugate Gradient iterations <ref> [5] </ref>. Otherwise let ff + fi. Then the matrix (A ffI) fiI is non-Hermitian. Numerical experience as well as a series of investigations by Varga show that in the case of Pade, ff 2, whereas for Chebyshev jj &gt; 0:5.

Reference-contexts: Hence if A is symmetric positive definite, a direct method can be applied without pivoting [17]. For multi-dimensional problems, an iterative method is likely to be more economical. For A symmetric, we have implemented on one Cedar cluster a minimal residual iterative scheme due to R.
