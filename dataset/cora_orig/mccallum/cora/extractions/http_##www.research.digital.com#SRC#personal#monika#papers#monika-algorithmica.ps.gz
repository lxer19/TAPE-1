Title: Lower Bounds for Fully Dynamic Connectivity Problems in Graphs  
Author: Michael L. Fredman Monika Rauch Henzinger 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds on the complexity of maintaining fully dynamic k-edge or k-vertex connectivity in plane graphs and in (k 1)-vertex connected graphs. We show an amortized lower bound of (log n=k(log log n + log b)) per edge insertion, deletion, or query operation in the cell probe model, where b is the word size of the machine and n is the number of vertices in G. We also show an amortized lower bound of (log n=(log log n + log b)) per operation for fully dynamic planarity testing in embedded graphs. These are the first lower bounds for fully dynamic connectivity problems.

Reference-contexts: We define the helpful parity prefix sum problem and reduce the helpful parity prefix sum problem to the dynamic problem. The parity prefix sum problem is defined as follows: Given an array A <ref> [1] </ref>; : : : ; A [n] of integers mod 2 with initial value zero execute an arbitary sequence of the following operations: Add (l): Increase A [l] by 1. <p> Using the lower bounds of <ref> [1] </ref> for the parity prefix sum problem and the helpful parity prefix sum problem and the same reductions as in the previous sections we obtain a lower bound of (log n= log log n) if the data structure uses space that is polynomial in n and a lower bound of (log

Reference-contexts: An embedding of a graph G is uniquely determined by fixing at each vertex the order of its incident edges. Two nodes x and y are k-edge (k-vertex) connected if there are k edge-disjoint (vertex-disjoint) paths connecting them. For further terminology we refer to <ref> [6] </ref>. Given a graph G, the fully dynamic k-edge (k-vertex) connectivity problem is to execute the following operations in arbitrary order: Insert (u; v) : Add the edge (u; v) to G. Delete (u; v) : Remove the edge (u; v) from G.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper shows lower bounds for fully dynamic data structures by giving reductions to the parity prefix sum problem <ref> [7] </ref>. We call a graph G plane if G is planar and we are given a fixed embedding of G. An embedding of a graph G is uniquely determined by fixing at each vertex the order of its incident edges. <p> Otherwise, do nothing. Sum (l): Return S l mod 2, where S l = P l 3 Fredman and Saks <ref> [7] </ref> show that there exists a sequence of m operations for the parity prefix sum problem that take time (m log n=(log log n + log b)) in the cell probe model with word size b.
