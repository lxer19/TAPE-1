Abstract: A constrained contour is an outline of a region of interest, obtained by linking edges under the constraints of connectivity, smoothness, image context and subjective or user specified constraints. We discuss a constrained contouring algorithm in polar coordinates to trace closed contours. The algorithm finds optimal contour locations in all radial direction according to the constraints of context, distance from approximate contour and the image gradient. These optimal edge-points ordered according to their angular coordinates. We treat these edge points as the nodes of a graph of all possible contours. The links of the graph are weighted so that the shortest path between a pair of nodes is the smooth contour that traces maximum number of edge-points, and the shortest cycle in the graph gives the optimal contour.

A contour outlining a nonrigid shape is therefore modeled as an object with membrane and thin plate like characteristics [6].
