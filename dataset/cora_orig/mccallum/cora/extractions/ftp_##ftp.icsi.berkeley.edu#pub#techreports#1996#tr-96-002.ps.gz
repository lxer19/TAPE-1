Abstract: We report on a joint project with Joe Buhler, Richard Crandall, Reijo Ernvall, and Tauno Metsankyla dealing with the computation of irregular primes and cyclo-tomic invariants for primes between four and eight million. This extends previous computations of Buhler et al. [4]. Our computation of the irregular primes is based on a new approach which has originated in the study of Stickelberger codes [13]. It reduces the problem to that of finding zeros of a polynomial over F p of degree &lt; (p1)=2 among the quadratic residues. Use of fast polynomial gcd-algorithms gives an O(p log 2 p log log p)-algorithm for this task. By employing the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication combined with a version of fast multiple evaluation of polynomials we design an algorithm with running time O(p log p log log p). This algorithm is particularly efficient when run on primes p for which p 1 has small prime factors. We also give some improvements on the previous implementations for computing the cyclotomic invariants of a prime.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in a lower bound for the non scalar complexity L (F ) of F over K. Let @ i denote the derivation morphism @=@x i of K (x 0 ; : : : ; x n1 ). By the Baur-Strassen derivative inequality <ref> [1] </ref> we have 3L (F ) L (F; @ 0 F; : : : ; @ n1 F ): Note that @ i F = F f 0 (x i )=f (x i ).

Reference-contexts: quadratic nonresidues, and f = . (Timings for this and the following more sophisticated versions on some specific primes are provided by the table at the end of this section.) A major improvement can be gained by employing an idea related to the multiple evaluation algorithm of Borodin and Moenck <ref> [2] </ref>. First, note that by multiplying the ith 3 coefficient of with w i , we are left with the problem of finding the zeros of the resulting polynomial among the quadratic residues of F fi p .

Reference-contexts: This paper also contains a nice account on the history of these computations prior to its appearance. Wagstaff's tables were extended by Tanner and Wagstaff [15] to primes below 150000. Both these approaches were quadratic, i.e., their running time was proportional to p 2 .

Large-scale computations are vulnerable to all sorts of errors, so besides the cross-check facility, it is good to have some sort of checksum identity to check the results.

Reference-contexts: Their elegant approach is based on the inversion of the power series (e x 1)=x = P 1 modulo x p1 over F p . This method, combined with further memory saving strategies, was taken up again by Buhler, Crandall, Ernvall, and Metsankyla <ref> [4] </ref> to extend previous computations to four million. In this article, we report on a new approach to compute irregular pairs for primes below eight million. <p> In this section we will report on two such applications, which, up to now have always accompanied the computations of the irregular pairs, see <ref> [4, 6, 7, 15, 17] </ref>.

It is clear that this method requires at least 4N bytes of memory for storing the quotients q a . Our slightly modified method reduces the memory requirement by a factor of 1/32, at the expense of some overhead in the computation. <p> We will use the two implementations to randomly cross-check the results obtained by us and by Buhler-Crandall's implementation. Large-scale computations are vulnerable to all sorts of errors, so besides the cross-check facility, it is good to have some sort of checksum identity to check the results. Buhler et al. <ref> [3, 4] </ref> use the identity P p3 n=0 2 n (n + 1)B n 4 mod p. <p> Among the primes investigated by our program, we found two of index seven: 5,216,111 and 5,620,861.

Reference-contexts: Then, for each h encountered, we compute its transform, multiply it with the transform of v, and transform the product back. This reduces the number of Fourier transforms per polynomial multiplication from three to two. Another improvement can be gained using an idea of D. Reischert <ref> [8] </ref>: If p is not a Fermat prime, then the largest prime factor q t of p 1 is odd, hence we have to perform a negacyclic convolution of h (x) and v (x).

Reference-contexts: Translated into integer multiplication, this means that we are performing multiplication modulo 2 m + 1 for some m. If m is such that 32m = 2 k l &lt; (2k 1)2 2k , then one can perform the Schonhage-Strassen multiplication algorithm to compute this integer product. (See <ref> [10, p. 32] </ref>.) The advantage over the method which multiplies h and v as integers and reduces the product mod x q t + 1 is that the length of the numbers to be multiplied is smaller.

Reference-contexts: Even neglecting the cost of the factorization step, this algorithm would be of order O (p log 2 p log log p). We are interested in a faster algorithm, i.e., one of order O (p log p log log p). Following a suggestion of Schonhage <ref> [11] </ref>, we will first transform this problem to an instance of integer multiplication. For reasons to become clear later, we will consider a more general setup: Problem 2.

Reference-contexts: The running time of this algorithm is clearly dominated by the time needed to multiply two integers of bit-length dm, which, using the Schonhage-Strassen algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>, is O (dm log dm log log dm).
