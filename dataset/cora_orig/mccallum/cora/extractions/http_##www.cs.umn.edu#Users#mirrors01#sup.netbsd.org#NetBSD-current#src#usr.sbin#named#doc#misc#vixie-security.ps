Title: DNS and BIND Security Issues  
Author: Paul Vixie 
Keyword: Internet Software Consortium  
Date: May, 1995  
Note: Originally published in the proceedings of the 5th Usenix Security Symposium  2  
Abstract: Efforts are underway to add security to the DNS protocol. We have observed that if BIND would just do what the DNS specications say it should do, stop crashing, and start checking its inputs, then most of the existing security holes in DNS as practiced would go away. To be sure, attackers would still have a pretty easy time co-opting DNS in their break-in attempts. Our aim has been to get BIND to the point where its only vulnerabilities are due to the DNS protocol, and not to the implementation. This paper describes our progress to date.

Reference-contexts: This promiscuity is the source of most of BIND 's bad reputation in both the operations and the security elds. Other servers are free to put almost anything into the response, even if it has nothing to do with the query. As shown in <ref> [Bel95a] </ref>, this has disasterous effects on security.

Reference-contexts: So let's have a look at the packets, shall we? After that we'll take a look at the ways they can be perverted. We do not intend to present an exhaustive description of DNS --- <ref> [RFC1034] </ref> and [RFC1035] already ll that need. Our goal in this section is to present enough information about DNS that someone unfamiliar with its details can still understand the security ramications of some of DNS 's design choices.

Reference-contexts: By restrict we mean that BIND will be conservative both in what it generates and what it accepts. This may y in the face of the Robustness Principle 1 of <ref> [RFC1123] </ref>, but the old behaviour was just simply wrong. 6. What We Cannot Fix We are counting on the IETF DNSSEC effort to bring us a DNS protocol revision that authoritatively signs responses.

Reference-contexts: Sessions (whether TELNET , NFS , or whatever) should require something stronger than trying to determine a host's name and and then looking for that name in some statically congured list. ([RFC1510] and <ref> [RFC1760] </ref> are each cause for optimism.) From the bottom, though, these weaknesses all come with particular sets of details and can be described in terms of DNS protocol elements. As implementors we are more interested in this view than in the more political questions of Global Internet Authentication.
