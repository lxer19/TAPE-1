Title: Time/Space Trade-offs in Route Server Implementation

Abstract: At some exchange points, border routers peer with a Route Server instead. The Route Server computes a set of routes on behalf of each of its client border routers. A Route Server implementation that maintains a separate table of routes for each client can be memory intensive; the worst-case route storage requirement of such an implementation is more than 650 MB in some configurations. We describe optimizations that trade-off Route Server route processing for an order of magnitude reduction in route storage requirements.

Reference-contexts: The latter alternatives may require worst-case view re-filtering less often than our re-filtering RS; it is unclear whether, in the average case, they improve route processing enough to warrant their additional complexity. The RS described in this paper is just one component of the Routing Arbiter architecture <ref> [3] </ref> for Internet inter-domain routing. Other complementary components include an Internet-wide Routing Registry, which contains connectivity and policy information from all constituent domains. A routing registry is proving to be invaluable for debugging and analysing Internet inter-domain routing; configuring the 7 early March 1995.

Reference-contexts: Their RS implementation, therefore, has a lower route storage requirement than ours. OSPF [10], an intra-domain routing protocol, proposes the use of a Route Server for injecting inter-domain routes into a domain. Other routing protocols such as Unified <ref> [4] </ref> have proposed the use of Route Servers for computing specialized policy routes. Summary and Conclusions This paper describes an RS implementation that trades-off view re-filtering overhead for an order of magnitude reduction in route storage.

Reference-contexts: For several reasons, this latter figure is a cause for concern. First, backbone routers on the Internet already carry more than 25,000 address prefixes; the number of routed address prefixes is steadily increasing despite efforts like CIDR <ref> [5] </ref>. Second, in our experiment, each client BR advertises routes to each of the 25,000 address prefixes. While that situation is extremely unlikely, it is fairly common in today's Internet to see more than one provider advertising a route to the same address prefix at an exchange point.

Reference-contexts: Route Servers. We describe this implementation in the next section. Finally, the RS may merge the views for any two clients X and Y if their view filters are identical. 3 A Table-per-view Route Server We developed the table-per-view RS implementation in GateD <ref> [6] </ref>. In this section, we describe GateD and the table-per-view RS. We also quantify the route storage requirements of this RS. The Gate Daemon GateD is a general routing protocol development platform, portable across different hardware platforms and UNIX variants. To enhance portability, GateD abstracts machine dependencies into a core.

Reference-contexts: In star peering, each BR peers only with a Route Server. route storage in some cases (Section 3). With the continuing increase in the number of routed address prefixes in the Internet <ref> [7] </ref>, and the expected increase in exchange point sizes, this RS could become memory-limited in the future. The table-per-view RS represents just one of several (Section 5) RS implementation strategies; in general, it is possible to trade-off RS route processing for reduced route storage. <p> Section 2 describes how RSs can reduce BR storage and processing requirementsanecdotal evidence suggests that some current high-end router products are limited in the number of peering sessions they can concurrently process [9], and memory limitations of Internet backbone routers are well documented <ref> [7] </ref>. For these reasons, and because star peering can ease BR administration, peering with the RS can be cost-effective for smaller Internet service providers. Nevertheless, the RS is not a fundamental component of the inter-domain routing architecture.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it is convenient to implement RSs by modifying existing BGP implementations. This paper describes our experiences with route-processing/route-storage trade-offs in such RS implementations. Our initial RS implementation runs on a Sun SPARCserver-20 and is deployed at each of the NSF NAPs and at MAE-East. This implementation <ref> [8] </ref> maintains a separate routing table per view. In each routing table, this table-per-view RS orders routes to an address prefix by their preference in that table's view. <p> Our description informally shows a functional equivalence between star peering and mesh peering; a more formal treatment may be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Route Computation in BGP We first describe route computation in a BGP-speaking BR such as B (Figure 1). Typically, a BGP-speaking BR maintains one or more peering sessions with other BRs. Each At an exchangepoint, more than one BR could advertise a route to an address prefix. <p> Merging two or more views can result in lower RS route storage requirements. 8 However, an examination of current domain policies reveals a negligible likelihood of two views' filters being identical. There is a greater likelihood of merging sub-views <ref> [8] </ref>; if for a subset of address prefixes, the RS always computes the same routes for X and Y, it could maintain a single copy of routes to those address prefixes on behalf of X and Y. This technique can reduce RS route storage requirements for some kinds of policies.

Reference-contexts: This organization reduces route storage utilization while allowing fast insertion and deletion of routes. A number of routing protocols, including BGP version 4, and OSPF <ref> [10] </ref>, have been implemented in GateD. The GateD core is about 50,000 lines of C code (including comments); its BGP implementation is approximately half that. Implementation and Performance To implement the table-per-view RS, we modified GateD's routing table module and its BGP implementation. <p> RIPE's Route Server is also designed to compute inter-domain routing tables, on behalf of domain BRs attached to an exchange point. Their Route Server, however, computes one view on behalf of all clients. Their RS implementation, therefore, has a lower route storage requirement than ours. OSPF <ref> [10] </ref>, an intra-domain routing protocol, proposes the use of a Route Server for injecting inter-domain routes into a domain. Other routing protocols such as Unified [4] have proposed the use of Route Servers for computing specialized policy routes.

Reference-contexts: To effect inter-domain data exchange, providers interconnect at exchange points. Typically, an exchange point is a high-speed subnetworksuch as an FDDI ringto which provider border routers (BRs) attach. Examples of exchange points include the National Science Foundation's Network Access Points (NAPs <ref> [11] </ref>), MAE-East at Washington DC, the Federal Internet Exchanges and the London Internet Exchange. At some exchange points, 10-20 providers already attach; with the expected proliferation of commercial Internet service, the number of attached providers is likely to grow.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the table-per-view RS, the re-filtering RS does not require modifications to routing protocol implementations; this feature enables easier RS development for other protocols such as IDRP <ref> [12] </ref>. Performance We repeated the experiment of Figure 6 for the re-filtering RS (Figure 8 (a)). Total route processing times for the re-filtering RS are a bit smaller than for the table-per-view RS; the latter performs some redundant computation when installing a copy of a route in every view.

Reference-contexts: At some exchange points, 10-20 providers already attach; with the expected proliferation of commercial Internet service, the number of attached providers is likely to grow. Inter-domain data exchange is facilitated by inter-domain routing information exchange between provider BRs; the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) version 4 <ref> [13] </ref> is used for this purpose. BGP allows each domain to independently realize a wide variety of policies; broadly, such policies either 0 This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement NCR-9321043.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, we are considering optimizations that further reduce the view re-filtering overhead. Also under consideration is a mechanism <ref> [14] </ref> to smoothen the peaks in global route updates rates. For these reasons, we believe that the re-filtering RS is less resource-constrained than the table-per-view RS. This belief is bolstered by the relative disparity between the increases in workstation processing power and workstation memory capacity.
