Title: Minimal Recursion Semantics An Introduction  
Author: Ann Copestake, Dan Flickinger, Ivan A. Sag 
Address: Stanford, CA 94305, USA  
Affiliation: CSLI, Stanford University  
Abstract: We describe minimal recursion semantics (MRS), a framework for computational semantics which simplifies the design of algorithms. We have integrated an implementation of MRS with an HPSG grammar for both parsing and generation that enables a simple formulation of the grammatical constraints on lexical and phrasal semantics. We discuss why, in general, a semantic representation with minimal structure is desirable and illustrate how a descriptively adequate representation with a nonrecursive structure may be achieved.

Reference-contexts: The use of an underspecified intermediate representation in computational linguistics dates back at least to the LUNAR project (Woods et al., 1972) but recent work has been directed at devel oping an adequate semantics for underspecified representations, and in allowing disambiguation to be formalized as a monotonic accumulation of constraints <ref> (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) </ref>. As we discussed in x4, the simplest way to treat the model-theoretic semantics of MRS is to regard an MRS expression as a description of a set of logical forms.

Reference-contexts: For example, work acceptable rel corresponds to the sense of work in (40): (40) Does that date work for you too? 24 We do not distinguish rels purely on the basis of syntax: thus eat rel would cover both transitive and intransitive forms, the latter having an understood undergoer <ref> (see Copestake, 1996) </ref>. Some rels are not of this form, either because they express an abstraction holding for several lexical items, or because they are introduced phrasally with no lexical source.

(1996) and we will not repeat them here. <p> The reason why this approach is not just a notational variant of a standard representation is that the handles can be underspecified to represent multiple scopes (in this respect, handles are similar to labels in UDRT <ref> (Reyle 1993) </ref>). <p> believe that other approaches to the semantics of underspecified representations could also be compatible. 11 In this connection, one should also consult Esther Konig's `Underspecification Database', whose URL is: http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/sfb/b3/b3-db.html 29 Despite our description of MRS in terms of predicate calculus (with generalized quantifiers), MRS is quite close to UDRT <ref> (Reyle, 1993) </ref>, since handles play a role similar to UDRT labels. However, MRS as described here makes use of a different style of scope constraint from UDRT, as we discussed in x4.1.
