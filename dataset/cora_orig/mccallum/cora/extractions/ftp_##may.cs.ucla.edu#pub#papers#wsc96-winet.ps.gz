Abstract: tional messages are often unavoidable due to the behavior of the protocol that one tries to study. Thus, programmers must take great care to minimize the null messages that may result. One solution is to break up a single receive statement which may receive many different types of conditional messages into a sequence of receives if the arrival order of the various conditional messages is known. (c) Partitioning strategy used to decompose the network was found to affect the performance of the parallel simulator. (d) The general advice to programmers is that the simulator should be written from the beginning as a parallel program. The sequential execution should be considered as a special case. To our knowledge, this is the first parallel simulation environment that supports rapid prototyping of mobile wireless protocols. Work is in progress to parallelize the mobility model, to compare tradeoffs between conservative and optimistic run-time, and to study the behavior of the speed-up factor with respect to network load, degree of mobility and partitioning strategies.
