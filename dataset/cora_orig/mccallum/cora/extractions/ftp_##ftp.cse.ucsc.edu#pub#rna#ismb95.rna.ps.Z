Abstract: We have developed a method for predicting the common secondary structure of large RNA multiple alignments using only the information in the alignment. It uses a series of progressively more sensitive searches of the data in an iterative manner to discover regions of base pairing; the first pass examines the entire multiple alignment. The searching uses two methods to find base pairings. Mutual information is used to measure covariation between pairs of columns in the multiple alignment and a minimum length encoding method is used to detect column pairs with high potential to base pair. Dynamic programming is used to recover the optimal tree made up of the best potential base pairs and to create a stochastic context-free grammar. The information in the tree guides the next iteration of searching. The method is similar to the traditional comparative sequence analysis technique. The method correctly identifies most of the common secondary structure in 16S and 23S rRNA.

Reference-contexts: SCFGs are a generalization of HMMs and can model the base pairing interactions of RNA. Their use has been limited to short sequences due to the large amount of computation involved. The entire Comparative Sequence Analysis procedure has been implemented by Eddy and Durbin <ref> (Eddy & Durbin 1994) </ref> with good results on short sequences. They use a statistical method to measure covariation between pairs of columns in the multiple alignment and use this information to guide a process of iterative realignment of the sequences. <p> They use a statistical method to measure covariation between pairs of columns in the multiple alignment and use this information to guide a process of iterative realignment of the sequences. The complexity of their algorithm places an upper limit on its use of some 140 bases <ref> (Durbin 1994) </ref>. We are developing a similar system that will be more general and able to work on long RNA sequences (such as 16S or 23S ribosomal RNA). <p> Thus, their method has an overall time complexity of n 3 m, where n is the number of bases in the sequence. They state this places a useful upper limit of around 140 bases on their system <ref> (Durbin 1994) </ref>. 1 In a low-level SCFG, the elements would be individual bases. In a high level grammar, they could be whole helix or loop objects Our ultimate goal is to create a system that is able to create multiple alignments of similar quality but on much larger sequences.

Reference-contexts: Our own previous work employed minimum length encoding with a Dirichlet mixture prior and a Gibbs sampling methodology <ref> (Grate et al. 1994) </ref> to predict secondary structure. The best methods for multiple alignment of RNA make use of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) (Sakakibara et al. 1994; Eddy & Durbin 1994). SCFGs are a generalization of HMMs and can model the base pairing interactions of RNA. <p> Base Content Scoring Our formulation of the base content score is based on the comparison of two probabilistic models: one for the occurrence of base pairs, and the other for the occurrence of individual bases, and is the same as used in our earlier work <ref> (Grate et al. 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is a SIMD array processor with 4096 individual processing elements. Based on the serial verses parallel implementation of the HMM system, the Maspar can provide a speed up by a factor of 40 over a Sun Sparc 2 <ref> (Hughey 1993) </ref>. A parallel implementation and timing analysis of the helix finding algorithm shows that the entire 16S size first pass search takes less than 2 seconds on a limited number of sequences with no saving of search results.

Reference-contexts: Humans align RNA using an iterative technique known as Comparative Sequence Analysis, described in detail in <ref> (James, Olsen, & Pace 1989) </ref>. This technique involves iterating 2 phases, a search of the multiple alignment for new base pairing and re-aligning the data in light of the newly found base pairing. <p> These compensatory mutations (covariations) are strong evidence that the two bases interact. This forms the basis of the comparative sequence analysis technique (see <ref> (James, Olsen, & Pace 1989) </ref> for complete discussion). However, the character of helixes spans the entire range from complete conservation (no mutations discovered so far in nature) to "it doesn't matter as long as it is WC".

Reference-contexts: Reducing n The length of the E.coli 16S sequence is 1542 bases and for 23S is 2904 bases. The length of the multiple alignments for these two families are 2688 and 7977 bases respectively <ref> (Larsen et al. 1993) </ref>. Clearly these sequences are much too large to directly attack by the parsing algorithm at the individual base level. Some methods must be employed to reduce the number of items to parse on into the few hundreds before parsing will be feasible. <p> the serial implementation of the algorithms written in standard C++, running on an HP/Apollo 68040 based Unix workstation (rated about half a Sun Sparc 2). 16S Results The data set is the 60 representative sequences in the 2866 base pair long 16S multiple alignment obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project <ref> (Larsen et al. 1993) </ref>. The number of potential base paired regions is about 3.59 million. The columns of this multiple alignment were examined with the helix finding algorithm employing the 4-filter resulting in 1661 (possibly overlapping) regions. These 1661 regions were examined for covariation resulting in 35 regions. <p> However, the searching methodology does find that it is a highly likely helix, and could be included in a model that allows pseudo-knots. 23S Results The data are the 30 bacterial sequences extracted from the version 3 of the 23S alignment obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project <ref> (Larsen et al. 1993) </ref>. The same steps as used in 16S were applied to this very large, 7977 column alignment. The first pass search using the 4-filter results in 8205 potentially base paired regions, of which only 72 pass the covariation analysis.

Reference-contexts: The experiments on 16S and 23S have indicated that only 3 passes are necessary for even these large alignments. Parallel Computation All these algorithms can be parallelized. We have implemented many of them on our Maspar MP-2204 <ref> (Nickolls 1990) </ref>. It is a SIMD array processor with 4096 individual processing elements. Based on the serial verses parallel implementation of the HMM system, the Maspar can provide a speed up by a factor of 40 over a Sun Sparc 2 (Hughey 1993).

Reference-contexts: We are developing more sensitive tests on column pairs to determine if they are base paired. This would improve detection of lone base pairs and provide better sets of potential helixes for further analysis. We are experimenting with a neural net approach <ref> (Reklaw, Hanna, & Haussler 1995) </ref> to combine the mutual information and base pair composition of column pairs to discover and rank potential helixes. The 37 inputs are the counts of each of the 36 possible pairs (in our 6 letter alphabet) and the mutual information covariation.

Reference-contexts: We then describe our methods of detecting possible base pairs and the secondary structure searching methodology that will form the core of the iterative multiple alignment system under development. At present only the search of a fixed multiple alignment and prediction of secondary structure via a stochastic context-free grammar <ref> (Sakakibara et al. 1994) </ref> is functional. Results on 16S and 23S rRNA are presented. Multiple Alignments and SCFGs The standard methods of describing RNA secondary structure are a multiple alignment, Figure 1A, and a secondary structure picture, Figure 1B . <p> However, the tree structure and the parameters are chosen such that only sequences that match it well have high probability, non-matching sequences have an extremely small probability. It is this flexibility that gives the power to handle variant RNA structures (see <ref> (Sakakibara et al. 1994) </ref> for complete discussion). SCFGs are inherently hierarchical. A full, low-level SCFG will specify details down to the individual base or base pair level. A higher level view abstracts the individual bases into the logical structures of helix and loop. <p> A positive value indicates that the pairing is a better model, and the larger the value the better. From <ref> (Sakakibara et al. 1994) </ref>. from the data in Figure 5. <p> Score Data Our data for the probabilities, PrPair and PrSingle, is based on a previous study of 16S rRNA <ref> (Sakakibara et al. 1994) </ref> and our own studies, and is shown in Figure 5. The derived scores used are given in Figure 6. Here we also add in the letter N for any base that is not exactly known, and -, used for spacing in the multiple alignment.

Reference-contexts: These 1661 regions were examined for covariation resulting in 35 regions. These 35 regions are processed into 200 points. The resulting tree contains 20 helixes, all of which are known in the E.coli secondary structure, are indicated in the XRNA <ref> (Weiser, Gutell, & Noller 1994) </ref> drawing, Figure 7. Even at this early stage, the SCFG output contains 20 helixes, 41 loops, and 40 branches, and is too large to include in this paper. The total execution time is 10 minutes of real time.
