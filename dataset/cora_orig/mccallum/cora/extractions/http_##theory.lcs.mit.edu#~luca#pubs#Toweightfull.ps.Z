Abstract: We investigate the approximability properties of several weighted problems, by comparing them with the respective unweighted problems. For an appropriate (and very general) definition of niceness, we show that if a nice weighted problem is hard to approximate within r, then its polynomially bounded weighted version is hard to approximate within r o(1). Then we turn our attention to specific problems, and we show that the unweighted versions of Min Vertex Cover, Min Sat, Max Cut, Max DiCut, Max 2Sat, and Max Exact kSat are exactly as hard to approximate as their weighted versions. We note in passing that Min Vertex Cover is exactly as hard to approximate as Min Sat. In order to prove the reductions for Max 2Sat, Max Cut, Max DiCut, and Max E3Sat we introduce the new notion of "mixing" set and we give an explicit construction of such sets. These reductions give new non-approximability results for these problems.

Reference-contexts: Since the first proof of the PCP-theorem, several other refined proofs of the same result appeared in the literature in order to improve the performance of the verifier with respect to different query complexity parameters <ref> [6, 15, 7, 5, 21, 22, 23] </ref>.

For most of these problems, however, the lower bounds hold for their weighted version only. <p> C ! can be transformed into a solution C 0 for (G; !) of measure jC ! j c. 7 The following two lemmas can be proved by using arguments similar to the reduction between Max Clique and zero-free bit PCP given in <ref> [5] </ref> and the reduction between zero-free bit PCP and Max Clique implicitly given in [14], respectively. 1 They have been independently proved in [29]. Lemma 7 Min Vertex Cover 1 AP Min Sat. Proof: Let G = (V; E) be a graph. <p> Remark 16 A similar argument can be applied to Max DiCut thus showing that Max Weight DiCut ff AP Max DiCut, for any ff &gt; 1. From the results of <ref> [5, 32, 23] </ref> we have that, for any fl &gt; 0 it is NP-hard to approximate Max Weight Cut (resp. Max DiCut) within 17=16 fl (resp. 13=12 fl). From the previous theorem we can extend these results to the unweighted versions. <p> From the previous theorem we can extend these results to the unweighted versions. Corollary 17 For any fl &gt; 0, Max Cut is not (17=16 fl)-approximable and Max DiCut is not (13=12 fl)-approximable unless P = NP. This improves over the non-approximability result by Bellare, Goldreich and Sudan (see <ref> [5] </ref>, page 57). 11 5 Constraint Satisfaction Problems In order to deal with various versions of the Max Sat problem we have to introduce the notion of mixing set of tuples. <p> The following non-approximability results are proved in <ref> [5, 32, 23] </ref>. Theorem 23 The following holds for any fl &gt; 0 (unless P = NP): * Max Weight E2Sat is not (22=21 fl)-approximable; * Max Weight E3Sat is not (8=7 fl)-approximable; * Max Weight 2CSP is not (10=9 fl)-approximable.
