Abstract: Technical Report TIRM 89-934, Turing Institute, UK, (Jan 1989), http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pclark/papers/tirm34.ps Abstract This paper describes a prototype system for the prediction of parameters associated with a geological prospect, required for assessing the likelihood of hydrocarbons at the prospect. A principle characteristic of expert reasoning in this domain involves the recall and use of previous examples (`exemplars') of similar, already-drilled wells in addition to the use of general rules concerning known parameters of the prospect. Such reasoning is a common feature of human problem-solving, and involves generation and use of generalisations at run-time when a performance task is known, in contrast to an exhaustive enumeration of generalisations from examples before the performance task is known as performed by many rule induction systems. In this paper we describe the mechanisms for such exemplar-based reasoning in the prototype system, and discuss the characteristics of the problem domain which suggest the appropriateness of this approach.

Reference-contexts: This is an important feature, and distinguishes this system from other exemplar-based systems which simply pass characteristics from the most similar exemplar to a new instance unchanged (eg. <ref> [1] </ref>, [7]). Instead, our approach 6 can be viewed as an application of the `prototype plus deformation' technique, as used in the Taxman-II system [9]. The appropriate transformation to use is determined by the theory which is selected to explain the data at wells relevant to the new prospect.

Reference-contexts: The particular parameter values we have focused on have been the reservoir thickness and porosity at the prospect site. Finally, expert systems have also been applied to the lowest level of interpretation, working directly with the well logs and seismic sections. Examples are the systems Litho <ref> [2] </ref> and Dipmeter Advisor [5]. These systems include pattern recognition modules which interpret the well log plots directly, and produce output about the stratigraphic features at the wells.

Reference-contexts: Should the plot not fit well, other plots (eg. log plots) might be tried. Wells which are poorly fitting may suggest to the expert to search for an explanation for the discrepancy, and hence may have their relevances changed. Note that inductive tools such as ID3 [11] or CN2 <ref> [3] </ref> are not appropriate to our problem of forming a general theory from examples because we are predicting a numeric value rather than membership of a class, we are working with few (&lt;10, usually) examples and we wish to give different weights to the examples.

Reference-contexts: One advantage of this approach is that the system is able to offer an explanation of its conclusions, and it facilitates easy correction and updating of the rule-base should the user disagree. A simple `learning apprentice' module, modelled loosely on the Teiresias rule acquisition system <ref> [4] </ref>, has been added to allow the user a dialog with the system to examine its reasoning, and correct it should he or she disagree. 4.2.2 Exemplar Transformation and the Formation of Theories Forming a geologically plausible theory to explain the data observed at nearby wells is a skilled task, involving

Reference-contexts: Extensional theories, however, advocate that a concept be represented by the set (or a subset) of examples (`exemplars') of it plus a mechanism for generalising from those specific cases to new cases as they arise. In many expert system applications such as medical diagnosis <ref> [14] </ref>, conclusions about a patient (say) are reached by using general rules to reason about the known symptoms of the patient, without reference to other previously diagnosed patients who may have had similar symptoms (though whether medical experts themselves reason solely in this general way is a question for debate).

Reference-contexts: Other systems have addressed the intermediate level of the prospect appraisal task shown in figure 1, namely that of calculating basic parameters required to assess a prospect, but assume that the low level interpretation of well logs and seismic sections has already been performed. For example, the system Mendel <ref> [15] </ref> assesses the probability of different rock formations being present, and the system Denvad [16] assesses the paeleo-depositional environment of a given rock formation, both taking as input interpreted well log data. This intermediate level is the level which the prototype system described here addresses.
