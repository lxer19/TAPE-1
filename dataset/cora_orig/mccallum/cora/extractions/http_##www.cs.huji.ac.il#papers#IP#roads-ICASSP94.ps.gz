Abstract: Dynamic Programming is one of the main methods of line detection. It defines a cost, which depends on local information, and performs a summation-minimization process in a graph or in the image. In particular, Fischler et al presented an algorithm, called F*, which achieves important results (convergence, robustness, rapidity). In previous works, we proposed a mathematical formalization of the F*, which allowed us to extend the cost to cliques of more than two points to take into account the contrast, and to include curvature information in the cost by using neighborhoods of size larger than one. In the present paper, we propose a method for computing this cost automatically for a wide range of images, from the probability distribution in the neighborhood of sample segments. We apply the resulting potentials on SPOT images.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Among the various algorithms of line detection, those based on dynamic programming have raised great interest for their rapidity, robustness to noise and precision ([1],[2],[3], <ref> [4] </ref>). The basic approach consists of defining a cost or potential depending on the local characteristics (contrast, grey-level) of the image and of performing an iterative summation- minimization process in a graph or in the image.

We have shown in previous works ([5], <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]) how one of the main algorithms of dynamic programming, the F* of Fischler et al [2], could be generalized to cliques of more than two points and to neighborhoods of size larger than one, in order to take into account grey level, contrast, and curvature in one unique cost <p> Thus there were only 24 cliques to be considered : each point has eight direct neighbors, and only three second order neighbors could come afterwards without forming together an angle of less than +/- 135 degrees <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.1. Computation of the distance function We define two types of images : * Im1 is a series of 8 output images corresponding to the 8 neighbors of a point. At the beginning, they are equal to zero for starting points (S 0 ), to +1 for other points. <p> Details about optimization and proof of convergence of the both algorithms may be found in <ref> [6] </ref> and [7]. 3.2. Algorithm of pattern recognition The algorithm of back-propagation is based on the directional information of Im1 (See 3.1) : we follow the direction shown by the successive cliques.
