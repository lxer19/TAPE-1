Title: Evolution as a design strategy for nonlinear architecture Generative modeling of 3-D surfaces

Abstract: We discuss the dialogue between Architecture and Artificial Life. It takes place on the level of architectural reflection, process and tool development. We describe our investigative software, GGE Generative Genetic Explorer, in which genetic operations interact with AutoCAD to generate novel forms for the architect. GGE allows us to comment on design issues concerning computer aided design tools based on evolutionary algorithms.

Reference-contexts: From the architect's point of view, the line segments constitute a skeleton over which "skin" (or a polygonal "face" or surface) will be stretched. She then saves the profile set to a file with an Au-toCAD command written for GGE. GGE is actually implemented in LISP <ref> (Guy Steele 1990) </ref>. The architect moves to the GGE window 4 and informs it that this file constitutes the initial form for a genotype. Transformation sequence: The remainder of the genotype is a sequence of transformations. To create the phenotype these are applied to the initial form in succession.

Reference-contexts: There were slight difficulties with the architect tracking the actual transformation (i.e. what happened, to what, given the current form). We think one way to improve tracking is to provide labelling for a form's profiles and vertices in Auto CAD. Genotype coding: Following the genetic programming (GP) style <ref> (Koza 1992) </ref>, GGE does not encode the transformation sequence of the genotype into binary. A transformation is like a GP primitive (i.e. statement in a GP program). In contrast to GP, however, a transformation sequence is not encoded a tree structure for the purpose of crossover.
