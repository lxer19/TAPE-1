Abstract: A novel bandwidth regulation mechanism is proposed which improves the ability of a packet-switching network to cope with multiple real-time and non-real-time traffic classes. The mechanism achieves regulation of link bandwidth at two levels. At the first level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between different traffic classes. The concept of `inter-class regulation' is introduced which enforces that the bandwidth left unused by a traffic class is divided among traffic classes with high bandwidth demands. At the second level, bandwidth regulation is enforced on end-to-end traffic streams, so-called flows, such that flows from the same class with identical routes have the same throughput constraints. This concept is referred to as `intra-class regulation'. A simple distributed protocol is presented that achieves intra-class and inter-class regulation in a general inter-network. The effectiveness of the protocol is demonstrated by simulation experiments.

A disadvantage of these methods is that they control usage of bandwidth exclusively by dropping packets. A different type of bandwidth control regulates the traffic rate at the flow sources [6, 8, 13].

Reference-contexts: Hence, the network is no longer generally accessible to every user at all times. Resource Regulation without Admission Control: This approach attempts to improve the network's ability to cope with the requirements of real-time applications, but maintains the notion of the network as a shared resource <ref> [5, 8, 12] </ref>. In general, resource regulation schemes do not dedicate resources to individual flows and do not provide admission control. Rather, the network enforces policies to distribute available resources to the flows. As a result, the resources available to a flow decreases if the number of flows increases. <p> A number of studies on link sharing considers bandwidth regulation of traffic classes without providing mechanisms that regulate the bandwidth consumption of flows from the same class. Link sharing approaches provide some notion of inter-class regulation, but typically do not address bandwidth regulation of flows from the same class <ref> [5, 11, 12] </ref>. So far, no regulation mechanism has been proposed that, at the same time, regulates bandwidth for individual flows and for traffic classes in a general network. <p> Indeed, inter-class and intra-class regulation are two independent concepts. One can easily imagine bandwidth allocations that provide inter-class regulation but do not offer intra-class regulation, and vice versa. In particular, all proposals for hierarchical link sharing <ref> [5, 11, 12] </ref> provide some regulation for traffic classes (different from the presented inter-class regulation), but do not solve the regulation problem for flows from the same class. <p> On the other hand, the surplus value at a link in (2) is dependent on the values of the shares in (1). Results similar to Theorem 1 can be developed for different bandwidth regulation definitions, in particular, for hierarchical link sharing schemes <ref> [5, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The simulation was implemented using the REAL (version 4.0) network simulator <ref> [9] </ref>. We modified the source code of REAL to include our protocol. For the simulations, we make the following assumptions. Packet sizes are constant for all flows and set to 1250 bytes. Propagation delays are small and set to 10s.

Reference-contexts: However, such an allocation results in a waste of link bandwidth. In Lemma 1 we state that by selecting l as large as possible, one can make the entire link bandwidth available for transmission. The proof of Lemma 1 is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> In Lemma 2, proven in <ref> [10] </ref>, we give the condition that must hold if the shares in a network with multiple traffic classes are maximal. <p> Therefore, one is interested in finding bandwidth allocations which offer inter-class regulation with maximal surplus values and intra-class regulation with maximal shares. In Theorem 1 we state that such a bandwidth allocation can be effectively constructed for general networks. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 1 Given a network and a set of flows with offered loads f i j i 2 Fg, there exists a bandwidth allocation that provides intra-class regulation with maximal shares ff fl p (l) and inter-class regulation with max imal surplus values fl l . <p> For the sake of a clear presentation we make some simplifying assumptions for the network and the protocol. For example, we assume that information on the offered load of a flow is available at its source. Also, the protocol does not address reliability issues. In <ref> [10] </ref> we discuss how these assumptions can be relaxed. 3.1 Design Concepts The protocol mechanisms presented here are intended as extensions to an existing network layer protocol.

Reference-contexts: Each flow belongs to one traffic class, and the assignment of flows to traffic classes is based on the application type, the protocol used, or the location of the traffic source <ref> [11] </ref>. two host systems is called a flow. We address the problem of regulating the use of link bandwidth in an internetwork such as the one in Figure 1 without relying on admission control functions. In todays internetworks, link bandwidth is the scarcest resource. <p> A number of studies on link sharing considers bandwidth regulation of traffic classes without providing mechanisms that regulate the bandwidth consumption of flows from the same class.
