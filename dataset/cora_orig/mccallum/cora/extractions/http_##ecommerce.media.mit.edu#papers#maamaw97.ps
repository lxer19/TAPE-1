Abstract: Results from a Multi-Agent Abstract The potential for electronic commerce involving the buying and selling of goods, financial vehicles, and services on the Internet has not yet been fully realized. Although an increasing number of vendors and financial institutions maintain Web sites providing a convenient way for consumers to shop, these sites have not radically changed the shopping experience. Often, these Web sites are little more than online versions of product catalogs with search capabilities. Kasbah [Chavez96] is a multi-agent electronic marketplace that proposes to transform the online shopping experience by leveraging the unique features of the Internet and software agent technologies. This paper reports on the results of a multi-agent electronic marketplace experiment involving about two hundred participants using a slightly modified version of Kasbah. This experiment was conducted at MIT's

Reference-contexts: The field of speech acts has investigated such theoretical issues in depth [Winograd86]. Finally, if marketplaces are to be distributed, agents may need to be mobile in order to negotiate at the different sites. IBM has created an Aglets Workbench for creating mobile Java applets <ref> [Aglets96] </ref> and General Magic has developed a Telescript language and explores several pertinent marketplace scenarios in their white paper [Telescript96]. As discussed in the previous section, we are now exploring the potential of distributed marketplaces and mobile commerce agents. 7.

Reference-contexts: We anticipate that our agent marketplace combined with sophisticated agent strategies will offer a more compelling consumer experience over todays online auctions and marketplaces. 6.

However, none of these sites use autonomous agents to negotiate on behalf of their owners. The closest system to ours we are aware of is MAGMA [Tsvetovatyy96], although there are significant differences.

Autonomous and intelligent agents have been actively researched for many years. The predominant goal of this work is to help people manage information and work overload [Maes95] <ref> [Bradshaw97] </ref>. Early work in Distributed AI, focused on multi-agent collaboration to help solve global problems [Demazeau90]. Decentralized AI shifted this focus slightly to the interactions among agents with different motivations. The underlying concept, however, was still to further some organizational goals [Demazeau90].

Reference-contexts: Chavez and Maes have proposed Kasbah as an electronic marketplace architecture where buying and selling agents negotiate and make deals on behalf of their users <ref> [Chavez96] </ref>. While not addressing all issues involved in electronic commerce, Kasbah makes headway in redefining the marketplace by leveraging the increasing ubiquitousness of the Internet and software agent technologies. <p> To test the viability of a multi-agent electronic marketplace, an experiment was conducted at the Media Laboratory in October 1996 using a slightly modified version of Kasbah <ref> [Chavez96] </ref> [Chavez97b]. Robert H. Guttman Pattie Maes Anthony Chavez Daniel Dreilinger Specifically, about two hundred attendees from industry bought and sold goods by creating buying and selling agents respectively at specialized kiosks in a one-day, six-hour experiment. <p> The Marketplace The kiosk front-end described above communicates with the marketplace back-end (written in Java) via TCP/IP sockets and an established higher-level protocol. While there are many facets to the marketplace as discussed in <ref> [Chavez96] </ref>, we will focus here on the agents and how they interact. When an agent is created at a kiosk, its parameters are transmitted to the back-end and an agent object is instantiated and added to the marketplace's active agent list.

Reference-contexts: Modeling optimization problems as multi-agent marketplace systems has been shown to be an effective technique. Examples of such systems include Challenger, a system for allocating processing resources within a network of workstations <ref> [Chavez97a] </ref>, and Michael Wellman's WALRAS, an algorithm used to calculate competitive equilibria where agents submit single-good demand functions to market-clearing auctions [Mullen96]. Our multi-agent electronic marketplace is similar to these market-based systems in that it attempts to efficiently and optimally match buyers and sellers.

The Architecture There are many elements to the multi-agent electronic marketplace scenario above as described in <ref> [Chavez97b] </ref>. The two key components, however, are the kiosk front-end and the marketplace back-end. We will briefly describe these now. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: The underlying concept, however, was still to further some organizational goals [Demazeau90]. Agent cooperation is also seen in today's Web-based systems such as Firefly [Shardanand95], where agents cooperate and exchange information to recommend music to their owners. There has also been substantial research and analysis of market-based systems <ref> [Clearwater96] </ref> [Rosenschein94]. The typical approach is to model an optimization problem (e.g., resource allocation) as a marketplace consisting of multiple agents, each trying to maximize its own utility. This differs from the traditional AI approach mentioned above in that agents are now competing instead of cooperating.

Reference-contexts: goods) continuously enter and leave the marketplace buyers continuously enter and leave the marketplace sales occur whenever the buyers price is greater than or equal to the sellers price Strategic analysis of this type of auction is lacking in the economics and game theory literature relative to other auction types <ref> [Friedman93] </ref>. Our future research will explore potential strategies for this market model, including how dependencies among auctions influence them. This will help us create more sophisticated buying and selling strategies than the simple (but effective) ones used in this experiment.

Reference-contexts: These will be used for defining goods that agents have not yet traded. We are also exploring protocols and semantics for defining more extensible agent marketplace communications and are researching several alternative protocols <ref> [Labrou94] </ref> [Telescript96]. The chosen protocol will be used to support the distribution of agents so they can either execute on the marketplace server or on a users local machine. This marketplace protocol will be open to allow third-party agents (with their own unique strategies) to participate in the agent marketplace. <p> A multi-agent system implies agent communication. This is also an area which has been extensively researched. KQML is perhaps the most notable attempt to design a general-purpose agent language <ref> [Labrou94] </ref>. We chose not to use KQML, since our agents are all locally built and thus can be made to communicate via a predefined set of methods. We are currently working on more sophisticated agents which may require a richer semantics of communication to enable more complex and subtle negotiations.

Reference-contexts: Although the concept of our agent marketplace model is a continuous double auction, the implementation of our agent marketplace had elements of continuous English auctions and continuous Dutch auctions <ref> [Milgrom89] </ref>. Buyers continually raising their prices over time is consistent with the protocol of English (first-price, open-cry) auctions and sellers continually lowering their prices over time is consistent with the protocol of Dutch (first-price, sealed-bid) auctions.
