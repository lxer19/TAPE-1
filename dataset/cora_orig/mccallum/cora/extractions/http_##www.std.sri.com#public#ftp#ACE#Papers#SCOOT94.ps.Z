Abstract: This paper describes a Synchronous Collaborative ObjectOriented Toolkit (SCOOT) used to build collaboration-aware applications within a preexisting general-purpose, real-time synchronous collaboration environment, Collaborative Environment for Concurrent Engineering Design 1 (CECED) [CRAI93].

Reference-contexts: Although SCOOT also handles binary large objects, by definition, it cannot automatically accommodate the application and architecture 4 This is similar to how wellstructured Apple Event-aware Macintosh applications are designed <ref> [APPL91] </ref>. specific translation of these objects in a heterogeneous environment. 5. Comparison With Other Collaboration Toolkits Existing collaboration toolkits may be separated into one of three categories, based on their design approach: domainspecific toolkits, user-interface-based toolkits, and general-purpose toolkits.

Reference-contexts: The most equitable comparison for SCOOT is with general-purpose collaborative toolkits, which include Conference Toolkit <ref> [BONF91] </ref>, GroupKit V2 [ROSE92], Rendezvous [HILL93], and LIZA [GIBB91]. The primary difference between SCOOT and these toolkits is that SCOOT is designed to support a replicated application model, while the others presuppose a centralized application model.
