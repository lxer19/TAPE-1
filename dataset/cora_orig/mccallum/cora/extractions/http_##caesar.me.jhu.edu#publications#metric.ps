Title: A Useful Metric For Modular Robot Motion Planning

Abstract: In this paper we examine the problem of dynamic self-reconfiguration of a class of modular robotic systems referred to as metamorphic systems. A metamorphic robotic system is a collection of mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. We define a concept of distance between metamorphic robot configurations which satisfies the formal properties of a metric. This metric, called the configuration metric is then applied to the automatic self-reconfiguration of metamorphic systems from any initial to any final specified configuration. The technique of Simulated Annealing is used to drive the re-configuration process with the configuration metric as the cost function. The relative performance of simulated annealing with this cost function is shown to be superior then simulated annealing using other cost functions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A metamorphic robotic system <ref> [Ch94] </ref> is a collection of independently controlled mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. Each module allows power and information to flow through itself and to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to observe that a pure greedy approach will get stuck in local minima and would not yield a good solution. 6.1 Simulated Annealing Simulated Annealing is an algorithmic approach to solving optimization problems especially in cases where the global extremum is hidden among several local extrema <ref> [KiGV83] </ref>. The basic idea behind this algorithm comes from an analogy with simulating the annealing of solids [MeRRTT53] and slow cooling of liquids, i.e. the way metals or crystals cool and anneal to achieve the minimum energy state.

Reference-contexts: In cases where there is substantial overlap, this can save a lot of computational effort. The proof of these properties is given in <ref> [PECh95] </ref>. 4 5 Complexity of the Motion Planning Problem As described in section 2:2, the motion planning problem of metamorphic robots is defined as the reconfiguration of a collection of modules from an initial configuration to a final configuration based on certain constraints.
