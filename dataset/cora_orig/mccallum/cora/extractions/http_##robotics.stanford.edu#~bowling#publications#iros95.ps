Abstract: The study of the acceleration properties at the end effector is important in the analysis, design, and control of robot manipulators. In previous efforts aimed at addressing this problem, the end-effector acceleration has been treated as a vector combining both the linear and angular accelerations. The methodology presented in this article provides characterizations of these two different types of accelerations and describes the relationship between them. This work is an extension of our previous studies on manipulator inertial and acceleration properties. The treatment relies on the ellipsoid expansion model, a simple geometric approach to efficiently analyze end-effector accelerations. Results of the application of this analysis to the PUMA 560 manipulator are discussed.

Reference-contexts: When determining this measure for systems with many degree of freedom (DOF) it is necessary to account for linear as well as angular accelerations. The non-homogeneity between linear and angular accelerations has been often ignored and these two quantities have been treated as component of a single vector. Yoshikawa <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the Dynamic Manipulability Ellipsoid (DME). Here linear and angular acceler ations are analyzed as components of a single vector. Scaling factors are used to bring the differing magnitudes into range with each other.

Reference-contexts: In practice these scaling factors are difficult to determine for many DOF systems and their selection is somewhat arbitrary. In addition, the method yields a conservative estimate of the isotropic acceleration. In an earlier study, we have proposed <ref> [2] </ref> the hyper-parallelepiped of acceleration as a description of end-effector accelerations. The exact isotropic acceleration can be found by inscribing a hyper-sphere within the acceleration hyper-parallelepiped. However, this process proves difficult when analyzing systems with many DOF.

Reference-contexts: The motor torque bounds are found by subtracting the breakaway torques from the maximum torques as given in <ref> [3] </ref>; t bound = f1:45; 1:70; 1:62; 0:30; 0:27; 0:26gN m: Figures 10 through 13 show the results of analysis of the PUMA 560 for different manipulator parameters. For all cases the weighting matrix, W , is identity.
