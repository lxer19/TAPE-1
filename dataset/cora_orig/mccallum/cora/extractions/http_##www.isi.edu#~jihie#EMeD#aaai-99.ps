Abstract: Successful approaches to developing knowledge acquisition tools use expectationsof what the user has to add or may want to add, based on how new knowledge fits within a knowledge base that already exists. When a knowledge base is first created or undergoes significant extensions and changes, these tools cannot provide much support. This paper presents an approach to creating expectations when a new knowledge base is built, and describes a knowledge acquisition tool that we implemented using this approach that supports users in creating problem-solving knowledge. As the knowledge base grows, the knowledge acquisition tool derives more frequent and more reliable expectations that result from enforcing constraints in the knowledge representation system, looking for missing pieces of knowledge in the knowledge base, and working out incrementally the inter-dependencies among the different components of the knowledge base. Our preliminary evaluations show a thirty percent time savings during knowledge acquisition. Moreover, by providing tools to support the initial phases of knowledge base development many mistakes are detected early on and even avoided altogether. We believe that our approach contributes to improving the quality of the knowledge acquisition process and of the resulting knowledge-based systems as well.

Reference-contexts: Without EMeD, the subjects run the problem solver to detect errors, and ended up spending more time to find the sources of errors and fix them. Related Work There are other KA tools that take advantage of relationships among KB elements to derive expectations. Tere-sias <ref> (Davis 1979) </ref> uses rule models to capture relationships among the rules based on their general structure and guide the user in following that general structure when a new rule is added that fits a model.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, EMeD is unique because it guides users in adding new problem-solving methods. In the field of software engineering, it has been recognized that it is generally better to focus on improving the process of software development process rather than on the output program itself <ref> (Dunn 1994) </ref>. Our approach embraces this view and tries to improve the initial phases of KB development. Some previous work on using formal languages to specify knowledge bases (Fensel, Angele, & Studer 1998) is inspired by software engineering approaches.

Reference-contexts: Most of these expectations are derived from the inter-dependencies among the components in a knowledge-base system. EXPECT (Gil & Melz 1996; Swartout & Gil 1995) and ProtegeII <ref> (Eriksson et al. 1995) </ref> use dependencies between factual knowledge and problem-solving methods to find related pieces of knowledge in their KB systems and create expectations from them.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Knowledge acquisition is recognized as an important research area for making knowledge-based AI succeed in practice <ref> (Feigenbaum 1993) </ref>. An approach that has been very effective to develop tools that acquire knowledge from users is to use expectations of what users have to add or may want to add next. Most of these expectations are derived from the inter-dependencies among the components in a knowledge-base system.

Reference-contexts: Our approach embraces this view and tries to improve the initial phases of KB development. Some previous work on using formal languages to specify knowledge bases <ref> (Fensel, Angele, & Studer 1998) </ref> is inspired by software engineering approaches. This work provides a framework for users to model and capture the initial requirements of the system, and require that users are experienced with formal logic.

Reference-contexts: EMeD: Expect Method Developer We have concentrated our initial effort in developing a KA tool that uses these kinds of expectations to support users to develop problem solving methods. We built a KA tool called EMeD (EXPECT Method Developer) for the EXPECT framework for knowledge-based system <ref> (Swartout & Gil 1995) </ref>. An EXPECT knowledge base is composed of factual knowledge problem-solving knowledge. The factual knowledge includes concepts, relations, and concepts in Loom (Macgregor 1990), a knowledge representation system of KL-one family.
