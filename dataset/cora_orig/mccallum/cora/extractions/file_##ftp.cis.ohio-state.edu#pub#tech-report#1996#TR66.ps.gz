Title: Time Constrained Bandwidth Smoothing for Interactive Video-On-Demand Systems

Abstract: The use of a client-side buffer in the delivery of compressed prerecorded video can be effective tool for removing the burstiness required of the underlying server and network by smoothing the bandwidth requirements for continuous delivery. Given a fixed-size smoothing buffer, several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced in the literature that are provably optimal under certain constraints, typically requiring large buffer residency times to realize their optimal properties. The large buffer residency times, however, make providing VCR functions harder to support. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms that, in addition to the size of the client side buffer, use a time constraint as a parameter in the bandwidth plan creation, making the plans more amenable to supporting VCR interactivity. Our results show that the buffer residency times can be reduced, while still allowing the bandwidth allocation to be smoothed for continuous video delivery.

Reference-contexts: Due to the undeterministic nature of the interactions, providing guaranteed VCR interactivity can be difficult while maintaining a high network utilization. To aid in VCR functionality, ideas such as contingency channels can be useful <ref> [4] </ref>, where excess channel capacity is allocated for temporary allocation to VCR functionality. In addition, using a bandwidth algorithm that minimizes both the rate-constraint and buffer residency times can be useful by reducing the amount of data required on a resynchronization [14]. 3.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the critical bandwidth allocation (CBA) algorithm creates a convex hull around F under resulting in a plan that has monotonically decreasing bandwidth requirements for the continuous uninterrupted playback of the video <ref> [7] </ref>. Using a CBA algorithm has several advantages. First, the buffer requirement is smaller than or equal to any single constant bandwidth allocation plan. Second, the plan bandwidth requirements are monotonically decreasing, making admission control simpler. <p> Based on this framework, several algorithms have been developed in order to traverse down the river defined by F under and F over .

Reference-contexts: Quasi-Interactive Playback In the quasi-interactive playback mode, the user is allowed to have limited VCR interactions. In this mode, a method called the VCR window can be used to allow users limited access to their videos <ref> [11] </ref>. This is based upon the observation that the common VCR functions rewind, examine, stop, and pause can be handled by the client-side buffer without requiring additional bandwidth from the network and server to service.

Reference-contexts: The three algorithms then select different starting points along the frontier for the next run. Depending on the chosen starting point, the algorithms will exhibit different properties. A more in-depth discussion of the pre-1997 algorithms can be found in an upcoming comparison paper <ref> [13] </ref>. Sample bandwidth allocation plans for these three algorithms (along with their buffer residency requirements) can be found in Figure 4. One important trait that these algorithms exhibit is that with small amounts of buffering significant reductions in the burstiness of the video delivery are possible.

Reference-contexts: While minimizing the peak band-width requirement, these river-charting algorithms may also minimize the number of rate increases [8], minimize the total number of rate changes [9, 10], minimize the variability of bandwidth requirements [26], or minimize the buffer residency times <ref> [14] </ref>. The first three techniques typically require large buffer residency times to achieve their optimal properties. As an example, using the minimum changes bandwidth smoothing algorithm and a 10 megabyte smoothing buffer results in buffer residency times on the order of half a minute (or more). <p> Based on this framework, several algorithms have been developed in order to traverse down the river defined by F under and F over . Most algorithms minimize the peak bandwidth requirement given the fixed client-side buffer <ref> [7, 8, 10, 14, 26] </ref>. <p> As an alternative to the previous three algorithms, a bandwidth smoothing algorithm can strive to minimize the buffer residency times. The rate-constrained bandwidth smoothing (RCBS), given a maximum rate-constraint, minimizes the total amount of buffer required while minimizing the buffer residency times <ref> [14] </ref>. The RCBS algorithm examines all the frames within the movie and prefetches any of the frames that would have otherwise violated the rate constraint. As a result, the RCBS algorithm only smooths the bandwidth requirements when the rate constraint would have been violated. <p> In addition, using a bandwidth algorithm that minimizes both the rate-constraint and buffer residency times can be useful by reducing the amount of data required on a resynchronization <ref> [14] </ref>. 3.
