Reference-contexts: This manual assumes background information about MaRS User's Manual <ref> [Alaettinoglu et al., 1991] </ref>, computer networks [Tanenbaum, 1988], X Window System [Jones, 1989], and Unix [Ritchie, 1984]. It is assumed that the source code of MaRS is available for reference. The rest of the manual is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the structure of the MaRS directory. <p> All the components mentioned above are implemented in MaRS Version 1.0. They are described in more detail in <ref> [Alaettinoglu et al., 1991] </ref>. If these components are inadequate for some purpose, the user can define new components. Section 8 explains how to program a new routing or workload source/sink component. <p> CLASS FTP SOURCE Application Transport Class FTP SINK TELNET SOURCE TELNET SINK SMPLTRFC SOURCE Simple Poisson/Uniform Traffic Source SMPLTRFC SINK Simple Poisson/Uniform Traffic Sink AUXILIARY CLASS PERF MONITOR STOPPER LCOSTFCN Link Cost Function OTHER CLASS None A detailed functional description of the components implemented is in the MaRS user's manual <ref> [Alaettinoglu et al., 1991] </ref>. From now on, we will refer to the address of the data space of a component instance as its id. 3.1 Data Structure Each component instance have its own data space. <p> If the ModifyMask is set in the p flags variable, the simulator will display the default value associated with the parameter. The simulator will not ask for a value, but the user can change the value using the X window interface <ref> [Alaettinoglu et al., 1991] </ref>. Meter display If the CanHaveMeterMask flag is set, a parameter can be displayed in a graphic "meter". The routine pointed to by p calc val is called to produce a value to be displayed in a meter.

Acknowledgment We gratefully acknowledge the use of some of the event handling and graphic interface routines of the MIT Network Simulator <ref> [Heybey, 1989] </ref>. Also, the user and programmer manuals of the MIT Network Simulator helped us in writing manuals for MaRS. 2 MaRS Directory Structure The MaRS directory contains subdirectories for the source code, object libraries, manuals, executables, and some post-processing scripts.
