Title: On Data Structures and Asymmetric Communication Complexity  
Author: Peter Bro Miltersen Noam Nisan Shmuel Safra Avi Wigderson 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two party communication complexity when the input sizes of the two players differ significantly, the "asymmetric" case. Most of previous work on communication complexity only considers the total number of bits sent, but we study tradeoffs between the number of bits the first player sends and the number of bits the second sends. These types of questions are closely related to the complexity of static data structure problems in the cell probe model. We derive two generally applicable methods of proving lower bounds, and obtain several applications. These applications include new lower bounds for data structures in the cell probe model. Of particular interest is our "round elimination" lemma, which is interesting also for the usual symmetric communication case. This lemma generalizes and abstracts in a very clean form the "round reduction" techniques used in many previous lower bound proofs.

Reference-contexts: For all a log l, a randomized one sided error [O (a); O (l=2 a )]-protocol. Proof: Deterministic Protocol: The protocol is based on perfect hashing <ref> [FKS84] </ref> and is thus an example of implicitly using Lemma 1 to give upper bound for communication problems rather than lower bounds for data structure problems. First consider a log l. Before the protocol starts, the two players agree on a prime p between N and 2N 1. <p> Consider the family of hashfunctions h k (x) = (kx mod p) mod 2 2a1 : Bob chooses k so that the number of collisions of h k on his set y is minimized.

Reference-contexts: In section 2 we continue studying the relations between complexity in the cell probe model and asymmetric communication complexity. We show that: * When the number of rounds of communication is constant, the communication complexity also provides upper bounds for cell probe complexity. However, by a result in <ref> [Mil93] </ref>, when the number of rounds of communication is not constant, for almost all data structure problems (with natural choices of parameters) the cell probe complexity is significantly (as much as exponentially) larger than the communication complexity. 2 This may suggest that the asymmetric communication complexity approach is not the best <p> Counting arguments show that for most data structure problems the solution which stores the non-redundant representation of the data and the query algorithm which reads all of it, is in fact optimal: Theorem 3 <ref> [Mil93] </ref> For a random data structure problem f : f0; 1g n fi f0; 1g m ! f0; 1g the following holds with high probability: For any representation using s 2 n1 =b cells of size b, query time (m=b) is necessary.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that the deterministic communication complexity of GT n is linear, and it is known that the randomized complexity is O (log n) <ref> [Ni93] </ref>.

Smirnov [Smi88] shows that this is close to optimal, and Yao (unpublished) improves Smirnov's bounds slightly.
