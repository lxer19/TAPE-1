Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. Our framework represents distinct places as evidence grids, a probabilistic description of occupancy. Place recognition relies on nearest neighbor classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translational differences between the two grids. The learning mechanism is lazy in that it involves the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. Experimental studies with physical and simulated robots suggest that this approach improves place recognition with experience, that it can handle significant sensor noise, that it benefits from improved quality in stored cases, and that it scales well to environments with many distinct places. Additional studies suggest that using historical information about the robot's path through the environment can actually reduce recognition accuracy. Previous researchers have studied evidence grids and place learning, but they have not combined these two powerful concepts, nor have they used systematic experimentation to evaluate their methods' abilities.

Reference-contexts: We generated each training or test case by placing the physical or simulated robot in a position, collecting readings from the sonar ring to construct an initial evidence grid <ref> (Elfes, 1989) </ref>, rotating and/or moving the robot (as described below), collecting new sonar readings and updating the evidence grid, and repeating this process many times. For the simulated robot, we generated six different grids for each of six distinct places, 4 giving 36 total evidence grids.

Reference-contexts: This suggests not only certain learning methods, but also the use of experimental methods prevalent in machine learning <ref> (Kibler & Langley, 1988) </ref> to evaluate our technique. However, the tasks of place recognition and place learning introduce some difficulties not usually present in such learning research, such as the pervasive presence of significant sensor noise, and our approach to the problem is designed with these issues in mind.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we can use the experimental methods developed for machine learning to evaluate the robustness of our framework. In this section we present a number of hypotheses about the system's behavior, followed by experimental tests of those hypotheses, most of which we have reported previously <ref> (Langley & Pfleger, 1995) </ref>. <p> Naturally, we hypothesized that the accuracy of place recognition would improve as the agent encounters more positions. However, the literature sometimes reports actual decreases in performance, so we needed to explicitly test this expectation. As we report elsewhere <ref> (Langley & Pfleger, 1995) </ref>, our first study used the physical Nomad robot to generate 18 evidence grids was based on 45 sonar readings, taken from a single position but with successive rotations incremented by one degree (though still merged into a stored grid with a single orientation).

Reference-contexts: However, this scheme would not guarantee that still larger grids would not occur in the test set, which would make it 3. The main exceptions are methods for inductive logic programming <ref> (Lavrac & Dzeroski, 1993) </ref>, but their first-order representations hardly seem suitable for dealing with evidence grids.

Moreover, this strategy would increase the number of features in an already high-dimensional space, exacerbating the effect of irrelevant attributes.
