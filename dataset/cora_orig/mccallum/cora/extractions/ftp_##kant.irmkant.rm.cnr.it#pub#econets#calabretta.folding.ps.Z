Abstract: We present an "ab initio" method that tries to determine the tertiary structure of unknown proteins by modelling the folding process without using potentials extracted from known protein structures. We have been able to obtain appropriate matrices of folding potentials, i.e. 'forces' able to drive the folding process to produce correct tertiary structures, using a genetic algorithm. Some initial simulations that try to simulate the folding process of a fragment of the crambin that results in an alpha-helix, have yielded good results. We discuss some general implications of an Artificial Life approach to protein folding which makes an attempt at simulating the actual folding process rather than just trying to predict its final result.

Reference-contexts: In fact, as we have observed, the type of conformations that proteins assume during the folding process may differ from final folded conformations. In addition, this approach requires that native conformations of proteins are at global energy minima <ref> (Anfinsen, 1973) </ref>. But, as Baker & Agard (1994) have observed, "there are good reasons to think that the native states of proteins may not be at global energy minima.....there may be large regions of conformational space that are kinetically inaccessible in which a more stable state might exist".

Reference-contexts: The way in which statistics is used to extract potentials is straightforward: the probabilities of observing the parameter of interest are computed and then normalised to correct for sample bias and finally translated into scores <ref> (e.g. Bryant & Lawrence, 1993) </ref>. Neural networks, given their ability to classify noisy stimuli and generalize to new ones, have also been used to predict the secondary structure of proteins (e.g. Rost & Sander, 1994). Powerful optimization methods can also be used.

Reference-contexts: The search in the conformation space of a given protein can be implemented by using different algorithms. In particular Monte Carlo (e.g. Godzik et al., 1992) and genetic algorithms <ref> (e.g. Dandekar & Argos, 1994) </ref> have been used. In the model of Dandekar and Argos (1994), an initial population of different hypothetical three-dimensional structures for a given sequence are generated.

The attempt has been defined as trying to decipher the second half of the genetic code <ref> (Gierasch & King, 1990) </ref>. Success in this area would be the starting point for new research directions with promising results and possible applications in many fields (biology, genetics, drug-design, etc.).

Reference-contexts: Amino acid side-chains are represented as spheres connected to the corresponding C a of backbone with a link of fixed length (see Figure 1); the backbone is represented as a chain of C a atoms linked by pseudobonds between the C a atoms of successive amino acid residues <ref> ( for a similar approach, cf. Oldfield & Hubbard, 1994 ) </ref> . <p> However, selective reproduction will ensure that only individuals that received good mutations will be able to reproduce. The evaluation of tertiary structures can be realized in different ways. For each residue segment one can measure the discrepancy of the alpha-carbon bend and torsion angles <ref> (see Oldfield & Hubbard, 1994) </ref> between the real known tertiary structure and the artificially folded structure produced by each individual matrix of folding potentials. The sum of these discrepancies represent a measure of the error produced by the corresponding folding potentials.

Reference-contexts: The first approach involves scanning a library of sequences and corresponding known structure motifs in search of compatible sequencestructure combinations, i.e. those which correspond to structures which best conform to the known potentials <ref> (see for example Sippl & Weitckus, 1992) </ref>. In this case potentials are used to choose the best combination of chain folds present in the databases. The combinations of folds that best align with the given sequence and best conform to potentials are selected.

Reference-contexts: As Wodak and Rooman (1993) claim, this appears to be due to several factors: (a) experimental mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the overall fold of a protein is much more tolerant to sequence modification <ref> (Sondek & Shortle, 1990) </ref>; (b) analyses of known three-dimensional structures have revealed structural similarity for proteins with different functions (Farber & Petsko, 1990; Kabsch et al., 1990); (c) the number of known high-resolution protein structures has significantly increased allowing computational models to lie on more solid grounds; 2 (d) there is

Reference-contexts: However this hypothesis is in contrast with NMR analysis which appear to suggest that "stable secondary structure first forms the framework necessary for the subsequent formation of the complete tertiary structure" <ref> (Udgaonkar & Baldwin, 1988) </ref>. In addition, it remains to be determined what is the role of the other forces and why is the native structure unique given the fact that hydrophobicity cannot alone determine a unique native structure.
