Abstract: The ability to respond effectively and efficiently to crisis is an important objective in many problem-solving domains. In this paper, we identify three central elements of crisis: threat, urgency, and uncertainty. We define the space of competent problem solvers for crisis response through a task analysis (Newell and Si-mon, 1972). Specifically, we bound the space of problem solvers by determining the features of problem spaces and search control strategies necessary to address the central elements of crisis. We also outline an evaluation method for problem solvers in crisis domains. The task analysis provides a framework for improving crisis response strategies as well as developing intelligent assistants for crisis response.

Reference-contexts: Urgency is addressed through hierarchical planning as well as scheduling capabilities for reasoning about resource constraints, including time constraints. An associated reactive execution component mitigates the effect of uncertainty by allowing the system to adapt executing plans to the runtime situation. In <ref> (Bienkowski and desJardins, 1994) </ref>, a generative planning system is augmented with components for temporal reasoning, case-based reason ing, and scheduling. The temporal reasoning component addresses the temporal aspect of threat, while the case-based reasoning and scheduling components help to mitigate urgency.

Reference-contexts: Because the goal of the search is to find a state that resolves the threat|ideally, a goal that corresponds to an optimal plan|the issue of threat is also implicitly addressed by search control. Decision-theoretic methods may be incorporated into search control for the purpose of finding such goal states <ref> (Feldman and Sproull, 1977) </ref>. Search control can also be used to address uncertainty. Specifically, feedback from the environment during execution can help mitigate the problem of incomplete or incorrect initial information.

Reference-contexts: Because operators define the connectivity of the problem space, higher-order operators can allow a problem solver to explore the space more quickly. For example, in representations where operators correspond to actions, one such higher-order operator is a macro-operator that combines the effects of several actions <ref> (Fikes et al., 1972) </ref>. Another is an abstract operator that represents a class of related actions (Sacer-doti, 1974; Tate, 1977). The indexing and adaptation operators of a case-based planning system (Hammond, 1986) are other examples of higher-order operators that allow larger leaps in the problem space.

The indexing and adaptation operators of a case-based planning system <ref> (Hammond, 1986) </ref> are other examples of higher-order operators that allow larger leaps in the problem space. By reducing the time required to construct an appropriate response, these higher-order operators effectively mitigate the level of urgency faced by the problem solver.

Reference-contexts: Both distinguish goals having temporal scope from those without (i.e., goals of achievement). The first involves a direct treatment of goals of prevention|through inference rules and operators that directly reference goals of prevention (Mc-Dermott, 1982) or through prevention techniques incorporated into the problem-solving mechanism <ref> (Hogge, 1988) </ref>. The second involves transforming goals of prevention into equivalent goals of maintenance (e.g., the goal of preventing the condition of getting wet is the same as the goal of maintaining dryness) and using existing techniques for handling goals of maintenance (Kaelbling, 1988; Schoppers, 1987).

Reference-contexts: Search control can be used to address the urgency of a crisis in two ways. First, an efficient search control mechanism can mitigate the urgency of a crisis by guiding the search to a goal state quickly, with little wasted search. Learning effective search control rules <ref> (Minton, 1988) </ref> is a possible approach to efficient search control strategies. Second, search control can incorporate mechanisms for directly controlling deliberation time subject to externally imposed constraints.

The state space consists of the set of all knowledge states where a state consists of I,A, and V (the information the agent has about the environment, its actions, and its values) and is possibly augmented with internal memory structures (e.g., history, concepts, plans, etc.).

There are also constraints on the available resources. For example, concurrent military exercises in the Atlantic may make particular units unavailable for the evacuation operation.

Reference-contexts: Related and Future Work There have been a few AI planning systems that have been constructed specifically for crisis response planning. Using the framework presented in this paper, we now briefly discuss two that have dealt specifically with noncombatant evacuation operations, as in the Pacifica scenario. O-Plan <ref> (Tate et al., 1994) </ref> is a hierarchical planning system that has been applied to many large-scale planning tasks. In O-Plan, the issue of threat is addressed through the use of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to plan for user-defined tasks.
