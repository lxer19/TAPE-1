Title: Acyclic Multi-Way Partitioning of Boolean Networks  
Author: Jason Cong, Zheng Li, and Rajive Bagrodia

Abstract: Acyclic partitioning on combinational boolean networks has wide range of applications, from multiple FPGA chip partitioning to parallel circuit simulation. In this paper, we present two efficient algorithms for the acyclic multi-way partitioning. One is a generalized FM-based algorithm. The other is based on the theory of maximum fanout-free cone (MFFC) decomposition. The acyclic FM-algorithm usually results in larger cut-size, as expected, compared to the undirected FM-algorithm due to the acyclic constraint. To our surprise, however, the MFFC-based acyclic partitioning algorithm consistently produces smaller (50% on average) cut-sized solutions than the conventional FM-algorithm. This result suggests that considering signal directions during the process can lead to very natural circuit decomposition and clustering, which in turn results in better partitioning solutions. We have also implemented parallel gate level simulators in Maisie and applied our partitioning algorithms to evaluate their impact on circuit simulation.

Reference-contexts: Our simulator is written in Maisie, a simulation language developed at UCLA, which allows a simulation model to be executed in either sequential, parallel conservative, or parallel optimistic modes with minimal changes to the model <ref> [BaLi94] </ref>. Maisie also supports a number of optimizations to reduce both check-pointing and blocking overheads for the corresponding simulation protocol. The simulations reported in this paper used the sequential algorithm to simulate circuits with one, four, and eight partitions on a single processor workstation.

Reference-contexts: In order to obtain an acyclic network after clustering, we apply the maximum fanout-free cone (MFFC) decomposition technique to compute clusters in the given network. The MFFC-decomposition technique was originally proposed by Cong and Ding <ref> [CoDi93] </ref> to compute duplication-free area-optimal technology mapping in lookup-table based FPGA designs. <p> Clearly, if a gate u is in MFFC v , its value affects only gate v and the descendants for gate v . Therefore, it is very natural to cluster u and v together. In general, we can treat each MFFC as a cluster. The results in <ref> [CoDi93] </ref> showed that MFFCs have the following important properties. Lemma 1 If w MFFC v , then MFFC w MFFC v . Lemma 2 Two MFFCs are either disjoint or one must contain another. <p> Note that MFFC decomposition is different from tree decomposition, because an MFFC can contain reconvergent fanout. Given a combinational network N , let MFFC 1 , MFFC 2 , . . . MFFC m be the set of MFFCs in the MFFC decomposition of N , the results in <ref> [CoDi93] </ref> showed that when computing a duplication-free area-optimal mapping of N into K -input lookup tables, we can simply compute a duplication-free area-optimal mapping for each MFFC i (1 i m ) independently.
