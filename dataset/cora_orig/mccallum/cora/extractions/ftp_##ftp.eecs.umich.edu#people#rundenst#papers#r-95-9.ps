Abstract: Whenever the fabrication process consists of several steps and the dynamic modification of individual steps or step sequences of the process is allowed, inter-cell feedback and feed-forward control can both be utilized to improve the quality of the fabrication process. Indeed, feedback and feed-forward control have been identified as important features of the semiconductor manufacturing facility of the future. However, the issue of providing enabling mechanisms for inter-cell control has not been adequately addressed. To fill this gap, we propose a novel design of a generic, adaptable and re-usable software enabler for inter-cell control in manufacturing facilities. This inter-cell controller is realized using active database technology. Active database systems, a recently emerging technology, can automatically carry out rule actions when designated events occur and corresponding conditions become true. For carrying out inter-cell control, the conditions of active database rules can be defined to check for scenarios in which inter-cell control can be utilized to improve the fabrication process. When the conditions for inter-cell control hold, firing of the associated rules causes appropriate actions to be taken to compensate for the errors in processing. The defined rule mechanism, which allows expression of the complete range of conditions for inter-cell control, provides for a generic and adaptable implementation of this type of control. With respect to system integration, the controller is being developed so that it can be integrated into existing manufacturing systems with minimal modification to existing components.

Reference-contexts: allows appropriate rules to be defined and executed for inter-cell control can serve to provide a generic, portable and exible mechanism for this type of control. 3 An active database system is a database system that monitors situations of interest (i.e., events) and, when they occur, actively triggers appropriate responses <ref> [DHW95] </ref>. The desired behavior is expressed in rules. These rules are comprised of event-condition-action (ECA) elements. <p> Instead of having each application survey events and conditions individually and schedule the appropriate reactions (i.e., consistency checks, notification procedures, etc.), this functionality is now incorporated into the active DBMS in a generic reusable fashion. Research in such systems is being actively pursued <ref> [DHW95] </ref>. The desired behavior of active DBMSs is expressed in terms of event-condition-action (ECA) rules. <p> These mechanisms can be utilized for condition checking and hence rule execution is more efficient than in expert systems. Note that active databases have been suggested as a suitable platform for building large and efficient expert systems <ref> [DHW95] </ref>. 4 Providing an Enabler for Inter-Cell Control This section contains a description of the design of the AC for inter-cell control. In Section 4.1, the CIM environment, within which the AC will perform inter-cell control, is described.

Reference-contexts: Decisions for model changes are based on formal statistical tests. As part of the BCAM effort, work has also been carried out on feed-forward and feedback control of photolithography sequences <ref> [LeS92] </ref>. Feed-forward control adjusts the settings of subsequent process steps to compensate for deviation in the middle of a process run. The supervisory controller acts over several processing steps to be executed in a wafer. <p> However, from the published literature it appears that only the BCAM system <ref> [LeS92] </ref> considers the issue of providing inter-cell control. The BCAM system focuses its attention on the one particular process (photolithography) for which it has been developed.

Different approaches for process representation include use of programming language (e.g., [Wil88]) and knowledge-based frameworks (e.g., <ref> [MTH92] </ref>). We are using a knowledge-based approach for developing the AC. In such an approach the process is specified by a hierarchical object-oriented data structure. This data structure is composed of objects that represent different types of operations, e.g., equipment, control, i/o, database.
