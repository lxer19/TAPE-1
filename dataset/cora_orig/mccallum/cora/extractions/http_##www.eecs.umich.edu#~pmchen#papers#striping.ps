Title: Maximizing Performance in a Striped Disk Array  
Author: Peter M. Chen David A. Patterson

Affiliation: Computer Science Division, University of California,  
Abstract: Improvements in disk speeds have not kept up with improvements in processor and memory speeds. One way to correct the resulting speed mismatch is to stripe data across many disks. In this paper, we address how to stripe data to get maximum performance from the disks. Specifically, we examine how to choose the striping unit, i.e. the amount of logically contiguous data on each disk. We synthesize rules for determining the best striping unit for a given range of workloads. We show how the choice of striping unit depends on only two parameters: 1) the number of outstanding requests in the disk system at any given time, and 2) the average positioning time data transfer rate of the disks. We derive an equation for the optimal striping unit as a function of these two parameters; we also show how to choose the striping unit without prior knowledge about the workload.

Reference-contexts: A large striping unit will tend to keep a file clustered together on a few disks (possibly one); a small striping unit tends to spread each file across many disks. Unlike <ref> [Patterson88, Chen90] </ref>, we do not include any redundant data into our data striping scheme; data from each file is simply distributed round-robin over the disks. We use parallelism to describe the number of disks that service a user request for data. <p> One of the redundancy schemes, RAID Level 3, has a striping unit of one byte. Two of the redundancy schemes, RAID Levels 4 and 5, have a striping unit of one block (block-interleaving), where a block remains unspecified. Chen <ref> [Chen90] </ref> conducts hardware experiments on an Amdahl mainframe to further investigate two of the redundancy schemes in [Patterson88]. As part of his evaluation, he compares disk arrays with a striping unit of one sector (4 KB) and one track (40 KB). <p> As part of his evaluation, he compares disk arrays with a striping unit of one sector (4 KB) and one track (40 KB). The workloads that we use in this experiment are essentially the same as in <ref> [Chen90] </ref>. Reddy, et al. [Reddy 89] evaluate a range of disk striping schemes ranging from byte-interleaving to block-interleaving, with a typical block size of 4 KB. In his evaluation, Reddy, et al. assume that byte-interleaved disks are rotationally synchronized with each other, but that block-interleaved disks are not synchronized. <p> This location distribution does not favor any disk over any other; i.e. over time, independent of the striping unit and request size distribution, each disk will see approximately the same number of requests. Some past research (for example, <ref> [Chen90] </ref>), assumed the presence of hot disks, i.e. disks that received more accesses than the others. However, we believe that hot disks are becoming less of a problem for two reasons: first, the increasing file cache size of today's systems will buffer hot data from small files.

However, with the proliferation of smaller diameter disk drives, striping over many disk drives could provide order of magnitude benefits in performance/cost, capacity/cost, power, and volume [Patterson88]. As a result, disk striping research has increased dramatically over the past few years.
