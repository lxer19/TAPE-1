Title: ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS OF NEUTRINO MASS AND MIXINGS  
Author: A.B. Balantekin 
Address: Madison, WI 53706  
Affiliation: Physics Department, University of Wisconsin  
Abstract: Astrophysical implications of neutrino mass and mixings are discussed. The status of solar and atmospheric neutrino problems, and recent developments concerning nuclear physics input to solar models and solar opacities are reviewed. Implications of neutrino mass and mixings in supernova dynamics are explored. The effects of supernova density fluctuations in neutrino propagation is described.

Reference-contexts: The latter kind of input is not trivial to obtain, for example the utility of (p,n) reactions to extract Gamow-Teller strengths was criticized <ref> [19] </ref>. Here I will discuss the former kind of input, since some recent measurements raised questions about previously-used values of S 17 .

Reference-contexts: measurement at RIKEN of the Coulomb breakup cross section of 8 B by 208 Pb into p and 7 Be was used to extract the cross section for the reaction 8 B +fl ! 7 Be + p, from which one can obtain the cross section for the inverse reaction <ref> [20] </ref>. The resulting astrophysical S-factor S 17 is less than those obtained from previous measurements which would reduce the predicted flux of 8 B neutrinos. The reaction measured at RIKEN is an electromagnetic (Coulomb breakup) process.

Reference-contexts: Caution should be exercised when extracting S 17 at low energies since other multipoles, not measured at RIKEN, are expected to contribute to it as well. There are sources of uncertainties in the method of virtual quanta used here (such as determining the value of the lowest impact parameter) <ref> [21] </ref>. It is probably too early to tell if this experiment warrants a lower S 17 before more data are taken. Opacity is another parameter in solar models which had to be recently modified [22].

Reference-contexts: It is probably too early to tell if this experiment warrants a lower S 17 before more data are taken. Opacity is another parameter in solar models which had to be recently modified <ref> [22] </ref>. In the radiative zone of the sun, heat transfer by radiation is controlled by a single opacity parameter, which is a measure of photoab-sorption. <p> Indeed, recent calculations at Livermore increase the opacity by about 15% in the convective zone and about 5% in the core <ref> [22] </ref>. Increasing the opacity, however, raises the core temperature, and consequently increases the neutrino flux and could eliminate the effect of a lowered S 17 .

Reference-contexts: For example iron alone, which is basically a trace element in the sun, contributes about 20%. Changing the opacity alters the rate of heat transfer and consequently the core temperature. By lowering the opacity one can homologously lower <ref> [23] </ref> the temperature profile. Since the rates of the neutrino-producing subbarrier 4 fusion reactions in the sun are governed by quantum-mechanical tunneling, lowering the temperature lowers the rate almost exponentially.

Reference-contexts: There seems to be a persistent discrepancy between theory and experiment. Oscillations of into- t are generally invoked to explain this discrepancy <ref> [34] </ref>. Experimentally the ratio of ratios, R, appears to be independent of zenith angle. The observed zenith angle distribution of low energy atmospheric neutrinos is consistent with no oscillations or with a large number of oscillations for all source-detector distances.

Reference-contexts: The observed zenith angle distribution of low energy atmospheric neutrinos is consistent with no oscillations or with a large number of oscillations for all source-detector distances. Explanations of the low energy atmospheric neutrino anomaly based on the oscillation of 2 neutrino flavors require that the oscillating term <ref> [35] </ref>, cos ( ffim 2 L 2E ), average to zero for even the shortest source-detector distances (L &lt; 50 km for neutrinos from directly overhead.)

NEUTRINO FLAVOR MIXING IN SUPERNOVAE Understanding neutrino transport in a supernova is an essential part of understanding supernova dynamics. In this review, I will only concentrate on the effects of neutrino flavor mixing on supernova dynamics.

Reference-contexts: For a large initial core mass, the shock wave gets stalled at ~ 200 to 500 km away from the center of the proto-neutron star <ref> [37] </ref>. Meanwhile, the proto-neutron star, shrinking under its own gravity, loses energy by emitting neutrinos, which only interact weakly and can leak out on a relatively long diffusion time scale. The question to be investigated then is the possibility of regenerating the shock by neutrino heating. <p> The situation at the onset of neutrino heating is depicted in Figure 1. The density at the neutrinosphere is ~ 10 12 g cm 3 and the density at the position of the stalled shock is ~ 2 fi 10 7 g cm 3 <ref> [37] </ref>. <p> Fuller et al. found that for small mixing angles between -t and -e one can get a 60% 7 increase in the explosion energy <ref> [37] </ref>. There is another implication of the -t and -e mixing in the supernovae. Supernovae are possible r-process sites [38], which requires a neutron-rich environment, i.e., the ratio of electrons to baryons, Y e , should be less than one half.

Reference-contexts: Supernovae are possible r-process sites [38], which requires a neutron-rich environment, i.e., the ratio of electrons to baryons, Y e , should be less than one half. Y e in the nucleosynthesis region is given approximately by <ref> [39] </ref> Y e ' 1 + -e p = en 1 ; (7) where en, etc. are the capture rates. Hence if T -e &gt; T -e , then the medium is neutron-rich. <p> But the MSW effect, by heating -e and cooling -t can reverse the direction of inequality, making the medium proton-rich instead. Hence the existence of neutrino mass and mixings puts severe constraints on heavy-element nucleosynthesis in supernova. These constraints are investigated in Ref. <ref> [39] </ref>. EFFECTS OF DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS If a completely polarized particle beam travels through a random magnetic field for a long enough time, it will be completely depolarized.

Reference-contexts: In a similar way, if different neutrino flavors mix, a completely "polarized" neutrino beam (say all -e ) may become completely "depolarized" (half -e , half -x ) after passing through a medium with fluctuating matter density <ref> [40] </ref>. Note that this can happen without a neutrino magnetic moment, it is simply a new aspect of the MSW mechanism. There is an extensive discussion of neutrino oscillations in inhomogeneous media in the literature [40, 41]. <p> Note that this can happen without a neutrino magnetic moment, it is simply a new aspect of the MSW mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS Neutrino astrophysics is a field with considerable prospects. In this review I only discuss low energy neutrino sources. There are many physics questions, such as the nature of the central engines of active galactic nuclei, which can be explored by doing high energy astrophysics [44].

Reference-contexts: The MSW mechanism may also be relevant in collapsing pre-supernova stellar cores, where adiabatic conversion of electron neutrinos into massive (e.g. -t ) neutrinos could result in readjustment of lepton numbers and small entropy generation <ref> [43] </ref>. A consequent drop in the electron fraction, Y e , could be significant for the mechanism of supernova explosion. The effect of density fluctuations in a collapsing star is plotted in Figure 3.

Most of the time the information obtained from low- and high-energy neutrino astrophysics is complementary. For example, it is possible to look for high-energy 9 neutrino signatures of cold dark matter. Supernova neutrino observations and long-baseline neutrino experiments at somewhat lower energies probe hot dark matter.
