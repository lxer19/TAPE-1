Title: ELECTRIC FIELD INTEGRAL EQUATION VIA SINC CONVOLUTION

Abstract: An efficient sinc-convolution algorithm is introduced for the numerical solution of three-dimensional electric field scattering problems. Applications include petroleum, mineral, and geothermal exploration. The algorithm developed solves the general time-domain three-dimensional electric field integral equation of scattering for half-space problems. It is based on collocation, which enables us to replace the multidimensional convolution-type vector integral equation by a system of algebraic equations. The essence of the algorithm is a certain quadrature formula that enables separation of variables of the multidimensional convolution to approximate convolution-type integrals. The final algorithm overcomes the formation of huge full matrices and therefore reduces required storage, as well as the computational complexity of solving such matrix problems, as compared with classical approaches. In addition, the new algorithm can be readily adapted for parallel computations, which results in an even faster computational speed.

Reference-contexts: The modern computational techniques, however, were established during the 1960s, when tools such as the finite-element method (FEM)[38] and the method of moments (MM)[13,14,18,19,24,21,34,46] were introduced into electromagnetic engineering. Since then, several other pro 2 cedures have been introduced into this discipline. These include the ge-ometrical optics <ref> [3] </ref> approximation, the geometrical theory of diffraction [24], the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method [1,44,45,47,48], The fast Fourier transform (FFT) conjugate gradient method [4,5,6,7], and the point-matching technique [37].

Despite the tremendous progress made in recent years, the calculation of induced electromagnetic (EM) fields in irregularly shaped, heterogeneous dielectric bodies is still a difficult problem <ref> [36] </ref>.

We shall consider here only the case of (2.1), since that of (2.2) is almost exactly the same. One dimensional sinc-convolution is based on the following: 1.

Since V m (! M ; ; ! N ) is the unit matrix, it follows that J so that F (J m ) = (! M ; ; !

The proofs of results presented here can be found in <ref> [39] </ref>. A.1 Sinc Function, Cardinal Function In engineering literature, the term sinc (z) is well known; it is defined by sinc (z) = sin (z) :(8.1) However, there exists a more powerful notation for the sinc function, also known as Cardinal function. <p> 0 and k is an integer, then the Cardinal function, S (k; h), is defined by S (k; h) ffi (z) = (z kh)=h S (k; h) shall thus be referred to as the k 0 th sinc function with step size h; evaluated at z: It is proven (see <ref> [39, 40, 28, 26] </ref> for proofs) that for h &gt; 0, the sequence h 1=2 S (k; h) 1 k=1 is a complete orthonormal sequence in a certain Wiener space of functions. <p> h `=1 (1) where ffi k = 2 (8.7) Z k sin (t) dt: Moreover, for all z 2 C, Z z f (t) dt = h k=1 &lt; 1 X k` f (`h) = S (k; h) ffi (z):(8.8) Again, the proofs for the above claims are documented in <ref> [39] </ref>. These prop erties are the basis for the sinc-convolution method described in this disser tation. <p> of Section 3 in this dissertation): D = z 2 C : fi fi arg z fi fi onto the strip D d : This selection of enables us to consider problems whose solution f are analytic in the "eye-shaped" region D; and which satisfy the relation (For proofs, see <ref> [39] </ref>): fi fi (T z)f (0) zf (T ) fi fi Similarly, for indefinite x-axis and y-axis intervals where (a; b) = (1; +1); one can define by w = (z) = z;(8.18) this function provides a conformal transformation of "the strip" region (see Fig. (6) in Section 3 of this <p> Fig. (6) in Section 3 of this paper: D = fz 2 C : j=zj &lt; dg ;(8.19) onto the strip D d : This selection of enables us to consider problems whose solution f are analytic in the "strip" region D; and which satisfy the relation (For proofs, see <ref> [39] </ref>): f (z) f (1) = O e ffjzj and e fijzj Finally, for semidefinite z-axis interval where (a; b) = (0; 1); one can define either by w = (z) = ln (sinh (z));(8.22) 65 which provides a conformal transformation of "bullet shape" region (see Fig. (7) of Section of <p> in the the sector region D; and which satisfy the relation f (z) f (0) = O (jzj ff ) ; as z ! 0 (8.28) f (z) f (+1) = O jzj fi as z ! 1 (8.29) The analysis and proofs for these statements are documented in reference <ref> [39] </ref>. All of these mapping functions, (there are several other mappings of the same class possible for problems on R), guarantee the same order of accuracy in the final approximations in M ff;fi (D). <p> Thus, the rapid convergence of sinc-convolution approximation method described in this dissertation as well as other sinc based 66 approximation methods, many of them described in details and documented in <ref> [39, 28] </ref>, are guaranteed. 67
