Title: ProcessWeb Process Support for the World Wide Web

Abstract: This paper reports on a small experiment, which although relatively simple, raises important issues about Process Model User Interfaces. It outlines an approach to the exploitation of the World Wide Web by Process-centred Software Support Environments. It concludes that there is great advantage to be gained from designing process systems so that they are more reactive and rather less prescriptive than the current generation of such systems.

Virtually all current UIs to PSEE's support the notion of a work context. Early PWI supports the concept through the provision of a Role Agenda.

Reference-contexts: The PSEE/WWW system provides a context mechanism, giving privacy and ordering, and a page updating mechanism. This basically introduces a partially prescriptive environment, which has all manner of uses in the support of co-operative work. The process view. Using PWI gives much more active process support <ref> [3] </ref>. Early PWI is very specific in presenting each user with their set of appropriate next actions. The process only progresses when specific actions are taken; the user is not given facilities for browsing around the process.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The problem area of concern to a Process-centred Software Support Environment (PSSE) is that of computer systems which provide a set of facilities to support people (primarily software engineers) and organisations (as opposed simply to individuals) concerned with all aspects of computer systems development <ref> [4] </ref>. The World Wide Web (WWW), provided via the Internet, also provides similar potential support. This paper considers the possibility of integrating the systems to give some mutual benefit to both.
