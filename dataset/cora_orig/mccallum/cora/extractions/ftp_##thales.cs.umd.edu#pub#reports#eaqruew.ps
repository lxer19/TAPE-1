Title: Error Analysis of QR Updating with Exponential Windowing  
Author: G. W. Stewart 
Date: May 1991 CS-TR 2685  
Pubnum: UMIACS-TR-91-79  
Abstract: Exponential windowing is a widely used technique for suppressing the effects of old data as new data is added to a matrix. Specifically, given an n fi p matrix X n and a "forgetting factor" fi 2 (0; 1), one works with the matrix diag(fi n1 ; fi n2 ; : : : ; 1)X n . In this paper we examine an updating algorithm for computing the QR factorization of diag(fi n1 ; fi n2 ; : : : ; 1)X n and show that it is unconditionally stable in the presence of rounding errors. fl Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: Is is easily seen that the sequence of triangular matrices R n so generated are the R-factors of the matrices X n . The details of this updating algorithm may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. It requires O (p 2 ) arithmetic operations. Exponential windowing and updating allows us to look at the local behavior of an arbitrarily long sequence of data.

Reference-contexts: Thus, there is never a need to restart the computation to get rid of accumulated rounding errors. Second, we have focused on the QR factorization for the sake of simplicity. However, the analysis applies mutatis mutandis to more complicated decomposition such as the URV and ULV decomposition <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, in which unitary transformations are applied to both sides of D n X n . The key is to observe that the updating algorithms have backward error analyses in the spirit of Theorem 2.1.

A proof of this theorem may be found in <ref> [4, Ch.3, xx20-24] </ref>. The analysis of the updating algorithm with exponential windowing amounts to the recursive application of the bound (2.2). As is typical in backward rounding error analyses, we let let quantities stand for their computed values.
