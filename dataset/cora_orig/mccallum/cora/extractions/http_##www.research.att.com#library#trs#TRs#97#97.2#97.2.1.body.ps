Abstract: Digital signatures provide a mechanism for guaranteeing integrity and authenticity of Web content but not more general notions of security or trust. Web-aware applications must permit users to state clearly their own security policies and, of course, must provide the cryptographic tools for manipulating digital signatures. This paper describes the REFEREE trust management system for Web applications; REFEREE provides both a general policy-evaluation mechanism for Web clients and servers and a language for specifying trust policies. REFEREE places all trust decisions under explicit policy control; in the REFEREE model, every action, including evaluation of compliance with policy, happens under the control of some policy. That is, REFEREE is a system for writing policies about policies, as well as policies about cryptographic keys, PICS label bureaus, certification authorities, trust delegation, or anything else. In this paper, we flesh out the need for trust management in Web applications, explain the design philosophy of the REFEREE trust management system, and describe a prototype implementation of REFEREE.

Reference-contexts: Credentials and policies are the raw materials for making trust decisions. A credential is a statement, purportedly made by some speaker. A policy determines the conditions under which a particular action is allowed. Following <ref> [BFL] </ref>, we use the term trust management to refer to the problem of deciding whether requested actions, supported by credentials, conform to policies. <p> We refer to the processing of such a request as "evaluating compliance with a policy." In current Web applications, the prototypical credential is a PICS label [RM], which states some properties of an Internet resource (e.g., executable code has been virus-checked). An important idea of <ref> [BFL] </ref> that we use in this work is that of "programmable credentials." Rather than simply making unconditional statements, programmable credentials can examine statements made by other credentials and fetch information from the network before deciding which statements to make. <p> The "Everything Else" refers to credentials, whose evaluation (execution) also needs to be under policy control. In placing everything under policy control, REFEREE differs from PolicyMaker, the trust management system described in <ref> [BFL] </ref>. In particular, PolicyMaker does not permit policies to control credential-fetching or signature-verification; it assumes that the calling application has gathered all of the relevant credentials and verified all digital signatures before calling the trust management system.

Reference-contexts: For a more thorough discussion of the difficulties caused by allowing the trust management system to return a value of "unknown," see <ref> [BFRS, Section 4] </ref>.) Further, it may be counter-productive to hide the fact that a decision could not be reached under the current policy from calling applications, especially when the policy is invoked as a subprogram of another policy, which may have alternative policies for dealing with a lack of credentials.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Java applet interpreter tries to provide an execution environment in which programs can only perform "harmless" actions. The PCC system (for "proof carrying code") requires mobile programs to prove to potential hosts that they are "harmless" <ref> [N, NL] </ref>. A wealth of cryptographic protocols attempt to eliminate dangers by enforcing secrecy or authenticity. A complementary approach focuses on trust. To trust is to undertake a potentially dangerous operation knowing that it is potentially dangerous.
