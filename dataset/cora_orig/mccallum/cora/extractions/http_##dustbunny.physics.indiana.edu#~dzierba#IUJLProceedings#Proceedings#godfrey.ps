Title: Light qq Resonances: Spectrum and Decays

Abstract: I give a brief introduction to light q q resonances. The properties of q q states are discussed in the context of the constituent quark model, including predictions for mass and partial decay widths. Problems and puzzles in the meson spectrum are pointed out with an emphasis on how an 8+ GeV photon beam can address these. I also point out some areas where I believe theoretical study would be useful.

Reference-contexts: This could have important implications elsewhere. For example, one possiblility of electroweak symmetry breaking is that at high energies the weak interactions become strong.

Our ultimate goal is to find evidence for non-q q states. Providing a good template is an important starting point against which we can compare the properties of exotic candidates. <p> Thus, measurement of both heavy quarkonium and mesons with light quark content probe different regions of the confinement potential and complement each other. q q separation in some representative mesons. From Ref. <ref> [1] </ref>. Another way of showing this is given in Fig. 2 which plots the regge trajectories of the isovector, strange, and strangeonium mesons on a Chew-Frautschi plot [2].

There is good agreement for the masses of the leading orbital excitations which supports the linearity of the confining potential. <p> There is good agreement for the masses of the leading orbital excitations which supports the linearity of the confining potential.

Reference-contexts: One way of including higher Fock space components in the context of the quark model is to include coupling to decay channels in a coupled channel approach <ref> [5] </ref> while another parametrizes these effects as potentials in final state interactions [6]. Recent work finds that including higher components of the Fock space can lead to large changes of the hadron properties [7]. For example the work of Weinstein [5] has shown that coupling the q q states to mesons <p> include coupling to decay channels in a coupled channel approach <ref> [5] </ref> while another parametrizes these effects as potentials in final state interactions [6]. Recent work finds that including higher components of the Fock space can lead to large changes of the hadron properties [7]. For example the work of Weinstein [5] has shown that coupling the q q states to mesons can lead to shifts in the resonance pole. Likewise, Geiger and Swanson [8] have found that including final state interactions in hadron decays can have an effect on decay properties. <p> Before proceeding I think it is important to introduce additional effects whose study is still in its infancy. The first of these effects is to include coupled channel effects in the study of mesons. In the simplest example Weinstein <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that the multiplet degeneracy (ignoring spin dependent interactions) can be broken by coupling the q q Hamiltonian to a meson-meson scattering Hamiltonian. The coupling between the q q channel and the meson-meson channel is included via a MM $ q q transition operator. <p> The K 0 and K 2 are obtained from the S and Dwave scattering of K respectively while the K 1 is obtained from swave scattering of a K fl pair. From Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>. 2.6 Summary of Mesonic States Our knowledge of light meson spectroscopy is summarized in Fig. 5. Note that most radial and orbital excitations are missing. This question must be addressed but it is likely due to a number of reasons.

Reference-contexts: This form has been verified by lattice calculations in the heavy quark limit and using lattice derived potentials gives reasonably good results for the b b and cc spectra <ref> [9] </ref>. Although the constituent quark model using this potential gives a good description of hadrons with light quarks there is no rigorous theoretical justification for why it should work so well in the light quark sector.

Reference-contexts: As to the problems alluded to, one notes that there are currently two candidates for the 3 P 1 state, the f 1 =E (1420) and the f 0 1 (1530).
