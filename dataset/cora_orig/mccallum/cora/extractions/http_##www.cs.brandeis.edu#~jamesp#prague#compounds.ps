Abstract: The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems. We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples sufficiently expressive lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the nouns in a compound provide relational structure enabling compositional interpretation of the modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995). We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural language understanding, machine translation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be applied to multi-lingual information extraction tasks.

Reference-contexts: Given the sparsity of data to support a statistically based approach we believe that the way forward in this area is to pursue the integration of a rule-based approach with a statistical model. Such integration has already proven effective in the treatment of sense extension phenomena <ref> (Copestake and Briscoe 1995) </ref>. We leave further investigation of this integration for future work. This work also has important consequences for applications in multilingual natural language processing. The most obvious of these is the use of a cross-linguistic approach to complex nominals in machine translation.

Reference-contexts: They are schemata which license the availability of complex nominals, which we treat as phrasal signs. These schemata are essentially phrase structure rules. Compounds are licensed and interpreted as part of the process of parsing. The combination of words into compound forms could also be captured using lexical rules <ref> (Flickinger 1987, Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref>. We have chosen to use phrase structure schemata rather than lexical rules on the basis of storage considerations. Each lexical rule used for compounds will license a great many modifiers for large number of potential heads.

Reference-contexts: In essence, the qualia structure provides the `glue' which links together the semantic contributions of modifying nouns and the head noun in the compound. This approach has significant advantages over approaches which introduce abstract relations to describe the form of modification involved <ref> (Levi 1978, Jones 1995) </ref>, in that it assimilates the composition of complex nominals to other compositional processes of natural language.

Reference-contexts: One approach to this task is to use the GL representation language essentially as an interlingua <ref> (McDonald 1995) </ref>. The phrase structure schemata for English are used in order to determine potential interpretations for a given English compound construction. The most likely interpretation from the candidate set is picked on the basis of contextual and statistical models.

Reference-contexts: In order to account for the availability of compound forms in English, we utilize a family of phrase structure schemata. These schemata are essentially the same kind of entity as the Imme diate Dominance Schemata employed in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1994) </ref>. They are schemata which license the availability of complex nominals, which we treat as phrasal signs. These schemata are essentially phrase structure rules. Compounds are licensed and interpreted as part of the process of parsing.

Reference-contexts: We return to applications of this work later in Section 7. Our analysis of compounds in English and complex nominals in Italian utilizes the representational framework of the Generative Lexicon (GL) <ref> (Pustejovsky 1991,1995) </ref>. The next section provides a brief sketch of this approach. 2 The Generative Lexicon For the purposes of this paper, we will simplify the representational structure of a GL lexical entry to include four levels of representation: type structure, argument structure, event structure (for verbs), and qualia structure.
