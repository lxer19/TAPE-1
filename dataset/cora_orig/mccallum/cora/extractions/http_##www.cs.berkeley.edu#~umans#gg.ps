Title: Hamiltonian Cycles in Solid Grid Graphs (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Christopher Umans William Lenhart 
Address: U.C. Berkeley Williams College  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division Computer Science Department  
Abstract: A grid graph is a finite node-induced subgraph of the infinite two-dimensional integer grid. A solid grid graph is a grid graph without holes. For general grid graphs, the Hamiltonian cycle problem is known to be N P-complete. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the Hamiltonian cycle problem in solid grid graphs, resolving a longstanding open question posed in [IPS82]. In fact, our algorithm can identify Hamil-tonian cycles in quad-quad graphs, a class of graphs that properly includes solid grid graphs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A grid graph is a finite node-induced subgraph of the infinite two-dimensional integer grid. A solid grid graph is a grid graph all of whose bounded faces have area one. The study of Hamiltonian cycles in grid graphs was initiated by Itai, Papadimitriou and Szwarcfiter <ref> [IPS82] </ref>, who proved that the problem for general grid graphs is N P-complete, and gave a polynomial-time algorithm for rectangular solid grid graphs.
