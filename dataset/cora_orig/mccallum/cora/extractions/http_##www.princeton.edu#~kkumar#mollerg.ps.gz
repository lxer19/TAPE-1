Reference-contexts: A non-zero asymmetry constitutes parity nonconservation and signals the presence of pseudo-scalar terms in the cross-section. For Q 2 t M 2 Z , A LR is proportional to the ratio of these amplitudes and is about 10 4 for Q 2 ~ 1 (GeV/c) 2 <ref> [1] </ref>. The SLAC measurement of parity violation in deep inelastic scattering off nucleons performed in 1978-79 [2] was the first to devise experimental techniques required to measure such small asymmetries.

Such a method has already been developed in previous experiments <ref> [4] </ref>. As described in Appendix B, steering coils and an energy vernier are slowly ramped during data taking and the response of BPMs to these changes are recorded.

Reference-contexts: In elastic scattering, the important theoretical uncertainties arise from the lack of knowledge of strange quark form factors, whereas in deep inelastic scattering, theoretical uncertainties originate from strange sea quark distributions and the magnitude of higher twist effects <ref> [5] </ref>. In this proposal, we consider the Mtller scattering of polarized electrons off atomic electrons, a purely leptonic reaction which is calculable to a high accuracy in the electroweak theory.

Reference-contexts: Its behaviour as function of cos fi (Eqn. 2) is shown in Fig. 2a. The parity-violating asymmetry A LR , due to the interference between the weak and electromagnetic diagrams in Fig. 1, is given by <ref> [6] </ref> A LR = mE p 16 sin 2 fi where G F is the Fermi coupling constant and g ee is the pseudo-scalar weak neutral current coupling governing Mtller scattering.

Reference-contexts: The one loop electroweak radiative corrections to A LR have been estimated by Czarnecki and Marciano <ref> [7] </ref>. The most important loop corrections come from the fl Z mixing and the anapole moment diagrams illustrated in Fig. 3. <p> Instead, one uses a dispersion relation to relate those vacuum polarization effects to e + e ! hadrons data. The authors of Ref. <ref> [7] </ref> assign a conservative error to this contribution, corresponding to ffi (sin 2 W ) ~ 0:00055. <p> The effect of bremsstrahlung on the theoretical prediction will depend on the detector geometry and the spectrometer design. On general grounds, the authors of Ref. <ref> [7] </ref> argue that the effects will be small and calculable with high accuracy. The reason is that soft photon effects, including radiation damping, factorize and cancel in the asymmetry ratio.

Reference-contexts: The projected experimental measurement would establish the running of sin 2 W at the 8 level. Currently, this running has been established with marginal significance, ~ 2, as E158 Proposal 12 shown in Fig. 4 with values derived from a compilation for a recent global analysis <ref> [9] </ref>. The impact of the Mtller asymmetry measurement on establishing this remarkable prediction of the standard model is also shown.

Reference-contexts: The sensitivity ranges from 600 to 900 GeV for the Z 0 mass in specific models, similar to that expected with one or two years of data in the next running cycle of the Tevatron <ref> [10] </ref>. There are two important reasons why an indirect search for new neutral gauge bosons is a necessary complement to direct searches in high energy colliders.

Reference-contexts: While the exact expression is renormalization scheme dependent, to a good approximation one can write: sin 2 ^ W (M 2 where ff is the fine structure constant. The current world average is X = 0:38 0:51 <ref> [23] </ref>. We compare this sensitivity to other potential measurements of the X parameter in Table 3. It should be emphasized that the nature of the radiative corrections that are described by the three new parameters are different in character from S, T and U .

Reference-contexts: We propose to use a 1.5 meter long liquid hydrogen target, similar in design to the target used in a parity violation experiment called SAMPLE <ref> [24] </ref> at the MIT-Bates laboratory. Specifications for the proposed target are given in Table 5. The SLAC target will be longer than the Bates target, and will have more stringent requirements on the target window curvature and on possible allowable density fluctuations.

Reference-contexts: Photons originating from radiative processes in the target can reach the detector only after bouncing twice on the vacuum pipe apertures or collimators. A similar strategy was employed successfully in the small angle/large acceptance E142/3 <ref> [25] </ref> and E154/155 spectrometers [26]. The first order optics matrix of the chicane is equivalent to that of a drift length in both horizontal and vertical directions, since the chicane is designed to operate as an achromat.

Reference-contexts: toroid comparator will be placed around the beam axis downstream of the detectors which will be set so that the maximum possible fraction of primary beam lost in ESA is limited to 20%. 3.3.4 Simulation Results We have a carried out an investigation of the spectrometer design using a GEANT <ref> [27] </ref> Monte Carlo simulation of 10 7 48.3 GeV electrons traversing a 1.5 meter hydrogen target. A complete treatment of multiple and single coulomb scattering, energy loss fluctuations and bremsstrahlung were included. Above a threshold of 10 MeV, discrete ffi-ray and bremsstrahlung interactions were simulated.

Reference-contexts: Such detectors have been tested as possibilities for very forward angle calorimeters at future colliders and are expected to withstand radiation doses exceeding 1 Grad <ref> [28] </ref>. Alternative choices include liquid or high pressure noble gas ionization detectors. However, considerations such as low energy neutron proton scattering, cryogenics and edge effects make these choices potentially more complicated. In the following, we describe the geometry of a quartz-tungsten detector. <p> MIPs create a signal of 800 MeV in a 30 RL device <ref> [28] </ref>, so it will be 400 MeV for our design, or 3% of the signal from a single electron. The short detector will also provide suppression of pion backgrounds. The average contribution from charged pions will be about 12% of the electron signal at 10 GeV.

Reference-contexts: We plan to make a few minor improvements to this design and achieve 2 fi 10 5 for this proposal. 3.6 Beam Polarimeter The electron beam polarization measurement will employ a polarized target identical to that which was used for E154/E155 <ref> [29] </ref>. A magnetized foil will be moved into the electron beam downstream of the hydrogen target. A pair of Helmholtz coils will produce a few 100 Gauss longitudinal magnetic field required for the alignment of the atomic electrons. <p> The dominant error comes from the measurement of the foil polarization which is typically around 2%[32]. Target non-uniformities will be eliminated by using several foils. We will assume a total systematic error of 2.7%, which has been achieved in several previous experiments <ref> [29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A pair of Helmholtz coils will produce a few 100 Gauss longitudinal magnetic field required for the alignment of the atomic electrons. Comparison of the raw asymmetry with the QED asymmetry for ~e ~e scattering with appropriate dilution factors provides a determination of the beam polarization <ref> [30] </ref>. The same spectrometer setup that will be used to measure the electroweak asymmetry will also be used to carry out the beam polarization measurements. An additional outer collimator may be put in place during polarization measurements in order to limit the count rate in the detectors.

A Intensity Feedback at the Polarized Source A.1 Existing Polarized Electron Source (PES) A schematic of the current SLAC Polarized Electron Source <ref> [34] </ref> is shown in Fig. 14. Polarized electrons are produced by photoemission from a GaAs photocathode. Different laser light sources are used for ESA and SLC physics programs due to the different pulse structures required (see Table 12).

Charge Limit is a phenomenon whereby the instantaneous photocathode QE decreases appreciably due to high incident light fluxes, and thereby limits the maximum electron charge that can be extracted.

Reference-contexts: Small contributions to the asymmetry also arise from transmission asymmetries in the laser transport optics (again due to residual linear polarization of the laser light <ref> [38] </ref>), and from steering effects of the CP Pockels cell. These steering effects can be minimized by imaging the CP Pockels cell onto the photocathode.
