Abstract: This paper describes the results of using a reactive control software architecture to enable an underwater robot to autonomously search for and visit objects in the dynamic environment of a shallow water harbor. The software architecture draws from the ideas of universal plans and subsumption's layered control, producing reaction plans that exploit low-level competences as operators. The robot was to detect and localize vertical targets in an area of operations, safely navigate to within a standoff radius of each one, and return. Control theoretic algorithms developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution served as smooth transit and station-keeping competences. Selective perception was employed between a narrow-beam, high-frequency search sonar and wide-beam low-frequency sonars, which monitored for obstacles throughout the operations. In demonstration runs in the harbor, the robot successfully found and visited moored PVC pipes with remarkable accuracy in positioning and target localization, while negotiating wave surges, shifting currents, and moving schools of fish. Precise position measurements were made using a transponder network, and the resulting data have been used to characterize vehicle dynamic response in the presence of nearsurface wave motion in shallow water. In a surprise run, the vehicle was able to detect the 1/2" diameter mooring of the target rather than the target itself. This is the first time such a task has been performed autonomously by an underwater robot in a shallow water environment. The architecture was previously reported to be effective for simple pilot-aiding and exploration tasks in a test tank. Thus, the results reported herein indicate that the architecture will scale well to more complex tasks in extremely dynamic environments. In particular, the results have application to the localization, inspection, and clearing of objects in shallow water.

Reference-contexts: We had successfully integrated the WHOI control theoretic work [Yoerger & Slotine 91] and our situated reasoning architecture work <ref> [Bonasso 91] </ref> to carry out exploration and pilot-aiding obstacle avoidance tasks in an indoor test tank [Bonasso 92]. Though these tasks were useful, particularly with human supervision, they required only obstacle avoidance and directional sensing and were of relatively low complexity.

Reference-contexts: We had successfully integrated the WHOI control theoretic work [Yoerger & Slotine 91] and our situated reasoning architecture work [Bonasso 91] to carry out exploration and pilot-aiding obstacle avoidance tasks in an indoor test tank <ref> [Bonasso 92] </ref>. Though these tasks were useful, particularly with human supervision, they required only obstacle avoidance and directional sensing and were of relatively low complexity. We desired to see how the architecture would scale to more complex tasks with more sophisticated sensors. <p> These measurements were used to refine the vehicle dynamic model and to modify the control laws for improved performance under wave stimulation. Joystick Following and Obstacle Avoidance Behaviors Obstacle avoidance and joystick following were developed on an earlier vehicle and detailed in <ref> [Bonasso 92] </ref>. The joystick following reduction rule was modified (Figure 3) so that the robot, if moved off the joystick set point by waves or while avoiding obstacles, would return to the set point coordinates, but not the set point heading, thus maintaining a monotonic clockwise scan. <p> These capabilities had been demonstrated with the Hylas in a test tank prior to going dockside. The dockside tests verified the new control laws and reverified the other behaviors. As described in <ref> [Bonasso 92] </ref>, the reaction plans and high-level control behaviors executed on a microExplorer, while the stability and low-level control executed on the surface computer/on-board transputer system. The two were connected via RS232.

Reference-contexts: In 1992, we turned our attention to a shallow water environment to further test the capability of our software architecture, and to explore vehicle dynamics and sensor issues. A previous effort <ref> [Bonasso et al, 92] </ref> demonstrated that our architecture scaled well to a find and fetch task with multiple sensors in an outdoor environment, but the shallow water environment with its random wave surges, obscured field of view and moving biological obstacles (schools of fish) would pose a much more dynamic venue.

Reference-contexts: This paper focuses on the reactive control results. We are using a reactive agent software architecture wherein reaction plans [Schoppers 89] use subsumption <ref> [Brooks 86] </ref> competences as operators. The benefits are that reaction plans need only map agent states into competences, thus reducing their size, and that formal goal representations may be used to augment the limited representational power of the subsumption competences.

Brutzman <ref> [Brutzman et al, 92] </ref> has demonstrated the use of expert systems in classifying mine-like targets in a swimming pool using an underwater vehicle. The vehicle uses sonars to map the area of interest, uploads the data, and then processes the data offline.

Reference-contexts: The behaviors are discussed in more detail below. Trajectory-following and Station Keeping Behaviors The x-y, z (depth), and heading controllers developed at WHOI for this task were based on basic spring-mass-damping control laws (see for example, <ref> [Dean & Wellman 91] </ref>, Chapter 2). Additional terms for the added mass and drag induced by wave motion were obtained by dynamic experiments in a test tank.

Reference-contexts: We believe that this layer of control theoretic motion, when integrated with the reactive character of the sequencer, is what allowed us to detect the 1/2" mooring of one of the targets at ten meters.

Reference-contexts: The benefits are that reaction plans need only map agent states into competences, thus reducing their size, and that formal goal representations may be used to augment the limited representational power of the subsumption competences. Written in the GAPPS/Rex programming language <ref> [Kaelbling 88] </ref>, the reaction plans and the layered competences are expressed using propositional reduction rules. These are subsequently compiled into a circuit formalism which supports direct analysis of parallelism and enforces a constant time cycle execution regimen.
