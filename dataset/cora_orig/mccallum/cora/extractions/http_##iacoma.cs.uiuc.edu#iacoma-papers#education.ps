Abstract: The University of Illinois has traditionally been a major center for computer architecture education and research in the nation. This short paper briefly describes the computer architecture curriculum at the University of Illinois and discusses a few ideas for improving the computer architecture education of our students. In particular, to improve the education of undergraduates, we suggest a higher emphasis on parallel architectures and programming, and the provision of practical experiences. For graduate students, we argue about the need to develop close links with industry and educate graduate students from other scientific and engineering disciplines.

Reference-contexts: One of the books used is Mano's [3]. * Basic Computer Architecture. This course, often taken at the junior level, focuses on basic architecture concepts like assembly programming, pipelining, and memory hierarchies. Books that have been used include Patterson and Hen nessy's [5] and Feldman and Retter's <ref> [1] </ref>. * Hardware Laboratory. This course, which comes in several flavors, is taken by both undergraduate and graduate students. The work typically involves the use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to design systems like memory or cache controllers, processors, memory systems, or network components. * Computer Organization.
