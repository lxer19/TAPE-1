Reference-contexts: During the past few years, several efforts have been addressed to including probabilities in tmss. tmss incorporating measures of uncertainty are usually called Belief Maintenance Systems (bmss). Falkenhainer [ Falken-hainer, 1986 ] developed a Justification-based bms, including probability in a jtms. D'Ambrosio <ref> [ D'Ambrosio, 1987 ] </ref> , de Kleer and Williams [ de Kleer and Williams, 1987 ] , and Laskey and Lehner [ Laskey and Lehner, 1989 ] , augmented the atms formalism with probability measures.

Reference-contexts: When this happens, the jtms flows backward the chain of dependencies and identifies the set of assumptions responsible for such a contradiction. A second class of tmss has been introduced by de Kleer <ref> [ de Kleer, 1986a ] </ref> under the name of Assumption-based tmss (atmss). In atmss, a proposition is labeled with the minimal consistent set of assumptions under which it can be proved.

Reference-contexts: This ability, coupled with an efficient method to retract previous assumptions, can be extremely useful to implement effective contradiction handling procedures. The lbms also inherits from the tmss the consumer-based architecture <ref> [ de Kleer, 1986b ] </ref> that allows an easy development of problem solvers on top of it.

Reference-contexts: All these efforts share the same probabilistic framework: they basically rely on the theory of belief functions introduced by Dempster <ref> [ Dempster, 1968 ] </ref> and further developed by Shafer [ Shafer, 1976 ] . In the Dempster-Shafer theory, the belief of a proposition expresses the probability of its provability, rather than the probability of its truth.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Truth maintenance systems (tmss) are independent reasoning modules which incrementally maintain the beliefs of a general problem solving system, enabling it to reason with temporary assumptions in the growth of incomplete information. The concept of truth maintenance system is due to Doyle <ref> [ Doyle, 1979 ] </ref> . While all tmss incrementally manipulate propositions and relations among propositions, during the past decade three main classes of tmss have emerged. Systems belonging to the first class, introduced in Doyle's paper, are called Justification-based tmss (jtmss).

Reference-contexts: Since the standard concepts of soundness and completeness apply to point-valued truth-values, we need alternative definitions able to deal with interval truth-values. We will follow the extended definitions of soundness and completeness for probabilistic inferences due to Grosof <ref> [ Grosof, 1986 ] </ref> . 4.1 Soundness We assume the following definition of soundness. Definition 1 (Soundness) A set of probabilistic inferences is sound if and only if for each proposition a the inferred truth-value for P (a) is a superset of the entailed truth-value for P (a). <p> Since label refinement with the Waltz algorithm is known to be deductively sound, so is the lbms which simply iterates the application of a sound set of constraints. 4.2 Completeness According to Grosof <ref> [ Grosof, 1986 ] </ref> , the definition of completeness is the following. Definition 2 (Completeness) A set of probabilistic inferences is complete if and only if for each proposition a the inferred truth-value for P (a) is a subset of the entailed truth-value for P (a).

Reference-contexts: We will preliminarily describe the fundamentals of probabilistic logic, and then we will outline the concepts and implementation of the lbms. 2 Probabilistic Logic The idea of a probabilistic logic, as the theory of probability distributions over logical sentences, dates back to Keynes <ref> [ Keynes, 1921 ] </ref> , was mathematically established by Koopman [ Koopman, 1939 ] , and was introduced in the AI community by Nilsson [ Nilsson, 1986 ] as an intuitive but foundational account of reasoning under uncertainty in automated problem solving.

Reference-contexts: The third class comprises systems called Logic-based tmss (ltmss). These systems manipulate full propositional formulas built from propositions and truth-functional connectives, rather than networks of dependencies, and propagate truth values using a unit resolution style algorithm called Boolean Constraint Propagation (bcp) <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . In a ltms, logical formulas are recorded in clausal form. Each clause (a finite disjunction of atomic propositions) represents a logical constraint on the truth-values of its propositions.

Since the standard concepts of soundness and completeness apply to point-valued truth-values, we need alternative definitions able to deal with interval truth-values.

Reference-contexts: The INFERNO system [ Quinlan, 1983 ] , that is usually regarded as a local approximation to probabilistic logic <ref> [ Nilsson, 1993 ] </ref> , exhibits this kind of behavior. Because of that, INFERNO has been strongly criticized [ Spiegelhal-ter, 1986; Pearl, 1988 ] . <p> Since we have devised an efficient method to calculate the overlapping factor, and since probabilistic entailment is known to be intractable in nature <ref> [ Nilsson, 1993 ] </ref> the incompleteness of the lbms represents a compromise between functionality and efficiency. Furthermore, the representation in the lbms of a probabilistic model expressed in terms of conditional probabilities produces a set of clauses that is exactly the one needed to calculate the overlapping factor.

Because of that, INFERNO has been strongly criticized <ref> [ Spiegelhal-ter, 1986; Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . <p> This requirement can be easily met by the bcp, since the inference rules of classical logic are strictly local. In a probabilistic framework, "the luxury of ignoring the rest of the database cannot be maintained" <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . Consider example (5): the four clauses define a complete probabilistic model for the atomic propositions a and b.

Reference-contexts: fl (a) = P fl (a) = 1 X (1 P (:a _ i )) (11) thus causing the probability bounds of a to converge monotonically towards a point-valued probability. 3.2 Propagation Propagating the above defined constraints over a network of clauses is quite easy. bcp uses Waltz's propagation algorithm <ref> [ Waltz, 1975 ] </ref> . We just need to follow its extension to interval values due to Davis [ Davis, 1987 ] . According to Davis' classification of interval-based constraint propagation systems, the lbms belongs to the category called label inference.
