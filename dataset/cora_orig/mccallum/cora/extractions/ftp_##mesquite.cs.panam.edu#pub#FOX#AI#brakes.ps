Abstract: In this paper, we present a system to perform automated mechanical diagnosis of a car's brake system. The diagnostic process is performed by using the Generic Tasks of Hierarchcial Classification and Routine Recognition. A classification hierarchy is used to represent the possible malfunctions of a car's brake system. The two Generic Tasks are used to traverse the malfunction hierarchy in an attempt to establish the most likely malfunction hypothesis (or hypotheses) provided a description of the car's current condition as input. This paper details the Generic Tasks of Hierarchical Classification and Routine Recognition, provide an in depth description of the brake system, and offer an example of the brake system performing diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: The establish/reject knowledge can take on many forms (neural network, bayesian probability, pattern matching, predicate calculus, etc...) Routine recognition is a task which enables a problem solving agent to generate a belief in the hypothesis 2 or concept that the agent represents <ref> [1] </ref>. The more closely the input matches the expectations of the concept being represented by the agent, the higher the belief will be that the concept is present.

Reference-contexts: Each node in a classification hierarchy may have an associated recognition agent. Two tools are available for the construction of problem solving systems consisting of these two Generic Tasks. CSRL <ref> [2, 7, 5] </ref> is used to construct classification hierarchies by constructing individual classification specialists. A classification specialist is a single node in the hierarchy, representing a single hypothesis or object within the domain.

Reference-contexts: This output represents those nodes which were established as "plausible". A node in the hierarchy will represent some concept (or object), and in diagnosis, each node might represent a hypothesis that a malfunction might be present. The Generic Task of Hierarchical Classification <ref> [3, 9] </ref> is the process of searching through a classification hierarchy for the most specific nodes which plausibly describe the data. A node which is established during this search can then be refined into more detail by attempting to establish any of that node's children.

Reference-contexts: The diagnostician uses the hierarchy as a search space to perform the diagnosis by seeking the most likely malfunctions within the hierarchy. And so, diagnosis is often synonymous with classification <ref> [4] </ref>. Automating the process of diagnosis requires the representation and utilization of diagnostic knowledge. Diagnostic knowledge usually takes on two forms, domain-specific knowledge and procedural knowledge. <p> Two of the earliest Generic Tasks identified, and two of the most commonly used Generic Tasks, are Hierarchical Classification and Routine Recognition. Classification <ref> [4] </ref> is the task of generating a particular instance or subtype of a given type by searching through a taxonomic hierarchy. Input to the classification task is some description of the object/concept in question and output are the subclasses or instances which best fit the described case.
