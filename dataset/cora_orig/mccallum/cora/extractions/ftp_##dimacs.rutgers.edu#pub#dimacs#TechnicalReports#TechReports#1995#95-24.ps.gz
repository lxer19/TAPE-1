Reference-contexts: Let R [a; b] denote the smallest positive integer n such that every graph on n vertices contains either a clique of size a or an independent set of size b. Our work is motivated by the following results of Bacso and Tuza <ref> [1] </ref>, the first of which was proved independently by Cozzens and Kelleher [5]: Theorem 1 If G 2 Forb (P 5 ; C 5 ) is connected, then G has a dominating set D such that G D is a clique. 2 Theorem 2 If G 2 Forb (P 5 ) <p> The structure of the proof is modeled after the proof of Theorem 2 in <ref> [1] </ref>. One of the most powerful tools from that proof is the following lemma. If G is a graph and S is a cutset in V (G) such that S fxg N (x) for some x 2 S, then S is a star-cutset .

Reference-contexts: We will also discuss dominating sets which are "clique-like" in the sense that they have small independence number. (In a related direction, Bacso and Tuza have studied dominating sets with small diameter in <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], and [4].) Let be a class of graphs for which there exists a constant c such that every connected graph G 2 contains a dominating set D where (G D ) c. Then we will say is - dominated .

Reference-contexts: A similar result for cocomparability graphs follows from the fact that every connected cocom-parability graph has a dominating set which induces a chordless path (see <ref> [6] </ref>). Corollary 4 For all positive integers k and t there exists a function f k;t such that if G 2 Forb (P k ; H t ) is connected, then fl (G) f k;t (!(G)), where !(G) denotes the size of the largest clique in G. Proof.
