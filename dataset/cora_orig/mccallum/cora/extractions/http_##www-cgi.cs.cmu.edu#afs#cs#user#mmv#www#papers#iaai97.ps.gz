Abstract: Mixed-initiative planning envisions a framework in which automated and human planners interact to jointly construct plans that satisfy specific objectives. In this paper, we report on our work engineering a robust mixed-initiative planning system. Human planners rely strongly on past planning experience to generate new plans. ForMAT is a case-based system that supports human planning through the accumulation of user-built plans, query-driven browsing of past plans, and several plan functionality analysis primitives. Prodigy/Analogy is an automated AI planner that combines generative and case-based planning. Stored plans are annotated with plan rationale and reuse involves adaptation driven by this rationale. Our system, MI-CBP, integrates ForMAT and Prodigy/Analogy into a real-time message-passing mixed-initiative planning system. The main technical approach consists of allowing the user to specify and link objectives that enable the system to capture and reuse plan rationale. We present MI-CBP and its concrete application to the domain of military force deployment planning. This synergistic system increases the planning efficiency of human planners through automated suggestion of similar past plans and plausible plan modifications.

Reference-contexts: Learned knowledge is flexibly applied to new problem solving situations even if only a partial match exists among problems. Figure 1 illustrates the complete planning cycle of Prodigy/Analogy. Generative planning using the substrate operator-based planner, Prodigy4.0 <ref> (Carbonell et al. 1992) </ref>, is used if additional planning is needed when replaying the past planning cases. and storage of planning cases. An operator-based planner is used as a generative planner when additional planning is needed.

Reference-contexts: Derivational analogy is a reconstructive method by which lines of reasoning are transferred and adapted to a new problem <ref> (Carbonell 1986) </ref> as opposed to only the final solutions. Automatic generation of the derivational episodes that become the planning cases occurs by extending the base--level planner with the ability to examine its internal decision cycle, recording the justifications for each decision during its search process.

Reference-contexts: MI-CBP easily allows the introduction of new messages. It is the responsibility of each end system to generate the appropriate message processing modules. Research and Operational Issues Addressed The development of MI-CBP raised many research, engineering and operational issues. From a research perspective, the issues include (but see <ref> (Cox & Veloso 1997) </ref> for further details of the research issues): * Interpretation of user objectives and scenario into ratio nale and action models. * Under-specified goal statement from users: system plans for existentially quantified goal statements. * Users specify goals that are subgoals of other goals: planner focuses on higher-level <p> As an additional example, an unrestrained user will inevitably violate the tacit assumptions embedded in automated planners, such as the expectation that all input goals are top-level, grounded, state conditions. Prodigy/Analogy required significant control additions to manage such unexpected goal forms <ref> (Cox & Veloso 1997) </ref>. Furthermore, MI-CBP directly addresses several core issues of relevance to the integration of other systems, while other more detailed or application-dependent ones remain to be investigated. MI-CBP follows a disciplined approach, but maintains the user's flexibility and control.

Reference-contexts: MI-CBP is the result of a technology integration experiment (TIE) within the DARPA-supported Planning Initiative program <ref> (Tate 1996) </ref>. The TIE was established to explicitly provide mixed-initiative plan development and repair support to a force deployment user, using Prodigy/Analogy's rationale-supported replay and adaptation mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: To date the system contains 322 FM cases derived from 17 plans (TPFDDs). Ten of the plans were built through the reuse of FMs in the other plans. Prodigy/Analogy Prodigy is a planning and learning architecture <ref> (Veloso et al. 1995) </ref> where different machine learning techniques are developed for acquiring planning domain models, and control knowledge for improving efficiency in plan generation and plan quality.

Reference-contexts: Based on defined planning actions, it creates plans, interprets and stores planning episodes, and retrieves and reuses multiple past plans that are found similar to the new problem. Stored plans are annotated with plan rationale and reuse involves adaptation driven by the plan rationale <ref> (Veloso 1994a) </ref>. While the ForMAT system has been successfully used to develop deployment plans for military exercises and demonstrations, the developers have observed that better plans are generated by more experienced planners.
