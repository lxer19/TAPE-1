Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a high speed local area network operating at 100Mbps using fiber optic ring as transmission medium, developed under the auspices of ANSI X3T9.5 committee <ref> [1] </ref>. Because of such a high bandwidth, FDDI has become an attractive way to integrate variety of applications such as real-time voice, interactive data, image onto a single network.

Reference-contexts: FDDI uses an enhanced token ring protocol based on IEEE 802.5 token ring network called timed token medium access control (MAC) protocol <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. It supports two classes of service. The first class, synchronous, guarantees a fixed bandwidth and a maximum transmission delay to its users. That is why this class is very useful for real-time applications, which have stringent timing requirements and failure to meet deadline could be catastrophic. <p> The amount of time a node can keep the token, is governed by the Timed Token Protocol <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.2 Message Model Messages in the system can be of two types, synchronous or asynchronous. For simplicity we assume that there will be at most one synchronous message per station.

Reference-contexts: For hard realtime applications, the most important QOS is that the messages must be delivered before their deadlines. To guarantee delivery of messages before their deadlines, worst case end-to-end delay of cells should be known. Raha et. al. have shown a way of describing traffic for ATM network <ref> [4] </ref>. They have proposed a maximum rate (gamma) function to describe traffic and if a user can provide a maximum rate function for the input traffic, then the worst case end-to-end delay can be found out. <p> Raha et. al. have found expressions for the worst case end-to-end delay for an ATM network <ref> [4] </ref>. If we have to use a network like that shown in 6 figure 1 for a real-time application, then worst case delay across this kind of heterogeneous network has to be known. <p> Using the method given in <ref> [4] </ref> the worst case delay across ATM network can be found out. If we can come up with expressions for worst case delay across FDDI, token ring and ERD, then we can find the worst case end-to-end delay of this connection. <p> As described in section 2 , this model can be used to find out the worst case delay in the FDDI server part of the heterogeneous network. A similar model is already analyzed in <ref> [4] </ref> for ATM network. If similar models can be devised for other component of the heterogeneous network, then the entire heterogeneous network can be easily analyzed in a piecewise manner and hence end-to-end delay across any one or more components of the heterogeneous network can be found out.

Reference-contexts: They would want their ethernet, token ring or FDDI network to coexist with ATM network, so that the old applications can be used without modification. Hence came the necessity of LAN Emulator (LANE) [8, 9] and Edge Routing Device (ERD) <ref> [7] </ref>. The main function of LANE or ERD is to make the underlying ATM network transparent to the legacy network. To support real-time traffic for such a heterogeneous network, the worst case end-to-end delay should be known and now the connection can consist of variety of network.

Reference-contexts: for ERD, so that guarantee on a heterogeneous network like the one in figure 1, can be studied. 7 3 System Model This section describes the models used in various system components for our analysis. 3.1 Network Model The system model used for our analysis is similar to that of <ref> [10] </ref>. We consider the FDDI network to be consisting of n nodes connected by point to point links forming a ring. <p> This is a valid assumption, since an arbitrary token ring network where a node may have zero, one, or more streams of synchronous messages can be transformed into a logically equivalent network with one stream of synchronous messages per node <ref> [10] </ref>. Synchronous messages are periodic and deadline of synchronous message is the end of period. Messages are independent of each other. The length of a synchronous message S i is C i which is the maximum amount of time needed to transmit this message. <p> Let us consider a message that arrived at t, after t time units from t 0 . So this message must be transmitted before t + d i . From <ref> [10] </ref> we know that the total amount of time X i available for node i to transmit synchronous message in the period t + d i is bounded by 11 X i (b T T RT and the delay will be maximum when lower bound is tight. <p> Let us first prove equation 7. In a time interval t, the maximum number of packets that can arrive is t i in (t). The minimum amount of bandwidth available from the Timed Token Server, is given by (b t T T RT c 1)H i <ref> [10] </ref>. So the minimum number of packets served during time interval t is the minimum of the two, hence equation 7 follows. Maximum number of packets that can arrive in time interval (t + I) is (t + I) i in (t + I). <p> T T RT was taken to be 50. All the messages generated at a particular node were destined for one destination node. Destination node for a source node was chosen at random. 1 packet was taken 1 unit of time. A full length allocation scheme was implemented <ref> [10] </ref>. The simulator was run for three different configurations of messages. 5.1 Configuration 1 In this configuration, every node was allowed to have one stream of synchronous messages. The message lengths were randomly chosen and were between 2 to 5. There was no asynchronous message at any of the nodes.

Reference-contexts: The search space for t is bounded by the length of the busy interval B i . Hence equation 5 follows. 14 Equation 6 is the delay property of a gamma function that is proved in <ref> [11] </ref>. A trivial upper bound of i out (I) is 1, hence equation 4 follows. 5 Simulation A discrete event simulator for a FDDI network was built to verify the analytical results derived above. The simulator consists of 10 nodes with a ring length of 2:5 kilometers.
