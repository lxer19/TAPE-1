Title: Imitative Learning Mechanisms in Robots and Humans  
Author: John Demiris and Gillian Hayes 
Address: Edinburgh, UK  
Affiliation: Intelligent Robotics Group, Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of  
Abstract: We do not exist alone. Humans and most other animal species live in societies where the behaviour of an individual influences and is influenced by other members of the society. Within societies, an individual learns not only through classical conditioning and reinforcement, but to a large extent through observation and imitation. This paper presents an analysis of the problem of adding such imitative learning abilities to mobile robots and describes a biologically-inspired architecture we are developing for imitative learning. Our robotic testbed and learning experiments are described and discussed.

Reference-contexts: Other possibilities for learning by imitation include learning the meaning of certain words that are communicated between the agents, by associating the sounds that are communicated with the distance and angle to a food source that the teacher knows but the learner does not <ref> (Billard, 1996) </ref>. (Moukas and Hayes, 1996) report such experiments where the meaning of the words is communicated through a bee-like "dance" (a movement pattern). The learner then follows the teacher to a food source associating the distance and the angle from home with the visual language (the dance) perceived.

Reference-contexts: Once the face has been located, the part of the image that contains it is searched using template matching to locate the eyes, nostrils, and outer corners of the mouth. The facial normal is calculated using the planar method described in <ref> (Gee and Cipolla, 1994) </ref>. Thus we know the direction in which the face is looking with respect to the camera.

Symposium on Intelligent Robotic Systems, </booktitle> <pages> pages 198-204, </pages> <address> LIFIA-IMAG, Grenoble, France, </address> <month> July </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: In this section we present the experimental setup and describe these experiments. 3.2.1 Imitation of movements in 2D space In the experiments described in <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref> we investigated movement matching between a learner robot and a teacher robot moving on the floor of our lab. The learner matches the teacher's movements in order to learn how to traverse a maze. <p> For a detailed description of these experiments see <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref>. We are currently attempting to investigate how well this approach generalises in the more unconstrained environment of our lab having a human as the teacher to be followed. <p> This could cut-down the search space that an agent would need in order to learn these skills using reinforcement learning considerably. For example, our 2D movement matching experiments have shown <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref> that a robot can learn how to negotiate the different type of corners in a maze using imitation. The teacher robot knows how to deal with the different types of corners, while the learner one initially does not it merely knows how to imitate the teacher. <p> Kerstin Dautenhahn in (Dautenhahn, 1995) also presents a very interesting proposal: imitation as the basis for developing artificial social intelligence for autonomous robots. She uses imitation as a means of recognizing other robots and learning movement patterns. Her approach shares common ground with our work in <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref> in that the imitator first follows the demonstrator and then analyses the movement that it made in order to derive its conclusions.

Reference-contexts: expert could go on doing its tasks as usual and the learner could observe and imitate without interrupting the expert. * No explicit communication is needed between the robots, so this type of learning can still be used in situations where communication can be costly or dangerous or even impossible <ref> (Huber and Durfee, 1993) </ref>. In the next section we will review work done on imitation in natural systems including animals and humans.

Reference-contexts: Roboticists have spent a significant amount of time attempting to add learning abilities to robots. Till recently most of the techniques relied on individual learning, where an agent learns by acting on its environment and receiving reinforcement (notable exceptions include <ref> (Kuniyoshi, Inaba, and Inoue, 1994) </ref>, (Mataric, 1994) and (Munch et al, 1994)). In this paper we describe a novel approach to robot learning which complements existing robot learning approaches.

Reference-contexts: Recent experiments by developmental psychologists have challenged this account. Work by Meltzoff and his colleagues 1 has shown that infants are able to imitate a variety of facial and head movements <ref> (Meltzoff and Moore, 1989) </ref> very soon (minutes) after birth. Based on these experimental findings, Meltzoff postulated the existence of a mechanism, Active Intermodal Matching, which he argues underlies early infant imitation, and is present at birth.

Reference-contexts: We view imitation in natural and artificial systems as a process that involves three different issues: * The matching mechanism: How does an agent match actions perceived with equivalent ac tions of its own? 1 also replicated by several other researchers in a variety of experimental environments and conditions see <ref> (Meltzoff and Moore, 1992) </ref> for a complete list * How is the mechanism developed? What is its starting point, why does it change later, and how does it change? * How does the agent use this mechanism to refine/improve its behaviour/knowledge over time?

Like humans and other animals, robots could learn a significant amount of knowledge by observing and imitating other agents (humans or robots).

Reference-contexts: Humans are taken by default to be able to imitate and research is more concerned with when, why, and how they imitate. One of the most prominent theories on the development of imitative abilities is Piaget's, who advocated that the imitative ability develops in stages. According to his theory <ref> (Piaget, 1951) </ref>, infants begin their life being able to imitate behaviours where both the model's and the infant's action could be compared within the same sensory modality (for example, vocal imitation, or imitation of hand movements when their own hand is also visible).

Reference-contexts: Locating human faces in an unconstrained environment is a particularly hard problem and there have been several attempts at solving it including (Brunelli and Poggio, 1993) and (Sung and Poggio, 1994). We use a neural network approach very similar to the one described in <ref> (Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade, 1995) </ref> where a part of the image is classified as a face or a non-face after being preprocessed (to correct illumination) and resized to pass through the neural network filter.

Reference-contexts: Learning by imitation has certain desirable characteristics: * First of all, it speeds up the learning process. A robot could in principle, given sufficient time and energy, learn any task through reinforcement learning <ref> (Sutton, 1990) </ref>, but the presence of an "expert" could be utilised so that existing knowledge from that expert could be passed to the robot.

Reference-contexts: We are currently attempting to investigate how well this approach generalises in the more unconstrained environment of our lab having a human as the teacher to be followed. Since the problem of calculating the motion of an object when the observer is also moving is a difficult issue <ref> (Thompson and Pong, 1990) </ref> we have added bright LEDs on top of the teacher robot, which are tracked instead. The relationship between the two robots is one of distance. When the teacher robot moves this relationship is altered.
