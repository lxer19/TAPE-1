Reference-contexts: This in turn means that connectionist style networks, and even recurrent dynamical ones <ref> (Beer, 1990) </ref>, are generally very different kinds of systems from those that generate sophisticated adaptive behaviours in animals. Although our picture of biological neuronal networks changes every few years, contemporary neuroscience can provide a rich source of inspiration in devising alternative styles of artificial neural network (Brooks, 1991b).

Reference-contexts: These networks can be envisaged as simple nodes connected together by directional wires along which signals flow. As has been pointed out by various people <ref> (e.g. Brooks, 1994) </ref>, advances in neuroscience have made it clear that the propagation of action potentials, and the changing of synaptic connection strengths, is only a very small part of the story of the brain (e.g Purves, 1997).

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the connection segments scheme, which allows multiple connections to be made using a small number of variables, results in a slightly more amenable search space, possibly with less neutrality <ref> (Huynen et al., 1996) </ref>. A more detailed investigation of this point would have to be made before anything very concrete could be concluded. It should be noted that even without the gases active, the resultant heterogeneous networks are quite 1 Significance is shown for the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U analysis.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Jakobi has proposed new ways of thinking about and building fast-running easy-to-design minimal simulations for the evaluation of robot controllers. This methodology is described in detail elsewhere <ref> (Jakobi, 1998a, 1998b) </ref>, but since the experiments reported in this paper make extensive use of it, we offer a brief sketch here: 1. A small base set of robot-environment interactions that are sufficient to underly the behaviour we want to evolve must be identified and modelled. <p> half of the evaluations and zero on the other half. 4.2.4 Experimental Investigations Early exploratory experiments with GasNets (Husbands, 1998; Jakobi, Husbands and Smith, 1998) on the gantry robot target discrimination task suggested that GasNets evolved considerably faster (fewer 14 evaluations needed) than more conventional connectionist style networks used previously <ref> (Jakobi, 1998a) </ref>. In order to probe this tentative result further, the following experiments were performed: 1. Ten runs to evolve GasNet-based controllers for the gantry triangle/rectangle task using the connection segments connectivity scheme (section 4.2.1). 2. <p> Therefore, before dwelling on the outcome of various GasNet runs, results of previous evolutionary experiments with this robot task are outlined. 5.1 Previous results Jakobi had originally run the same experiment using two different styles of node and connection type networks <ref> (Jakobi 1998a, 1998b) </ref>. He did a series of runs with simple binary networks consisting of nodes connected together by weighted links. Each unit used the transfer function given in equation 10. O j is the output of the jth node and T j is its threshold.

Reference-contexts: Any node that falls within a negative segment has an inhibitory (-1 weighting) link made to it from the segment's parent node. If the segments intersect, nodes lying in the intersection will have both excitatory and inhibitory links made to them. described in <ref> (Jakobi, 1998b) </ref>. This time x; y coordinate points are used to define node connectivity. Each node has four outgoing connections, two excitatory and two inhibitory. Two variables (x; y), specify each link, defining the centre of a circle on the network plane.

Reference-contexts: visually guided behaviours, but is probably best thought of as if it were a two wheeled mobile robot with a fixed forward facing video camera mounted on top. 4.1 The Task A task was chosen for which we already had results from various evolutionary experiments with different styles of networks <ref> (Jakobi et al, 1998) </ref>. This would allow direct comparison of the performance of the GasNets with more conventional connectionist nets. A further aim was to compare runs with and without the gas modulation effects active. The main dimension of comparison was number of evaluations needed until highly fit controllers emerged. <p> A simple direct encoding was used for the veto networks (Cliff, Harvey and Husbands, 1993). Again, the size and topology of the networks was under evolutionary control as was the visual morphology. Also in this case, about 6,000 generations were required to successfully evolve reliable robust veto net controllers <ref> (Jakobi, Husbands and Smith, 1998) </ref>. An example is shown in figure 8. 16 5.2 GasNet Results Many of the early exploratory GasNet runs produced successful controllers in less than 500 generations and they rarely needed more than 1,000 generations (Jakobi, Husbands and Smith, 1998). <p> generations were required to successfully evolve reliable robust veto net controllers <ref> (Jakobi, Husbands and Smith, 1998) </ref>.

The bottom right-hand corner subnetwork, built from units 6 and 7, `switches' into a particular extremely stable state, if and only if the robot scans visually across the triangle.

Reference-contexts: Successful evolved GasNet controllers for the target discrimination task have all been structurally simple and have employed very low bandwidth sensing. These two factors have greatly helped in facilitating straightforward analysis. The mathematics of discrete dynamical systems <ref> (J. Sandefur, 1990) </ref> has proved a very useful framework for understanding the intrinsic properties of GasNets in detail, here only a brief qualitative analysis will be given. The following paragraphs summarise an analysis of the controller shown in figure 10.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, this allows the sensorimotor control network to dynamically adapt its own weights to its current context. This allows a richer class of adaptations than is possible with more standard connectionist architectures. The work of Beer and his students <ref> (e.g. Yamauchi and Beer, 1994) </ref> should be mentioned as providing a number of examples of robot controllers whose adaptivity is a results of the intrinsic dynamics of evolved recurrent dynamic ANNs rather than of an imposed adaptive mechanism in the network.
