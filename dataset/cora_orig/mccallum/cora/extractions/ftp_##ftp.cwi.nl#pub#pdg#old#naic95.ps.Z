Abstract: In this paper we present a novel theory of nonmonotonic temporal reasoning. It is related to approaches based on causation, the main difference being that in our approach causal relations take a context argument which indicates under what circumstances they should hold. Our theory can handle a very broad class of temporal reasoning problems. It provides an intuitively satisfying account of persistence: a property of the world persists iff for every circumstance that would cause it to change, that circumstance is (provably) not the case. Furthermore, our theory clarifies the relations between several different existing approaches. We identify two central issues which any theory of action, causal or not, somehow must address. The method has been proven correct relative to a `trajectory' semantics defining a certain class of problems including non-deterministic actions. But it also handles a wide variety of problems that fall outside the scope of these semantics, such as causal chains of events, preconditions and ramifications involving several points in time and explanation problems with incomplete knowledge of actions.

Reference-contexts: For example, the well-known approach to the YSP of Baker's <ref> [Bak91] </ref> fails on problems of this sort (Actually, the example involving a non-deterministic action of the previous section can be seen as a special case of this). <p> In fact one may say that our approach unifies, subsumes and corrects the causal approaches of Lifschitz [Lif87], Haugh [Hau87], Morgenstern and Stein [MS88] and Geffner (e.g. [Gef90]). It is also strongly related to (and is more general than) the quite well-known approach of Baker <ref> [Bak91] </ref> that is implicitly based on counterfactual reasoning. Practically all of the problems with the causal approaches and the one of Baker's can be explained by observing that they either neglect or handle incorrectly the first, the second or both of the issues mentioned in section 3.

Reference-contexts: Outline of a causal theory of action We now give an informal introduction to the theory we will develop. The basic idea can already be found in the various previous causal approaches <ref> [Gef90, Hau87, Lif87, LR89, MS88] </ref>; we only work it out in a very different way. <p> In fact one may say that our approach unifies, subsumes and corrects the causal approaches of Lifschitz [Lif87], Haugh [Hau87], Morgenstern and Stein [MS88] and Geffner (e.g. <ref> [Gef90] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Among other things, this means we must 1. not be misled by contingent observations and 2. know for all changes in each possible model whether they are caused or not. We have shown <ref> [GGB95] </ref> that these two issues form a theme of recurrent difficulties in a wide range of seemingly different theories of action, including some that are not explicitly based on causation at all: practically all problems that are associated with existing approaches can be seen to stem from neglecting the first, the <p> a circumstance under which the fluent changes and there is one under which it does not; if a toss occurs in S i and we do not know about Holds (Heads; S i+1 ) beforehand, we cannot infer anything about it. 5 What classes of problems do we handle? In <ref> [GGB95] </ref> the full strength of our approach is demonstrated in detail by comparing it to other approaches and showing how it unifies their basic ideas while solving their difficulties. <p> In fact, it can do much more. For the following classes of problems no definition of their semantics in terms of a simple formal system exists (yet), so we cannot give any proofs here. In <ref> [GGB95] </ref> we show by some typical examples that our theory yields the intuitively expected conclusions in the following cases: Actions with preconditions that involve several points in time and not only the one at which the action they qualify is performed.

Reference-contexts: Nondeterministic actions are allowed too, so we proved something stronger than the more common assessment in terms of the semantics of the language A <ref> [GL92, Kar93] </ref>. Notice however that this assessment proof only provides a lower bound on the power of our theory. In fact, it can do much more.

Reference-contexts: However, already for some very simple reasoning problems the method described above does not work, as was shown through the YSP in <ref> [HM86] </ref>, of which we now give a simple version: suppose we have, in addition to ( 1), the following axioms: Holds (Loaded; Result (Load; s)) (if you load a gun it will be loaded afterwards), Holds (Alive; S 0 ) (in the initial situation S 0 Fred is alive) and :Holds

Reference-contexts: Section 5 summarizes the classes of problems for which our theory works correctly and mentions previous approaches that are partly subsumed, partly corrected by ours. The paper ends with some concluding remarks. 2 Effect axioms and the situation calculus Let us start by briefly reviewing the situation calculus <ref> [MH69] </ref>. The situation calculus is a formalism for temporal reasoning within sorted first order predicate calculus. The sorts are situations, fluents and actions. Objects of a sort will be denoted by the first letter of the sort; capitals will be used for constants, small letters for variables. <p> performing the action Shoot in any situation in which the gun is loaded will result in a situation in which Fred is not alive any more, we can do so by the following effect axiom 1 : Holds (Loaded; s) :Holds (Alive; Result (Shoot; s)) (1) Now the frame problem <ref> [MH69] </ref> is the problem of how to express that fluents not affected by such effect axioms tend to keep their values from one situation to the next.

Reference-contexts: a short summary here, leaving out most of the explanations and arguments: Strength Assessment We have proved a theorem stating that our theory works correctly relative to a certain formally defined class of problems, more specifically the `KIbsA family of chronicles' as defined in a recent book by Erik Sandewall <ref> [San94] </ref>. Roughly speaking this means that our approach is guaranteed to work well for problems in which actions happen only one at a time, all actions that happen are known to do so, results of actions may depend on preconditions and no surprises occur. <p> As for other popular approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning about action: chronological minimization [Sho88] does not work very well unless enhanced with filter preferential entailment <ref> [San94] </ref>. Our approach makes intuitively clear why this extension makes things work.

Reference-contexts: Then both the model in which Holds (Loaded; S 2 ) and the one in which :Holds (Loaded; S 2 ) would be retained, and the YSP would reappear. Non-deterministic Actions It is not clear how to represent non-deterministic actions in simple temporal formalisms <ref> [SS94] </ref>. Consider for instance the tossing of a coin. We would like to express that after performing Toss, we can have either Heads or Not (Heads), independent of whether we had Heads or Not (Heads) before the tossing (thus there is no persistence). <p> This would enable us to express effects of actions that take place at other times than directly after the action itself is performed. Also, it would render the representation of causal chains of events somewhat simpler. Other future work concerns the qualification problem <ref> [SS94] </ref> which we have not addressed in this paper. We are currently investigating how it fits within our framework.
