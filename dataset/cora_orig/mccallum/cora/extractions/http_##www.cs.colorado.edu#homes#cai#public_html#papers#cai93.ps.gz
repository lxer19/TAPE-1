Abstract: We consider the solution of linear systems of algebraic equations that arise from elliptic finite element problems. We study a two-level overlapping domain decomposition method that can be viewed as a combination of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods. This method combines the advantages of the two methods. It converges faster than the additive Schwarz algorithm and is more parallelizable than the multiplicative Schwarz algorithm, and works for general, not necessarily selfadjoint, linear, second order, elliptic equations. We use the GMRES method to solve the resulting preconditioned linear system of equations and we show that the algorithm is optimal in the sense that the rate of convergence is independent of the mesh size and the number of subregions in both R 2 and R 3 . A numerical comparison with the additive and multiplicative Schwarz preconditioned GMRES is reported.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. Domain decomposition technique is a class of preconditioned iterative methods for solving partial differential equations and has been proved to be very effective for parallel computing. In this paper, we study a new class of methods based on the Dryja-Widlund decomposition <ref> [7] </ref>, in which the usual finite element space is optimally decomposed into the sum of a finite number of uniformly overlapped two-level subspaces. Based on this decomposition two methods, the additive Schwarz (ASM) [3, 5, 7] and the multiplicative Schwarz methods (MSM) [2, 6], have been studied. <p> In this paper, we study a new class of methods based on the Dryja-Widlund decomposition [7], in which the usual finite element space is optimally decomposed into the sum of a finite number of uniformly overlapped two-level subspaces. Based on this decomposition two methods, the additive Schwarz (ASM) <ref> [3, 5, 7] </ref> and the multiplicative Schwarz methods (MSM) [2, 6], have been studied. A recent paper [4] shows that MSM, despite of its less parallelism, is substantially faster than ASM in terms of their algebraic convergence rates. <p> We solve equation (1) by the Galerkin conformal finite element method. For simplicity, we use piecewise linear triangular elements in R 2 and the corresponding tetrahedral elements in R 3 . Following Dryja and Widlund <ref> [7] </ref>, we describe a two-level triangulation of and the corresponding finite element spaces. We define f i ; i = 1; ; N g to be a shape regular finite element triangulation of , where the diameter of i is of order O (H).

Reference-contexts: The main difference between the new method and MSM is the treatment of the coarse grid operator. There are other recently developed iterative methods that make special use of the coarse grid operator; see e.g. <ref> [1, 11, 12] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. In x 2, we briefly introduce the elliptic finite element problem and the Dryja-Widlund decomposition. Then, we discuss the idea of transformed systems with certain well-known examples in x 3.
