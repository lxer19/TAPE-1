Abstract: An interactive puzzlesolving program was implemented in two versions both permitting two players to cooperate in solving the puzzle. In one version, the users were permitted not only to individually pick up and place pieces into the puzzle but also to jointly pick up and position pieces with synchronous cooperative control of the piece. In the other version, the synchronous cooperative control was disabled. We present the rationale for cooperative control, the design of the puzzle activities, the results of user testing, and displays of the interaction histories for the activities. We found that although the cooperative control of pieces was more difficult than individual control, half of the users preferred the cooperative control - a testimony to the added social value of cooperative controls in user interfaces.

Reference-contexts: Actions performed on one object may affect the state of other objects in the constraint based on the definition of their relationship. In the puzzle activity, we use one-way constraints <ref> [Bharat95] </ref>, which means that the input objects may have an effect on the output objects, but not vice-versa. For example, lets look again at the cooperative control of a square by a line segment, as presented in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: The users are simultaneously defining the midpoint or centroid of a geometric object in a tightly integrated manner. 2.2 Project Background CoImage is an application shell which contains a number of collaborative activities, including the Image Warper <ref> [Bricker96] </ref>, a drawing activity reminiscent of the Etch-a-sketch TM toy, an image transformer, and the puzzle activity which is described below. 4 CoImage and the activities it contains were created using a hierarchy of objects, called CO-API, that facilitate the development of collaborative activities.

Reference-contexts: Like CSILE, these activities demonstrate a degree of fine-grained sharing since users are editing different parts of a document, but unlike CSILE, these activities are designed for a more synchronous distance situation in which users are working on the document at the same time. The Color Matcher activity <ref> [Bricker95] </ref> demonstrates fine-grained sharing in a synchronous activity where all of the users are co-located (in fact, using the same computer with a multiple mouse input device). <p> This activity encourages a level of communication among users (about relative amounts of color, and about the additive color system in general) which is not facilitated in a single-user version of the program or in a distance situation. The Midpoint activity <ref> [Bricker95] </ref> was designed to encourage communication about geometric concepts. In two player mode, the players are charged with matching the midpoint of a line segment to a point on the screen. Each user has control of one endpoint of the line segment.

Reference-contexts: GroupKit [Roseman92] is a toolkit designed to speed the development of multiuser applications for distance collaboration. This toolkit was used to create a group sketchpad and a text editing program <ref> [Gutwin95] </ref> in which multiple cursors are used to support awareness of other users. Application designers are given control over how closely the multiple views are tied together, i.e., when or how often synchronization points occur.

Reference-contexts: One could also develop new and interesting ways to cooperatively control an object. For instance, we would like to implement an interaction technique that could be termed a herding stick that is based on a technique which uses a stick-like tool to align objects in a drawing program <ref> [Roope96] </ref>. In the puzzle activity, the herding stick could be used to move puzzle pieces or groups of puzzle pieces around the screen, and even to rotate the pieces. Two users could control the stick by each manipulating one end of the stick, as seen in Figure 9.

Reference-contexts: This system is designed to accommodate distance collaboration ranging from individuals in a classroom to individuals in different geographic locations. The interactions are asynchronous, but might be considered fine-grained sharing in the sense that they are manipulating parts of a larger whole, the knowledge base itself.

This toolkit was used to create a group sketchpad and a text editing program [Gutwin95] in which multiple cursors are used to support awareness of other users.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of control dimension ranges from no control to very complex, integrated constraint-based control. Finally, the distance dimension is a measure of the physical 3 distance between participants in the collaboration. The following collaborative systems demonstrate some of the variation that exists in sharing methods. CSILE <ref> [Scardamalia94] </ref> is a collaborative system designed to support knowledge-building communities by encouraging alternative discourse patterns that lend themselves to building knowledge. Users produce materials, including textual and graphical notes, and contribute to a database which other users can search, comment on, or organize into more complex informational structures.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen to take advantage of the familiar structure of the puzzle activity itself in order to represent the data, based on a visualization principle presented in Envisioning Information <ref> [Tufte90] </ref>. Each puzzle piece is colored according to some statistic. We chose to use a value scale because value is a dimension of color that is relatively easy to perceive [Tufte90]. <p> of the puzzle activity itself in order to represent the data, based on a visualization principle presented in Envisioning Information <ref> [Tufte90] </ref>.

Figure A3 in Appendix A depicts a visualization of the interaction totals for each puzzle piece, the brightest puzzle piece being the most active one. Here, each interaction corresponds to a selection, translation, or rotation. We can see from this image where the hot spots in the puzzle were.
