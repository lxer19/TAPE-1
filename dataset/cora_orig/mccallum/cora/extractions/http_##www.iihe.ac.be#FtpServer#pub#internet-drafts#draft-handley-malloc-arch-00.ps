Reference-contexts: This architecture assumes that the primary scoping mechanism in use is administrative scoping. While solutions that work for TTL scoping are possible <ref> [1] </ref>, they introduce significant additional complication for address allocation.

Reference-contexts: In summary, tolerating the possibility of clashes is likely to allow allocation of a very high proportion of the address space in the presence of network conditions such as those observed in <ref> [2] </ref>. We believe that we can get good packing and good availability with very good collision avoidance, while we would have to compromise packing and availability significantly to avoid all collisions. Address Dynamics Multicast addresses may be statically allocated or dynamically allocated.
