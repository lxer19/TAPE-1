Reference-contexts: The algorithms implemented by the service is based on a master-slave scheme. The time daemons communicate with each other using the Time Synchronization Protocol (TSP) which is built on the DARPA UDP protocol and described in detail in <ref> [4] </ref>. A time daemon has a twofold function. First, it supports the synchronization of the clocks of the various hosts in a local area network. Second, it starts (or takes part in) the election that occurs among slave time daemons when, for any reason, the master disappears.
