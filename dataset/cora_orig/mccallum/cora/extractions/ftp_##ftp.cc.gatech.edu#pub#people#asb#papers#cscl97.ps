Abstract: MOOSE Crossing is a text-based virtual reality environment (or MUD) designed to give children eight to thirteen years old a meaningful context for learning reading, writing, and computer programming. It is used from home, in after-school programs, and increasingly as an in-school activity. To date, it has been used in five classrooms. This paper compares its use in three of those classrooms, and analyzes factors that made use of MOOSE Crossing more and less successful in each of these contexts. Issues highlighted include access to computers, existence of peer experts, freeform versus structured activity, and school atmosphere.

Reference-contexts: This paper compares the use of one CSCL environment, MOOSE Crossing, in three classrooms. MOOSE Crossing's effectiveness as a learning environment is evaluated in <ref> (Bruckman 97) </ref>. This paper highlights issues which have emerged from its classroom use. At the time of this writing, MOOSE Crossing has been used as an organized activity in five classrooms in four schools, located in three states. <p> While MOOSE Crossing is a network-based learning environment which facilitates collaboration within the online environment, the details of its implementation in a particular classroom are still of central significance to the activitys success. Faceto-face collaboration within a classroom and collaboration online are complementary <ref> (Bruckman 1997) </ref>. This paper will focus in particular on issues of access, existence of peer experts, freeform versus structured activity, and atmosphere. 1.1 Background: The MOOSE Crossing Project MOOSE Crossing is a text-based virtual reality environment (or MUD) designed to be a constructionist learning environment for children eight to thirteen. <p> MOOSE Crossing is distinguished from other MUDs for kids in the new technology developed and the strength of its underlying educational philosophy. It includes a new programming language (MOOSE) and client interface (MacMOOSE) designed to make it easier for children to learn to program <ref> (Bruckman 1997) </ref>. On MOOSE Crossing, children construct a virtual world together, making new places and objects that have behaviors. They also construct fanciful personas for themselves. <p> The community is a ready source not just of project models for children to learn from, but also of role models for them to emulate. The networked environment provides a context for children to support one anothers progress in learning reading, writing, and computer programming <ref> (Bruckman 1997) </ref>. MOOSE Crossing was originally designed to be used from home and after-school programs. To our surprise, it has proved particularly popular for classroom use. Currently, 40% of participants connect from school, compared to 45% from home and 15% from after-school programs. <p> online (recorded with permission from both parents and children.) While what is presented here is not detailed enough to qualify as a thick description (Geertz 1973), our observations are supported by a significant body of data 1 . 1 A more detailed account of learning on MOOSE Crossing appears in <ref> (Bruckman 1997) </ref>. 2.1 California Public The class from California Public is a combined 4th and 5th grade class of approximately sixty students, with two teachers and a teachers aide. The classroom itself is large, and is divided in half by a large archway.

Reference-contexts: The students have developed a positive interdependence, learning in a collaborative fashion (Johnson and Johnson 1994). The group project scaffolded the learning experience <ref> (Guzdial 1994) </ref>. The children had time to work on self-selected projects, in addition to working on their part of the class project. The teacher has established an effective compromise between freeform and structured activity.

Reference-contexts: As Kolodner and Guzdial have noted, Although its not clear if CSCL prompts changes in school structure or if changes from traditional school structure are needed for CSCL to succeed, it is clear that the two must at least be developed hand in hand <ref> (Kolodner and Guzdial 1996) </ref>. Acknowledgments Rick Borovoy and Mitchel Resnick gave helpful comments on drafts of this paper. The authors would also like to thank the teachers and students who have participated in the MOOSE Crossing project.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction What factors make ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) <ref> (Koschmann 1996) </ref> environments succeed in classroom use? What factors make them fail? The success of a CSCL environment depends not just on the software, but on the context in which that software is used. This paper compares the use of one CSCL environment, MOOSE Crossing, in three classrooms.

Reference-contexts: The class project was well chosen. As Oday et al note, the activity chosen needs to work well within the affordances of a MUD environment <ref> (Oday 97) </ref>. The kids are clearly enthusiastic about their MOOSE Crossing time; they begin the session by excitedly planning the days work with Mrs. Jay, then break up to work on their own computers.
