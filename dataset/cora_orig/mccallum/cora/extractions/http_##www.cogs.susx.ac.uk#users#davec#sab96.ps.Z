Abstract: Co-evolution of Pursuit and Evasion II: Simulation Methods and Results fl Abstract In a previous SAB paper [10], we presented the scientific rationale for simulating the coevolution of pursuit and evasion strategies. Here, we present an overview of our simulation methods and some results. Our most notable results are as follows. First, co-evolution works to produce good pursuers and good evaders through a pure bootstrapping process, but both types are rather specially adapted to their opponents' current counter-strategies. Second, eyes and brains can also co-evolve within each simulated species for example, pursuers usually evolved eyes on the front of their bodies (like cheetahs), while evaders usually evolved eyes pointing sideways or even backwards (like gazelles). Third, both kinds of coevolution are promoted by allowing spatially distributed populations, gene duplication, and an explicitly spatial morphogenesis program for eyes and brains that allows bilateral symmetry. The paper concludes by discussing some possible applications of simulated pursuit-evasion coevolu tion in biology and entertainment.

Reference-contexts: Small amounts of random noise were also added onto the values of v l and v r , so that movement was nondeterministic. 2.2 The Neuron Model We used continuous-time recurrent neural networks of a type which have recently been the subject of detailed analysis (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: But most interestingly, it is possible for a unit to be both sensory and motor. This capability, coupled with the relative ease of generating bilaterally symmetric designs, means that random genotypes often encode simple but very effective Braitenberg-Vehicle-like controller architectures (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>). Almost equally as often, random designs may have no motor outputs, no sensory inputs, or no connection between sensors and motors.

Reference-contexts: Finally, each field contains a sequence of bits that can specify symmetric expression: if a neuron is expressed symmetrically, then a copy is created by reflecting the neuron's body and input and output trees about the animat's longitudinal axis. Full details of the encoding scheme are given in <ref> [3] </ref>. This encoding scheme has proven to offer considerable power. It allows for some units in the network to be "hidden"(cf. interneurons), others to be sensory input neurons, and others to be motor output neurons. But most interestingly, it is possible for a unit to be both sensory and motor.

The controller-network is encoded as strings of binary digits (bits). Rather than use variable-length genotypes to allow varying numbers of units in the networks (e.g. [4]), we use fixed-length genotypes, partitioned into a number of `fields'. At the start of each field is a sequence of bits which governs whether that field is `expressed' - i.e. whether it is ignored or read to form part of the specification for the network.

Our work in this area continues. 5 Conclusions This paper has described our methods and presented tiny cross-sections of data from the torrent of megabytes that a complex co-evolutionary simulation can generate. But most of what we've learned from this project can't be expressed in numbers.

Reference-contexts: Hence, one possibility is that we use our simulator for studying visually guided pursuit behavior in animals. Such behavior has been studied extensively in the biology literature. One system particularly well understood at the neural level is chasing behavior in house-flies (see e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>). If we attempt to evolve pursuer animats with fly-like dynamics, which produce fly-like behaviors, we may learn more about real flies. Before such work can commence, it is likely to be necessary to make the (visual) environment more challenging.

In brief, the intellectual background for our work stems from the observation that animals survive and reproduce by exploiting "fitness affordances" <ref> [11] </ref> in their environment, and that some of these affordances are themselves mobile animals that do not want to be exploited (e.g. prey, coy females, hosts avoiding parasites).

The final fitness of the individual was calculated as the mean fitness score from the set of trials.

Furthermore, in many species of prey (i.e. evader) animals, there are often three distinct phases to an encounter with a predator (i.e. pursuer) animal. At first the prey will be vigilant, conserving energy.
