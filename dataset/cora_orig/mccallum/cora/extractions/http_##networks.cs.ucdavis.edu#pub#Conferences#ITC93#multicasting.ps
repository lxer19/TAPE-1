Abstract: Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a technique used to divide the tremendous optical bandwidth of a fiber into many non-interfering channels. A WDM single-hop local lightwave network can be designed by using two-way fibers to connect every station to a passive star coupler, and equipping the stations with tunable transmitters and receivers. When a station needs to transmit data, it tunes a transmitter to a free wavelength on its outgoing fiber and begins sending the packet. The passive star receives the packet and broadcasts it, via each station's incoming fiber, on that wavelength. Any station that needs to receive the packet, must tune a receiver to the proper wavelength at the proper time. This type of network design is known as broadcast and select. Intuitively, broadcast and select networks are naturally suited to multicasting; every station in the network has the opportunity to receive any particular packet. However, as of the time of this writing, no other work has studied the performance of multicasting in a local lightwave network based on a passive star. In this study, we show how multicasting in a broadcast and select based environment can dramatically increase the utilization and throughput of the network. Using a Markov model and a simulation, we show that multicasting significantly improves the upper-bound performance of both small and large networks, especially when each station is equipped with multiple receivers. We evaluate each system by comparing throughput and blocking probability.

Reference-contexts: These wavelengths, otherwise known as channels, can operate at peak electronic speed, thus theoretically enabling an aggregate system capacity of several terabits per second [Good][Henr]. By equipping each station with tunable transmitters and receivers <ref> [Brac] </ref>, we can enable the stations to communicate with one another. 1.1 Types of WDM Local Lightwave Networks All WDM local lightwave networks can be categorized as either multihop or single hop. In a multihop network, each station is equipped with a number of fixed or slow tunable transceivers.

The broadcast-and-select variety of single hop networks is a natural candidate for multicasting. Multiple recipients can read the control information and data packets in parallel as easily as a single recipient.

Reference-contexts: If two particular stations do not share a common channel, they must communicate via one or more intermediate stations.

Refer to [Mukh2] for a comprehensive survey of multihop networks. A limitation of multihop networks is that at every hop electro-optical conversion must occur. This makes the cost of communication depend on the mean hop distance between stations.

Reference-contexts: This is so that all control information can be received and that data and control information may be transmitted concurrently. Our analysis assumes a distributed transmission protocol with no control overhead, as well as collision-less transmission and no propagation delay on the control channel. As in <ref> [LuKl] </ref>, these assumptions can be used to find an upper bound of the performance of a net-work. Arrivals are Poisson with packet arrivals per second at each each station. Packet transmission time is exponentially distributed with mean 1= seconds per packet. <p> Let P c (k) be the probability of finding a free channel in state k. Then, P c (k) = 1 if k &lt; W In <ref> [LuKl] </ref>, there is a novel method for finding the probability that a station has at least one free transmitter. Given the state of the system, k, if k &lt; t, then every station has at least one free transmitter. <p> While the receiver throughput to blocking probability ratio is higher for the system with two receivers per station, the receiver throughput will never exceed 10. We also tested a system with r = 3, and the results were identical to r = 2. This corresponds to the conclusions of <ref> [LuKl] </ref>, stating that a network will achieve its highest upper-bound performance with few transmitters and receivers per node. multicasting is allowed. We kept = 0:1 and instead varied L from 1 to 49.

In a broader sense, many-to-one and many-to-many connections are also categorized as multicasting, but they are not considered here.
