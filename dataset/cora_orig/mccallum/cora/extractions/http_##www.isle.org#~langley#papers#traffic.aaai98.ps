Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to traffic management by coordinating driver behaviors. Current traffic management systems do not consider lane organization of the cars and only affect traffic flows by controlling traffic signals or ramp meters. However, drivers can increase traffic throughput and more consistently maintain desired speeds by selecting lanes intelligently. We pose the problem of intelligent lane selection as a challenging and potentially rewarding problem for artificial intelligence, and we propose a methodology that uses supervised and reinforcement learning to form distributed control strategies. Initial results are promising and demonstrate that intelligent lane selection can achieve higher traffic throughput, maximize desired speeds, and reduce the total number of lane changes.

Reference-contexts: Removing these assumptions unnecessarily complicates the model, which creates unacceptable run times for exploratory research. In future work, we will expand our experiments to a more realistic simulator such as SmartPATH <ref> (Eskafi, 1996) </ref>. During training, the learning system uses the traffic simulator to evaluate candidate lane-selection strategies. Each evaluation or trial lasts 400 simulated seconds and begins with a random dispersement of 200 cars over three lanes on the 3.3 mile roadway.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the Bayesian Automated Taxi (BAT) project, an attempt to build a fully automated vehicle that can drive in normal traffic <ref> (Forbes, Huang, Kanazawa, & Russell, 1995) </ref>, will eventually contain a module for lane selection. Each of these systems were designed to maximize the performance of a single vehicle and do not form cooperative controllers. Our approach is directed at the global traffic management problem, where cooperation is important.

Reference-contexts: SANE maintains a population of possible strategies, evaluates the goodness of each from its performance in the domain, and uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate new strategies. The evolutionary algorithm modifies the strategies through genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation <ref> (Goldberg, 1989) </ref>. SANE represents its decision strategies as artificial neural networks that form a direct mapping from sensors to decisions and provide effective generalization over the state space.

Reference-contexts: These pairs denote examples of good behavior that can be fed to a supervised learning method to form initial strategies. Since SANE's strategies are represented as neural networks, the population seeder employs the backpropagation algorithm <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) </ref> to train the networks over the training examples. To maintain diversity within the initial population of neural networks and not overly bias SANE toward the rules of thumb, only a subset of the networks are seeded using the default knowledge.

Reference-contexts: A negative training signal in the previous example would generate a target output of (1.0, 0.0, 1.0), and the resulting network would be less likely to choose change left in similar situations. The learning strategy is somewhat similar to the temporal difference methods for reinforcement learning <ref> (Sutton, 1988) </ref>, in that updates are made based on the performance differences over successive time periods. However, temporal difference methods treat performance differences as prediction errors from which they can learn to predict future rewards.
