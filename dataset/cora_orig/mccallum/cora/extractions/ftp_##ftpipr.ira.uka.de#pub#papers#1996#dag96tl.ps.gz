Abstract: During the last years, the need for large and complex technical systems has become obvious. Examples are manufacturing cells, transport systems consisting of many vehicles, or robots working together to reach a common goal. As a consequence, the control architectures for these systems are not longer able to guarantee the well known properties of modularity, fault-tolerance, integrability and extendibility. On that account, the former centralized architectures are often replaced by distributed control mechanisms. During the last three years, the University of Karlsruhe has developed an infrastructure for distributed robot systems. This way, the problems of communication, coordination and cooperation between the system components, the task allocation, optimization and deadlock-avoidance are managed by the architecture KAMARA (KArlsruher Multi Agent Robot Architecture) itself. Using these concepts, the planning system for the Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot KAMRO was realized in a very short time. To prove the general use of the infrastructure, the control architecture for the microrobots MINIMAN is being developed at IPR by use of these new concepts. One robot consists of two manipulators driven by three piezoactuators, and it can move by use of three piezolegs. In the application field of these robots (medicine, biology and chip production), it is often necessary that the microrobots cooperate to perform difficult tasks. Due to the complexity of the system, the interactions between the robots, and the possibility of deadlocks during the task allocation, the KAMARA architecture was used to solve these problems in an efficient way. In this paper, the results of the work and some experiments with the new system are described.

Reference-contexts: After that, in section five, the application of KAMARA concepts for the Micro-Robotics system is discussed in detail. There, conceivable applications using a multi-agent microrobot system are presented. The article ends with a conclusion for future work. 2 Agent Model and Communication Mechanism The multi-agent-architecture KAMARA <ref> [1] </ref> developed in Karlsruhe is used as an infrastructure to provide the comfortable realizing of distributed control architectures for complex inhomogeneous systems. The agents in KAMARA negotiate for the processing of the task execution according to an extended Control-Net-Protocol through a common communication channel, the missionboard.

Reference-contexts: Because special agents change the structure of the control architecture while they are active, they should only be used if no other type of cooperation is suitable. 2.3 Agent Model for Multi-Agent Robot System Normally a multi-agent robot system consists of some types of components, i.e. sensors, controllers and actuators <ref> [2] </ref>. The flexibility to use sensors and actuators in different ways is a precondition for the flexible use of robot systems. In addition, to flexibly control the robot system, it must also be possible to change control loops among environment 6 quantifier and environment changer during operation.

Reference-contexts: Deadlocks caused by agent-teams: For the team cooperation, there are two kinds of dependence between the agents. The weakness dependence permits the agents to work on other tasks when they are waiting for the results of their initial task, that means, they explicitly admit the parallel idea presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. The stouts dependence emphasizes that, once the dependence is demanded, the agent body cannot be released to work on any other tasks. In following, teams with weakness dependence are referred to as the first class and the ones with stouts dependence are referred to as the second class.

Reference-contexts: By bending the legs and performing microsteps, the piezoelectric actuators make it possible to move the robot at relatively high speeds (up to 3 cm/sec), but also with a high position resolution of up to 20 nm. The movement principle was presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. The robot is capable of performing manipulations with 14 Platform movement Leg movement Piezoelectric legs Robot platform two needle-like manipulators mounted on spherical tool holders (which can be seen in Fig. 8, right). These manipulators are also driven by piezoactuators similar to the robots legs.

Reference-contexts: All microscope parameters, such as lighting, objective change and the position of the glass base can be controlled with a computer which also performs image recognition to provide a closed control loop for the microrobot under the microscope. A detailed description of the micromanipulation station can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. F i g . 8 : The micro-robot MINIMAN (upside-down, right) and its motion principle (left) 5.2 Applications There are numerous applications for such a micromanipulation system. They can be roughly divided into two groups: biological and technical applications. The biological applications concern the handling of cells.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the stubborn question still remains how to describe the tasks so that they can be solved locally. 3.2 Task Description A very powerful solution, proposed here, is the description of a task as a free optimization of a unimodal function <ref> [13] </ref>. The function defines for each achievable environment state a distance (metric) to the optimum in the environment space and can be optimized by environment changes. Unimodal functions can be locally optimized and easily generated by training, stochastic processes or described by a few parameters on similar metrics.

Reference-contexts: The detailed description of the semantic grounging of these terms and its correspondance to other approaches can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. The agents which are required to cooperate for a task are usually constituted in an agent team. In these cases, the communication for the cooperation is carried out on the missionboard and, however, the agents process on the tasks independently. <p> Therefore, the agent cooperation of the system and the management of resources must be organized in such a way that even in the superposition of interaction spaces a deadlock-free system is guaranteed <ref> [14] </ref>. 4.1 Causes of Deadlocks Deadlocks can arise because of the cooperation and coordination among the agents in the multi-agent system: Deadlocks caused by agent bodies / external resources: Deadlocks are disagreeable if they are involved in the agent bodies and the external resources, because they concern two areas of resources <p> Dynamic Effects: To deal with the dynamic effects on the external resources, a suitable deadlock-free administration which is used for the procedure of simultaneous or successive allocation, can meet with the system.
