Abstract: We discuss a model for the evolutionary distance between two coding DNA sequences which specializes to the DNA/protein model proposed in Hein [4]. We discuss the DNA/protein model in details and present a quadratic time algorithm that computes an optimal alignment of two coding DNA sequences in the model under the assumption of affine gap cost. The algorithm solves a conjecture in [4] and we believe that the constant factor of the running time is sufficiently small to make the algorithm feasible in practice.

The models discussed in these papers are inspired by the DNA/protein model in Hein [4, 6] but differ in the interpretation of gap cost. A heuristic algorithm for solving the alignment problem in the DNA/protein model is described In Hein [5].

Reference-contexts: Since we only consider a constant number of possible codon alignments (e.g. the types in Fig. 7) this implies that we can compute D (n; m) in time O (nm) and space O (n). By adapting the technique in Hirschberg [7] or the variant described in Durbin et al. <ref> [2, Page 35-36] </ref> we can also get the optimal alignment (and not only the cost) within the same time and space bound.

Reference-contexts: A codon alignment of type 2 or type 3 describes a gap between codons. Since the combined gap cost function is affine we can use the technique introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> saying that a gap ending in (i; j) is either a continuation of an existing gap ending in (i 1; j) or (i; j 1), or the start of a new gap.

In Sect. 3 we describe how to determine the cost of an alignment. In Sect. 4 we present the simple alignment algorithm of Hein <ref> [4] </ref>. In Sect. 5 we present a quadratic time alignment algorithm. <p> The choice of evolutionary events and cost function influences both the biological relevance of the distance measure and the computational complexity of computing the distance. 2.2 The specific model The DNA/protein model introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> can be described as an instance of the general model where the evolution of coding DNA is idealized to involve only substitutions of single nucleotide and insertion-deletions of a multiple of three consecutive nucleotides. <p> In the DNA/protein model the cost of an event is the sum of the DNA level cost and the protein level cost. We observe that the DNA level cost of a sequence of events is independent of the order but that the protein level cost is not <ref> [4, Fig. 2] </ref>. This implies that we cannot use a classical alignment algorithm to compute an optimal alignment in the DNA/protein model. <p> A nucleotide event thus changes protein A = U XV to protein A 0 = U X 0 V where X and X 0 are the amino acids affected by nucleotide event. Let us consider the protein level cost dist p (A; A 0 ) of the event. Hein <ref> [4] </ref> implicitly assumes that dist p (A; A 0 ) is the cost of a distance alignment of X and X 0 with the minimum number of insertion-deletions. <p> The protein level cost of an alignment can thus be determined in time proportional to the number of codon alignments in the decomposition of the alignment. In Hein <ref> [4] </ref> at most one insertion or one deletion is allowed between two consecutive substitutions in a codon alignment. <p> The eleven types of codon alignments with at most one inseriton or one deletion between two consecutive substitutions. 4 A simple alignment algorithm Let a 1 a 2 a 3n and b 1 b 2 b 3m be two coding sequences of DNA. Hein <ref> [4] </ref> describes how the decomposition into codon alignments makes it possible to compute the cost of an optimal alignment of a and b in the DNA/protein model in time O (n 2 m 2 ).

The heuristic algorithm allows frame shifts, so an obvious extension of our exact algorithm would be to allow frame shifts, e.g. to allow insertion-deletions of arbitrary length. This however makes it difficult to split the evaluation of the alignment cost into small independent subproblems (codon alignments) of known size.

Reference-contexts: We say that such a model is a DNA level model. The evolutionary distance between two sequences in a DNA level model can most often be formulated as a classical alignment problem and be efficiently computed using a dynamic programming approach <ref> [9, 11-13] </ref>. It is well known that proteins evolve slower than its coding DNA, so it is usually more reliable to describe the evolutionary distance based on a comparison of the encoded proteins rather than on a comparison of the coding DNA itself. <p> The above alignment describes three matches and two gaps of combined length six. If the cost of any sequence of events is independent of the order but only depends on the set of events, then an optimal alignment can be computed efficiently using dynamic programming <ref> [9, 11-13] </ref>. In the DNA/protein model the cost of an event is the sum of the DNA level cost and the protein level cost.
