Abstract: This paper is concerned with the analysis of the re-routing effects of traffic flow that are induced by traffic signals. This is done by the calculation of a dynamic user-equilibrium traffic flow assignment using an iterative process. This iterative process is shown to be convergent through formal analysis and is studied by simulation experiments. Results from these simulation tests suggest that the type of traffic signal control and the exact signal plans used are key factors in accounting for shifts in traffic flows from drivers selecting different routes. Such re-routing is expected to be prevalent in an environment in which drivers are highly informed and can react to travel conditions throughout the day as is the case with the deployment of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). In such an environment, fixed-signal plans (generated by non-adaptive signal controllers) may result in widely-varying traffic flows on links, degrading the ability of traffic engineers, and the drivers themselves, to analyze and anticipate network conditions.

Reference-contexts: We use this same iterative philosophy towards seeking a solution to the same problem but with dynamic assignment and adaptive signal control. The IOA algorithm reflects, to a certain degree, what currently exists for a traffic network. Consider the following description. Quoting from Dickson <ref> [5] </ref>: ": : : the procedure of alternate assignment calculations with optimization of signal timings leading to mutually consistent points is that which seems to occur naturally. <p> Therefore, the statement of the problem is straightforward [but] exact solutions are hard to find."

We now outline here the specifics of several research efforts that are very similar to the efforts presented in this paper.

In Wunderlich <ref> [8] </ref>, travel time is recorded differently compared to our approach; travel times are recorded for intervals of time. During Wunderlich's SAVaNT process, each period of time T maintains an average travel time for each link; this can be determined by the experience of more than one vehicle. <p> This translates into an invalidation of Definition 3. Hence Theorem 1 and subsequent results are inapplicable. In <ref> [8] </ref>, the amount of backdating is denoted by the variable ffi, i.e., zero backdating ffi = 0 and full backdating ffi = 1. This was decreased further below zero as a tool to force SAVaNT to converge.

Reference-contexts: Certainly, the type of adaptive signal control used in a system is instrumental in effecting the traffic flow. Quoting from Ghali and M. Smith <ref> [9] </ref>, "It is therefore entirely reasonable to suspect that, at least occasionally, : : : , [signal] control actions taken today to reduce delays for major flows today may (if successful in reducing delay today) attract more traffic, increasing these major flows tomorrow and the day after and the day after <p> Furthermore, we consider adaptive, traffic responsive signal controllers which are not tuned using the usual control parameters of cycle length, phase split, and offset; this differs from a few related efforts which address the dynamic traffic assignment component <ref> [3, 9, 24] </ref> but only consider signal control with these parameters. A review (see Meneguzzer [4]) of those approaches utilizing an iterative method to solve the static problem points out that convergence cannot be guaranteed in general. <p> This is an important detail that will be revisited in x 7 (see Remark 2). Another research effort, to which our work bears some similarity is that of Ghali and M. Smith <ref> [9] </ref>. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and dynamic traffic assignment. Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic responsive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization [32], and Webster's equisaturation [33, 34]. The work in [9] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to that <p> Smith <ref> [9] </ref>. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and dynamic traffic assignment. Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic responsive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization [32], and Webster's equisaturation [33, 34]. The work in [9] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to that used by Kaufman, R. Smith and Wunderlich et al. but with traffic-responsive traffic signal controllers; these signal controllers are cycle-based, reactive (feedback controllers) signal controllers. <p> In summary, the routing algorithm accounts for time-varying travel times in order to determine the fastest route available at any time t for any vehicle that is scheduled to depart from its origin at that time. In this regard, the routing algorithm proceeds similarly to those in <ref> [35, 28, 9] </ref>. 4 Simulation Tests with Zero Backdating In this section, we present several simulation results of the IOA process depicted in Fig. 1. First, a "T-Network" is considered; it is shown in Figure 3. The network traffic load is generated at a fixed rate for twenty minutes.

Generally, the conditions for convergence and unique convergence (see <ref> [25, 26, 27] </ref>) are strict and may not be reasonable for any realistic model of a signalized traffic network 2 . Moreover, it was found by several of the aforementioned works that performance (i.e., average delay, travel time, etc.) degraded as the iterations proceeded [5, 20].

Reference-contexts: We now outline here the specifics of several research efforts that are very similar to the efforts presented in this paper. The work of Kaufman et al. [6, 11] and Wunderlich <ref> [8, 28] </ref> uses an iterative process to calculate a dynamic user-equilibrium solution to the DTA problem; however, we consider adaptive signal control whereas their work considers fixed periodic signal plans. <p> In summary, the routing algorithm accounts for time-varying travel times in order to determine the fastest route available at any time t for any vehicle that is scheduled to depart from its origin at that time. In this regard, the routing algorithm proceeds similarly to those in <ref> [35, 28, 9] </ref>. 4 Simulation Tests with Zero Backdating In this section, we present several simulation results of the IOA process depicted in Fig. 1. First, a "T-Network" is considered; it is shown in Figure 3. The network traffic load is generated at a fixed rate for twenty minutes.

Reference-contexts: We note that for static traffic assignment, which only considers time-invariant link cost functions, an equilibrium can be defined such that the least costly route choices carry no flow (see Wardrop <ref> [29] </ref>). In the context of the dynamic situation of interest in this paper, we use the following definition.

The iterative scheme used by Kaufman et al. was called Simulation of Anticipatory Vehicle Network Traffic (SAVaNT). Their work used a meso-scopic version of the INTEGRATION [31] software simulator. Traffic signals settings were pre-determined and fixed and thus not a consideration.

Reference-contexts: Smith [9]. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and dynamic traffic assignment.

The work in [9] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to that used by Kaufman, R. Smith and Wunderlich et al. but with traffic-responsive traffic signal controllers; these signal controllers are cycle-based, reactive (feedback controllers) signal controllers.

Test 7 used a phase split that was predetermined using the Webster's rule of equisaturation <ref> [34] </ref>, which is calculated using link flows according to the initial route assignment. As a result, the signal plan used in Test 7 was b = (36:7; 18:3). The equilibrium pair for Test 7 was different from the pair for Test 6.

Reference-contexts: The last part is a backtracking procedure. This algorithm is constrained only by maximum and minimum green times per phase and is free to consider cyclic and non-cyclic signal plans alike. The rolling horizon concept <ref> [38] </ref> is used for the calculation and implementation of optimal signal plans. The ALLONS-D decentralized architecture consists of one signal controller at each intersection of the network which attempts to minimize the aggregate delay at all approaches to that intersection.
