Abstract: We introduce and apply a new cw photomodulation technique, measured far from the steady-state, for obtaining the action spectra of the quantum efficiency (QE) of both neutral and charged excitations in films of a ladder-type poly(para-phenylene). Whereas the singlet exciton QE shows a step function increase at a photon energy, E, close to the optical gap, both triplet and polaron QE show, in addition a monotonous rise at higher E. The QE rise for triplets is explained by singlet exciton fission into triplet pairs, whereas for polarons it is modeled by a hot-exciton dissociation mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Typeset using REVT E X 1 The photogeneration dynamics of singlet excitons and secondary photoexcitations, such as triplets and polarons, in -conjugated polymers (PCP) have been usually measured by picosecond (ps) transient spectroscopic techniques rather than cw spectroscopies, since their photogeneration processes usually occur in the subnanosecond time domain <ref> [1] </ref>. On the other hand, the excited states energy levels are often measured in PCP by cw optical techniques, including electroabsorption [2], resonant Raman scattering [3] and two and three photon nonlinear optical spectroscopies [4].

We found that whereas the PL QE comprises of a step-function response at E close to the optical gap, E op '2.6eV, the QE for both triplet excitons and polarons also contains a monotonous rise at E&gt;E op . <p> However BR kinetics is not trivial for the triplet excitons; our results show, therefore that triplet-triplet annihilation, where dT 1 =dt ~ flT 2 1 is dominant in mLPPP, in contrast to T 1 kinetics in other PCP [14]. We note that the neat, planarized mLPPP backbone structure <ref> [7] </ref> may increase triplet diffussion in these films, thus promoting BR kinetics. 4 Fig. 2 right inset shows T () of triplets for both components; T in (at 15Hz, maximum I) and T Q (4kHz, at I/2). <p> From the fit to the data points (Fig. 4) we obtained for the tunneling model W=5.6eV, in excellent agreement with electron affinity measurements in mLPPP [5]; using m fl e =0.1m e we also obtained d=12 A, in reasonable agreement with neighboring interchain distance in mLPPP films <ref> [7] </ref>. In summary, we introduce a novel cw spectroscopic method, based on action spectra of PA in the PM spectrum measured under conditions far from the steady state, for obtaining the QE dynamics of photoexcitations in PCP.

Reference-contexts: The QE rise for polarons is explained by an Onsager-type exciton dissociation model with a three-dimensional energy gap E 3D '2.8eV, or by an electron interchain tunneling process. The cw PM technique used here is described in detail elsewhere <ref> [8] </ref>. For the excitation beam we used either an Ar + laser at a fixed E, or a monochromatized Xenon lamp at various E between 2 and 5eV. The excitation beam was modulated with a chopper at frequencies, f between 10Hz to 4kHz.

Reference-contexts: We thus obtain from the higher (E) onset at 3.2eV a value E T '1.6eV. The fit through the data points has been obtained <ref> [9] </ref> using exciton fission with E T =1.6eV, a chain length distribution and an energy dependent fission yield involving emission of the most strongly coupled vibrations (h!'0.15eV) using the Huang-Rhys ansatz. We note that the singlet exciton energy E S 'E op '2.6eV, is much larger than E T (=1.6eV).

Reference-contexts: Thus studies focused on the photoexcitation generation process via the E and dependencies of can be readily achieved with cw techniques. We note that in previous studies <ref> [10] </ref>, T frequency dependence was analyzed at StS and non-StS conditions; however, that T Q for ft 1 does not depend on t was not realized and thus basically ignored.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 2 we show the PM spectrum of a spin-cast mLPPP film at =80K, excited at E=3.5eV. The PM spectrum is dominated by the PA band T 1 at 1.3eV, which is due to an optical transition in the triplet manifold related to the photogenerated triplet excitons <ref> [11] </ref>, and by two correlated PA bands: P 1 and P 2 at 0.4 and 1.9eV, respectively, that are due to intra-gap optical transitions related to photogenerated polarons [12]; a series of photoinduced IR-active vibrations (IRAV) that are correlated with the PA bands P 1 and P 2 are also seen

Reference-contexts: The photobleaching (PB) feature in Fig. 2 marks the mLPPP optical gap, E op '2.6eV <ref> [13] </ref>. The left inset in Fig. 2 shows the PA laser excitation dependence, T in (G) at 100Hz for T 1 and P 1 PA bands. Both PA bands show a saturated G dependence, which, in light of our previous analysis, indicates BR kinetics. <p> This step function behaviour is similar to that measured in the best PPV films [16], and shows that singlet excitons are the primary excitations also in mLPPP, as can be also inferred from the large exciton binding energy (0.5eV) obtained for this polymer <ref> [13] </ref>. At longer times triplet excitons are formed in mLPPP, as may be concluded from the existence of the T 1 PA band in the PM spectrum (Fig. 2).

Reference-contexts: At f'4kHz, the quadrature PL component (PL) Q =0 since the PL lifetime t P L (&lt;1ns <ref> [15] </ref>) is sufficiently short to imply StS conditions (i.e. ft t1). In addition, we measured the absolute PL QE value, P L with an integrating sphere, and found P L '30% at E=3.5eV. From this value and (PL) in vs. E we obtained P L vs.

Reference-contexts: E we obtained P L vs. E as shown in Fig. 3 inset. It is seen that P L (E) abruptly increases at E=2.4eV, followed by a constant value at higher E. This step function behaviour is similar to that measured in the best PPV films <ref> [16] </ref>, and shows that singlet excitons are the primary excitations also in mLPPP, as can be also inferred from the large exciton binding energy (0.5eV) obtained for this polymer [13].

Reference-contexts: We identify this process as due to intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet manifold, which occurs following exciton thermalization at times of the order 1ns <ref> [17] </ref>, and hence its flat response with E for EE op . The other process, with an onset at E'3.2eV is therefore due to hot excitons and must thus occur very quickly.

Reference-contexts: One process is due to thermalized excitons and is thus independent of E, similar to P L (E). We identify this process as exciton dissociation (EX!e +h + !P +P + ) at impurities and defects in the film, similar to the "extrinsic" process observed in cw photoconductivity <ref> [18] </ref>. The second polaron photogeneration process is related to hot excitons and thus is probably intrinsic in nature showing a distinctive E dependence.
