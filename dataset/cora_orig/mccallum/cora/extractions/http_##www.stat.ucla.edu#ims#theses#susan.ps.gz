Reference-contexts: Usefulness of math and perceived value of math accounts for a portion of the gender differences in some studies, along with gender-stereotyped parental beliefs and math anxiety <ref> (Jacklin 1989) </ref>. Researchers in education have increasingly called for the use of longitudinal and hierarchical designs in order to examine the process of education.

Reference-contexts: One factor that may contribute to the gender-related differences is exposure to math; males enroll in more math courses than females, and it has been posited that they have more exposure to mathematics outside of the classroom <ref> (Kimball 1989) </ref>. Controlling for the number of advanced math courses does diminish the differences between males and females on standardized math achievement tests, but it does not completely eliminate them. Gender-related differences in math exposure outside of the classroom may contribute to gender differences as well. <p> In addition, some research has found that academic and non-academic interactions in the classroom occur more frequently for males, and males receive more encouragement, praise and discipline while females receive more discouragement <ref> (Kimball 1989) </ref>. High achievers received more attention than low achievers in one study, and high-achieving males and low-achieving females received more attention than high-achieving females in another study. One study found that females receive better grades in a cooperative atmosphere as opposed to a competitive one. <p> Gender-related learning styles may be partially responsible for the sex differences favoring females in the classroom and the differences favoring males on achievement tests <ref> (Kimball 1989) </ref>. Specifically, some evidence suggests that females have a rote memorization learning style while that of males may be characterized as autonomous.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Until around the middle of the twentieth century, gender differences in intellectual abilities were considered "natural" or inherently dependent on biological sex differences <ref> (Sadker, Sadker, and Klein 1991) </ref>. The landmark publication of Maccoby and Jacklin's The Psychology of Sex Differences in 1974 raised many questions concerning the biological basis of gender differences. <p> In subsequent research, both biological and environmental variables have been posited as "causes" of these gender-related differences. Biological explanations focus on the relationship between exposure to testosterone in utero and hemispheric activity in the brain, while environmental explanations are centered on childhood socialization and child-rearing practices <ref> (Sadker, et al 1991) </ref>. One problem that is not addressed in this research is the inability to isolate the effects of gender socialization from observed biological sex when observational data is used. Past research has discovered many intermediate variables, or covariates that are indicators of gender/math socialization.
