Abstract: We present a new approach for establishing correspondence between two homeomorphic 3D polyhedral models. The user can specify corresponding feature pairs on the polyhedra with a simple and intuitive interface. Based on these features, our algorithm decomposes the boundary of each polyhedron into the same number of morphing patches. A 2D mapping for each morphing patch is computed in order to merge the topologies of the polyhedra one patch at a time. We create a morph by defining morphing trajectories between the feature pairs and by interpolating them across the merged polyhedron. The user interface provides high-level control as well as local refinement to improve the morph. The implementation has been applied to several complex polyhedra composed of thousands of polygons. The system can also handle non-simple polyhedra that have holes.

Reference-contexts: Given two triangular faces F A i j of a morphing patch, let them map to the triangles f A i j , respectively, in the 2D polygon. Our goal, as detailed in <ref> [13] </ref> is to produce a mapping such that the ratio of the areas between F A i F A is close to that of f A i j regular 2D polygons. <p> Similarly we allow the user to represent the trajectory as a Bzier curve for each pair of extremal vertices. The system then interpolates the trajectories for all other vertices of the merged polyhedron using weighted contributions of the morphing trajectories at the extremal vertices. More details are given in <ref> [13] </ref>. In addition to the morphing trajectories required by the algorithm, other attributes of the input polyhedra need to be interpolated to generate a good morph. These include vertex colors, lighting coefficients, normal vectors, etc. Interpolation of these surface attributes occurs during the mapping and merging steps [13]. 7 User Interface <p> are given in <ref> [13] </ref>.

Although it is easy for the user to conceptualize a morph between two objects, it can be rather difficult to design a system that allows the user to express this easily. <p> It has been successfully applied to a number of simple and non-simple polyhedral models. We believe it is versatile enough to produce visually pleasing 3D morphs when coupled with an effective method for specifying the interpolation between the two models. More details about our system are available in <ref> [13] </ref>. The specification of the feature net suffers from two limitations: the feature net must be connected and the chains connecting the feature net vertices are currently restricted to lie on the edges of the source models. It can be difficult to control the morphing trajectories for complicated models.

Reference-contexts: The set of algorithms can be classified into those that operate on raster images such as [2, 9, 23, 35, 36] and those that operate on geometric representations <ref> [14, 31, 32, 34] </ref> . There is considerable literature on morphing between 3D volumetric models [7, 8, 15, 24, 29] . Several approaches related to establishing correspondence between 3D polygonal objects for shape transformation and metamorphosis have been proposed.

Several approaches related to establishing correspondence between 3D polygonal objects for shape transformation and metamorphosis have been proposed. Graphics techniques based on deformations <ref> [1, 33] </ref> and particle systems [30] can be used for object metamorphosis. Hong et al. [17] present an approach for polyhedral models that matches the faces whose centroids are closest. Chen and Parent [6] present an algorithm to transform piecewise linear 2D contours and extend it to 3D cylindrical objects.
