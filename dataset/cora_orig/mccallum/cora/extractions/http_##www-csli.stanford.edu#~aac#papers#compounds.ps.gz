Abstract: We describe a formal framework for interpretation of words and compounds in a discourse context which integrates a symbolic lexicon/grammar, word-sense probabilities, and a pragmatic component. The approach is motivated by the need to handle productive word use. In this paper, we concentrate on compound nominals. We discuss the inadequacies of approaches which consider compound interpretation as either wholly lexico-grammatical or wholly pragmatic, and provide an alternative inte grated account.

Reference-contexts: Compounds are attested with meanings which can only be determined contextually. Downing (1977) discusses apple juice seat, uttered in a context in which it identifies a place-setting with a glass of apple juice. Even for compounds with established meanings, context can force an alternative interpretation <ref> (Bauer, 1983) </ref>. These problems led to analyses in which the relationship between the parts of a compound is undetermined by the grammar, e.g., Dowty (1979), Bauer (1983).

Reference-contexts: Smoothing is necessary to avoid giving a non-zero probability for possible senses which are not found in a particular corpus. For derived forms, the applicable lexical rules or schemata determine possible senses <ref> (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996) </ref>. Thus for known compounds, probabilities of established senses depend on corpus frequencies but a residual probability is distributed between unseen interpretations licensed by schemata, to allow for novel uses. This distribution is weighted to allow for productivity differences between schemata.

Reference-contexts: Link (1983)). We follow Johnston and Busa (1996) in using Pustejovsky's (1995) concept of telic role to encode the purpose of an artifact. These schemata give minimal indications of compound semantics: it may be desirable to provide more information <ref> (Johnston et al, 1995) </ref>, but we will not discuss that here. Established compounds may have idiosyncratic interpretations or inherit from one or more schemata (though compounds with multiple established senses due to ambiguity in the relationship between constituents rather than lexical ambiguity are fairly unusual).

Reference-contexts: This framework has already been successful in accounting for other phenomena on the interface between the lexicon and pragmatics, e.g., Asher and Lascarides (1995), Lascarides and Copestake (1995), Lascarides, Copestake and Briscoe (1996). sdrt is an extension of drt <ref> (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) </ref>, where discourse is represented as a recursive set of drss representing the clauses, linked together with rhetorical relations such as Elaboration and Contrast, cf. Hobbs (1985), Polanyi (1985).
