There are several systems that have either taken this approach, or at least require a substantial amount of schema integration; these include Pegasus [8], UniSQL [3], multidatabase systems (e.g., InterBase [7]), and Federated databases [2].

Abstract: Sybil is a database integration and evolution environment for supporting large, heterogeneous applications. We are interested in using Sybil to support the data integration and evolution needs of applications that are using legacy databases and are looking to integrate with more modern database systems. The Sybil approach is based on loosely coupling databases or other persistent tools into lightweight alliances tailored for specific applications. Such alliances are built via four sorts of constructs: heterogeneous views, inter-database constraints, inter-database propagations, and integration supported by domain specific information. Sybil is a database integration and evolution environment for supporting exactly such large, heterogeneous environments. In particular, we are interested in using Sybil to support the data integration and evolution needs of applications that are using legacy databases and are looking to integrate in more modern database systems (e.g., relational or object-oriented). Such environments typically have several criteria for integration. First, as new databases are added, relationships between the new databases and the existing legacy systems need to be defined. Second, in many cases, the ultimate goal is to eventually migrate the legacy data to newer systems in order to take advantage of the tools provided by such systems (e.g., transaction management, concurrency, modern query languages, etc.). And third, such environments generally need to be able to keep legacy applications running without rewriting existing code.
