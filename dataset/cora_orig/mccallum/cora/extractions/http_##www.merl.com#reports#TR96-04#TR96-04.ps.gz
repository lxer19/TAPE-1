Abstract: Some apparently powerful algorithms for automatic label placement on maps use heuristics that capture considerable cartographic expertise but are hampered by provably inefficient methods of search and optimization. On the other hand, no approach to label placement that is based on an efficient optimization technique has been applied to the production of general cartographic maps | those with labeled point, line, and area features | and shown to generate labelings of acceptable quality. We present an algorithm for label placement that achieves the twin goals of practical efficiency and high labeling quality by combining simple cartographic heuristics with effective stochastic optimization This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: However, it will clearly not suffice for all area-feature shapes and all position-generation algorithms. If necessary, additional metrics that are more sensitive to the shape of the area feature, e.g., metrics that encourage alignment with an area's medial axis <ref> (Ahn and Freeman, 1984) </ref>, can be incorporated into the evaluation function. We omit such metrics from this discussion.

Reference-contexts: more powerful optimization strategies that have been proposed for label placement, physical relaxation (Feigenbaum, 1994; Hirsch, 1982), integer programming (Zoraster, 1986; Zoraster, 1990), gradient descent (Christensen, Marks, and Shieber, 1993), and simulated annealing (Chris-tensen, Marks, and Shieber, 1993) are four techniques that all outperform depth-first search by a wide margin <ref> (Christensen, Marks, and Shieber, 1995) </ref>. <p> We discuss these subtasks in reverse order in the next three sections. Because of the simplicity of the position-selection method, we discuss it briefly; full details have been presented elsewhere <ref> (Christensen, Marks, and Shieber, 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The actual values used are illustrated in Figure 2. They are based loosely on Imhof's well-known guidelines <ref> (Imhof, 1962) </ref>: * Label positions to the right of a point are preferred to those on the left. * Labels above a point are preferred to those below. * The more a label's baseline is offset from a horizontal line through the center of its associated point, the less favored it

Reference-contexts: Although many different methods have been proposed for this task, we favor a method based on simulated annealing <ref> (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi, 1983) </ref>: 1. For each feature, place its label randomly in any one of the candidate positions for that feature. 2. Initialize a "temperature" T to an initial high value. 3.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the area is labeled as if it were a point feature.) We then generate n (typically 200) quasirandom points evenly distributed throughout P 0 using a Sobol' quasir-andom sequence <ref> (Press et al., 1992) </ref>. 3 Candidate positions are generated centered at these 200 points.
