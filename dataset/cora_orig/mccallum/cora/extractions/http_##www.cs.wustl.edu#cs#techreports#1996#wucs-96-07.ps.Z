Abstract: This report describes the design and implementation of a gigabit ATM switching system supporting link rates from 150 Mb/s to 2.4 Gb/s, with a uniquely efficient multicast switch architecture that enables the construction of systems with essentially constant per port costs for configurations ranging from 8 to 4096 ports and system capacities approaching 10 Tb/s. The system design supports many-to-one and many-to-many forms of multicast, in addition to the usual one-to-many. It also provides multicast virtual paths, constant time configuration of multicast connections and an efficient packet-level discard method, that can achieve 100% link efficiencies, without large buffers.

Reference-contexts: This is true for both point-to-point and multipoint traffic. The queueing performance of multistage switching networks with shared buffer switch elements and interstage flow control is studied in <ref> [1] </ref>. This paper shows that when the internal link speeds have a cell processing rate of more than 1.25 that of the external links, a system with eight port shared buffer switches and 32 cell buffers can handle fully loaded external links under uniform random traffic.

Reference-contexts: This can be readily increased to accommodate larger delay variations, with only a small incremental cost. The circuit has been successfully tested at clock frequencies up to 180 MHz. More details can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.2. Output Crossbar Each column in the output crossbar includes a control circuit that arbitrates requests for access to that output. A particular column has the potential for getting simultaneous requests from any subset of the BCCs.

Reference-contexts: In a switch element supporting multicast, reference counts are required for the stored cells, so that the storage can be recovered when the last copy has been transmitted. One of the first examples of this type of design can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. The second approach, which is adopted here, is to provide a set of independent storage elements, each with its own control circuitry and use crossbars at the input and output to provide access to these storage elements.

Reference-contexts: There are two extreme approaches one can take to this problem. At one extreme, once can construct a classical synchronous system and tightly control the wiring to minimize clock skew and data path lengths through clever packaging strategies. This approach is exemplified by <ref> [4] </ref>. The other extreme is to adopt a fully asynchronous approach in which clock signals are passed with data from chip to chip.

Reference-contexts: This is done using a bit serial maximum-finding circuit to select the maximum waiting time value. (This technique was borrowed from the original Datakit bus arbitration circuit <ref> [5] </ref>.) If a particular BCC's request to use a particular output is refused, the control circuitry in the output crossbar continues to contend for the output on subsequent cycles until the request is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: In a switching network, where data can be received from multiple upstream neighbors, this approach still leaves one with the need to synchronize the arriving streams to a local timing reference. We have taken an intermediate approach (first described in <ref> [6] </ref>) in which a single clock and cell timing signal are distributed throughout the system so that all chips operate from a common frequency reference. However, we allow some variability in the timing of arriving data to allow for clock skew and variations in wire lengths.

Reference-contexts: Resequencing Cells The resequencer ensures that cells, which may follow different paths through the switching network and be delayed by different amounts of time, are restored to their original order before transmission on the external links. It uses a timing-based resequencing method <ref> [7] </ref>. Cells being sent from an IPP to the switching network are time-stamped with their time of entry (placed in the cell's Timestamp field (TS)).

Reference-contexts: In long distance applications, where the fiber savings play a dominant role, the advantage is much larger (60-to-1 for a 50 mile link). In the remaining sections, we describe the design and implementation of the WUGS switch, which at this writing is approaching completion. An earlier paper <ref> [8] </ref> describes our basic multicast switching technique and includes an analysis of its scaling efficiency and 4 Design of a Gigabit ATM Switch performance characteristics. Another earlier paper [9] compares our multicast switching approach to competing alternatives and demonstrates order-of-magnitude improvements in cost/performance in large configurations. <p> For n = 8 k , the Benes network constructed using eight port switch elements has 2k 1 stages. Since k = log 8 n, the number of switch elements scales in proportion to n log n, which is the best possible scaling characteristic. In <ref> [8] </ref>, it is shown that when dynamic load distribution is performed in the first k 1 stages of a Benes network, that the load on the internal data paths of the switching network cannot exceed the load on the external ports; that is the network achieves ideal load balancing. <p> Through this process, a connection with f destinations can be handled in log 2 f passes through the network. In <ref> [8] </ref>, it is shown that this technique, coupled with a buffered multistage switching network using dynamic routing, yields optimal cost/performance scaling, with respect to both the switching network complexity and the Chaney, Fingerhut, Flucke and Turner 7 amount of routing memory required. <p> This allows cells that went through before the reconfiguration a chance to catch up. The added delay is smoothly reduced over a short period of time (10-20 s in the WUGS switch), causing only a momentary irregularity in the flow of cells through the connection. See <ref> [8] </ref> for more details. 4.2. Congestion Control The port processor implements several simple mechanisms to control the effects of congestion. First, the XMB, where most cell queueing occurs in the system, provides separate buffers for reservation-oriented continuous stream traffic and bursty discrete stream traffic.

Reference-contexts: The particular algorithm used is a variation of the well-known Early Packet Discard technique in which hysteresis is added to damp the oscillations that can otherwise occur, making it possible to achieve 100% throughput with modest buffer sizes <ref> [11] </ref>. The block discard is implemented through the use of a Block Discard Index (BDI) which is inserted into arriving cells at the VXT. A non-zero BDI indicates a virtual circuit on which block discarding can be performed.
