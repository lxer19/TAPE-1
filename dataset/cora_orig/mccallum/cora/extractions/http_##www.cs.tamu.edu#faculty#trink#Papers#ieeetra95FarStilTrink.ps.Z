Abstract: The efficient planning of contact tasks for intelligent robotic systems requires a thorough understanding of the kinematic constraints imposed on the system by the contacts. In this paper, we derive closed-form analytic solutions for the position and orientation of a passive polygon moving in sliding and rolling contact with two or three active polygons whose positions and orientations are independently controlled. This is accomplished by applying a simple elimination procedure to solve the appropriate system of contact constraint equations. The benefits of having analytic solutions are numerous. For example, they eliminate the need for iterative nonlinear equation solving algorithms to determine the position and orientation of the passive polygon given the positions and orientations of the active ones. Also, because they contain the configuration variables of the active polygons and the relevant geometric parameters, models of geometric and control uncertainty can be readily incorporated into the solutions. This will facilitate the analysis of the effects of these uncertainties on the kinematic constraints. We also prove that the set of solutions to the contact constraint equations is a smooth submanifold of the system's configuration space and we study its projection fl This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, grant no.

Reference-contexts: The results presented in this paper can also be viewed as an extension of Brost's work <ref> [2] </ref>. In his terminology, Brost developed techniques for computing and representing the configuration obstacle (C-obstacle) of two polygons in the plane. <p> Brost identified this nongeneric situation and noted that either there are no geometrically admissible workpiece configurations or an infinite number <ref> [2] </ref>. In the latter case, the workpiece can be translated along the contacted edges while maintaining the specified CF. <p> This new contact situation is discussed below. Our use of the term "nongeneric" is similar to Brost's <ref> [2] </ref>: the system of contact constraint equations does not satisfy "general position." Loosely speaking, a loss of general position implies that either a system of n equations in m unknowns (m &gt; n) has more than the expected m n degrees of freedom, or that solutions occur with multiplicities, or that

Reference-contexts: Mathematically, this fact is related to standard results in algebraic geometry which say that every nongeneric system of polynomial equations can be made generic by a suitably small perturbation of the coefficients <ref> [3] </ref>. However, from a computational and modeling standpoint, nongeneric situations are common, and if they are not understood completely, they will compromise the robustness of any dexterous manipulation planning algorithm based on geometric models.

Reference-contexts: Because the "bags" of solution "tricks" used by RAPT and Taylor's system were not complete, they were not able to fully simplify all systems of equations. An alternative system was developed by Corner, Ambler, and Popplestone <ref> [4] </ref>. This system was able to recognize standard combinations of relationships among the bodies and apply the corresponding standard solutions. The result was a more efficient system.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we limit our discussion to manipulator composed of three independent polygons, so the manipulator has nine control parameters. 1 The term "elemental contact" <ref> [5] </ref> refers to either a type A or a type B contact. 5 Brost represented the patches and edges of the C-obstacle in parametric form and found the vertices by numerical solution. <p> A set of elemental contacts constitutes a contact formation, CF <ref> [5] </ref>. Based on the numbers of type A and B contacts, we classify CF's into various types. For example, the CF shown in Figure 1 is of type 2AB.

Reference-contexts: The worst case running times of general motion planning algorithms increase exponentially with the dimension of the system's configuration space (C-space). Nonetheless, nonpathological planning problems have been solved in several minutes indicating that the exponential worst-case complexity should not deter the future development of planning algorithms <ref> [7] </ref>. Since fine manipulation requires contacts, algorithms for fine motion planning can be more efficient, because the kinematic constraint equation associated with each contact effectively reduces the dimension of C-space by one. <p> Besides the effective reduction in the dimension of C-space due to the contacts, there are two other good reasons to believe that practical fine manipulation planning algorithms can be developed: first, to find a plan, the entire C-space need not be decomposed (for example, see <ref> [27, 10, 7] </ref>); and second, cell decomposition techniques lend themselves to parallel and distributed computation. In this paper, we present the geometric characterization and analytic representation of eight fundamental types of kinematic constraint "surfaces" in C-space (called "contact formation cells" [30] [29]).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7: For a generic positioning r of the manipulator, we will have zero, two, or four geometrically admissible workpiece configurations. Proof: A valid configuration must satisfy equations (66) and (67) each of which has degree 2. By Bezout's Theorem <ref> [8] </ref>, the number of intersections is 4 counting points at infinity, complex intersections, and multiplicities. For the case where all intersections are real, finite 25 and of multiplicity one, the number of configurations is precisely 4. This is the maximum possible number of geometrically admissible configurations.

Reference-contexts: a move along the "surface." In her dissertation, Koutsou noted that C-surfaces corresponding to single type A, type B, and type C contacts are manifolds (and thus have a well-defined tangent space at each point), but that one cannot assume that the same is true for intersections of these manifolds <ref> [11] </ref>. In this paper, we show that the eight CF-cells studied are smooth manifolds. However, we note that the same cannot be said when one or more of the contacting surfaces are curved.

Reference-contexts: a plane among polygonal obstacles, two types of elemental contacts have been defined: type A, which is a contact between an edge of the robot and a vertex of an obstacle; and type B, which is a contact between a vertex of the robot and an edge of an obstacle <ref> [12] </ref>. In the work presented here, we view the workpiece as a mobile robot and the manipulator as a deformable obstacle. <p> 2; 3g: (4) Z is topologically the product space R 10 fi T 3 , where R 10 is ten-dimensional Euclidean space and T 3 is the three-torus (the product of three circles parametrized by the variables 1 ; 2 ; 3 ). 8 Note that Z is a manifold <ref> [12] </ref>. The usual C-space X for our four-polygon system would be the submanifold of Z cut out by the equation c 2 + s 2 1 = 0. It would be 12-dimensional, while Z is 13-dimensional.

The signed distance between vertex l and the line supporting edge l, the so called C-function <ref> [12] </ref>, is given by: C l (p) = v l (g l h l ) (5) where the vectors g l , h l , and v l are defined as follows: g l = (x l + cos ( l )u l sin ( l )v l ; y l

Reference-contexts: This position can be found by back substituting into equations (19). The points, r, in the manipulator configuration space, where Proposition 4 is satisfied will be referred to as exceptional points. These points "blow up" <ref> [22] </ref> to circles on the CF-cell. Each direction in manipulator configuration space in a neighborhood of an exceptional point potentially gives rise to a different limit point (in the CF-cell).

Reference-contexts: The workpiece and the manipulator taken together are referred to as the manipulation system, or just the system. The process of reorienting the workpiece by controlling the manipulator is known as dexterous manipulation. In contrast to the classical piano movers' problem <ref> [23] </ref> in which contact is avoided, every solution to a dexterous manipulation planning problem must include contact. When the level of uncertainty is a significant factor in the planning and execution of a dexterous manipulation task, then we refer to it as a fine motion or fine manipulation task.

This was accomplished by including error parameters in the constraint inequalities, expanding them, and retaining only the terms which were constant or linear in the error parameters.
