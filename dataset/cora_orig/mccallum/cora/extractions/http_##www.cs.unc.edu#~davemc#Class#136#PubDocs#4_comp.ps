Abstract: This is a short introduction to the efficient calculation of image compositions. Some of the techniques shown here are not well known, and should be. In particular, we will explain the difference between premultiplied alpha and not 1 . These two related notions are often confused, or not even understood. We shall show that premultiplied alpha is more efficient, yields more elegant formulas, and occurs commonly in practice. We shall show that the non-premultiplied alpha formulation is not closed on over , the fundamental image compositing operatoras usually defined. Most importantly, the notion of premultiplied alpha leads directly to the notion of image object , or sprite a shaped image with partial transparencies. There are two ways to think of the alpha of a pixel. As is usual in computer graphics, one interpretation comes from the geometry half of the world and the other from the imaging half. Geometers think of pixels as geometrical areas intersected by geometrical objects 2 . For them, alpha is the percentage coverage of a pixel by a geometrical object. Imagers think of pixels as point samples of a continuum. For them, alpha is the opacity at each sample. In the end, it is the imaging model that dominates, because a geometric picture must be reduced to point samples to displayit must be rendered. Thus, during rendering coverage is always converted to opacity, and all geometry is lost.

Reference-contexts: last stage of a 3D rendering project: all the objects are rendered as sprites 7 , then they are composited, and 6 I just discovered (November 5, 1996) in a correspondence with Marc Levoy that he and Bruce Wallace came up with an equivalent formulation for the nonpremultiplied case in <ref> [Wallace81] </ref>, p. 257. 7 I am loosening the terminology here, temporarily, to extend sprite-hood to non-premultiplied images with an alpha.
