Abstract: A familiar task in industrial applications is grasping an object to constrain its motions. When the external forces and torques acting on the object are uncertain or varying, form-closure grasps are preferred; these are grasps that constrain all infinitesimal and finite motion of the object. Much of previous work on computing form-closures has involved achieving it with point-contacts; for a planar object, four point-contacts were proven to be necessary and sufficient. Inspired by the intuitive habit of supporting an object against something flat to immobilize it, in this paper we propose a new class of contacts called edge-contacts; these offer a straight-line support against which the object rests. Our first result is that almost any polygonal part can be constrained in form-closure with an edge-contact and two point-contacts. A related problem is that of immobilizing an object with modular fixtures. These typically comprise of a regular lattice of holes on which the object is placed and a set of precision contacting elements or fixels whose locations are constrained by the grid. Given the input object modeled as an n-gon, the grid size, and the shapes of the fixels available, we present an algorithm that returns all valid modular fixtures, each accomplished by an edge-fixel, a locator-fixel and a clamp. The algorithm uses sophisticated data-structures to achieve output-sensitivity; it runs in O(n(n+p) 4=3+* +K) time, where K is the number of valid solutions (fixture configurations) returned, and p is the object's perimeter in grid units. fl Department of Computer Science, Utrecht University, P.O.Box 80.089, 3508 TB Utrecht, the Netherlands, fmarkov, chantalg@cs.ruu.nl.

Reference-contexts: Since the parallelogram only exists between shifts (t a ; t b ) which may not be (0; 1). We build a range tree representing heights at which the segments occur. With every node in this tree, we associate a partition tree <ref> [1, 7] </ref> on the segments associated with the values that are present below this particular node. Such a partition tree can be queried with a plane in order to obtain all segments that intersect this query plane. <p> Each horizontal clamp-edge combination results in a directed line representing the corresponding half-plane constraint; this directed line is labelled with the appropriate subintervals for which the clamp-edge combination exists. To simplify matters, let us suppose that if there are fi disjoint subintervals of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> during which a clamp-edge combination exists, then we have fi copies of the appropriate directed line, each copy representing a different disjoint subinterval. Thus, in all, we have a set S H of O (n + p) directed lines, each associated with a single interval of shift values.

Reference-contexts: The above proofs immediately gives us an algorithm to compute one form-closure for a given polygon. First, we compute the maximal inscribed circle of the polygon. This can be done in time O (n log n) by computing the medial axis of P <ref> [10] </ref> and in time O (n) when P is convex. Then, if necessary, we compute the edge of the convex hull that is closest to this inscribed circle; this gives us the edge-contact.

Reference-contexts: By the fixture model, we imply the set of allowable contact types. The conceptually simplest model is that of point contacts. It has been known since Reuleaux that fixturing a planar object requires at least four frictionless contacts. Mishra, Schwartz, and Sharir [13] and Markenscoff, Ni and Papadimitriou <ref> [11] </ref> independently proved that four point-contacts are also sufficient. While point-contacts are conceptually simple, they are not always easy to achieve in practice. The reason is that for form-closure, these point-contacts have to be capable of resisting arbitrary wrenches and therefore they have to be backed by bulky supports. <p> Notice that both conditions from Lemma 1 are satisfied. To compute one form-closure configuration, we look at maximal inscribed circles. Any maximal inscribed circle of a polygon without pairs of parallel edges touches the polygon in at least three points. The following result follows from Markenscoff et al. <ref> [11] </ref>.

The k 0 angles can be reported in O (log m) canonical subsets in the nodes of the tree. In these subsets we have to search for intersections between the corresponding line segments and the query line segment.
