Abstract: A general problem in qualitative physics is determining the consequences of assumptions about the behavior of a system. If the space of behaviors is represented by an envisionment, many such consequences can be represented by pruning states from the envisionment. This paper provides a formal logic of occurrence which justifies the algorithms involved and provides a language for relating specific histories to envisionments. The concepts and axioms are general enough to be applicable to any system of qualitative physics. We further propose the concept of transverse quantities as a general solution to qualitative versions of Zeno's paradox. The utility of these ideas is illustrated by a rational reconstruction of the pruning algorithms used in FROB, a working AI program.

Reference-contexts: Understanding these indirect consequences is useful for determining if we have imposed the correct constraints on our design or if our assumptions about an observed system are correct. Figure 1 shows an example of these conclusions drawn by an existing AI program, FROB <ref> [5] </ref>, that reasons about moving point-masses in a 2D world. The formalization presented here explicitly identifies the intuitions embodied in these algorithms, making them available for general application. The following section describes the logic of occurrence, introducing registrations to represent the relationship between envisionments and histories. <p> Part (b) (left) shows FROB's initial envisionment, based only on assuming that the ball is in SR0, and on the right is the result of pruning the envisionment to reflect the consequences of various additional assumptions. Each arrow and circle depicts a potential qualitative state of the ball (see <ref> [5] </ref> for details). The additional assumptions are shown in FROB's answers below. The only quantitative information used was the initial position and velocity of the ball in using energy constraints to calculate the maximum height the ball could reach. All other conclusions are based solely on qualitative information. <p> Several forms of external constraints have already been explored in qualitative physics, including explicit user assumptions, consequences of additional data (e. g. numerical simulations, energy constraints in <ref> [5] </ref>), and measurements [7,8]). No matter what the source of data, a few simple distinctions suffice for our purposes: Axiom 6 (Status of states) Consider a registration R involving envisionment E .

Reference-contexts: we must introduce an abstraction that will cover both the leftward motion of the ball and the energy of the mass-spring combination: Definition 9 (Transverse quantities) A transverse quantity T with respect to a cycle C in E is a property of the envisioned physical system such that: 3 See <ref> [6] </ref> for how this can be proven in QP theory. Advocates of classical continuity in qualitative physics (e. g. [2,13] will claim that the block indeed never stops.

Reference-contexts: The major unsolved problem is automatically detecting transverse quantities. One avenue is to simply declare them | energy, after all, is the typical choice. Another possibility is to extend Weld's aggregation technique <ref> [12] </ref> to extract transverse quantities as a side-effect of the cycle summarization procedure. 6 Acknowledgements This work benefitted from conversations with Dedre Gentner, Dennis DeCoste, and Brian Falkenhainer.
