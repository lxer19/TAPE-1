Abstract: The process of rational inquiry can be defined as the evolution of a rational agent's belief set as a consequence of its internal inference procedures and its interaction with the environment. These beliefs can be modelled in a formal way using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. These problems can be avoided with a syntactic view of possible worlds, defining them as arbitrary sets of sentences in a propositional doxastic logic. In this paper this syntactic view of possible worlds is taken, and a dynamic analysis of the agent's beliefs is suggested in order to model the process of rational inquiry in which the agent is permanently engaged. One component of this analysis, the logical one, is summarily described. This dimension of analysis is performed using a modified version of the analytic tableaux method, and it models the evolution of the beliefs due to the agent's deductive power. It is shown how non-perfect reasoning can be modelled in two ways: on one hand, the agent's deductive abilities can be controlled by restricting the tautologies that may be used in the course of this logical analysis; on the other hand, it is not compulsory to perform an exhaustive analysis of the initial tableau.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the possibility of adding this kind of tautologies in the analytic tableaux is a well-known idea in the tradition of classical proof theory, as described e.g. in <ref> [BEMA77] </ref>. It has also been suggested by Hintikka in his interrogative model of inquiry (see e.g. [HINT81], [HINT86], [HINT92]), in which the process of scientific inquiry is modelled with plays of the interrogative game, which is a game played by the Inquirer and Nature.

Reference-contexts: authors deal with the problems of logical omniscience and perfect reasoning by introducing impossible possible worlds, e.g. possible worlds where logical connectives do not behave in the usual way, or tautologies may not be true, or inconsistent formulas may hold (see e.g. impossible possible worlds in [HINT75], non-classical worlds in <ref> [CRES72] </ref>, nonstandard worlds in [REBR79] or situations in [LEVE84]). These semantic approaches somehow alleviate those problems, but they cause different ones (see e.g. [McAR88], [REIC89] for detailed reviews of these and other approaches).

Reference-contexts: them (call that a context), it can draw conclusions which are consistent within the context but inconsistent if all the beliefs are considered (this fact was remarked by Shoham in [SHOH91]; Fagin and Halpern modelled this situation in their logic of local reasoning, [FAHA85]; Delgrande also considered this idea in <ref> [DELG95] </ref>). It is arguably possible to define interesting procedures of inquiry over incon sistent belief sets (as shown e.g. in [REBR79]). The situation where no tautological information is believed could model ([JASP94]) for instance the initial state of information in the environmen talist tabula rasa theories of Locke and Rousseau.

Reference-contexts: Some arguments against logical omniscience and perfect reasoning could be the following: The agent can be unaware of certain facts (Fagin and Halpern tried to take this fact into account in their logic of general awareness, <ref> [FAHA85] </ref>). The agent can have limited resources (e.g. the time required or the space needed to perform a given inference). This is the most evident justification, if rational agents have to be implemented at all in real computers. <p> if it focuses in a subset of them (call that a context), it can draw conclusions which are consistent within the context but inconsistent if all the beliefs are considered (this fact was remarked by Shoham in [SHOH91]; Fagin and Halpern modelled this situation in their logic of local reasoning, <ref> [FAHA85] </ref>; Delgrande also considered this idea in [DELG95]). It is arguably possible to define interesting procedures of inquiry over incon sistent belief sets (as shown e.g. in [REBR79]).

Reference-contexts: These properties could be appropriate if the agent's designer wished to model ideal agents (e.g. the children in the muddy children puzzle, see <ref> [FHMV95] </ref>), but they are clearly inadequate if more realistic (human or computational) agents are considered.

Reference-contexts: Some authors (see e.g. <ref> [HALP86] </ref>) argue that, in this case, there seems to be no way to make a knowledge-based analysis of the agent's beliefs.

Reference-contexts: We will also consider these two dimensions of analysis, as shown in Sect. 3. Logics of belief (doxastic logics, see e.g. <ref> [HAMO92] </ref>) are tools used to analyse in a formal way the reasoning about belief performed by an intelligent agent.
