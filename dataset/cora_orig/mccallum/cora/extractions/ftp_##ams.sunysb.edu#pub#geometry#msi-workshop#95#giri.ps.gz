Abstract: A simple polygon P is said to have a Hamilitonian Triangulation if it has a triangulation whose dual graph contains a Hamiltonian path. Such triangulations are useful in fast rendering engines in Computer Graphics. Arkin et al. [AHMS] observed that a polygon has a Hamiltonian triangulation if and only if it is Discretely Straight Walkable, a concept that is a discrete version of Straight Walkability concept as introduced by Icking and Klein [IK]. Using this characterization, Arkin et al. also showed an algorithm to recognize such polygons in time that is linear in the size of the visibility polygon of the given polygon P . The size of the visbility polygon of P could be quadratic in the size of P and hence their algorithm could be very inefficient even for nearly convex polygons. We give a new characterization of polygons with Hamiltonian triangulations. We use this characterization to present the following algorithms:
