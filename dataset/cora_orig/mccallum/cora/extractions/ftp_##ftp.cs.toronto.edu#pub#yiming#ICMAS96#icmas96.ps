Abstract: This paper 1 proposes the idea of vision agents over Internet and describes an object search agent and its communications with other agents. The goal is to reduce the traffic on the Internet for Live WWW by integrating the WWW technology, agent theory and computer vision technology together. The WWW technology has advanced rapidly such that even live video can be integrated into the Web. But, there are some problems that make the real time transmission of the video data from the server site to the client site not appealing, one of them being the intense use of bandwidth. When the modem at the client site is slow, the real time video transmission simply will not work. One way to limit the bandwidth that is used is to lower the rate of the image transmission. But if the image rate is too low, the clients might feel inconvenient and might wait for a long time to get the wanted image. The goal of the CAS-LWWW (Centre for Ad- vanced Studies-Live World Wide Web) project is to solve the above problems and reduce the Internet traffic by integrating computer vision technology, agent theory and WWW technology together. Instead of frequently transmitting the image data grabbed from the camera to the client and let the client to analysis the video image, we simply build agents at the server site and ask the agents to help executing the tasks required by the clients. Therefore, the image grabbed from the camera is first pre-processed by the agents, only those images that are of interest to the client are sent through the Internet. Thus the bandwidth used is greatly reduced. This strategy can be applied to many areas, such as security surveillance, etc. It is even more interesting when the camera need to be controlled in order to perform a certain task, such as searching for
