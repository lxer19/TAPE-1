Abstract: Gregory Bateson maintains that individual development and natural evolution follow the same principles; thus he parallels learning and evolution. I try to establish the precise mechanism in the case of human learning, by attributing to concepts the role of genes: We develop our thoughts conceptually through selection in the same way as living beings develop genetically. Thoughts thus evolve in our mind like fish in a cove, yielding concepts as the genetic material from which new thoughts arise. This puts thinking into contrast to talking, where we build sentences from words like buildings from bricks. Thus, while we represent concepts directly through words, thoughts have to be formulated into, and started from, sentences. Communication involves much choice, and thus chance; how come we relate so well, being so different? How do we share our thoughts if the world is so big? We have to care to keep our systems small, to balance between too big and too small. Otherwise we could not manage in man-made environments. This viewpoint yields consequences for learning and teaching; many of them are known, but may appear now in a new light. Communication is most risky with formal matters; formal concepts are needed to describe machines, and thus have to be developed through artificial breeding. This makes it difficult to do science in a responsible way. Computer scientists get into special trouble: Their task is, so it seems, to reduce any type of communication to electronics; with this megalomaniac goal how can their systems be small? How can they avoid canned fish? They have to gestalt computer assisted systems, that is, to design them in a way as if humans mattered, by balancing between mere interpreting and mere constructing. For this task they need help from the outside: from philosophers, linguists, psychologists, edu-cationers, sociologists. Does this turn (computer) science into utopia? Acknowledgment: I wrote this report while visiting Berkeley, supported by a travel grant of the German Volkswagen Foundation. In the exciting interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Institute of Cognitive Studies what I had learned so far became reshaped, extended, and corrected, and begins to settle down into a new perspective. Among others I thank Hubert Dreyfus and Stephen Palmer for making me come; Eleanor Rosch, George Lakoff, Mark Johnson, and Andrea diSessa, for their courses and seminars; Mark Johnson for reading and discussing with me parts of the present report; Jerome Feldman as my faculty advisor and the International Computer Science Institute, for providing an excellent working environment; and the VW Foundation for their generous support.
