Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.

Reference-contexts: Both are off-line tractable and on-line intractable. However, in moderate systems, planning with complete information is quite trivial (this is the case of graph search <ref> (Aho, Hopcroft, & Ullman, 1974) </ref>), while in that case we show that Planning while Learning is NP-hard. More generally, we obtain a complete classification of Planning while Learning systems based on several representation types and computational categories.

Reference-contexts: This assumption | that the automaton is fully connected | may very well be false in many real-life applications. The part of our work which discusses multi-agent plans is related to issues in distributed AI <ref> (Bond & Gasser, 1988) </ref> and to the complexity of multi-agent planning (Tennenholtz & Moses, 1989); we investigate the computational difficulty that arises due to uncertainty concerning the activities of an additional agent (s). 125 Safra and Tennenholtz As far as related representations are concerned, the model we present is different from

Reference-contexts: This result is quite satisfactory, since quasi-moderate systems are a rich context. For example, some architectures such as the ones discussed by Brooks and his colleagues <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref> can be treated as quasi-moderate systems. They include a polynomial number of sensors, which correspond to an exponential number of possible observations, and are tested against a list of possible environment behaviors (i.e., the appropriate sensor-effector mechanism is checked for a list of environment behaviors). <p> The reactive approach is proposed as a tool in the control of robots operating in uncertain environments, and in the design of real-life control architectures that would be able to react in a satisfactory manner, given unpredicted events <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>. The interleaving of planning and execution may sometimes be a useful alternative to conditional planning. However, in many realistic domains there is a need to consider a whole or large portion of a plan before deciding on an action.

In addition, Tennenholtz and Moses show a reduction from control-theoretic models as the ones we discuss to the more classical STRIPS-like representations (Tennenholtz & Moses, 1989). They show how a typical STRIPS-like representation can be reduced to a quasi-moderate representation.

Reference-contexts: This type of representation has already been used in Rosenschein's situated automata (Rosenschein, 1985) and in work on reasoning about knowledge <ref> (Halpern & Moses, 1984) </ref>. The observable states in the transportation domain example are the locations, and the actual transition function corresponds to the actual routes in the environment.

Reference-contexts: Quasi-Moderate Representations: The number of agent's observable states might be exponential in the size of the system representation, but the number of possible transition functions is at most polynomial in that size. This is a most appealing type of representation for systems with bounded uncertainty <ref> (Halpern & Vardi, 1991) </ref>. The trauma-care system mentioned in Section 2 is an example of a system with a quasi-moderate representation. In such a system we usually have a set of atomic observations (e.g., whether the blood pressure is high or low). <p> As we mentioned before, quasi-moderate systems correspond to complex systems where the number of possible worlds describing the environment is efficiently enumerable. These constitute a rich and appealing family of systems <ref> (Halpern & Vardi, 1991) </ref>. Our results show, for example, that the trauma-care system discussed in the previous section can be built as an expert system that devises the next action to be performed based on the history of observations by the doctor.

Reference-contexts: If the plan is not satisfactory, the efficient verification process locates the failures and informs the designer, who may choose to generate a new plan, etc. This approach was at first made explicit in the AI literature, by the seminal paper of McCarthy and Hayes <ref> (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969) </ref> where it is referred to as the Missouri program. This approach is indeed the one used in many practical situations, such as the ones mentioned in the previous section.

The above model is fundamental and some extensions of it will be discussed in Section 6. Given this model, we are now able to define the basic problem in Planning while Learning.

Reference-contexts: This work may be viewed as a special case of the general framework of Planning while Learning. Work on the design of physical part orienters (belts, panhandlers) that accept an object in one of several possible orientations and output it in a predetermined orientation <ref> (Natarajan, 1986) </ref> may also be viewed as a special case of our framework. Our work is concerned with the off-line and on-line tractability of Planning while Learning. This relates it to work concerned with the tractability of different types of planning (Erol, Nau, & Subrahmanian, 1992; Bylander, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Recall that off-line design and tractability, although considered an attractive option (Mc-Carthy & Hayes, 1969), has been almost neglected in the recent years (but see (Moses & Tennenholtz, 1993; Shoham & Tennenholtz, 1994)). Research on inference of finite-automata <ref> (Rivest & Schapire, 1987, 1989) </ref> assumes an agent that tries to infer the structure of an automaton. The agent is given a limited access to the automaton, and is expected to gain enough information to deduce the complete structure of the automaton.

Reference-contexts: This type of representation has already been used in Rosenschein's situated automata <ref> (Rosenschein, 1985) </ref> and in work on reasoning about knowledge (Halpern & Moses, 1984). The observable states in the transportation domain example are the locations, and the actual transition function corresponds to the actual routes in the environment. <p> Hence, the most appropriate similar model of knowledge representation in AI is the situated automata <ref> (Rosenschein, 1985) </ref>. Notice that, in general, the number of local states an agent might reach is exponential in the number of its observable states. 8. Conclusions A useful planning system needs to have three essential properties. First, it should supply a mechanism for the generation of plans.

Specific mechanisms to construct conditional plans in which observable events and tests are explicitly declared are discussed as well (Wellman, 1990).

Reference-contexts: We are mainly concerned with general computational aspects of Planning while Learning, and classify Planning while Learning based on several computational categories and representation types. Another suggested approach for planning in uncertain environments, whose applicability aroused quite a heated discussion recently, is referred to as universal plans <ref> (Schoppers, 1987) </ref>. A universal plan is one in which the reaction of the agent to every possible event of the environment is specified explicitly. Our results isolate general classes of systems in which the agent's actions can be specified explicitly in an efficient manner, in order to enable automatic verification.

Reference-contexts: The local (or mental) state of an agent, which is the general agent's state discussed in the AI literature <ref> (Shoham, 1990) </ref>, will not be represented explicitly in our representation and will be built implicitly based on the agent's actions and observations. Hence, the most appropriate similar model of knowledge representation in AI is the situated automata (Rosenschein, 1985).
