Abstract: This paper reports on the development of the process-planning module for EDAPS, an integrated system for designing and planning the manufacture of microwave modules. Microwave modules are complex devices having both electrical and mechanical properties, and EDAPS integrates electrical design, mechanical design, and process planning for both the mechanical and electrical domains. EDAPS's process planning module provides an integrated approach to process planning in both the electronic and mechanical domains, specifically in the manufacture of microwave transmit-receive (T/R) modules. It enables EDAPS to generate process plans concurrently with design|and we are developing ways for EDAPS to use the process planning information provide feedback to designers about manufacturability, cost, and lead time for manufacturing their designs. The planning module is based on a modified version of an AI planning methodology called Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. We provide an overview of its operation, and compare and contrast it to how HTN planning is normally done. fl Also in the Institute for Systems Research and the Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland.

Reference-contexts: Tradeoff Analysis. The MSDA advisor [23] evaluates system level trade-offs between physical size, weight, thermal characteristics, reliability, cost, performance, and so forth in the selection of packaging technologies for components used in PCBs and ceramic substrates. The EXTRA system <ref> [2] </ref> does tradeoff analysis for selecting alternative components and subassemblies for microwave modules. MICROWAVE T/R MODULES 5 housing. 3 MICROWAVE T/R MODULES 3.1 Introduction Most commercial electronic products operate in the 10kHz-1GHz radio frequency (RF) spectrum. <p> In fact, processes, components, and board design characteristics all determine the yield of the microwave T/R modules. Ball and others <ref> [2] </ref> consider such interactions between processes and parts, and solve the trade-off analysis as an integer-programming problem. However, they require individual process-component yield values as inputs for their models.

Reference-contexts: Once artwork generation is completed, the system calls an application program that extracts the product information relevant for manufacturing from the design databse, and stores it in C++ classes. Finally, the system translates the layout into an IGES file <ref> [14] </ref>, and exports it to Mi crostation for substrate designing. Step 3 Mechanical design|Substrate Design Module Microstation is then invoked from the user interface. The Microstation kernel reads layout from the IGES file and product information from the C++ classes, and regenerates the artwork as a Microstation design file.

Step 1 Schematic Circuit|Circuit Schematic and Circuit Layout Module For the purpose of illustration, we use the example of a Mixer-IF amplifier circuitry <ref> [17] </ref> shown in Figure 9.
