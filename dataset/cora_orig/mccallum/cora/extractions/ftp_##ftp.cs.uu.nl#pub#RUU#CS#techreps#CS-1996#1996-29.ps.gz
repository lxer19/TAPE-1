Abstract: The classes A r and S r are defined as the classes of those graphs, where the minimum degree greedy algorithm always approximates the maximum independent set (MIS) problem within a factor of r, respectively, where this algorithm has a sequence of choices that yield an output that is at most a factor r from optimal, r 1 a rational number. It is shown that deciding whether a given graph belongs to A r is coNP-complete for any fixed r 1, and deciding whether a given graph belongs to S 1 is DP-hard, and belongs to 2 P. Also, the MIS problem remains NP-complete when restricted to S r . Keywords: Analysis of algorithms, Combinatorial problems, Approximation algorithms

Reference-contexts: We mention that MIS is not approximable within a factor of n 1=3* unless coRP=NP (see <ref> [1] </ref>). 4 4 3 The complexity of recognizing A r In this section we will prove that the recognition of those graphs where the MDG algorithm approximates the maximum independent set with approximation ratio any fixed rational number r 1 is a coNP-complete problem.

Reference-contexts: An example of a DP-complete problem is Exact Vertex Cover, which asks, when given a graph G and a positive integer k, whether the size of the minimum vertex cover in G is exactly k. (See <ref> [3] </ref>.) As the size of the vertex cover of a graph G equals to jV (G)j ff (G), it is clear that the following problem is also DP-complete. Exact Independence Number Instance: A graph G and a positive integer k. <p> Instead, we prove membership in the larger class 2 P. ( 2 P is the class of the problems that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial time oracle machine that uses an NP oracle). (See e.g. <ref> [3, 7] </ref>.) 8 Lemma 4.3 Let r 1 be a rational number. The recognition problem for S r belongs to 2 P. Proof.

Reference-contexts: One can easyly verify that A 1 contains all trees, cycles, split graphs, complete k-partite graphs and complements of k-trees. We also mention that A 1 contains the class of well-covered graphs (the recognition problem of well-covered graphs has been proved to be a coNP-complete problem (see <ref> [4, 5] </ref>)). Also, according to the results in [6], if r +2 3 , then A r contains all the graphs with degree bounded by .

Reference-contexts: For several classes of graphs it is known that, if we require the input to belong to such a class, then MDG has a good approximation ratio; examples are the graphs of bounded degree or bounded average degree <ref> [6] </ref>. Also, MDG is known to output always a maximum independent set, when the input is a well-covered graph (a graph is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same cardinality see [8]). <p> We also mention that A 1 contains the class of well-covered graphs (the recognition problem of well-covered graphs has been proved to be a coNP-complete problem (see [4, 5])).
