Abstract: Consider a system of polynomial equations in n variables of degrees less than d with integer coefficients with the lengths less than M. We show using the construction close to smooth stratification of algebraic varieties that an integer corresponds to these polynomials such that for every prime p the considered system has a solution in the ring of p-adic numbers if and only if it has a solution modulo p N for the least integer N such that p N does not divide . This improves the previously known result by B. J. Birch and K.

Reference-contexts: The proof of Theorem 1 is based on the construction which iterates the decomposition of a given algebraic variety into the union of irreducible components and taking the proper closed subset containing all singular points of a component. So the results of <ref> [2] </ref> is used for the proof. But for recursive estimations we need to prove basing on [2] also some additional facts related to decomposition of algebraic varieties into irreducible components, see Lemma 2. <p> So the results of <ref> [2] </ref> is used for the proof. But for recursive estimations we need to prove basing on [2] also some additional facts related to decomposition of algebraic varieties into irreducible components, see Lemma 2. The construction required for the proof of Theorem 1 is closely related to the smooth stratification of algebraic varieties. So we shall define and consider at first the latter. <p> The polynomial H has the degrees deg u i;0 ;:::;u i;n H = deg V for every i and deg Z 0 ;Z s ;:::;Z n H = deg V , c.f. [4], <ref> [2] </ref>. Let V be an irreducible component of the algebraic variety Z (f 1 ; : : : ; f k ). <p> is O (n 2 log (deg V + 1)) for all i; j and if Y A i;j then R H (D; Z s ; : : : ; Z n ) 6= 0: (4) The construction of system of polynomial equations for the components of an algebraic variety from <ref> [2] </ref> and (4) imply that the lengths of integer coefficients of the polynomial H (D; Z 0 ; Z s ; : : : ; Z n ) are bounded from above by (M +n 2 )P (d s ). <p> Let us show that one can construct the polynomial H within the time polynomial in M , d s , (deg V + 1) n 2 . Indeed, it is sufficient using <ref> [2] </ref> to construct a generic point of V within the time polynomial in M , d s and n. <p> So #E P ((deg V + 1) n ) for a polynomial P. We have, c.f. the construction of the system of polynomial equations for the components of an algebraic variety from <ref> [2] </ref>, Z (H e ; e 2 E) = V . Thus, if the polynomial H is known then one can construct within the polynomial time the system of homogeneous polynomial equations giving V . <p> all the elements = Y =U 0 and L i =U 0 , 0 i n are primitive elements of the extension K (V ) oe K (U s+1 =U 0 ; : : :; U n =U 0 ): For every 0 i n factor using the algorithm from <ref> [2] </ref> the polynomial i over the field K (U s+1 =U 0 ; : : : ; U n =U 0 )[] and construct the generic point O i = (L i =U 0 )j V 2 K (U s+1 =U 0 ; : : : ; U n =U 0 <p> So we can write O i;j = O i;j (U 0 ; U s+1 ; : : : ; U n ): According to the algorithm for factoring polynomials from <ref> [2] </ref> the degrees of numerators and denominators (they belong to Z [U 0 ; U 0 ; U s+1 ; : : : ; U n ]) of all O i;j relative to every U i , i = 0; s + 1; : : : ; n, and every u <p> Since W 1 is a component of st (W 2 ) the polynomial H 1 coincides with an irreducible factor of F 2 (0; Z 0 ; Z s+1 ; : : : ; Z n ). &gt;From the described construction using <ref> [2] </ref> and the ascertained estimations for degrees and lengths of integer coefficients of O i;j we get immediately (6). The lemma is proved. 11 Now our aim is to prove Theorem 2. <p> In what follows when it is required to construct a system of polynomial equations for any affine algebraic variety U ae A n (Q) we shall construct system of homogeneous polynomial equations corresponding to the generic projection of its closure in U ae P n (Q) by Lemma 2 and <ref> [2] </ref>.
