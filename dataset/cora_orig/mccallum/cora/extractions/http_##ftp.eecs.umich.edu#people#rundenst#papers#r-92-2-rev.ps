Abstract: ELKE A. RUNDENSTEINER 1 the user is in charge of constructing local view schemata using the import/export facility of O 2 . Their solution of class integration is a simplistic approach that results in partial rather in complete classification. Their classification refers to select classes, and does not handle hide or join classes.

This paper discusses two components of this environment, namly, it describes two mechanisms for simplifying the specification of views for object-oriented databases (OODBs). This enables the designer of an OODB to design and manage schemas tuned to the need for diverse applications. The resulting view support system represents a powerful tool for usage of OODBS in application domains, since in contrast to relational views, we can customize not only the individual data records, but also the classification hierarchy organizing the relevant information as well as the operations to be performed on the database. While a relational view corresponds to a set of `unrelated' base and virtual relations, an object-oriented view corresponds to a complex structure of base and virtual classes interrelated via various relationships, such as, the generalization and decomposition hierarchies. We have proposed a methodology, called MultiView, for supporting multiple such object-oriented view schemata which breaks view specification into two tasks: (a) the derivation of virtual classes and their integration into one consistent global schema graph and (b) the specification of arbitrarily complex, yet consistent, view schemata on this augmented global schema. The focus of this paper is on the second, less explored, issue. Unlike for relational views, generalization relationships in object-oriented views must be validated so that they are consistent with the global schema. We solve this problem of consistent view specification by reformulating as a classical graph theory problem, called minimal covering. This then allows us to apply graph-theoretic algorithms, namely transitive reduction, to solve the view problem. Based on this, we describe efficient algorithms (for schema graphs with single and multiple inheritance) that automatically generate a complete, minimal and consistent view schema. Proofs of correctness and complexity analysis of these algorithms are given. The presented solution simplifies the task of the view definer by automating the more tedious tasks of view specification, and, in addition, enforces the consistency of the resulting view.
