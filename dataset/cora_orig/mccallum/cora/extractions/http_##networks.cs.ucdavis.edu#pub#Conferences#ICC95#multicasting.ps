Abstract: A wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) based multicast-ing protocol for a single-hop broadcast-and-select local light-wave network is proposed. Our approach employs a control-channel-based media-access protocol that schedules multicast packets while incorporating arbitrary transceiver tuning times and propagation delays. An arbitrary number of data channels (W ) supply communication bandwidth to N nodes, where N W . An additional control channel is used for synchronization and scheduling. Each node is equipped with one fixed transmitter and one fixed receiver on the control channel, as well as one tunable (wavelength-agile) transmitter and one or more tunable receivers for data channel access. Results suggest that WDM single-hop multicasting experiences very good performance when multicast size is either small or very large, or when nodes are equipped with multiple receivers.

The lower bound on the total packet delay is derived as follows. We assume light system load (queueing occurs for access to the control channel, but access to data channels is immediate. <p> Again, we see a range of values of L in which the maximum receiver throughput experiences a local minimum, but this minimum is much less severe than that of the system in which there is one receiver per node.

Non-negligible transceiver tuning time and non-zero propagation delays are considered. We have shown that high throughputs can be achieved while requiring a reasonable amount of processing per node.

Reference-contexts: The control channel is the main bottleneck of the system when P is small, which limits data channel throughput. This situation can be remedied by using a con trol channel with a higher bitrate (see reference <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion of this phenomenon). throughput for the same system, except that the packet size is fixed at 500 bits and the transmitter and receiver tun ing times are varied (but they are assumed to be equal, viz. T = T t = T r ).
