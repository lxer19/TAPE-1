Abstract: The concept of informational independence plays a key role in most knowledge-based systems. J. Pearl and his co-researchers have analysed the basic properties of the concept and have formulated an axiomatic system for informational independence. This axiomatic system focuses on independences among mutually disjoint sets of variables. We show that in the context of probabilistic independence a focus on disjoint sets of variables can hide various interesting properties. To capture these properties, we enhance Pearl's axiomatic system with two additional axioms. We investigate the set of models of the thus enhanced system and show that it provides a better characterisation of the concept of probabilistic independence than Pearl's system does. In addition, we observe that both Pearl's axiomatic system and our enhanced system offer inference rules for deriving new independences from an initial set of independence statements and as such allow for a normal form for representing independence. We address the normal forms ensuing from the two axiomatic systems for informational independence.

Reference-contexts: A well-known example of a joint probability distribution embedding a functional dependence from the literature on Bayesian belief networks is the probability distribution of the Visit-to-Asia example first introduced by S.L. Lauritzen and D.J. Spiegelhalter <ref> [Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter, 1988] </ref>. In this section, we reconsider independence relations of joint probability distributions that may embed functional dependences; in doing so, we once more examine their independence statements that involve overlapping sets of variables.

Reference-contexts: Despite these definitional differences, the various perspectives on informational independence share the same basic properties. The basic properties of informational independence have been identified and taken to constitute an axiomatic system for informational independence by J. Pearl and his co-researchers <ref> [Pearl, 1988, Pearl et al., 1990] </ref>. There are many advantages to an axiomatic system for informational independence. Such a system for example offers inference rules for computing new independence statements from an initial set of statements. <p> These advantages fall in with the advantages of axiomatisation in gener-al. The impact of Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence is most clearly demonstrated in the context of probability theory, as it underlies the formalism of Bayesian belief networks for reasoning with uncertainty in knowledge-based systems <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence focuses on independences among mutually disjoint sets of variables. In the context of probability theory, however, the concept of informational independence is not restricted to mutually disjoint sets of variables. <p> observations, Pearl argues that the concept of independence is far more basic to human reasoning than its numerical definition suggests and that in fact the definition of independence in terms of probabilities may be looked upon as a quantitative way of capturing the basic concept which is qualitative in nature <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Pearl's aim in designing an axiomatic system now is to provide an explicit qualitative definition of independence. We begin our review of Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence by introducing some notational convention. <p> Note that in the previous definition we have expressed the concept of (conditional) independence from probability theory in the Bayesian formalism, thereby closely following Pearl <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. From now on, we will write I Pr (X; Z; Y ) to denote (X; Z; Y ) 2 I Pr and :I Pr (X; Z; Y ) to denote (X; Z; Y ) 62 I Pr , for short. <p> The properties stated in Theorem 2.2 are easily verified from the basic axioms of probability theory. We would like to note that we have stated the properties in the theorem to hold for mutually disjoint sets of variables only <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. These properties, however, also hold for overlapping sets of variables; we will return to this observation in the following section. Pearl now takes the properties stated in Theorem 2.2 as axioms for the qualitative concept of informational independence [Pearl, 1988]. <p> theorem to hold for mutually disjoint sets of variables only <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. These properties, however, also hold for overlapping sets of variables; we will return to this observation in the following section. Pearl now takes the properties stated in Theorem 2.2 as axioms for the qualitative concept of informational independence [Pearl, 1988]. <p> The axioms described in Definition 2.3 have been proven logically independent <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. The axioms of the axiomatic system for informational independence A with each other convey the idea that learning irrelevant information does not alter the independences among the variables discerned. We consider the qualitative meanings of the various axioms separately. <p> Any model in the set of models [A] of the system A is termed a semi-graphoid independence relation; any model in [A + ] is termed a graphoid independence relation. The terms graphoid and semi-graphoid refer to the representation of independence relations in graphical structures <ref> [Pearl & Paz, 1985, Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Pearl's restricted axiomatic system for informational independence A serves to capture (at least) all independence relations that are embedded in a joint probability distribution; this property is stated more formally in the following lemma. <p> To capture these properties, we include two additional axioms in Pearl's extended axiomatic system for informational independence. 4.1 Strictly Positive Probability Distributions In designing his axiomatic system for informational independence, Pearl has singled out strictly positive joint probability distributions <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. This special attention for strictly positive distributions has resulted in the concept of a graphoid independence relation as a special type of semi-graphoid independence relation. <p> Pearl's extended axiomatic system for informational independence E + has been designed to capture independence relations of strictly positive joint probability distributions <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Unfortunately, the axiomatic system E + does not reflect the property stated in Proposition 4.1. <p> Pearl's extended axiomatic system for informational independence E has been designed to characterise independence relations that may be embedded in a joint probability distribution <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Unfortunately, the axiomatic system E does not reflect the property 13 stated in Proposition 4.6. <p> Pearl builds on the restricted axiomatic system for informational independence A, that is, on the system that involves axioms for mutually disjoint sets of variables only <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. In this section, we address Pearl's restricted focus on disjoint sets of variables in view of such representations.

We would like to note that in relation with graphical representations of independence Pearl and his co-researchers have, informally, pointed out the necessity of explicitly modelling functional dependences <ref> [Pearl et al., 1990] </ref>; our new normal form falls in with and extends on their observations. 6 Conclusions The concept of informational independence has been axiomatised by J. Pearl and his co-researchers.

Reference-contexts: This observation is due to M. Studeny who has been the first to identify an additional, logically independent axiom for semi-graphoid independence relations <ref> [Studeny, 1989] </ref>. From Studeny's observation we have the following lemma. 5 Lemma 2.5 Let P and P + be as before. Furthermore, let [A] and [A + ] be the sets of models of the axiomatic systems A and A + , respectively.

Reference-contexts: Since the introduction of Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence, several new axioms have been identified. In fact, it has been shown that a finite axiomatisation of the concept of probabilistic independence does not exist <ref> [Studeny, 1992] </ref>. The importance of our enhanced axiomatic system in view of this result arises from its allowing for a new normal form for informational independence. <p> Then, * [A] 6 P; We would like to note that it has been shown that a finite axiomatisation of the concept of probabilistic independence does not exist, that is, there does not exist a finite set of axioms X such that [X ] = P <ref> [Studeny, 1992] </ref>. 2.2 Properties of Independence Relations Using Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence, we derive some convenient properties of (semi-graphoid and graphoid) independence relations. The following lemma shows that the symmetry and contraction axioms from the axiomatic system A are easily generalised to bi-implications.
