Title: Diagonal Crossover in Genetic Algorithms for Numerical Optimization  
Author: A.E. Eiben Cees H.M. van Kemenade

Affiliation: Leiden University  CWI,  
Abstract: In this paper the results of a detailed investigation on a multi-parent recombination operator, diagonal crossover, are reported. Although earlier publications have indicated the high performance of diagonal crossover on a number of problems, so far it has not been investigated whether high performance is indeed a result of using a high number of parents. Here we formulate three hypotheses to explain why GA performance increases when more parents are used. Based on an extensive study on a test suite containing eight numerical optimization problems we are able to establish that the higher number of parents is indeed one of the sources of higher performance, if and when this occurs. By the diversity of the test functions (unimodal, multimodal, quasi-random landscapes) we can also make observations on the relationship between fitness landscapes and operator performance.

Reference-contexts: The test suite and the results of the experiments on each test function are presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we evaluate the results and draw conclusions. 2 Multi-parent recombination In evolution strategies (ES) global recombination is a multi-parent operator, <ref> [2, 17] </ref>. This operator creates a new value in the child chromosome based on two parents, but randomly chooses two parents for each variable anew. <p> As default, we use 20 bits for representing a single variable, but deviate from this value for F1, F2 and F8. For F1 and F2 we use the values originating from DeJong, for F8 30 bits are used, following Back, <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The algorithm becomes approximately twice as fast for high N 's as for N = 2. Once again, there is no significant difference between the two diagonal crossovers that both outperform N -point crossover. 4.8 Fletcher-Powell function F8, the Fletcher-Powell function is retrieved from <ref> [2] </ref>: F 8 (~x) = i=1 A i = j=1 B i = j=1 12 where n = 30, n = 30, and x 0 i . <p> The a ij ; b ij 2 f100; : : : ; 100g are random integers, and ff j 2 [; ] is the randomly chosen global optimum position. For the matrices A; B and the vector ~ff we used the values given in <ref> [2] </ref> (pp. 265-267). No runs found the optimum on this function, resulting in constant speed and success rate curves. Accuracy curves reveal differences between performance for different N 's, showing advantageous effects of higher N 's, up to approximately 10.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multi-parent recombination is a new research area within evolutionary computation. Although some researchers have incidentally proposed and applied recombination mechanisms using more parents, <ref> [5, 7, 15] </ref>, the phenomenon of multi-parent recombination has not been given much attention in the past. In this paper we study this phenomenon through investigating the behavior of diagonal crossover (see the definition in Section 2). Our research goals are two-fold. 1.

Reference-contexts: Related work of Beyer, <ref> [6] </ref>, generalizes the traditional ES recombination operators by introducing the number of parents as an independent parameter . The resulting (=; ) evolution strategy is studied for the special case of 2 = and theoretical analysis on the spherical function shows an advantage of using more than two parents.

Reference-contexts: For investigating H 1 we apply the traditional two-parent two-children N -point crossover <ref> [8] </ref>. This operator is well known from the literature, therefore we omit a definition. If N -point crossover exhibits increasing performance when increasing N , (the experimental results reported in [9] make us expect this) then we accept H 1 . <p> Therefore, we accept H 1 and conclude that higher performance partially comes from a higher number of crossover points. Explanations for this fact are the better mixing of information, cf. <ref> [8] </ref>, and the increased macro-mutation-like effects of crossover in case of using higher N 's. Hypothesis H 2 about the advantages of a bigger generational gap is clearly rejected, since the one child and the N children variants of diagonal crossover exhibited the same behavior on each function.

Reference-contexts: This tunability is new feature compared to global recombination and gene pool recombination, where the multi-parent option can only be switched on or off, but it is not scalable. Several studies, cf. <ref> [9, 10, 11, 19] </ref>, have shown that using more than two parents in either crossover mechanism can increase GA performance, although this does not hold for every problem and the two operators can respond differently to increasing the number of parents. <p> For investigating H 1 we apply the traditional two-parent two-children N -point crossover [8]. This operator is well known from the literature, therefore we omit a definition. If N -point crossover exhibits increasing performance when increasing N , (the experimental results reported in <ref> [9] </ref> make us expect this) then we accept H 1 . To test the second hypothesis H 2 , we will apply a slightly modified version of diagonal crossover that creates only one child. The right hand side of Figure 1 illustrates this operator.

Reference-contexts: GPR is showed to be approximately 25% faster than TPR on the ONEMAX problem, and the fuzzyfied GPR outperforms TPR on the spherical function in speed and in realized heritability. The N -parent generalizations of the traditional 1-point crossover and uniform crossover in GAs were introduced in <ref> [10] </ref>. The resulting diagonal, respectively, scanning crossover have the number of parents as parameter, and therefore are tunable on the `extent of sexuality'. <p> This tunability is new feature compared to global recombination and gene pool recombination, where the multi-parent option can only be switched on or off, but it is not scalable.

This operator creates a new value in the child chromosome based on two parents, but randomly chooses two parents for each variable anew. <p> Schwefel briefly touches on this issue in <ref> [17] </ref> stating that `appreciable acceleration' is obtained by changing to bisexual from asexual scheme (i.e. adding recombination using two parents to the mutation-only algorithm), but only `slight further increase' is obtained when changing from `bisexual to multisexual recombination' (i.e. using global recombination instead of the two-parent variant). <p> We can observe that each operator becomes better for higher N 's and that the two diagonal crossovers (identical again) outperform N-point crossover. 11 4.7 Schwefel function F7 is obtained by generalizing Schwefel's 2.26 function (cf. <ref> [17] </ref>, pg. 344): F 7 (~x) = 418:9829n i=1 q where 512:03 x i 511:97. The global minimum of zero is at the point ~x = (420:9687; 420:9687; : : :).

Reference-contexts: By this particular mechanism the number of parents is undefined, thus investigations on the effects of different number of recombinants on algorithm performance could not be performed in the traditional ES framework. (Let us note that in <ref> [18] </ref> an extension of ES is proposed that allows tuning of the number of recombinants.) So far there are almost no experimental results available on the (dis)advantages of global recombination with respect to usual, two-parent recombination.
