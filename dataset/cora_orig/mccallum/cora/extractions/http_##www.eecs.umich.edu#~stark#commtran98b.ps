Title: Turbo Codes for Noncoherent FH-SS with Partial Band Interference  
Author: Joseph H. Kang, Student Member, IEEE and Wayne E. Stark, Fellow, IEEE 
Abstract: In this paper, turbo codes are investigated in a slow frequency-hopped spread spectrum (FH-SS) system with partial-band jamming. In addition, full-band thermal noise is present. The channel model is that of a partial-band jammer in which a fraction of the frequency band is jammed and the remaining fraction is unjammed. This paper focuses on the implemention and performance of a modified turbo decoder for this model. We refer to the knowledge that each transmitted bit is jammed as channel state information. We consider cases of known or unknown channel state and variable number of bits per hop. Our approach is to modify the calculation of branch transition probabilities inherent in the original turbo decoder. For the cases with no side information and multiple bits per hop, we iteratively calculate channel state estimates. Analytical bounds are derived and simulation is performed for noncoherent demodulation. The performance of turbo codes is compared with a Reed-Solomon and a concatenated code comprised of a convolutional inner code and Reed-Solomon outer code.

Reference-contexts: Note that a turbo decoder does not perform maximum likelihood decoding directly, but attempts to achieve maximum likelihood decoding in an iterative way. The original turbo decoder <ref> [1] </ref> used two MAP algorithm decoders. There are other less complex algorithms that can be used in place of the MAP algorithm for each decoder such as SOVA and Max-Log-MAP [5]. However, because these other algorithms are suboptimal, they reduce the complexity of decoding at the cost of performance. <p> II. System Model A. Transmitter The encoder is formed by concatenating two constituent codes in parallel and separating the codes by an interleaver. As in the original work by Berrou et al <ref> [1] </ref>, the constituent codes are recursive systematic convolutional codes.

In general, however, the complexity of maximum likelihood decoding such a code increases exponentially with block length up to the point where decoding becomes physically unrealizable. The encoder mimics random codes by making use of a large random interleaver.

Reference-contexts: The original turbo decoder [1] used two MAP algorithm decoders. There are other less complex algorithms that can be used in place of the MAP algorithm for each decoder such as SOVA and Max-Log-MAP <ref> [5] </ref>. However, because these other algorithms are suboptimal, they reduce the complexity of decoding at the cost of performance. Hence, for the purposes of this paper, we will consider the turbo decoder where each component decoder uses the MAP algorithm to calculate a posteriori likelihood estimates for each bit. <p> The large amount of computation required for turbo decoding explains why much of the current research is focused on reduced complexity decoders <ref> [5] </ref> [7] [8] [9]. In packet data communications, the use of error correction codes plays a key role in achieving low packet error rates. When transmitting speech, large processing delay is unacceptable and higher error rates are tolerable.

Reference-contexts: The MAP decoder is approximately four times more complex than the Viterbi algorithm and this must be iterated several times. It is known that turbo code performance generally increases with interleaver or block length <ref> [6] </ref>. In fact, Berrou et al showed a bit error rate of 10 5 at 0:7 dB, but needed to use 18 decoding iterations and a block length of 65; 536 bits.

Reference-contexts: In this manner, joint decoding and phase tracking can be achieved. In order to gauge our results, we refer to the application of other coding methods to FH-SS systems. In particular, Pursley and Frank investigated the use of the Reed-Solomon code and the Reed-Solomon/convolutional concatenated code (RS-CC) in <ref> [10] </ref>. For the Reed-Solomon code with no inner code, they used a (32; 12) errors-only RS code over GF (2 5 ) with noncoherent reception and 27 codewords per packet. Thus, the code had rate 3=8 and the total number of information bits per packet was 1620.

Reference-contexts: While research on the application of Reed-Solomon codes and concatenated (Reed-Solomon and convolutional) codes to frequency-hopped spread spectrum (FH-SS) systems in partial-band interference have shown promising results [10][12], it would be interesting to see how well turbo codes perform. Turbo codes were first considered for a FH-SS system in <ref> [13] </ref> where performance was analyzed versus spectral efficiency. The model, however, did not include partial-band interference or memory. In [14], turbo codes were considered for coherent FH-SS with partial band interference. In this paper, we investigate the performance of turbo codes in noncoherent FH-SS with partial-band interference.

Reference-contexts: These values are necessary to compute the branch transition probabilities in (2). Note, however, that exact SNR values are not necessary to achieve good decoding performance. By <ref> [17] </ref> and as well by our own investigation, the performance of turbo codes is not sensitive to SNR mismatch. Thus, low complexity SNR estimation algorithms can be implemented to achieve similar performance to the case where the SNR is exactly known. A.

Because square-law combining is suboptimal, an upper bound on its performance will also be an upper bound to the performance of optimal decoding.
