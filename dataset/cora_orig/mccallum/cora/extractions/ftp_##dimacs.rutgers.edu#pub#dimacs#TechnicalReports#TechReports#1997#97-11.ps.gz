Alon [Al96] also proved that if his conjecture is true, then the bound c m log (n=m) in it is optimal up to a constant factor. In this paper, we prove Alon's conjecture by showing the following more general results. Theorem 1 Let 2 k n and 2 m n=2. <p> Set 4 log (en=m): - 3 - As shown in <ref> [Al96, Prop. 3.1] </ref> by a "brute-force" argument, if p 1 then the random graph G n;p satisfies ff (G n;p ) &lt; m with probability bigger than 1 2 . <p> 1 z k 2e k log (en=k) ! z k 1 m=2 q ! z k k ! z = e k log (en=k) z &lt; 2 2 2.2 The case k m It follows from the special case m = k in Section 2.1 (and was also shown in <ref> [Al96] </ref>) that for any s m there is a graph G (s; m) on s vertices with ff (G (s; m)) m having no subgraph on m vertices of density at least 8e 2 log (es=m) m . Let n k m 2. Put s = nm m .
