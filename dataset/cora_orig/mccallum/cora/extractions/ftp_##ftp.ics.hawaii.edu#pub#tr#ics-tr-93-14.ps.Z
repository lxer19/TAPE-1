Reference-contexts: Although schema theory is a psychological framework for explaining how humans construct meanings from written or spoken words, it has been heavily influenced by work in artificial intelligence <ref> [Abe81, SA77] </ref>. In fact, script | the schema about activities and processes | is used both as a knowledge representation scheme for AI programs and in psychological research. Schema-based approaches have been used to study expert-novice differences in reading and understanding text.

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of concept maps in accomplishing these goals seems well supported from field studies <ref> [Cli90, Nov90, RR92, ADS84] </ref>. Nevertheless, as a representation scheme for supporting collaborative learning, concept maps are not adequate (see Section 2.1.4). RESRA is a direct response to such inadequacies.

Reference-contexts: A schema is defined as "a data structure for representing generic concepts in memory" [Rum80]. As such, a schema forms "a building block of cognition" that affects how new information is absorbed as well as how old information is retrieved from memory. Alba and Hasher <ref> [AH83] </ref> identify four main functions of schemas: 181 * Selection: Filtering out certain types of information before passing on to memory representation. * Abstraction: Information reduction by omitting certain types of details. * Interpretation: Inferring missing information based on previous instances of the schema. * Integration: Grouping together related or similar

Reference-contexts: influencing human learning is the learner's prior knowledge; that human learning is evidenced by a change in the meaning of experience (as opposed to a change in behavior); and that the key role of the educator is to help students reflect on their experience and to continuously construct new meanings <ref> [Aus63, ANH78] </ref>. To facilitate this process, Novak and Gowin [NG84] | two of the main proponents of this theory | have developed two meta-cognitive strategies: concept maps and Vee diagrams.

Reference-contexts: Since it is not always possible to study scientists in their working place, scientific text is increasingly being used as a source to study the process of knowledge-building among scientists and the evolution of human knowledge over time <ref> [Sel93, Baz88] </ref> From the learner's perspective, the differentiation of the above functions is significant in two ways. <p> Interest in the rhetorical structure of scientific text has been mounting in recent years <ref> [Baz88, Sel93, Sim90] </ref>. Research efforts have also started in applying the same approach to human learning (e.g., [CSGMW92]). The third type of structure is thematic. As the name implies, the thematic structure characterizes the important features or themes of scientific text, and the relationships between these themes.

Reference-contexts: This view, however, has been challenged by constructivism, a currently dominant paradigm in both the sociology of science and educational research <ref> [BL66, KC81] </ref>. From the constructionist point of view, learning is knowledge-building. Like science, learning involves such activities as problem identification, theorizing, hypothesis formulation and testing, refutation, and so on. <p> Constructionism, which represents one variation of constructivism, holds that knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, is socially constructed <ref> [BL66, KC81] </ref>. Such knowledge is not the same for individuals but is taken-to-be-shared [RR92] with communities of learners. To become a member of such a community, students need to actively engage in interactions and undergo learning situations which allow them to immerse into the discourse practice of a field.

Reference-contexts: The derivation of these primitives is based on several sources, both theoretic and empirical. The main theoretical sources are two: Vee heuristic [NG84] and Bloom's taxonomy <ref> [Blo56] </ref>. The empirical sources include case analyses of the structure of various artifacts and a number of rounds of experimental use of the representation.

Reference-contexts: Some systems, notably ENFI [BPB93], are designed with the goal of creating of a writing community. Hyper-media systems, which are described below, are also used for such purposes (called authoring systems), especially brainstorming, collaborative commenting. Most of existing collaborative writing systems, for instance, PREP [NKCM90, NCK + 92], SASE <ref> [BNPM93] </ref>, WE [SWF87], are intended for professional rather than student writers. It is unclear whether the two are different and, if so, what their differences are. CLARE was not designed to explicitly support collaborative writing. Nevertheless, certain aspects of collaborative writing can benefit from the CLARE approach.

Reference-contexts: The use of computers to support collaborative writing is quite pervasive. Most CMC and virtual classroom systems, for example, support parts of this process, such as information gathering, brainstorming, and collaborative commenting. Some systems, notably ENFI <ref> [BPB93] </ref>, are designed with the goal of creating of a writing community. Hyper-media systems, which are described below, are also used for such purposes (called authoring systems), especially brainstorming, collaborative commenting.

Reference-contexts: What differentiates CSILE from other learning systems is its integration of software and a learning approach that grows out of over a decade of research on intentional learning, knowledge-telling, and transformation in writing <ref> [BS87] </ref>. CSILE represents a joint effort by cognitive scientists, computer scientists, teachers, and students. Empirical findings. CSILE has been used at primary, elementary, and graduate school levels.

Reference-contexts: Like empirical studies, the outcome from an experience paper may be either positive or negative; both are equally valuable. In the case of failure, what is important is the discussion of the possible cause of failure and lessons learned. An example: A good example of the experience paper is <ref> [Bus90] </ref>, which discusses the experience of introducing formal software review to JPL.

Reference-contexts: It has enjoyed a wide acceptance in the educational community. Numerous studies have shown its effectiveness in facilitating student learning in science <ref> [Cli90, Nov90, RR92] </ref>. Despite the strong empirical evidence supporting its usefulness, however, concept mapping as a collaborative learning tool suffers from three main problems: * Non-hierarchical structures: In concept maps, all knowledge features must ultimately be reduced to concepts and links between them. <p> As part of the theoretic formulation, Novak and Gowin [NG84] propose two knowledge representation schemes: concept maps and Vee diagrams. Figure 2.3 shows an example of the concept map. The next section describes concept mapping | a scheme that has been found quite effective in enhancing science teaching <ref> [Cli90, Nov90, RR92] </ref> | from a KR perspective, and identifies the problems that concept mapping shares with semantic networks. 2.1.4 Critiques on concept maps: a KR perspective Concept maps are similar to semantic networks | a widely used KR scheme first proposed by [Qui67] | in that both represent knowledge as <p> The effectiveness of concept maps in accomplishing these goals seems well supported from field studies <ref> [Cli90, Nov90, RR92, ADS84] </ref>. Nevertheless, as a representation scheme for supporting collaborative learning, concept maps are not adequate (see Section 2.1.4). RESRA is a direct response to such inadequacies.

Reference-contexts: As a result, it needs to meet some minimal usability requirements, including: * Abiding by established interface design standards, for example, <ref> [Com87] </ref>; * Response time for interactive commands should be acceptable; and * Examples should be provided whenever possible to show the user the proper way of using the system constructs and functions. 81 In the initial prototype, no attempt is made to offer graphical means of browsing and manipulating RESRA instances.

Reference-contexts: Interest in the rhetorical structure of scientific text has been mounting in recent years [Baz88, Sel93, Sim90]. Research efforts have also started in applying the same approach to human learning (e.g., <ref> [CSGMW92] </ref>). The third type of structure is thematic. As the name implies, the thematic structure characterizes the important features or themes of scientific text, and the relationships between these themes. Two example themes are problem and claim, and an example relationship be tween them might be claim respondsto ! problem. <p> Toulmin's rhetorical model. Figure 7.2 shows another widely used argumentation model proposed by philosopher Stephen Toulmin [Tou58]. The original purpose of this model was for delineating logical structure of an argument, although it is also useful for analyzing scientific controversies (e.g., <ref> [CSGMW92] </ref>). Datum Backing Warrant Rebuttal Claim Toulmin's model suffers from similar problems as IBIS when placed in the CLARE application domain, that is, it is overly coarse-grained. The structure of scientific text varies widely, as shown the example CRFs.

Reference-contexts: AI researchers have developed a large number of techniques and representation schemes which can be readily applied to other contexts, including human learning. In fact, this approach has already been applied to the domains such as design rationale management <ref> [LL91, CY91] </ref>. Second, KR is either ontological or epistemological [Swa90]. In other words, KR concerns the higher-order structure of human knowledge, or meta-knowledge. Many KR schemes, such as frames, semantics nets, Schank's conceptual dependency theory, are themselves examples of meta-structures.

Reference-contexts: The complete CLARE session summary for the current case can be found in Appendix C. 155 6.6.1 Overview of the CLARE session The artifact studied in the current example | "The Automated Requirement Traceability Systems (ARTS): an experience of eight years" by R.F. Flynn and M. Dorfman <ref> [FD90] </ref> | was from the designated readings for ICS613 ("advanced software engineering"). It represents one important type of research literature found in software engineering, i.e., case studies, which typically reports the experience related to technology or methodology adoption in a given organizational context. <p> Chris Chris' summarization of <ref> [FD90] </ref> consists of 17 nodes: 4 problem , 3 claim , 6 concept , 2 theory , 1 method , and 1 evidence , respectively. Overall, these nodes together captured most of main thematic features of the paper. <p> In other words, the author uses the flexibility and inflexibility of ARTS and resulted benefits/difficulties as evidence to support the claim that requirement management tools have to be flexible. It is apparent that Scott mis-construed the intended thesis of the paper. 164 Mary Mary's summarization of <ref> [FD90] </ref> consists of 12 nodes: 4 problem , 3 claim , 1 concept , 1 method , 1 theory , and 1 other , respectively. <p> The node "future directions" 165 (concept576), in fact, contains a number of less substantiated claims that are intended for future researchers on the subject. An example of such claims is that hypertext is a promising technology for enhancing requirement traceability. Todd Todd's representation of <ref> [FD90] </ref> consists of 16 nodes: 3 problem , 4 claim , 5 method , 3 thing , and 1 other . The three problem he identified are: "requirement traceability" (problem466), "major problems with RM" (problem532), and "difficulties and limitations" (problem594). <p> Since Todd created no tuples in his summarization, his perspective on how the above nodes are related to one another cannot be assessed. Summary The above analysis of the summarization result of <ref> [FD90] </ref> by Scott, Chris, Mary, and Todd demonstrates a wide variety in the learners' understanding of both the content of the paper and the representation language. It also shows major differences and similarities between the four representations and points of view.

Reference-contexts: Over years, a number of courses have been taught using Intermedia. However, very few empirical reports on the system can be found in the published literature. 190 NoteCards. NoteCards, developed at Xerox PARC, is perhaps one of the most widely acclaimed hypermedia systems <ref> [Hal87, Tri88, TI87, MI89] </ref>. The system was originally intended to support tasks related to design of information systems, such as information gathering and organization. It was later extended to provide multi-user features, such as allowing more than one user working on the same notefile at the same time.

Reference-contexts: For example, computer-mediated communication systems, such as EIES <ref> [Hil88] </ref>, have been successfully used to overcome the same-time, same-place constraints of traditional classrooms, and to increase student participation outside physical classrooms. Similarly, hyper-media systems, such as Intermedia [YHMD88] and NoteCards [HMT87], have been found effective for browsing and navigating large shared information space. <p> The latter also provides such functions as instruction management tools (assignment tracking, grading, etc.) <ref> [Hil88] </ref>. VC systems possess the following main features: * Access orientation. VC systems enable learners to transcend the geographical and temporal limitations of face-to-face meetings and allow them interact with one an other asynchronously. * Affordable technology. VC systems do not require sophisticated hardware and software technology. <p> An inexpensive home computer equipped with a modem and com munication software is often sufficient. The combination of the above two features has made VC one of the most successfully and pervasively used collaborative learning systems. The remaining section summarizes empirical findings on one virtual classroom system called EIES <ref> [Hil88] </ref>. Findings on EIES. EIES (Electronic Information Exchange System), developed at New Jersey Institute of Technology, represents one of the earliest large-scale studies of the impact of computer conferencing and computer-mediated communication on student learning.

Reference-contexts: For example, computer-mediated communication systems, such as EIES [Hil88], have been successfully used to overcome the same-time, same-place constraints of traditional classrooms, and to increase student participation outside physical classrooms. Similarly, hyper-media systems, such as Intermedia [YHMD88] and NoteCards <ref> [HMT87] </ref>, have been found effective for browsing and navigating large shared information space. <p> The previous section offers a short-term solution by incorporating a graphical browser that supplements the current buffer-based interface. In a long run, CLARE needs to move toward a complete graphical interface, similar to systems such as NoteCards <ref> [HMT87] </ref>. Furthermore, to realize the representational potentials of RESRA requires support for automatic graph layout, visualization, and animation. For example, with visualization capabilities, learners will be able see the overall structure of an artifact, and the structure of each learner's representation.

In fact, this approach has already been applied to the domains such as design rationale management <ref> [LL91, CY91] </ref>. Second, KR is either ontological or epistemological [Swa90]. In other words, KR concerns the higher-order structure of human knowledge, or meta-knowledge.

It has enjoyed a wide acceptance in the educational community. Numerous studies have shown its effectiveness in facilitating student learning in science [Cli90, Nov90, RR92]. <p> It has evolved at Cornell University over the past three decades <ref> [Aus63, NG84] </ref>. The thrust of the theory is its emphasis on the importance of meta-learning, that is, learning how to learn, and the role of the meta-knowledge in human learning. The basic tenets of this theory include: 1. <p> In addition, KR schemes, which are called meta-cognitive tools by educational researchers, are the standard language for characterizing both knowledge structures and corresponding cognitive structures. They help the learner differentiate and organize newly acquired meanings. As part of the theoretic formulation, Novak and Gowin <ref> [NG84] </ref> propose two knowledge representation schemes: concept maps and Vee diagrams. Figure 2.3 shows an example of the concept map. <p> scholars concepts concepts extinction principles idiosyncratic subsumers evolve integrative reconciliation progressive differentiation theories superordinate learning Toulmin described-by involves may-undergo combined-in invent/ modify invent construct held-as contributes-to leads-to can-be is-linked-to with may requires undergo hence-called requires interact-with described-by represented-by Gowin's Vee Ausubel perspective of the assimilation theory of cognitive learning (from <ref> [NG84] </ref>) 30 color blueCar is Car blue A simple semantic net A simple concept map found way. <p> A detailed description of RESRA constructs is provided in Chapter 3. 36 of RESRA node types, and Figure 3.1 and 3.2 for link types). The derivation of these primitives is based on several sources, both theoretic and empirical. The main theoretical sources are two: Vee heuristic <ref> [NG84] </ref> and Bloom's taxonomy [Blo56]. The empirical sources include case analyses of the structure of various artifacts and a number of rounds of experimental use of the representation. <p> It has evolved and been tested at Cornell University over the past three decades <ref> [Aus63, NG84] </ref>. The thrust of this theory is the emphasis on meta-learning, that is, learning how to learn, and the role of the meta-knowledge in human learning. <p> The latter refers to the fact that meaningful learning is enhanced when the learner recognizes new relationships between related concepts and propositions. To assess what a learner already knows and how it changes over time, Novak and Gowin <ref> [NG84] </ref> propose two meta-cognitive tools, 180 called concept maps and Vee diagrams, both of which are described in the following sec- tion. <p> Concept maps and Vee diagrams are two meta--cognitive tools proposed by educational theorists to (1) assess what the learner already knows; (2) discern changes over time in the learner's knowledge structure; and (3) facilitate meaningful learning <ref> [NG84] </ref>. The effectiveness of concept maps in accomplishing these goals seems well supported from field studies [Cli90, Nov90, RR92, ADS84]. Nevertheless, as a representation scheme for supporting collaborative learning, concept maps are not adequate (see Section 2.1.4). RESRA is a direct response to such inadequacies. <p> The novelty and contribution of this system reside in the following features: * CLARE is grounded in a well-established learning theory. The design of the system is based on the theory of cognitive learning that is successfully applied to traditional classroom settings over the past three decades <ref> [NG84] </ref>. One main benefit of such an approach is the consistency and comparability it permits with existing practice and other systems that share the same theoretic principles.

As the name implies, the thematic structure characterizes the important features or themes of scientific text, and the relationships between these themes.

Reference-contexts: AI researchers have developed a large number of techniques and representation schemes which can be readily applied to other contexts, including human learning. In fact, this approach has already been applied to the domains such as design rationale management [LL91, CY91]. Second, KR is either ontological or epistemological <ref> [Swa90] </ref>. In other words, KR concerns the higher-order structure of human knowledge, or meta-knowledge. Many KR schemes, such as frames, semantics nets, Schank's conceptual dependency theory, are themselves examples of meta-structures. <p> RESRA belongs to the content theory of knowledge representation; it concerns the type of knowledge that needs to be represented but not how this knowledge is used by human learners <ref> [Swa90] </ref>. Two major criticisms have been raised on the content theory: one is related to the large amount of efforts often required to translate, for example, a sentence into the underlying representation. Furthermore, the mapping from the text under study into the primitives is usually not unique. <p> The existence of these individual differences is a prerequisite for group synergy. The first problem (i.e., time-consuming), however, still exists in RESRA. The second criticism is that primitives supplied by the content theory is usually incomplete with respect to the world it attempts to model <ref> [Swa90] </ref>. <p> In that setting, it is possible to adopt a bottom-up approach to knowledge, starting from the actual event/object under study. This approach, however, is not applicable to CLARE, since CLARE treats scientific text as the primary source of knowledge. Because scientific artifacts are episodic in nature <ref> [Swa90] </ref>, artifact A may cover only the left side of the Vee, or even only the upper left portion of the Vee, while artifact B may cover the right side of the Vee.

Reference-contexts: Hyper-media systems, which are described below, are also used for such purposes (called authoring systems), especially brainstorming, collaborative commenting. Most of existing collaborative writing systems, for instance, PREP [NKCM90, NCK + 92], SASE [BNPM93], WE <ref> [SWF87] </ref>, are intended for professional rather than student writers. It is unclear whether the two are different and, if so, what their differences are. CLARE was not designed to explicitly support collaborative writing. Nevertheless, certain aspects of collaborative writing can benefit from the CLARE approach.

Reference-contexts: However, they do not represent the content itself. Presentational structures are standardized through stylistic guidelines established for a given discipline or journal. The second type of structure is rhetorical, which concerns the way in which scientific arguments are presented, supported, and refuted. Rhetorical models, such as the one by <ref> [TRJ84] </ref>, provide a viable means of understanding competing formulations or explanations about a given phenomenon. In particular, they are useful for representing interrelationships among different artifacts, and the evolution of scientific formulations over time.

Reference-contexts: Skilled readers, on the other hand, recognize patterns/schemas that relate different parts of the text into a coherent whole. Their strategies include searching the text for its underlying structure, identifying the major text schema, and formulating relational links between major and subordinate ideas <ref> [vDK83, VTY83] </ref>. Schema theory and the above empirical findings are directly relevant to CLARE: RESRA, for example, might be viewed as a set of schemas for characterizing the deep structure of scientific text.

The first concerns the accessibility of the chosen platform.

Reference-contexts: Despite the above differences, concept maps share certain problems with semantic nets. One such a criticism concerns their semantics: although different types of nodes and links are used in semantic networks, their exact semantics are often not specified or left ambiguous <ref> [Woo85] </ref>. The simple network in Figure 2.4, for example, may mean either the definition of the concept of a blue car, or the assertion that some car is blue.
