Abstract: ii) Give an example of a map in Top (the category of topological spaces) which is an epi and a mono, but not an isomorphism. [Hint: Consider two different topologies on one set X so that the identity map induces a continuous map which is not invertable in the category of topological spaces.] Exercise 1.2 We saw that in many concrete categories the notions mono and injective coincide. This is not always the case: A group G is called abelian if g ffi h = h ffi g for all elements g; h 2 G. (One usually writes composition in such groups as +.) Such a group is called divisible if for all integers n the homomorphism n (): G ! G; g 7! ng = g + g + + g
