Reference-contexts: The Shastra project [2] at Purdue is directed at research in computer supported cooperative work such as geometric modeling, simulation, interrogative visualization and design prototyping environments. That system runs on a multimedia desktop. The system detailed in <ref> [1] </ref> combines the ideas of distributed virtual environments and collaboration. That system allows users to cooperate on furniture placement for interior design but lacks representations of the users within the virtual space.

Reference-contexts: PREVIOUS WORK A large number of research groups share our goal of being able to collaborate across wide distances using computer technology. An exhaustive list of related work would be prohibitively long, so we mention here only some of the more relevant work. The Shastra project <ref> [2] </ref> at Purdue is directed at research in computer supported cooperative work such as geometric modeling, simulation, interrogative visualization and design prototyping environments. That system runs on a multimedia desktop. The system detailed in [1] combines the ideas of distributed virtual environments and collaboration.

Reference-contexts: In view of the substantial benefits and economies that a fully functioning system could provide, we feel that it is important to fully develop and test out the concepts. 8. FUTURE WORK The authors are looking into ways of dealing with communication latency <ref> [3] </ref>. Several other methods of interacting during collaboration are also being considered: pointing to objects, shared whiteboards, and audio feedback. One piece of future work is to make this a truly shared collaborative environment where multiple participants can change the model.

Reference-contexts: Unchanging images can convey information, but rarely give subtle nuances like a frown or a confused expression. To help convey these nonverbal cues, vrapp incorporates "animated textures." This feature employs a wrapper around a network video tool called vic <ref> [4] </ref> to provide texture-mapped video from a remote source. With this feature a video stream can be brought into the environment. The system uses this to map a live video feed onto one of the avatars.

Reference-contexts: FUNCTIONALITY Two primary goals of vrapp are to provide a viable environment for collaborative design and to give a better sense of presence among colleagues at a distance. For design, the vrapp system interfaces to Alpha_1 <ref> [5] </ref>, the University of Utah's system for geometric modeling, visualization, and manufacturing. In Alpha_1s suite of tools, models are parameterized according to their design features. The vrapp system currently allows one user to control an Alpha_1 model. That user can highlight and modify parts of the assembly.

Reference-contexts: IMPLEMENTATION The implementation of vrapp emerged from the following specific software goals: rapid development easy integration of code from different sites and from public domain sources extensible, dynamically loaded modules for behavior In order to realize these goals, the schools chose Open Inventor <ref> [6] </ref> as a prototyping platform. Open Inventor is a software package from Silicon Graphics, Inc., that provides flexible scene modeling in OpenGL, a standard graphics library. Scenes in Open Inventor are modeled with a graph of nodes that can describe geometry, material properties, lights, and cameras.

Reference-contexts: That system allows users to cooperate on furniture placement for interior design but lacks representations of the users within the virtual space. The ATR group in Japan has used wide-projection screens to deliver video to a participant in a shared design system <ref> [7] </ref>. They simulated the facial expressions of one of the participants by warping the geometry of that participant's face (captured with a laser scanner offline) according to the movement of tracked dots on that person's face.
