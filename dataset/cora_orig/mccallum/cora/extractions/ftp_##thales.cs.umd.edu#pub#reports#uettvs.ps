Abstract: Esprit is an algorithm for determining the fixed directions of arrival of a set of narrowband signals at an array of sensors. Unfortunately, its computational burden makes it unsuitable for real time processing of signals with time-varying directions of arrival. In this work we develop a new implementation of esprit that has potential for real time processing. It is based on a rank-revealing urv decomposition, rather than the eigendecomposition or singular value decomposition used in previous esprit algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on simulated data representing both constant and time-varying signals. We find that the urv-based esprit algorithm is effective for estimating time-varying directions-of-arrival at considerable computational savings over the svd-based algorithm. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The esprit algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> is a method for determining directions-of-arrival (doa) of a set of narrowband signals impinging on an array of m sensors. It handles array geometries almost as general as those of the music algorithm [2] at a significant computational savings. <p> Boman, Griffin, and Stewart [6] have already exploited this fact to accelerate the music algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of the urv decomposition in time-varying signal processing using esprit. 2. The ESPRIT Algorithm Roy and Kailath <ref> [1] </ref> noted that the esprit idea is independent of the choice of matrix decompositions used in its implementation. In this section we discuss alternatives for these decompositions. 2.1. <p> We use a five-pair (m = 10) linear array with pair spacing =4. The pairs are equally spaced on a line with relative locations <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4] </ref> . The two signals are narrow-band with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 23dB and 20dB, respectively. The noise is white Gaussian, and the algorithms were tested with duplicate data samples in order to make a fair comparison.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The esprit algorithm [1] is a method for determining directions-of-arrival (doa) of a set of narrowband signals impinging on an array of m sensors. It handles array geometries almost as general as those of the music algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> at a significant computational savings. A key limitation of both the music and esprit algorithms is the work required to process a new sample. At the heart of the algorithms is the separation of the m dimensional sample space into an approximate signal subspace and an approximate noise subspace. <p> We use a five-pair (m = 10) linear array with pair spacing =4. The pairs are equally spaced on a line with relative locations <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4] </ref> . The two signals are narrow-band with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 23dB and 20dB, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these decompositions require O (m 3 ) operations to update, making the algorithms unsuitable for real-time computation.

Reference-contexts: Some attempts have been made to reduce the updating complexity by maintaining an approximate singular value decomposition (e.g., [3, 4]), but we believe that better results can be obtained using an alternate decomposition. Recently, Stewart <ref> [5] </ref> has introduced the rank-revealing urv decomposition, a new matrix decomposition that produces the signal and noise subspaces, but can be updated in O (m 2 ) time sequentially and in O (m) time on an array of m processors.

Reference-contexts: This means that algorithms that previously depended on eigendecomposition or singular value decomposition may now be practical in real time applications, provided the urv decomposition can be successfully substituted. Boman, Griffin, and Stewart <ref> [6] </ref> have already exploited this fact to accelerate the music algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of the urv decomposition in time-varying signal processing using esprit. 2.

Reference-contexts: Even with these economies, the svd esprit algorithm is expensive, requiring the O (m 3 ) solution of an eigenvalue problem with each snapshot. Unfortunately, updating the eigendecomposition results in another O (m 3 ) algorithm, though the order constant is smaller <ref> [7] </ref>. Recently techniques for approximately updating an eigendecomposition have been proposed [3, 4], and they show some promise. However, in this paper we consider an alternative decomposition that can be updated in O (m 2 ) time. 2.3.

Reference-contexts: sine of the largest canonical angle between the svd noise space and the urv noise space is bounded by t 1 kGk 2 2 min ( ~ R) where min denotes the smallest singular value and the quantity in parentheses in the denominator is assumed to be less than one <ref> [8] </ref>. Thus, although both bases are only approximations to the true basis, they are close to each other. <p> Suppose that in (2.14) we have partitioned so that G has dimension k. Denote the smallest eigenvalues of XX H by i , i = 1; :::; k, and denote the eigenvalues of G H G by ^ i . Then Mathias and Stewart <ref> [8] </ref> have shown that i = (1 t i ) ^ i ; (2.20) where 0 t i min ( ~ R) urv esprit 9 where t is defined in (2.15).

Reference-contexts: The updating procedure consists of two parts: an incorporation step and a deflation step. The incorporation is analogous to the standard update of a QR decomposition <ref> [9] </ref>; however, special care is taken that only the first column of F and G increases in norm. This corresponds to the fact that the addition of a row to a matrix can increase its rank by at most one.

Reference-contexts: This corresponds to the fact that the addition of a row to a matrix can increase its rank by at most one. After the update, a condition estimator <ref> [10] </ref> is used to test ~ R for rank degeneracy, and a deflation step reduces the norm of the last column of ~ R. If a degeneracy is detected, a refinement step is performed to bring the decomposition closer to diagonal form.

Reference-contexts: If the variance of the noise is not known, or if the signals are moving rapidly, then the above procedure is no longer justified. Alternate schemes such as the well-known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Minimum Description Length (MDL) approaches <ref> [19] </ref> can be incorporated to obtain a better estimate of d at the expense of additional computations. The use of parametric methods [20] can provide even better performance.
