Title: Testable Algorithms for Self-Avoiding Walks  
Author: Dana Randall Alistair Sinclair 
Abstract: We present a polynomial time Monte Carlo algorithm for almost uniformly generating and approximately counting self-avoiding walks in rectangular lattices Z d . These are classical problems that arise, for example, in the study of long polymer chains. While there are a number of Monte Carlo algorithms used to solve these problems in practice, these are heuristic and their correctness relies on unproven conjectures. In contrast, our algorithm depends on a single, widely-believed conjecture that is weaker than preceding assumptions, and, more importantly, is one which the algorithm itself can test. Thus our algorithm is reliable, in the sense that it either outputs answers that are guaranteed, with high probability, to be correct, or finds a counter-example to the conjecture.

Reference-contexts: These are the first polynomial time algorithms where the statistical errors are rigorously controlled. Our algorithms are based on modifications and extensions of a Monte Carlo approach studied originally by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [2] </ref>. In the next subsection we sketch this approach and point out its limitations. <p> The above type of Markov chain was considered by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [2] </ref>, who used a single parameter fi 1 to control the relative probabilities of extending or contracting the walk by one edge. Given a walk of length i, one of the 2d lattice edges incident to the free endpoint of the walk is chosen with equal probability. <p> Thus we require no prior knowledge of fi . Second, we show that, while the efficiency of our Markov chain simulation y Actually, these transition probabilities are a slightly simplified version of those used in <ref> [2] </ref>, but this difference is inessential to the behavior of the chain. is still based on an assumption (conjecture C2, defined below), this is weaker than conjecture C1 and, more importantly, is tested in advance by the algorithm in the region in which it is being assumed. <p> In the case that fi 1 = ::: = fi n 1 this is just the Markov chain used by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [2] </ref>, but truncated at level n. It is evident that the Markov chain M n is irreducible (all states communicate) and aperiodic. This implies that it is ergodic, i.e., it converges asymptotically to a well-defined equilibrium or stationary distribution n over X n . <p> This might be far more efficient than basing the number of simulation steps on some proven, but potentially loose, upper bound g (n) . The idea of a tester has been used before, but in a much more restrictive sense. For example, Berretti and Sokal <ref> [2] </ref> propose testing possible "errors in scaling" due to the conjecture that f (n) An fl1 by trying other specific polynomial forms for f (n) . This gives evidence that f (n) might be of the correct form, but falls short of proving it probabilistically.

The appropriate version of this bound can be found by combining Proposition 1 and Corollary 6 of [19] and is stated precisely in the theorem below.

Reference-contexts: Thus although the algorithmic results we present in this paper will be stated for arbitrary dimensions d, they are of greatest interest in the case of low-dimensional lattices with 2 d 4 . One key fact that holds in all dimensions was discovered in 1954 by Hammersley and Morton <ref> [8] </ref>; they 1 observed that lim n!1 c 1=n n = exists, and that n c n = n f (n) , where lim n!1 f (n) 1=n = 1 .

(See <ref> [16] </ref> for a detailed summary of numerical estimates.) Much effort has been invested in obtaining statistical estimates of the above quantities using Monte Carlo simulations. However, the error bars on these estimates are only justified heuristically. In this paper, we attempt to put such experiments on a firmer footing. <p> This leads to circularity, since determining is one of the principal goals of the algorithm. While many similar Monte Carlo algorithms have been used to study self-avoiding walks (see Chapter 9 of <ref> [16] </ref> for a summary), all of these suffer from a similar lack of rigorous justification, and thus offer no guarantee that their results are reliable. 1.3 Our results In this paper we develop a Monte Carlo algorithm for self-avoiding walks by modifying the Markov chain used by Berretti and Sokal so

Reference-contexts: Ideally, the value we want for fi i is the ratio c i1 =c i . (The fact that this ratio is always strictly less than 1 was proven surprisingly recently by O'Brien <ref> [17] </ref>.) Of course, this is unrealistic since we do not know the quantities c i1 and c i |indeed, these are precisely what we are trying to compute|but we will see in section 2.3 how to determine good approximations to these ideal values before they are needed.
