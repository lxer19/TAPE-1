Reference-contexts: Intuitively, points with similar colors have similar attribute values for a given dimension. Conversely, points with dissimilar colors differ significantly for the dimension being depicted. A similar meaning is applied to the relative distance from a reference point. The Star Field visualization <ref> [1, 2, 23] </ref> technique also depicts tuples as points coupled with the ability to manipulate the display via sliders which control the attribute values. Another approach [4] utilizes movable lenses over a graphical display to improve information gain.

This function is similar to "brushing" techniques [3]. The filters are movable by clicking and dragging within the rectangular region, allowing a user to compare the filtered and unfiltered regions <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. Alternatively, the user may resize the filter to completely overlay the original visualization.

Reference-contexts: One approach to this problem is to smooth the data, either through the use of mean or median rendering techniques [25, 22]. Another approach to dealing with the crowdedness problem is to use larger symbols to signify the existence of more instances at a given point <ref> [5] </ref>. This approach, however, introduces an occlusion problem, with larger points occupying more display real estate and the subsequent obscuring of closer, smaller points. Keahey and Robertson [16, 17] suggest that the use of non-linear magnification techniques can alleviate the crowdedness and the occlusion problem.

Reference-contexts: Our visual data mining approach is consistent with the commonly-used definition for data mining applications: the exploration and discovery of facts contained within a vast database of information <ref> [8, 6] </ref>. Prior to the advent of data mining techniques, discovering these "hidden" facts using traditional database analysis methods would have been an unlikely occurrence. Of course, data mining is an analysis technique as such it should not be confused with methods for updating the database of information.

Reference-contexts: Symbolic visualization techniques (sometimes called iconographic) approach the problem of visualizing multiple dimensions through the use of symbols or icons representing particular attribute combinations. Chernoff proposed the use of faces, specifically, facial shapes and expressions as a means to display multi-dimensional data <ref> [24, 7] </ref>. In this approach, the first two dimensions are represented by a simple projection into the two display dimensions. Additional dimensions are depicted by the shape of the face and the individual facial expressions.

Reference-contexts: Chernoff face visualizations do provide an insite into the human user's perception of similarities in that they illustrate the use of a pre-existing mental model, or visual information processing mechanism. Stick figures have been used as another method of symbolic visualization <ref> [11, 18, 12, 10] </ref>. Stick figures represent dimensions by the angle and length of the various limbs of each figure. The figures are then mapped into the display dimensions similar to the positioning of the Chernoff faces.

Reference-contexts: Keahey and Robertson [16, 17] suggest that the use of non-linear magnification techniques can alleviate the crowdedness and the occlusion problem. Visualizing three or more dimensions can be accomplished through the use of geometric and symbolic techniques. An example of a geometric visualization technique is parallel coordinate visualization <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. This technique utilizes uniformly spaced parallel lines oriented perpendicular to either the x-axis or y-axis. Each of the parallel lines represents a specific attribute to be displayed, with attribute values typically ordered in ascending sequence along the line.

Reference-contexts: To represent a tuple in this approach, identify each value of the tuples on the corresponding attribute and construct a polyline between these points. This technique also suffers from the occlusion problem. Keim <ref> [18] </ref> points out that as the number of tuples being displayed is increased, the display becomes illegible. In particular, clusters which appear at low sample rates become totally obscured as the sample rate is increased. <p> Chernoff face visualizations do provide an insite into the human user's perception of similarities in that they illustrate the use of a pre-existing mental model, or visual information processing mechanism.

Intuitively, points with similar colors have similar attribute values for a given dimension.

Reference-contexts: The VDBX System takes a significantly different approach to this problem. The VDBX architecture maps higher dimensional queries (in terms of distinct variables) back to the 2D plane. One approach we utilize is based on the concept of Dimensional Stacking <ref> [21] </ref>. Using this technique, certain variables are designated as "faster moving" than others. That is, along a particular axis that more than variable has been selected, one variable may stay constant for a fixed period while a faster moving variable is changing.

Reference-contexts: The Visual Database Exploration system we have developed employs scat-terplots. One problem with the use of scatterplots is their tendency to appear too crowded.

Another approach to dealing with the crowdedness problem is to use larger symbols to signify the existence of more instances at a given point [5]. This approach, however, introduces an occlusion problem, with larger points occupying more display real estate and the subsequent obscuring of closer, smaller points.
