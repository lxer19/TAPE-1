Title: HOW TO LEARN AN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT I: THE RECTILINEAR CASE  
Author: Xiaotie Deng Tiko Kameda and Christos Papadimitriou

Abstract: We consider the problem faced by a robot that must explore and learn an unknown room with obstacles in it. We seek algorithms that achieve a bounded ratio of the worst-case distance traversed in order to see all visible points of the environment (thus creating a map), divided by the optimum distance needed to verify the map, if we had it in the beginning. The situation is complicated by the fact that the latter off-line problem (the problem of optimally verifying a map) is NP-hard. Although we show that there is no such "competitive" algorithm for general obstacle courses, we give a competitive algorithm for the case of a polygonal room with a bounded number of obstacles in it. We restrict ourselves to the rectilinear case, where each side of the obstacles and the room is parallel to one of the coordinates, and the robot must also move either parallel or perpendicular to the sides. (In a subsequent paper, we will discuss the extension to polygons of general shapes.) We also discuss the off-line problem for simple rectilinear polygons and find an optimal solution (in the L 1 metric) in polynomial time, in the case where the entry and the exit are different points.
