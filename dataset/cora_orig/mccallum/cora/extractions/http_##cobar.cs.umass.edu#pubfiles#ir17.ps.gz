Reference-contexts: There are, however, many representation techniques that capture at least some aspects of meaning in text. The artificial intelligence (AI) community, particularly that portion interested in natural language understanding, has developed a number of techniques for representing the meaning of a text <ref> [All87] </ref>. The most successful representations make fairly specific assumptions about the way in which the text should be interpreted (e.g., as a story about one of a small number of topics) and about the kinds of questions that might be asked about the text (e.g., questions about actor's intentions).

Reference-contexts: A number of other weightings are possible. For example, we can choose weights so that Q is true when any m parents are true to implement an "m-of-n" operator <ref> [Ang75] </ref>, or we can choose weights so that the first parent observed has the most influence on our belief in Q and the second and third parents have less influence on our belief (essentially, the or -combination is an extreme case in which only the first parent influences our belief).

Reference-contexts: An essay by Cheeseman [Che88] and the follow up discussion in a special issue of Computational Intelligence provides a good summary of the issues. Two main probabilistic approaches are in use. The first uses conventional probabilistic methods <ref> [Pea88, LS88, AOJJ89] </ref> and the second uses the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [Dem68, Sha76, Sha87a, Zad86b]. The two approaches are similar; the Dempster-Shafer approach represents an attempt to generalize Bayesian methods in order to cope with the fact that a complete probability distribution is rarely available. <p> Pearl [Pea88] compares Dempster-Shafer with Bayesian inference networks and describes conditions under which they are equivalent. Gordon and Shortliffe [GS84] compare Dempster-Shafer with MYCIN's certainty factors. Lowrance and Garvey [GLF81, LGS86] describe the use of Dempster-Shafer for evidential reasoning. Spiegelhalter and Knill-Jones [SKJ84] and Andersen et al <ref> [AOJJ89] </ref> describe the use of Bayesian methods in clinical applications. Other probabilistic approaches have been developed but have not been as widely accepted. Nilsson's probabilistic logic [Nil84, Nil86] represents an alternative method 28 of dealing with incomplete probability models by estimating bounds for probabilities rather than point estimates.

Reference-contexts: The issue of scalability has not received much attention in the information retrieval literature 19 and we make use of traditional techniques for evaluating computational complexity (see <ref> [Baa88] </ref> for a review). The most common measures of retrieval effectiveness are precision and recall . Precision is the proportion of a retrieved set of documents that is relevant to a query.

Reference-contexts: We then consider how the probabilities required by the model can be estimated (Section 6.4) and show that the estimation problems are essentially equivalent to those encountered with probabilistic or vector-space retrieval. 6.1 Probabilistic retrieval models Conventional probabilistic models <ref> [van79, BC87, SM83] </ref> rank documents by the probability that each document in the collection would be judged relevant to a given query, P (relevantjd i ). 1 This is, in many ways, similar to computing the probability 1 Most probabilistic models do not actually compute P (relevantjd i ), but simply

Reference-contexts: Queries can be optimized in many ways (e.g., take small lists first, keep scores in a hash table [Dos82], or stop when new terms can no longer change the ranking <ref> [BL85] </ref>) but as the number of terms increases, so does the number of documents. Conventional Boolean queries can be optimized to order and and and not evaluations to minimize the number of documents which must be considered.

Reference-contexts: Quinlan's INFERNO [Qui83] incorporates these kinds of probability bounds. The same three inference approaches (symbolic, fuzzy set, probabilistic) are evident in information retrieval research.

Retrieval models based on fuzzy sets have been proposed [Boo85, Rad79, KB84, Zad86a] and a wide variety of probabilistic models have been explored [MK60, RS76, CM78, van79, Fuh89a] which exploit the statistical properties of text in an attempt to improve performance.

Reference-contexts: If we count both new and modified postings, citations affect belief values for 71.2% of all postings. Previous work with citations suggests that they represent a good source of evidence about document content <ref> [SFV83, BM85, PW89] </ref>, but most of this research assumes that we start with a set of documents that are known to be relevant and use citations to find and rank additional documents. Previous work offers little guidance about the relative importance of terms in cited documents.

Reference-contexts: While a general solution to this best-subset problem is intractable, in some cases good heuristic approximations are possible. Best-subset rankings have been considered in IR <ref> [Sti75, Boo89] </ref>, and similar problems arise in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, and truth-maintenance systems. See [Pea88] for a discussion of the best-subset or belief revision problem in Bayesian networks. At present, we consider only documents in isolation since the approach is computationally simpler.

Reference-contexts: These term weights have been studied extensively in information retrieval (see [SB77, van79, SB87, SM83] for reviews) and a number of theoretical models have been developed to motivate the assignment and interpretation of these weights <ref> [CM78, RS76, BS75, SYY75] </ref>. In general, effective term weighting strategies have two components. The first is an estimate of how well a term can discriminate documents in the collection.

Reference-contexts: Since it would be straightforward to add weights to terms in Boolean queries, a open research issue is whether significant improvements can be obtained by weighting Boolean query terms. While the Boolean queries available with the standard test collections do not include term importance information, <ref> [CD90] </ref> suggests that useful information about term importance can be readily obtained from users; this information could be directly incorporated as weights for Boolean expression evaluation.

Reference-contexts: The second approach uses fuzzy set theory [Zad83, Zad86a]. The third approach is based on probabilistic methods. While the use of probabilistic methods is gaining acceptance, the appropriateness of these techniques has been hotly debated. An essay by Cheeseman <ref> [Che88] </ref> and the follow up discussion in a special issue of Computational Intelligence provides a good summary of the issues.

Reference-contexts: In this view, information retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process in which we estimate the probability that a user's information need, expressed as one or more queries, is met given a document 10 as "evidence." Network representations show promise as mechanisms for inferring these kinds of relationships <ref> [CT89, CK87] </ref>. The idea that retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process is not new. Cooper's logical relevance [Coo71] is based on deductive relationships between representations of documents and information needs. <p> Network representations have been used in information retrieval since at least the early 1960's. Networks have been used to support diverse retrieval functions, including browsing [TC89], document clustering [Cro80], spreading activation search <ref> [CK87] </ref>, support for multiple search strategies [CT87], and representation of user knowledge [OPC86] or document content [TS85]. In the research described here we adapt an inference network model to the retrieval task. The use of the model is intended to: * Support the use of multiple document representation schemes. <p> Jones and Furnas [JF87] present a representative spreading activation model which is compared to conventional retrieval models by Salton [SB88].

Reference-contexts: Van Rijsbergen [van86, van89] discusses the nature of inference in information retrieval and has proposed the use of non-classical logics for determining the degree to which a document implies or matches a query. Croft <ref> [Cro87, CLCW89] </ref> has developed the notion of plausible inference in information retrieval and suggested that multiple sources of evidence should be combined to infer the probability that a document matches a query. <p> Halting conditions and weighting functions vary, but the pattern of activation is used to rank documents for presentation to the user.

A third formulation which generalizes these two models was proposed by Robertson, Maron, and Cooper [RMC82].

Reference-contexts: The development of more 27 formal techniques has led to heated debate among several competing schools. We will not review the debate in detail (see [KL86, LK88, SP90] for surveys), but three main approaches have emerged. The first approach relies on symbolic reasoning <ref> [Coh85, Fox86, Doy79] </ref> in which degrees of certainty are encoded using a discrete set of values (certain, somewhat certain, : : : ) that are then used with a deductive reasoning system. The second approach uses fuzzy set theory [Zad83, Zad86a]. The third approach is based on probabilistic methods.

Reference-contexts: The idea that retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process is not new. Cooper's logical relevance <ref> [Coo71] </ref> is based on deductive relationships between representations of documents and information needs. Wilson's situational relevance [Wil73] extends this notion to incorporate inductive or uncertain inference based on the degree to which documents support information needs.

Reference-contexts: Croft and Thompson use browsing in a more complex network as one search strategy in I 3 R [CT87]. 31 Browsing is an important technique for accessing text in hypertext networks.

Spreading activation is a search technique in which a network representation of a document collection is used to retrieve documents that are "similar" to a query.

Reference-contexts: a result, the network model provides a natural framework within which to integrate results from several areas of information retrieval research (e.g., intelligent interfaces or NLP techniques). 164 C h a p t e r 9 Implementation Since the evaluation of Bayesian inference networks is known to be NP -complete <ref> [Coo90b] </ref>, it was clear from the outset that simplifying assumptions would have to be made in order to use these techniques for anything beyond toy examples.

Reference-contexts: The vector-space model has been criticized as an ad hoc model since there is relatively little theoretical justification for many of its variations. Some forms of the vector-space model can be shown to produce rankings that are equivalent to those produced by probabilistic models <ref> [Cro84] </ref>. Probabilistic retrieval. Probabilistic retrieval is based on the Probability Ranking Principal which asserts that the best overall retrieval effectiveness will be achieved when documents are ranked in decreasing order of probability of relevance.

Reference-contexts: Computing a or not b, then, has nearly the same cost as computing a or b. 6.3.2 Relaxing the interpretation of Boolean operators The binary nature of the retrieval decision in Boolean systems is frequently cited as a drawback <ref> [Cro86, SM83, Sal88, LB88] </ref>. Intuitively, we would like a document containing all but one term of an n-term and to be judged nearly as likely to match the query as a document containing all n terms and substantially more likely to match than a document containing none of the terms. <p> A document containing the phrase will also contain all three terms, but this dependence is not represented in the document network. A query which contains the phrase is linked to p l and optionally to the component terms. Figure 7.5a is similar to the phrase model developed by Croft <ref> [Cro86] </ref> in which the presence of a set of dependent terms (a phrase) results in an additive correction to the independence model ranking function.

Reference-contexts: The main difference between the models is that probabilistic models generally have a much more rigorous theoretical base. 1.3 Inference network model Recent retrieval research has suggested that significant improvements in retrieval performance will require techniques that, in some sense, "understand" the content of documents and queries <ref> [van86, Cro87] </ref> and can be used to infer probable relationships between documents and queries. <p> A description of an information need can be used to generate several query representations (e.g., probabilistic, Boolean), each using a different query strategy and each capturing different aspects of the information need. These different search strategies are known to retrieve different documents for the same underlying information need <ref> [Cro87] </ref>. * Facilitate flexible matching between the terms or concepts mentioned in queries and those assigned to documents. The poor match between the vocabulary used to express queries and the vocabulary used to represent documents appears to be a major cause of poor recall [FLGD87]. <p> Van Rijsbergen [van86, van89] discusses the nature of inference in information retrieval and has proposed the use of non-classical logics for determining the degree to which a document implies or matches a query. Croft <ref> [Cro87, CLCW89] </ref> has developed the notion of plausible inference in information retrieval and suggested that multiple sources of evidence should be combined to infer the probability that a document matches a query.

Reference-contexts: Connectionist approaches. Connectionist approaches are similar to spreading activation. They differ in that the connectionist links do not have a clear semantic interpretation (they simply characterize the "association" between network nodes) and the weights associated with links are learned from training samples or user guidance. Croft and Thompson <ref> [CT84] </ref> use a connectionist network in an attempt to learn to select a query strategy. Brachman and McGuiness [BM88] use a connectionist approach to retrieve facts from a knowledge base on programming languages. Other connectionist approaches to information retrieval are described by Belew [Bel89] and Kwok [Kwo89]. <p> Boolean belief values depend heavily on the structure of the Boolean expression. In practice, and -structured queries generally rank a relatively small number of documents highly after which belief values drop off rapidly. Or - structured queries tend to produce a more uniform distribution of beliefs. Croft and Thompson <ref> [CT84] </ref> found that different query representations or strategies worked better for some queries than others and that it was difficult to predict which strategy would work best with a given query.

Reference-contexts: Network representations have been used in information retrieval since at least the early 1960's. Networks have been used to support diverse retrieval functions, including browsing [TC89], document clustering [Cro80], spreading activation search [CK87], support for multiple search strategies <ref> [CT87] </ref>, and representation of user knowledge [OPC86] or document content [TS85]. In the research described here we adapt an inference network model to the retrieval task. The use of the model is intended to: * Support the use of multiple document representation schemes. <p> One of the objectives of the RUBRIC design was to allow comparison of different uncertainty calculi [TAAC86] and RUBRIC has recently been reformulated to use inference networks [FCAT90]. Rule-based inference using network structures has been used with thesaurus information to improve the match between document and query vocabularies <ref> [CT87, Sho85] </ref>. Semantic networks have also been used to represent thesaurus-like information [SSG89, MC87]. Structure matching. Structure matching forms the basis of most retrieval techniques based on semantic networks. <p> Browsing is common in thesaurus systems. Oddy's THOMAS system [Odd77] uses browsing in a simple network of documents and terms to build a model of the user's information need. Croft and Thompson use browsing in a more complex network as one search strategy in I 3 R <ref> [CT87] </ref>. 31 Browsing is an important technique for accessing text in hypertext networks. Croft and Turtle [CT89] and Frisse and Cousins [FC89] describe retrieval models for hypertext networks. Coombs [Coo90a] reviews hypertext retrieval research and describes an operational system. Spreading activation.

Reference-contexts: In this view, information retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process in which we estimate the probability that a user's information need, expressed as one or more queries, is met given a document 10 as "evidence." Network representations show promise as mechanisms for inferring these kinds of relationships <ref> [CT89, CK87] </ref>. The idea that retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process is not new. Cooper's logical relevance [Coo71] is based on deductive relationships between representations of documents and information needs. <p> Croft and Thompson use browsing in a more complex network as one search strategy in I 3 R [CT87]. 31 Browsing is an important technique for accessing text in hypertext networks. Croft and Turtle <ref> [CT89] </ref> and Frisse and Cousins [FC89] describe retrieval models for hypertext networks. Coombs [Coo90a] reviews hypertext retrieval research and describes an operational system. Spreading activation. <p> It is also possible that nearest neighbor information would improve performance if added after the initial ranking, but only to highly ranked documents. Our results are similar to those of Croft, et al <ref> [CT89] </ref> who used citations and nearest neighbor links in a spreading activation network. They also found that citations represented stronger evidence than nearest neighbor links for the CACM collection.

Reference-contexts: While these inference networks were developed for use in expert systems, they are very similar to the influence diagrams [Sha86] of operations research and to techniques developed for pedigree analysis <ref> [CTS78] </ref>, legal reasoning [SM82], and intelligence analysis [Sch87]. 3.2 Network models in information retrieval Graph and network structures have been widely used in information retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Despite these limitations, test collections remain the most widely used method for comparing retrieval performance. New test collections are currently under development that will address the size and material type limitations <ref> [DAR90] </ref>. 2.1.2 Statistical tests Most data gathered during retrieval experiments does not lend itself well to standard statistical tests both because the quantities we wish to measure are difficult to define and because the measurements we collect do not exhibit the properties that we have come to expect in data associated

Reference-contexts: An essay by Cheeseman [Che88] and the follow up discussion in a special issue of Computational Intelligence provides a good summary of the issues. Two main probabilistic approaches are in use. The first uses conventional probabilistic methods [Pea88, LS88, AOJJ89] and the second uses the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence <ref> [Dem68, Sha76, Sha87a, Zad86b] </ref>. The two approaches are similar; the Dempster-Shafer approach represents an attempt to generalize Bayesian methods in order to cope with the fact that a complete probability distribution is rarely available.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest are inference techniques that deal with uncertain information or evidence and with inference based on this evidence.

Reference-contexts: Queries can be optimized in many ways (e.g., take small lists first, keep scores in a hash table <ref> [Dos82] </ref>, or stop when new terms can no longer change the ranking [BL85]) but as the number of terms increases, so does the number of documents. Conventional Boolean queries can be optimized to order and and and not evaluations to minimize the number of documents which must be considered.

Reference-contexts: The development of more 27 formal techniques has led to heated debate among several competing schools. We will not review the debate in detail (see [KL86, LK88, SP90] for surveys), but three main approaches have emerged. The first approach relies on symbolic reasoning <ref> [Coh85, Fox86, Doy79] </ref> in which degrees of certainty are encoded using a discrete set of values (certain, somewhat certain, : : : ) that are then used with a deductive reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: Several weighting schemes have been proposed in which the belief in a repre sentation concept depends on the frequency with which the concept occurs in a document and on the frequency of the concept in the collection (see, for example, <ref> [EW61] </ref>). We will assume that belief in a representation concept is proportional to the within-document frequency (tf ) and inversely proportional to the frequency of the concept in the collection.

Reference-contexts: Some work on estimating weights for phrases rather than single terms has been done <ref> [Fag87, LC90] </ref>, but our understanding of how phrases can be used to improve retrieval performance is still limited.

Reference-contexts: In some retrieval models (e.g., document space modification <ref> [YM88, FB90] </ref>) queries are used in an attempt to learn better document representations, which gives rise to an indirect causal relationship between queries and representation concepts that is not represented in the inference network. <p> Robertson, Maron, and Cooper are clearly concerned with this problem and suggest some subjectivist techniques for estimating the probabilities (e.g., using thesaurus information).

Reference-contexts: The poor match between the vocabulary used to express queries and the vocabulary used to represent documents appears to be a major cause of poor recall <ref> [FLGD87] </ref>. Recall can be improved using domain knowledge to match query and representation concepts without significantly degrading precision. The resulting formal retrieval model integrates several previous models in a single theoretical framework. The network model can be used to simulate probabilistic, Boolean, and cluster-based models. <p> Research suggests, however, that the mismatch between query and indexing vocabularies may be a major cause of poor recall <ref> [FLGD87, Tur90] </ref>. While our current implementation assumes a one-to-one correspondence between query and representation concepts, it would appear that improved estimates of the dependence of query concepts on representation concepts could markedly improve performance.

Reference-contexts: Adding CR categories as a separate Boolean query significantly degrades performance. Since the CR categories were assigned to queries by a domain expert, these results are not encouraging. Since earlier work by Fox <ref> [Fox83b] </ref> suggested that CR categories could improve performance when treated as relatively weak evidence when compared to the natural language query, we ran a series of experiments in which the CR categories were added as a separate query with reduced weight.

Reference-contexts: Symbolic approaches include those based on Boolean logic and on relational algebra [Bla88] or calculus.

Reference-contexts: The techniques required to support these kinds of inference are similar to those used in expert systems that must reason with uncertain information. A number of competing inference models have been developed for these kinds of expert systems <ref> [KL86, LK88] </ref> and several of these models can be adapted to the document retrieval task.

The development of more 27 formal techniques has led to heated debate among several competing schools. We will not review the debate in detail (see <ref> [KL86, LK88, SP90] </ref> for surveys), but three main approaches have emerged. The first approach relies on symbolic reasoning [Coh85, Fox86, Doy79] in which degrees of certainty are encoded using a discrete set of values (certain, somewhat certain, : : : ) that are then used with a deductive reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: Several studies have found that searches using natural language terms retrieve different documents for the same information need [Hur82, PF85, GWDS86]. In a recent study comparing the performance of term- and citation-based searches, Pao and Worthen <ref> [PW89] </ref> found that citation 1 It is sometimes useful to distinguish between a list of citations and a bibliography which may include related but uncited documents. <p> If we count both new and modified postings, citations affect belief values for 71.2% of all postings.

Previous work offers little guidance about the relative importance of terms in cited documents.

Reference-contexts: As will be discussed in Chapter 9, this simplification is an important factor in reducing the exponential complexity of network evaluation. Note that any retrieval model that produces document rankings that are consistent with conventional formulations of the Probability Ranking Principle <ref> [Rob77] </ref> must also consider documents in isolation. The document network is built once for a given collection. Given one or more queries, we then build a query network that attempts to characterize the dependence of the information need on the collection.

Reference-contexts: during retrieval experiments does not lend itself well to standard statistical tests both because the quantities we wish to measure are difficult to define and because the measurements we collect do not exhibit the properties that we have come to expect in data associated with physical systems (e.g., normally distributed). <ref> [Rob81] </ref> reviews many of the definitional problems that affect experiment design.

Reference-contexts: Some work has been done to adapt the natural language understanding techniques to an information retrieval setting, but there is little near-term hope that these techniques could be used to represent large document collections and arbitrary queries <ref> [Sal86] </ref>. Within the information retrieval community, a number of techniques have been developed that can represent the content of documents and information needs. These representations have a much different flavor than NLP representations.

Reference-contexts: Computing a or not b, then, has nearly the same cost as computing a or b. 6.3.2 Relaxing the interpretation of Boolean operators The binary nature of the retrieval decision in Boolean systems is frequently cited as a drawback <ref> [Cro86, SM83, Sal88, LB88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The final difference between the two models lies in a philosophical difference regarding the nature of probability estimates; the unified model is frequentist while the inference network model takes a modified subjectivist view (see <ref> [Sav54] </ref> for a discussion of the history and nature of frequentist versus subjectivist interpretations). The structure of the unified model is influenced by the desire to estimate the required probabilities based on observed frequencies.

Citations. <p> 8.2.2 Dependence of term belief on documents The probability that a term accurately describes the content of a document can be estimated in several ways, but previous information retrieval research has consistently shown within-document frequency (tf ) and inverse document frequency (idf ) to be useful components of such estimates <ref> [SB87] </ref>. In developing estimates we concentrated on functions involving tf and idf ; other functions are certainly possible and could be used in the basic model.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest are inference techniques that deal with uncertain information or evidence and with inference based on this evidence. Early approaches tended to be ad hoc (e.g., MYCIN's certainty factors <ref> [Sho76] </ref> or PROSPECTOR's use of probability [DHN76, DHB + 78]). The development of more 27 formal techniques has led to heated debate among several competing schools. We will not review the debate in detail (see [KL86, LK88, SP90] for surveys), but three main approaches have emerged.

Salton and McGill <ref> [SM83] </ref> and van Rijsbergen [van79] provide more current introductions to common retrieval structures, many of which are graph or network based.

Reference-contexts: Early approaches tended to be ad hoc (e.g., MYCIN's certainty factors [Sho76] or PROSPECTOR's use of probability [DHN76, DHB + 78]). The development of more 27 formal techniques has led to heated debate among several competing schools. We will not review the debate in detail (see <ref> [KL86, LK88, SP90] </ref> for surveys), but three main approaches have emerged. The first approach relies on symbolic reasoning [Coh85, Fox86, Doy79] in which degrees of certainty are encoded using a discrete set of values (certain, somewhat certain, : : : ) that are then used with a deductive reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: The February 1987 issue of Statistical Science includes a debate between proponents of the two approaches [Sha87b, Lin87, Spi87].

Reference-contexts: The two approaches are similar; the Dempster-Shafer approach represents an attempt to generalize Bayesian methods in order to cope with the fact that a complete probability distribution is rarely available.

Reference-contexts: Rule-based inference using network structures has been used with thesaurus information to improve the match between document and query vocabularies [CT87, Sho85]. Semantic networks have also been used to represent thesaurus-like information <ref> [SSG89, MC87] </ref>. Structure matching. Structure matching forms the basis of most retrieval techniques based on semantic networks. Early work by Salton [Sal68] describes the use of graphs to represent the syntactic structure of text and graph matching to identify similar text content. <p> We also deal only with the use of this information for simple automated inference about document and query content. We do not deal with frame-structured thesauri that attempt to capture the detailed structure of domain knowledge <ref> [SSG89] </ref> or with the use of a thesaurus to aid to the user during query formulation [Pol87]. Synonyms can be represented in the network by creating a node to represent an equivalence class and adding it as a child to each synonym in the equivalence class.

Reference-contexts: Building these equivalence classes into the document network is probably not useful for two reasons. First, their presence could represent a significant computational burden. This is especially true since the number of potential equivalence classes is very large, but only a few will be useful for a given query <ref> [ST84] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While a general solution to this best-subset problem is intractable, in some cases good heuristic approximations are possible. Best-subset rankings have been considered in IR <ref> [Sti75, Boo89] </ref>, and similar problems arise in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, and truth-maintenance systems. See [Pea88] for a discussion of the best-subset or belief revision problem in Bayesian networks. At present, we consider only documents in isolation since the approach is computationally simpler.

Reference-contexts: Tables showing precision at standard recall points will be used extensively in Chapter 8. Several other measures of retrieval effectiveness have been developed but are not widely used. 2.1.1 Test collections In order to compare the effectiveness of two retrieval models we make use of standard test collections <ref> [Sv76] </ref>. A test collection consists of: * A set of documents current test collections generally contain information from the original document, such as title, author, date, and an abstract. The collection may include additional information such as controlled vocabulary terms, author-assigned descriptors, and citation information.

Reference-contexts: Similar relevance feedback strategies (e.g., negative feedback or fixed-increment correction [van79]) can be simulated using the same basic feedback model. 7.1.2 Boolean feedback A number of models have been proposed for using relevance feedback with Boolean retrieval systems <ref> [Sal88, SVF84, Rad88, Rad83] </ref>. While some of these models have been shown to significantly improve performance when compared to conventional Boolean retrieval, they are not attractive in the network environment.

Reference-contexts: These term weights have been studied extensively in information retrieval (see [SB77, van79, SB87, SM83] for reviews) and a number of theoretical models have been developed to motivate the assignment and interpretation of these weights <ref> [CM78, RS76, BS75, SYY75] </ref>. In general, effective term weighting strategies have two components. The first is an estimate of how well a term can discriminate documents in the collection.

For both types of evidence, we used data developed for spreading activation experiments with I 3 R <ref> [TC89] </ref>. Essentially, we treat the existence of a citation or nearest neighbor link as evidence that the cited or clustered document has content that is similar to the original. In Figure 8.1 document d 1 has been instantiated.

Reference-contexts: Research suggests, however, that the mismatch between query and indexing vocabularies may be a major cause of poor recall <ref> [FLGD87, Tur90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The idea that retrieval is an inference or evidential reasoning process is not new. Cooper's logical relevance [Coo71] is based on deductive relationships between representations of documents and information needs. Wilson's situational relevance <ref> [Wil73] </ref> extends this notion to incorporate inductive or uncertain inference based on the degree to which documents support information needs. The techniques required to support these kinds of inference are similar to those used in expert systems that must reason with uncertain information.

Reference-contexts: In some retrieval models (e.g., document space modification <ref> [YM88, FB90] </ref>) queries are used in an attempt to learn better document representations, which gives rise to an indirect causal relationship between queries and representation concepts that is not represented in the inference network. <p> Altering dependencies is appropriate when the initial network is known to be an approximation to the correct distribution and we obtain better information about the nature of the true distribution. This approach is used in document space modification <ref> [YM88, FB90] </ref> where we use a set of queries and relevance judgements to learn the "correct" distribution for documents and representation concepts. This approach can also be used in the query network which changes as we gain information about the user's information need.
