Abstract: This paper describes the wearable Remembrance Agent, a continuously running proactive memory aid that uses the physical context of a wearable computer to provide notes that might be relevant in that context. A currently running prototype is described, along with future directions for research inspired by using the prototype.

Reference-contexts: Several systems also exist to provide contextual cues for managing information on a traditional desktop system. For example, the Lifestreams project provides a complete file management system based on time-stamp <ref> [Freeman and Gelernter, 1996] </ref>. It also provides the ability to tag future events, such as meeting times, that trigger alarms shortly before they occur.

Reference-contexts: The secondary-task nature, proactivity, and sensors of wearables make them a natural match for software agent technology. Software agents are programs that continuously run in the background, sensing their environment and occasionally proactively acting on behalf of their user <ref> [Maes, 1994] </ref>. Augmented memory is an especially good application for agent technology and wearables, since everyone needs help remembering, especially when away from their normal calendars and desktop computers. 3 Remembrance Agents The portability of the palm-top computer has driven their primary use as day-planners, address books, and note-taking devices.

Reference-contexts: To retrieve the whole text described in a summary line, the wearer hits a quick chord on a chording keyboard. 3.1 The Desktop RA An earlier desktop version of the RA is described in <ref> [Rhodes and Starner, 1996] </ref>. The desktop version runs in the background and watches whatever is typed or read in a word-processor.

Reference-contexts: The method used is identical to the tfc nfx TFiDF method used by Salton <ref> [Salton, 1988] </ref>, with the addition of a normalized query vector to keep the final relevance score between zero and one.

Reference-contexts: The current design shows an entire 80 column by 25 row screen, but this often produces too much text for a wearer to scan while still trying to carry on a conversation. Future versions will experiment with variable font size and animated typography <ref> [Small et al., 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The physical sensors on the wearable include a "locust" infra-red receiver that communicates with location-beacons placed around the Media Lab <ref> [Starner et al., 1997a] </ref>. The computer's internal clock is used to determine date, time, and day of the week.

Reference-contexts: of a meeting, and the RA brings up pointers to that entry to remind her that she should be on her way. 4 User Interface 4.1 Hardware The wearable RA is currently running under Linux on a wearable 100MHz 486 based on the "Tin Lizzy" design developed by Thad Starner <ref> [Starner et al., 1995] </ref>. The input device is a one-handed chording keyboard called the Twiddler (made by Handykey), with which one can reach typing speeds of 30-50+ words per minute on a full-function key-board.

Reference-contexts: For example, a wearer of the system should not have to type in the name of every person met at a conference. Instead, the wearable should automatically know who is being spoken to, through active badge systems or eventually through automatic face-recognition <ref> [Starner et al., 1997b] </ref>. Similarly, the wearable should know its own physical location through GPS or an indoor location sensor. The Wearable Remembrance Agent system uses this physical context in finding information relevant to a wearer's situation. Context information is used in two different ways. <p> Others in the wear-ables group at the Media Lab have experimented with eyeglass-mounts that provide an overlay effect of text or graphics on the real world <ref> [Starner et al., 1997b] </ref>. The physical sensors on the wearable include a "locust" infra-red receiver that communicates with location-beacons placed around the Media Lab [Starner et al., 1997a]. The computer's internal clock is used to determine date, time, and day of the week.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, the context of a remembered episode provides lots of cues for recall later. These cues include the physical location of an event, who was there, what was happening at the same time, and what happened immediately before and after <ref> [Tulving, 1983] </ref>. This information both helps us recall events given a partial context, and to associate our current environment with past experiences that might be related. Until recently, computers have only had access to a user's current context within a computational task, but not outside of that environment.
