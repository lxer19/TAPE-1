Abstract: We chose the seating arrangements to encourage head turning: because of the 60 degree horizontal field of view of the HMD, a guest had to turn his head to see his two friends to the left and right (see Figure 4). If all four guests did not know each other, we made sure that two friends sat next to, rather than across from, each other; in most cases this happened naturally. We found that where characters look in the virtual world directs attention. We updated the avatars' head position in the virtual world to match where the guests were looking: this led some guests to turn their heads to look where the other avatars were looking. The dragon was particularly effective in this respect: guests would turn their heads to look at the guest the dragon was breathing fire at. We encouraged this by charring that avatars face. Because guests identified the avatars with their friends, they talked to each other during this experience. We also tried to encourage talking by applying the principle that guests care about their self image: pointing the ashlight at another avatar and pushing the button caused that avatar's head to turn into something humorous, like a snowmans head. When guests realized this, they would often tell a friend what his head looked like, and ask about their own heads appearance. One load issue we did not address was the time required for guests to physically don the HMD; Disney solved this problem for the Aladdin project by having the guests put on an inner liner for the HMD in the queueing area. The HMD then quickly snapped in place over the liner. The transition from the virtual to the real world clearly communicated that the virtual experience was over. Because the quality of the camera's output in the HMD was worse than looking at the world unimpeded, guests had an incentive to remove the HMD. As soon as the strobe light stopped the vast majority of guests immediately removed the HMD. Prior to this project, we experimented with other methods of communicating that the experience was over, and discovered that most guests will sit and watch anything dynamic in an HMD, even if head tracking is turned off. One exception is scrolling credits [1]. donned an HMD and ew a magic carpet around Agrabah collecting pieces of the genies lamp. This project was a first step toward telling interactive stories using virtual reality, and raised many of the difficult issues in creating a successful virtual experience. Based on informal observation of and feedback from the more than 1,500 SIGGRAPH attendees who experienced the Mad Hatters Tea Party, we believe we were successful in presenting an entertaining and enjoyable show. The success of our show required overcoming 5 key problems: 1. Entering a virtual world is a jarring experience. We used Alice in Wonderland for our back story, showed the guests the exact imagery they would see in the HMD while they were waiting in the queue line, and created a smooth transition from the real to the virtual world using strobe lights and see-through HMDs that helped ground the user in the virtual world. 2. Guests dont turn their heads. We used see-through HMDs, virtual characters, and careful layout of the real and virtual spaces. 3. Wearing an HMD is an isolating experience. We made it easy for guests to identify the avatars with their friends, and utilized the fact that people care about their self image. 4. Guests have difficulty picking up equipment while wearing the HMD. We used see-through HMDs so guests could see the equipment. 5. Guests arent sure when the experience ends. We used a transition sequence that clearly communicated when the experience was over.
