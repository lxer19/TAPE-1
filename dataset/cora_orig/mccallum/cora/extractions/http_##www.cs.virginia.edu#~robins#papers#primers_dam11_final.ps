Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of primer selection in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. We prove that the problem of minimizing the number of primers required to amplify a set of DNA sequences is N P-complete. Moreover, we show that it is also intractable to approximate solutions to this problem to within a constant times optimal. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the primers minimization problem within reasonable time for typical instances. Next, we present an efficient approximation scheme for this problem, and prove that our heuristic always produces solutions with cost no worse than a logarithmic factor times optimal. Finally, we analyze a weighted variant, where both the number of primers as well as the sum of their costs is optimized simultaneously. We conclude by addressing the empirical performance of our methods on biological data.

Reference-contexts: PCR has been used to synthesize nanogram quantities of a gene from a single sperm (and thus a single DNA molecule), a 10 14 -fold amplification <ref> [1] </ref>. Computer programs [7] [10] [11] are used extensively to design PCR primers (i.e., short stretches of DNA, 15 to 20 nucleotides long, that are used to establish the ends of the PCR reaction). <p> If we set t = 0, this cost function will consider only cardinality, while setting t = 1 will make the cost function consider weight only. As t varies in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a reasonably smooth tradeoff will be observed in practice, as we show in the next section. 7 Experimental Results We implemented the exact algorithm and the approximation algorithms discussed above using the C programming language in the UNIX environment (code is available from the authors upon request). <p> We implemented a greedy heuristic with objective function W 0 (u i ; M i ) = t fl W (u i ; M i ) + (1 t) fl K mentioned in Section 6 for various values of t in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The results are presented in Figure 6. Each data point represents the average values over the 30 runs on the random data for selected values of t.

This extends the unweighted approximation algorithm to a weighted approximation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the practice of molecular biology, making it routine to synthesize millions of copies of a single gene or other portion of a genome <ref> [5] </ref>. PCR has been used to synthesize nanogram quantities of a gene from a single sperm (and thus a single DNA molecule), a 10 14 -fold amplification [1].

Reference-contexts: Large families of related genes have become surprisingly common over the past 5 years. One the largest known families contains more than 1000 related genes that encode proteins called G-protein-coupled receptors <ref> [6] </ref>. However, many families encode a large set of related proteins with essential roles; PCR amplification is usually the most effective method for characterizing members of such large gene families. <p> We also implemented the scheme mentioned in Section 6 that simultaneously minimizes both cardinality and weight. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms on biological data consisting of 56 DNA sequences, each 75 nucleotides long, from transmembrane domain three (TM3) from 56 G-protein coupled receptors <ref> [6] </ref>; the data itself is given in Figure 5. As mentioned in Section 1, these primers would determine one end of the amplified sequence. The other end would be determined by a second set of primers from a second set of sequences. <p> The other end would be determined by a second set of primers from a second set of sequences. For the G-protein-coupled receptors, TM7 would provide a natural second target, since it is also highly conserved <ref> [6] </ref>. We also created 30 random permutations of the codons (i.e., 3-base triplet substrings) of each sequence of the data, and tested our method on all of the resulting instances.
