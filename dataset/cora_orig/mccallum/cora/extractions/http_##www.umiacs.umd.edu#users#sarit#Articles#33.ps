Abstract: Autonomous agents working in multi-agent environments may need to cooperate in order to fulfill tasks. Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which they have to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should be attached to a group of agents which will perform the task. The allocation of tasks to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot be performed by a single agent. It may also be useful to assign groups of agents to tasks when the group's performance is more efficient than the performance of single agents. In this paper we give an efficient solution to the problem of task allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest that the agents will form coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve the efficiency. We present a distributed algorithm with a low ratio bound and with a low computational complexity. Our algorithm is an any-time algorithm, it is simple, efficient and easy to implement.

Reference-contexts: This implies a computational complexity which is, in practice, too high. However, a variety of heuristic algorithms for solving this problem have been suggested, e.g., [ Christofides and Korman, 1975; Balas and Padberg, 1975; Chvatal, 1979 ] . Among them we can find the algorithm of Chvatal <ref> [ Chvatal, 1979 ] </ref> , which has a logarithmic ratio bound 9 .

Reference-contexts: allocate sub-groups of agents to the subtasks. 6 This notion of coalitional value is different from the notion of game theory coalitional value, since here the value depends on the coalitional configuration and on the task allocation. 7 This assumption is usually called "group rationality" in the game theory literature <ref> [ Harsanyi, 1977; Rapoport, 1970; Luce and Raiffa, 1957 ] </ref> . each pair of coalitions C 1 ,C 2 in the set, C 1 " C 2 = ;, if C 1 ,C 2 join together, then the newly formed coalition will have a new value V new C V 1

Reference-contexts: The initial coalitional state consists of n, single agents. The agents then begin negotiating <ref> [ Kreifelts and Martial, 1990 ] </ref> and, step by step, form coalitions. Agents that join coalitions quit the coalition-formation process, and only the remaining single agents will continue negotiations. The reduction in the number of agents that continue negotiating reduces the computational and communication costs.

Reference-contexts: For example, suppose that a transportation task of delivering 10,000 flowers from New Jersey to New York City has been ordered. Such a task may be performed 4 Transportation systems have been extensively used as examples for DPS systems (e.g., <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ). We do not intend to solve a specific transportation problem. However, we provide this example because the reader is familiar with it.

Reference-contexts: Rational agents in a super-additive environment will prefer the grand coalition over all other coalitions. A grand coalition is a coalition that includes all of the agents <ref> [ Shapley, 1953 ] </ref> . Hence, in a super-additive environment, when the grand coalition is formed, the only problem that still remains is how the utility should be distributed among its members. This is a serious problem in MAS.

Reference-contexts: Rather, we suggest a solution which is most appropriate for the non-super-additive case. Distributed task allocation has been discussed in the context of DPS systems. A well-known example of such a task allocation mechanism is the Contract Net Protocol (CNP) <ref> [ Smith, 1980 ] </ref> . This work discusses cases in which an agent that attempts to satisfy a task may divide it into several sub-tasks and sub-contract each subtask to another agent via a bidding mechanism.

Reference-contexts: We assume that agents can communicate, negotiate and make agreements <ref> [ Werner, 1988 ] </ref> . Communications require time and effort on the part of the agents. We also assume that some resources can be transferred between agents.
