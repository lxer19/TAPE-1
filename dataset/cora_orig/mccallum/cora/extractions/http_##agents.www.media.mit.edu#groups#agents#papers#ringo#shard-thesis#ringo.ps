Reference-contexts: the scale or our project was much greater, serving 2100 users in less than two months, with 3000 artists and 9000 albums at the time of this writing. 2.1.6 ICSI Personalized Movie Recommendations David Anderson at the International Computer Science Institute also has an Internet service providing personalized movie recommendations <ref> [1] </ref>. His Internet advertisement for the service reads as follows: Do your tastes differ from those of the masses, so that population-averaged movie ratings are of little use in picking movies to see? If so, read on. <p> Note that given the sparse nature of the user-artist matrix, most possible s ij and t ij 's are undefined. In our equations, it is always assumed that we perform operations on those values that exist. We let c ij = <ref> [1; 0] </ref> if s ij [is,is not] defined. Likewise, d ij = [1; 0] if t ij [is,is not] defined. 38 U = fu 1 ; : : : ; u N u g is the set of all N u users. <p> In our equations, it is always assumed that we perform operations on those values that exist.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, Movie Select is a static package, using a data set that does not change over time. Nor does it record any history of a person's past use. 2.1.4 Claire V. Another commercial movie recommendation service is Claire V. offered by Entertainment Decisions, Inc <ref> [2] </ref>. Claire V. is a kiosk installation designed for video rental stores. Customers would use Claire V. on a regular basis, rating movies and receiving recommendations. At this time I have no technical information on the project.

Reference-contexts: For example, NewT uses content information about an article such as keywords in the article's text and the newsgroups in which the article is posted to determine whether to deliver the article. However, Content-based Filtering has limitations <ref> [3] </ref>: * The items must be of some machine parsable form, or attributes must have been assigned to the items by hand. <p> artist and all the scores were in the target set. 4.6 The Mean Squared Difference Algorithm Carl Feynman has proposed a Social Filtering scheme where the degree of dissimilarity between two user profiles, U x and U y is measured by the mean squared difference (MSD) between the two profiles <ref> [3] </ref>. For every artist that the two people have both rated, take the difference in their ratings and square it.

Reference-contexts: current and recent research in the field of information retrieval and information filtering which relate to this work are described below. 19 2.1.1 Tapestry Tapestry is another information filtering system which accepts the ratings or annotations of users for items, in this case electronic documents such as e-mail and Netnews <ref> [4] </ref>. As users read documents, they may attach annotations to documents. The filters that search the annotations for interesting articles however are constructed by the end user, using a query language.

Reference-contexts: At this time I have no technical information on the project. However, their portfolio indicates some form of process which seems to be Social Information Filtering in nature. 21 2.1.5 videos@bellcore.com videos@bellcore.com is a personalized movie recommendation system <ref> [5] </ref>. A user accesses it by e-mail. 2 It too uses social filtering techniques. Unfortunately, at the time no details were available about its inner workings. Its help file describes its operation as follows: After you return your ratings, videos@bellcore.com sends you a list of suggested movie titles.

Reference-contexts: Our problem domain and the algorithms we tested differ, but our approaches are very similar. We discovered some SF schemes which, for our problem domain of music recommendation, perform better than the GroupLens algorithm. 2.1.3 Movie Select Paramount Interactive offers a commercial application called Movie Select <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to being an excellent database about movies, it is designed to recommend 1 collaborative filtering, as they call it. 20 movies to individual users. Its documentation describes its approach as follows: How does it work? Hundreds of moviegoers were interviewed to get their list of favorite movies.

Reference-contexts: Consider these statistics: * An average Blockbuster video store has 6,000 videos to choose from. * The BMG Compact Disc club has over 14,000 titles for sale. * The average USENET site stores over 113,000 articles at any given time <ref> [7] </ref>. * The Library of Congress houses 101,395,257 items, including 15,700,905 books. * Mark Goodson alone has produced over 38,000 game show episodes. 13 People handle this information overload through their own effort, the effort of others and some blind luck.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the social information filtering is left to the user: Tapestry only provides an on-line architecture for facilitating the process "word-of-mouth." 2.1.2 GroupLens A project similar to ours is the GroupLens system <ref> [8] </ref>. GroupLens is a system applying social filtering 1 to the personalized selection of Netnews. It provides an open architecture wherein people can rate articles, and their ratings are distributed through the net to other user's agents through a specialized newsgroup which only carries article ratings. <p> squared difference, provided no significant changes in our results. * Of course, changing the threshold parameter L, as discussed above. 44 common. 4.7 The Pearson r Algorithm The GroupLens project, described in Chapter 2, proposes the use of a standard Pearson r correlation coefficient to measure similarity between user profiles <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A 7-point scale was selected since, according to one source, the reliability of data collected in surveys does not increase substantially if the number of points is increased beyond 7 <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Much research in the field of agents adaptive, personalized, software assistants has focused on information filtering. For example, NewT selects articles from USENET news groups for its user, based upon a profile of a person's reading habits built and modified over time <ref> [10] </ref>. Still, more research in techniques for information filtering needs to be done. 1.2 The Limitations of Content-based Filtering The common and obvious technique used to tackle the problem of information filtering is Content-based Filtering.

Reference-contexts: The use of these variations have not yet produced any significant improvements. 57 L = 0:7. 4.9 The Artist-Artist Algorithm The preceding algorithms discussed have dealt with measuring and employing similarities between users. Karl Sims proposed the use of correlations between artists to generate predictions <ref> [11] </ref>. The idea is simply an inversion of the previous methodologies. Say Ringo needs to predict how a user, Murray, will like "Harry Connick, Jr." Ringo would examine the artists that Murray has already rated.
