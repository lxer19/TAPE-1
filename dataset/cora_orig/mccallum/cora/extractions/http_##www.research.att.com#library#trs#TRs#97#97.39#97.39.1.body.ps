Title: Fixed fee versus unit pricing for information goods: competition, equilibria, and price wars

Abstract: Information goods have negligible marginal costs, and this will create possibilities for novel distribution and pricing methods. The main concern of this paper is with pricing of goods that are likely to be consumed in large quantities by individuals. For example, will software continue to be sold at a fixed price for each unit, or will it be paid for on the basis of usage? There is substantial evidence both from observing marketplace evolution and from surveys that customers overwhelmingly prefer subscription pricing. It turns out that even if we ignore this factor, peruse pricing is not a clear winner, and therefore when the preference effect is taken into account, subscription pricing is likely to dominate. We model competitive pricing between two companies that supply essentially equivalent services (such as movies or word processing software). One company charges a fixed fee per unit, while the other charges on a per-use basis. Each is interested in maximizing its revenue. We consider instances of the models that have stable competitive equilibria between suppliers along with situations that are unstable and, in the absence of collusion, lead to ruinous price wars.

Reference-contexts: Newspapers probably will be selling individual stories. All we suggest is that they will contribute a small part of total revenues, just as is true today. One of the few general results about the economics of bundling is the observation of Adams and Yellen <ref> [1] </ref> that mixed bundling (in which items are offered for sale separately, as well as in combination, but with the price of the individual items higher than they would be otherwise) is always better (with proper prices) than pure bundling, in which items are available only in combination.

Reference-contexts: While it is not true that bundling is always better than offering items separately, in most situations bundling is advantageous to the producers, since it depends only on moderate variations in preferences <ref> [2, 13] </ref> (see also [9] for various examples). Hence in the future we are likely to subscribe to electronic newspapers that carry wide ranges of stories (even though the selection of those stories might be personalized), and not buy individual stories. <p> Most of the discussion of the advantages of bundling in <ref> [2, 9] </ref>, for example, was about one-time sales of several different items, and the arguments were that bundling is likely to be advantageous to the producers in most cases.

Reference-contexts: After all, shareware revenues do provide comfortable living for many programmers, even though shareware is a small factor in the entire software industry.) Chuang and Sirbu <ref> [3] </ref> argue that publishers will benefit from a combination of unbundled and bundled sales of scholarly journal articles. <p> Further, even in those cases, the consumer preferences discussed in Section 2, which are hard to take into account in the conventional economic utility maximization model of <ref> [3] </ref>, suggest that the balance will be tilted more towards subscription pricing than individual article sales.

(iii) Hassle factor: In a per-use situation, consumers keep worrying whether each call is worth the money it costs, and it has been observed that their usage goes down <ref> [7] </ref>. A flat-rate plan allows them not to worry as to whether that call to their in-laws is really worth $0.05 per minute. All three factors are part of a general preference by consumers for simple and predictable pricing. <p> In addition to the consumer preference for flat-rate pricing, there are reasons for producers, especially in areas like software, where network externalities are important, to also like these plans. Since per-use pricing does repress usage <ref> [7] </ref>, it goes counter to the producer's desire that a software package be used as much as possible in order to lock customers into that product.

Reference-contexts: Since the majority of scholarly journals are purchased by academic libraries and not individuals, and this market is both unstable and full of perverse economic incentives not easily captured by standard economic models (see <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion of this subject), we feel that the Chuang and Sirbu analysis is most appropriate for publications aimed at individuals.

Reference-contexts: These people find it worthwhile to buy (or have their employer buy) the latest version of Word for just such use, and would benefit from per-use pricing. (See, for example, the discussion in <ref> [12] </ref>.) While there are obvious attractions to per-use pricing, the basic economic arguments based on utility theory are not as clear as for bundling, where those arguments strongly support the idea of selling combinations of items.
