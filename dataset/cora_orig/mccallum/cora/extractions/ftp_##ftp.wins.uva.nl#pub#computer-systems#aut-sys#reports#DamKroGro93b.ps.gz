Abstract: To represent the working environment of an autonomous mobile robot, occupancy grids can be used. This paper addresses the problem of how occupancy values from one occupancy grid can be used to calculate occupancy values in another grid, where the latter is rotated and/or translated with respect to the former. The mapping is described in terms of a neural network, of which the parameters are learned from examples. An activation function is derived taking into account that the input and output values represent probabilities in the occupancy grid. It is shown that the network performs a parallel Monte Carlo estimation of multiple volumes. It is also determined how many points should be taken into account in a learning sample to optimise the learning speed.

Reference-contexts: An occupancy grid partitions the robot's environment in a number of subspaces, each of which is represented by a cell. The cell-value gives the probability of the subspace being occupied by some obstacle. These grids can be used in mobile robot navigation <ref> [3, 5, 1] </ref> and in sensor data fusion [6, 4]. In our application we work with a local representation of the environment. Occupancy grids are defined to be `robot-fixed' and sensor data can be mapped directly onto these grids.

Reference-contexts: In order to merge data from these sensors a common representation is needed, which is often an internal representation of the geometry of the environment of the robot. A frequently used representation is an occupancy grid <ref> [2] </ref>. An occupancy grid partitions the robot's environment in a number of subspaces, each of which is represented by a cell. The cell-value gives the probability of the subspace being occupied by some obstacle.

Reference-contexts: The computation of the intersecting volume of two arbitrarily shaped cells at random positions is both mathematically and computationally a very hard problem. The fastest known mathematical method of approximating such volumes is Monte Carlo estimation (see, e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>). This section will show that the neural network introduced in the previous section performs an efficient Monte Carlo estimation on all weights w ij in parallel. Since the Monte Carlo method itself calculates estimates of single volumes w ij , this case is first treated in section 3.1.
