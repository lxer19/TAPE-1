Abstract: Educational and clinical techniques for language intervention in children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) focus on achieving a complete, speech-to-speech, communicative loop. To date, the AI technologies developed in areas like speech recognition, natural language processing, student modelling and intelligent tutoring have not been applied to the specific needs of children with ASD. In this paper we describe the design of Simone Says, a proposed software environment in which young children can practice semantically and socially meaningful language by playing a sort of interactive, linguistic game of Simon Says. Current research and practice in remediation both stress the need for achieving engagement and sustaining motivation in taking appropriate conversational turns and using language in functionally appropriate ways. Simone Says is intended to meet these requirements by using the natural attraction of computers to create opportunities for meaningful, speech-based language practice in a highly simplified social setting. In exercises that progress from vocabulary building to simple social conversation, the system will automatically generate contexts in which the student is rewarded for meaningful responses as defined by his or her current position along the normal developmental progression.

Reference-contexts: 1. Motivation The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) defines pervasive developmental disorders (alternatively, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD)) as a syndrome along three dimensions: Qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interaction, Qualitative impairment in communication, and Restricted, repetitive or stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests or activities <ref> [2] </ref>. Because the disorder is syndromic, subsets of symptoms and their severity vary across individuals, but onset in at least one area of dysfunction must occur before age three for this diagnosis. ASD is a neurologically-based, life-long disability occuring in about 2/1000 individuals.

Reference-contexts: Current clinical, social, and educational policy is designed to take advantage of critical periods in language development and neural plasticity by focusing on early detection and intervention. Although there has been extensive debate over which type of impairment constitutes the primary deficit of the disorder <ref> [4, 5, 9, 15, 19, 49, 50, 60, 62, 68] </ref>, we cannot overestimate the importance of establishing a basic language capability in children with ASD. Research has shown that meaningful speech by school-age is the single most predictive element of a favorable long-term prognosis [17, 54, 57].

Reference-contexts: A response of ``Eat'' alone is inadequate, an object for the verb is required.

As shown, we accomplish this by using a thought bubble with a miniature version of the target animation played inside it as a second response cue.

Reference-contexts: In more immediate terms, deficits in verbal expressive language have been found to be the most stressful type of impairment with which parents of children with ASD must cope <ref> [8] </ref>. Moreover, our ability to advance social and behavioral development may well hinge on improving the child's ability to communicate [53]. Some children with ASD never progress beyond the most basic forms of non-verbal communication.
