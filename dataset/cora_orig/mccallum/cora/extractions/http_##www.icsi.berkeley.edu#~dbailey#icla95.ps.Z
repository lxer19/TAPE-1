Title: Getting a Grip: A Computational Model of the Acquisition of Verb Semantics for Hand Actions  
Author: David Bailey 
Address: 1947 Center St. Suite 600, Berkeley CA 94704  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division, Univ. of California at Berkeley and International Computer Science Institute  
Abstract: We present a computational model of how verbs might be learned within the limited domain of hand actions. We hypothesize that such verbs refer to the activities of underlying motor schemas, and leverage this constraint to build a system with strong enough biases that it can learn from a reasonably small number of examples, while still having adequate flexibility to learn the hand-action verbs of any language. The completed system should demonstrate its knowledge both by labelling its own behavior and by carrying out verbal commands in a simulated world.

Reference-contexts: Schemas are meant to (crudely) capture the character of motor synergies <ref> (Bernstein 1967) </ref>, as well as Piaget's motor schemas (see Drescher (1991) for a computational version), and can be considered an analogue of visual image schemas.

Reference-contexts: A human-body animator connected to our system will be used to collect training data and to evaluate the trained system. This work is part of the L 0 language learning project <ref> (Feldman et al. 1990) </ref>, a theme of which is to bring together constraints from linguistics, psychology, neurobiology, and computer science, in order to discover underlying universals in cognitive representations. One such constraint derives from crosslinguistic variation.

Reference-contexts: The learning process involves three activities: 1. formation of word-sense f-structs as appropriate 2. determination of which features to include in each word-sense f-struct 3. finding the proper value or probability distribution for each included feature. Our current algorithm is Bayesian model-merging <ref> (Omohundro 1992) </ref>, a common and well tested probabilistic clustering technique. A key feature of this algorithm is its explicit, tunable mechanism for striking a balance between generating too many, very specific senses of a word, and generating too few, excessively general senses.
