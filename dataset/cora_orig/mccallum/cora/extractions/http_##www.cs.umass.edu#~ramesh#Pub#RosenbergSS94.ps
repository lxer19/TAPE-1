Reference-contexts: The upper-bound results of the current paper, which appear in Section 2, show that RRPs can perform, with close to optimal efficiency, any leveled tree-structured algorithm (LTS algorithm), i.e., any algorithm that 1 See, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref> for definitions. 3 can be specified in terms of a fixed number of complete up- and/or down-sweeps on complete binary trees, performing a unit-time task each time a tree-node is encountered.

Reference-contexts: Henceforth, we focus only on RRPsthat have been implemented so as to achieve logarithmic message latency|perhaps, but not necessarily, via Comet. The interested reader should see <ref> [6] </ref> for another theoretical study of reconfigurable architectures with logarithmic message latency. In the remainder of this section, we describe, in turn, our main results, the detailed architecture of RRPs, and the Comet message-passing protocol. <p> Clearly, a multireader bus capability would enable an N -RRP to perform one-to-all broadcasts in time proportional to log N ; however, this 2 It is instructive to see how our model and results compare with those of <ref> [6] </ref>. 3 Throughout, when we discuss the PEs of an N -RRP, all PE-indices are computed modulo N . 5 speedup would likely incur nonnegligible costs, as the multiple voltage drains would require either larger drivers, hence, a smaller RRP for a fixed amount of real estate, or slower CPEs, hence,

Reference-contexts: We are currently working on estimating the technological parameters that would enable our Cooperative Message Transmission (Comet) strategy to be realized. Our goal in the current paper, as in its companion paper <ref> [7] </ref>, is to understand the computational consequences of a fine-grain logarithmic delay model for RRPs: sufficiently good news would provide powerful motivation for paying the technological cost that would enable the model to be realized. <p> We denote an N -PE ring whose bus has L lines an (N; L)-RRP when we want to make all parameters explicit, an N -RRP when we want to concentrate only on the number of PEs, and an RRP when the specific parameter values are not consequential. In <ref> [7] </ref>, we showed that RRPs can efficiently execute any normal hypercube algorithm 1 , a class which contains efficient algorithms for such diverse problems as sorting, matrix multiplication, and the Fast Fourier Transform. <p> This strategy has been a major motivating factor for our work; its technological feasibility and costs are currently under study. Remark. The results in this paper, as those in <ref> [7] </ref>, rely only on the abstract properties of RRPs (such as logarithmic message latency) that are described in Section 1.3. Having said this, we would be very excited if the following design strategy could be developed to yield a "real" instantiation of the results. <p> As we stated in Section 1.1, our goal here is to determine whether or not logarithmic message latency leads to computational efficiency that would induce one to pursue vigorously a switch design that will efficiently support the Comet protocol. We believe that our upper bounds, here and in <ref> [7] </ref>, supply an affirmative answer to this question. Remark. We stress that the Comet protocol is intended to diminish only the capacitive delays of message transmission in MOS technologies; it does not affect transmission-line limitations.
