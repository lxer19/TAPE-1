Abstract: We develop the Redfield equation for delta-correlated gaussian noise and apply it to the case of two neutrino flavor or spin precession in the presence of a noisy matter density or magnetic field, respectively. The criteria under which physical fluctuations can be well approximated by the delta-correlated gaussian noise for the above cases are examined. Current limits on the possible neutrino magnetic moment and solar magnetic field suggest that a reasonably noisy solar magnetic field would not appreciably affect the solar electron neutrino flux. However, if the solar electron density has fluctuations of a few percent of the local density and a small enough correlation length, the MSW effect is suppressed for a range of parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Neutrino oscillations in the presence of matter and magnetic fields have been an area of intense study for approximately the last ten years. In the Mikheyev - Smirnov - Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, electron neutrinos on their journey from the core, are resonantly transformed into muon or tau neutrinos <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. If neutrinos are Majorana fermions with transition magnetic moments, they can undergo a magnetic resonant transformation into muon or tau antineutrinos [3]. Neutrinos from a supernovae explosion can be transformed from one flavor to another as they pass through the outer part of the star [4].

Although matter current effects become important only if the velocity is somewhat close to the speed of light, noisy mixing of matter would also mimic a fluctuating matter density. A priori, fluctuations in such fields may be well approximated by random noise added to an average value.

Reference-contexts: Enqvist and Semikoz considered neutrino oscillations in randomly fluctuating magnetic field, approximately, by averaging the coefficients in the third order differential equation for the z-component of the neutrino spin, in a constant matter density <ref> [10] </ref>. Their result suggested that the effect of the randomly fluctuating part of the magnetic field was similar to the effect of a larger (constant) matter density, hence reducing the neutrino precession.
