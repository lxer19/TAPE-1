Abstract: Introduction. This memorandum describes a package of commands to produce papers using the troff and nroff formatting programs on the UNIX system. As with other roff -derived programs, text is prepared interspersed with formatting commands. However, this package, which itself is written in troff commands, provides higher-level commands than those provided with the basic troff program. The commands available in this package are listed in Appendix A. To omit some of the standard headings (e.g. no abstract, or no author's institution) just omit the corresponding fields and command lines. The word ABSTRACT can be suppressed by writing ``.AB no'' for ``.AB''. Several interspersed .AU and .AI lines can be used for multiple authors. The headings are not compulsory: beginning with a .PP command is perfectly OK and will just start printing an ordinary paragraph. WWaarrnniinngg:: You can't just begin a document with a line of text. Some -ms command must precede any text input. When in doubt, use .LP to get proper initialization, although any of the commands .PP, .LP,

If you have to do Greek or mathematics, see eeqqnn <ref> [1] </ref> for equation setting. To aid eeqqnn users, -mmss provides definitions of .EQ and .EN which normally center the equation and set it off slightly. An argument on .EQ is taken to be an equation number and placed in the right margin near the equation.

The command .LP was used here. More sophisticated uses of .IP are also possible. <p> If there is both a format argument and an equation number, give the format argument first, as in for a left-adjusted equation numbered (1.3a). Similarly, the macros .TS and .TE are defined to separate tables (see <ref> [2] </ref>) from text with a little space. A very long table with a heading may be broken across pages by beginning it with .TS H instead of .TS, and placing the line .TH in the table data after the heading.
