Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract OSPF may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true of any link state protocol. In the absense of any explicit support to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Techniques have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the allocation of traffic.

Reference-contexts: in the topology and defining an algorithm which can allow autonomous unsyncronized decisions on the parts of many routers in a topology to quickly converge on a near optimal loading without the risk of oscillation. 2 Flooding Loading Information Loading information is flooded within an OSPF area using Opaque LSAs <ref> [1] </ref>. Area local scope (link-state type 10) link state attributes are flooded containing an "Opaque Type" of LSA OMP LINK LOAD or LSA OMP PATH LOAD. The type LSA OMP LINK LOAD Opaque LSA is used to flood link loading information within an area.

Reference-contexts: These attempts were doomed to failure because the adjustment increment was grossly course and oscillation was inevitable <ref> [2] </ref>. This early experience is largely responsible for the common belief that any form of load sensitive routing will fail due to severe oscillations resulting from instability. Attempts to use a metric composed of weighted components of delay, traffic, and fixed costs have also been met with very limited success.

Reference-contexts: The problem again is the granularity of adjustment. As the composition of weighted components switches favored paths large amounts of traffic are suddenly moved, making the technique prone to oscillations <ref> [3] </ref>. The oscillation is damped to some extent by providing a range of composite metric differences in which composite metrics are considered equal and equal cost multipath techniques are used.

Reference-contexts: The equivalent load figure is not intended to be an accurate pridiction of offerred load, simply a metric for use in deciding which link to o*oad. Mathis et al provide the following estimate of loss given TCP window size and round trip time <ref> [4] </ref>. p &lt; ( BW RT T The basis for the estimate is that TCP slows down roughly in proportion to the inverse of the square root of loss.
