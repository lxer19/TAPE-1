Title: Control of Systems Without Drift via Generic Loops  
Author: Eduardo D. Sontag 
Keyword: steering of nonholonomic systems, nonsingular controls, mechanical systems, nonlinear control, nonlinear feedback

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple numerical technique for the steering of arbitrary analytic systems with no drift. It is based on the generation of "nonsingular loops" which allow linearized controllability along suitable trajeto-ries. Once such loops are available, it is possible to employ standard Newton or steepest descent methods, as classically done in numerical control. The theoretical justification of the approach relies on recent results establishing the gener-icity of nonsingular controls, as well as a simple convergence lemma.

Reference-contexts: Also, these extensions can be done in such a manner that u x depends smoothly on x and is bounded by a constant multiple of fi (x). Finally, it is trivial to extend by antisymmetry to 8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, VOL. XX, NO.

An Illustration We now illustrate our technique with the simplest possi ble example of a system with no drift which is controllable but for which no possible smooth stabilizer exists.

Reference-contexts: A short program was written in order to simulate the behavior of the gradient descent algorithm based on the ideas described in this paper. As suggested earlier, periodic controls on intervals <ref> [0; 2] </ref> symmetric about are natural. In this case, in particular, the input u defined by u (t) 0, v (t) = sin (t) on this interval is already a universal nonsingular control (as shown next), so we use u. Nonsingularity is shown as follows.

Reference-contexts: An Illustration We now illustrate our technique with the simplest possi ble example of a system with no drift which is controllable but for which no possible smooth stabilizer exists. This example is due to Brockett ([2]) and appears in most textbooks in some variant or another (see e.g. <ref> [18] </ref>, Example 4.8.14); it is closely related, under a coordinate change, to the "unicycle" or "knife edge" example. <p> Since (B 0 B 1 ) = @ 0 1 0 0 1 has rank 3 generically, this shows that the linearized system is controllable (see e.g. <ref> [18] </ref>, Corollary 3.5.17). We simulated the gradient descent algorithm, using a simple line search consisting of optimizing the choice of the stepsize h after computing the gradient, and simulating 25 steps of the procedure for several different initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: This implies that the piecewise-constant control !, defined on [0; kffi] and equal to the values u 0 i on consecutive intervals of length ffi, is nonsingular for the given state x, as desired. We next need what is basically a restatement of the main results in <ref> [20] </ref>: Proposition A.1: Consider the (analytic) system (1) and assume that h : X ! IR is a real-analytic function. Let G be the set of states x so that, for some control ! = !(x), h ((; x; !)) is not identically zero. <p> Let ! fl be a control for the extended system which is universal with respect to observability. There are analytic such controls, and the desired genericity holds, by Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in <ref> [20] </ref>. Now pick any x in the set G. Then (x; 0) and (x; 1) are distinguishable, and hence ! fl distinguishes among them. This means that h ((; x; ! fl )) is not identically zero, as desired. We now prove Theorems 1 and 2.
