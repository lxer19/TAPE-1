Abstract: The linear complementarity problem (LCP) can be viewed as the problem of minimizing x T y subject to y = M x + q and x; y 0. We are interested in finding a point with x T y &lt; * for a given * &gt; 0: The algorithm proceeds by iteratively reducing the potential function ln x j y j ; where, for example, = 2n. The direction of movement in the original space can be viewed as follows. First, apply a linear scaling transformation to make the coordinates of the current point all equal to 1. Take a gradient step in the transformed space using the gradient of the transformed potential function, where the step size is either predetermined by the algorithm or decided by line search to minimize the value of the potential. Finally, map the point back to the original space. (I + Y 1 M X)(I + XM T Y 2 M X) 1 (I + XM T Y 1 ) where X and Y vary over the nonnegative diagonal matrices such that e T XY e * and X jj Y jj n 2 . If M is a P-matrix, fl is positive and the algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time in terms of the input size, j log *j, and 1= fl . It is also shown that when M is positive semi-definite, the choice of = 2n + f (x; y) = ln x T y

Reference-contexts: For example, if M has positive principal minors (i.e., M is a P -matrix <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> ), a unique solution exists for every q. Also, the problem of computing a Nash-equilibrium point in a two-person game can be reduced to an LCP with q = e = (1; ; 1) T and " A O where A and B have positive entries.

Reference-contexts: It is shown in <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> that there exists *, where log * is bounded by the input size, such that an exact solution can be easily computed from an *-complementary one. The analysis of this paper is related to the one presented by Karmarkar [ 3 ] for his linear programming algorithm. <p> Note that this reformulation preserves the P-matrix property. We may view *-complementary solutions of (LCP 0 ) as approximate solutions to (LCP ). It is important to note that given an *-complementary solution with * &lt; 2 L , a simple procedure finds an exact solution (see <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> ). Another possible initialization is as follows. If the original problem has an interior point, then any polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming can be employed to find an interior point where the value of the potential function is bounded by a polynomial in the input size. <p> Initializations that fit the above theorem and the next one were given elsewhere (see, for example, <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> ). 13 Theorem 7.3. If M is skew-symmetric (including the case of the linear programming problem) then, starting at any interior point where the potential value is O (nL), the algorithm converges in O (nL) iterations. Proof: In the skew-symmetric case we obtain better estimates as follows.
