Abstract: Accurate and efficient extraction of parasitic resistance is gaining more and more importance to achieve a high-speed high-performance digital system. In this paper, we proposed a superconvergence accelerated boundary element method (SA-BEM) to calculate parasitic resistances. Experimental results show that the SA-BEM can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed up over the traditional BEM and/or Method of Moment (MoM) approach. In addition, the whole resistance matrix can be obtained at one time.

Actually, since the method itself has O (h 2 ) residue with roof-top basis function, we do not need too accurate evaluation of the matrix entries.

SA-BEM uses 80 panels and get the resistance of 1.4680 in 0.37s CPU time, while the commercial FD solver uses 3000 grids and get 1.4654 in 4.33s CPU time. In <ref> [7] </ref>, 167 panels were used to get 1.4679. Due to the superconvergence acceleration used, we can use much smaller number of panels to achieve similar accuracy. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we adopted BEM/MoM accelerated by superconvergence to extract 2D resistance matrix of arbitrary region.

Reference-contexts: However, in extraction complex layout, we can take advantage of the so-called articulation nodes <ref> [8] </ref> to partition the geometries into small portions. An articulation node corresponds to equal-potential region or line. Therefore, most structures we need to extract is small-scale geometries, which means the problem size is small, and the asymptotic advantage of FEM/FD is lost.
