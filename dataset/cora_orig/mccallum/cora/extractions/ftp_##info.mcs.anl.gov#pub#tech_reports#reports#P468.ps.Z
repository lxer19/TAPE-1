Reference-contexts: Therefore, vascular compressibility may be important to understanding other physiological processes related to blood vessels, such as the transport of interstitial fluid. 1 Inelasticity of the vessel wall. That blood vessel walls exhibit inelastic behavior such as length-tension and pressure-diameter hysteresis, stress relaxation, and creep has been reported extensively <ref> [1] </ref>, [10]. However, blood vessels are able to maintain stability and contain the pressure and flow of blood under a variety of physiological conditions. These conditions are dynamic, but slowly varying with a large static component. Residual stress and strain.

Reference-contexts: However, few investigators have incorporated macroscopic inhomogeneity into studies of vascular mechanics [17]. Incompressibility of the vessel wall. Experimental measurement of wall compressibility of 0.06% at 270 cm of H 2 O indicates that the vessel can be considered incompressible when subjected to physiological pressure and load <ref> [2] </ref>. In terms of the mechanical behavior of blood vessels, this is small relative to the large magnitude of the distortional strains that occur when blood vessels are deformed under the same conditions.

Reference-contexts: The stresses are computed from the strain energy by the following: oe i = i @ i We make the following transformation <ref> [3] </ref> = q ; (28) which upon differentiation gives r dr After these expressions and the stresses in terms of the strain energy density function are introduced into the equilibrium equation we obtain an ordinary differential equation for p: dp = fi ; W fl fi 3 ; r (30) subject

Reference-contexts: This configuration also, seems to be a reasonable choice for the reference configuration. However, this ignores residual stress and strain effects that have been the subject of current research <ref> [4] </ref>, [16], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Blood vessels are formed in a dynamic environment which gives rise to imbalances between the forces that tend to extend the diameter and length and the internal forces that tend to resist this extension. <p> If fi &lt; 1, the cylindrical shape is unstable, but a thin section will tend to overlap itself. 4 In Choung and Fung's formulation, fi = =fi 0 , where the angle fi 0 is half the angle spanned by the open annular section <ref> [4] </ref>. For cylindrical blood vessels there are two assumed constraints. The first assumption is that the longitudinal strain is uniform through the wall and therefore z = = a constant (6) for any cylindrical configuration.

Reference-contexts: Circumferential retraction of medium-caliber blood vessels, such as the carotid, illiac, and bracheal arteries, can exceed 70% following reduction of internal blood pressure to zero. In the case of the carotid artery, the amount of longitudinal retraction tends to increase during growth and to decrease in subsequent aging <ref> [5] </ref>. It would seem reasonable to assume that blood vessels are in a nearly stress-free state when they are fully retracted and free of external loads. This configuration also, seems to be a reasonable choice for the reference configuration.

Reference-contexts: The number of elastic lamellae depends upon the wall thickness and the anatomical location [18]. In the case of the canine carotid, the elastic lamellae account for a major component of the static structural response of the blood vessel <ref> [6] </ref>. This response is modulated by the smooth muscle cells, which have the ability to actively change the mechanical characteristics of the wall [7]. The adventitia consists of loose, more disorganized fiberous connective tissue, which may have less influence on mechanics.

Axisymmetric Deformation In the following discussion we will concern ourselves with deformation of cylindrical tubes, see Fig. 1. <p> 2 1 R 2 As a result, the principal stretch ratios can be expressed in terms of R as follows: r = q ; (15) s fi c 2 5 Experimental Measurements The basic experimental setup required to measure the mechanical properties of blood vessels in vitro is described in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The physiological implications are that vascular tissue is in a constant state of flux. New tissue is synthesized in a state of stress that allows it to redistribute the internal 15 loads more uniformly. There probably is no stress-free reference state <ref> [8] </ref>, [11], and [12].

Residual stress and strain. <p> This property suggest a strong elastic component, which has been called the pseudoelasticity <ref> [10] </ref>. This elastic response can be characterized by a single potential function called the strain energy density. It is a scalar function of the strains that determines the amount of stored elastic energy per unit volume. <p> They found better correlation with order-three polynomials over order-two, but order-four polynomials did not warrant the addition work. Later, Fung et al. <ref> [10] </ref> found very good correlation with an expression of the form W = 2 h e fl2 z e fl2 e fl i for the canine carotid artery, where e fl and e fl z are the strains in a reference configuration at in situ length and pressure.

However, this ignores residual stress and strain effects that have been the subject of current research [4], [16], [11], [12], <ref> [13] </ref>, [14]. Blood vessels are formed in a dynamic environment which gives rise to imbalances between the forces that tend to extend the diameter and length and the internal forces that tend to resist this extension. <p> When residual stresses are considered, the stress distributions flatten considerably and become almost uniform at in situ length and pressure. fi = 1 and fi = 1:11. Takamizawa and Hayashi have even considered the case where the strain distribution is uniform in situ <ref> [13] </ref>. The physiological implications are that vascular tissue is in a constant state of flux. New tissue is synthesized in a state of stress that allows it to redistribute the internal 15 loads more uniformly. There probably is no stress-free reference state [8], [11], and [12].

Reference-contexts: it is convenient to formulate the strain energy density in terms of the Lagrangian strains, e i = 2 i 1) ; (47) and in this case we can consider polynomials of the lagrangian strains, q n (e r ; e ; e z ). isotropic tube Vaishnav et al. <ref> [15] </ref> proposed using a polynomial of the form W fl = i=2 j=0 ij z (48) to approximate the behavior of the canine aorta. They found better correlation with order-three polynomials over order-two, but order-four polynomials did not warrant the addition work.

Vascular Anatomy A blood vessel can be divided anatomically into three distinct cylidrical sections when viewed under the optical microscope. Starting at the inside of the vessel they are the intima, the media, and the adventitia.

Reference-contexts: For this reason the the assumption of vessel wall homogeneity is applied cautiously. Such an assumption may be valid only within distinct macroscopic structures. However, few investigators have incorporated macroscopic inhomogeneity into studies of vascular mechanics <ref> [17] </ref>. Incompressibility of the vessel wall. Experimental measurement of wall compressibility of 0.06% at 270 cm of H 2 O indicates that the vessel can be considered incompressible when subjected to physiological pressure and load [2].

Reference-contexts: The elastic lamellae are composed principally of the fiberous protein elastin. The number of elastic lamellae depends upon the wall thickness and the anatomical location <ref> [18] </ref>. In the case of the canine carotid, the elastic lamellae account for a major component of the static structural response of the blood vessel [6]. This response is modulated by the smooth muscle cells, which have the ability to actively change the mechanical characteristics of the wall [7].
