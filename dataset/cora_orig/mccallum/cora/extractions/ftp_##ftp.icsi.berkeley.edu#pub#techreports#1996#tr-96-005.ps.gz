Abstract: We present an algorithm to compute a full set of irreducible representations of a supersolvable group G over a finite field K, charK =j jGj, which is not assumed to be a splitting field of G. The main subroutines of our algorithm are a modification of the algorithm of Baum and Clausen [1] to obtain information on algebraically conjugate representations, and an effective version of Speiser's generalization of Hilbert's Theorem 90 stating that H 1 (Gal(L=K); GL(n; L)) vanishes for all n 1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Main Results Recently Baum and Clausen <ref> [1] </ref> published an efficient algorithm for computing the absolutely irreducible representations of a supersolvable group G given in pc-presentation. <p> For the rest of this section we set T i := (G i &gt; G i1 &gt; &gt; G 0 = f1g) for 1 i n. In particular, T = T n . 2 The algorithm of Baum and Clausen in <ref> [1] </ref> computes the list F ; we modify this algorithm to obtain additional information on the orbits of F under the action of the Galois group of L=K; this information is encoded as the permutation fl. Our algorithm works bottom up along T . <p> D 2 D. (3) A permutation ffi of D such that D ff ~ ffiD, as well as e-monomial matrices N D 2 Int (D ff ; ffiD), D 2 D; Outputs (1) and (2) are computed in exactly the same way as in the algorithm of Baum and Clausen <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore, we only discuss the computation of Output (3) and assume that we have already performed the two phases of the algorithm in [1]. <p> (D ff ; ffiD), D 2 D; Outputs (1) and (2) are computed in exactly the same way as in the algorithm of Baum and Clausen <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore, we only discuss the computation of Output (3) and assume that we have already performed the two phases of the algorithm in [1]. Note that during the construction at level i in Phase 1 there is built a bipartite graph in which F 2 F and D 2 D are linked iff F is a constituent of D # G i1 . <p> In the following we show that such an x i always exists and prove that the matrix T obtained by our algorithm is in fact a realization of F over M . Let T 2 L ffif have columns T <ref> [1] </ref>; : : :; T [f ].

Reference-contexts: exponent of G, and D and are two equivalent irreducible T -adapted representations of LG of degree d, say, then the intertwining space Int (D; ) := fX 2 L dfid j 8 g 2 G : XD (g) = (g)Xg is generated over L by a monomial matrix (see <ref> [2, Theorem 7.4] </ref>). Now let K be a finite field, G be a supersolvable group such that charK =j jGj, T be a chief series of G, and L be a finite extension of K which contains a primitive eth root of unity.

Reference-contexts: The question whether an absolutely irreducible representation D of G has a realization over K () is hard to answer in general, i.e., for arbitrary K and arbitrary G. (This amounts to the question whether the Schur-index of the character of D equals 1, see <ref> [3, Kapitel V, x14] </ref>.) It is however well-known that for finite fields and arbitrary finite groups the question has an affirmative answer [3, Kapitel V, Satz 14.10]. In theory we thus know that any irreducible matrix representation D of LG has a realization over its character field. <p> hard to answer in general, i.e., for arbitrary K and arbitrary G.

In theory we thus know that any irreducible matrix representation D of LG has a realization over its character field. <p> We then proceed by computing a realization of the trace of T F F T 1 F over K. It is well known that any absolutely irreducibley representation of LG has a realization over its character field <ref> [3, Kapitel V, Satz 14.10] </ref>. We would like to give here a proof of this fact which builds the basis of our algorithm to find such a realization. <p> Replacing S by dS if necessary, we obtain the existence of T , a realization of F over its character field. (See also <ref> [3, Kapitel V, Bemerkung 14.14] </ref>.) From the second step we know ` := [L: K]=d F and an e-monomial matrix S = S F 2 Int (F fi ; F ), fi = ff d F . Let S =: P diag (S (1); : : :; S (f )).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, Tr K (D) is an irreducible KG-representation (since any of its irreducible constituents over K has to be invariant under ); conversely, any irreducible KG-representation is the trace over K of some irreducible representation of LG. (For these and related facts see <ref> [4, Chapter VII, x1] </ref>.) To obtain the irreducible representations of KG we first compute a set F 0 of representatives of Gal (L=K)- orbits of irreducible representations of LG, and for each such representation a realization of its trace over K.

Reference-contexts: Both these strategies consume exponential 6 time, and it seems that in practice a correct implementation of any of these strategies is rather complicated. Nevertheless, we have implemented our algorithm in the computer algebra system GAP <ref> [5] </ref>. In this implementation the final step is performed by using a table of Jacobi logarithms for L, which needs exponential space (and time). Although it is impractical for large jLj, this strategy performs well for small sizes of L.

Reference-contexts: A generalization of Hilbert's Theorem 90 due to Speiser [7] states that the first cohomology H 1 (hfii; GL (d; L)) is trivial. (This is a modern interpretation of Speiser's result; see also <ref> [6, Chapter X, x1] </ref>.) Hence, for S 2 GL (d; L) there exists T 2 GL (d; L) such that T 1 T fi = S if and only if the norm S fi `1 S fi S of S equals the n fi n-identity matrix I n . <p> By Speiser's Theorem [7] mentioned in the introduction such a matrix T exists iff N L=M (S) = I f . (Speiser's original proof works only over infinite fields; for a general proof, see <ref> [6, page 151] </ref>.) A straightforward calculation shows that N L=M (S) 2 Int (F; F ). Hence, Schur's Lemma implies that N L=M (S) = cI f for some c 2 L.

Reference-contexts: If M is the character field of D, then D is equivalent to D fi , hence Int (D; D fi ) is generated by an invertible matrix S. A generalization of Hilbert's Theorem 90 due to Speiser <ref> [7] </ref> states that the first cohomology H 1 (hfii; GL (d; L)) is trivial. (This is a modern interpretation of Speiser's result; see also [6, Chapter X, x1].) Hence, for S 2 GL (d; L) there exists T 2 GL (d; L) such that T 1 T fi = S if <p> Suppose that there exists T 2 GL (f; L) such that T 1 T fi = S. Then, SF S 1 = F fi implies that T F T 1 is invariant under fi, hence T is a realization of F over M . By Speiser's Theorem <ref> [7] </ref> mentioned in the introduction such a matrix T exists iff N L=M (S) = I f . (Speiser's original proof works only over infinite fields; for a general proof, see [6, page 151].) A straightforward calculation shows that N L=M (S) 2 Int (F; F ).
