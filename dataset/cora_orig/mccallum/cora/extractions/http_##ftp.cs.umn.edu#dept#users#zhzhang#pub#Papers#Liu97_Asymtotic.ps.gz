Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the stationary backlog distribution in a single server queue with constant service capacity c, fed by the so-called "M=G=1 input process" or "Cox input process". Asymptotic lower bounds are obtained for any distribution G and asymptotic upper bounds are derived when G is a subexponential distribution. We find the bounds to be tight in some instances, e.g., G corresponding to either the Pareto or lognormal distribution and c &lt; 1, where is the arrival rate to the buffer. fl This work was performed in part while D. Towsley and Z.-L. Zhang were visiting INRIA. It was also funded in part by the National Science Foundation under grants NCR-9508274, NCR-9623807, and CDA 9502639.

Reference-contexts: One such model that has received attention is a buffer with server having rate c fed by an M=G=1 input process where G is heavy-tailed (e.g., <ref> [1, 12, 19, 27] </ref>). This is of interest because of its versatility, i.e., the dependencies over different time-scales can be controlled by varying the tail behavior of G. In this paper we consider the model introduced by Parulekar and Makowski [27].

Reference-contexts: An appealing feature of the (stationary version of the) input process fb t ; t 2 INg is that it is a long-range dependent process <ref> [2] </ref> for some well-chosen subexponential c.d.f.'s G (see Section 2). Let Q t be the queue-length at the multiplexer at time t. Then, Q t satisfies the Lindley's equation Q t+1 = max (0; Q t + b t c) for all t 2 IN, with Q 0 = 0. <p> First, it has been shown in [11, formula (5.39)] that cov (b t ; b t+h ) = G 1 (h) for all t; h 2 IN. Therefore, the stationary process fb t ; t 2 INg will be long-range dependent <ref> [2] </ref> if P 1 h=0 G 1 (h) = 1, which will occur, for instance, when G is Pareto (i.e. G (x) ~ x ff ) with parameter 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2. Remark 2.1 By taking integer-valued service times our model reduces to that in [27].

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that the supremum in the r.h.s. of (23) is strictly positive if and only if G 1 2 D. Indeed, it follows from <ref> [3, Corollary 2.0.6, p. 65] </ref> that if lim inf x!1 G 1 (x)=G 1 (ffix) is strictly positive for some ffi 2 (0; 1) then this limit is strictly positive for all ffi 2 (0; 1), and in particular for ffi = 1=2. <p> Since G 1 is non-increasing, it is easy to see from <ref> [3, Corollary 2.0.6] </ref> that L &gt; 0 is equivalent to G 1 2 D. Hence, both bounds in Proposition 3.2 and in [19] are non-trivial if and only if G 1 2 D.

We conclude this section by pointing out an interesting feature (already observed in <ref> [27, p. 1455] </ref>) of the process fb t ; t 2 INg defined in (4). First, it has been shown in [11, formula (5.39)] that cov (b t ; b t+h ) = G 1 (h) for all t; h 2 IN. <p> G (x) ~ x ff ) with parameter 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2. Remark 2.1 By taking integer-valued service times our model reduces to that in <ref> [27] </ref>. <p> the case of integer-valued service times the number of busy servers at time t + 1 is the same whether customers entering the M/G/1 queue in (t; t + 1) begin their service upon arrival (as in our model) or begin their service at time t + 1 (as in <ref> [27] </ref>). 3 Lower Bounds The following representation of A (0; t) := P t1 s=0 b s will prove useful: A (0; t) = s=0 = s=0 X I (^ j &gt; s) + s=0 k=0 kT j &lt;k+1 4 = X t1 X I (^ j &gt; s) + k=0

Reference-contexts: Duffield observed in [12] that the approach in [27], based on the Gartner-Ellis theorem, cannot be used to derive large deviations lower bounds for heavy-tailed G. By refining Theorem 2.2 in [13] and by using results in <ref> [28] </ref> Duffield was able to obtain the following large deviations upper bound (see [12]) lim sup log P (Q &gt; x) 1 (ff 1)(c ) (3) in the case of the Pareto distribution G (x) ~ c 1 x ff .

Reference-contexts: In the following the bounds in (1) will be referred to as large deviations bounds. Asymptotic upper and lower bounds for P (Q &gt; x) are also obtained. Large deviations bounds were obtained in <ref> [29] </ref> in the case when G is short-tailed. Duffield observed in [12] that the approach in [27], based on the Gartner-Ellis theorem, cannot be used to derive large deviations lower bounds for heavy-tailed G.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent discovery <ref> [16, 21, 30] </ref> that traffic in networks possess long-range time dependencies that cannot be easily captured by Poisson-based models has motivated queueing theorists to propose and analyze new queueing models that capture these dependencies.

Reference-contexts: Other models have been proposed for modeling the effects of long-range dependence in arrival processes on buffer occupancy statistics. These include fractional brownian motion [13, 25], fractional gaussian noise [27], and a finite population of on-off sources where the on state holding times are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions <ref> [5, 7, 9, 18, 19, 22, 31] </ref> (see [6] for a survey on fluid queues with long-tailed activity periods).

Reference-contexts: s (t) s=0 b 0 j=1 On the other hand, the stationarity and ergodicity of the sequence fb t ; t 2 INg together with = E [b 0 ] &lt; 1 (see Lemma 2.1) yields lim 1 t1 X b s = a.s. (19) from ergodic theory (see e.g. <ref> [32, Chapter V] </ref>). We therefore deduce from (18)-(19) that lim inf 1 t1 X a s (t) a.s. (20) since P b 0 j=1 ^ j &lt; 1 a.s. by Lemma 2.1.
