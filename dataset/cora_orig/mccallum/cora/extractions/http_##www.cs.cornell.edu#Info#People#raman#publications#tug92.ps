Abstract: Till now, (L A )T E X has been used to generate typeset documents. This paper points out an alternative view | the generation of audio renderings. The (L A )T E X typesetting source captures a lot of document structure which is then used to typeset the document. This can be exploited to convey document structure in audio renderings of the document as well. This becomes especially important when dealing with mathematical documents. Our approach attempts to develop notions of audio formatting similar to the well understood notions of visual formatting and layout. Our goal is to do for the audio document what (L A )T E X has done for the printed document.

Reference-contexts: Both of these features are absent in traditional spoken mathematics. Spoken mathematics on tape is linear in time. In addition, it tends to be verbose since there is no standard way of alerting the listener to complicated syntactic constructions other than describing these verbosely (see Chang <ref> [Cha83] </ref>, which is used as a guideline by rfb for reading mathematical texts). This can be directly attributed to the apparent lack in audio of the two-dimensional nature of the printed medium.

Reference-contexts: Similar structures are also easy to obtain from well written T E X documents where the structure is marked up using macros from standard packages such as plain T E X <ref> [Knu84] </ref>. However, since T E X does not always insist on the use of predefined structures for marking up the document, this step can prove difficult when dealing with "raw" T E X documents.

T E X as described by Knuth <ref> [Knu84, Knu86] </ref> is a powerful typesetting language and embodies many features of a programming language. By providing primitives normally found in a programming language it affords immense flexibility to the designer of a document.

Reference-contexts: L A T E X documents have this structure clearly tagged by the use of standard L A T E X constructs and this allows us to get at the high level structure <ref> [Lam86] </ref>. Similar structures are also easy to obtain from well written T E X documents where the structure is marked up using macros from standard packages such as plain T E X [Knu84].

Reference-contexts: As these concepts become better understood, we need to work towards the development of a language for representing structured information in electronic documents. Some of this has already been achieved by SGML 4 <ref> [SGM86, Org90] </ref> and there is a clear need to carry over this work to cover mathematical documents as well.

Reference-contexts: Reading the (L A )T E X source directly is impractical, since you have to listen to a stream of "backslash" and other extraneous utterances. This first attempt resulted in the development of T E XT A LK <ref> [Ram91] </ref>, a program that I continue to use for my day-to-day work as a graduate student at Cornell. This program carries out simple transformations on the (L A )T E X source and the resulting text can be viewed using standard unix tools.
