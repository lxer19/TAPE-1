Title: Matching Events in a Content-based Subscription System  
Author: Marcos K. Aguilera Robert E. Strom Daniel C. Sturman Mark Astley Tushar D. Chandra 
Date: November 10, 1998  
Abstract: Content-based publish/subscribe systems are an emerging alternative to traditional group-based systems, because they permit more flexible subscriptions along multiple dimensions. In these systems, each subscription is a predicate which may test arbitrary fields within an event. However, the matching problem for content-based systems | determining for each event the subset of all subscriptions whose predicates match the event | is still an open problem. We present an efficient, scalable solution to the matching problem. Our algorithm is the first one to have a time complexity that is sub-linear in the number of subscriptions, and a space complexity that is linear. Specifically, we prove that for predicates reducible to conjunctions of elementary tests, the expected time to match a random event is no greater than O(N 1 ) where N is the number of subscriptions, and is a closed-form expression that depends on the number and type of attributes (in many cases, 1=2). We show some techniques for modifying our algorithm to improve the search time, and show the results of simulations which validate the theoretical bounds and show acceptable performance levels for complex predicates and tens of thousands of subscriptions.

Reference-contexts: Publishers are informed of subscriptions so that they may "quench" events (not generate events) for which there are no subscribers. In [SA97], plans are discussed for optimizing Elvin event matching by integrating an algorithm similar to the one in this paper. This algorithm, presented in <ref> [GS95] </ref>, converts subscriptions into a deterministic finite automata for matching. However, the main difference between [GS95] and our work is that we seek matching algorithms with (worst-case) space complexity linear in the number of subscriptions, while in [GS95], the space complexity is exponential. <p> In [SA97], plans are discussed for optimizing Elvin event matching by integrating an algorithm similar to the one in this paper.
