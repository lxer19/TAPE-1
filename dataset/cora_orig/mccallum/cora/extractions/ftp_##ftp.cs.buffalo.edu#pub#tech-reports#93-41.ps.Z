Title: Efficient Average-Case Algorithms for the Modular Group  
Author: Jin-Yi Cai Wolfgang H. Fuchs Dexter Kozen Zicheng Liu

Affiliation: SUNY  Cornell University  Cornell University  Princeton University  
Abstract: The modular group occupies a central position in many branches of mathematical sciences. In this paper we give average polynomial-time algorithms for the unbounded and bounded membership problems for finitely generated subgroups of the modular group. The latter result affirms a conjecture of Gurevich [5].

Our observation that minimal-length representations in (2.3) and (iii) are mutually proportional implies that the size of A in representation (iii) is also polynomial in the size of A in representation (i) on average.
