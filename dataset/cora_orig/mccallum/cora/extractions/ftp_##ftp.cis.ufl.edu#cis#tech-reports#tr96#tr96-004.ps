Abstract: The two primary methods of simulating soft-sphere particle systems are Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo. Researchers have recently combined the two methods into a single Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which combines the potential barrier-crossing ability of Monte Carlo with the large moves in phase space possible through Molecular Dynamics. We extend the algorithm by applying randomized selection to the Molecular Dynamics aspect of the hybrid model. By simulating a 2-D periodic box of Lennard-Jonesium, we show that our approach can reduce the computational cost of the hybrid model by up to 50%, without compromising the accuracy of the simulation.

Reference-contexts: Initially, the particles were arranged on a 10 fi 10 2-D rectangular lattice, with periodic boundary conditions. In terms of reduced units of energy (E fl E=*), length (r fl r=) and time (t fl p <ref> [Allen and Tildesley 1992] </ref>, the simulations were run at a temperature of 2.0. The particle density was 0.83. For each experiment, the system was then simulated with ordinary MD, using an ordinary velocity rescaling scheme, until equilibrium conditions were reached. At this point, the randomized HMC algorithm began. <p> for a total of 200,000 MD steps. 4.2 Determining Efficiency For purposes of measurement, we considered the specific heat capacity, C V , in the canonical ensemble, C V = &lt; ffiE 2 &gt; k B T 2 ; where &lt;ffiE 2 &gt; is the variance of the total energy <ref> [Allen and Tildesley 1992] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As a result, it can take a long time for distant areas of phase space to be sampled. Recent research has seen the development of hybrid models, in which the properties of MC are combined with those of MD. Guarnieri and Still <ref> [Guarnieri and Still 1994] </ref> developed an alternating MC / Stochastic Dynamics scheme, which was found to sample a system of n-pentane molecules significantly faster than MC or Stochastic Dynamics alone.

Reference-contexts: At the beginning of each cycle, the particle velocities are redistributed according to a Gaussian distribution consistent with the system temperature. From that point, a series of MD steps are taken, leading to a new configuration. This configuration is then accepted or rejected according to standard MC criteria <ref> [Metropolis et al. 1953] </ref>. If rejected, the positions at the beginning of the MD run are restored. Either way, the cycle begins again, starting with the redistribution of particle velocities.

Reference-contexts: One advantage is that potential barriers can be crossed more easily than with MD. However, because MC is essentially a random walk through phase space, its expected distance after N steps is p N <ref> [Neal 1993] </ref>. As a result, it can take a long time for distant areas of phase space to be sampled.
