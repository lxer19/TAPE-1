Note: Abstract  
Abstract: Since 1985 the terminological representation system BACK (Berlin advanced computational knowledge representation system) has been developed at the Technical University Berlin. Its origin lies in the KL-ONE-based knowledge representation paradigm, semantic networks, and frame-based representation languages. The current system version has gone through several changes not only on the implementational level, but also on the conceptual level. For some time now the syntax has stabilized, and larger applications may be approached in the future. Until now, introductions to the BACK system as well as its representation language were distributed throughout several publications, making it difficult for users to learn to handle the system. Hence, we found it worthwhile to write a tutorial guide through the BACK system. With BACK V5 the representation language has changed. On the one hand it became much more uniformer than in previous versions, on the other hand it was extended by some useful constructs which allow an easier customization of the language. Thus, we felt also the need for a user manual documenting the revised language. The first part of this report is a tutorial introduction into the BACK system, which describes by example the modeling process we find most appropriate for terminological modeling with BACK. The second part is written in the form of a user manual, describing the modified and newly introduced language constructs.
