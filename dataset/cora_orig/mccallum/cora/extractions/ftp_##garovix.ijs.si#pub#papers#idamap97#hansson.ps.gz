Abstract: Monitoring and therapy planning in real-world environments highly depend on good patient-disease models. The improvement of the technical equipment in modern intensive care units enables a huge number of on- and off-line data, which results in an information overload of the medical staff. Additionally, the underlying medical structure-function models are poorly understood or not applicable due to incomplete knowledge. We have developed an on-line identification scheme, which utilizes a priori knowledge as well as on-line measurements to identify the parameters of a disease model for mechanically ventilated newborn infants. The scheme benefits from an exponential weighting function to classify more recent measurement values as more important. We have evaluated our identification scheme with real medical data sets showing the benefits and drawbacks of our ap proach.

Reference-contexts: It should be made clear that the challenge from medicine on computations for data analysis and therapy planning is much greater that the challenges from many other fields <ref> [ Bellman, 1983 ] </ref> . Hence it is not surprising that a multidisciplinary approach is a good idea. <p> The model is in terms of a difference equation that describes the real world with some degree of accuracy. This type of models has been used extensively in medical applications of mathematics <ref> [ Bellman, 1983 ] </ref> . It is especially useful in case Control Theory is going to be used to synthesize the therapy planning. However, it can also be used to derive qualitative models suitable for AI approaches.

Reference-contexts: System identification with no constraints or just equality constraints on the parameters has been treated in textbooks [ Johansson, 1993 ] , but the case with more complicated constraints, such as inequality constraints, is still an active research area, see e.g., <ref> [ Boyd et al., 1994 ] </ref> . The data used in the identification scheme is weighted exponentially in time in order to take into account that more recently observed data are more important for the model than old data. This is a standard approach in system identification. <p> This is what has to be sacrificed in order to rewrite the model in the above form. 4 Identification Scheme In this section the identification scheme will be described. It will be seen how it can be cast as a so called Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem, see <ref> [ Boyd et al., 1994 ] </ref> . Before defining the optimization problem that will yield the identified parameters, the model will be rewritten as a linear regression. <p> &gt; &gt; ; Then E () = Y , and with fl = diag 0 k=N1 ( k ) it holds that V (; N ) = E T ()flE (), and hence the opti mization problem can be written min E T ()flE () It can be shown, see <ref> [ Boyd et al., 1994 ] </ref> , that this problem is equivalent to min t 8 I fl (Y ) p 9 l : : u The first inequality constraint says that the matrix should be positive semi-definite. <p> Hence this constraint is an LMI. The second constraint is also linear in the variable , and it can also be rewritten as an LMI. This shows that the optimization problem is a so called LMI-problem that can be solved with highly efficient algorithms, see e.g., <ref> [ Boyd et al., 1994 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Currently, the problem of automating the data analysis has grown steadily under the labels knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining <ref> [ Fayyad et al., 1996 ] </ref> . Nevertheless, these approaches are based on the assumption that there exists a particular domain model, which only need to be customized for the particular purpose. This assumption is not always applicable in a real-world environment.

Reference-contexts: This assumption is not always applicable in a real-world environment. We are particularly interested in the treatment of mechanically ventilated newborn infants. Mechanical ventilation has greatly contributed towards the improvement of the mortality and morbidity of prematurely newborn infants <ref> [ Goldsmith and Karotkin, 1993 ] </ref> . Enhanced knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms of barotrauma and oxygen toxicity led to the development of patient-tailored strategies of mechanical ventilation and helped to reduce harmful side effects of respirator therapy.

Reference-contexts: In a first step, the experiences with VIE-VENT and medical textbook knowledge were incorporated in an "open-patien" model <ref> [ Gutmayer, 1995 ] </ref> . The main purposes of this approach were to structure the vague causal and functional domain knowledge and to develop a training system for inexperienced physicians. The primary drawback was that the available knowledge was still too incomplete to apply qualitative reasoning techniques for therapy planning. <p> The model utilizes the experiences and the knowledge gathered from the development of VIE-VENT [ Miksch et al., 1996 ] and of the "open-patient" model <ref> [ Gutmayer, 1995 ] </ref> . This a priori knowledge was acquired in cooperation with expert physicians. We dis cussed different medical histories and visualized particular sample cases to structure the necessary elements. The a priori knowledge describes the relationship between the blood-gas measurements, e.g. <p> In the evaluation we are using the on-line, continuously-assessed measurements, e.g., P tc O 2 (trans-cutaneous partial pressure of oxygen). Beceause of the piecewise linear relationship it is possible to preprocess the data to take this into account. It is fairly straightforward to see from <ref> [ Gutmayer, 1995 ] </ref> that the partial pressure of oxygen, P a O 2 obeys the difference equation P a O 2 (k + 1) = W Q s W D const W K fi + W F iO 2 (k) + W P EEP (k) + W V T (k)

Reference-contexts: F iO 2 (fraction of inspired oxygen), P EEP (positive end expiratory pressure).

Hence good identification without any a priori knowledge about the parameters is only possible if the input signals are varying enough.
