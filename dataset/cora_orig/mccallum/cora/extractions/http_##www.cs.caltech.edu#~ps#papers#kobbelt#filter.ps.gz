Abstract: A new technique to analyse the smoothness of the limiting curves generated by interpolatory refinement schemes is presented. In this approach the refinement schemes are characterized as discrete low pass filters and the convergence analysis is done in the frequency domain. The class of subdivision schemes covered by this approach includes not only the stationary subdivision schemes but also a very general class of refinement schemes with global dependence of the new points on the old. This filter formalism can be used for both, the analysis and the construction of interpolatory refinement schemes.

Reference-contexts: Usually in the literature there is no strict distinction between interpolatory and non-interpolatory refinement. In this paper we restrict to the interpolatory case since this enables us to exploit some convergence results for global refinement schemes stated in section 3.

Reference-contexts: Notice that this particular refinement scheme belongs to the class of schemes presented in the last subsection with ff = 1 20 . 5.3 Stationary refinement In <ref> [DD89] </ref> a special class of stationary refinement schemes, the Lagrange-schemes, are defined in the following way.

Reference-contexts: In the case ff = 1 20 the filter function has a root of order 6 and we even get C 4 - curves. Notice that ff = 1 16 reproduces the 4-point scheme of <ref> [DGL87] </ref>. To prove these higher regularities, one has to collect several refinement steps.

Reference-contexts: A more general approach is to allow the linear combination to vary in every step, i.e., using coefficients ff m j <ref> [DL94] </ref>. These schemes are called non-stationary . Additionally, one can vary the weights with the index i, i.e., ff m i;j which leads to non-uniform schemes [Qu92], [War95].

Reference-contexts: Then lim P m = g 2 C k ; dx k g = f () lim 2 km 4 k P m = f 2 C 0 : Proof The proof of this lemma is omitted here for shortness (cf. <ref> [Kob94] </ref>). Notice that both piecewise linear functions P m and 4 k P m are defined over the same compact parameter interval for every m 2 IN and convergence is supposed to be uniform on both sides. <p> The obvious proof is omitted here for shortness and the reader is referred to <ref> [Kob94] </ref>. <p> The restrictions on the coefficients were introduced in order to guarantee symmetry, solvability and affine invariance of the scheme <ref> [Kob94] </ref>. The characteristic function (x) = (1 + 2 ff + 2 fi) cos (4 x) 1 can easily be read off from the coefficient of the implicit condition without further computations.

Reference-contexts: The coefficients of this mask may all be non-vanishing (global dependence) and the mask may change in every refinement step, dependent on the number of points in the polygon to be refined (cf. section 4). Interesting applications of this filter formalism can be found in section 5 or in <ref> [Kob95] </ref> where refinement schemes are defined based on a variational principle, i.e., the new points of the refined polygon are chosen such that some energy functional becomes minimal. 2 2 The discrete Fourier-transform A fundamental tool which is used in this paper is the DFT. <p> This is in contrast to common approaches where the new points usually are given through one or more explicit rules. This class of schemes includes the stationary schemes (fi 2j = ffi j;0 ) as well as the global schemes derived from the variational approach in <ref> [Kob95] </ref> where the implicit definition of the new points naturally arises in terms of a discrete Euler-Lagrange-equation. The resulting linear equation system for computing the new points is set up by separating the known points with even index from the unknowns with odd index in (3). <p> Best results in the convergence analysis by Theorem 9 are achieved if l is taken to its maximum, i.e., (k + l) = 4 for ff 6= 1 20 and (k + l) = 6 for ff = 1 5.2 Variational Schemes In <ref> [Kob95] </ref> refinement schemes are defined as solutions to variational problems. Based on some discrete energy functional, the new points of a refined polygon are chosen such that this energy becomes minimal.

This means: when refining a closed polygon, every new point is computed by applying the same (shifted) cyclic convolution mask.
