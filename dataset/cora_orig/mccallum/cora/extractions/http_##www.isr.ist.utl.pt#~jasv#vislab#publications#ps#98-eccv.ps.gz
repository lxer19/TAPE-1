Title: Solving for Structure, Motion and Calibration, from Uncalibrated Point Matches with  
Author: Maximum-Likelihood-Like Algorithms 
Date: October 30, 1997  
Abstract: We present in this paper, two versions of an algorithm for estimating structure, motion and calibration, from uncalibrated point matches. Contrarily to most current algorithms, it does not solve for an exact solution, searching instead for a maximum-likelihood estimate. It does not use the projective geometry framework, but rather, a simple pinhole-camera model that avoids to intoduce intermediate objects (like e.g. the fundamental matrix). They are optimization algorithms that solve an estimation problem. It was often considered until now that optimization algorithms for solving the considered problem, would converge correctly only if started from "near the solution". Contrary to that idea, some studies have shown that this was not the case, and that algorithms may converge successfuly, even when started from a "trivial" initial positions. We present two such algorithms. We relate our work to the present state-of-the-art, including methods that search for exact solutions, and those that search for Maximum Likelihood solutions. Outside of computer vision, one of our algorithms is related to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that is well-known in the statistics literature.We report numerical results obtained on synthetic data, and detail the experimental protocol. An improvement with respect to previous studies, we report on the "success rate". We also note that calibration estimation is evasive.

Reference-contexts: The later algorithm is inspired on the "Expectation Maximization" (EM) methodology, which is quite well known in the statistical literature. It is defined in <ref> [1] </ref> 1 in a very general setup.The EM has been much studied [19]and has spawned many variants [7][10][11];reviews are available in [12][9].

Before going further, we must discuss intrinsic limitations that any algorithm will meet, as these limitations determin the representation of the reconstruction parameters. A great accomplishment of the algebraic studies e.g.[6], <ref> [2] </ref>, [4],[15] is that they have answered many questions concerning the existence or unicity of solutions of systems of observation equations. We use the following results : The whole calibration and reconstruction problem is known to be solvable when more then three images and 7 points are available. <p> The initial position is : the optical axes are all parallel, aligned with the z-axis. The optical centers are all in the point with world coordinates <ref> [0; 0; 2] </ref>. The reconstructed points are constrained to lie in the z = 0 plane, their coordinates are that of the corresponding pixels in the first image of the sequence, after rescaling to ensure that the mean of kx n k 2 is 1. in Figure 1 (a).

Reference-contexts: are known to be sensitive to noise, and they are most often complemented by an optimization method : the 2 algebraic solution is used as a starting point for an optimization algorithm that will converge to a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate (of the structure and motion and (sometimes) calibration problems) <ref> [4] </ref> [13]. Some other algorithms, like that of Szeliski and Kang [14], and the ones we present, are based solely on solving a problem of ML estimation, using an optimization algorithm : an observation equation is written, (in Subsection2.1) which includes a noise term, whose nature is supposedly known. <p> We write down the likelihood function in Subsection 2.2. All the used optimization algorithms -and ours is no exception- need an "initial guess" to start from. Up to recently <ref> [4] </ref>, it was considered that a "good" initial guess was necessary for the algorithm to converge to the ML estimate, and not to a local minimum very far away from it.

Reference-contexts: These "algebraic" studies have shown some intrinsic limitations faced by any attempt at solving the problem. Most studies are done using the framework of projective geometry, but some work <ref> [5] </ref> has been done by general algebraic methods. Recent studies deal with arbitrary numbers of frames, whereas the earlier ones would consider the problem of stereo.

Reference-contexts: Assuming that point matches are available obviously simplifies the problem, but this sub-problem is in itself often considered an important milestone in solving the full problem.
