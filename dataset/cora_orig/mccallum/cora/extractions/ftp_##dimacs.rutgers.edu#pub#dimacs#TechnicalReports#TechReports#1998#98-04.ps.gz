Reference-contexts: Albertson, Haas <ref> [1] </ref> showed 2 17 30 for cubic graphs (possibly with 1-cuts) and let it open to determine the best possible lower bound. For the Petersen graph we have 2 = 3 5 , and the next theorem shows, that it is the only snark where 2 is that small. <p> Sequence d (G) is called monotonic if d i d i+1 for i = 1; : : : ; 0 1. Albertson and Haas <ref> [1] </ref> gave examples of cubic graphs G where d (G) is non-monotonic. However all these graphs have 1-cuts. Corollary 4.5 There are infinitely many cyclically 5-edge connected cubic graphs with non-monotonic degree sequence. Proof. <p> With this restriction the iterated application of the dot product yields the statement. * The next theorem describes a family of snarks which is already mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 5.2 For each k 1 there is a 3-connected snark H k with r 3 (H k ) = !(H k ) = 2k = 2r 2 (H k ), 3 (H k ) = 25 Proof. Let P denote the Petersen graph.

Reference-contexts: Problem 2.5 Does there exist a function f such that !(G) f (r 3 (G)) for each bridgeless cubic graph G. 3 Maximum 3-Colorable Subgraphs Albertson and Haas <ref> [2] </ref> proved 3 13 15 , and this is a best possible bound because it is achieved by the Petersen graph. However they also mentioned that they do not know an - 8 - infinite family of snarks achieving this bound.

Reference-contexts: All snarks with 10, 12, 14 or 16 vertices have r 3 = 2, and it is easy to see that this also holds true for all snarks on at most 22 vertices having a 2- or 3-edge cut. From the results of <ref> [3] </ref> follows that this is also the case for all cyclically 4-edge connected snarks with girth at least 5 on at most 22 vertices. Assume that H is a minimum snark with r 3 (H) 3 and jV (H)j 22. Then it contains a circuit of length at most 4.

Reference-contexts: Fiorini <ref> [4] </ref> proved that the flower snarks are hypohamiltonian, i.e. J 2k+1 v has a hamil-tonian circuit for each v 2 V (J 2k+1 ), and henceforth they have a hamiltonian path.

Reference-contexts: Johnson [6] proved that the chromatic index of a cubic multigraph (no loops) is either 3 or 4. The latter ones are also called uncolorable graphs while the others are called colorable, cf. <ref> [5] </ref>. We define a snark to be a bridgeless uncolorable graph. This paper deals with parameters measuring their uncolorability. Let G be a graph with maximum vertex degree 3. <p> The flower snarks J 2k+1 are cyclically 6-edge connected if k 3 and were introduced by Isaacs <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The dot product G 1 G 2 of two snarks G 1 ; G 2 was introduced by Isaacs <ref> [5] </ref> and it yields a new snark which is cyclically 4-edge connected and has girth at least 5, if G 1 and G 2 both have these properties.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper considers connected graphs. The chromatic index 0 of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges so that adjacent edges receive different colors. Johnson <ref> [6] </ref> proved that the chromatic index of a cubic multigraph (no loops) is either 3 or 4. The latter ones are also called uncolorable graphs while the others are called colorable, cf. [5]. We define a snark to be a bridgeless uncolorable graph.

Reference-contexts: We close with relating our results to recent results on the edge chromatic difference sequence of cubic graphs. In Section 5 we construct some classes of snarks to which we will refer several times. 2 The Relation Between Resistancy and Oddness We start with generalizing concepts due to Kochol <ref> [7] </ref>. A multipole M = (V; E; S) consists of a set of vertices V = V (M ), a set of edges E = E (M ) and a set of semiedges S = S (M ).

Reference-contexts: We define c 3 (G) := maxfjE (H)jjH is subgraph of G and 0 (H) = 3g, r 3 (G) := jEj c 3 (G) and 3 (G) := c 3 (G) jE (G)j . Parameter r 3 will be called the resistancy of G. (In <ref> [8] </ref>, r 3 (G) is called color number and denoted by c (G). But resistancy seems to be more intuitive.) Obviously, r 3 (G) = 0 and 3 (G) = 1 if and only if G is 3-colorable, and if G is uncolorable, then r 3 (G) 2 (cf. [8]) and <p> (In <ref> [8] </ref>, r 3 (G) is called color number and denoted by c (G). But resistancy seems to be more intuitive.) Obviously, r 3 (G) = 0 and 3 (G) = 1 if and only if G is 3-colorable, and if G is uncolorable, then r 3 (G) 2 (cf. [8]) and 3 (G) &lt; 1. Note that an uncolorable graph is cubic. Throughout this paper the set of colors is K = f0; 1; 2; 3g, and considering a fixed 4-coloring fl of a graph we will always assume that fl 1 (0) is a smallest color class. <p> Let fl be a minimal 4-coloring of a snark and e = vw 2 fl 1 (0), say e 2 A 1 . Then there is path with start vertex v and whose edges are colored 2 and 3 alternately. In <ref> [8] </ref> it is shown that this path ends in w. Hence e is contained in a circuit C e of odd length, and we say that e admits C e . <p> Note that 1 F (0) = A 1 . For any minimum 2-factor F of G we have j 1 F (0)j = !(G) and therefore r 3 (G) !(G). Furthermore it is well known that r 3 (G) = 2 if and only if !(G) = 2, cf. <ref> [8] </ref>. - 2 - In Section 2 we prove that these two parameters can be arbitrarily far apart even in cyclically 5-edge connected snarks. We also show that there is no constant c such that 1 c &lt; 2 and !(G) cr 3 (G) for all snarks G. <p> In Section 3 we consider 3 . An upper bound for 3 is 1, and it cannot be replaced by a smaller number, since for any even number n there is a snark on n vertices r 3 = 2, see Thm. 2.9 <ref> [8] </ref>. We also give new lower bounds for 3 which improve previous known bounds and show that they are best possible. While Section 3 deals with 3-colorable subgraphs of cubic bridgeless graphs, Section 4 deals with 2-colorable subgraphs. Let G be a graph with maximum vertex degree 3. <p> It follows from 2 3 r 3 r 2 1 2 r 3 that r 2 = 2 = 2 3 r 3 for those graphs. The equivalence of r 3 (G) = 2 and !(G) = 2 is well known, cf. <ref> [8] </ref>. Let r 3 (G) = 2. From 2 3 r 3 (G) r 2 (G) &gt; 0 follows r 2 (G) = 1. If r 2 (G) = 1, then r 3 (G) 2r 2 (G) and hence r 3 (G) = 2. <p> Fiorini [4] proved that the flower snarks are hypohamiltonian, i.e. J 2k+1 v has a hamil-tonian circuit for each v 2 V (J 2k+1 ), and henceforth they have a hamiltonian path. In <ref> [8] </ref> it is shown that J 2k+1 v is 3-critical for each v 2 V (J 2k+1 ) and each k 2. - 21 - Theorem 4.4 For each * &gt; 0 and each k 1 there are infinitely many snarks G with 3 (G) &gt; 1 * and 2 (G) <p> We know that H i z i is 3-critical, (cf. Thm 4.3 <ref> [8] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The Hajos-union of H and H 0 is the graph G obtained from H e and H 0 u by adding edges vu 1 and wu 2 . It is well known that G is 3-critical, cf. <ref> [9] </ref> Thm. 4.6. Let P 1 , P 2 , P 3 be copies of the Petersen graph minus a vertex. These graphs are 3-critical, hamiltonian and P i has three divalent vertices u i , v i , w i (i = 1; 2; 3).
