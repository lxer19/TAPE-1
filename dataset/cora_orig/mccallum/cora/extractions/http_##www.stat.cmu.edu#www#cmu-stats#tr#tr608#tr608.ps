Abstract: In this paper we develop a Bayesian approach to data disclosure in survey settings by adopting a probabilistic definition of disclosure due to Dalenius and the principle that a data collection agency must consider disclosure from the perspective of an intruder in order to efficiently evaluate data disclosure limitation procedures. Our approach leads to a formal model involving mixture distributions. We then discuss the implementation of a simplified version of the model which is made computationally feasible by the use of Gibbs sampling in conjunction with several approximations. We apply the methods in a small-scale simulation study using data extracted and adapted from an actual survey conducted by the Institute for Social Research at York University.

Reference-contexts: There is general agreement that, after specific 3 identifiers, geographic information poses one of the greatest risks for disclosure and statis-tical agencies and survey organizations have developed rules on the suppression of detailed geographic information <ref> (Greenberg and Zayatz, 1992) </ref>. Recent work at the Census Bureau attempts to address this analytical concern through the creation of microdata files of "contextual" variables that present reduced disclosure risk (Saalfeld, Zayatz, and Hoel, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Thus a disclosure does not always produce a breach of confidentiality. Our work is guided by the principle that a data collection agency must consider disclosure from the perspective of an intruder in order to efficiently evaluate disclosure limitation procedures <ref> (c.f., Lambert, 1993) </ref>. Others have also studied aspects of intruder behavior, most notably the empirical study by Paass (1988), Blien, Wirth and Muller (1992), Fuller (1993), and Skinner, et al. (1994).

Reference-contexts: Recent work at the Census Bureau attempts to address this analytical concern through the creation of microdata files of "contextual" variables that present reduced disclosure risk <ref> (Saalfeld, Zayatz, and Hoel, 1992) </ref>. There is also considerable agreement that longitudinal information, such as is available from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, makes for easy identification of individual microdata files, but sensible reporting rules for avoiding disclosure are harder to develop for longitudinal records.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the real aim of an organization addressing the issue of confidentiality is the exercise of disclosure control and the acceptability of disclosure risk associated with various kinds of data in different situations <ref> (see the discussion in Skinner et al., 1994) </ref>. There is general agreement that, after specific 3 identifiers, geographic information poses one of the greatest risks for disclosure and statis-tical agencies and survey organizations have developed rules on the suppression of detailed geographic information (Greenberg and Zayatz, 1992).
