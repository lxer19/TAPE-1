Abstract: Expectations about the correlation of cue phrases, the duration of unfilled pauses and the structuring of spoken discourse are framed in light of Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse and are tested for a directions-giving dialogue. The results suggest that cue phrase and discourse structuring tasks may align, and show a correlation for pause length and some of the modifications that speakers can make to discourse structure.

Reference-contexts: They are found within and between the smallest grammatical phrase, the sentence, the utterance, the speaking turn and the discourse segment. Their correlation is mainly with the cognitive difficulty of producing a phrase or utterance <ref> [1] </ref>. To link this correlation with the task of producing discourse structure, we must posit a variety of attentional operations with corresponding variability in cognitive difficulty. <p> In contrast to the propositional and attentional accounts of intonational cues [9], accounts of pausing invoke the demands of cognition and pragmatics. For example, the duration of unfilled pauses has been observed to correlate with the cognitive difficulty involved in producing an utterance <ref> [1] </ref>, while filled pauses may function as a floor holding device [7], or perhaps, correlate with the speaker's emotional response to topic [1]. <p> For example, the duration of unfilled pauses has been observed to correlate with the cognitive difficulty involved in producing an utterance <ref> [1] </ref>, while filled pauses may function as a floor holding device [7], or perhaps, correlate with the speaker's emotional response to topic [1].

To the more specific observations linking cue phrases to attentional state [3, 10] and the duration of unfilled pauses to increased cognitive difficulty <ref> [1] </ref>, I add the assumption of four fundamental focusing operations. Together, they motivate my hypotheses that: (1) Specific cue phrases betoken specific focusing opera tions. (2) Differences in the cognitive difficulty of the focusing operations are reflected in the duration of the pauses that precede them.

Reference-contexts: The attentional state is the third component of the tripartite theory. It models the foci of attention that exist during the construction of intentional structures. The global focus of attention encompasses those entities relevant to the discourse segment currently under construction, while the local focus (also called the center <ref> [2] </ref>) is the currently most salient entity in the discourse segment. The local focus may change from utterance to utterance, while the global focus (i.e., current context) changes only from segment to segment. The linguistic, intentional and attentional components are interrelated.

Reference-contexts: The investigation of the interaction between these cues presupposes a theory of contextual change in discourse. The theory relating attention, intentions and discourse structure <ref> [3] </ref> is particularly useful because it provides a computational account of the current context and the mechanisms of contextual change. This account frames the questions I investigate about the correlation between between lexical and prosodic cues. In particular, the theory motivates the selection of the cue phrase [3] a word or <p> and discourse structure <ref> [3] </ref> is particularly useful because it provides a computational account of the current context and the mechanisms of contextual change. This account frames the questions I investigate about the correlation between between lexical and prosodic cues. In particular, the theory motivates the selection of the cue phrase [3] a word or phrase whose relevance is to structural or rhetorical relations, rather than topic and the unfilled pause (silent pause) as significant indicators of discourse structure. 2. <p> The tripartite nature of discourse To explain the organization of a discourse into topics and subtopics, Grosz and Sidner postulate three interrelated components of discourse a linguistic structure, an intentional structure and an attentional state <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Lexical corroboration may be semantic, from domain specific evidence of topic change or continuation. Or it may be syntactic, from those syntactic distributions that tend not to cross segment boundaries (tense, aspect and the scope of referring expressions <ref> [3] </ref>) 4 Alternatively, prosodic features are likely to better identify the current use of a cue phrase from those that are possible. 6. <p> Questions and predictions My investigation is inspired by the theory relating attentions, intentions and discourse structure <ref> [3] </ref>. To the more specific observations linking cue phrases to attentional state [3, 10] and the duration of unfilled pauses to increased cognitive difficulty [1], I add the assumption of four fundamental focusing operations. <p> Questions and predictions My investigation is inspired by the theory relating attentions, intentions and discourse structure [3].

Their relation to the discourse in which they occur illustrates the difficulty of segmenting in hindsight a discourse whose DSPs may satisfy multiple DPs. This recommends against reliance on domain knowledge, since one discourse may invoke more than one domain.

Reference-contexts: In cases where the usage was unclear, I decided against the pragmatic usage if the phrase in question provided syntactic coordination of two semantically related propositions. If even this judgment proved difficult, I applied the intonational criteria that distinguished cue and non-cue uses of Now <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, if the cue phrase candidate was deaccented, or accented with L* tones or uttered as a complete intonational phrase, it was classified as a cue phrase. 5 The conversation occurred in a face-to-face encounter and was recorded on a hand-held cassette recorder. 9.2.

Reference-contexts: However, while lexical marking of segment boundaries is optional, prosodic marking is not. Thus, at initiation of a discourse segment we find, for example, an expanded pitch range [12] and at its closure, phrase-final lowering <ref> [5] </ref> and syllable lengthening [6]. Sometimes, the same structural cue is implicit for one segment yet explicit for another. For example, in a Replace operation, explicitly marked closure of one segment implicitly permits the initiation of the next.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, its measurement is unambiguous instrumentally and requires less from perception, than, for example, intonational prosodic cues. For, while intonational features are categorical according to their type (combinations of the L, H and * tokens <ref> [8] </ref>) and the structure to which they apply (word, intermediate phrase, intonational phrase), pause duration is ordinal and is measured on the same continuous linear scale for all levels of linguistic and intonational structures. 7.

Reference-contexts: Unfilled pauses and attentional state The most useful prosodic correlates of discourse segmentation occur at segment boundaries and indicate either the opening of a new segment, closure of the old or both.

And expanded pitch range tends to mark the introduction of new 4 For example, Walker and Whittaker observe that deictic pronominal reference may cross segment boundaries, while nondeictic pronominal reference does so only rarely [13]. topics, while reduced pitch range marks subtopics and paren--theticals. <p> Filled pauses (e.g., Um, uh) and unfilled pauses appear at segment boundaries but are also found within a discourse segment and in the smaller groupings it contains.

Similarly, voice quality changes, e.g., from normal to creaky voice, may accompany attentional and intentional changes.
