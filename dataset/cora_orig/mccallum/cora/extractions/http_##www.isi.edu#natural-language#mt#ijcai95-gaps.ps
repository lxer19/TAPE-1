Reference-contexts: This section gives a brief tour of the JAPANGLOSS system. Later sections address questions of knowledge gaps on a module-by-module basis. Our design philosophy has been to chart a middle course between "know-nothing" statistical MT <ref> [ Brown , 1993 ] </ref> and what might be called "know-it-all" knowledge-based MT [ Nirenburg , 1992 ] . Our goal has been to produce an MT system that "knows something" and has a place for each piece of new knowledge, whether it be lexical, grammatical, or conceptual. <p> And our scoring is based on hand-built inherited constraints rather than data. Still, we can view the conceptual knowledge base , in analogy to how our language model assigns probabilities to English strings. This analogy makes it possible to describe KBMT in a statistical framework. Direct statistical MT systems <ref> [ Brown , 1993 ] </ref> use a noisy channel model in which a human is assumed to be speaking English, but the signal is corrupted, and out comes Japanese.
