Abstract: Most computer users undertake some type of searching: in a text editor, with utilities like grep, or with special search systems. We begin with the most powerful string search system that is presently available, PAT (recently renamed OpenText) | studying its use and the underlying algorithms and data structures. Chapter 5 explains these in detail, and a lecture provides clarification. The PAT User's Guide [1] and related exercises allow us to achieve a good working knowledge of the underlying model and its implementation. Common string searching, on the other hand, simply takes a pattern and tries to find match(es) in a target string. Since this is such an important operation, fast algorithms are critical. Chapter 10 surveys the numerous algorithms, considers their strengths and weaknesses, and gives empirical performance data. Practice with the grep family of UNIX commands reinforces these results. Algorithm animations help clarify the operation of the KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms. This Unit has 2 chapters, 2 exercises, 2 lectures, and a session in the laboratory.

Reference-contexts: That and the terse, technical language make them similar to many hard journal articles. The first lecture should help with Chapter 5. The second lecture and the xtango demonstrations should help with Chapter 10. There is good coverage of KMP and Boyer-Moore in <ref> [2] </ref>. 5.1 Textbook Chapter 5 Regarding Chapter 5, there are some specific comments to be made: * p. 67, near middle: Think of the PAT manual when you see discussion of a query language. * p. 68, middle: Remember that the key is to have ordered sistrings. * p. 69, top:
