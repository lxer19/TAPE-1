Abstract: This paper presents an initial overview of our attempts to expand our understanding of autonomous dynamic manipulation. Specifically, it proposes a sample "Dynamical Pick and Place" task and a hierarchical feedback based control strategy for its execution. Included are a sequence of experimental verifications of the underlying behaviors required.

Reference-contexts: The controllers required to carry out these tasks autonomously presently exceed the capability of any robot or programmable mechanism we are aware of (including, of course, our own) and thus present a suitable challenge to the design principles underlying dynamical dexterity that we have developed to date <ref> [20, 2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments show that this is very nearly the case. 3 The Constituent Controllers Following the traditions of Buehler <ref> [4] </ref>, we are interested in programming the robot via "mirror" laws. A mirror law, when properly tracked, guarantees that the state of the robot is strictly a function of the current state of the ball.

Reference-contexts: In the work of Lozano-Perez and colleagues <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, high level progress is made through a sequence of controller actions whose successful termination is ensured via careful choice of compliant motions in the presence of rigid objects. The sequence itself has been designed via a back chaining of motion pre-images. <p> Unfortunately we do not see any "corners" to push against in the dynamic setting beyond those which we can "create" via control policies. Finally there is clearly a need to carefully explore the design of termination predicates that are recognizable as discussed by Donald <ref> [5] </ref> but fit our richer sensor and actuator models. Empirical and Conceptual Background The problems explored here address higher level issues of task execution, but there is still a strong relation to previous work in dextrous manipulation, in particular "robot juggling" performed in our laboratory.

Reference-contexts: For example, we require and are attempting to develop a notion of progress analogous to that introduced by Erdmann for piecewise constant control policies in the quasi-static regime <ref> [7] </ref>, specifically we expect our behaviors to ensure some level of certainty at their termination in much the same way that certainty can be derived by making use of an inaccurate compliant motion to "push" an object into a rigid corner.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally this literature focuses on quasi-static problems (generalized damper dynamics [28] with coulomb reaction forces <ref> [8] </ref> on the contact set). Furthermore, the possible control actions typically are restricted to piecewise constant velocity vectors, each constant piece corrupted by a constant disturbance vector of known (bounded) magnitude and uncertain direction arising from a uniform distribution over the unit ball.

Reference-contexts: Yet the literature continues to study problems in isolation that we wish to study in concert, albeit in greatly simplified form. 3 Pick and Place in Cluttered Environments Our focus on the dynamical pick and place prob-lem is inspired in part by the Handey system developed by Lozano-Perez and colleagues <ref> [9] </ref> who emphasized the importance of developing task planning capabilities suitable for situations where regrasping is necessitated by environmental clutter (however our setup presents dynamical rather than quasi-static regrasping problems).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we never "bother" to develop an explicit disturbance model even though we are specifically interested in operating in the empirical world with all its uncertainties and unmodeled phenomena. On the one hand, the theory and experience of building working controllers <ref> [10, 27] </ref> teaches us that the inevitable small but persistent disturbances arising from modeling errors, sensor inaccuracy and slight miscalibration are countered by the local structural stability properties of stable dynamical systems.

Reference-contexts: Error Detection and Recovery Despite the many dissimilarities in problem domain, models and representation, the work proposed here seems to bear the closest correspondence to the "fine-motion planning with uncertainty" literature in robotics (for example, as expounded in the excellent text of Latombe <ref> [11] </ref>) originated by Lozano-Perez and colleagues [12]. Traditionally this literature focuses on quasi-static problems (generalized damper dynamics [28] with coulomb reaction forces [8] on the contact set).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, our emphasis on robustness and error recovery as the driving consideration in robot task planning derives from their original insights on fine motion planning <ref> [12] </ref> and the subsequent literature in this tradition bears a close relation to our concerns as will be touched upon below. Comprehensive work by Kak and colleagues [26] has yielded a contemporary quasi-static assembly environment in the best traditions of Handey. <p> Error Detection and Recovery Despite the many dissimilarities in problem domain, models and representation, the work proposed here seems to bear the closest correspondence to the "fine-motion planning with uncertainty" literature in robotics (for example, as expounded in the excellent text of Latombe [11]) originated by Lozano-Perez and colleagues <ref> [12] </ref>. Traditionally this literature focuses on quasi-static problems (generalized damper dynamics [28] with coulomb reaction forces [8] on the contact set). <p> Next, we find a behavior whose goal set coincides with the task goal (for now, we assume that this is possible). Using a recursive algorithm similar to preimage backchaining <ref> [12] </ref>, we then set up a partition of the ball's state space governing the behavior selection by moving away from the goal node of the graph in a breadth-first manner and choosing the appropriate subset of the domain of attraction of each controller encountered. 4.1.1 Preparation Graphs and the Partial Ordering <p> The automaton will choose behavior j exactly when the ball state lies within D j . The technique proposed here is a variant of the preimage backchaining idea introduced by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor <ref> [12] </ref>, although their algorithm was used for compliant motion in the face of velocity uncertainty with respect to a generalized damper model of dynamics. We choose to substitute sensory events for the physical transitions that characterized their control sequences.

Reference-contexts: This results in the ball's energy being quickly dissipated while its lateral position is still well regulated 3 .

In this case gains are adjusted such that the hitting portion of the pitch law has been removed.
