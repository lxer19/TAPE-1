Abstract: In a beautiful paper, Sleator, Tarjan and Thurston solved the problem of maximum rotation distance of two binary trees. Equivalently they solved the problem of rotation distance of triangulations on the disk. We extend their results to rotation distance of triangulations of other planar surfaces. We give upper and lower bounds for this problem. Equivalently, by duality, one can interpret our results as bounds for rotation distance of the dual graphs of the triangulation graphs. They are the counter parts to binary trees in the case of disk. In the case of the annulus, by cutting along an edge between the inner and outer boundary circles, we obtain rooted binary trees with a distinguished path to a leaf.

Reference-contexts: In that paper they first transformed the problem on binary trees to a problem on triangulations on the disk, and then applied techniques of topology and geometry to obtain their bounds. Most remarkable is their use of volume estimate in hyperbolic geometry <ref> [1] </ref>, which yielded their tight bounds. No elementary proof is known. It is known that the notion of a rotation can be applied to not only binary trees, but any edge with both vertices of degree 3, as in Figure 1.1 (b). <p> This definition is a bit too restrictive, so we define it instead as a quotient of a periodic triangulation of the strip e A = R fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. An integer n 2 Z acts on e A by right translation by n (if n is negative then this is of course a left translation).

Let f : ST 2 ! H 3 be a continuous, piece-wise smooth map from the solid torus ST 2 to 3-dimensional hyperbolic space H 3 , where a copy of the solid torus g ST 2 is embedded.

We call them exposed triangulations of the annulus. <p> For the upper bound we look at the triangulations in the universal covering space; for the lower bound in the case without winding number, we first prove a theorem of topology, and then argue that non-convexity notwithstanding, the technique of volume estimate of <ref> [5] </ref> is still applicable.

But since our bound is not tight for the leading term, there is little point to pursue it at this point.

Reference-contexts: Such trees with a distinguished path appears to have some applications as fingered trees in data structures <ref> [7] </ref>. By duality, applying edge flips to transform the triangulation is equivalent to applying rotations on the dual graph. Our problem can be stated as determining the maximum rotation distance of the dual graphs.
