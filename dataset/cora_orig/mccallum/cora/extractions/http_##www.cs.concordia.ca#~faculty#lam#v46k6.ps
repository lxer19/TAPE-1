Abstract: In this paper we discuss how to structure a search for a (46; 6; 1) block design. In the incidence matrix of such a design, there must exist a "c4" configuration | 6 rows and 4 columns, in which each pair of columns intersect exactly once, in distinct rows. There can also exist a "c5" configuration - 10 rows and 5 columns, in which each pair of columns intersect exactly once, in distinct rows. Thus the search for (46; 6; 1) designs can be subdivided into two cases, the first of which assumes there is no "c5", and the second of which assumes there is a "c5". We report the results of the search assuming the first case, in which no designs were found. We also give estimates of the time required to complete a computer search assuming the second case.

Note that all that is required for a "c5" to occur is 5 columns and 10 rows in which each pair of columns intersect exactly once.
