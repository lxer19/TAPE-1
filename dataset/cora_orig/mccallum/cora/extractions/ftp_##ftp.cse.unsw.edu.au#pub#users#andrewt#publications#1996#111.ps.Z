Abstract: Border extraction in static two-dimensional echocardiograms (2D echo) using morphological image analysis with second derivative operator performs well. However, with large dropouts and high noise content, this segmentation method will generate false boundary points. By considering temporal information from neighbouring frame, this limitation can be solved. In this paper, we present the improvement of segmentation by adopting dynamic knowledge in our decision process. The results indicate that temporal information greatly reduces the noise sensitivity of the algorithm.
