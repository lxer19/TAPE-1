Abstract: The so called "productivity paradox" associated with information technology remains the focus of active research in information systems. One explanation involves the dearth of useful measures to assess the value of IT investments. A review of the predominant approaches to such measurement reveals a number of serious weaknesses and fundamental limitations. The research described in this paper addresses these limitations through a complementary methodology termed virtual process measurement (VPM). Through VPM, assessments of IT value are determined through the measurement of computer-based process representations (i.e., virtually), as opposed to measuring their real counterparts in ongoing organizations; this approach affords a number of advantages that are unattainable through extant techniques. In this paper, the VPM methodology is discussed in considerable detail, and examples from industry practice are used to demonstrate the use and utility of this approach. The paper closes with a set of conclusions and some possible directions for continued research.

Reference-contexts: This so called "productivity paradox" has been cited in the information systems (IS) literature as a lingering dilemma [4, 22], and represents the focus of current research in academics (e.g., <ref> [1, 14, 26, 46] </ref>). According to one IS journal editor, a key aspect to this dilemma pertains to the manner in which productivity is measured, exacerbated by the lack of good measures for the value of IT [27].

Reference-contexts: These approaches can be found in standard finance textbooks (e.g., [45]), and also include the time-based measures employed in the practice of industrial engineering <ref> [3] </ref>. Use of financial measures requires dollar-denominated measurement of costs and benefits, generally in terms of cost and revenue streams over time. These approaches have the advantage of precision supported by quantitative measures, and their strong theoretical basis supports unambiguous decision rules regarding investment.

Although these measures address SE costs, they do not address the important dimension of benefits; this represents a fundamental limitation of methods in this class.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental limitation of financial measures derives from their (time- and) dollar-denominated, quantitative nature: many important costs and benefits associated with IT 2 investments are qualitative, intangible, and difficult or impossible to measure quantitatively. Such limitation is very well recognized in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) <ref> [36] </ref>, in which powerful symbolic representational techniques are employed to obviate this problem. 2.2 Functional Measures Functional measures were developed in the context of information systems analysis and design, in which the objective was to estimate the complexity of an IS early in the systems development life cycle (SDLC).

Reference-contexts: Additionally, a wide diversity of (good and bad) processes can be examined virtually, without the requirement to physically implement or pilot the process changes in the field organization. Further, because of the time compression enabled by simulation <ref> [40] </ref>, a very large number of alternative process designs can be observed and evaluated in a relatively short period of time (i.e., much shorter than the cycle time required for the process in the field).

Reference-contexts: For example, the concept of the virtual organization <ref> [18, p. 67, 41] </ref> represents computer-supported communication, coordination, and processing sufficient to enable an "organization" of workers to function, without the necessity of collocation or even belonging to a common organizational entity (e.g., firm, department, workgroup); thus the "organization" exists virtually, although its output could be indistinguishable from that of its

Reference-contexts: Second, the handoff fraction measurement of 0.25 indicates that the process is highly-departmentalized; heuristically, this suggests the possibility of employing a case manager [18, p. 36] or case team [5, p. 97] approach, or empowerment can also be instituted to decentralize and accelerate decision making <ref> [43] </ref>. Third, the values for IT-A fraction and IT-C fraction indicate that the IT density of the process is relatively low; heuristically, this suggests that the one or more process activities and communications may be better accomplished with IT support.

Reference-contexts: These approaches can be found in standard finance textbooks (e.g., <ref> [45] </ref>), and also include the time-based measures employed in the practice of industrial engineering [3]. Use of financial measures requires dollar-denominated measurement of costs and benefits, generally in terms of cost and revenue streams over time.

Reference-contexts: This so called "productivity paradox" has been cited in the information systems (IS) literature as a lingering dilemma [4, 22], and represents the focus of current research in academics (e.g., <ref> [1, 14, 26, 46] </ref>). According to one IS journal editor, a key aspect to this dilemma pertains to the manner in which productivity is measured, exacerbated by the lack of good measures for the value of IT [27].

Reference-contexts: Using the A-digraph for process representation affords several key advantages. First, many important qualitative and intangible concepts associated with modeled processes can be represented symbolically, defined with rigor [33], and analyzed through qualitative simulation <ref> [47] </ref>. Additionally, graph theory provides a powerful set of mathematics to support systematic analysis and reliable measurement of organizational processes.

The key argument is that the precise costs and benefits of strategic IS are relatively unimportant, certainly when the IS affords a company the opportunity to dominate a competitive arena, or is required for a firm's survival. <p> A number of consultants begin with the assumption that an IS is indispensable (and, hence, must be developed). Examples include using the competitive forces model [35] to change the nature of competition for a firm (e.g., by raising IT-enabled barriers to entry), or the theory of strategic thrusts <ref> [49] </ref> to outline IT-based means for achieving competitive advantage (e.g., through product differentiation, innovation, or competitive alliance). However, cases like the computerized airline reservation systems [21] suggest that IT-enabled competitive advantages may not be sustainable.

Reference-contexts: One use of improvement attributes would be to represent the time-based derivatives of their dynamic counterparts (e.g., cycle time improvement, cost reduction, risk mitigation). Quantum improvement measures have been employed to gage the degree to which a reengineering proposal is "radical" [18] (e.g., 100 <ref> [50] </ref> can be used to capture an important dimension of organizational learning [9]; additionally, improvement attributes such as process adaptability, flexibility, and repairability provide the opportunity to represent an organization's potential for improvement, deemed to be important in today's competitive environment [42].
