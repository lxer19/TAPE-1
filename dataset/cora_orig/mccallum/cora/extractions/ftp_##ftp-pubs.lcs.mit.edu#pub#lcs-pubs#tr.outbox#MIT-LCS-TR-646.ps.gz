Reference-contexts: have chosen to use the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) as our domain, in large part because there has been a great deal of prior research in this area; it has been selected as the designated common task for evaluation of progress within the ARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) community <ref> [1] </ref>. The specified task is to build and evaluate a system capable of handling continuous and spontaneous speech recognition as well as natural language understanding in the ATIS domain, based on selected tables derived from the online Official Airline Guide (OAG, 1990).

Reference-contexts: However, it should be noted that we have not yet addressed how to incorporate discourse context into our framework. As a consequence, for our initial system we will restrict ourselves to those sentences which can be understood unambiguously out of context (the socalled "Class A" ATIS2 queries <ref> [2] </ref>). In this chapter, we will first briefly describe other approaches that have been used for the ATIS domain. We will then outline in more detail the framework for the IBM approach to the ATIS task, stating clearly where the research of this thesis fits in.

Reference-contexts: Interested groups meet yearly for the ARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshop, where progress is evaluated <ref> [3] </ref>. These groups have considered numerous approaches, bringing to bear speech and natural language techniques which have proven valuable in other applications. As a result, they have been able to demonstrate a query accuracy rate as high as ninety percent. An overview of a few of the various approaches follows.

Reference-contexts: As a result, they have been able to demonstrate a query accuracy rate as high as ninety percent. An overview of a few of the various approaches follows. CMU's spoken language understanding system, Phoenix, and its recent improvements are described in <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. The Phoenix system has separate recognition and parsing stages. The recognizer passes a single word string hypothesis to a frame-based parsing module, which uses semantic grammars to produce a semantic representation of the input utterance.

Reference-contexts: Frames are associated with various types of actions that can be taken by the system. The system is implemented as a top-down Recursive Transition Network chart parser for slots. In MIT's ATIS system <ref> [6] </ref>, a segment-based speech recognition component (SUMMIT) [7] produces a list of the top N sentence hypotheses, which are then filtered by a probabilistic natural language component (TINA) [8]. The recognition component uses a class n-gram language model to provide language constraints.
