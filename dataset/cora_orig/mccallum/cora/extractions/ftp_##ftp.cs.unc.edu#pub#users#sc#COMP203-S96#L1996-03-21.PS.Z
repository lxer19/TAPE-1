Abstract: Many services, such as NFS, window servers and DSM, do not provide threadsafe access. So clients of these services must themselves mutually exclude each other. And the algorithms used in operating system can not be used directly in distributed system, so we must come with a distributed mutual exclusion method. We have server S, critical section CS, process P and Q request the CS. P requests for CS first, and Q requests CS just after P got it. So Q is first put into waiting queue. And then, after P releases the CS, Q gets it. S Q........ Waiting Queue 1. Request CS 5. S grants token after P releases it. 2. Token 6. Release
