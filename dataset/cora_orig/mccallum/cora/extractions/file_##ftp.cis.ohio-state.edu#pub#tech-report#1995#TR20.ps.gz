Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new architecture for wireless FDDI networks and address the issue of providing a real-time communications service in this kind of wireless networks. A wide range of problems concerning synchronous bandwidth management and quality of service guarantee are identified. To solve these problems, we present a dynamic bandwidth management scheme, a source handoff protocol and two approaches to handling destination handoffs. They are able to make handoffs transparent to mobile users so that no quality of service degradation will be observed during handoffs. In the meantime, they also keep the overhead incurred by handoffs small. These solutions are fully compatible with the FDDI standards so that the installation of the wireless base stations implementing them does not require any modification to the existing stations on an FDDI network.

Reference-contexts: One of the services, real-time communications service [7, 12, 19], is of particular importance in today's high speed networks. It can be used to support many applications such as manufacturing systems management, remote monitoring, robotic control, voice and video transmission. In <ref> [1, 2, 21] </ref>, the synchronous transmission capacity of the FDDI networks is shown to be able to support real-time communications service. It is desirable to extend this service to mobile users of wireless FDDI networks. One important application of this extension is robotic communications. <p> Proof. Let t g be the packet generation starting time and t 0 i (i 0) be the token arrivals to transmit these packets. Bandwidth h s allocated by any scheme, such as in <ref> [1, 2, 21] </ref>, ensures that all packets will be transmitted without delay if t 0 If M = 1, t h = t u . According to Theorem 1, we have t u+i+1 &lt; t u+i+1 t u + (i + 2)T T RT h s for any i 0.

Reference-contexts: P i h i T T RT t is so fundamental in the FDDI networks that we shall assume it satisfied throughout the rest of this paper without further mentioning. 2.2 FDDI Synchronous Bandwidth Management The synchronous bandwidth management in an FDDI network is specified by the station management protocol <ref> [4] </ref>. According to this protocol, the bandwidth management is centralized and static. There is at least one synchronous bandwidth management process (BMP) in an FDDI network.

Reference-contexts: It is desirable to extend this service to mobile users of wireless FDDI networks. One important application of this extension is robotic communications. Communications between mobile robots are shown to be able to multiply their capabilities and effectiveness <ref> [5] </ref>. In a manufacturing environment, by providing wireless real-time communications between autonomous robots, the pro-ductivities are expected to increase very much. However, supporting real-time communications in a wireless network is a non-trivial task because a mobile users may move around.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown in [11] that if P i h i T T RT t , each station is guaranteed to see the token at least once in every 2T T RT time. This result is generalized in <ref> [6] </ref> to the following theorem: Theorem 1 If P i h i T T RT t , the time elapsed between any n consecutive token visits to station i is bounded by nTTRT h i .

Reference-contexts: A good wireless system should provide mobile users with all the services that are available to the users attached to the fixed network access points. One of the services, real-time communications service <ref> [7, 12, 19] </ref>, is of particular importance in today's high speed networks. It can be used to support many applications such as manufacturing systems management, remote monitoring, robotic control, voice and video transmission. <p> For the bandwidth allocation, a station cannot increase its amount of allocated synchronous bandwidth until a positive response is received from the BMP. 2.3 Real-Time Channels The concept of real-time channel is first proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. It is a simplex virtual connection with the quality of service (QOS) guarantee. Before a channel is set up, the user provides the specification of traffic characteristics as well as the QOS requirements.

Reference-contexts: According to <ref> [9] </ref>, there are three types of handoffs: hard handoffs, seamless handoffs, and soft handoffs. For a hard handoff, the MS involved has to change its wireless channel within a very short interval, maybe only a single time point.

Reference-contexts: Another type of metropolitan area networks, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks, are currently widely deployed. According to a survey, in terms of units, FDDI networks' growth rate is 80% in 1993 and will be close to 100% in 1994 and 1995 <ref> [10] </ref>. Therefore, it is of great practical value for us to study an architecture based on the FDDI networks. As a rational first step toward large scale deployment of wireless systems [13], we concentrate on a wireless system based on one FDDI network in this paper. <p> Otherwise, it is not allowed to send asynchronous data.

Reference-contexts: Its infrastructure is DQDB metropolitan area network (IEEE 802.6), which are used to connect the wireless interfaces.

Although that architecture is very good for establishing wireless services in an area where a DQDB network already exists or will be installed, it is not quite suitable in the situations when other types of wired networks are already deployed in the intended area.

Reference-contexts: For a seamless or soft handoff, the MS can simultaneously connect with two base stations using two wireless channels for a period of time. This period of time is called degradation interval and can last as long as several seconds <ref> [18] </ref>. Soft handoffs are employed in the U.S. CDMA standard (IS-92) and considered in the European UMTS standard. They are expected to be popular in the future wireless systems. So in this paper, we mainly discuss soft handoffs. The layout of our architecture is depicted in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we have not addressed the problem of how to reduce the overhead bandwidth to an amount less than the originally allocated bandwidth. This issue is under investigation now and some preliminary results are encouraging <ref> [20] </ref>. Another problem is that we only study the wireless system based on one FDDI network, which is limited in deployment scale. Further research on a wireless system based on multiple FDDI networks should be conducted.

Reference-contexts: One of the services, real-time communications service [7, 12, 19], is of particular importance in today's high speed networks. It can be used to support many applications such as manufacturing systems management, remote monitoring, robotic control, voice and video transmission. In <ref> [1, 2, 21] </ref>, the synchronous transmission capacity of the FDDI networks is shown to be able to support real-time communications service. It is desirable to extend this service to mobile users of wireless FDDI networks. One important application of this extension is robotic communications. <p> The networks may accept or reject the channel by testing whether its requirements can be satisfied under the current load. Once the channel is accepted, its QOS requirements will be guaranteed if the traffic generated by the user does not violate the specification. This concept is further extended in <ref> [21] </ref> to the FDDI network by the following definition. <p> The feasibility of a real-time channel depends on the values of h, T T RT and their relations to T , C, and d. Given T T RT , T , C, and d, a scheme was provided in <ref> [21] </ref> to calculate the minimum bandwidth required for a real-time channel to be feasible. 5 3 Wireless FDDI Networks As mentioned in the introduction, this paper addresses a wireless system based on an FDDI network and the pertaining wireless services. <p> Proof. Let t g be the packet generation starting time and t 0 i (i 0) be the token arrivals to transmit these packets. Bandwidth h s allocated by any scheme, such as in <ref> [1, 2, 21] </ref>, ensures that all packets will be transmitted without delay if t 0 If M = 1, t h = t u . According to Theorem 1, we have t u+i+1 &lt; t u+i+1 t u + (i + 2)T T RT h s for any i 0. <p> It is easy to see M 0 2. According to Definition 4, all token visits between LCT (t h ) and t u (not including them) use up bandwidth h s and all data transmitted by these token visits are generated after LCT (t h ). According to <ref> [21] </ref>, to satisfy the throughput requirement, h s should be no less than (T T RT =T )C.
