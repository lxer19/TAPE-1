Abstract: Corporate network firewalls are well-understood and are becoming commonplace. These firewalls establish a security perimeter that aims to block (or heavily restrict) both incoming and outgoing network communication. We argue that these firewalls are neither effective nor appropriate for academic or corporate research environments needing to maintain information security while still supporting the free exchange of ideas. In this paper, we present the Stanford University Research Firewall (SURF), a network firewall design that is suitable for a research environment. While still protecting information and computing resources behind the firewall, this firewall is less restrictive of outward information flow than the traditional model; can be easily deployed; and can give internal users the illusion of unrestricted e-mail, anonymous FTP, and WWW connectivity to the greater Internet. Our experience demonstrates that an adequate firewall for a research environment can be constructed for minimal cost using off-the-shelf software and hardware components.

Reference-contexts: UDP applications receiving a request packet on a client port must treat the packet as an invalid protocol operation. Of course, the final approach to re-designing UDP protocols is to discard UDP in favor of an explicit transaction-oriented protocol. Either VMTP [2] or transactional TCP <ref> [1] </ref> would allow exact request-response filtering. VMTP has an explicit request-response bit in the header, while with transactional TCP, we can again apply TCP SYN filtering.

Reference-contexts: For each authorized user on the internal system, it checks for mail in the external server's spool directory. E-mail for those users is appended to their internal spool files, and an appropriately formated Received line <ref> [12] </ref> is added to the mail header to reflect the transfer. Biff is notified of each delivered message. To the user, therefore, internal and external mail are indistinguishable, even though they are initially processed by sendmail processes running on different machines.

Reference-contexts: Different applications can use the same multicast address simultaneously without restriction.

This distributed whiteboard is a peer-to-peer application in which each participant subscribes to, and transmits on, a single multicast address.

Reference-contexts: Although many corporations desire more open access to the Internet, they limit Internet access and the sacrifice such services as personal World-Wide-Web pages to achieve corporate security. Even recent firewall designs which attempt to relax some of these limitations <ref> [14] </ref> only support specific interactions between sites located within a single authentication domain or private network. Academic institutions also face concerns about the security of computing resources and information.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Growth of the Internet has increased awareness of the need for security to prevent destruction of data by an intruder, maintain the privacy of local information, and prevent unauthorized use of computing resources <ref> [15] </ref>. Indeed, analysts estimate that 50% of large corporations have seen a computer break-in over the past year [27]. Corporations are concerned with preventing unauthorized leakage of corporate intellectual property.

Reference-contexts: The need for remote login access is not unique to our firewall. Many mechanisms are in widespread use. We provide two remote login services: S/Key and Kerberos. S/Key <ref> [16] </ref> generates a set of one-time passwords enabling the remote user to log onto a bastion from anywhere. The keys are provided by interacting with the S/Key server over a secure channel (local or Kerberos-encrypted telnet).

Reference-contexts: The same packet could equally well be an SNMP response from A, to a client coincidentally running at port 53 on B, which is not running a DNS server.

Reference-contexts: To connect two isolated sites that are protected and mutually trusting, we establish a secure IP tunnel between them. Arbitrary IP packets are then encapsulated and tunnelled between the two sites. We chose to use Ioannidis' swIPe protocol <ref> [18] </ref> to implement an authenticated, encrypted IP tunnel. The endpoints of the tunnel are known, and the filter ensures that incoming swIPe packets are actually part of an already registered tunnel.

Reference-contexts: Our access policy does not allow this connection, however. We could choose to let the connection through the firewall and rely on the X server to reject unauthorized connections. Unfortunately, authentication systems such as Kerberos <ref> [23, 19] </ref> are not deployed on all potential external client machines. Without a convenient, unobtrusive, and ubiquitous authentication mechanism, we believe the temptation to disable server authentication is too great. At this point, we have not fully assessed the implications of allowing arbitrary client connections to reach internal X servers. <p> Because the conversation is not likely to be encrypted, we do not consider it completely trustworthy. In particular, users of unencrypted S/Key must assume that their passwords are compromised when typed over an insecure network. Encrypted Kerberos connections <ref> [23, 19] </ref> are more secure and, therefore, can permit greater functionality. Ker-beros is used to authenticate the remote user, and encryption is used to keep the connection secure. The Kerberos password is never typed over the network in the clear; so it is not compromised.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, our TCP approach of a packet filter and host filtering is impractical for connectionless UDP protocols. Two connectionless UDP services that we regard as essential are NTP <ref> [20] </ref> for time synchronization, and DNS [21] for mapping between hostnames and addresses. NTP servers are configured in a tree; higher-level servers periodically broadcast their current time statistics to lower-level servers, so the lower-level servers can measure and adjust for clock drift.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Magic Carpet delivers mail for users of the form LOG-foo on the expendable server to a logfile foo inside the firewall. Our design for electronic mail processing offers two significant advantages over alternatives such as Post Office Protocol (POP) <ref> [22] </ref>. First, except for a slight delay in arrival of mail from outside the firewall, local and remote delivery is transparent to users. Moreover, standard mechanisms for mail forwarding, aliases, and logging are naturally extended to the firewall environment.

Reference-contexts: The back-channel problem arises in a different form when a user inside the firewall tries to start an X windows <ref> [24] </ref> client on an external host to appear on the user's local display. To connect to the display, the external client must establish a TCP connection to the X server inside the firewall. Our access policy does not allow this connection, however.

Reference-contexts: We treat such protocols much like TCP connections by deploying a heuristic filter (based on source and destination addresses and port numbers and packet contents) and trusting internal hosts to further filter inappropriate responses. 3 NFS-client filtering at hosts: NFS [26] is a request--response protocol: the NFS client sends RPC <ref> [25] </ref> requests to the NFS server, and the server returns the results. The request-response rule of our security policy implies that NFS clients protected by our firewall should be permitted to NFS-mount filesystems from NFS-servers outside our firewall if group members behind the firewall choose to do so.
