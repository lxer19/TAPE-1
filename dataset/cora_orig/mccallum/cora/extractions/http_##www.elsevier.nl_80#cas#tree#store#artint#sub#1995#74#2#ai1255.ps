Abstract: Sloman's view largely reverses the usual view of Godel's sentence. But Sloman does not have good arguments for his basic theses: that the Godel sentence does not mean what it is commonly taken to mean, and that we can't say that it is true in the intended model. The reason for Sloman's reversal of perspective is his high-level point of view, from which relevant levels of structure in the formal system, its Godel sentence and its models are not visible.

Reference-contexts: The argument would then be that pr (G) entails G, but it does not do so: the implication pr (G) ! G is not provable, because the implication pr (p) ! p is provable only for provable sentences p. This is a statement of Lob's theorem <ref> [1, p. 187] </ref>, which is equivalent to Godel's second theorem; the implication pr (p) ! p is called the principle of reflection (of the meta-theory in the theory). <p> Such models are of course non-standard in the descriptive sense of the word, but not in its technical sense. Non-standard models do not change but, on the contrary, preserve the truth-values of statements in the standard model, although they are not isomorphic to it [3, p. 203], <ref> [1, p. 193] </ref>. So, in non-standard models of F , G (F ) is actually (still) true. 3. <p> Models of natural numbers can be multiple if they are isomorphic, and even if they are not, provided they are non-standard in the standard sense of the term. Literally speaking, ambiguity is unavoidable since no satisfiable set of sentences has exactly one model <ref> [1, p. 191] </ref>. Sloman is also concerned with the ambiguity between standard and (what he calls) non-standard models of F , in which G (F ) is false. <p> However, such numbers appear already in non-standard models proper, those which are not isomorphic to the standard one but nevertheless preserve the truth-values of all statements <ref> [1, p. 195] </ref>. Thus, our concept of the intended model and those which are much less or even not intended is better than Sloman thinks, and does not have the weakness which he thinks it has ("too many models").

Reference-contexts: The nature of those models of F in which G (F ) is false is already clear from <ref> [2] </ref>, to which Sloman refers, where Hofstadter discusses the possibility of extending F with the negation of G (F ) [2, pp. 452-456]. This possibility is better understood if the deductive structure of F and the logical form of G (F ) are seen in some more D. <p> The nature of those models of F in which G (F ) is false is already clear from [2], to which Sloman refers, where Hofstadter discusses the possibility of extending F with the negation of G (F ) <ref> [2, pp. 452-456] </ref>.

Conclusion Sloman's theses that the Godel sentence does not mean what it seems to mean and that we can't say that it is true in the intended model are misguided.

Reference-contexts: Such models are of course non-standard in the descriptive sense of the word, but not in its technical sense. Non-standard models do not change but, on the contrary, preserve the truth-values of statements in the standard model, although they are not isomorphic to it <ref> [3, p. 203] </ref>, [1, p. 193]. So, in non-standard models of F , G (F ) is actually (still) true. 3.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In his review [6] of Penrose's view of Godel's theorems <ref> [4] </ref>, Sloman argues that the Godel sentence does not mean what it seems to mean and that we can't say that it is true in the intended model.

Reference-contexts: These instances are thus true in the domain of natural numbers, which means that the general statement G (F ) is also true in it <ref> [5, p. 115] </ref>. But Sloman is not satisfied with such a proof, and does not accept Penrose's more informal "seeing" that G (F ) is true because what it says (that it is not provable) is so (if F is consistent).

Reference-contexts: This variant, and the intermediate one according to which the meta-arithmetical meaning is the primary one, would make G (F ) paradoxical and actually prevent the proof of Godel's theorem, as Varga notes, citing Kutchera <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is worth doing because Sloman's view tends to invert the usual view of Godel's sentence. For another kind of interesting misconception of Godel's sentence, its supposed concealment of an infinite regress, see <ref> [8] </ref>. Sloman's view of Godel's sentence might be summarized like this: we think it's true, because we think it means something in the meta-language, but it doesn't, because it's not always true. The following is a more detailed analysis of Sloman's position. fl Fax: +386 61/1258-058.
