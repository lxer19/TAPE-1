Abstract: This paper presents a four-faceted framework for distributed applications that use worldwide networks connecting large numbers of people, software tools, monitoring instruments, and control devices. We describe a class of applications, identify requirements for a framework that supports these applications, and propose a design fulfilling those requirements. We discuss some initial experiences using the framework, and compare our design with other approaches.

Reference-contexts: Hector is a Python-based distributed object framework that provides a communications transparency layer enabling negotiation of communication 10 protocol qualities, comprehensive support services for application objects, and a four-tiered archi-tecture for interaction <ref> [1] </ref>. Aglets provide a Java-based framework for secure Internet agents that are mobile, moving state along with the program components themselves [13]. We differ from these efforts because our emphasis is on reasoning about global compositional distributed systems. Concurrency Frameworks.

Reference-contexts: We chose this model for its simplicity <ref> [3] </ref>. A personal network consists of an arrangement of processes and a set of directed, typed, secure communication channels connecting process output ports to the input ports of other processes; its topology can be represented by a labeled directed graph.

Reference-contexts: Because no valid references to their mailboxes exist, frozen processes cannot participate in sessions. 3.3 Conceptual Model: Sessions Operationally, a session is a task carried out by (the processes in) a personal network <ref> [4] </ref>. It is initiated by a process in the personal network, and is completed when the task has been accomplished. A later session may use the same processes to carry out another task. <p> Moreover, the same process may participate concurrently in sessions initiated by different consortia or task forces. For example, a calendar manager may participate concurrently in sessions determining meeting times for a scout troop and a conference program committee. Our framework allows processes to participate in concurrent sessions <ref> [4] </ref>. A resource may be requested by a session in either exclusive mode or nonexclusive mode. For example, a visualization engine may need to be in exclusive mode for a task: while the task is executing, no other task can access it.

Reference-contexts: Concurrency Frameworks. We have considered several previous approaches to concurrent communicating processes in developing our framework. The Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model assumes each process is active for the entire duration of the computation [11]. Like Fortran M <ref> [5] </ref>, we implement this model, adding such implementation artifacts as dealing with process setup and removal, and permitting prioritized waits to resolve resource contention.

Reference-contexts: A session can negotiate with the underlying communication layer to use the most appropriate process-to-process mechanism. The current framework supports only UDP, but we plan in future releases to support a range of protocols such as TCP and communication layers such as Globus <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Structuring Mechanisms Personal networks and sessions can be used not only as structuring mechanisms, but also for reasoning about the services provided to distributed systems. 6 4.1 Reasoning About Sessions Consider a consortium of institutions working together on a research project. <p> In this sense, our framework is comparable to other metacomputing, component, and concurrency frameworks. Metacomputing Frameworks. Our framework efforts are similar to recent metacomputing endeavors in that we use the Internet as a resource for concurrent computations. Globus provides the infrastructure to create networked virtual supercomputers for running applications <ref> [6] </ref>. Similarly, NPAC at Syracuse seeks to perform High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) activities using a Web-enabled concurrent virtual machine [7]. Javelin is a Java-based architecture for writing parallel programs, implemented over Internet hosts, clients, and brokers [2].

Reference-contexts: The students were given a week to design, reason about, and implement their poker-playing processes; we spent approximately the same amount of time specifying those processes and their interactions. In both these cases, patterns helped the programmers develop their code quickly. Patterns encapsulate software solutions to common problems <ref> [8] </ref>, and our framework has incorporated some applications of concurrency patterns in Java [14]. Initial experience with our framework has suggested several other patterns, both for collaborations between processes and for state-transition systems. Collaboration Patterns. Several patterns of collaboration network topologies have emerged from our exploration of personal networks.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, one service our framework should provide is the acquisition of locks on distributed objects accessed during a session.

Presently, our framework provides only an exclusive lock on an object, but the framework can be extended to include other types of locks, such as read and write locks. Deadlock Avoidance. If sessions lock objects in an incremental fashion, deadlock can occur.

Infospheres are discussed in our framework user's guide <ref> [12] </ref>. This paper focuses on the conceptual models for processes, personal networks, and sessions. 3 3.1 Conceptual Model: Processes Processes are the persistent communicating objects that manage devices and interfaces. In our framework, we call these processes djinns. Process States. A given process can be in one of three states.

Reference-contexts: This persistence model is similar to mechanisms provided as recent ORB services [21]. However, the CORBA process model, implemented using the Basic Object Adaptor (BOA) of a given Object Request Broker (ORB), maintains that only the broker stay active for the entire duration of the computation <ref> [16] </ref>. Like Client-Server, Remote Procedure Call, and Remote Method Invocation systems, CORBA only spawns remote processes to perform isolated remote tasks.

Reference-contexts: If the communication layer cannot deliver a message, an exception is raised in the sender containing the message, destination inbox, and specific error condition. Our system uses a sliding window protocol <ref> [17] </ref> to manage the messages in transit. Every message at the head of an outbox will eventually be handled by the communication layer. The conceptual model uses asynchronous messages rather than remote procedure calls, to be tolerant of the range of message delays experienced along different links of the Internet.

Reference-contexts: an income transfer may require different actions based on how much money is being transferred, for tax shelter purposes. 6 Framework Implementation Version 1.0 of our tools and models, released in February 1997, is classified in the "white box framework" level of the taxonomy given by the framework pattern language <ref> [18] </ref>. With the addition of more applications, services, visual builders, and language tools, we are developing a "black box framework." To guarantee widespread, unrestricted use, our framework has been developed using Sun's Java Developer's Kit (JDK) 1.0.2. <p> * Security packages for communication encryption and process authentication. * Reflection packages for innovative structuring of emergent personal networks and process behavior. 7 Related Work Frameworks are reusable designs for software system processes, described by the combination of a set of objects and the way those objects can be used <ref> [18] </ref>. Our framework consists of some middleware APIs, a model for using them, and services and patterns that are helpful not only in inheriting from objects, but extending them as well. These features allow the reuse of both design and code, reducing the effort required to develop an application.

Reference-contexts: Component Frameworks. Many other framework systems also have the goal of creating distributed system components.

Reference-contexts: Personal networks can also be used by institutions and businesses to create task forces to handle short-term situations. The structure of personal networks comprises the organizational, informational, and workflow structures of the corresponding task force. Workflow describes the manner in which jobs are processed in stages by different processes <ref> [22] </ref>. One example of a task force is a panel that reviews proposals submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF). Panel members come from a variety of institutions, and the panel has an organizational structure with a general chair, subcommittees, primary reviewers, and secondary reviewers.
