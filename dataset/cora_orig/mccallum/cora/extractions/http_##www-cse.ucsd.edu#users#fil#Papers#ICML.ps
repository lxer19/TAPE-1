Title: ARACHNID: Adaptive Retrieval Agents Choosing Heuristic Neighborhoods for Information Discovery

Abstract: ARACHNID is a distributed algorithm for information discovery in large, dynamic, distributed environments such as the World Wide Web. The approach is based on a distributed, adaptive population of intelligent agents making local decisions. The behavior of the algorithm is analyzed using a simplified model of the Web environment. This analysis highlights an interesting feature of the Web environment that bodes well for ARACHNID's search methods. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using both simulated environments and preliminary experiments in which prototype agents search real Web environments. Interactions are also discussed between unsupervised learning by individual agents and evolution at the population level, along with the role played in both by user relevance feedback.

Reference-contexts: Several machine learning techniques have been suggested to produce effective information agents, yielding for example agents that perform look-ahead searches and provide suggestions to the user on the basis of reinforcement learning <ref> (Armstrong et al. 1995) </ref>. Techniques such as weighted keyword vector representations and relevance feedback, in conjunction with genetic algorithms and/or paradigms inspired by artificial life, have been applied to information retrieval and filtering (Sheth and Maes 1993; Kraft et al. 1995; Balabanovic and Shoham 1995; Moukas 1996).

Reference-contexts: Work is under way to achieve a better theoretical analysis of the algorithm, allowing one to predict its behavior under wider environmental conditions, and accounting for interactions among agents <ref> (Carson and Impagliazzo 1997) </ref>. Furthermore, more data must be collected before one can become reasonably confident that the R &gt; G conjecture holds in real environments. The naive representation allows for only limited adaptation |namely, adjusting how much agents trust link estimates and user feedback.

Reference-contexts: Agents employ information retrieval tools such as a filter for noise words and a stemmer based on Porter's <ref> (Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992) </ref>. An efficient representation of visited documents is stored in a shared cache. Some very preliminary experiments have been performed using these ARACHNID prototypes. Evaluation is a main problem in the Web due to the difficulty of collecting relevance assessments.

Reference-contexts: This unimodal behavior is not the most appropriate in the information discovery domain, where as many relevant documents as possible need be retrieved, rather than just the most relevant one. Techniques dealing with multimodal optimization problems, such as fitness sharing <ref> (Horn 1996) </ref>, have been suggested in the genetic algorithms literature, but they are not efficient in distributed environments because they still require global operations (Mahfoud 1995). The approach proposed here employs a genetic algorithm based on local selection.

Reference-contexts: But over a wide range of reasonable parameterizations, the ARACHNID algorithm is well-behaved. Bibliometric studies suggest that the Web environment possesses a well-structured semantic topology <ref> (Larson 1996) </ref>. This observation bodes well for the ARACHNID approach. The semantic topology conjecture can also be tested directly; if R &gt; G, ARACHNID should outperform random search under the assumptions above. Realistic estimates of R (G) can only be determined by gathering statistics from the actual Web.

Reference-contexts: is a variation of the "term frequency-inverse document frequency" index weighting scheme, using algebraic term frequencies. relevance feedback: I k = ! k 1 + log 1 C k = fraction of cache documents containing k Learning (6) This representation lends itself naturally to learning by way of connectionist Q-learning <ref> (Lin 1992) </ref>. After an agent visits document D, r (D) is used as the reinforcement signal. The agent's network weights are adjusted by back-propagation of error, us ing teaching input: r (D) + max f l g where is a discount factor.

Reference-contexts: Autonomous agents, or semi-intelligent programs making automatic decisions on behalf of the user, are viewed by many as a way of decreasing the amount of human-computer interaction necessary to manage the increasing amount of information available online <ref> (Maes 1994) </ref>. Several machine learning techniques have been suggested to produce effective information agents, yielding for example agents that perform look-ahead searches and provide suggestions to the user on the basis of reinforcement learning (Armstrong et al. 1995).

Reference-contexts: All the system can do is analyze document text and follow hyperlinks between documents. I introduce a simple algorithm, inspired by prior work on agents adapting in environments sharing many characteristics with the Web <ref> (Menczer and Belew 1996a, 1996b) </ref>, and analyze its efficiency in an abstracted model of the Web.

Reference-contexts: Rather, some measure of fitness (energy) is accumulated over time; selection occurs in a distributed fashion, comparing energy with a fixed threshold. This selection scheme is inspired by artificial life models with endogenous fitness <ref> (Menczer and Belew 1996b) </ref>. The result is the same type of non-converging behavior required for multimodal optimization, and therefore local selection is appropriate for the information discovery problem.

Reference-contexts: Such approaches have led to multi-agent information systems where both population-based evolution and individual-based learning occur. We have proposed the application of these machine learning methods to the problem of information discovery <ref> (Menczer et al. 1995) </ref>. Traditional genetic algorithms use selection schemes in which some global operation (e.g., ranking or averaging) is performed on the fitness of the population to decide which genotypes get to reproduce. As a result, the population typically converges to some solution, hopefully the optimum.
