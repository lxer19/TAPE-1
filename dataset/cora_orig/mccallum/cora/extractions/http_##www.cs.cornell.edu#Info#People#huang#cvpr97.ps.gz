Abstract: We define a new image feature called the color correlo-gram and use it for image indexing and comparison. This feature distills the spatial correlation of colors, and is both effective and inexpensive for content-based image retrieval. The correlogram robustly tolerates large changes in appearance and shape caused by changes in viewing positions, camera zooms, etc. Experimental evidence suggests that this new feature outperforms not only the traditional color histogram method but also the recently proposed histogram refinement methods for image indexing/retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The correlogram is powerful and needs to be explored in further detail. One practical question is, can the correlogram be compressed with only a minor loss in quality? It will also be interesting to study the use of correlograms for target search and open-ended browsing of image databases <ref> [2] </ref>. Some of our results show that when there is a large lighting change between a query and its correct answer, autocor-relograms rank the answer within the top 15 (in these cases, the histogram and CCV/C fail).

Reference-contexts: The L 1 and L 2 distance measures are commonly used when comparing two feature vectors. In practice, the L 1 distance measure performs better than the L 2 distance measure because the former is statistically more robust to outliers [11]. Hafner et al. <ref> [4] </ref> suggest using a more sophisticated quadratic form of distance measure, which tries to capture the perceptual similarity between any two colors. To avoid intensive computation of quadratic functions, they propose to use low-dimensional color features as filters before using the quadratic form for the distance measure. <p> This sparsity could be exploited to cut down storage and speed up computations. Filtering. A good balance between effectiveness and efficiency can be obtained by adopting a two-pass approach <ref> [4] </ref>. First, we retrieve a set of N images using an inexpensive search algorithm; next, a more sophisticated matching technique is used to compare only these images to the query.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithms are amenable to easy parallelization. Thus, the computation of the correlogram could be enormously speeded up. First, to compute the correlogram, it suffices to compute the following count (similar to the cooccurrence matrix defined in <ref> [5] </ref> for texture analysis of gray images) G (k) D fi fi for, fl c i ;c j (I) = G c i ;c j (I)=(h c i (I) 8k).

Reference-contexts: We could therefore replace the expression jh c i (I) h c i (I 0 )j in Equation 8 by jh c i (I) h c i (I 0 )j (10) (the 1 in the denominator prevents division by zero). This intuition has theoretical justification in <ref> [6] </ref> which suggests that sometimes, a relative measure of distance d is better.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the histogram is not robust to large appearance changes.

The use of overlapping regions makes the feature vectors relatively insensitive to small rotations or translations. Pass and Zabih <ref> [8] </ref> use another approach. They partition histogram bins by the spatial coherence of pixels. A pixel is coherent if it is a part of some sizable similar-colored region, and incoherent otherwise. A color coherence vector (CCV) represents this classification for each color in the image. <p> A color coherence vector (CCV) represents this classification for each color in the image. CCVs are fast to compute and appear to perform better than histograms. The notion of CCV is also extended in <ref> [8] </ref>, by using additional feature (s) to further refine the CCV-refined histogram. One such extension uses the center of the image (the centermost 75% of the pixels are defined as the center) as the additional feature. <p> In the four cases where color histograms perform better, the average improvement is just two positions. Autocorrelograms, however, still rank the correct answers within top six in these cases. We adopt the approach used in <ref> [8] </ref> to analyze the statistical significance of the improvements. We formulate the null hypothesis H 0 which states that the autocorrelogram method is as likely to cause a negative change in rank as a non-negative one.

Our Approach. <p> One common approach is to divide images into subregions and impose positional constraints on the image comparison (image partitioning). Another approach is to augment histograms with local spatial properties (histogram refinement). Smith and Chang <ref> [12] </ref> partition an image into binary color sets. They first select all colors that are sufficiently present in a region. The colors for a region are represented by a binary color set that is computed using histogram back-projection [14]. The binary color sets and their location information constitute the feature. <p> Now, the recall r is defined for a scope, to be s &gt; 0 as jfQ 0 i j rank (Q 0 i ) sgj=a. This measure is simpler than the traditional recall vs. precision but still evaluates the effectiveness of the retrieval <ref> [12] </ref>. 5. Experimental Methodology 5.1. Efficiency Considerations As image databases grow in size, retrieval systems need to address efficiency issues in addition to the issue of retrieval effectiveness. We investigate several general methods to improve the efficiency of indexing and searching, without compromising effectiveness. Parallelization.
