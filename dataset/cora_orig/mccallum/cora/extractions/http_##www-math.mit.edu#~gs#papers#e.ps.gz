Abstract: This paper is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of (# 2)H. The ordinary FIR filter H is convolution with a vector h = (h(0); : : : ; h(N )), the impulse response. The operator (# 2) downsamples the output y = h fl x, keeping the even-numbered components y(2n). Where H is represented by a constant-diagonal matrix | this is a Toeplitz matrix with h(k) on its kth diagonal | the odd-numbered rows are removed in (# 2)H. The result is a double shift between rows, yielding a block Toeplitz matrix with 1 fi 2 blocks. h(k)z k has a zero of order p at z = 1, corresponding to ! = , then (# 2)H has p special eigenvalues 1 2 ; 1 1 p . We show how each additional "zero at " divides all eigenval ues by 2 and creates a new eigenvector for = 1 2 . This eigenvector solves the dilation equation (t) = 2 response 2H(z)H(z 1 ). We find a simple proof of the necessary and sufficient condition for convergence. SP-8030 Key words: wavelets, cascade algorithm, scaling function 1

Reference-contexts: The shift becomes 2 i after i iterations, so convergence is the same from both starting boxes. A smoother start, when (0) (t) is the hat function on [0; 2], will give smoother convergence. But not all initial functions are admissible. A referee observed that the hat function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, piecewise linear with (0) ( 1 2 ) = 2, becomes a double hat after one Haar iteration: (0) (2t) + (0) (2t 1) is linear between 0; 2; 0; 2; 0 at t = 0; 1 ; 2 3 ; 1: Each cascade step scales t by 2

Reference-contexts: (t) = P 2h (k) (i) (2t k) converges in L 2 for all (0) in I if and only if the eigenvalues of T satisfy Condition E: = 1 is a simple eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues have jj &lt; 1: (5) Condition E is also the Cohen-Daubechies requirement <ref> [2] </ref> for the translates (t k) to be strongly independent. Jia [10] has studied convergence and independence very carefully also in L p . <p> Note that the shifted box (0) (t 1) = [1;2] has the same convergence properties. The shift becomes 2 i after i iterations, so convergence is the same from both starting boxes. A smoother start, when (0) (t) is the hat function on <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, will give smoother convergence. But not all initial functions are admissible. <p> The component a (i) (0) is the energy fl fl (i) (t) fl 2 , and the step to a (i+1) (0) has been analyzed by Eirola [8], Villemoes [18], Cohen-Daubechies <ref> [2] </ref>, and Herve [9]. Lemmas 1 and 2 show that the matrix T controls the evolution of all inner products. Then Theorem 4 will establish "Condition E" for convergence. <p> The norm of T is sup fi fi 2 fi fi 2 = 1. Condition E reduces to the Cohen-Lawton condition <ref> [2] </ref>, [11] that = 1 is a simple eigenvalue of T . Then f (t + k)g is an orthonormal basis. Note 4 If all eigenvalues of T with jj = 1 are nondefective, the powers T i remain bounded. Then the vectors a (i) are bounded. S. L.

The limit function (t) is the unique solution <ref> [6] </ref> to the dilation equation, normalized by R (t)dt = 1. Therefore the inner product vectors a (i) for (i) (t) converge to the inner product vector a for (t), and T a = a. We now prove that Condition E must hold for the matrix T .

Reference-contexts: This conforms to the rule that the left eigenvector of M for 2 is a discrete polynomial of degree k 1, for each k &lt; p. We have described elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref> the consequences in continuous time. The polynomials 1; t; : : :; t p1 are linear combinations of the scaling functions (t k). <p> The eigenvalue problem (0) = M (0) gives (n) at the integers. Note 2 The computation of b (i) assumed the existence of (t) in L 2 . We could prove this existence, by demonstrating that fl fl (m) (t) (n) (t) fl fl is a Cauchy sequence <ref> [17] </ref>. The requirement is the same Condition E, and the completeness of L 2 guarantees a limit (t). For simplicity we omit this step, and prove Theorem 4|that fl fl (t) (i) (t) fl fl converges to zero.
