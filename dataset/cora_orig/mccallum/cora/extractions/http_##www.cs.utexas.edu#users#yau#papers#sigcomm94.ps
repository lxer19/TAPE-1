Abstract: Interframe compression techniques, such as those used in MPEG video, give rise to a coded bit stream where picture sizes differ by a factor of 10 or more. As a result, buffering is needed to reduce (smooth) rate fluctuations of encoder output from one picture to the next; without smoothing, the performance of networks that carry such video traffic would be adversely affected. Various techniques have been suggested for controlling the output rate of a VBR encoder to alleviate network congestion or prevent buffer overflow. Most of these techniques, however, are lossy, and should be used only as a last resort. In this paper, we design and specify an algorithm for lossless smoothing. The algorithm is characterized by three parameters: D (delay bound), K (number of pictures with known sizes), and H (lookahead interval). We present a theorem which guarantees that, if K 1, the algorithm finds a solution that satisfies the delay bound. (Although the algorithm and theorem were motivated by MPEG video, they are applicable to the smoothing of compressed video in general.) To study performance characteristics of the algorithm, we conducted a large number of experiments using statistics from four MPEG video sequences.

Reference-contexts: The picture rate, as well as some other MPEG encoder parameters, can be adaptively controlled to modify the encoder output rate (see Section 3). Some researchers have described adaptive techniques for controlling the output rate of VBR encoders <ref> [2, 4, 9] </ref>. Since these VBR encoders are considered input sources of packet-switching networks, the techniques are sometimes referred to as source rate control or congestion control techniques. Most of these techniques are lossy. In this paper, we present an algorithm for smoothing picture-to-picture rate fluctuations in a video sequence. <p> Specifically, the encoder would control its output rate in response to feedback information from an entry point to a packet network or a point of congestion in the packet network <ref> [2, 4, 9] </ref>. These lossy techniques for rate control are inappropriate for reducing fluctuations in the bit rate for transmitting I, B, and P pictures in MPEG video for the following reason. <p> Another lossy technique that has been suggested for network congestion control is to reduce the picture rate by dropping some B pictures from the video sequence being transmitted <ref> [2] </ref>. Although dropping B pictures would reduce the average rate of the video sequence, it does not address the problem of picture-to-picture rate fluctuations of interest here. In summary, both spatial and temporal redundancy are greatly reduced in the coded bit stream of MPEG video. <p> Some researchers have described techniques for controlling the output rate of VBR encoders <ref> [2, 4, 9] </ref>. Most of these techniques are lossy, and are inappropriate for smoothing picture-to-picture rate fluctuations that are a consequence of interframe compression. For alleviating network congestion, the lossy techniques may be used in addition to loss-less smoothing.
