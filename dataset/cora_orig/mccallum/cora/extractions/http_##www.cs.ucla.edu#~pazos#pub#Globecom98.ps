Abstract: The use of ABR service on Internet backbones has been recently proposed as a means to improve statistical multiplexing and to recover the bandwidth left over by VBR traffic. While this approach permits far better utilization of ATM resources than it is possible otherwise with the CBR service, full link utilization is seldom achieved. In this paper we address the reasons why the ABR flow control cannot track the dynamic variations on the available bandwidth along backbone links and we propose an approach to improve resource utilization that relies on bandwidth overbooking. The proposed scheme avoids cell losses and unnecessary rate reductions.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The Available Bit Rate (ABR) service has been defined by the ATM Forum <ref> [1] </ref> for the transport of Internet traffic. With ABR, Internet sources can vaguely declare their resource requirements, but they are guaranteed no Quality of Service (QoS) commitments. The ATM network delivers a Best-Effort service while using the Internet traffic to improve network utilization. <p> ABR connections are subjected to a rate-based flow control: ABR sources adjust their transmission rates in accordance to a binary congestion feedback and/or an advertised bandwidth <ref> [1] </ref>: EFCI (Explicit Forward Congestion Indication) marking; relative marking; or explicit rate (ER) indication. The feedback information is transported on a stream of Re fl This research was funded by GTE y Bolsista do CNPq Braslia/Brasil source Management (RM) cells. <p> Nevertheless, if the Round Trip Time (RTT) is large and given that the ABR sources only probe the network at a rate proportional to their Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) (namely ACR/NRM <ref> [1] </ref>), the ABR sources will seldom have a timely and precise picture of the available bandwidth along the connections used. This is particularly important in a WAN scenario if the aggregate load of high priority VBR traffic varies in a time scale smaller than the RTT. <p> We further simplify our model by emphasizing the bottleneck link and abstracting non-bottleneck links, as describe in Figure 3. The ingress router performs the Source End System (SES) functions while the egress router performs the Destination End System (DES) functions as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. We assume that the appropriate congestion indications are stamped on RM cells on their forward pass through the bottleneck switch since this is a worst case scenario (the destination itself can be congested). We consider that the switches perform both ER indication and EFCI marking. <p> However, as depicted in Figure 3, reaction to such indications are subjected to a RTT delay. In addition, the RM cells are only generated at intervals of length NRM/ACR <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, with the current standards and even if precise ER computation is performed by the switches, it is unlikely that the ABR traffic can fully utilize the bandwidth, especially in a wide area scenario (long RTT) with very bursty VBR background traffic.

Reference-contexts: However, EFCI marking alone cannot implement max-min fairness and it suffers from a beat-down problem <ref> [2] </ref>. The use of ER indications in conjunction with EFCI marking, is a step in the right direction to provide a more effective flow control to the ABR traffic.

Reference-contexts: In such case, the ABR traffic is not capable of filling in the bandwidth leftover by the priority traffic, leading to poor network utilization and poor throughput for the Internet traffic. We study this issue in the scenario of ATM Virtual Private Networks (AVPN) <ref> [3] </ref> used for the transport of Internet traffic over ATM WANs (see Figure 1): backbone routers are interconnected by ABR Virtual Circuit Connections (VCCs) with a non-zero Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) allocation. Since ABR backbones transmit the aggregate traffic of many streams, routers probe the congestion on VCCs very frequently. <p> Since ABR backbones transmit the aggregate traffic of many streams, routers probe the congestion on VCCs very frequently. This may lead one to think that the link utilization along a VCC path is maximum even in the presence of rapidly fluctuating aggregate VBR traffic. However, we noted in <ref> [3] </ref> that these fluctuations on the background VBR traffic are not properly tracked by the ABR flow control.

Reference-contexts: We consider that the switches perform both ER indication and EFCI marking. We do not use rela tive marking as the DMRCA VQ approach in <ref> [4] </ref> because it combines the computation of fair shares per-connection with multiplicative decreases (CI marking). If the fair share is known, it is more effective to communicate it directly to the source through the ER field on RM cells. This is what EPRCA [5] and ERICA+ [6] schemes do. <p> This is what EPRCA [5] and ERICA+ [6] schemes do. We are then left with the ER computation. In ERICA+ [6] the connections are assumed to have MCR = 0 and their ERs "converge" to their max-min fair shares. In <ref> [4, 7, 8] </ref>, the max-min fair share computation reflects the MCR assignments. Since our goal in this paper is to study bandwidth overbooking once the appropriate ER is determined by the switch, we use previous ER computation results.

Proposition: Let the advertised ER OV be given by multiplying the actual available ER by 1 + ff, where: ff = max 0; flRTT fi ER and ff is an overbooking factor, fi and fl are two control parameters and Q L is the current ABR queue length.

Reference-contexts: BANDWIDTH OVERBOOKING One way to create a persistent backlog on the bottleneck switch is by overbooking the ER indications. However, precautions should be taken to avoid that this backlog exceeds the ABR queue (Q ABR ) threshold Q H since it was shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that this can lead to unnecessary rate reductions. FAIR OVERBOOKING SCHEME Let us first explore the parameters involved in determining how much to overbook the advertised bandwidth ER. The RTT and the actual ER are key parameters since they directly affect the number of excess cells in flight.
