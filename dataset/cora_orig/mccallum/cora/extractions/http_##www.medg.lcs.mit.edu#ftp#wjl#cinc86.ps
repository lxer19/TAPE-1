G., and Szolovits, P., </author> <title> "An Aid to Physiological Reasoning in the Management of Cardiovascular Disease," </title> <booktitle> 1984 Computers in Cardiology Conference, </booktitle> <pages> pp. 3-6, </pages> <year> 1984. </year>
Reference-contexts: Anticipating the mechanisms that will have the most important effects is a skill that requires considerable experience. The goal of the Heart Failure Program is to provide a tool that the practitioner can use for assistance in reasoning about the diagnostic and therapeutic questions involved in managing a patient <ref> [1] </ref>. While the program addresses many facets of the patient management process, this paper focuses on the development of a method to predict the response of a patient in a known disease state to a particular therapy or action.

Reference-contexts: The prime example of that strategy in the cardiovascular domain is Guyton's cardiovascular simulation <ref> [2] </ref>. That program consists of a large number of equations relating the physiological parameters.

Reference-contexts: Work on qualitative reasoning has produced a second kind of simulation strategy partially addressing these problems. The qualitative simulation approach applied to the medical field is exemplified by Kuipers work with Kassirer on qualitative simulation of fluid balance <ref> [3] </ref>. Using this technique, only the direction (monotonicity) of the relationship between two parameters is used to determine the changes. However, when the models become complicated, the amount of ambiguity in the solution increases.

Reference-contexts: Overall, the assumption of steady states is justified by the stability of the cardiovascular system <ref> [4] </ref>. The only possible problems would arise if transient states could occur that would change relationships between parameters sufficiently to change the next steady state. Integrations can be handled because the derivative of the integrated parameter is zero in steady state.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it is necessary to make some simplifying assumptions to apply the approach to our domain. The computational algorithm used in signal flow analysis is Mason's general gain formula <ref> [5] </ref>. To keep track of the mechanisms of influence and to determine the change in all parameters, we have derived a different version of this algorithm that computes the gain incrementally from parameter to parameter correcting for feedback each time a new feedback path is encountered.
Reference: [6] <author> Coleman, Thomas G. and Randall, James E. </author> <title> "HUMAN: A Comprehensive Physiological Model," </title> <journal> The Physiologist, </journal> <volume> 26 </volume> <pages> 15-21, </pages> <year> 1983. </year>
Reference-contexts: The model is based on constraint relations among the parameters. These relations come from both the physiology literature and clinical judgment 6 guided by the medical literature, including some relations derived from those in Coleman's HUMAN model <ref> [6] </ref>. Since the model is also the primary vehicle for explaining the predictions, it is important that the model be arranged in such a way that the relations are intuitive. The most natural way to think of relations seems to be causally in terms of blood flow.

Reference-contexts: From the Gorlin formula the relationship is: ARF low = AoLvP ressGrad fi DiastolicT ime fi k=Area The pressure gradient in turn has been approximated as proportional to mean arterial pressure by BP 30 determined from data in a paper in which the heart rate was varied <ref> [7] </ref>. Given this regurgitant volume, the effective cardiac output (CO) is the difference. In the papers used for refining the model, the patients were tested for their response to exercise and three therapies: propranolol, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine.

Reference-contexts: The remaining parameters then reflect the ability of the model to predict appropriately. The two papers on MS used patients with pure MS, no heart failure, and only somewhat elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. The paper by Giuffrida, et al <ref> [8] </ref>, measured the patients at rest, after 10 minutes of exercise, after resting for 20 minutes, 10 minutes after administration of propranolol, and after further exercise.

Reference-contexts: This total effect is consistent with parallel resistances only part of which is affected by the exercise. In the second MS paper by Bornheimer, et al <ref> [9] </ref>, the patients went through a similar protocol, except they were given nitroglycerin. These patients also had some heart failure with the majority on digitalis and diuretics. As a result, the SVR was elevated in these patients and decreased more with exercise than in normal patients.

Reference-contexts: The predicted HR was higher than actual and the LAP lower. There is a pattern of differences among the parameters indicating that the patients probably had additional impediments to increasing their cardiac output. The second disease studied was AS. The first paper <ref> [10] </ref> considered the effects of exercise in children with AS. From the data it was clear that the PVR decreased with increased flow as in normal individuals. Also, exercise seems to produce more decrease in SVR than in the adult chronic cases considered before.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the relationship between heart rate and systolic time is altered in AS. A suitable systolic time relationship was derived from the two papers. With these changes to the model, the predictions were all within the limits in the paper. The second AS paper <ref> [11] </ref> considered patients with AS and congestive heart failure who were given hydralazine. This paper illustrates a problem with the modeling of hydralazine.

Reference-contexts: This inotropic effect for hydralazine may have some other explanation with a more detailed model of the effects of afterload on CO, but inotropy is the simplest hypothesis at this level of modeling. The final paper <ref> [12] </ref> reports on patients with chronic aortic regurgitation exercised and given hydralazine. These patients were all chronic cases with mild to severe heart failure. Digitalis and diuretics were continued without change. Again, the SVR was higher than normal and responded more to exercise than in patients without heart failure.
