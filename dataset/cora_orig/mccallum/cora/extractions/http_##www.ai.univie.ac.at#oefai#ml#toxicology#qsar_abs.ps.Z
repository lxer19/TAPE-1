Previous approaches have focussed on one of these representations only, without performing a systematic comparison of different descriptors within a single framework. Structural Regression Trees (SRT), an Inductive Logic Programming algorithm, can handle both representations easily and is therefore especially suited for this comparison. The carcinogenicity classifications came from the NCI/NTP section of the Carcinogenic Potency Database. The best predictive accuracy was obtained with a combination of physical/chemical properties and structural fragments (75.2% accuracy with ten-fold cross-validation). Using physical/chemical and fragment descriptors alone yielded accuracies of 65.4% and 67.3% respectively. The performance of the model using both descriptor sets is distinctively better than the performance of other carcinogenicity SARs for noncongeneric compounds reported in the literature, which usually range between 60 and 70%.
