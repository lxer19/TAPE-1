Abstract: Random Early Detection (RED) was proposed as an active queue management algorithm for a gateway. This paper proposes to alter one of the design guidelines of RED that unconditionally allows transient congestion. This unconditional allowance of transient congestion is shown to be harmful when the queue is near full, easily causing buffer overflow at a gateway. A buffer overflow at a gateway leads to the global synchronization and oscillation of traffic load on the network. To effectively prevent the buffer overflow at a gateway, the RED framework is refined so that the gateway can detect the transient congestion in time and take actions to quench it when the queue is near full. To better understand the queueing behaviors at a backbone gateway, we use a simple simulation model driven by a real Internet traffic trace to evaluate the effectiveness of RED algorithm. Based on the observations of the simulation study, two enhancements are made to the estimation of average queue size. Equipped with these enhancements, the refined RED can make a good balance between the allowance of transient bursty traffic and the avoidance of buffer overflow. Extensive simulations are used to comparatively evaluate the performance of the refined and the original RED.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that the Web-based document transfers are short-lived, and the size of transmitted files ranges from 4 Kbytes to 20 Kbytes <ref> [1] </ref>. * In the Slow-Start algorithm, since a TCP sender has no knowledge of network capacity at the beginning of transmission, the sender often uses default values for parameters such as ssthresh, or Slow-Start threshold [8].

Reference-contexts: The overhead introduced by the RED gateway does not make any performance improvement during the period of buffer overflow. The simulation results shown in the next subsection confirm our analysis. According to trace statistics of TCP traffic <ref> [2] </ref>, 85% of the packets appear during the Slow-start phase, and only 15% of the packets appear during the Congestion Avoidance phase. This result indicates the oscillation of traffic load in the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The current Internet architecture is featured by the fact that the TCP congestion control is end-to-end, in which congestion control is solely accomplished by the end-hosts. However, it is recognized that the gateway is the most appropriate agent to detect incipient congestion and ensure the fairness in bandwidth allocation <ref> [3] </ref>. The performance of end-to-end congestion control will be greatly improved with the deployment of advanced mechanisms at the gateways.

Reference-contexts: The drop-tail gateway is simple, scalable and easy to implement. However, the drop-tail gateway is shown to arbitrarily distribute packet losses among TCP connections and also tends to penalize bursty connections <ref> [4] </ref>. The effects of global synchronization has been found in both one-way and two-way TCP traffic [12, 15], lowering aggregate throughput. 1 To resolve the drop-tail gateway problems, Early Random Drop Gateways were proposed [6].

Reference-contexts: The Early Random Drop gateway drops each arriving packet with a fixed drop probability if the queue length exceeds a drop level. Based on the Early Random Drop algorithm, the Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm was proposed by Floyd and Jacobson <ref> [5] </ref>. A RED gateway detects incipient congestion based on the computation of the average queue size and randomly drops or marks arriving packets before the buffer of a gateway becomes full. <p> By shifting the start time of the simulation, we can take different snapshots of the queueing behavior at the gateway. An interesting scenario is discussed in the next subsection. 4.1 Dynamics of Queueing Behavior To verify the effectiveness of the original RED, a low-pass filter as proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> is used to estimate the average queue size. Fig. 6 shows the dynamics of the queue in the normal and congested cases. During the simulation time period [0, 0.15s], the incoming traffic follows the typical ON-OFF pattern, causing the occurrence of buffer overflow for several times.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, this results in the sender transmitting too many packets too quickly, causing multiple packet losses from a window of data <ref> [7] </ref>. These losses in turn cause further problems in which fast recovery is poor in handling multiple dropped packets within the same window of data, hence the TCP sender often triggers a retransmission timeout.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The explosive growth of the Internet [14] makes congestion control at the transport-layer very important for the performance of the Internet. Since most of the Internet traffic is transported by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [11], TCP congestion control <ref> [8, 13] </ref> plays a key role in avoiding the congestion collapse of the Internet. The current Internet architecture is featured by the fact that the TCP congestion control is end-to-end, in which congestion control is solely accomplished by the end-hosts. <p> As soon as the queue is full, a RED gateway will degrade to a drop-tail gateway. 3.1 Analysis of the Dynamics of the TCP Window Size According to the TCP congestion-control schemes initiated in <ref> [8] </ref>, the TCP window size wnd is set to the minimum of the congestion window size cwnd and the receiver advertised window size rwnd . <p> are short-lived, and the size of transmitted files ranges from 4 Kbytes to 20 Kbytes [1]. * In the Slow-Start algorithm, since a TCP sender has no knowledge of network capacity at the beginning of transmission, the sender often uses default values for parameters such as ssthresh, or Slow-Start threshold <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The probability of dropping a packet from a particular connection is roughly proportional to that connection's share of the bandwidth through the gateway. Lin and Morris <ref> [9] </ref> found that RED allows unfair bandwidth sharing when a mixture of different traffic shares a link. Their key observation is that dropping packets from flows in proportion to their bandwidths does not ensure the fairness in sharing bandwidth. <p> There are two functions of a congestion avoidance mechanism at the RED gateway. One is to detect incipient congestion, and the other is to decide which connections to notify of congestion at the gateway. The work done by Lin and Morris <ref> [9] </ref> mainly focused on the second function. They improved the fairness of RED by modifying the way of notifying congestion at the gateway. However, the way of detecting incipient congestion was left unaddressed.

Since most of the Internet traffic is transported by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [11], TCP congestion control [8, 13] plays a key role in avoiding the congestion collapse of the Internet. <p> Therefore, the RED algorithm is made non-responsive to transient congestion. At a gateway, many flows converge in, and the traffic seen by the gateway is a mixture of various types. TCP traffic is the most dominant component in the Internet <ref> [14] </ref>. Basically, there are two kinds of TCP transmissions: (1) long-lived bulk-data transmission; (2) interactive-data transmission or short-lived bulk-data transmission.
