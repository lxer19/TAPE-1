Abstract: In [3], Bodlaender and Engelfriet proved that for every k, and d, there exists a constant c k;d , such that every graph with treewidth at most k and maximum degree at most d has domino treewidth at most c k;d . This note gives a new, simpler proof of this fact, with a much better bound for c k;d , namely (9k + 7)d(d + 1) 1.

Reference-contexts: 2k +2 vertices in S adjacent to vertices in W (namely the vertices in at most two bags of the tree decomposition), hence at most (2k + 2)d vertices in W that are adjacent to a vertex in S.) To effectively obtain the set S, first apply the algorithm in <ref> [1] </ref> to obtain an arbitrary tree decomposition of width at most k. It is not hard to see that the proofs given above then can be carried out in linear time. 2 3 The domino treewidth theorem In this section, we proof the main result of this section.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [3] </ref>, Bodlaender and Engelfriet give the following result: for every k, and d, there exists a constant c k;d , such that every graph with treewidth at most k and maximum degree at most d has domino treewidth at most c k;d .

The proof given in [3] was quite complicated, and the constant c k;d was exponential in k and d. In this note, a new and easier to understand proof of the fact is given. <p> However, the proof in <ref> [3] </ref> can be turned into an algorithm that uses linear time. The proof given above seems unable to yield linear time algorithms the approach typically leads to algorithmic results of (n log n) time.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the constant factor arising from the proof given here is much smaller: it is shown that graphs with treewidth at most k and maximum degree at most d have domino treewidth at most (9k + 7)d (d + 1) 1. The proof uses amongst others a technique from <ref> [4] </ref> (inspired by a tech nique from [8]), and some other ideas. <p> It is not hard to see that the proofs given above then can be carried out in linear time. 2 3 The domino treewidth theorem In this section, we proof the main result of this section. The technique is inspired by a technique from <ref> [4] </ref>, which was again inspired by a technique from [8]. Theorem 3.1 Let G = (V; E) be a graph with treewidth at most k and maximum degree at most d. Then the domino treewidth of G is at most (9k + 7)d (d + 1) 1. <p> Apart from this idea, the structure of the algorithm is similar to algorithms found in <ref> [8, 4] </ref>. Corollary 3.2 Let k be a constant. Given a graph with treewidth at most k and maximum degree at most d, a domino tree decomposition of G of width at most (9k + 7)d (d + 1) 1 can be built in O (n 2 ) time. <p> The following lemma is well known.
