Abstract: Almost all commercially available information retrieval systems allow users to submit Boolean queries. These, along with many of the research systems, use inverted files to aid in query processing. To better understand these systems, we consider inverted files and methods to create them, as discussed in Chapter 3. The actual processing of Boolean queries involves operations on sets (that are identified from the inverted file), which are discussed in Chapter 12. Finally, in Chapter 15 we consider extensions to Boolean query processing that has been shown in research studies to yield significantly higher precision at all levels of recall. This Unit deals with three chapters and one computer exercise. In addition, there is one optional reading, for those with particular interest in extended Boolean retrieval methods. Class time will be devoted primarily to lectures, questions and individual work.

Reference-contexts: What would be the special advantages or disadvantages of MMM vs. Paice vs. P-norm, if the queries involved were all very, very long? 5 Comments on Readings The supplemental, optional reading <ref> [1] </ref> gives additional background on the overall topic of Chapter 15, that is, extended Boolean approaches. It focuses on the P-norm model, and gives experimental evidence for its utility.
