Reference-contexts: Furthermore there are a lot of theoretical models to simulate the various kinds of uncertainty. To stay flexible in RELFUN <ref> [1] </ref>, no special model is chosen here. It is left to the user to decide in which way he wants to describe the uncertainty of his particular problem.

Reference-contexts: bagof or tupof , is it possible to deduce all solutions in our implementation, and then compute the solution with the greatest uncertainty factor 4 of this collection of solutions (see function fetch [5] or reduce applied to maxp). 2 Example `Pet Holder' This section formalizes the realistic example of <ref> [2] </ref> with RELFUN's uncertainty-valued Horn clauses. In German law, the owner of a pet is not always liable for the damage caused by his pet. The pet holder, who can be the owner, the horseman, the buyer, the finder of a deserted pet, and so on, is responsible.

Reference-contexts: But the observation that most of these OR-combined models are mathematically inconsistent anyway <ref> [3] </ref> makes this restriction appear an advantage.

Reference-contexts: It is based on a proposal by Harold Boley and a lot of implementational help by Michael Sintek. 1.1 The Uncertainty Structure There are many forms of uncertainty; for example there is vagueness (fuzzi-ness in particular), probability, and so on <ref> [4] </ref>. Furthermore there are a lot of theoretical models to simulate the various kinds of uncertainty. To stay flexible in RELFUN [1], no special model is chosen here. It is left to the user to decide in which way he wants to describe the uncertainty of his particular problem.
