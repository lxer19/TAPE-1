Reference-contexts: For the past several years, there has been a spurt of research on a class of graphs called Cayley graphs that are very suitable for designing interconnection networks. Cayley graphs are based on permutation groups and include a large number of families of graphs, like star graphs <ref> [AK89, AK87, QMA91] </ref>, hypercubes [BA84], pancake graphs [AK89, QAM93] and others [AT91, Sch91, DT92]. These graphs are symmetric (edges are bidirectional), regular, and seem to share many of the desirable properties like low diameter, low degree, high fault tolerance etc. with the well-known hypercubes (which are also Cayley graphs).

(3) follows from (1) and (2). 2 3 Routing Schemes 3.1 A Simple Routing Scheme Since G n is a Cayley graph, it is vertex symmetric <ref> [AK89] </ref>, i.e., we can always view the distance between any two arbitrary nodes as the distance between the source node and the identity permutation by suitably renaming the symbols representing the permutations. For example, let cab be the source node and bca be the destination node.

Reference-contexts: There are also important applications for which the computing nodes in the interconnection network can have only a fixed number of I/O ports <ref> [SP89, CAB93] </ref>. There are graphs in the literature that have constant node degrees, like the Cube-Connected Cycles [PV81] where the degree of any node is 3 irrespective of the size of the graph. These cube-connected cycle graphs can be viewed as Cayley graphs [CCSW85].

The graph has a diameter logarithmic in the number of nodes, are regular and dense, and is maximally fault tolerant.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the node v can reach (by vertex disjoint paths) to four distinct f -cycles, say f j1 ; f j2 ; f j3 ; and f j4 . Note that it is possible that f i` = f jk for some ` and m. By Menger's theorem <ref> [Har72] </ref>, given two sets of nodes V 1 and V 2 such that jV 1 j = jV 2 j = n in a n-connected graph, there are n vertex disjoint paths connecting the nodes from V 1 to those in V 2 .

Reference-contexts: An excellent survey of these Cayley graphs (along with extensive bibliography) can be found in <ref> [LJD93] </ref>. All Cayley graphs are regular, i.e., each node has the same degree, but for Cayley graphs studied to date, the degree of the nodes increases with the size of the graph (the number of nodes) either logarithmically or sublogarithmically.

But, neither De Bruijn graphs nor Moebius graphs are regular; none of them can be viewed as Cayley graphs.
