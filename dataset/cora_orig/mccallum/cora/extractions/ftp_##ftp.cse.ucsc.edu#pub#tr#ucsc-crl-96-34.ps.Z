Reference-contexts: More precisely, a network break is defined to be a break fault in the p-network or in the n-network of a CMOS cell that breaks one or more transistor paths between the cell output and Vdd or GND. Previous work <ref> [31, 14, 42, 6, 2, 21, 7] </ref>, mostly in the context of transistor stuck-open faults, studied test invalidation due to transient 2 paths to Vdd or GND and due to charge sharing. <p> Reddy, et al. [31] showed that transient paths to Vdd or GND can invalidate a two-vector test in transistor stuck-open testing. Barzilai, et al. <ref> [2] </ref> showed that charge sharing between the internal nodes of the faulty cell and the high impedance faulty cell output can also invalidate a test. <p> Lee and Breuer [21] proposed a scheme for handling charge sharing in transistor stuck-open fault testing using both I DDQ and voltage measurements, but measuring both current and voltage may not be feasible during testing. Barzilai, et al. <ref> [2] </ref> described a fault simulator for transistor stuck-open and stuck-on faults. For handling charge sharing, they partitioned all the nodes in every cell into two classes. They assumed that nodes in the first class have small enough capacitances so that these nodes could be ignored. <p> Those mechanisms are said to potentially invalidate a test. Two mechanisms that may invalidate a test, transient paths to Vdd or GND and charge sharing, have been studied in the context of transistor stuck-open faults and CMOS opens 6 by many researchers <ref> [31, 14, 42, 6, 2, 21, 7] </ref>. This chapter shows that Miller effects due to the gate-drain and gate-source capacitances of the CMOS transistors can modify the voltage of the faulty cell output when it is at high impedance. <p> Figure 2.1 shows two cases for an output assignment of 00 and S0 for an AND gate. Other researchers studied the effect of transient paths to Vdd or GND on test invalidation extensively <ref> [31, 14, 42, 2] </ref>, here illustrated with an example. Consider the p-network break in Figure 2.2. The cell input assignments shown form a proposed test for this break.

Reference-contexts: A break inside a CMOS cell can affect the connections between the bulk of an n channel transistor and GND, or the bulk of a p-channel transistor and Vdd. 4. A break can disconnect a single transistor gate from its driver <ref> [4, 32] </ref>. Among these types, type 1 is the mostly likely one due to 3, 4, or even 5 layers of metal used for interconnect in modern ICs. Vias are especially susceptible to breaks, and the number of vias exceeds the number of transistors in some microprocessor designs [38]. <p> A transistor path is a sequence of transistors physically connected through their drain and source terminals. Note that transistor stuck-open faults form a subset of network break faults. Renovell and Cambon [32], and Champac, et al. <ref> [4] </ref> showed that a transistor stuck-open test set can also detect some of the type 4 breaks, which create single floating transistor gates. <p> Die Surface and Trapped Charge in Testing for Interconnect Opens The electrical charge trapped on the floating wires created by opens during fabrication is important, because it is one of the factors that determines the voltage on a floating gate <ref> [32, 4, 23, 12, 36] </ref>, thus determining the behavior of the cell this floating-gate transistor is in. Johnson [15] designed and performed trapped charge measurements on test structures that consist of floating-gate p-channel and n-channel transistors with varying lengths of poly extensions.

Reference-contexts: This section discusses the conditions necessary for a feedback bridging fault and an interconnect open to display feedback behavior, where feedback behavior means either oscillation or sequential behavior. In order for a feedback bridging fault between a back wire and a front wire <ref> [5] </ref> to display feedback behavior, the combinational path from its back wire to the front wire must be sensitized. <p> Also, the average number of capacitances a wire has to its neighboring nodes is independent of 70 the circuit size, and again depends on the functionality of the circuit. The total number of realistic bridging faults for each ISCAS85 circuit reported by Chess and Larrabee <ref> [5] </ref> shows that this number more or less has a linear trend with the circuit size. Since a bridging fault indicates the existence of a wire-to-wire capacitance between the potentially shorted wires, the average number of wire-to-wire capacitances per wire remains more or less the same.

Moreover, Di and Jess [7] ignored static hazards, ignored Miller effects, and assumed constant capacitances for internal nodes of a cell. The total time Carafe took for break fault extraction for the whole cell library was less than 20 seconds. <p> Taking the fact that 2.6 to 3.9 times more network breaks per circuit were simulated, the CPU times per vector are better than the ones reported by Di and Jess <ref> [7] </ref>, where they used an HP-9000/700.

Reference-contexts: Note that excessive trapped charge on a floating wire may create a dangerous voltage level during fabrication such that a gate-oxide punch through may occur creating a gate-oxide short. This is different from a conventional gate-oxide short <ref> [37, 11] </ref>, because it is coupled with a floating wire, and the cause of this gate-oxide short is an open. This dissertation does not consider this case, leaving it for further research. Appendix A provides the experimental evidence for the RC interconnect effect of the die surface.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Defects that occur during the integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing process can be categorized into three classes according to Hawkins, et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, which provides a very extensive list of references on this topic. These classes are bridge, open circuit (break), and parametric delay defects. Breaks in the conducting materials of a circuit layout cause unintended open circuits. <p> Die Surface and Trapped Charge in Testing for Interconnect Opens The electrical charge trapped on the floating wires created by opens during fabrication is important, because it is one of the factors that determines the voltage on a floating gate <ref> [32, 4, 23, 12, 36] </ref>, thus determining the behavior of the cell this floating-gate transistor is in. Johnson [15] designed and performed trapped charge measurements on test structures that consist of floating-gate p-channel and n-channel transistors with varying lengths of poly extensions.

Reference-contexts: f loat is actually floating is taken into account, then the following equation needs to be satisfied, also: Q init = Q s + C GND V float + C V dd (V float V dd) where Q init is the trapped charge on f loat during the fabrication process <ref> [15] </ref> [17]. <p> An interconnect open creates a floating metal wire that might collect electrical charge during the fabrication process <ref> [15] </ref> [22]. Appendix A [17] shows that trapped charge on floating metal wires connected to transistor gates can create voltages in the range between -1V to 1V in a set of experimental chips fabricated with an HP 0.8 process. <p> As another factor to be considered for predicting the behavior of a floating wire, Chapter 3 pointed out to charge collector diodes. * The trapped charge measurement results given in Appendix A together with the ones reported by Johnson <ref> [15] </ref> show the unpredictability of trapped charge values, which is taken into account in the fault simulation algorithm presented in Chapter 4. 74 Appendix A. <p> Johnson <ref> [15] </ref> designed and performed trapped charge measurements on test structures that consist of floating-gate p-channel and n-channel transistors with varying lengths of poly extensions. These measurements showed that there was always a positive charge on the floating poly, and the voltage created by this charge ranged from 0.1V to 2.3V. <p> In this state, the measured gate voltage on the reference transistor will be the same as the gate voltage on the floating-gate transistor. This method is also used by Johnson <ref> [15] </ref>, but our measurement technique shown in Figure A.1 keeps the drain-source voltage fixed at 0.2V, thus eliminating the hot electron effect that might otherwise alter the amount of the trapped charge, as explained in Section A.1.2. <p> These metal wires are not surrounded by any other wire, that is, the floating-gate voltage can be controlled only by controlling the source-drain voltage. This is also the technique used by Johnson <ref> [15] </ref>. Figure A.2 shows our measurement circuitry for this technique. A similar circuit is also used by Pricket, et al. [28]. <p> The extrapolation error with C fw = 34fF corresponding to transistor 7 with the largest C fw among transistors 7-12 was -0.07V. Therefore, the extrapolation error for transistors 8-11 should be between -0.5V and -0.07V. Even though Johnson <ref> [15] </ref> has not reported his extrapolation errors, his should be similar to the ones reported here. <p> and keeping the drain-source voltage fixed at 0.2V as shown in Figure A.1 ensures that the F G transistor will be in the linear region while taking measurements, whereas controlling the F G voltage with the source or drain terminal of the F G transistor, as also done by Johnson <ref> [15] </ref>, allows the transistor to be only in the saturation region while taking measurements, unless there is a large enough 81 V tc on the gate. <p> So, as the floating wire gets closer to the die surface, it becomes more influenced by the voltage change on the Vdd-ring, which supports the die surface conduction speculation. It does not surprise me that Johnson <ref> [15] </ref> has not reported any such phenomenon, because all of the poly extensions in his F G transistors were covered by metal lines connected to transistor drains or sources, which shielded the poly extensions from the die surface. <p> One main conclusion from these measurements is that floating gate transistors with no or some poly extensions have negative trapped charge voltages sitting on their gates, up to almost -4V. This is in contrast with Johnson's measurements <ref> [15] </ref>, who measured always positive charge on his floating gate transistors, which also had some or no poly extensions. This clearly shows the fabrication process dependence of the trapped charge polarity.

Reference-contexts: When ds is f c's output, then the max n terms in Figure 2.5 will be replaced by Vdd. 2.4 Implementation and Experimental Results I implemented the fault simulation algorithm described in the previous section on top of the Nemesis single-stuck-at fault simulator <ref> [20] </ref>. I used the ISCAS85 benchmark circuits implemented with the MCNC standard cell library for my experiments. For charge difference computations, I used the BSIM model parameters for the HP 0.6 n-well fabrication process. <p> This section attempts to estimate how much more. Assuming that each via represents a potential interconnect open, Table 4.1 compares the number of vias against the number of collapsed stuck-at faults computed by Nemesis <ref> [20] </ref> in the seven largest ISCAS85 circuits to give an idea about the size of the fault space for an interconnect open fault simulator. In Table 4.1, the number of vias is roughly twice the number of collapsed stuck-at faults.

This chapter shows that Miller effects due to the gate-drain and gate-source capacitances of the CMOS transistors can modify the voltage of the faulty cell output when it is at high impedance.

Reference-contexts: An interconnect open creates a floating metal wire that might collect electrical charge during the fabrication process [15] <ref> [22] </ref>. Appendix A [17] shows that trapped charge on floating metal wires connected to transistor gates can create voltages in the range between -1V to 1V in a set of experimental chips fabricated with an HP 0.8 process. <p> This creates a hazard for the gate-oxide of the transistors the floating metal-1 is connected to when the metal-1 wire is very long, and can collect significant charge from the plasma to create a high voltage (antenna effect <ref> [22] </ref>). One common technique to bleed this charge is the use of diodes as shown in Figure 3.14, which are called charge collector diodes.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, a network break is defined to be a break fault in the p-network or in the n-network of a CMOS cell that breaks one or more transistor paths between the cell output and Vdd or GND. Previous work <ref> [31, 14, 42, 6, 2, 21, 7] </ref>, mostly in the context of transistor stuck-open faults, studied test invalidation due to transient 2 paths to Vdd or GND and due to charge sharing. <p> Reddy, et al. <ref> [31] </ref> showed that transient paths to Vdd or GND can invalidate a two-vector test in transistor stuck-open testing. Barzilai, et al.

Reference-contexts: A new fault simulation algorithm for network breaks is presented with the following novel features: First, the electrical charge coming from Miller and p-n junction capacitances is computed using a transistor charge model <ref> [35] </ref>; this automatically handles the non-linear nature of transistor capacitances accurately, as opposed to assuming constant capacitance values as was done in previous work. Second, this fault simulation algorithm uses only six voltage levels for charge computations, which allows the use of look-up tables that dramatically reduce the computation time. <p> The following two components exist for the charge stored on any faulty cell node f cn 2 F CN . 1. Each transistor drain or source terminal ds connected to f cn stores charge in the intrinsic, or channel, area of the transistor when the transistor is on <ref> [35] </ref>. This charge 13 is a function of the voltages at the terminals of the transistor t and the size of t. <p> However, the use of look-up tables as described in Section 2.4 may no longer be feasible.
