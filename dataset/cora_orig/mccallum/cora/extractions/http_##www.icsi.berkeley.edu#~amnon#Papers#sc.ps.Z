Abstract: We show that the minimum size of a depth-two N -superconcentrator is fi(N log 2 N= log log N ). Before this work, optimal bounds were known for all depths except two. For the upper bound, we build superconcentrators by putting together a small number of disperser graphs; these disperser graphs are obtained using a probabilistic argument. We present two different methods for showing lower bounds. First, we show that superconcentrators contain several disjoint disperser graphs. When combined with the lower bound for disperser graphs due to K-ovari, Sos and Turan, this gives an almost optimal lower bound of (N (log N= log log N ) 2 ) on the size of N - superconcentrators. The second method, based on the work of Hansel, gives the optimal lower bound. The method of the K-ovari, Sos and Turan can be extended to give tight lower bounds for extractors, both in terms of the number of truly random bits needed to extract one additional bit and in terms of the unavoidable entropy loss in the system. If the input is an n-bit source with min-entropy k and the output is required to be within a distance of * from uniform distribution, then to extract even a constant number of additional bits, one must invest at least log(n k) + 2 log(1=*) O(1) truly random bits; to obtain m output bits one must invest at least m k + 2 log(1=*) O(1). Thus, there is a loss of 2 log(1=*) bits during the extraction. Interestingly, in the case of dispersers this loss in entropy is only about log log(1=*).

Reference-contexts: If G is an a-expanding graph, then G (the bipartite complement of G) has no subgraph isomorphic to K a;a . Such graphs have been studied extensively, and the problem of determining the maximum possible number of edges in these graphs is known as the Zarankiewicz problem (see <ref> [Bol78, pages 309-326] </ref>). An elegant averaging argument, due to K-ovari, Sos and Turan, gives good upper bounds on the number of edges in these graphs. When applied to dispersers, this method gives the following lower bounds.

The following table gives a summary of the results. <p> In general, (d; N ) decays very rapidly as d grows; fi grows more slowly than the inverse of any primitive recursive function. We refer the reader to <ref> [DDPW83] </ref> for the definition of and fi. Thus, the dependence of the size on the depth was well understood for all depths except two. In this paper, we close this gap. Let size (N ) denote the size of the smallest depth-two N -superconcentrator.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, the entropy loss (which can be compared to the heat wasted in a physical process) has different magnitudes in dispersers (about log log 1 * ) and extractors (about 2 log 1 * ). Goldreich and Wigder-son <ref> [GW94, section 6] </ref> show the existence of explicit (k; *)-extractors E : f0; 1g n fi f0; 1g d ! f0; 1g n , with d = n k + 2 log 1 * + 2.

Reference-contexts: To obtain the optimal lower bound, we use a method based on the work of Hansel <ref> [Han64] </ref> (see also Katona and Sze-meredi [KS67]). Dispersers and extractors. One special case of disperser graphs is the class of highly-expanding graphs [Pip87] , sometimes called a-expanding graphs [WZ93]. <p> We thus have three tasks ahead of us. * First, we need to show how to obtain sets S and T . For this we use a method based on the work of Hansel <ref> [Han64] </ref>. We go through all vertices in C i , and for each, either delete all its neighbors in A or all its neighbors in B. Clearly, after this the surviving vertices in A and B do not have any common neighbor in C i .

Reference-contexts: So, at least half of the vertices of C i are common neighbors of X and Y . Thus: Claim 3.1 Any two sets X A ; Y B of size K have at least K common neighbors in C. However, as shown by Meshulam <ref> [Mes84] </ref>, Menger's theorem implies that this is sufficient for G to be a superconcentrator (clearly, it is necessary). Thus, all that is left is to check the sizes of the edge sets E i .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3 shows that the entropy loss of 2 log 1 * in their extractor unavoidable, and the result of Wigderson and Zuckerman [WZ93] is tight up to a constant additive term.

Furthermore, our lower bounds match the upper bounds (obtained using well-known probabilistic arguments) up to constant factors.
