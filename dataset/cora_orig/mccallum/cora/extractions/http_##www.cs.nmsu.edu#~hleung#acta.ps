Abstract: We develop a new algorithm for determining if a given nondeterministic finite automaton is limited in nondeterminism. From this, we show that the number of nondeterministic moves of a finite automaton, if limited, is bounded by 2 n 2 where n is the number of states. If the finite automaton is over a one-letter alphabet, using Gohon's result the number of nondeterministic moves, if limited, is less than n 2 . In both cases, we present families of finite automata demonstrating that the upper bounds obtained are almost tight. We also show that the limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves of finite automata is PSPACE-hard. Since the problem is already known to be in PSPACE, it is therefore PSPACE-complete.

Reference-contexts: a nondeterministic union of M 1 ; : : : ; M m , we have L ([ m j =1 M j ) = [ m j =1 ( m L j ) = m " m fl (Note that a string similar to w m was considered in <ref> [AHU74, p. 411] </ref>.) The amount of guessing for [ m j =1 M j is log 2 m since M j is deterministic for each j 2 f1; 2; : : : ; mg. <p> Then by Savitch's theorem <ref> [AHU74, p. 370] </ref>, the limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves of finite automata is in PSPACE. Together with the following lemma, this problem is PSPACE-complete. Lemma 15 The limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves of a finite automaton is PSPACE-hard. Proof.

Reference-contexts: For NFAs over a one-letter alphabet, we present (in Sect. 5) a family of NFA's which require (n 2 6n + 8)=4 nondeterministic moves where n is the number 598 H. Leung of states. Moreover, it is known <ref> [Go85] </ref> that the number of nondeterministic moves, if limited, is less than n 2 . 4. We show (in Sect. 6) that the limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves of finite automata is PSPACE-hard. <p> exists a family of finite automata fB m j m 1g over a two-letter alphabet with limited nondeterminism such that the amount of guessing is 2 fi (n= log n) where n = fi (m log m) denotes the number of states in B m . 5 One-letter alphabet Gohon <ref> [Go85] </ref> considered distance automata over a one-letter alphabet. It was shown that if the distance is bounded, then it is less than n 2 where n is the number of states with the assumption that the distance of each transition is either zero or one.

Reference-contexts: However, it is known ([S90], <ref> [GLW92] </ref>) that for each positive integer k , there exists a finite automaton M k not limited in nondeterminism such that the length of the shortest accepted string which requires at least n nondetermistic moves is fi (n k ). <p> We illustrate the computations of the decision algorithm using an example. Consider the NFA M given in Fig. 1. This example NFA M is taken from <ref> [GLW92] </ref>. It has been established that M is not limited in nondeterminism and the length of a shortest accepted string which requires at least n nondeterministic moves is fi (n 2 ). Initially (at stage 0), all subsets of states are not reduced.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the same proof also establishes that the limitedness problem for finitely ambiguous distance automata is PSPACE-hard.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown independently by Hashiguchi ([H82], <ref> [H90] </ref>), Leung ([L88], [L91]) and Simon ([S88], [S94]) that the limitedness problem of distance automata is decidable in single exponential time and PSPACE-hard. <p> Hence, the limitedness problem of the number of nondeterministic moves (equivalently, the amount of guessing) of finite automata is decidable in single exponential time. Since an NFA is "0-deterministic", one can also deduce from <ref> [H90] </ref> that the number of nondeterministic moves of an NFA, if finite, must be bounded by 2 4n 3 +2n 2 +5n where n is the number of states. From this, a PSPACE algorithm can also be derived. <p> Our aim is to determine a better On finite automata with limited nondeterminism 597 upper bound on the number of nondeterministic moves given that it is bounded. The previous techniques for dealing with distance automata are a combinatorial method using the pigeonhole principle ([H82], <ref> [H90] </ref>, [H96]), an algebraic method using semigroup theory and topology ([L88], [L91]) and an algebraic method using semigroup theory and Ramsey theory [S94]. <p> Thus, the same proof also establishes that the limitedness problem for finitely ambiguous distance automata is PSPACE-hard. Moreover, since the nondeterministic behavior of an NFA in terms of the number of nondeterministic moves can be modelled by a 0-deterministic DA (see [H82], <ref> [H90] </ref>, [W93] for a definition), the limitedness problem for 0-deterministic distance automata is again PSPACE-hard.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is well known that deterministic finite automata (DFA) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) both express the same class of languages, that is regular languages. However, for some regular languages ([MF71], <ref> [Mo71] </ref>), the introduction of nondeterminism can help to reduce exponentially the number of states needed for denoting the languages. It has been proposed [KW80] to study nondeterminism in finite automata as a resource by measuring it.
