Abstract: A computational model that uses crude corrective movements to learn accurate reaching programs is presented. The model learns a feed-forward motor program in the form of pulse-step commands which drive a dynamic, 2 DOF, planar arm. The arm is actuated by two pairs of opposing muscles, which drive the shoulder and elbow joints. The model is able to learn motor programs that accurately bring the arm to the target, while producing in many cases bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, only four parameters are represented by the learning controller. The time of transition from 1 Pulse-step control of rapid eye movements has been well established (Robinson, 1975); this form of control appears to be a reasonable abstraction in the context of arm movements <ref> (Ghez and Martin, 1982) </ref>.

The step phase sets the threshold of the stretch reflex that is responsible for slowing the arm, and thereafter maintaining the arm at the target <ref> (Ghez and Martin, 1982) </ref>. In addition to the learning controller, our model assumes the existence of a pre-wired corrective control module that is capable of making crude movements in the approximate direction of the target.

Reference-contexts: The non linear damping provided by the stretch reflex is approximated by _ l 1=5 , where _ l is the velocity of muscle stretch <ref> (Gielen and Houk, 1984) </ref>. The passive forces are modeled as exponentials, the magnitudes of which are only significant near the joint limit, as in Winters and Stark (1985). For an agonist/antagonist pair of muscles, the control signals specify a unique equilibrium point for the joint.

The dependence of tension on velocity is described by the Hill equation for shortening (Winters and Stark, 1987), and is dominated by the stretch reflex during lengthening.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is also related to Kawato's feedback error learning, in that training is driven by movement produced by a controller external to the learning system <ref> (Kawato and Gomi, 1992) </ref>. However, our model differs from this work in two key ways. First, feedback in our model is not provided continuously, rather it is available sporadically. Second, our model does not require the use of a high-quality reference trajectory from which the corrective movements are computed.
