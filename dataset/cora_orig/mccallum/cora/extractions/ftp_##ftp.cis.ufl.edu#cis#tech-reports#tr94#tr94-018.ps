Reference-contexts: Early 5 work using this approach was by Montanari [21] who solved a system of linear equations to compute loci of equidistant points. The Voronoi diagram [28] is a useful geometric structure which contains complete planar proximity information for a set of points <ref> [1] </ref>. This allows for simplified computation of a distance map directly from the Voronoi diagram. Furthermore, the Voronoi diagram of boundary line segments of a polygon is closely associated to its medial axis.

Reference-contexts: We note that classifying characters according to the topology is justified on account of the constrained nature of our database and the quality of our characters (no gaps.) When dealing with databases of poorer quality, it may not be reasonable <ref> [27, 2] </ref> to attempt such preclassification without additional preprocessing. 26 Classification Number Error Classification Cases of Errors Rate Rate 0-9 7 1.02% 98.98 % A-Z, Graphics, 83 2.34% 97.66% 0-9 Table 3: Performance evaluation for three classification cases: [0-9], [A-Z] and [A-Z, Graphics, 0-9] for Voronoi skeleton representation.

Reference-contexts: If P has more than one nearest neighbor, then P is said to be a skeletal point of R. 3 The union of all skeletal points is called the skeleton or medial axis of R." An analogous definition is given by Blum using the well-known prairie fire analogy <ref> [3] </ref>; if one applies fire to all the sides of P , and lets the fire propagate at constant speed, then the skeleton is the locus of points where (fire) wave fronts meet. The skeleton of a planar object relates the internal structure of the object to significant boundary features.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the easiest and simplest algorithms are those based on non-Euclidean metrics, which lead to skeletons that are not accurate in terms of the fire front paradigm described earlier. However, algorithms that compute correct Euclidean distance maps do exist <ref> [4] </ref>. Skeletonization algorithms using quasi-Euclidean and Euclidean maps follow ridges in the distance map to construct a skeleton. However, the problem with these methods are that connectivity is not guaranteed [13]. Analytic computation of symmetric axes. <p> Non-Euclidean metrics (city-block distance, chessboard distance among others), lead to simple skeletonization algorithms, but can result in inaccuracy of upto 40% with respect to Euclidean distances [13]. While methods to compute Euclidean <ref> [4] </ref> or quasi-Euclidean [22] distance maps exist, these methods do not guarantee connectivity. Gaps occur due to the discrete domain on which pattern shapes are embedded, and are usually filled in by postprocessing steps.

Reference-contexts: In the following paragraphs we show that these properties 22 provide a significant advantage over traditional skeletonization techniques. Skeletons computed by thinning algorithms are constrained by 4 or 8 connectivity of a discrete grid in which the object shapes are embedded <ref> [5] </ref>. The typical drawback of such approaches is the loss of Euclidean metrics. Furthermore thinning algorithms also have to deal with redundant edges as a result of noise artifacts on the boundary of object shapes.

Reference-contexts: In addition, our algorithm features a robust numerical scheme to compute non-linear parabolic edges that avoids having to solve equations of degree greater than two. 7 We present experimental results, in which over ten thousand handprinted characters were rec-ognized with a 2.34% error rate by a neural net classifier <ref> [7] </ref> trained with Voronoi skeletons of character shapes, from a class of 52 distinct alphanumeric and graphical patterns.

In the remaining sections we present the details of our approach. <p> The binary skeletons consisting of 256 input nodes were then used to drive the neural network with distinct training and testing samples from the 52 alphanumeric patterns in our database. 4.3 Neural Network Topology We employed a conjugate gradient method to train a neural network <ref> [7] </ref> containing at most three hidden nodes and 52 output nodes. The number of hidden nodes was determined experimentally by varying the number of hidden nodes and identifying the best results.

The database consisted of 52 distinct patterns containing over 10,000 samples, collected from 17 different writers. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of patterns in our database. The characters included were well defined. <p> In addition, only upper-case alphabets were considered, and the numeral `4' was required to be closed. Sample characters are shown in Figure 10. Sample patterns were collected on forms and were digitized at 300dpi/8bit resolution.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the medial axis is exactly contained in the set of Voronoi edges of the polygon, and can be obtained simply by deleting the two Voronoi edges incident with each concave vertex <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus construction of the Voronoi diagram is clearly a technique for the skeletonization of polygonal shapes. 1.3 Skeletons Derived from Voronoi Diagrams Using the Voronoi diagram to compute the skeleton of a polygonal shape is attractive because it results in skeletons which are connected while retaining Euclidean metrics. <p> In this case the set of sites include the edges and vertices of the polygon. It has been used [25] to generate meshes for multiply-connected polygonal domains and has been long known to provide the medial axis of polygonal shapes <ref> [12] </ref> that serve as a basis for efficient shape 8 (a) 2 point sites (b) 1 point and 1 line site (c) the point site is an end point of the line site representation schemes [17]. <p> This limited the occurrence of redundant edges in each representation. 3.2 Computing the Voronoi Diagram and Extracting Skeletons Given the vertices for a polygonal approximation as determined above, we computed the Voronoi diagram using the algorithm described earlier in Section 2. The medial axis <ref> [12] </ref> of a polygonal shape can be derived from its Voronoi diagram by deleting those edges that arise from concave vertices of the polygon (see Section 2.) The data structure created to store Voronoi edges contained the information required to identify these edges.

Reference-contexts: In particular, preserving important properties such as connectivity and Euclidean metrics have been difficult to achieve in the discrete world. Previous algorithms (and implementations) that have been developed can be classified <ref> [13, 23] </ref> into three distinct groups: (1) Topological thinning, (2) Medial Axis extraction from a distance map, and (3) Analytic computation of a skeleton based on an approximation of the object contour. Topological Thinning. <p> However, algorithms that compute correct Euclidean distance maps do exist [4]. Skeletonization algorithms using quasi-Euclidean and Euclidean maps follow ridges in the distance map to construct a skeleton. However, the problem with these methods are that connectivity is not guaranteed <ref> [13] </ref>. Analytic computation of symmetric axes. The third method involves computation of symmetric axes by a direct analytical method based on polygonal approximation of a shape. Early 5 work using this approach was by Montanari [21] who solved a system of linear equations to compute loci of equidistant points. <p> The quality of the resulting skeletons is critically dependent on the metric used to derive the distance map.

While methods to compute Euclidean [4] or quasi-Euclidean [22] distance maps exist, these methods do not guarantee connectivity.

More recently, new skeletonization algorithms [23], [13] have appeared in the literature that are marked improvements over the traditional techniques described above. In the sequel, we briefly describe these methods, and compare them with our approach. In [23], the authors compute the Voronoi diagram of the set of points along the boundary of an object shape. <p> Polygons are defined in terms of line segments, and are therefore well defined at every point p (x; y) 2 R 2 along the boundary. This overcomes the drawbacks of discretizing the bounding contour as in [23]. The authors of <ref> [13] </ref> employ the snake model (an active contour model), to compute skeletons. In their technique, initial control points are defined for the snake at curvature extrema of a shape's bounding contour. The dynamic grassfire is then simulated by snake propagation.

Reference-contexts: In our implementation, we used the zero crossings obtained from an image filtered with a Laplacian of a Gaussian <ref> [14] </ref>, to obtain a bounding contour. The advantage of this technique is that it guarantees closed contours, which ensures that a contour tracing algorithm such as chain coding will converge quickly.

Reference-contexts: The basis of our approach is the application of a algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of a polygon <ref> [16] </ref>. Our skeletonization algorithm retains the advantages of Voronoi diagrams described in the previous section, (connectivity, Euclidean metrics and high accuracy). This approach is thus a marked improvement over traditional skeletonization methods previously used in character recognition studies. <p> Assumptions about points being in general position are unnecessary. Unlike most geometric algorithms, special cases such as cocircularity of greater than three points or colinearity of more than two points are handled elegantly <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> Finally, we discuss performance and recognition results in Section 4 and summarize our study in Section 5. 2 The Voronoi Diagram In this section, we provide a brief description of our Voronoi diagram algorithm. For greater details of the algorithm and the proofs the reader is directed to <ref> [16] </ref>. The Voronoi diagram of a set of sites in two dimensions [28] is the partition of the plane into regions; each region i containing the set of points in the plane closest to the site i. <p> We believe that our algorithm fills this void. (See <ref> [16] </ref> for a discussion of previous work on Voronoi diagrams.) 2.1 Preliminaries In this section, we will introduce some definitions and notation. Definitions 1 through 8 pertain to the definition of polygonal domains and Voronoi diagrams and are taken from [24]. <p> The point of intersection x t1 is an intermediate point along B (e i ; e j ). See Figure 4. It is easy to prove <ref> [16] </ref> that this procedure is guaranteed not to overshoot the Voronoi vertex; namely, the open interval of the bisector B (e i ; e j ) between the points x 0 and x t1 contains no Voronoi vertex.

Finally, our skeletonization algorithm makes it easy to extract structural information such as end-points and junctions that are used in many syntactic recognition schemes.

Reference-contexts: The third method involves computation of symmetric axes by a direct analytical method based on polygonal approximation of a shape. Early 5 work using this approach was by Montanari [21] who solved a system of linear equations to compute loci of equidistant points. The Voronoi diagram <ref> [28] </ref> is a useful geometric structure which contains complete planar proximity information for a set of points [1]. This allows for simplified computation of a distance map directly from the Voronoi diagram. Furthermore, the Voronoi diagram of boundary line segments of a polygon is closely associated to its medial axis. <p> For greater details of the algorithm and the proofs the reader is directed to [16]. The Voronoi diagram of a set of sites in two dimensions <ref> [28] </ref> is the partition of the plane into regions; each region i containing the set of points in the plane closest to the site i. In the most common case which has been exhaustively researched [28] in the past decade, the sites under consideration are points in the plane. <p> The Voronoi diagram of a set of sites in two dimensions <ref> [28] </ref> is the partition of the plane into regions; each region i containing the set of points in the plane closest to the site i. In the most common case which has been exhaustively researched [28] in the past decade, the sites under consideration are points in the plane. In this case, edges of the diagram are straight line segments that are perpendicular bisectors of pairs of sites. Optimal algorithms as well as robust implementations have been devised for this version of the problem.

Reference-contexts: These include the last two methods described above, a structural technique that extracts features from the contours of characters, and a statistical approach. The combined system (tested on the same database) reported a correct classification rate of 93:05%, but had a zero substitution rate to achieve 100% reliability. Srihari <ref> [29] </ref>, presents several different approaches ranging from stroke based recognizers to structural contour based chain code classifiers. The classifiers were based on different methodologies: statistical, structural, and syntactic.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, more reliable methods need to be found before human performance in recognizing characters can be matched.

Of these steps, methods of feature extraction have received the largest amount of research and development. <p> Contours and skeletons can complement each other as feature descriptors for character recognition. A particularly good discussion of the relative merits and demerits of using skeletons versus contours in character recognition is given in <ref> [30] </ref> and [31], where a system is built that combines the powers of both representations. Another important disadvantage of skeletons is that some skeletonization algorithms introduce distortions of their own (sometimes known as noise spurs.).

The steps involved in most character recognition systems can be broadly classified into preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Of these steps, methods of feature extraction have received the largest amount of research and development. <p> Part (a) of this problem remains open. That existing character recognition systems have yet to match human performance, can in part be ascribed to the intractable nature of defining "distinctive characteristics" for character patterns. In <ref> [31] </ref>, a broad taxonomy of feature extraction approaches are discussed. These include global analysis (techniques such as template matching, measurement densities of points, moments and mathematical transforms) and structural analysis (methods that extract loops, endpoints, junctions and arcs from the contour or skeleton of a character). <p> In the context of character recognition, skeletons have an added advantage in that they provide a thin line representation similar to human handwriting. This allows for a more intuitive design of recognition algorithms <ref> [31] </ref>. Another important feature exhibited by skeletons is that their compact thin line representation is invariant to minor distortions, which allows for some measure of invariance to differences in individual writing style. <p> Contours and skeletons can complement each other as feature descriptors for character recognition. A particularly good discussion of the relative merits and demerits of using skeletons versus contours in character recognition is given in [30] and <ref> [31] </ref>, where a system is built that combines the powers of both representations. Another important disadvantage of skeletons is that some skeletonization algorithms introduce distortions of their own (sometimes known as noise spurs.). <p> Both of the last two methods were tested on the same database (US ZIP code database of CENPARMI (Concordia University); the training and testing sets consisted of 4000 and 2000 numerals respectively. Correct classification rates of 86:05% [18] and 93:1% [10] were observed. In <ref> [31] </ref>, a multi-expert system is described which combines the results of four techniques. These include the last two methods described above, a structural technique that extracts features from the contours of characters, and a statistical approach.
