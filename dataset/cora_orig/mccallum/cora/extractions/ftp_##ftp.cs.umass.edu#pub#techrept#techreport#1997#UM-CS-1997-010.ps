Abstract: Difficult real-time AI problems require a means for expressing multi-dimensional and dynamic goal criteria and a principled model for satisficing to best meet the criteria. In the context of the Design-to-Criteria task scheduling paradigm, we define a new general client specification metaphor for describing such complex goal criteria or utility attributes, and couple it with a principled evaluation model for using the criteria. The criteria specification and corresponding evaluation mechanism are used throughout the Design-to-Criteria scheduling process to focus scheduling activities on solutions and partial solutions that are most likely to meet the criteria, i.e., to result in the focused production of custom satisficing schedules. Examples of the power of the approach at reducing the complexity of the scheduling task and designing custom satisficing schedules, are shown.

Reference-contexts: Ubiquitous satisficing in the scheduler is based on a new, inexpensive to compute, general approach to satisficing evaluation coupled with a new domain independent client criteria specification metaphor. To ground further discussion consider the sample information gathering task structure, written in the TMS <ref> [1] </ref> language, shown in Figure 1. The task structure models multiple different approaches for gathering information about WordPerfect via the WWW. A set of satisficing schedules produced by the Design-to-Criteria scheduler using the evaluation mechanism and four different sets of evaluation criteria, is shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation approach and the criteria specification metaphor are general and can be applied to other applications and domains. Future work in Design-to-Criteria revolves around refining the interface between the scheduler and other complex AI components and/or humans. Interactive negotiation <ref> [2] </ref> between the client and the scheduler could control and refine satisficing activities as they happen.
