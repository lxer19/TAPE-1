Abstract: Two projected methods have been proposed to deal with the two main difficulties of the numerical solution of incompressible Stokes problems. While one method enforces the null-divergency condition through a projection [1], the other [4] projects the solution to satisfy boundary conditions. After summarizing these two techniques, the present report shows how to combine both into an accurate, efficient and simple generalized Stokes solver for large scale computations with a variety of complex and realistic boundary conditions. Preconditioning of the resulting projected system is handled by using specially designed matrices that share the same range and null space as the Boundary Condition (BC) projector Q and so commute with Q. The same idea can of course be applied to the single BC projection method introduced in [4], where the problem was left unsolved. One problem in implementing the double projection method concerns the rank-deficiencies introduced by the projector Q. In this paper we show how to efficiently compute the null-divergence (ND) projector P in presence of such rank deficiencies as well as the ones naturally found in CFD problems.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. In <ref> [1] </ref> a projection algorithm was proposed and analyzed for solving generalized Stokes problems " B 0 u ! 0 (1) where B 2 &lt; qfin is arbitrary and A 2 &lt; nfin is symmetric and positive definite on null (B), the kernel of B. <p> Then ~u 2 null (B), i.e., B ~u = 0. Furthermore, setting p = (B T ) y (f A~u) implies A~u + B T p = A~u + B y Bf B y BA~u = P f + B y Bf: This shows <ref> [1] </ref>: Theorem 2.1. Let A 2 &lt; nfin and B 2 &lt; qfin be arbitrary, and P = I B y B. <p> If (u; p) is defined by (6)-(8), then (u; p) solves the BC projected system (4). Proof. Following the proof given in <ref> [1] </ref> and using the definition of P , Q 0 BQu = 0 and P u = u hold. From the commutativity of Q and P , we also have Qu = u. Clearly the definition of p also gives Q 0 p = p. <p> Currently this scheme only works for nonperiodic boundary conditions. The work in Section 6 explains why this happens, and shows how to handle the periodic boundary condition case. First recall a result from <ref> [1] </ref>: Proposition 8.1. Let Q be an orthogonal projector, and M be invertible. Then (QM Q) y = QM 1 Q if and only if null (Q) is M -invariant. Another result that will be useful is: Proposition 8.2. Let Q be an orthogonal projector, and M be symmetric.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, if the symmetric part of A is positive definite then so is the symmetric part of P AP ; this property is important to assure convergence of many CG-like methods <ref> [2] </ref>. 3. Review of the BC Projected System. This section simply reviews the BC projection method first introduced in [4]. The idea is not to put the boundary conditions into the finite element function basis but rather to compute an orthogonal projector onto the space of vectors that satisfy them.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 briefly reviews the properties of the ND projection method. Although B need not be full rank, computing the projector P would require a QR factorization with column pivoting in presence of general rank deficiencies (see <ref> [3] </ref>). This could be extremely costly in terms of memory requirements, given the sizes of industrial CFD applications; meshes of O (10 5 ) to O (10 6 ) nodes are typical at Electricite de France (EDF).

Reference-contexts: Some rank deficiencies occur naturally in incompressible CFD computations while others arise from the coupling of the ND projection P with the ingenious BC projector Q (see <ref> [4] </ref>). This method enforces boundary condition by projecting an unconstrained solution into the space satisfying the boundary conditions. The projector Q need not be formed since it is easily derived and implicitly defined from the finite element basis. <p> Review of the BC Projected System. This section simply reviews the BC projection method first introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>. The idea is not to put the boundary conditions into the finite element function basis but rather to compute an orthogonal projector onto the space of vectors that satisfy them.

Reference-contexts: Testing within the large scale industrial CFD solver N3S has shown that the Cholesky factorization of ~ B ~ B T is most efficient when using a minimum degree ordering, a symbolic factorization and a supernodal numerical factorization algorithm, as shown in <ref> [5] </ref>. The overhead of seting up the Cholesky factorization is marginal since ~ B ~ B T (and therefore P ) is time independent. The simplicity and flexibility of the projector Q has two other distinct advantages. <p> When a Uzawa type scheme is applied to (12)-(13), a system with coefficient matrix BM 1 B T occurs. If M is the lumped mass matrix, then it is diagonal and direct methods can be applied to solve the Uzawa system effectively (see <ref> [5] </ref>).
