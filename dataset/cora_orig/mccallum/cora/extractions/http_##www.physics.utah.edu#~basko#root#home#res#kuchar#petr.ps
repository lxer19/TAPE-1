Abstract: The Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric massive thin shells in the general relativity is studied. Two different constraint dynamical systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems are found. New variables are used, which among other things simplify the complicated system a great deal. The systems are reduced to presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 , lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase spaces complicate the line of reasoning. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2 is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . Some consequences for the recent extensions of the shell dynamics through the singularity are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the gauge invariance is an issue, because a gauge fixation leads much more easily to gauge-dependent results in quantum gravity than, say, in the Yang-Mills field theory. This has to do with the so-called problem of time <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. The term `semi-classical thinking' is to express uneasiness about the extensions to the gravidynamics of the naive assumption that every dynamics is a theory of motion of some objects in some spacetime (cf. `covariant quantization' [3], string theory [4], or `effective field theory' [5]).

The way from a dynamical equation to a Hamiltonian principle is non-unique and it is unclear how much the final quantum results depend on a particular guess.

The way from a dynamical equation to a Hamiltonian principle is non-unique and it is unclear how much the final quantum results depend on a particular guess. Some kind of uniqueness has been shown in Ref. [9], but this is not yet completely reassuring, as we shall also see in the present paper. 2. The great simplicity of the super-Hamiltonian is achieved by a very special choice of variables: they are the coordinates of the shell in the subspacetime at one side of the shell. <p> There is, of course, a strong motivation for the Warsaw approach: this is the etremely simple form of its action. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we shall briefly collect the results of Refs. <ref> [9] </ref> and [11] that will be needed, so that the paper becomes self-contained. New is the systematic use of the Kruskal coordinates and more or less complete description of the symmetries that the systems admit. <p> research may clarify the point. 2 Description of the shell dynamics In this section, we briefly collect and round off some results scattered in literature making so the paper self-contained. 2.1 The shell spacetime A thin-shell spacetime solution of Einstein equations will be described in this subsection following closely Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider two Kruskal spacetimes M 1 and M 2 with Schwarzschild masses E 1 and E 2 . Let 1 be a timelike hypersurface in M 1 4 and 2 be one in M 2 . <p> The spacetime around the shell already satisfies the Einstein equations; thus, the only non-trivial equation still to be satisfied is the jump condition, the so-called Israel equation [12]. It implies (for a derivation, see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>) the following two equations for the embedding functions T * (s) and R (s) of the shell in M * , where * is a sign, * = 1 and s is the proper time along the radial generators of the surface. <p> We stress that the four possibilities are unambiguous (see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>): for each (scattering) shell spacetime, only one of these is realized in both subspacetimes M simultaneously. 2.2 Warsaw approach In this subsection, we describe a short-cut approach (cf. e.g. [7] and [9]) to the shell dynamics. <p> We stress that the four possibilities are unambiguous (see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>): for each (scattering) shell spacetime, only one of these is realized in both subspacetimes M simultaneously. 2.2 Warsaw approach In this subsection, we describe a short-cut approach (cf. e.g. [7] and [9]) to the shell dynamics. The first step of the approach is that only a subclass of the shell spacetimes is selected from all spherically symmetric shell spacetimes as described in the previous subsection, by fixing the value, E, say, of the Schwarzschild mass E in their internal subspacetimes. <p> Then the spacetime M 1 is a fixed, complete Kruskal spacetime and each shell spacetime defines a trajectory 1 in it. This trajectory satisfies Eq. (1) and (3) with * = 1. In Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> a proof is given that each such trajectory belongs to a unique shell spacetime: the condition that the shell spacetime satisfies the full set of Einstein equations determines the mass E + of the right subspacetime M + and the trajectory R + (t), T + (t) in it up <p> In this sense, the shell dynamics can be reduced to a dynamics of a particle-like object on a fixed two-dimensional spacetime M 1 . In Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>, the corresponding variational principle was shown to be uniquely determined (up to a coordinate-dependent factor in front of the super-Hamiltonian) if the super-Hamiltonian was required to be at most quadratic in momenta, and the value of the momentum conserved due to the time-shift symmetry to be the negative of the <p> Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> contains a proof that the variation principle (4) implies the radial equation (1) and the time equation (3) with * = 1. The time equation (3) with * = +1 must be added by hand. <p> dt (P U _ U + P V _ V N C 1 ); (9) where C 1 = 2 (2E) 2 + 2 W (U P U V P V ) 2 Our definitions (5), (10) and (6) of C 1 and W differ from those given in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> by the factor F so that the super-Hamiltonian C 1 and the potential W are smooth everywhere.
