Abstract: In this work we define a hybrid algorithm for approximating zeros of the nonlinear systems F (x) = 0, where F : IR n ! IR n is continuously differentiable. We are concerned with the possibility that n may be large and the Jacobian F 0 (x) sparse and singular. Trust region globalization methods are known to be robust and can be applied successfully to obtain global convergence results under rather weak hypotheses. However, these algorithms can be expensive, especially for large problems, if the trust region radius needs to be reduced quite often before an acceptable step is obtained. Exploiting the convex structure of the local model subproblem, we propose a hybrid algorithm that uses both trust region and linesearch globalization strategies. It solves, once and not accurately, a local model to obtain a search direction and then uses linesearch techniques to obtain an acceptable steplength . We demonstrate, under rather weak hypotheses, that the algorithm is globally convergent and that the sequence of residuals converges to zero. Moreover, under standard assumptions of Newton's method theory, we prove that the rate of convergence is q-superlinear. Furthermore, q-quadratic convergence can be obtained by requiring sufficient accuracy in the solution of the local model trust region subproblem. Introduction. In this paper we consider the problem of solving the nonlinear system of equa
