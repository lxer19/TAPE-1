In the synthetic stage, the text of the abstract is produced. Several factors influence the process of summarizing and the information to be included in the abstract <ref> [Cremmins, 1982, Spark Jones and Endres-Niggemeyer, 1995] </ref>. Sparck Jones and Endres-Niggemeyer categorize these factors as: Input factors : characteristics of the input material such as form and type of the input text (e.g. research papers promote informative abstracts and proceedings of conferences and documents covering several subjects promote indicative abstracts). <p> The objective of the abstracting organization also influences the selection of information. For example, chemical abstracting services would probably report only the chemical information that appear in a biochemical work [Borko and Bernier, 1975]. As far as the overall procedure is concerned, Cremmins <ref> [Cremmins, 1982] </ref> proposes a three stage analytical reading procedure: the retrieval reading stage responsible for the selection of relevant information the creative reading stage in which the information is organized and a draft written and finally the critical reading stage in which the draft is edited for unity and conciseness. <p> It was argued that human abstractors rely on cue words, titles and sub-titles and indicative phrases in order to identify relevant information <ref> [Cremmins, 1982] </ref>. Several studies were carried with professional abstractors in order to determine how they produce an abstract. The plans and strategies that professional abstractors follow in their natural environment were investigated by introspection and case-based studies [Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1991, Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1995].

Reference-contexts: Natural Sciences and Social Sciences abstracts have different structure.

Structured abstracts <ref> [Hartley et al., 1996] </ref> have a paragraph structure each being characterized by the use of sub-headings signaling their information. They are used in medicine and seem to be more useful than standard abstracts in the search for information.

How is the knowledge used? 5 Automatic Abstracting Two approaches are generally considered in automatic abstracting: the statistical and the understand and generate approaches <ref> [Johnson, 1995] </ref>. The statistical approach is concerned with the problem of extracting the salient information of the text using word frequency and term distribution.

Liddy's model includes three typical levels of information. The most representative level, called the Prototypical Structure, includes the information categories: Subjects, Purpose, Conclusions, Methods, References and Hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: The identification of text positions which carry rich semantic infor 4 mation continues to be investigated nowadays <ref> [Lin and Hovy, 1997] </ref>. In the statistical approach, the synthetic stage consists of the concatenation of the extracted sentences, so the result is not an abstract but an extract of the original text. This often produces an abstract of poor quality lacking cohesion and coherence.

Reference-contexts: As far as content selection is concerned, the type of abstract provides the basis for the inclusion of material. An indicative abstract should include information on purpose and methodology and an 3 informative abstract should include information on purpose, methodology, results and conclusions <ref> [Russell, 1988] </ref>. An input factor to consider is the information brought by the author. Writers use linguistics features to stress their main points; expressions like "it is necessary", "it is important" are cues that guide the abstractors in the selection of information.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Abstracts are pragmatic texts that have been studied in Computational Linguistics since the 1960s. Our own interest in abstracts started in 1994, when we studied automatic analysis of abstracts in Portuguese <ref> [Saggion, 1995] </ref>. We are now interested in the process of producing abstracts from scientific and technical articles. Our objective is to produce them automatically using Natural Language Generation theories and techniques which have been until now practically ignored in automatic abstracting.
