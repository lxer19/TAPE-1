Abstract: In this paper, we compare four distributed connection admission control schemes in cellular networks where the first two schemes are to keep the hand-off dropping probability below a target value, the third scheme is to guarantee no hand-off drops through a per-connection bandwidth reservation, and the fourth scheme uses another type of per-connection bandwidth reservation. The first scheme predicts the bandwidth required to handle hand-offs by estimating possible hand-offs from adjacent cells, then performs the admission control for each newly-requested connection. On the other hand, the second scheme predicts the total required bandwidth in the current cell by estimating both incoming and outgoing hand-offs at each cell. The third scheme requires the set of cells which the mobile with a newly-requested connection will traverse, and reserves bandwidth for each connection in each of those cells. The fourth scheme reserves bandwidth for each connection in the predicted next cell of a mobile. We adopt the history-based mobility estimation for the first two schemes. Using extensive simulations, the four schemes are compared quantitatively in terms of (1) important performance measures such as the hand-off dropping probability, connection-blocking probability, and bandwidth utilization, (2) dependency on the design parameters, (3) dependency on the mobility estimation accuracy, and (4) complexity. The simulation results indicate that the first scheme is the most desirable in the sense that it achieves reasonably good performance while requiring much less memory and computation than the other three schemes.

Reference-contexts: Limiting P HD below P HD;target is referred to as the design goal throughout this paper. Both schemes are based on the estimation of hand-offs that may occur in a specific time window. First, using the scheme proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> (referred to as CHOI), the base station (BS) of a cell calculates the required bandwidth to be reserved for anticipated hand-offs from adjacent cells upon arrival of a new connection request. <p> For simplicity, BSs are assumed to be fully-connected so that they communicate with each other through the wired links. However, this assumption is not always required as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, and won't affect the results in this paper. Under this assumption, the admission control considered in this paper can be performed by each BS, which receives a new connection request from a mobile in its cell. <p> However, for effective admission control with our design goal, it is necessary to have a good mobility-estimation scheme. We describe here the mobility-estimation scheme <ref> [1] </ref> that is 2 This is the cell A's (or its base station's) view. 3 Hence, we will use the terms "connection" and "mobile" inter changeably throughout the paper. 2 based on a history of hand-offs observed in each cell. <p> This scheme might not produce very accurate mobility estimation due to its dependency on the observation, but is feasible in practice, and was found to work well with CHOI <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 Hand-Off Estimation Functions We now explain the scheme to estimate and predict mobility. This scheme will be executed by the BS of each cell in a distributed manner. <p> 0 P 0&lt;t soj &lt;1 F HOE (t o ; prev; next 0 ; t soj ) ; where A 0 is the set of neighbor cells' indices of cell 0. 4 Admission Control CHOI with Estimation of Incoming Hand-offs Only We first describe the admission control scheme CHOI in <ref> [1] </ref> to keep P HD below P HD;target by utilizing the hand-off estimation function described thus far. 4.1 Target Reservation Bandwidth This approach is based on the estimated mobility during the time window [t o ; t o + T est ], where t o is the current time. <p> Otherwise, the continuous connection admissions in a cell may result in continuous hand-off drops in adjacent cells, thus violating the design goal, as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>. Note that B r;i is a time-varying function, and updated upon admission test. <p> This uneven traffic load can affect the performance evaluation of the four schemes, hence making it difficult to comprehend their operations correctly. So, we connected two border cells (i.e., cells &lt;1&gt; to &lt;10&gt;) artificially so that the cellular system forms a ring architecture as was assumed in <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. The parameters used include: P HD;target = 0:01; for the mobility estimation of CHOI and NAG, N quad = 100 (unless stated otherwise), T int = 1, N win days = 0, and w 0 = 1; for CHOI, T start = 1 (second). <p> CHOI and NAG were claimed to be superior to the conventional static bandwidth reservation scheme in <ref> [1] </ref> and [6], respectively, while showing that the static reservation scheme is unable to achieve the design goal. 7.2.1 Comparison of CHOI, AG, and BHARG load increases for the voice ratio R vo = 0:5 and 1:0.

Reference-contexts: It is generally impossible to know a mobile's direction in advance. As described in <ref> [2] </ref>, the route guidance system of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can be used to predict the mobiles' path/direction with a good accuracy, and might be used to predict the mobility specification.

Reference-contexts: It will be shown that BHARG is still costly compared to the first two schemes due to its per-connection bandwidth reservation requirement. There is one more scheme that limits P HD below a target <ref> [3] </ref>. The scheme uses the "shadow cluster" concept to estimate future resource requirements and perform admission control to limit P HD , in which the shadow cluster is a set of cells around a mobile.

Reference-contexts: The basic concept of this scheme was proposed in [8] assuming the availability of such information. We will show how costly it is to make the hand-off dropping probability zero even under this impractical assumption. The last admission-control scheme (referred to as BHARG) is based on per-connection bandwidth reservation <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. This scheme does not have any specific design goal, unlike the other three schemes described above. The next cell each mobile will move into is predicted, and its per-connection bandwidth is reserved in the cell. By doing this, it is possible to reduce P CB to almost zero. <p> The next cell each mobile will move into is predicted, and its per-connection bandwidth is reserved in the cell. By doing this, it is possible to reduce P CB to almost zero. In fact, the authors of <ref> [4] </ref> proposed to use this per-connection bandwidth and admission control when the next cell of a mobile can be predicted, and to use a variant of NAG when it is not. <p> Described here is more generalized than the original scheme in the sense that heterogeneous connections (in terms of connection bandwidths) are supported. The authors of <ref> [4] </ref> also presented another generalized version of the original scheme with a number of connection bandwidths. <p> The key aspect of this scheme is how to predict the next cell of a mobile, and it was proposed for indoor mobile computing environments <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. We assume here that a perfect next-cell estimator, which informs the BS whether a mobile is terminating its connection in the current cell or moving into an adjacent cell with the connection, is available to evaluate the performance of per-connection bandwidth reservation.

Reference-contexts: Using this estimation, one can compute the bandwidth required to handle the hand-offs that are predicted to occur within a specific time window. It also adaptively controls the time window size depending on the observed hand-off dropping events. In the second scheme proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> (referred to as NAG), the BS considers not only incoming hand-offs from adjacent cells, but also outgoing hand-offs into adjacent cells from the current cell. The BS then calculates the total required bandwidth in its cell for both handed-off and existing connections. <p> If all the tests are positive, the connection is admitted. 5 Admission Control NAG with Estimation of Incoming and Outgoing Hand-Offs We now describe the distributed admission control scheme (referred to as NAG), originally proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, which utilizes the cell-specific history-based mobility estimation. Described here is more generalized than the original scheme in the sense that heterogeneous connections (in terms of connection bandwidths) are supported. The authors of [4] also presented another generalized version of the original scheme with a number of connection bandwidths. <p> This uneven traffic load can affect the performance evaluation of the four schemes, hence making it difficult to comprehend their operations correctly.

Reference-contexts: Connection C 0;j 's extant sojourn time, T ext soj (C 0;j ), is the time elapsed since the active mobile with connection C 0;j entered the current cell. Using Bayes' theorem <ref> [7] </ref>, the hand-off probability p h (C 0;j ! next) at time t o is calculated by Eq. (3), where prev (C 0;j ) is the cell in which C 0;j resided before entering the current cell and A i is the set of indices of cell i's neighboring cells. <p> Using the Central Limit Theorem <ref> [7] </ref>, this can be approximated to have a Gaussian distribution as: P r B T est ;0 (k) G (m B;0 ; B;0 ); (10) where the mean m B;0 = i2A 0 j2C i X b (C 0;j )p s (C 0;j ); and the variance B;0 = i2A 0

Reference-contexts: Practically, it is impossible to know these cells in advance during the admission-control phase. The basic concept of this scheme was proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> assuming the availability of such information. We will show how costly it is to make the hand-off dropping probability zero even under this impractical assumption. The last admission-control scheme (referred to as BHARG) is based on per-connection bandwidth reservation [4, 5]. <p> So, this admission scheme involves per-connection bandwidth reservation in each cell. This per-connection reservation and the corresponding admission control were proposed in the context of measurement-based admission control in <ref> [8] </ref>. For this scheme to work, each mobile should inform the wired network (or the corresponding BS) of the mobility specification that is composed of the cells the mobile will traverse during the lifetime of the requested connection. It is generally impossible to know a mobile's direction in advance. <p> So, it is practically impossible to know the exact mobility specification at the time of admission control. But, we describe the admission-control scheme assuming the availability of the mobility specification as in <ref> [8] </ref>. For the mobility specification M sp of a newly-requested connection, which consists of a set of cells, and its required bandwidth b new , admission control and per-connection bandwidth reservation are as follows: T1.
