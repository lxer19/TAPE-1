Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of decision-feedback multiuser detectors with coding for CDMA channels. A combined multiuser detection/soft-decision decoding scheme is proposed which allows total control over the reliability of decision-feedback mechanism. Its performance is compared to that of conventional detection and linear-decorrelation detection with soft-decision decoding. Simulation and analysis is undertaken for synchronous CDMA channels. It is found that the scheme works very well especially for weak users and when multiuser interference is large. However, strong users do not gain much with this scheme over a linear-decorrelation detector.

Reference-contexts: Several low-complexity, sub-optimum multiuser detectors have been proposed in recent years but most of the research done so far on multiuser detection has considered uncoded transmissions, with a few exceptions <ref> [1] </ref>. Error control coding, however is important in a noisy and interference limited environment to obtain satisfactory performance. A family of single-stage decision-feedback multiuser detectors (DFMD) has been proposed for asynchronous CDMA channels in [2]. In these detectors, users make decisions in the order of decreasing signal strength. <p> Note that many of the low-complexity detectors proposed in recent years can not easily be combined with true soft-decision decoding. Examples include the multistage detector proposed by Varanasi and Aazhang [3] which employs successive interference cancellation and the post-processing likelihood detector of Seshadri and Hoeher (see <ref> [1] </ref> for references). In this paper we investigate the performance of single-stage DFMD with convolutional coding and soft-decision Viterbi decoding (SDD) over synchronous CDMA channels in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Varying the depth of trellis truncation of the Viterbi decoder allows control over the reliability of decisions fed back.

Reference-contexts: Error control coding, however is important in a noisy and interference limited environment to obtain satisfactory performance. A family of single-stage decision-feedback multiuser detectors (DFMD) has been proposed for asynchronous CDMA channels in <ref> [2] </ref>. In these detectors, users make decisions in the order of decreasing signal strength. <p> A DFMD eliminates anti-causal MAI using zero-forcing filtering and attempts to cancel causal MAI using decision feedback. It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that the improvement in performance with a DFMD is appreciable over the LDD, especially when MAI is large. The detectors have a nearly ideal near-far resistance. Another desirable feature of these detectors is that their serial structure allows combining multiuser detection with soft-decision decoding for maximum benefit. <p> The single-stage decision-feedback multiuser detector proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> consists of an anticausal forward filter G (D) as a zero-forcing filter that eliminates multiuser interference from "future" symbols and a strictly causal feedback filter B (D) that attempts to cancel multiuser interference from "past" symbols. <p> The op timum forward and feedback filters that would maximize the ideal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the input to the decision devices are shown to be <ref> [2] </ref> G (D) = (F T (D 1 )) 1 ; B (D) = (F (D)diag (F o ))W (2) Note that G (D) is the whitening filter for the process v (D) and y (D) is the resulting whitened process y (D) = G (D)v (D) = F (D)W c <p> The detector proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> orders the users in decreasing symbol energy.
