Abstract: abduction algorithm employing caching of explana-tions performs better than a non-ATMS alternative even when pruning heuristics are used to find a relatively small number of good explanations. We also want to stress that although the AAA algorithm is incomplete compared to the SAA algorithm, this does not affect our comparison since on all the problems that we tested, the situation in which a most general unifier actually instantiates the datum of a node does not arise. ous work on focusing the ATMS on a subset of interesting environments [Forbus and de Kleer, 1988, Dressler and Farquhar, 1990]; however, this work was not in the context of general first-order abduction and did not specifically involve using focusing to perform beam search. Also, although [Dressler and Farquhar, 1990] has empirical results comparing focused ATMS performance with that of non-focused ATMS (thus demonstrating that limited search is better than complete search), there has been no previous work comparing limited search ATMS im In this paper, we have presented a new algorithm for first-order Horn-clause abduction called AAA. The AAA algorithm uses an ATMS to avoid redundant computation by caching and reusing partial explanations. By comparison, previous abduction algorithms are either less general or less efficient. Since computing all minimal explanations is intractable, we also developed a heuristic beam-search version of AAA, which computes a subset of the simplest explanations. In order to evaluate AAA and AAA/H, we performed a comprehensive set of experiments using a broad range of abduction problems from text understanding, plan recognition, and device diagnosis. The results conclusively demonstrate that our algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than an abduction algorithm which does not employ an ATMS.
