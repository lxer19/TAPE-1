Abstract: The Artificial Painter (AP) software is presented. The AP software uses a genetic algorithm in artistic design to evolve pictures. This can be done either with an automatic fitness evaluation, or through the interaction of the user, who, in this case, acts directly as evaluator, and choose the most aesthetic picture to reproduce among a whole population of pictures. Finally, a hybrid of the two evaluation techniques is proposed. The single picture is a product of receptive fields of neural network units in artificial life models. The units activation can be expressed by different mathematical formulae on a lower level invisible to the user, making the aesthetic evaluation a user defined evaluation of appropriate mathematical formulae, that express aesthetics in the world of pictures visible to the user.
