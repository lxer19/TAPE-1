Abstract: We are building a system called NetBill which is optimized for the selling and delivery of low-priced network goods. A customer, represented by a client computer, wishes to buy information from a merchants server. An account server (the NetBill server), maintains accounts for both customers and merchants, linked to conventional financial institutions. A NetBill transaction transfers information goods from merchant to customer, debiting the customers NetBill account and crediting the merchants account for the value of the goods. When necessary, funds in a customers NetBill account can be replenished from a bank or credit card; similarly, funds in a merchants NetBill account are made available by depositing them in the merchants bank account. NetBill acts as an aggregator to combine many small transactions into larger conventional transactions, amortizing conventional overhead fees. Abstract NetBill is a system for micropayments for information goods on the Internet. This paper presents the NetBill protocol and describes its security and transactional features. Among our key innovations are:

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows the relationships among parties in a NetBill transaction. 2.1. Transaction Objectives For a NetBill transaction, we have the following set of objectives. (Similar versions of objectives (a)(d) below can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>.) a) Only authorized customers can charge against a NetBill account. b) The customer and merchant must agree on the item to be purchased and the price to be charged. c) A customer can optionally protect her identity from merchants. d) Customers and merchants are provided with proof of transaction results

Reference-contexts: Pseudonyms Some customers want to disguise their identities. NetBill provides two pseudonym methods to protect the privacy of the customers identity: a per-transaction method that uses a unique pseudonym for each transaction, and a per-merchant method that uses a unique pseudonym for each customer-merchant pair. (See <ref> [3] </ref> for a full discussion of privacy protection with pseudonyms.) The per-merchant pseudonym is useful for customers who wish to maintain a consistent pseudonymous identity to qualify for frequent-buyer discounts. These pseudonym schemes are implemented by introducing a pseudonym-granting server, P, to create pseudonymous PKTGTs for the customer.

Reference-contexts: M fi C E CM (ProductID, Price (=0), RequestFlags, TID, Goods, CC (Goods)) associated with that User ID. This key pair is certified by NetBill, and is used for signatures and authentication within the system. (See <ref> [4] </ref> for a discussion of public key certification.) Section 3.4 showed how these signatures will be used in the payment phase of the protocol. However, our protocol also uses Kerberos tickets. <p> NetBill uses a key repository to optionally store customers private keys. These keys are encrypted by a symmetric key derived from a passphrase known only to the customer. 4.1.1. Key Validation and Revocation Cer tificates We use a public key certificate scheme (like that presented in <ref> [4] </ref>) to bind User IDs to keys, with NetBill as the certifying authority. NetBill generates a certificate when a customer first proves her identity and begins using NetBill.

Reference-contexts: T XY (Identity) A Kerberos ticket proving to Y that X is named by Identity, and establishing a session key XY shared between them. CC (Message) A cryptographic checksum of Message, using an algorithm such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) hash function pre sented in <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.2. The Price Request Phase This section assumes possession of tickets; the method for obtaining tickets is shown in Section 4. The Identity item may actually be a pseudonym, as shown in Section 4.2. E K (Message) Message, encrypted by a sym metric cipher using key K.

Reference-contexts: This is com-putationally efficient and allows any party to read the Message text without needing Xs public key. The clearsigned item implicitly includes a nonce. [Message] X-DSA Message, signed and times tamped by X using the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Message- X Message, encrypted for X using RSA public key cryptography. For computational efficiency, this is implemented by forming E K (Message), E X-PUB (K). The encrypted message implicitly includes a nonce. 1. C fi M T CM (Identity), E CM (Credentials, PRD, Bid, RequestFlags, TID) 2.

Reference-contexts: P fi C E K1 (K2, [-Pseudonym, M, Times tamp, K2-M ] P , [TrueIdentity, M, Pseudonym, Timestamp] P ) 3. C fi M [-Pseudonym, M, Timestamp, K2-M ] P 4. M fi C E K2 (T CM (Pseudonym), CM) 5. Credentials and Authorizations In <ref> [7] </ref>, Neuman presents a system of using restricted proxies for authorization. A restricted proxy is a ticket giving the bearer authority to perform certain operations named in the ticket. <p> In this way, merchants only sell to approved customers: those who can present a certain credential. This offers a solution for merchants who, for example, can restrict distribution of sensitive documents only to individuals whose credentials verify a need-to-know. 5.2. Access Control Mechanism As noted in <ref> [7] </ref>, proxies can implement access control. An account owner (such as a parent) may have a restriction on the account such that no purchases can be completed by a given customer (such as a child) without approval from an access control server.

Reference-contexts: The key K may be denoted as XY, meaning that it is known only to parties X and Y. The encrypted message implicitly includes a nonce. E X-PUB (Message) Message, encrypted in party Xs public key using the RSA cryp tosystem as presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. E X-PRI (Message) Message, encrypted in party Ys private key using RSA. [Message] X Message, clearsigned by X using RSA public key cryptography. Clearsigning is implemented by forming Message, Timestamp, E X-PRI (CC (Message, Timestamp)).

NetBill requires an efficient set of protocols to support price negotiation, goods delivery and payment. This paper outlines our protocols.

Reference-contexts: Instead of using public key cryptography for message authentication and encryption throughout the NetBill system, we use symmetric cryptography because it offers significant performance advantages. We use the public key cryptography infrastructure to alleviate problems with traditional symmetric-key Kerberos (see <ref> [12] </ref>): Kerberos uses a two-level ticket scheme; to authenticate oneself to a Kerberos service, one must obtain a service ticket, which establishes a shared symmetric session key between the client and server, and establishes that the Kerberos Ticket Granting Server believes the clients identity.

Reference-contexts: technique also protects the merchant by requiring the customer to pay and the payment to clear through the NetBill server before the customer gets the use of the goods. (A more general discussion of the role of certified delivery and atomicity in general for electronic commerce can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>.) Section 5.2 presents a solution for objective (h). Objective (i) is realized by encrypting communications between all pairs of parties and providing integrity checks on those messages. 3.1. Notation We use the following notation to denote cryptographic operations. X and Y always represent communicating parties.
