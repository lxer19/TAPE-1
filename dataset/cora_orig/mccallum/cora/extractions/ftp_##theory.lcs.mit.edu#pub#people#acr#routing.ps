Abstract: Bandwidth is a very valuable resource in wavelength division multiplexed optical networks. The problem of finding an optimal assignment of wavelengths to requests is of fundamental importance in bandwidth utilization. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem on fixed constant-size topologies. We combine this algorithm with ideas from Raghavan and Upfal [15] to obtain an optimal assignment of wavelengths on constant degree undirected trees. Mihail, Kaklamanis, and Rao [14] posed the following open question: what is the complexity of this problem on directed trees? We show that it is NP-complete both on binary and constant depth directed trees.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3 Coloring paths on directed trees of depth 3 is NP-complete. Proof. We reduce edge coloring to this problem. We use a stronger version of edge coloring where we assume the graph is k-regular (in fact, even for k = 3, i.e., cubic graphs, the problem is NP-complete <ref> [9] </ref>). Given a k-regular graph G, is 0 (G) = k? First, we construct the tree T essentially as in Theorem 2, but with undirected edges replaced by directed edges in both directions.

Reference-contexts: Though the IP has terms in the constraints which are linear in n, the optimizing function has only a constant number of variables. This means we can solve the IP exactly using Lenstra's polynomial-time algorithm for integer programs in fixed dimension <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 3 Constant Depth Trees For undirected trees of constant depth, the problem of coloring paths is known to be NP-complete. For directed trees, however, no hardness result was known before. We now give a reduction that shows that coloring paths on directed trees of depth 3 is NP-complete.

Notation. <p> This follows from an obvious reduction to edge coloring bipartite graphs <ref> [14] </ref>. 5 Fig. 2. Reduction to a Constant Depth Directed Tree 4 Constant Degree Trees First, we show that for undirected trees of constant degree, the problem of coloring paths is in P. Then, we show that for directed trees, this problem is NP-complete even for binary trees. <p> at all internal nodes, all the paths are from the left child to right child, the problem of Optical Routing on directed trees is still NP-complete. (iii) The problem of obtaining a better than 7L max =4 algorithm for binary trees or better than 15L max =8 for general trees <ref> [14] </ref> is still tantalizingly open.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it is interesting to study Optical Routing on fixed-size arbitrary topologies. Previous Work. Optical Routing has been studied in great detail on a number of different and fundamental topologies by Raghavan and Upfal <ref> [15] </ref>. 2 This problem is NP-complete for undirected trees by reduction from edge col-oring. They gave a 9=8-approximation algorithms for undirected trees and a 2-approximation algorithm for rings. They also present approximation algorithms for expanders, meshes, and bounded-degree graphs. <p> Our Results. We present an algorithm for Optical Routing on fixed constant-size topologies which has running time polynomial in the number of requests (Section 2). We combine this algorithm with ideas from Raghavan and Upfal <ref> [15] </ref> to obtain an optimal assignment of wavelengths on constant degree undirected trees (Section 4).
