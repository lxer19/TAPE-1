Title: Discriminating Mental Tasks Using EEG Represented by AR Models  
Author: Charles W. Anderson and Erik A. Stolz and Sanyogita Shamsunder 
Abstract: EEG signals are modeled using single-channel and multi-channel autoregressive (AR) techniques. The coefficients of these models are used to classify EEG data into one of two classes corresponding to the mental task the subjects are performing. A neural network is trained to perform the classification. When applying a trained network to test data, we find that the multivariate AR representation performs slightly better, resulting in an average classification accuracy of about 91%.

The signals were filtered to 0.1 - 100 Hz. Data was recorded for 10 seconds during each task and each task was repeated five times per session. Most subjects attended two such sessions recorded on separate weeks.
