Abstract: Technical Report CS-TR-94/6 May, 1994 Abstract We argue that the process of designing effective systems for case retrieval should not be divorced from the process of evaluation. Developing a suitable representation vocabulary for indices, and suitable mechanisms for case retrieval should proceed in an iterative fashion, guided by the joint application of sound AI principles, domain expertise, and empirical evaluation. We lay out the key components of a case retrieval system and suggest procedures for evaluating each component. We illustrate our claims using the MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data. Publishing Information A shorter version of this paper is to appear in Proceedings of the AAAI'94 Workshop on Case Based Reasoning, Seattle, Washington, August 1994.

Reference-contexts: In the near future, we plan to obtain an additional 10 years of data, allowing us to expand the case base to 10 000 cases (6Gb). Case retrieval in MetVUW Workbench is a process of comparing queries (sometimes called index probes <ref> (Domeshek, 1991) </ref>) against explicitly represented index labels. Queries identify particular features of the current situation that appear to be meteorologically significant. Index labels are representations of high-level features of the weather situation in the case. As far as possible, index labels are extracted automatically or semi-automatically from the raw data.

Reference-contexts: This heavy duty machinery was chosen so that the system can readily scale up to a very large case base. Case selection is efficient 1 We assume serial computer hardware. 3 because it employs a number of sophisticated indexing strategies provided by Postgres, including R-tree indexing of spatial data <ref> (Guttman, 1984) </ref>. Once a collection of past cases has been retrieved, they are passed to the similarity assessor, which uses a knowledge-intensive partial matching process to rank them according to how well they match the query. Those cases whose match quality falls below some threshold are discarded.

Reference-contexts: Detailed examination of particular past cases can also usefully guide analysis of the current situation <ref> (Hunter, 1989) </ref>. In the context of meteorological research, MetVUW Workbench is expected to open up a wealth of possibilities for empirical investigation. In the past, large-scale investigations have been impeded by the difficulty of rapidly identifying relevant data.

Reference-contexts: the efficiency of the entire retrieval system: if case selection retrieves many irrelevant cases, then similarity assessment will take much longer, because it must scan all of the cases that case selection returns. 5 Two standard evaluation metrics from the information retrieval literature are useful in evaluation of case selection <ref> (Jacobs, 1992) </ref>: * The precision of an information retrieval system is the percentage of items retrieved in response to a query that are good answers to the query. * The recall of an information retrieval system is the proportion of good answers to a query that the system retrieved, expressed as

Reference-contexts: Exactly how these assessments should trade off against one another is a difficult issue, and we are still experimenting with different alternatives. MetVUW Workbench currently employs a form of breadth-bounded depth-first search with successor ordering <ref> (Pearl, 1984) </ref> that appears to strike an appropriate balance. We enforce the following structural constraints on the possible sets of correspondences between low pressure regions of a query and a case. First, the relation that the correspondences define must be one-to-one.
