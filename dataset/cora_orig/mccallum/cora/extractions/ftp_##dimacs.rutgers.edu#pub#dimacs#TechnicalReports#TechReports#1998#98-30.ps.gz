Section 3 defines the local search heuristic that we analyze. Section 3.1 explains how to find an initial feasible solution. <p> In a capacitated problem, however, such an assignment may violate the capacity constraint. Fortunately, for the capacitated problems with splittable demands, given a set S of open facilities, an optimal assignment can be computed in polynomial time by solving an appropriately defined instance of the transportation problem <ref> [18] </ref>. Thus, for the capacitated variants with splittable demands, any solution is completely characterized by the set S of open facilities. For the capacitated problems with unsplittable demands, however, it is NP-hard to compute an optimal assignment for a given set S of open facilities. <p> For notational convenience, we sometimes drop the parameters S and/or when there is no ambiguity. Also recall that given a set S of open facilities, the corresponding optimal splittable assignment can be computed in polynomial time by a reduction to the transportation - 15 - problem <ref> [18] </ref>. Hence, the solution to the capacitated problem with splittable demands is entirely characterized by the set S of open facilities. <p> We then use Theorem 10.1 to obtain an unsplittable assignment 0 for S with shipping cost at most that of the splittable assignment for S. However, Theorem 10.1 requires the capacities of all facilities to be increased by a factor of at most two. If we assume, as in <ref> [18] </ref>, that a blowup in the capacity incurs a proportionate increase in the facility cost, then the facility cost for S in the unsplittable case is at most twice that in the splittable case.
