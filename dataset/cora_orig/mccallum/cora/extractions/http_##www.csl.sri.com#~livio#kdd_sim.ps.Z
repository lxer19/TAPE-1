Abstract: We introduce a new model for describing the behavior of complex interconnection networks in the presence of faults. With our model, it is possible to obtain the detailed behavior of a faulty telecommunication network by specifying some parameters that describe its physical characteristics. We describe our model, we show how it can be applied to study some real network management structures, and we give some experimental data to evaluate its relation to existing standard analytical models.

Reference-contexts: different and subsequent unusual conditions. 3.4 Fault Propagation Model As mentioned in the introduction, one of the most challenging aspects of performance estimation of NM systems is that the behavior of an unusual condition (or alarm) generated by a real system is very hard to model with standard analytical techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. It has been observed that in most cases faults occur in bursts because any change of the behavior of a single node of a complex network can perturb, and therefore may cause faults in, other nodes of the same network. <p> This phenomenon is known as fault correlation and is the cause of undesirable NM traffic. We create a fault propagation model allowing the capture of the complex interrelations of a real network <ref> [1] </ref> and therefore yielding a more realistic model of its behavior. Once a fault occurs in an NE, it will be propagated, according to a given probability function, to other NEs.
