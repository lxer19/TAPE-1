Abstract: An algorithmic paradigm for I DDQ measurement based analysis that target all two node bridging faults (BFs) in CMOS circuits is presented. In contrast to the pessimistic criteria used in our prior work, here we use the criteria for identifying I DDQ tests proposed in the literature by other researchers. Algorithms for simulation, diagnosis and I DDQ subset selection of BFs in combinational circuits as well as a simulation algorithm and a subset selection algorithm for sequential circuits are presented. In addition to showing the efficiency of the proposed algorithms our preliminary experimental results suggest that: (i) for combinational circuits, our heuristic for I DDQ subset selection is considerably better than a "QUIETEST-like heuristic" for the same problem; (ii) for combinational circuits, I DDQ test sets derived from randomly generated test sets are often considerably better than I DDQ test sets derived from stuck-at test sets; and (iii) for sequential circuits, I DDQ test sets derived from randomly gener ated test sets are comparable to I DDQ test sets derived from stuck-at test sets.

Reference-contexts: We are unaware of any fault simulation algorithms, even for a subset of BFs, in sequential circuits. Here we present an algorithm that targets all BFs, including those that involve internal nodes, in combinational as well as sequential circuits. I DDQ measurement based diagnosis of BFs is discussed in <ref> [2, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. The algorithm we present is a modification of the algorithm in [5] to include BFs involving internal nodes of the circuit. It is a simplification of the diagnosis algorithm in [7]. It is presented here primarily for the sake of completeness.

The stuck-at tests were generated using the stuck-at test generator provided with Octtools <ref> [15] </ref>. Only one random test set was used for the results presented in Table 6.

Reference-contexts: In our analysis algorithms we need to use properties of an input vector that identifies it to be an I DDQ test for a given BF.

Our analysis targets all BFs unlike work by others where a subset of the BFs are targeted [13, 14, 12]. <p> In presence of F =&lt; e; d &gt; there will be no conducting path from e to Gnd, hence no appreciable I DDQ . Thus v is not a test for fault F . We are going to use the following criteria from <ref> [17] </ref> to identify I DDQ tests for a BF between f 1 ; f 2 . <p> If a BF is not an NFBF then it is a FBF. In Fig. 1 &lt; a; c &gt; is a FBF and &lt; d; c &gt; is NFBF. For NFBF &lt; x; y &gt; the same criteria for v to be an I DDQ test as in <ref> [17] </ref> was used. However, for FBF &lt; x; y &gt; in addition to v (x) 6= v (y) an additional condition was imposed. This is explained with the help of an example that uses Fig. 1. Consider the fault &lt; a; c &gt;. <p> Let v 1 =&lt; a = 0; b = 1 &gt; and v 2 =&lt; a = 0; b = 0 &gt;. In the fault free case , for both v 1 ; v 2 a = 0 and c = 1. According to <ref> [17] </ref> both qualify as an I DDQ test for &lt; a; c &gt;. However, according to [3, 4, 6, 7] v 1 does not but v 2 qualifies as a test for &lt; a; c &gt;. v 1 was rejected because it leads to oscillation.
