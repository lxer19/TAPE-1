Title: Improvements on the Ant-System: Introducing the MAX MIN Ant System  
Author: Thomas Stutzle and Holger Hoos

Abstract: In this paper we present MAX MIN Ant System (MMAS) that improves on Ant System. MMAS is a general purpose heuristic algorithm based on a cooperative search paradigm that is applicable to the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. In the experiments we apply MMAS to symmetric and asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems. We describe in detail the improvements on Ant System, discuss the addition of local search to MMAS, and report on our computational results, showing that our system also improves over other variations of Ant System.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ant System (AS), introduced originally in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, is a cooperative search algorithm inspired by the behaviour of real ants, that are able to find good solutions to shortest path problems between food sources and their home colony. Ants usually communicate via pheromones, i.e. aromatic substances, that they may lay down in some quantity.

Reference-contexts: The behav-iour of ant colonies is imitated to some extent by AS by using simple agents, called ants, that may communicate among themselves via a mechanism inspired by the pheromone trails. This allows the application of this search metaphor to the solution of combinatorial optimization problems <ref> [3] </ref>. Here we present MMAS, an improvement over Ant System at hand of the application to symmetric and asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) contained in TSPLIB (ftp://ftp.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/pub/tsplib). fl Corresponding author The paper is organized as follows. <p> The parameters ff and fi determine the relative influence of the 1 For a more detailed description of the Ant System al gorithm the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 induced by normalization trail strength and the heuristic information. To keep track of the cities already visited, every ant maintains a tabu list, in which the partial tour is stored.

Reference-contexts: It can be noted that MMAS with additional trail smoothing (MMAS+sm) performs best. 6 In Table 4 we present the results obtained with MMAS for some problems of the First International Contest on Evolutionary Optimization <ref> [4] </ref>. We only present results for the maximum number of tour constructions. The parameter settings are = 0:99, ff; fi = 1:0, and m = n except for ftv170.atsp, where we chose m = n=2. In Table 3 we reproduced the results obtained with ACS in [6].

Reference-contexts: A major advantage of smoothing is that it makes MMAS more robust against premature convergence for a broader range of parameter values (especially ). In Table 2 we present the best average tour quality obtained with several extensions of AS, including Ant Colony System (ACS) <ref> [6] </ref>, the so far best improvement over AS. It can be noted that MMAS with additional trail smoothing (MMAS+sm) performs best. 6 In Table 4 we present the results obtained with MMAS for some problems of the First International Contest on Evolutionary Optimization [4]. <p> We only present results for the maximum number of tour constructions. The parameter settings are = 0:99, ff; fi = 1:0, and m = n except for ftv170.atsp, where we chose m = n=2. In Table 3 we reproduced the results obtained with ACS in <ref> [6] </ref>. With execption of the problems ftv170.atsp and d198.tsp, the average performance of the MMAS achieved over 25 independent runs is better and its standard deviations are generally smaller.

Reference-contexts: To characterize the amount of exploration AS still performs, the mean -branching factor can be used, for details see <ref> [7] </ref>. If the mean -branching factor is very low, practically no more new tours are build, thus leading to a stagnation of the search. 3 MAX MIN Ant System MMAS was inspired by some of our observations while experimenting with AS.

Reference-contexts: If this condition does not hold, we have the more general case of an asymmetric TSP (ATSP). TSP is a N P-hard optimization problem which has many applications and is extensively studied in the literature <ref> [8] </ref>. It also frequently serves to test new algorithmic ideas, one more reason to choose it here as an example application. To solve TSPs, AS uses pheromone trails t ij associated with each arc (i; j).
