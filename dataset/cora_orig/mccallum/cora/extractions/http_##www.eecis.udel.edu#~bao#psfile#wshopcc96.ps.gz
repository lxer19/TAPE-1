Abstract: Extended Abstract The major task of a network is to provide transmission service to different applications with diversified QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. Various QoS control schemes have been proposed and studied [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For each application, there is a functional relationship between the supported QoS and the resource needed. Given a limited amount of network resources, usually in terms of buffers and bandwidth, it is desirable to allocate as few resources as possible, as long as the amount of resources is enough to satisfy the requested QoS; while the rest of the resources can be used for other applications. Due to the increasing dynamics and unpredictability of traffic in current network applications, it is necessary to have dynamic resource management to adjust the relationship between the resources needed and the change of traffic characteristics over the lifetime of a transmission to ensure the twin objectives of QoS satisfaction and network efficiency. Meanwhile, many real-time network applications require specific end-to-end delay bound and loss ratio QoS. Thus, QoS control should try to provide accurate realization of QoS as close as possible to what is requested, not just to a certain degree. We adopt the approach of adjusting resource allocation of each flow to achieve the requested QoS. With this approach, a referenced amount of resources is allocated before the start of a transmission, and this amount is adjusted during the lifetime of the transmission based on a set of criteria such as QoS performance and resource utilization. The gain from dynamic resource adjustment is that for each flow, the average resource needed for ensuring requested QoS is smaller than that under static resource allocation, therefore more flows may be accommodated into the network. Here we introduce two dynamic resource management schemes to satisfy a diversified combination of delay bound and loss ratio requirements. In both schemes, the allocated buffer size and service rate for a flow are coordinated so that the admitted packets will be served before their deadlines. The main idea of buffer-directed QoS control is to achieve QoS by dynamically changing the allocated resources based on the observed QoS performance. Before the start of transmission, an upper loss ratio bound L u and a lower loss ratio bound L l are chosen according to the loss ratio requirement of this flow L (L l &lt; L &lt; L u ). The dynamic adjustment of resources intends to control the loss ratio performance to be within the [L l ; L u ] interval: if the loss ratio performance is higher than L u , more resources are allocated to this flow; if it is lower than L l , some allocated resources are released from this flow. The initial simulations and stochastic analysis show that the observed loss ratio is less likely to reach the boundaries of the [L l ; L u ] interval as time goes on. We call this phenomenon|the slowing down of the change of loss ratio|the waving effect. Generally, the waving effect makes the loss ratio performance less responsive to change in statistics as time goes on. Analysis also shows that due to the waving effect, the minimum loss
