Title: EMERGENT BEHAVIOUR IN CO-EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN  
Author: JOSIAH POON AND MARY LOU MAHER 
Address: Sydney NSW 2006 Australia  
Affiliation: Key Centre of Design Computing Department of Architectural and Design Science University of  
Abstract: An important aspect of creative design is the concept of emergence. Though emergence is important, its mechanism is either not well understood or it is limited to the domain of shapes. This deficiency can be compensated by considering definitions of emergent behaviour from the Artificial Life (ALife) research community. With these new insights, it is proposed that a computational technique, called evolving representations of design genes, can be extended to emergent behaviour. We demonstrate emergent be-haviour in a co-evolutionary model of design. This co-evolutionary approach to design allows a solution space (structure space) to evolve in response to a problem space (be-haviour space). Since the behaviour space is now an active participant, behaviour may emerge with new structures at the end of the design process. This paper hypothesizes that emergent behaviour can be identified using the same technique. The floor plan example of (Gero & Schnier 1995) is extended to demonstrate how behaviour can emerge in a co-evolutionary design process.

However, the definitions offered from the design community are usually applied to shape only. Hence, this paper attempts to borrow characteristics of emergence identified from other research communities, i.e. ALife community, to enhance our understanding of emergent beha-viour. <p> The expectation from this compare and contrast exercise aims to help us generalize emergence in design beyond emergent shape. 2.1. HOW IS EMERGENCE BEING DEFINED? The most notable definition on emergence offered by the design community comes from <ref> (Gero 1992) </ref>, which says A property that is only implicit, i.e. not represented explicitly, is said to be an emergent property if it can be made explicit. The context that Gero addresses is shape emergence. A process to discover emergent shapes is reported by Gero & Yan (1994). <p> EMERGENT BEHAVIOURS CORRELATE WITH GOALS It has been pointed out in section 4 that the formulation of functional requirements is to define expected behaviour, B e <ref> (Hybs & Gero 1992) </ref>, i.e. expected be EMERGENT BEHAVIOUR 11 haviour is derived from functions. Emergent behaviour must then be goal-oriented as well where this complex behaviour cannot emerge outside the context of a fitness function.

Reference-contexts: The evolution of each space is guided by the most recent population in the other space. This model is called co-evolution and provides the basis for a computational model of design exploration. The basis for co-evolution is a simple genetic algorithm <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref> where special consideration is given to the representation and application of the fitness function so that the problem definition can change in response to the current solution space. A computational implementation of co-evolutionary design is reported in (Maher & Poon 1995) and (Maher, Poon & Boulanger 1995). <p> In general, the methods of Gero & Schnier (1995) do not specify whether the evolving representation is structure or behaviour. In this example, the initial basic genes represent simple pen movements that we assume represent structure or shape. The example extends a basic GA <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref> by the incorporation of evolving genes. The solutions are represented as genotypes and the performances are measured by a constant fitness function. The evolution in Gero & Schnier (1995) example brings forth evolved structures.

Emergence Emergence is, very often, used and discussed by the design community without a proper definition, e.g. <ref> (Liu 1995) </ref>. The process which leads to emergence is largely unknown. The omission of a definition makes the development of a computational model for emergence difficult. ALife community is another research group which frequently makes reference to the terminology of emergence.
