Abstract: UNC Technical Report 95-005 A List-Priority Rendering Algorithm for Redisplaying Abstract Projected grid surfaces are a particularly interesting subset of bivariate parametric functions. Images generated using three-dimensional computer graphics methods and those resulting from ideal pin-hole cameras fall into this class. Often, a range image is provided in addition to the actual image, this may be in the form of a Z-buffer for synthetic images or stereo-disparity field for acquired images. In this research I report on an algorithm for computing the visible subset of a projected surface from any arbitrary view. This method has several important properties. It determines an occlusion-compatible paint order such that surfaces closest to the desired viewpoint are drawn last, thus overwriting any previously rendered surface. This painting order is determined independent of the range information. Also, facets of the image are drawn sequentially, taking advantage of local spatial coherency. This report also describes a method for the fast rendering of small triangles using a table driven approach.

More recently, improved algorithms for rendering arbitrary views of bivariate surfaces have been suggested by <ref> [Anderson82] </ref> and [Wang90]. All of these algorithms for displaying gridded surfaces compute a hidden-line solution instead of a hidden-surface solution as is common in other computer graphics applications. This seems reasonable since a hidden-line representation can provide important insights into a surfaces shape beyond what a smooth-shaded image can do.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this research is to develop a visibility algorithm for a related class of gridded surfaces, the projected grid surface. One of the earliest solutions to the gridded surface problem was given by Kubert, Szabo, and Guilieri <ref> [Kubert68] </ref>. Later, Wright enhanced Kuberts algorithm resulting in the familiar oating horizon algorithm, which is still commonly used today [Wright73].

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a back-to-front ordering requires no additional storage because the proper occlusion is handled by the drawing order in a way similar to the classic painters algorithm <ref> [Rogers85] </ref>.
