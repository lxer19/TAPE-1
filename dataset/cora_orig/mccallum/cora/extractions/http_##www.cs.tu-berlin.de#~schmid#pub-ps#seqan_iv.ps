Reference-contexts: For this reason the latter approach is preferred here. 2.3.2 Computational procedure Under these presuppositions the set of orthogonal variables can best be determined by applying a procedure which is known from metric multidimensional scaling <ref> (c.f. Ahrens, 1974, chap. 3.2.1) </ref>. As a first step, all predictors must be transformed such that the means of the transformed predictors are zero, Conceptual Systems and Predictive Variance 6 i.e. the means of the original predictors must be subtracted from the original predictor values. <p> Furthermore, let x i denote the i-th orthogonal variable and i = x i ' fix i . The set of orthogonal variables can then be found by solving the equation B fl x i = i x i (1) <ref> (c.f. Ahrens, 1974, chap. 3.2.1) </ref>. Different algorithms for solving such problems numerically are at hand. The algorithm mostly used in this context is described among others by Morrison (1967, chap. 7.4). Let p be the rank of B fl . <p> Young & Householder, 1938). In terms of multidimensional scaling, if there are n objects, one needs at most n 1 dimensions to represent the Euclidean distances between these objects. The i are proportional to the proportions of the generalized predictor variance explained by the corresponding orthogonal variable <ref> (c.f. Ahrens, 1974, chap. 3.2.1) </ref>. This allows the proportion of predictive variance to be computed directly. Let r i be the correlation coefficient between orthogonal variable x i and the outcome measure and ff the proportion of predictive variance.

Reference-contexts: A more adequate statistic can be developed if one refers to the variance of the predictors instead of the variance of the criterion, i.e. if one refers to the generalized predictor variance which is defined as the sum of the single predictor variances <ref> (cf. Anderson, 1958) </ref>. The predictive potential can then be conceptualized as the proportion of the generalized predictor variance which is predictive for the criterion. This statistic, which will be developed below, will be referred to as the proportion of predictive variance.

Reference-contexts: Current models in hci mainly address the problem of describing and simulating error-free interaction of expert users with a given software system <ref> (c.f. Baecker & Buxton, 1987, p. 178) </ref>. Prominent models are the GOMS (Goals Operations Methods Selection rules) of Card, Moran and Newell (1983), the Command Language Grammar of Moran (1981) and a model of user complexity by Kieras and Polson (1985).

Reference-contexts: The time for solving the task was restricted to 90 minutes. All inputs into the system were recorded in logfiles.

Since, in the study, the solution time was limited to 90 minutes, we operationalized performance as the number of correctly produced draft elements such as lines, circles or arcs.

Reference-contexts: For further development of models which describe the behavior of novice users, these results suggest that actions on the command level should be paid most attention to, i.e., the syntactic (Moran, 1981), the method <ref> (Card, Moran & Newell, 1983) </ref> or the device-representation (Kieras & Polson 1985) level seem most promising. For further interpretation of data, the results call for a closer look at the command level.

Reference-contexts: In this area it is important to determine aspects of users' interaction behavior which are predictive for performance quality, such as time of task execution or correctness of task solution (c.f. Rich, 1983). Knowledge of such aspects may be useful for designing adaptive interfaces and computer-based training methods <ref> (c.f. Egan, 1988) </ref>. Up to now there has only been limited theoretical and empirical work addressing the problem of discriminating users' with high and low performance quality by means of their interaction behavior.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, counting absolute frequencies is not the only possible way of characterizing the occurrence of different elementary or aggregate events. One can also determine relative frequencies or assess Conceptual Systems and Predictive Variance 2 average or total duration <ref> (cf. van Hooff, 1982) </ref>. Each manner of describing a given behavioral sequence implicitly defines a system of concepts, namely, those concepts which are applied for this description. In the following discussion such a system will be referred to as a conceptual system. <p> These aggregates will be referred to below as behavioral strings. In the most simple case, the behavioral strings are identical with the behavioral elements. In other cases, two successive elements, like copying following deleting, copying following copying or deleting following copying, may constitute the behavioral strings <ref> (c.f. van Hooff, 1982) </ref>. In other conceptual systems, there may be three, four or even more successive elements. <p> The third component is a measure which reflects the occurrence of the behavioral strings. This measure may be the absolute or relative frequency or the total or average duration of the strings to be found in the behavioral sequences <ref> (c.f. van Hooff, 1982) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We will compare some of these conceptual systems with respect to their predictive power of performance quality. The data we analyze were collected in a study by Upmeyer, Meseke, Enzmann and Schmid (1988). In this study novice users working with a computer aided design (CAD) system <ref> (c.f. Waern, 1988) </ref> were investigated. 3.1 Method 3.1.1 Subjects 23 undergraduate engineering students who had passed one introductory Au-toCAD course took part in the study. In addition, an engineer with a lot of experience in working professionally with AutoCAD also participated in the study.
