Title: Multiresolution Surface Reconstruction For Hierarchical B-splines  
Author: David Forsey and David Wong 
Affiliation: The Department of Computer Science The University of British Columbia  
Abstract: This paper presents a method for automatically generating a hierarchical B-spline surface from an initial set of control points. Given an existing mesh of control points , a mesh with half the resolution , is constructed by simultaneously approximating the finer mesh while minimizing a smoothness constraint using weighted least squares. Curvature measures of are used to identify features that need only be represented in the finer mesh. The resulting hierarchical surface accurately and economically reproduces the original mesh, is free from excessive undulations in the intermediate levels and produces a multiresolution representation suitable for animation and interactive modelling.

Reference-contexts: This greatly increases the time and cost of manipulating free-form shapes for tasks such as facial animation. A hierarchical B-spline <ref> [1] </ref> is a multi-resolution surface representation that provides: 1. Local refinement of tensor-product spline surfaces which localizes detail where it is required. 2. Multi-resolution surface editing that retains surface detail during broad-scale surface manipulation. 3. Economical surface representation. The surface in cal spline. 4. <p> Section 4 describes our particular implementation and numerical methods employed, Section 5 the results of applying the algorithm to a variety of inputs, and conclusions and future work are in Section 6. 2 Hierarchical B-Splines In 1988 Forsey & Bartels <ref> [1] </ref> introduced the concept of locally refining a B-spline surface. <p> On the other hand, changes in the shape of a parent surface alter , resulting in a procedurally defined move of . The reference+offset form allows a hierarchical B-spline surface to be locally refined so that patches can be added to a restricted region of the surface <ref> [1] </ref>, and improves the economy of the representation because the non-zero offsets totally define the shape of the surface. Offsets correspond to the difference between the shape of the surface at two levels of representation. The offset operator determines how that difference is interpreted. <p> k 1+[ ] V i j, k 1+[ ] k 1+[ ] O i j, 0= O i j, Ri j, k 1+[ ] V i j, k 1+[ ] k 1+[ ] V i j, k 1+[ ] SIGGRAPH 95 Submission 3 follow broad scale deformations of the surface <ref> [1] </ref> or of an underlying skeleton [2]. The hierarchical approach is not restricted to B-splines but is applicable to any representation where the basis functions have local support and are refinable.

Reference-contexts: Thus the hierarchy for a surface with a high-frequency spike would be modelled as flat except at the finest level of detail (Plate 2). A multiresolution representation created by least-squares approximation <ref> [7] </ref> or wavelet decomposition produces filtered surfaces that can also undulate (Figure 2). This is less useful if these coarser representations are used to interactively control shape.
