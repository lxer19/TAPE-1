Abstract: We describe a novel iterationless approach for computing the effective capacitance of an interconnect load at a driving gate output. Our new approach is considerably faster than previous methods for computing effective capacitance, with little or no loss of accuracy. Thus, the approach is suitable within the analysis loop for performance-driven iterative layout optimization. After reviewing previous gate load models and effective capacitance approximations, we separately derive our method for the cases of step and ramp waveform at the gate output, and note ongoing extensions for the case of complex gates (e.g., channel-connected components). Experimental results using the new effective capacitance approach show that our resulting delay estimates are quite accurate within 15% of HSPICE-computed delays on data corresponding to an 0.25m microprocessor design.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is applicable within the analysis loop for performance-driven iterative layout optimization. We begin our discussion in Section 2 with a review of gate load models; our previously proposed open-ended P model <ref> [2] </ref> is of particular interest since it affords a path to linear-time estimation. Section 3 reviews previous effective capacitance approaches, including the approach of McCormick and the approach of Pillage et al. <p> Similar lumped models are available with other industry timing analysis tools. of the driving point admittance of a load interconnect tree. 2.3 Open-ended RC P model and the RC P model. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we proposed a new one-segment RC P model, with predetermined parameter values that depend only on the total resistance and total capacitance, to model the driving point admittance of a distributed RC interconnect tree. <p> We propose to use a P model for the RC (RLC) network at the output of a gate to estimate the driving point admittance. In particular, we use the open-ended RC P model <ref> [2] </ref> cited above for the load at the gate output, because the P model parameters are now functions of total interconnect capacitance C tot and resistance R tot . <p> We believe that our effective capacitance approach works well for delay estimates at threshold voltages between 30% to 60%. The tail end of the response for effective capacitance model could deviate significantly from the actual response <ref> [2] </ref>. Furthermore, the above proposed methods provide accurate estimation of delay estimates, but do not provide accurate output waveforms that may be needed to derive the output waveforms of downstream gates. Note that computing the driver resistance R S is typically quite difficult for complex gate structures, e.g., channel-connected components.

Reference-contexts: This is a pessimistic first-order approximation <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 For deep-submicron technologies or MCM interconnects, the total interconnect resistance is large and comparable to the driver output resistance; actual delay is much smaller than that derived from the lumped capacitance model because the interconnect resistance shields the load capacitance seen by the gate driver.
