Reference-contexts: Dynamic operation requires that balance be actively maintained at all times. Dynamic robots, which can locomote even with a single leg, have a greater potential for speed and power efficiency. 1 2 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Experimental research on actively balanced running machines began with Matsuoka <ref> [15] </ref> who built a planar one-legged hopping machine to study repetitive hopping in humans. His machine was sliding on a 10 ffi inclined plane and thrusted by an electric solenoid. The first walking machine with active balance was built by Miura and Shimoyama [19].

Reference-contexts: Raibert's machines were constructed to investigate design and control issues for robotic locomotion and not to be power autonomous. Nevertheless, his quadruped is included in the figure for the sake of completeness. * McGeer's gravity walker <ref> [16] </ref> appears on the figure as much as three orders of magnitude below the other legged machines. This 3:5kg mechanism was constructed to investigate the similarity between the walking motion of legs and the rolling action of wheels.

Reference-contexts: Although the hopping height controller has no explicit speed dependent 28 CHAPTER 4. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS term, the stance duration is affected by increasing forward speed which increases the apparent vertical leg spring stiffness <ref> [17] </ref>. This variation in stance duration links the energy output of the leg actuator to the robot running speed. However, the effect is small compared to the relation between hip motor energy and running speed.

Reference-contexts: HARDWARE MODIFICATIONS 49 Compliant Running and Torsional Spring Design In conjunction with attempts to implement passive dynamic running on our prismatic, planar robot, a second robot, the Compliant Articulated Robotic Leg (CARL) has been constructed at ARL <ref> [18] </ref>. The design of CARL's actuation systems is based on simulation work in which compliant elements are included in series with both the knee and hip actuation systems. Moreover, CARL contains a passive, revolute ankle which has a compliance but no actuator. <p> The encoder signals have been intentionally offset for clarity and are shown above the hybrid sensor signals. These hybrid sensors will replace the encoders measuring hip angle and pitch angle. Moreover, CARL, the second generation revolute jointed robot constructed at ARL <ref> [18] </ref> will use these sensors at 5 locations. Chapter 6 Conclusion A project of this type involves many disciplines and affords an excellent opportunity to experience first hand the difficulties and rewards offered by the field of experimental, legged robotics research.

The planarizer employs horizontal and vertical ball slides riding on precision ground rods to allow free movement in the horizontal and vertical directions.

Reference-contexts: I next performed experiments to evaluate the torque-speed characteristics of our actuators. These results are given in Section 2.1.3 and led to the development of an analytically tractable, exactly implementable open-loop torque controller used to stabilize the hopping height <ref> [27] </ref>. This controller is described in Section 3.1. In the spring and summer design and construction of a body and actuated hip for the ARL Monopod proceeded (Section 2.2). <p> It is composed of a leg with a sliding prismatic knee joint and a mechanical spring. The leg attaches to a body through an actuated hip joint. Mechanical design considerations for the leg in Figure 2.1 are discussed in <ref> [27] </ref>. The layout of the monopod is shown in Figure 2.4. The robot has six degrees of freedom (DOF) of which only two are actuated. Actuation comes via two 80W brush DC motors (Maxon 2260 series) powered by PWM servo amplifiers (Galil MSA-12-80). <p> The design requires that the motor stall torque not be exceeded (t m ^t ) while the leg swings during running. A sinusoidal trajectory was used to represent the motion of the leg during running. Results from vertical hopping experiments performed with the robot leg <ref> [27] </ref> were used to estimate the parameters of this sinusoidal trajectory. A frequency of 2Hz equal to the vertical hopping frequency and an amplitude of 20 ffi corresponding to a running speed of 0:9m=s were selected. Body pitching was neglected. <p> Together with a ball screw travel of 0:13m, this configuration allows a maximum hip angle of 45 ffi . This set of parameters minimizes the motor torque-speed requirements for compliant running by matching the natural frequency of the system with the frequency of the vertical oscillations of 2Hz <ref> [27] </ref>. Chapter 3 Control 3.1 Three-part Decoupled Control Running for a single legged system is comprised of a stance phase during which the toe is in contact with the ground and a ballistic flight phase when the toe is off the ground and the robot behaves as a projectile. <p> For the ARL Monopod, the ground force acting against the leg actuator at maximum compression is approximately 500N , which makes the position step an impractical strategy with low power electric actuators. Instead we use a different open loop controller described in <ref> [27] </ref>, t = t (1 ^! which specifies a scaled version of the maximum torque-speed curve of our motor, equation (2.1), with 0 t &lt; ^t in the first quadrant (stance), and a high gain PD controller to return the actuator during flight. <p> Testing and evaluation of the new controller is not yet complete and all experimental results for robot running reported here were obtained using the manually controlled speed setpoint. 22 CHAPTER 4. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS 4.2 Experimental Results Experimental results regarding vertical hopping experiments are reported in <ref> [27] </ref>. This section reports on planar running experiments performed using the control laws presented in Chapter 3. A summary of these results has been published in [11]. 4.2.1 Position Tracking The first planar experiments were performed with zero treadmill speed. <p> During the second half of the stance phase this energy is returned to the system as the robot begins to move up and eventually lifts off. Unfortunately, this transfer involves a loss energy which translates into a lower lift-off speed (this energy loss is discussed in <ref> [27] </ref>). Thus the motion of the robot is similar to that of a bouncing ball which decreases in height with each bounce. In order to maintain a steady hopping height additional energy must be added to the system to account for losses.

Reference-contexts: The first walking machine with active balance was built by Miura and Shimoyama [19]. It operated with stiff legs, similar to humans on stilts. Our work has been inspired by past research of Marc Raibert <ref> [29] </ref> who has led the field of dynamically stable legged locomotion during the past decade. He built a variety of running robots, starting with a planar one-legged machine [28], followed by a 3D one-legged, a two-legged planar robot, and a quadruped. <p> This strategy was eminently successful and he built many different running robots based on an almost standardized set of custom parts. It is important to realize that all of his robots are controlled by some derivative of the tri-partitioned decoupled control developed for the original one-legged planar hopper <ref> [29] </ref>. Papantoniou [23, 22] has also built a planar monopod actuated by two electric motors and is using a derivative of Raibert's controller. He employs a clutch which engages the spinning motor at maximum leg compression to maximize energy transfer to the leg. <p> Hopping height is controlled during stance using the leg actuator while body attitude is simultaneously controlled using the hip actuation system. During flight, the hip actuator controls forward speed. In order to control the running motion of our robot, we took Raibert's three part control algorithm <ref> [29] </ref> and applied some hardware specific modifications as described below. 3.1.1 Vertical Motion (Hopping height control) In Raibert's running experiments he stabilized the vertical motion of his machines by specifying a constant position step to the leg actuator during stance at the instant of maximum leg compression.

Reference-contexts: Most of this return swing motion of the leg could be provided by a properly dimensioned spring in series with the hip actuator. This has been proposed and experimentally tested in passive (unstable) mode by Raibert <ref> [31] </ref>. Our robot has been designed to accommodate such springs as part of the hip actuation system. The equations of Section 2.2.2 were developed taking into account this compliance. Equation (2.5) gives the motor torque required to swing the leg through a sinusoidal path.
