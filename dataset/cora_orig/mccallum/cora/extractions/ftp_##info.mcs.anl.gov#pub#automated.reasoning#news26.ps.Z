Nominations for the Sacks Prize The Sacks prize, for the best recent doctoral dissertation in mathematical logic, will be awarded for the first time in December of 1994. This prize was established to honor Professor Gerald Sacks for his unique contribution to mathematical logic, particularly as advisor to a large number of excellent Ph.D. students. Eligibility: Doctorate completed between  Nominations: Nominations are made by the thesis advisor and consist of name and birthdate of student, title and 1-2 page description of dissertation, date and location where the doctorate was awarded, and letter of recommendation from the advisor.

Abstract: For the serious researcher, we offer summaries of recent workshops and a list of conferences * For the new Ph.D., we announce the newly established Sacks prize in mathematical logic. * For those inclined to more leisurely activities, we suggest some new books to read on a hot * For those "in between," we report on theorem proving reduced to a game. * Finally, for the daring, we present a challenge with, yes, the offer of real money (though not at the lottery level). to prepare papers for.
