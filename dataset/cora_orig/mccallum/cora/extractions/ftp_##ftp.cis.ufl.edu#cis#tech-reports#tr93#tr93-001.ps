Reference-contexts: Most of the earlier research on active databases and commercial implementations have concentrated on the support for active capability in the context of relational database systems [5, 20, 24, 9, 16]. Only recently, there have been a number of attempts <ref> [14, 13, 10, 19, 21, 6, 1, 7, 18, 11, 12] </ref> at incorporating event and rule support into an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS). 1.1 Paradigm Differences Clearly, there is a paradigm shift when we move from the relational model to an object-oriented one.

Reference-contexts: This warrants re-examination of the functionality as well as the mechanism by which reactive capability is incorporated into the object-oriented data model <ref> [2] </ref>. Furthermore, the differences between the two data models have an influence on how the concepts are carried over. Below, we enumerate some of the differences between the data models that led to the design choices presented in this paper: 1.

Reference-contexts: Lastly and more importantly, rules triggered by events spanning distinct classes can be expressed.

Zeitgeist is an open, modular, extensible architecture for object oriented database systems, implemented in C++ on Sun4 Unix platforms. In order to incorporate rules in Zeitgeist we modified the class hierarchy to include newly defined classes, namely, the Reactive, Notifiable, Event and Rule classes.

Reference-contexts: Trigger bodies are executed in separate transactions after the commit (not necessarily immediately after) of the transaction firing them. More recently Ode [14] has proposed a language for specifying composite events. They specify complex events using a set of operators similar to Snoop <ref> [8] </ref>; events are declared within a class at class definition time. Basic 4 (primitive) events are defined and composite events are constructed by applying operators to basic events. The basic events supported are object state events, method execution events, timed events and transaction events. <p> For any operator, E1 and E2 may potentially be composite events. For additional event operators and the BNF of an expressive event specification language refer to <ref> [8] </ref>. The definition of events involves the description of their structure and behavior. An Event superclass was defined to provide the common structure and behavior shared by all event types. 14 By creating an event class hierarchy, primitive and complex event structure and behavior were defined using inheritance. <p> We intend to transform a higher-level user specification of an active database to Sentinel, * Our work supports the specification and detection of complex events. However, we have only supported a subset of the events specified in Snoop <ref> [8] </ref> and the most recent context for parameter computation.

Only recently, there have been a number of attempts <ref> [14, 13, 10, 19, 21, 6, 1, 7, 18, 11, 12] </ref> at incorporating event and rule support into an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS). 1.1 Paradigm Differences Clearly, there is a paradigm shift when we move from the relational model to an object-oriented one. <p> In this approach, it is cumbersome to make a rule applicable to only a small number of instances. To the best of our understanding, Ode [13, 14] has taken the first approach and ADAM <ref> [10] </ref> the second one. It is likely that the environments used by these two systems (C++ and PROLOG, respectively) have been a factor for the approaches. 1.2 Contributions As there are several commercially available object-oriented databases, techniques for incorporating active capability is gaining attention. <p> We also support rules as first class objects. Most importantly, we introduce a monitoring viewpoint (termed external monitoring viewpoint ) that is not present in either Ode [13, 14] or ADAM <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Section 7 contains conclusions with a back-of-the-envelope comparison of ADAM, Ode, and Sentinel. It also contains future research directions. 2 Related Work Although a number of efforts have addressed incorporating active capability in the context of an OODBMS [21, 19, 5, 22, 23], mostly Ode [13, 14] and ADAM <ref> [10] </ref> are pertinent to the material presented in this paper. Below, we briefly summarize them. Ode provides active behavior by the incorporation of rules, in the form of constraints and triggers. Both constraints and triggers consist of a condition and an action and are defined within class definitions. <p> Detection of events is accomplished by using a finite automata. Each event expression maps an event history to another event history that contains only those events at which the event expression is satisfied and the trigger should fire. ADAM <ref> [10] </ref> is an active OODB implemented in PROLOG. It focuses on providing a uniform approach to the treatment of rules in an object-oriented environment. Both events and rules are treated as first class objects which are created, deleted and modified in the same fashion as other objects. <p> Currently, three approaches are used: i) events as expressions declared within class definitions, e.g., Ode [13, 14], ii) events as rule attributes, e.g., Bauz [19], and iii) events as first class objects, e.g., ADAM <ref> [10] </ref>. Below, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Events as Expressions : This approach is motivated by runtime processing gains, since processing of event specification is performed primarily at compile time and little or none at runtime.

Below, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. <p> Fourth, the structure and behavior of rules can be tailored to model the requirements of various applications. For example, it is possible to create subclasses of the rule class and define special attributes or operations on those subclasses. As an example, hard and soft constraints of Ode <ref> [13, 14] </ref> can be modeled as subclasses of the rule class. Lastly, by treating rules as first class objects an extensible system is provided.

Reference-contexts: Constraints are further classified into soft and hard constraints. Soft constraints allow temporal inconsistencies to exist within a transaction and thus are checked at the end (before commit) of a transaction, i.e., in deferred coupling mode of HiPAC <ref> [15] </ref>. In contrast, hard constraints are checked at the end of each non-constant public method, i.e., the immediate coupling mode. Triggers in Ode are parameterized and are of two types: perpetual and once-only.

Reference-contexts: We consider this generalization extremely important as the expressiveness and the extensibility of the resulting system is significantly enhanced (Ode has tried to implement the functionality of inter-object rules in a straightforward manner by making the same set of rules applicable to more than one object class <ref> [17] </ref>). This feature enables the seamless integration of rules as well. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes related work.
