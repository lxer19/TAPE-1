Abstract: It has been established that certain trilinear froms of three perspective views give rise to a tensor of 27 intrinsic coefficients [11]. We show in this paper that a permutation of the the trilinear coefficients produces three homography matrices (projective transformations of planes) of three distinct intrinsic planes, respectively. This, in turn, yields the result that 3D invariants are recovered directly | simply by appropriate arrangement of the tensor's coefficients. On a secondary level, we show new relations between fundamental matrix, epipoles, Euclidean structure and the trilinear tensor. On the practical side, the new results extend the existing envelope of methods of 3D recovery from 2D views | for example, new linear methods that cut through the epipolar geometry, and new methods for computing epipolar geometry using redundancy available across many views.

Reference-contexts: In the case of two cameras, the correspondence constraint is a bilinear function of image coordinates whose coefficients can be arranged in a matrix, known as the fundamental matrix <ref> [3, 1] </ref>. The bilinear constraint describes the epipolar geometry ("coplanarity constraint" known in photogrammetric circles), and once it is known the 3D structure of the scene can be recovered (linearly) up to a projective transformation [2, 6, 10]. The case of three cameras is a recent topic of investigation. <p> Thus the projective coordinates of a point P projecting onto p; p 0 is <ref> [x; y; 1; k] </ref> where k satisfies the equation p 0 ~ = A p+kv 0 . The scalar k remains fixed between 1 and any other view i if the same fiducial plane is used [12]. <p> Hence, the more views we have the larger system of equations we have for F for a least-squares solution. Non-linear components may be added to this basic scheme by enforcing the rank constraint of F , and other constraints like in <ref> [1] </ref>. We end this section with two results on the internal structure of the trilinear tensor. Corollary 3 The intrinsic homography matrices E 1 ; E 2 ; E 3 are generically full rank.

Computing projective invariants of the scene requires the identification of five fiducial (reference/basis) points, and in the case of two views, can be achieved (linearly) by observing the projections of those five points and the epipoles <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. For example, the projections of points 1,2,3 and the epipoles determine the homography A 1 of the plane spanned by points 1,2,3. The projections of points 2,3,4 (and the epipoles) determine the homography A 2 of the plane spanned by points 2,3,4.

Reference-contexts: We show that there are three generic ways to permute the tensor into sets of the three matrices. One of these permutations was recently shown by Hartley <ref> [5] </ref> to yield, somewhat unexpectedly, the three matrices associated with lines over three views [7, 15, 13].

To complete the picture of the tensor decomposition into sets of matrices we summarize the highlights of this arrangement. Unlike the previous two arrangements, the matrices T k = ff k are not homography matrices, and they are of rank 2 (instead of 3).
