Reference-contexts: His design was constructed entirely of a single type of gate, the conservative Selector gate, and suggested no implementation strategy. Nonetheless, his work is important in that it reflects the only work we are aware of which is directly relevant to our goal of architecting fully reversible computers. Baker <ref> [Bak92] </ref> has suggested several novel physics based architectural ideas, concentrating mostly on garbage collection technology, and his work shares many of the higher level motivations of this proposal. 30

Reference-contexts: Landauer [Lan61] recognized that the dissipation is only unavoidable when information is destroyed, and therefore a reversible computation, in which no information is destroyed, need not dissipate any energy. This close relationship 28 between reversibility and low energy computation was first noted by Fredkin [FT78] and Bennett <ref> [Ben73] </ref>. Fredkin [FT78] proposed an implementation of conservative logic gates based on a technology incorporating an inductor in each gate. The lack of a plausible implementation technology prevented this approach from being taken seriously.

Reference-contexts: Storrs-Hall [Hal92] at Rutgers has recently worked on latch design using techniques very similar in spirit to SCRL gates.

These diode based techniques are unable to recover energy which is dissipated in the charging and discharging of nodes below the forward diode drop of the nonlinear device.

Reference-contexts: When intermediate results are reached, values on the garbage stack may be uncomputed using instructions such as "UNADD" <ref> [Hal94] </ref>. 2.1 Symmetries and Control Flow I had originally thought that it should be possible to organize the computation so that there would be only an arbitrary distinction between "forward" and "reverse" operation. <p> And since all control flow instructions push the PC there need only be one CF instruction, simplifying control. All of this comes, of course, at the cost of increased garbage, but the storage requirements are potentially less than what would be required under a scheme <ref> [Hal94] </ref> which required the branch conditional to remain unchanged by the subsequent code.

Reference-contexts: This informational entropy, now widely used in Claude Shannon's information theory, was long seen as a fundamental limit of the minimum entropic increase during a computation. In the early 1960's, Landauer <ref> [Lan61] </ref> associated irreversibility and energy dissipation but mistakenly (he later corrected himself) believed that logical irreversibility was required for computation. <p> The association of an energy or entropy quantity with a single degree of freedom (one bit), and an associated dissipation of energy during computation, began with Maxwell's Demon [Max75] and Szilard's analysis [Szi29] of the Demon. Landauer <ref> [Lan61] </ref> recognized that the dissipation is only unavoidable when information is destroyed, and therefore a reversible computation, in which no information is destroyed, need not dissipate any energy.

Reference-contexts: Since I decided early on that Pendulum should be a 32 bit machine, I started with the Patterson/Hennessy <ref> [PH93] </ref> MIPS instruction word encoding. But, since I have disallowed certain types of register operations, I only need to specify two registers: a source/destination and a source.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 What is Reversible Computing? Over 15 years ago, Ressler commented that "Designing computers out of reversible logic is a fairly recent idea." <ref> [Res79] </ref> While it may no longer be classified as a recent idea, it is certainly in need of further development. This thesis outlines a number of the design decisions and options concerning reversible computing.

Reference-contexts: These are the two metrics, in order of priority, considered in the design of the Pendulum processor. 8 Chapter 2 Pendulum Processor Overview A key point is going to be how this thesis differs from Ressler's <ref> [Res81] </ref>. <p> Experiments to quantify this result more precisely are under way, but tentative upper bounds on the energy dissipation agree with simulation results within the limits of our current measurement ability. 3.0.1 Architecture Ressler <ref> [Res81] </ref> investigated a conservative reversible logic family with which he symbolically designed a very simple accumulator based computer. His design was constructed entirely of a single type of gate, the conservative Selector gate, and suggested no implementation strategy.

Reference-contexts: As logic swings are reduced to the hundreds of millivolt range, the forward drop of foreseeable nonlinear devices looms as a larger and larger fraction of the logic swing, making these diode based techniques, while quite useful today, of limited long term interest. In our previous work <ref> [YK93, YK94] </ref> we proposed a new form of energy efficient CMOS logic family, based on the SCRL (Split level Charge Recovery Logic) gate.

Reference-contexts: At this stage in the design I am primarily concerned with this high level reversibility. At the circuit level, and assuming that the processor will be implemented in Younis and Knight's SCRL logic <ref> [YK94] </ref>, reversibility is required to recover charge stored on the gates of transistors rather than discharging it to ground. My research will focus almost exclusively on building a processor which can be run in either direction. <p> As logic swings are reduced to the hundreds of millivolt range, the forward drop of foreseeable nonlinear devices looms as a larger and larger fraction of the logic swing, making these diode based techniques, while quite useful today, of limited long term interest.
