Abstract: We present an expanded mixed finite element approximation of second order elliptic problems containing a tensor coefficient. The mixed method is expanded in the sense that three variables are explicitly approximated, namely, the scalar unknown, the negative of its gradient, and its flux (the tensor coefficient times the negative gradient). The resulting linear system is a saddle point problem. In the case of the lowest order Raviart-Thomas elements on rectangular parallelepipeds, we approximate this expanded mixed method by incorporating certain quadrature rules. This enables us to write the system as a simple, cell-centered finite difference method, requiring the solution of a sparse, positive semidefinite linear system for the scalar unknown. For a general tensor coefficient, the sparsity pattern for the scalar unknown is a nine point stencil in two dimensions, and 19 points in three dimensions. Existing theory shows that the expanded mixed method gives optimal order approximations in the L 2 and H s -norms (and superconvergence is obtained between the L 2 -projection of the scalar variable and its approximation). We show that these rates of convergence are retained for the finite difference method. If h denotes the maximal mesh spacing, then the optimal rate is O(h). The superconvergence rate O(h 2 ) is obtained for the scalar unknown and rate O(h 3=2 ) for its gradient and flux in certain discrete norms; moreover, the full O(h 2 ) is obtained in the strict interior of the domain. Computational results illustrate these theoretical results. 1. Introduction. We consider mixed finite element approximations of second

Reference-contexts: Moreover, Russell and Wheeler showed that in fact their quadrature rules turned the mixed method into a cell-centered finite difference scheme with a five point stencil (or "computational molecule") if d = 2, or seven if d = 3. Weiser and Wheeler <ref> [31] </ref> showed that the modified scheme converges at the rate of the unmodified scheme. This is true also of the super-convergence that is obtained for the velocity u and pressure p in certain discrete norms [24], [16], [18]. <p> If the grids are generated by a C 2 map, then r = 2 for points strictly in the interior of that lie on an edge or face e such that e " D = ;. Proof. We apply a result due to Weiser and Wheeler <ref> [31; Lemma 4.1 and appendix] </ref> to (~u; p) satisfying the elliptic problem r ~u = F r rp in ; p = G pj @ on @: This gives a P satisfying (5.1.2) and, through (5.1.1a), ~ U satisfies (5.1.3) for ~r = 2 strictly in the interior of . <p> We also recovered the superconvergence result for diagonal K <ref> [31] </ref> (extended to Robin conditions). 5.3. Estimates for the scalars p and . We now consider bounding the error in pressure for the finite difference method.

A similar formulation was considered by Chen [11] to approximate a nonlinear problem, using only the BDM spaces [9]. He also presented a convergence analysis (see also [12]), but did not discuss implementation. Koebbe [21] used the expanded mixed formulation to solve problems with a tensor coefficient.
