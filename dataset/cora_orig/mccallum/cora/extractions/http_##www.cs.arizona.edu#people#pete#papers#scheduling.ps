Abstract: In this paper we consider scheduling n tasks with task times that are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution function F on m parallel machines. Scheduling is done by an a priori assignment of tasks to processors. We show that if the distribution function F is a Plya frequency function of order 2 then the assignment which attempts to place an equal number of tasks on each processor achieves the stochastically smallest makespan among all assignments. The condition embraces many important distributions, such as the gamma and truncated normal distributions.

The makespan of the assignment which places k tasks on each of machines is stochastically less than the makespan of the assignment which places tasks on each of k machines.
