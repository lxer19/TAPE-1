Title: Coupling Efficiency with Coupling Modes in Active Databases Proofs of lemmas and theorems

Abstract: The paper presents a general framework for handling coupling modes in active databases and discusses the inter-relationships between a set of coupling modes of an application and transaction efficiency. While the major role of coupling modes in active databases is to reduce ambiguous interpretation of transactions, coupling modes can affect the transaction's efficiency as well. Therefore, a default coupling mode is defined for each rule in a given application, based on efficiency considerations. This mechanism enables a designer of an application to consider efficiency while determining coupling modes, and base the coupling modes decision on theoretical grounds. This issue is particularly important in workflow management, where use of active databases in workflows on the one hand, and the failure of commercial products to support applications with high-throughput workflows on the other hand, requires an efficient execution process. Thus, this framework is part of CODES, a COntrol and Data Engineering of Systems, which is an extended design tool for workflows. keywords: active databases, coupling modes

Reference-contexts: U R is a set of update relationships that connect operations with the properties they update. A compound event is represented using a set of events connected through triggering edges. Similarly, a compound action is represented using a set of actions connected through triggering edges. Using common design methods <ref> [1] </ref>, encapsulation levels can be defined such that events that form a compound event are encapsulated within a single triangle, and a set of actions that form a compound action are encapsulated within a single circle. The dependency graph may have cycles.
