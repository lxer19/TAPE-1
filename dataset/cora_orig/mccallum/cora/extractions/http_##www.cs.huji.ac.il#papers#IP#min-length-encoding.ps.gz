Abstract: Technical Report 89-11 June 1989 Abstract The paradigm of minimal length encoding is used for superior segmenting and compressing of waveforms. These methods sre shown to be applicable also for segmenting and edge finding in pictures.

Reference-contexts: Projection of a polynomial surface image on one dimension is useful because any intersection of a d'th degree polynomial surface, bivariate polynomial, with a plane is a d'th degree univariate polynomial. Polynomials are suitable, for instance, for the case of optical flow; It is known <ref> [1] </ref> that planar bodies in rigid motion give rise to optical flow that is a second-order polynomial in the image coordinates.

Reference-contexts: The reason we do not compute the minimum length encoding directly in two dimensions is that it is the class NPC, as the problem of minimal partition is NPC <ref> [2] </ref>. Projection of a polynomial surface image on one dimension is useful because any intersection of a d'th degree polynomial surface, bivariate polynomial, with a plane is a d'th degree univariate polynomial.

Reference-contexts: If this fails, the data is divided and the attempt to fit is continued recursively. When this is done, a merging stage is run in which similar segments are merged according to some acceptability criteria. In the edge detection approach <ref> [3] </ref>, an edge detector of some kind is applied to the data and the segments are determined by the resulting edge points.

Reference-contexts: In computer science and statistics this idea is known as Kolmogorov complexity. It has also appeared in Valiant's learning theory and Rissansen's minimum description length principle. For more uses, history and references see <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper we show how to use this paradigm in order to segment waveforms into meaningful simple parts. These simple parts are the atoms of the waveform, so that if they can be encoded by a short description.

Reference-contexts: Other possible methods are the use of different criteria for goodness of fit such as such as maximum absolute deviation, sums of absolute deviation, fixed tolerances or robust statistics. For a review of the above mentioned mathematical techniques and algorithms, see <ref> [5, ?] </ref>. 1 There are 40 points composed of four segments and contaminated by Gaussian noise. The dots correspond to the data and the lines to the fitted polynomials. There are four polynomial segments: (from left to right) second order, first order, constant and first order.

Reference-contexts: We not only have a good segmentation of the waveform, but also a succinct encoding of it. We also show some results using these one dimensional segmentations for segmenting two dimensional pictures. Segmenting waveforms has been treated in <ref> [6, 7] </ref> and a specific type of segmenting pictures using minimal description length is described in [8]. Segments The "atoms" from which the waveforms will be composed of are called segments.

Comparison to Other Methods Two other approaches of segmenting waveforms are sub-division and edge detection. In the subdivision approach <ref> [7] </ref>, one tries to fit a member of F to the data. If this fails, the data is divided and the attempt to fit is continued recursively. When this is done, a merging stage is run in which similar segments are merged according to some acceptability criteria.

A segment is a member of a parametric family of functions F = ff t g, usually, in our studies, polynomials or trigonometric functions.
