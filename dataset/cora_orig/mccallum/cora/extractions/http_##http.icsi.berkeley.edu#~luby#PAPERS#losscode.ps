Abstract: We present a randomized construction of linear-time encodable and decodable codes that can transmit over lossy channels at rates extremely close to capacity. The encoding and decoding algorithms for these codes have fast and simple software implementations. Partial implementations of our algorithms are faster by orders of magnitude than the best software implementations of any previous algorithm for this problem. We expect these codes will be extremely useful for applications such as real-time audio and video transmission over the Internet, where lossy channels are common and fast decoding is a requirement. Despite the simplicity of the algorithms, their design and analysis are mathematically intricate. The design requires the careful choice of a random irregular bipartite graph, where the structure of the irregular graph is extremely important. We model the progress of the decoding algorithm by a set of differential equations. The solution to these equations can then be expressed as polynomials in one variable with coefficients determined by the graph structure. Based on these polynomials, we design a graph structure that guarantees successful decoding with high probability. fl International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, California.

Reference-contexts: Such a scheme can be used as the basic building block for the more robust and general protection scheme described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem is to design fast enough encoding and decoding algorithms to make this solution feasible. In this paper, we present codes that can be encoded and decoded in linear time while providing near optimal loss protection. <p> Reed-Solomon codes can be used to transmit at the capacity of the erasure channel with order n log n encoding time and quadratic decoding time. These codes have recently been customized to compensate for Internet packet loss in real-time transmission of moderate-quality video <ref> [1] </ref>. Even this optimized implementation required the use of dedicated workstations. Transmission of significantly higher quality video requires faster coding algorithms. In theory, it is possible to decode Reed-Solomon codes in time O (n log 2 n log log n) (see, [4, Chapter 11.7] and [9, p. 369]).

Reference-contexts: recovered with exponentially small probability, as the block length grows large. 8 The following combinatorial tail arguments is useful in showing that the process termi-nates successfully when there are no nodes on the left of degree one or two. (Such arguments are often required in similar situations; see, for example, <ref> [5] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: We assume that the receiver knows the position of each received symbol within the stream of all encoding symbols. This is appropriate for the Internet, where packets are indexed. We adopt as our model of losses the erasure channel, introduced by Elias <ref> [6] </ref>, in which each encoding symbol is lost with a fixed constant probability p in transit independent of all the other symbols. This assumption is not appropriate for the Internet, where losses can be highly correlated and bursty. <p> However, losses on the Internet in general are not sensitive to the actual contents of each packet, and thus if we place the encoding into the packets in a random order then the independent loss assumption is valid. Elias <ref> [6] </ref> showed that the capacity of the erasure channel is 1 p and that a random linear code can be used to transmit over the erasure channel at any rate R &lt; 1 p.

Reference-contexts: Proving the process progresses almost to completion if (5) is satisfied is possible by relating the differential equations to the underlying random process (see, e.g., <ref> [8, 10] </ref>). Proving the process runs to completion can be handled with a separate combinatorial argument. In some cases, however, this requires small modifications in the graph construction.

These codes can be decoded in linear time and encoded in quadratic time with miniscule constants. <p> Thus, we only need to show that the initial graph is a good expander on small sets. Since the degree of each node on the left is at least three, standard proofs (see <ref> [11] </ref>) suffice to show that the expansion condition holds with high probability for all sets containing at most an j fraction of the left nodes. 2 Using Lemmas 2 and 3, we can show that the codes presented in Section 7 work with high probability.
