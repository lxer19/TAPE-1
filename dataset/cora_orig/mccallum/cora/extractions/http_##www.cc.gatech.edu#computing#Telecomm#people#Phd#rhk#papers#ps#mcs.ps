Title: Payoff-Based Communication Adaptation based on Network Service Availability  
Author: Robin Kravets Ken Calvert Karsten Schwan 
Abstract: Interactive applications will continue to push the limits of available network bandwidths, processing speeds, and other computing resources. These applications present challenges concerning the specification of service requirements for their multiple types of data transfer and the online management of service quality. In this paper, we present a cooperative solution in which a configurable communication layer is used to adapt communication in response to both application requirements and network resource availability. Adaptation decisions are based on (1) payoff functions which capture the requirements of the application in a functional form, and (2) service availability curves which represent network resource availability. Experimentation with representative multimedia applications demonstrates the benefit of using such payoff-based adaptation.

Reference-contexts: When service availability curves are not available, communication resource availability may be determined by the application itself, perhaps by gathering statistics based on recent communication history and by projecting such behavior into the near future <ref> [Bol] </ref>. The sample loss-load curve depicted in figure 4 exhibits an increasing loss rate as the application increases its transfer rate.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we demonstrate the use of payoff adaptation to optimize the use of available communication resources. The payoff adaptation method employed in this work is reactive. Specifically, it responds to changes in application requirements and network resources rather than attempting to anticipate them, as in predictive <ref> [BS91, CKV93] </ref> and in learning-theory based adaptation methods [KLV95, KLP + 95]. Payoff adaptation techniques allow us to balance application requirements like quality level and running time with resource availability. Resource information may be defined as execution time, available bandwidth, or message loss rate. Two stages of adaptation.

Reference-contexts: This section describes the benefits of payoff adaptation for such continuous objects. Image transfer is the basis for many multimedia applications and is often tolerant to some loss. This tolerance enables the use of payoff-based communication adaptation. Turner and Peterson describe a retransmission-free protocol for image transfer <ref> [TP92] </ref>. They make the assumption that applications can give up some degree of image quality for a decrease in delay. The application is given the choice of getting all retransmissions or none.

Reference-contexts: In addition, by monitoring dynamic resource availability from the network, the communication layer is able to make intelligent decisions about the communication configuration best suited for the currently available network resources.

This relationship can be represented through the use of service availability curves. This type of service has been proposed <ref> [WC91] </ref> in the form of Loss-Load Curves. Loss-load curves characterize the dynamic service a network can provide to its clients. Given a specific transmission rate for a sender, loss-load curves provide the sender with an expected loss rate.
