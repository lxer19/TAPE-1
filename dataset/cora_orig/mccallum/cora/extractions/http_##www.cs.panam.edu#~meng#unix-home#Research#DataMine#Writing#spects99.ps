Reference-contexts: Sugiura's work [8] and Lawrence-Fowler's work [3] concentrate on the issue of personalizing the Web page from client point of view. They both create annotated Web pages to help users index and navigate Web using personalized information. Frelechoux and Kamba <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a user profile manager in between the server and the client: a proxy server that relives the personalized servers from the tasks of user profile management and provides support for advanced personalization techniques such as collaborative filtering.

Reference-contexts: It can be considered as part of a Web server's functionality; it can be considered as part of a Web client's functionality; or it can be the work of a proxy server. Many research projects have tackled the issue from different perspectives. Gabber et.al. <ref> [2] </ref> described a structure (the Janus Personalized Web Anonymizer) that makes the personalized Web browsing feasible. Janus automatically generates an alias for each user that can be used to establish an anonymous account at the Web site.

Reference-contexts: It frees the user from the burden of inventing and memorizing distinct usernames and secure passwords for each Web site and guarantees that an alias does not reveal the true identity of the user. Sugiura's work [8] and Lawrence-Fowler's work <ref> [3] </ref> concentrate on the issue of personalizing the Web page from client point of view. They both create annotated Web pages to help users index and navigate Web using personalized information.

Reference-contexts: However users are reluctant to allow search engines to collect and keep their information on the server site because of the concern of privacy. We proposed a mechanism to build a personalized profile on the client side, typically stored on a user's personal computer <ref> [5] </ref>. This relieves the privacy concern of the users. In this paper we study the results of the search when this personalized profile is used to improve the accuracy. In Section 2 we overview the system architecture. <p> The filtered results are sent to the browser. 6. The browser displays the filtered results to the user. The user profile is built by calculating the frequency of word usage in the user's file system (see <ref> [5] </ref> for details). We assume each user has a dedicated computer when she accesses the Internet. We call it home station. The building process would go through the whole file structure on the home station that the user uses to accumulate the word frequencies.

Reference-contexts: We review some related works in Section 4, followed by some of our thoughts and future work in Section 5. 2 Overview of the System Architecture Personalized profile helps accurate information retrieval. Such ideas have been used in many applications, for example, PointCast <ref> [6] </ref> uses a personalized profile to selectively point cast information to individual computers. 1 Other times a search engine may ask the user to establish an account on the server side where some personal preferences can be stored to help future search.
