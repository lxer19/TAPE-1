Reference-contexts: Such a workload characterization is inevitably controversial. To minimize this controversy, we restrict ourselves to the relatively straightforward movies-on-demand application. In earlier work, we presented evidence to support our workload characterization <ref> [1] </ref>. This included predicted sizes for video objects and the throughput required per video stream for typical compression schemes; an estimate of locality of requests based on video store rental patterns; and typical user population sizes and response time constraints based on a survey of existing and proposed video servers. <p> We have shown <ref> [1] </ref> that one example of movie rental history approximately matches a Zipf's Law distribution. <p> Below, we show that both VCR-like operations and disk failures are somewhat more difficult problems for a striped disk scheme. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we present simulation results for several variations of the one-movie-per-disk scheme. We show that replication of popular movies is essential to good performance. <p> The striped video server offers higher disk utilization and lower cost per stream. The latter is shown in Table 7. For more simluation results regarding striped disk video servers, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 8 Storage Hierarchies for Video Service In the last section, we showed that a video server composed of magnetic disks uses the relatively inexpensive bandwidth of disks to provide low-cost video streams. <p> The vertical axis shows the number of streams serviced by the tape library when 95% of requests must be serviced within an hour. (We chose such a long response time constraint because tape libraries have very long access times <ref> [1] </ref>.) The horizontal axis shows the percentage of the total of 1000 movies that are stored on tape, with the remainder of the movies stored on disk.

Reference-contexts: The first is to build the server entirely out of magnetic disks. Disk-based systems fall into two categories: disk arrays and disk farms. Disk arrays (RAIDs <ref> [2] </ref>) include specialized software and/or hardware controllers that stripe data among disks and maintain parity information. Disk farms are simple collections of disks generally attached to the standard I/O interfaces of hosts, usually without maintaining parity information and often without data striping.
