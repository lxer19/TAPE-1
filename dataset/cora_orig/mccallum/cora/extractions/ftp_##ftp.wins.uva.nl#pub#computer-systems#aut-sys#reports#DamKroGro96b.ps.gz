Abstract: In this paper we consider the conversion of sensor data to a probabilistic representation of the environment (occupancy grid). We introduce a neural network which learns these conversions. The conversion of sensor data remains adaptive to changes in either the sensor or its environment. To place this work in a broader context we describe the architecture of our Sensor Data Fusion system in which these conversions are applied. We also introduce the PDOP: a rule for fusing occupancy grids in this system.

Reference-contexts: This conversion involves modeling of the sensors' error characteristics. At first the sensor's performance was modeled with standard mathematical models ([6]) but it has been generally acknowledged that these models are not sufficiently accurate. Therefore, several algorithms were devised to learn these models in a calibration phase <ref> [13, 2, 4] </ref>). In this article we present a neural network approach to the learning of (inverse) sensor models.

The main characteristics of the architecture are: * Data from each measuring device are first converted to an internal representation. * This internal representation is common to all sen sors. * The actual fusion of data is performed in this inter nal representation. <p> An important choice in the application of such an architecture is the choice of an internal representation. For our robot the task at hand is collision free navigation within an unknown environment. We used a robot-centered occupancy grid <ref> [6] </ref>, becaused it is a good example of a representation in which uncertainty can be modelled adequately. The robot's local environment is discretized in a number of cells and for each cell the probability is given that it is being occupied by an obstacle. <p> These grid are then fused to obtain a more reliable model of the robot's environment. A sketch of this system is given in Fig. 1. This SDF system is similar to the one proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, where the system includes an additional layer to maintain a global, world centered representation of the environment. It is generally acknowledged (see, e.g., [17]) that a key issue in the approach to sensor data fusion as presented here is how to convert the sensor measurements to the internal representation. <p> fusion rule is to obtain the probabilities P (occ (c j ) j s 1 ; : : : ; s n ) when multiple sensors s i are used. 3.2 Pairwise Dependent Opinion Pool The rule that is most frequently used with occupancy grids is the independent opinion pool.(see <ref> [6] </ref>) It assumes that all converted sensor measurements are independent. In this case it can be shown that the following holds: P (occ (c j ) j s 1 ; : : : ; s n ) = k i with k a normalizing constant. <p> Note that in our neural network approach this is automatically taken care of in the generation of learning samples. Much effort has been devoted to the definition of accurate sensor models. Initially standard mathematical functions were used as sensor models for ease of computation. In <ref> [6] </ref> Gaussian shaped sensor models were proposed; this has become a common approach in the use of occupancy grids. If such Gaussian shaped sensor models are used, the sensor measurements can be converted to an occupancy grid using (1). An example of such a conversion is sketched in fig. 2.

After the robot takes a sensor measurement s with the simulated acoustic sensor, it follows a path to explore the (local) environment with touch sensors. This path is then represented in an occupancy grid G bin and the network is trained with (s; G bin ).

An important choice in the application of such an architecture is the choice of an internal representation. For our robot the task at hand is collision free navigation within an unknown environment.

Reference-contexts: This learning rule is called the generalized ffi-rule. The weights to the hidden units can be adjusted similarly by first back-propagating the summed squared error to the hidden units and then applying gradient descent to the back-propagated error (see <ref> [15] </ref>). 4.2.3 Learning samples: Sense and Drive Unfortunately, is it not possible to obtain such learning samples (s; G) in practice. In practice, we can only obtain sensor measurements s in environments for which we now for certain whether or not the cells in the grid G are occupied.
