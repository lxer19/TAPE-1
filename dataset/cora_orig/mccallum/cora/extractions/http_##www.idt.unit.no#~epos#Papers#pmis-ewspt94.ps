Title: A Comparison of Modelling Frameworks for Software Processes and Information Systems  
Author: Reidar Conradi, Geir Magne Htydalsvik, Guttorm Sindre, 
Keyword: software process modelling, information systems modelling.  
Address: Trondheim, Norway.  
Affiliation: Norwegian Institute of Technology,  
Abstract: This paper takes the position that software process mod-elling and information systems modelling are closely related in topic | although research is performed by two rather distinct camps and approaches differ. We think that both fields would benefit from more cooperation. The close relationship between the fields is indicated by a modelling example.

Reference-contexts: Record referee-reports and select papers for presentation. 6. Group papers into sessions and appoint chairman for each session. To keep the example short we will focus on a decomposition of "Distribute papers among referees". IFIP in PPP The solution depicted in Figure 3 is adopted from <ref> [Ber87] </ref>. It can briefly be described as follows: When the current date reach the submission deadline, a signal will cause P3.1 to be activated (triggered). Before this process is allowed to execute, items P in S1 must be available.

Reference-contexts: Additional concepts include ports, triggering rules and timers, this to remove vagueness and make the model executable. Graphical symbols for ports include AND, XOR, OR, repeated output and conditional output or any combination of these. 2.2 EPOS-PM The EPOS PML or SPELL <ref> [CJM + 92] </ref> is used to describe product models (for passive artifacts), activity models (for "active" tasks), tool models (as envelopes), and to some degree role models and project models. SPELL is fully object-oriented data model with explicit relations, meta-types, and where tasks are special objects.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a closer coupling between the fields should therefore be fruitful. For this exercise we use the PPP approach for information systems modelling, and the EPOS approach for software process modelling. 2 Examples 2.1 PPP The PPP (Phenomena, Process and Programs) environment <ref> [GLW91] </ref> is based on a certain development strategy for IS.
