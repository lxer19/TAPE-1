Abstract: Over the past year our group has begun development of telephone-based speech understanding capability for our GALAXY conversational system. An important part of this process has been the collection of telephone speech which was used for training and evaluation. In the first phase of data collection our goal was to collect read speech from a wide variety of talkers, telephone handsets, and noise/channel conditions. In the second phase of data collection our additional goal was to collect spontaneous telephone speech from subjects actually using the system. In order to maximize variation in telephone conditions, as well as ease of use for subjects, the data collection software was designed to telephone subjects at their specified phone numbers around North America. Subjects initiate the data collection session by submitting an electronic form accessible by a WWW browser. For read speech collection, a set of prompts is automatically generated for the subject. This paper describes the design of the data collection system we are using for these purposes. To date we have collected over 9,000 utterances from over 270 subjects.

INTRODUCTION One of the desiderata for our research in conversational spoken language technology is to enable mobile and affordable access to information using voice input <ref> [1] </ref>. To this end, we believe it is natural and desirable to allow telephone-based access to spoken language systems. Telephones are prevalent in our society, they are convenient and, very importantly, the average person knows how to use them properly.

Reference-contexts: Telephones are prevalent in our society, they are convenient and, very importantly, the average person knows how to use them properly. The telephone-based input model fits well with the client/server architecture used in our GALAXY system <ref> [2] </ref>. The user can be working with a lightweight client, while their voice proceeds directly without delay to a speech recognizer compute server. In addition, telephone-based input is a first step towards displayless conversational systems, another area of research we are interested in.

Subjects come to our laboratory, and interact with the system after being given GALAXY scenarios to solve. A wizard in another room listens to the queries and types them to the system, which then responds to the user.

Reference-contexts: However, since we wanted to be able to use the GALAXY system anywhere, we felt this approach suffered from a lack of variation in telephone handsets and line conditions.

The approach that we have taken is to collect data from remote users, using the internet to display either prompts or the GALAXY client for read or spontaneous data collection respectively.
