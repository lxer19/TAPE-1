Abstract: This document details the interface with the Generic Planning Architecture and gives as examples the application-specific code required in the domains of Blocks World Planning and Flight Allocation. The facilities of ECL i PS e that have used in the implementation are indicated. The current limitations of the architecture are described and future directions for development are outlined.

Reference-contexts: introduction. This is a very interesting problem theoretically, as well as being of obvious practical significance. Most planning research has offered domain-specific solutions and has been conducted in the context of resources of unit capacity, which simplifies the problem somewhat (see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>). We are currently working on a generic treatment which, if successful will also be applicable to plan repair.
