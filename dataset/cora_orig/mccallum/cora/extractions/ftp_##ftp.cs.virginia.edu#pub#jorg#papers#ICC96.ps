Abstract: A bandwidth control mechanism is proposed for ATM networks that can control the usage of bandwidth in the presence of both connection-oriented and connection-less traffic, as well as multiple classes of connectionless traffic. The bandwidth control mechanism operates at three levels. At the topmost level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between connection-oriented and connectionless traffic based on the utilization of each traffic type. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled between different classes of connectionless traffic, such as real-time traffic, bulk data traffic, and so on. At the lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among flows belonging to the same connectionless traffic class.

Reference-contexts: The protocol describes a feedback loop that involves the interworking units (IWUs) and the connectionless servers (CLSs) of the ATM network. The details of the protocol are reported elsewhere [6]. Here we wish to present experiments from a simulation program implemented using the REAL (version 4.0) network simulator <ref> [4] </ref>. We make the following assumptions in the simulations. The packet sizes are constant for all flows and set to 1056 bytes which are split into twenty-four 44-byte chunks. Propagation delays are small and set to 1 ms.

The figure depicts two graphs that show the bandwidth (in Mb/s) utilized by each flow on the two VPs, V1 and V2 .

Reference-contexts: A flow-level bandwidth control scheme dictates how to distribute the class capacity C lp to the class-p flows on a VP l. We assume that the goal of flow-level bandwidth control is to achieve max-min fairness, a scheme that was within the context of ABR traffic control <ref> [7] </ref>. Max-min fairness enforces that flows in the same class p have an identical bandwidth limit ff p (l). The value ff p (l) is referred to as the fair share of traffic class p on VP l.
