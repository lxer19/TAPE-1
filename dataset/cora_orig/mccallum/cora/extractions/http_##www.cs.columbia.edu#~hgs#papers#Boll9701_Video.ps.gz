Reference-contexts: Thus data of such a source may get lost, unless the source distribution is appropriately controlled by the network. 3.2 An Analytical Source Model Numerous video source models can be found in the literature. They may be divided into two groups. The first group <ref> [ 3, 14, 11] </ref> describes sources of video conference scenarios. There is only little motion in the sequences, and there are very few scene changes. The second group [ 9, 4, 11, 21] uses sequences from entertainment television, sports etc. Those are characterized by much motion and frequent scene changes. <p> JPEG and H.261, used with the videoconference tool vic with picture contents moving slightly.

According to the simulations in [ 18], the MCR is set here to 1/100 of the link bandwidth. This value corresponds to about 40 cells per frame. According to <ref> [ 3] </ref>, less than 10% of all frames in a video sequence are smaller than 40 cells. Therefore, it may be a good value in order to reject connect requests whose acceptance by the network would probably not be suitable. <p> The number of cells per frame n c only parameter that is varied. According to <ref> [3] </ref>, a value of n c =130 can be taken as close to reality for video conference scenarios. In order to increase the load, simulations with a higher n c made, too.

Reference-contexts: As result we will get the input for our test of acceptability for human users (section 5.5). 5.2 Simulation Environment 5.2.1 Simulation Configurations There are some configurations proposed in the literature which are useful for simulation of ATM networks. Configuration A (figure 7) <ref> [7] </ref> is used in order to investigate the behavior of a network with multiple ABR controlled video connections. The sources are denoted by S, the destinations by D. The video sources, S1 (wide area) and S2 (local), are located at different distances, that is, delay from the switch.

For investigating the fairness at the presence of one video source in a persistent sources network configuration B (figure 8) <ref> [9] </ref> was used. Here the VC to transmit video data (S1-D1) runs over three links each of them background-loaded by a persistent source.

Reference-contexts: The explicit rate feedback is more suitable for video transmission than the binary feedback because it is able to provide smaller cell loss rates. Also, it attempts to achieve the goal of max-min fairness for the source rates, while operating the bottleneck links efficiently. (Compare <ref> [11] </ref>) With an a p-propriate switch rate-allocation mechanism (e. g. EPRCA [ 19]) the computational overhead of explicit rate feedback is not very high. For these reasons, this study no longer deals with binary feedback. regularly inserts RM cells into the data cell stream. <p> Thus data of such a source may get lost, unless the source distribution is appropriately controlled by the network. 3.2 An Analytical Source Model Numerous video source models can be found in the literature.

We think that the first group is appropriate to use future low cost connections which will probably provide the ABR service only, but not CBR or VBR. <p> The cond i-tional replenishment feature used by certain video coders can do this. For our trace we used a codec that supports conditional replenishment, namely the H.261 codec. It is preferred for video conference sources, whereas the MPEG codec is to be used for high motion videos <ref> [11] </ref>. To get the trace we established a connection using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). The sending application vic encoded the frames taken from the video grabber card and put it onto the network. Another workstation traced occurrence time and size of these RTP packets using rtpdump. <p> Nevertheless, because our wide area delay is only 8 msec, interactivity is preserved. For minimizing the quality loss an effective rate adaptation system is necessary. The proposed a p-proach may be improved by optimizing some of its parameters dynamically. Furthermore, a frame prediction scheme as proposed in <ref> [11] </ref> may be introduced, and the encoder control may be e x-tended to support both frame rate and quantizer step size alteration. Another aspect is the network configuration. The behavior of a network with much more than two or three VCs per link transmitting video should be investigated, too.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we will concentrate on this group. The number of bits/packets/cells per frame is the main parameter of most models. Together with the frame rate a video source is sufficiently determined by the distribution function of this param e-ter. The ATM-Forum recommended a source model for ABR service evaluation <ref> [12] </ref> that is designed for asynchronous transmission. According to this model, a source has active and idle periods. During the active period it is sending packets of constant or geometrically distributed length. In ATM networks these packets are divided into cells. The pause periods between the packets are exponentially distributed. <p> In [ 3] some different precise models for this parameter are presented. According to [ 3] as a first a p-proximation we can use for it the gamma distribution. Nevertheless we decided to use the ge o-metric distribution because it is recommended by the ATM Forum <ref> [ 12] </ref> for use in an ABR env i-ronment. So we get our results being comparable to those from other researchers in the ABR service field who will probably use the geometric distribution.

Reference-contexts: Special attention should be paid to the switches. They have to modify the RM cells according to their congestion state. There are currently certain switch mechanisms proposed [19]. These mechanisms compute the explicit rate put into the RM cell. We used the Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm (EPRCA) <ref> [ 16] </ref>, since it provides good fairness and requires not too much computational overhead. The EPRCA scheme computes a mean allowed cell rate (MACR) using exponential weighted averaging.

Reference-contexts: At the end we will depict our impression of looking at a real video sequence transmitted over our simulated ABR channel.

A flow control mechanism (see next section) is specified which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. <p> Ronald Bollow: ABR Video Transmission 20 Berlin University of Technology The ABR source simulator has to set up the connection parameters, to send out the forward RM cells and to maintain the ACR based on the content of the backward RM cells. Because the Traffic Management Specification <ref> [17] </ref> was under development in the ATM-Forum, the source had to be modified in conformity with the latest version of the specification. Certain parameters (ADTF, CRM, CDF, TCR) were added to the source. Furthermore, the rate increase/decrease mechanism was redefined. <p> The only task of this module is to reply the forward RM cells. Therefore no changes were necessary due to the change of <ref> [17] </ref>. Special attention should be paid to the switches. They have to modify the RM cells according to their congestion state. There are currently certain switch mechanisms proposed [19]. These mechanisms compute the explicit rate put into the RM cell.

The simulation time is 1.0 sec which is much more than the transient period. According to the simulations in <ref> [ 18] </ref>, the MCR is set here to 1/100 of the link bandwidth. This value corresponds to about 40 cells per frame. According to [ 3], less than 10% of all frames in a video sequence are smaller than 40 cells.

Reference-contexts: This would be nice because ABR connections will probably be the future low-cost offers of network providers. Likely, there may be designed a new ABR-like ATM service for the special needs of video sources as proposed in <ref> [21] </ref>. However, we preferred to use an established standard. The problem is that video data can be buffered only a very limited time because the video decoder must have received all data fragments of a frame if the time to show the last frame is up. <p> They may be divided into two groups. The first group [ 3, 14, 11] describes sources of video conference scenarios. There is only little motion in the sequences, and there are very few scene changes. The second group <ref> [ 9, 4, 11, 21] </ref> uses sequences from entertainment television, sports etc. Those are characterized by much motion and frequent scene changes. We think that the first group is appropriate to use future low cost connections which will probably provide the ABR service only, but not CBR or VBR.
