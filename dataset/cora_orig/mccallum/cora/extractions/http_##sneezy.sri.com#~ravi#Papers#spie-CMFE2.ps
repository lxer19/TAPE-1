Abstract: Texture is an important preattentive cue in region-based segmentation of images. In this paper, we provide an objective comparison of the properties of the Gabor functions and the circular-Mellin features for texture segmentation. The Gabor functions provide a spectral decomposition of a windowed image about a unique spatial frequency in the Cartesian coordinate system. The circular-Mellin operators represent the spectral decomposition of the image scene in the polar-log coordinate system and are invariant to both scale and orientation of the target. Coupled with the unique shift invariance property of the correlator architecture, these circular-Mellin operators can be used for rotation- and scale-invariant feature extraction. We note that while both these feature extractors have similar functional form, the distortion-invariant characteristics of the circular-Mellin operators make them preferable for texture segmentation. Segmentation results to demonstrate their salient properties are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Segmentation of an image into regions that are homogenous with respect to a particular perceptual property is an important task in several image understanding applications, and thus has received considerable attention during the past two decades <ref> [1] </ref>. Linear filtering is a common approach to extract local texture properties from images. Studies in linear filter design theory [2] show that it is possible to design and optimize local linear filters for maximal texture discrimination.

In a typical texture segmentation problem, the location, orientation and scale of the textures are all unknown. <p> We would then expect to use a bank of circular-Mellin features in a multichannel setup [7,23]. Likewise, one could also study the significance of measures based on the responses of a bank of such filters <ref> [13] </ref>. With very little effort, many of these prior techniques can be easily extended to incorporate circular-Mellin functions as their texture operators.

Reference-contexts: These circular-Mellin features correspond to 1 Fourier features in the polar-log domain. The polar-log coordinate transformation is used to achieve rotation and scale invariance, similar to the attractive properties offered by the chord transformation <ref> [14] </ref> approach proposed by Krose. From neurophysiological studies, it has also been reported [15] that the responses of single cells of Macaque monkey showed preference to polar rather than to Cartesian gratings. The correlator architecture is used to achieve translation invariance.

Reference-contexts: This orientation dependence problem with the Gabor functions has been acknowledged and several solutions have been proposed. One popular solution is to use measures that depend on the sum of the features extracted from Gabor functions at different orientations, and the resultant sum is orientation invariant <ref> [16] </ref>. It has also been suggested that the "orientation spectrum" (a profile of the features extracted by Gabor functions at different orientations) of a texture predicts its salience [17]; the rotation of a texture pattern would merely cause its "orientation spectrum" to undergo a cyclic shift.

Reference-contexts: All of our results use only one circular-Mellin feature for segmentation to highlight their properties, although more than one feature is required for more complicated problems <ref> [18] </ref>. The steps involved in segmentation using one circular-Mellin operator is identical to those involved with the Gabor function in our earlier tests (in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). For each circular-Mellin feature extractor, a correlation plane of the texture operator with the input image is first generated.

Reference-contexts: The magnitude response of a correlation filter is rotation-invariant if it can be expressed in the polar-log coordinate system as [19,20] h (; ) = h q () exp (jq): (6) Similarly, a scale-invariant magnitude response is obtained if the filter is of the form <ref> [20] </ref> h (; ) = exp () exp (j2p)h p (): (7) Let us now examine the basic structure of Eq. (6) and Eq. (7). Both of these equations are separable in and coordinates.

Reference-contexts: However, for the same texture, variations in the output correlation plane magnitude are still noticed due to the different choices of the COE i within a tile of the texture <ref> [21] </ref>. To eliminate these differences in feature values, we performed a local averaging within smaller segments in the correlation plane.

Reference-contexts: Finally a simple thresholding algorithm is used in the output plane to segment different textures. We now demonstrate the use of circular Mellin features to segment pairs of Brodatz texture <ref> [22] </ref> in the input scene. For all test images at resolutions shown in Fig. 1 (a), the tile size is of the order of 10-12 pixels and hence the local region for averaging is chosen to be 32 fi 32 pixels to obtain reasonable average estimates.

Reference-contexts: Once the texture has been identified, one can use oriented filters or other schemes to identify the orientation of the different texture patterns in the input, to complement the teture segmentation results. A recent review of early vision research by Bela Julesz <ref> [24] </ref>, notes that texture segmentation is not governed by global (statistical) rules, but rather depends on local, nonlinear features. It is believed that the visual system applies some local spatial filtering followed by some nonlinearity, and these results are used again by the next spatial filter stage.

Reference-contexts: Currently, our linear filters and the postprocessing used lack this interesting perceptual quality of human vision. Another discussion regarding the inadequacies of purely linear mechanisms by Malik and Perona <ref> [25] </ref> concerns the use of magnitude detection (full-wave rectification) as a nonlinear mechanism after the linear filtering stage. <p> Examples of such textures have been presented elsewhere <ref> [25] </ref>, and half-wave rectification has been proposed as an alternate approach to overcome this difficulty. We are currently considering simple schemes to extract such useful information from the phase component to complement the segmentation results obtained from our approach.
