Abstract: The increasing use of high-speed networks in mission safety critical applications has led to a growing concern for reliability issues in network design. The conventional approaches to evaluating network reliability in terms of their connectivity or mean time to failure are often not sufficient to characterize the network reliability. A better measure of system reliability should quantitatively reflect traffic carrying capacity of the network in the presence of faults. In this paper, we present a probabilistic analysis of the available bandwidth of FDDI-based reconfigurable networks given the number of link faults. Three networks of varying degree of reconfigurability are considered: fully reconfigurable, partially reconfigurable, and non-reconfigurable networks. The partially reconfigurable networks are found to be an excellent compromise between high reliability and the ease of implementation. A method of implementing the partially reconfigurable network using existing FDDI technology is proposed.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on the available bandwidth as a measure of the reliability of a network. We selected FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) networks for this study. FDDI is an ANSI standard for a 100 Mbits/sec fiber optic token ring network <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. FDDI is suitable for mission safety critical applications not only because of its high bandwidth but also due to its bounded access time and its dual loop architecture. Many new civil and military networks are being developed based on the skeleton of FDDI.

Reference-contexts: Due to the space limitation, the proof of the theorem is not presented here. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [8] </ref> for it. However, the theorem can be intuitively explained as follows. When the wrap up option is not used, obviously, the available bandwidth is at most (r h n ) units, where h n is the number of damages in the maximally damaged bunch. <p> An approach would be to derive the distribution or the expectation of order statistics for these random variables. For a more detailed discussion on these issues, see <ref> [8] </ref>. 4 Conclusions In this paper we proposed the use of multiple FDDI rings with reconfigurable architecture. Our objective is to provide a significant improvement over the standard FDDI networks in terms of connectivity and available bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: However, this basic configuration may not be able to tolerate two or more faults. That is, in the worst case two link faults will disconnect the network. To overcome this problem, Ralph, Ukrainsky, Schellack, and Weinberg <ref> [15] </ref> proposed an alternate path FDDI topology that uses two FDDI trunk rings. In their network, each station connects to an FDDI concentrator which subsequently connects itself to the two trunk rings. <p> A node has certain reconfiguration capability: a left link can be connected to one of m right links. This is a generalization of the traditional FDDI network and that proposed in <ref> [15] </ref>. In a traditional FDDI network, r = 1 and m = 1 while for the network considered in [15], r = 2 and m = 2. We are going to study the available bandwidth of an FBRN given that there are certain number of link faults. <p> This is a generalization of the traditional FDDI network and that proposed in <ref> [15] </ref>.
