Title: The Three-Phase Method and Applications  
Author: Therese C. Biedl 
Abstract: The three-phase method is a generic method for creating orthogonal drawings of graphs of arbitrarily high degree. We provide an overview of this method and its wide range of applications.

Reference-contexts: We know of no related results. Small number of bends All previous algorithms resulted in roughly m bends, thus on average, one bend per edge. This barrier can be broken: Theorem 3 <ref> [1] </ref> Any normalized graph has an or thogonal drawing in a grid of half-perimeter 2m n + 1 with m n + 1 bends. Planar graphs For a planar graph, we want an orthogonal drawing without crossing. <p> If there is a directed cycle of such constraints, then the system is infeasible. Otherwise, we can find an orthogonal drawing fulfilling these constraints. Theorem 7 <ref> [1] </ref> For any normalized graph and any set of non-contradictory inequality constraints, there exists an orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints in an m fi m-grid. Additionally, we can allow equality-constraints, i.e., that two nodes must share a row or a column. Theorem 8 [1] For any normalized graph and any set <p> Theorem 7 <ref> [1] </ref> For any normalized graph and any set of non-contradictory inequality constraints, there exists an orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints in an m fi m-grid. Additionally, we can allow equality-constraints, i.e., that two nodes must share a row or a column. Theorem 8 [1] For any normalized graph and any set of non-contradictory equality and inequality constraints, there exists an orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints in a grid of half-perimeter 3m+n with at most 3 bends per edge We know of no related results. <p> Three-dimensional drawings The three-phase method generalizes to three dimen sions, and we can achieve the following result: Theorem 9 <ref> [1] </ref> Any normalized graph has a crossing-free 3D orthogonal drawing in an nfinfim grid with 2 bends per edge.

Reference-contexts: Also, all algorithms work in linear time, and, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, yield at most one bend per edge. Small area One objective for drawings is a small area. Theorem 1 <ref> [2] </ref> Any normalized graph has an orthogonal drawing in an m+n 2 fi m+n 2 -grid. The previous best algorithm gave an (m 1) fi ( m 2 + 2)-grid and m 1 bends [5], though in a different model. <p> The previous best algorithm gave an (m 1) fi ( m 2 + 2)-grid and m 1 bends [5], though in a different model. Bounded aspect ratio (height:width) In the previous algorithm, node boxes may be badly proportioned. This can be improved as follows: Theorem 2 <ref> [2] </ref> Any normalized graph has an orthogonal drawing in a n ( 3 4 m + n 4 m + n 2 )-grid such that each node has aspect ratio at most 1:2. We know of no related results. <p> This barrier can be broken: Theorem 3 [1] Any normalized graph has an or thogonal drawing in a grid of half-perimeter 2m n + 1 with m n + 1 bends. Planar graphs For a planar graph, we want an orthogonal drawing without crossing. Theorem 4 <ref> [2] </ref> Any triconnected planar graph has an orthogonal planar drawing in an (m n + 1) fi minfm n + 1; m 2 g-grid with m n bends. <p> The previous best result here was an m fi m-grid and m bends [4]. 1 Incremental drawings Sometimes, a graph is given incrementally node-by-node, and we want a drawing of each partial graph, which should undergo only local changes as new nodes are being added. Theorem 5 <ref> [2] </ref> For an incrementally given graph, we can maintain an orthogonal drawing in an ( m 2 + 3 m + n)-grid. In interactive drawings, we also want to delete nodes, to add or delete edges, and to move nodes. <p> number of bends be improved further? In particular, is there an algorithm that yields roughly an m 2 fi m 2 -grid and m n bends, both for planar and non planar graphs? * What are the lower bounds? A lower bound of m 6n + 12 bends is known <ref> [2] </ref>, but what is a lower bound on the area? * How can we handle other types of constraints?

Reference-contexts: The problem with both these approaches is that we must decide the order of the edges around each node, and find space for the boxes. 2 The three-phase method A third approach to create drawings of high-degree graphs is the three-phase method presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. The three phases are called node placement, edge routing and port assignment. In this approach, we first create an infeasible drawing, called a sketch. Thus, we first draw nodes as points and route edges with intersections and overlaps between edges and nodes permitted. <p> Theorem 5 [2] For an incrementally given graph, we can maintain an orthogonal drawing in an ( m 2 + 3 m + n)-grid. In interactive drawings, we also want to delete nodes, to add or delete edges, and to move nodes.

Many open problems remain in this field.
