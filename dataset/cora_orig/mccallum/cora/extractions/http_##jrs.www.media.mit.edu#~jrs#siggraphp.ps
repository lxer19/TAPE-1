Reference-contexts: However, the interaction soon begins to feel transparent, natural, and ordinary, rather than magical|why shouldn't you be able to indicate your intentions to an object by waving your hands at it? Hume, in his famous argument on the impossibility of miracles <ref> [2] </ref>, says that the scope of the ordinary or natural can always be enlarged to subsume "magical" phenomena.

Reference-contexts: The same sensing circuitry can be used in several different ways. Shunt mode uses pairs of electrodes. A low frequency ( 50kHz) sinusoidal signal is applied to the transmit electrode, and, using synchronous detection, a measurement is made of the nano- to micro-amp displacement current <ref> [3] </ref> arriving at the receive electrode. (The sensors can also be used in two other modes, loading or transmit, but we will focus on shunt mode, since it is most relevant for creating active objects.) When a hand is placed above the transmitter and receiver, some of the displacement current is
