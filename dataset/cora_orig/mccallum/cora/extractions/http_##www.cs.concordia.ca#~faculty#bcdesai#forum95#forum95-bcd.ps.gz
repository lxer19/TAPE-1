Abstract: It is well known that selectivity leaves a lot to be desired in searching for information resources on the Internet with existing search systems[DESA4]. This has prompted a number of researchers to turn their attention to the development and implementation of models for indexing and searching information resources on the Internet. In this white paper 2 we examine briefly the results of a simple query on a number of existing search systems and then discuss two proposed index metadata structures for indexing and supporting search and discovery: the Dublin Core Elements List and the Semantic Header.

Reference-contexts: Each occurrence of this group consists of two sub-fields: one for the domain and the other for the corresponding value. The domain could be an accepted or standardized coding scheme issued by an ap propriate authority such as ISBN, ISSN, URL (FTP, GOPHER, HTTP) <ref> [BERN1] </ref> , or URN [RFC1737] etc., and the value contains the corresponding coded identifier. Since a re source in electronic form may be accessible from one or more sites there could be one or more entries for the same domain such as URL.

Reference-contexts: This phenomena has been observed in distributed information systems which, even though under control of a single administrative unit, create multiple problems typically caused by differences in semantics and representation, and incomplete and incorrect data dictionaries (cataloging) <ref> [DESA] </ref> . These problems would be magnified manyfold in any distributed information system which tries to integrate the resources offered by indexing and search systems over the Internet.

Reference-contexts: In the following sections, we present two recent initiatives for allowing suppliers of resources to prepare well thought out catalog information for their resources. Dublin Metadata Workshop The Metadata Workshop was held from March 1 to March 3rd, 1995 in Dublin, OH <ref> [DESA3] </ref> . It was open "by invitation only" to a number of people actively involved in one or another aspect of the Digital or Virtual Library project, primarily in North America. <p> The main objective was to address the problem of cataloging network resources with adoption, extension or modification of current standards and protocols to facilitate their discovery and access. A list of participants and their affiliations is given in <ref> [DESA3] </ref> . The goals of the workshop were: to achieve a consensus on a set of core data elements for document-like objects (DLO); to map these and related elements to accepted standards; and to devise an extension scheme for registering other types of network objects.
