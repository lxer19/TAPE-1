Reference-contexts: We shall sometimes write the left-hand side of a rigid equation as a sequence of equations, for example x'a ` 8 g (x)'x instead of fx'ag ` 8 g (x)'x. In <ref> [2] </ref> it is shown that the decidability of SREU is equivalent to the decid-ability of some other fundamental problems, for example the decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality.

Best known (un)decidability results on SREU are the following: (i) SREU with ground left-hand sides, two variables and three rigid equation is undecidable (Veanes [16]); (ii) SREU with one variable is DEXPTIME-complete (Degtyarev, Gurevich, Narendran, Veanes and Voronkov [3]).

Best known (un)decidability results on SREU are the following: (i) SREU with ground left-hand sides, two variables and three rigid equation is undecidable (Veanes [16]); (ii) SREU with one variable is DEXPTIME-complete (Degtyarev, Gurevich, Narendran, Veanes and Voronkov <ref> [3] </ref>). The last two results imply a complete classification of decidable prenex fragments of intuitionistic predicate calculus with equality: the 99 fragment is undecidable and the 8 fl 98 fl fragment is decidable. All the above mentioned undecidability results require that the signature contain a function symbol of arity 2. <p> We prove Theorem 4 Monadic SREU is decidable if and only if the ideal equation problem is decidable. We also prove the decidability of some special cases of monadic SREU. In Section 4 we prove a result similar to the main result of <ref> [3] </ref>: Theorem 3 Monadic SREU with one variable is PSPACE-complete. Plaisted [13] proved that SREU with ground left-hand sides is undecidable. The corresponding monadic case is shown to be decidable in Section 3: Theorem 2 Monadic SREU with ground left-hand sides is decidable. <p> Then E (c); E (r) ` s (r) ' t (r). By Lemma 2 we can substitute r for c obtaining E (r) ` s (r) ' t (r). 2 Lemmas 16 and 17 also hold for non-monadic signatures <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 18 Monadic SREU with one variable is in PSPACE. Proof. We shall give a non-deterministic algorithm reducing monadic SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptyness of deterministic finite automata problem. Let R be a system of rigid equations of one variable x whose signature is (F; C).

Reference-contexts: The special case of SREU when all function symbols have arity 1, is called monadic SREU. The decidability of monadic SREU is an open problem. The following facts are known about monadic SREU (Degtyarev, Matiyasevich and Voronkov <ref> [4] </ref>). * The word equation problem is effectively reducible to monadic SREU. (This fact shows that if this problem is decidable, its decidability should be uneasy to prove.) * Monadic SREU with one function symbol is decidable (this fact has a non elementary proof). * Monadic SREU is decidable if and

In Lemma 9 below we show that one can consider systems of rigid w-equations instead of systems of rigid equations.

Using this notation, we can write any rigid equation of one variable x as E (x) ` 8 s (x) ' t (x).

The aim of this section is to show that monadic SREU is equivalent to the ideal equations problem. The following lemma proved in <ref> [6] </ref> is the main reason for introducing the notion of an ideal.

See <ref> [6] </ref>. Technical report [6] discusses ideal equations in more detail. In particular, it is shown that ideal equations are decidable if and only if word equations extended by a family of predicates behaving like a greatest common divisor on word are decidable. <p> Theorem 4 Monadic SREU is decidable if and only if the ideal equation problem is decidable.
