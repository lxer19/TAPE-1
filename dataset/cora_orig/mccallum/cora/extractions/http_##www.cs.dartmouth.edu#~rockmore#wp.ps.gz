Abstract: We propose the use of spectral analysis on certain noncommutative finite groups in digital signal processing, and in particular, image processing. We pay significant attention to groups constructed as wreath products of cyclic groups. Within this large class of groups our approach recovers the DFT, Haar wavelet transform, various multichannel pyramid filter banks and other aspects of multiresolution analysis as special cases of a more general phenomenon. In addition, the group structure provides a rich algebraic structure which can be exploited for the analysis and manipulation of signals. Our approach relies on a synthesis of ideas found in the early work of Holmes, Karpovsky, Trachtenberg and others on noncommutative filtering, as well as Diaconis's spectral analysis approach to understanding data.

Reference-contexts: particular attention paid to the case of two-dimensional sampling grids and the associated permutation representation on the vector space of images. 3.2.1 Generalities The applications discussed here depend on understanding the action of certain wreath product groups on a particular class of directed graphs, spherically homogenous rooted trees (SHRTs) (see <ref> [6] </ref>). Recall that a tree is a graph with no cycles. A rooted tree has a distinguished vertex, the root, and all other vertices are judged in relation to their distance from the root, measured in terms of the length of the shortest path to the root. <p> More generally, certain subgroups, also wreath products, can be obtained by choosing for each level i, a specific 3 We only concern ourselves with finite SHRTS.

Lastly, we note that by taking inverse limits of finite groups it is possible to extend some of our analysis to the setting of profinite groups acting on profinite sets (see e.g. <ref> [6, 29] </ref>) or on infinite dimensional topological vector spaces (see e.g. [58]). In this way one may be led to appropriate "continuous" signal spaces admitting group actions and multiresolutions.

Many well-known codes have natural descriptions in terms of the group algebra of a cyclic group which translate into easily stated properties of their Fourier transforms over finite fields.

If S is injective, then we think of the image of S as providing the "coarse scale" information for L (X) and the orthogonal complement as providing the detail.

This algorithm is completely analogous to the analysis algorithm, but uses inverse DFT's (which involve appropriate normalizing factors) | the details are omitted. <p> This group now offers a wealth of filters which may be applied to signals efficiently for various purposes. This is one of the significant new additions of this work.

In particular, we explore the effect of convolution of a given 2 N fi 2 N image f with various signals h. <p> The additional algebraic structure of a group theoretic approach gives the advantage of a natural collection of (noncommutative) convolution operators. When this is applied to the quadtree indexing of a digitized image, these convolution operators have great potential for pattern matching and compression. In <ref> [32] </ref> the image processing implications are examined in some detail. Other possible avenues for future work include the derivation of lapped transforms from a group theoretic point of view, multidimensional sampling, as well as the use of other nonabelian groups for digital signal processing tasks. 30

In particular, we appreciatively cite our debt to the fundamental work of R.

We shall see that these wreath product groups arise in a natural way in pyramid structured multichannel DFT filter banks (see <ref> [43] </ref> for a group theoretic approach to multidimensional filter banks). The analysis stage of these filter banks in polyphase form turns out to be the same as the Fourier transform of a tree-encoded discrete signal with respect to the action of a wreath product group.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, we note that by taking inverse limits of finite groups it is possible to extend some of our analysis to the setting of profinite groups acting on profinite sets (see e.g. [6, 29]) or on infinite dimensional topological vector spaces (see e.g. <ref> [58] </ref>). In this way one may be led to appropriate "continuous" signal spaces admitting group actions and multiresolutions. A sequence of finite groups acting on trees effectively gives the action of an automorphism group of an infinite SHRT on the infinite paths, or ends of the tree.

Our point of view is something of a hybrid of the above. Following the basic philosophy of Diaconis's spectral analysis, we hope to find appropriate symmetry groups for certain types of signals, and then study the signals via their decomposition into orthogonal projections onto group-invariant subspaces.

The proofs of results cited in this section may be found in standard references on representation theory such as <ref> [62] </ref>.

Theorem 4.2 (See e.g. <ref> [62] </ref>, Theorem 8 (ii), Section 2.6) For any f 2 L (G) the projection of f onto M k is then given by k (f )(ff) = j G j fi2G k (fffi 1 )f (fi); for all ff 2 G (4.3) where the overbar denotes complex conjugation.
