Abstract: We develop the influence graph mechanism for reasoning about and optimizing decentralized controls for distributed parameter physical systems. Distributed parameter systems, such as air flow around an airplane wing, temperature over a semiconductor wafer, and noise from a photocopy machine, are common physical phenomena. The influence graph mechanism encodes the structural dependency information in a distributed parameter system and exploits the information to (1) alleviate redundant computation and (2) reduce communication and support cooperation among local control processes. Using the mechanism, we obtained a dramatic computational speed-up in optimizing control design for a distributed temperature field.

Williams and Millar (Williams & Millar 1996) and Clancy and Kuipers <ref> (Clancy & Kuipers 1997) </ref> present two different methods for decomposing large models and reasoning about the interactions of sub-components. Our work differs from these in that it uses structural knowledge of distributed parameter fields in the form of influence graphs to guide decomposition and cooperation among decentralized optimization processes.

Reference-contexts: Unlike control design for lumped parameter linear systems, few analytic design techniques have been developed for distributed control of large physical fields (Sandell Jr. et al. 1978). In practice, the design is often accomplished by brute-force numerical computation. Among the recent experimental work in decentralized control, Doumanidis <ref> (Doumanidis 1997) </ref> addressed the problem of control parameter optimization for distributed parameter systems. He introduced a first-order approximation to local effects of heat sources during the optimization. However, his approach ignored effects of geometries and the use of structural knowledge in guiding decentralized optimization.

(c) Two tightly coupled sources. ties, boundary conditions. * Performance constraints: desired profile, optimality conditions on solutions, restriction on control sources (e.g. maximum heat output).

Reference-contexts: Optimization Using Influence Graph We will use the problem of thermal field regulation to develop the influence graph mechanism. To synthesize a control strategy for the distributed thermal field, the design process requires simultaneous optimization of many parameters (the source values). While algorithms for multi-parameter optimization exist <ref> (Press et al. 1986) </ref>, they are computationally expensive for large problems and difficult to parallelize for distributed applications. We will show how structural knowledge, in the form of the influence graph, significantly improves the performance of a basic decentralized optimization algorithm.
