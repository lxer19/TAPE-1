Abstract: This paper explores morpho-syntactic ambiguities for French to develop a strategy for part-of-speech disambiguation that a) reflects the complexity of French as an inflected language, b) optimizes the estimation of probabilities, c) allows the user flexibility in choosing a tagset. The problem in extracting lexical probabilities from a limited training corpus is that the statistical model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a particular context. In a highly morphologically inflected language, this argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number of parts of speech. Due to the lack of sufficient training data, we argue against estimating lexical probabilities to disambiguate parts

Large Num. Short of occ. Tagset Description of occ. <p> In the spectrum of parts of speech taggers as described above, the originality of our work lies in the linguistic nuances and subtleties that are encoded in the system. Part of speech taggers could be divided in two categories, these which discriminate simple part of speech categories, such as <ref> (Church, 1989) </ref> and (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) and those like (Voutilainen, 1993), which detect noun phrases. Like Voutilainen's system, ours provides more morpho-syntactic information and therefore tackles more of the linguistic ambiguities.

When low frequency words occur with equal part-of-speech distribution, it is hardly possible to pick the right part-of-speech. Using 8 EVELYNE TZOUKERMANN ET AL.

Tagset Description of occ. <p> Since rules are acquired automatically, a small training corpus cannot provide enough empirical data for the acquisition of a large number of rules.

The constraints can be 100% accurate or describe the tendency of a particular tagging choice.
