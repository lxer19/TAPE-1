Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sending an encoded video stream over a channel of limited bandwidth. When there is insufficient bandwidth available, some data must be dropped. For many video encodings, some data are more important that others, leading to a natural prioritization of the data. In this paper we give fast algorithms to determine a prioritization which optimizes the visual quality of the received data. By "optimized visual quality," we mean that the expected maximum interval of unplayable frames is minimized. Our results are obtained in a model of encoded video data that is applicable to many encoding technologies. The highlight of the model is an interesting relationship between the play order and dependence order of frames. The property allows fast determination of optimal send orders by dynamic programming and is satisfied by all MPEG sequences.

Reference-contexts: A third consideration is that over traditional networks, available bandwidth may be highly variable, depending on network charac teristics such as link capacities and network load. These observations have lead many researchers to develop prioritized transmission schemes. For example, Priority Encoded Transmission (PET) <ref> [1] </ref> uses a variation on forward error correction where redundant data is introduced to compensate for data loss. Priority is encoded by associating high redundancy with more important frames. Cyclic-UDP [6] uses a retransmission scheme that allows for prioritized delivery.

Reference-contexts: A more common approach, popular with the signal processing community, is spatial decimation. This takes the form of dropping the least significant coefficients of the Fourier or cosine transform of the image <ref> [2] </ref>. As more data are dropped, the image degrades by 2 developing a halo around the edges of objects, called the corona effect. This approach is highly dependent on the coding method and data format, whereas the temporal approach is relatively independent of the particular coding method.

Reference-contexts: Priority is encoded by associating high redundancy with more important frames. Cyclic-UDP [6] uses a retransmission scheme that allows for prioritized delivery. Reservation networks such as Tenet <ref> [3] </ref> allow users to reserve bandwidth in the network, with statistical guarantees on the transmission properties of the packets. Prioritized delivery can be obtained using several channels.

Reference-contexts: Determining which frames to drop is easy if all frames are the same size and there are no dependencies, as with the example above. However, the problem is significantly more complicated without these restrictions. Such is the case with the MPEG encoding standard <ref> [4] </ref>. Dependencies between frames arise because frames that are very similar to neighboring frames are not represented in their entirety, but encoded succinctly as modifications to neighboring frames.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned, the problem we solve in this paper is part of an approach to the general problem called temporal decimation, in which selected frames are dropped from the encoded sequence of frames. The missing frames are filled in by replaying the latest decoded frame or by interpolation <ref> [5] </ref>. As more frames are dropped, the image degrades by developing a jerkiness, depending on the sizes of the gaps between playable frames and the quality of the interpolation process.

This assumption is realistic, since there exist techniques to measure the channel bandwidth at any instant of time quite reliably <ref> [6] </ref>. The algorithm computes in time O (pmn 3 ) an optimal order to transmit the frames, where p is the size of the interval. The order is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the expected maximum interval of unplayable frames.
