Reference-contexts: The limitations of simplified robot simulators are well understood [2, 10]. A number of attempts have been made to create faithful mobile robot simulators <ref> [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9] </ref>. All of these approaches have in common that sensory perception is modelled by simplified mathematical equations generating the simulated data. In c 1.1 What is being modelled? The purpose of mobile robot simulation is to model the interaction of a robot with its environment.

Reference-contexts: Most existing mobile robot simulators use simplified models of sensory perception and action; typically, computer graphics techniques are used to represent a simulated environment and the robot while deterministic and generic equations are used to model sensory perception and actuation <ref> [3, 6] </ref>. The limitations of simplified robot simulators are well understood [2, 10]. A number of attempts have been made to create faithful mobile robot simulators [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9].

The purpose of mobile robot simulation is to model the interaction of a robot with its environment. It is, therefore, "important to remember that it is not our world that is being simulated, but the robot's" <ref> [4] </ref>. This is one reason why it is desirable to model the world as the robot actually sees it.

Reference-contexts: A second reason is that there are perceptual discrepancies between the human's observation of the world and the robot's. "The human designer inevitably has a very different perception of the world compared with the robot's view" <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore, we contend that faithful robot simulation should be based on the robot's perception of its environment, rather than the human's perception of the robot's environment.
