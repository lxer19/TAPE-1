Reference-contexts: First, we will expand the data comparison functionality to support more general operations, particularly general linear combinations of two or more data sets. We are also planning to incorporate the communication mechanisms provided by the ALICE Memory Snooper <ref> [1] </ref>, so that the ADE toolkit will be able to dynamically retrieve data from multiple time steps of an ongoing simulation, allowing the application scientist to monitor the progress of the application's solution and to investigate the differences between time steps.

Reference-contexts: The numerical simulations were performed with the commercial computational fluid dynamics package FLUENT <ref> [2] </ref>. The computational mesh used for each simulation consisted of a static, logically regular grid containing roughly 90,000 cells. In this case the mesh used for each simulation was identical; only the boundary conditions were changed to model the three different fuel types.

Reference-contexts: As each technique is described, its use is illustrated in the context of the aluminum smelting furnace application. The display device used with this toolkit is the CAVE immersive virtual reality system <ref> [3] </ref>, and we briefly describe the interactive environment and user interface in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we offer concluding remarks and directions for future development of the ADE toolkit. 2 A MOTIVATING APPLICATION: ALUMINUM SMELTING FURNACE EFFICIENCY Recently, the U.S. <p> profiles are colored by temperature in the leftmost image and by source in the middle and rightmost image. 8 4 THE INTERACTIVE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT The display device used with this application is based on the CAVE technology developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago <ref> [3] </ref>. Users are immersed in the virtual environment by stepping into a ten-foot cube that has stereo images projected onto three walls and the floor. Several users may be immersed simultaneously in the same virtual environment and interact with the same computational model.

Reference-contexts: In addition, to create a natural interaction paradigm with the various toolkit options, we are using a "control panel" GUI interface developed at Argonne National Laboratory <ref> [4] </ref>. This GUI interface is written in openInventor and C++ and provides a simple API for creating toggle buttons, single and multi-selectable button rows, and sliders. Multiple control panels can be created and are selected by clicking on a tab identifier.

Reference-contexts: These methods fall into two primary categories: image comparison and data comparison. Image comparisons are performed either by displaying data set images side by side in the same visualization coordinate system, or, more directly, by computing the difference in the image produced by the visualization tools <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Shortcomings of this technique include the fact that subtle differences are difficult to discern, particularly in side by side comparisons. In addition, different visualization techniques operating on the same data set can produce spurious differences unrelated to the underlying data set [5]. <p> Shortcomings of this technique include the fact that subtle differences are difficult to discern, particularly in side by side comparisons. In addition, different visualization techniques operating on the same data set can produce spurious differences unrelated to the underlying data set <ref> [5] </ref>. The second approach to comparative visualization, data comparison, is performed by creating an intermediate data set by combining information from two or more data sources and visualizing the resulting "differenced" data set. <p> This technique has been used successfully to compare simulation and experimental data [8, 6, 7] and also to compare the data produced by different visualization algorithms, such as volume rendering techniques <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we describe a toolkit that incorporates a combination of comparative visualization techniques for analyzing multiple data sets arising from numerical simulations. This toolkit, called the ALICE Differencing Engine (ADE), was motivated by a joint project between the U.S.
