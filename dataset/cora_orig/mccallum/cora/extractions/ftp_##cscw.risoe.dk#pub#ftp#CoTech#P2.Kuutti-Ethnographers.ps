Abstract: handing over the results or joining Abstract. The paper continues the discussion about the role of ethnography in system design from the viewpoint of system designers. It suggests that ethnographically-inspired methods can be useful in system design also when used by system designers, but that system designers might also contribute something in deeper ethnographical analysis because of their firm connection to the material world and technology. The suggestions are illustrated by an example from a fieldwork done in studying radiological conferences. Finally, the paper suggests that ethnography might help in developing rich categories and concepts to describe future work practices. forces?

Reference-contexts: All their types are founded on "debriefing meetings" where results of ethnography are informed to the designers. Recently, however, two interesting papers: "Representations and Requirements: The Value of Ethnography in System Design" by R. Anderson <ref> (Anderson 1994) </ref> and "The limits of Ethnography: Combining Social Sciences for CSCW" by D. Shapiro (Shapiro 1994) have opened a debate on the nature and purpose of ethnography in system design and also on the possible directions of future development. <p> are designing; and focus on the intersection of the technological, the organizational, and the social dimensions of the working environments within which their designed systems will find a place, all without ever engaging in the kind of analytical ethnography (hereafter, just ethnography) to be found in so - cial sciences". <ref> (Anderson 1994, 154-155.) </ref> 1 Anderson criticises sharply the conception that ethnography could be reduced in the form of data collection and its essence in such a way forgotten: "It is this transparency of translation that many (both in the systems world and outside it) have misunderstood. <p> They have no doubt that it is difficult, skilful, and re - quires certain orders of talents that most "systems people" do not possess. But, at bottom, it is just a methodology and hence akin to all other methodologies of requirements capture. Nothing could be further from the truth." <ref> (Anderson 1994, 160.) </ref> 1 Andersons concern that designers might be "taking over" ethnography from the hands of professional ethnographers seems to be premature: we know only one account (Simonsen and Kensing 1994) where system designers are using the term without the direct involvement and control by "true" ethnographers themselves. <p> Data, observations, stories are important only as means to working through and working out the analytic possibilities currently in view. In this sense, the supposi - tion that ethnography conveys an overall impression of "what life is like" or "tells it as it is" is profoundly mistaken." <ref> (Anderson 1994, pp. 154-155.) </ref> After chastising this way the level of discussion around ethnography Anderson proceeds in explaining potential reasons for such a profound misunderstanding, and explaining the true nature of ethnography as a cultural translation, where ethnographer helps us to see the world around us in a different light by <p> This can inform design by opening the play of possibilities and different rationalities involved in design. "Analytic ethnographies can make a contribution to design that may deliberately question con - ventional frames of reference" <ref> (Anderson 1994, p. 179) </ref>. "...local logics are the resources that the actors in those settings use to make sense of the activities happening around them. As such, they are deeply embedded in work practices and work communities. <p> As such, they are deeply embedded in work practices and work communities. By tuning to this plurality, design can take up the opportunities offered by the play of rationalities and the design "solu - tions" that go with the grain of local logics than against them" <ref> (Anderson 1994, p. 177.) </ref> Continuing the discussion First, we don't feel ourselves competent enough to be involved in the struggle what is true ethnography and what is not. <p> The importance of material world is clearly recognized by such researchers like Suchman (Suchman 1993) and Goodwin (Goodwin forthcoming). Some others like Anderson (joining Latour) want to "bring technology back in, but in a ways that do not subvert, demean, or marginalize it" <ref> ( Anderson 1994) </ref>, p. 166). This is certainly a major step towards a more balanced view . However, there is still a danger to slip into a narrow and biased interpretation. <p> It is important to maintain this intentionality and objectoriented - ness and not look only at the technological surface or "artifact's engagement with us in the social world" <ref> (Anderson 1994, p. 167) </ref>. 3) We would like to question the efficiency of "handing over" or "debriefing" ways to handle the material and results from field studies. <p> It may do so, for instance, by playing through the possibility that a num - ber of differing rationalities are on view in any work setting." <ref> (Anderson 1994, p. 170.) </ref> The offer would be a valuable one indeed, if system design would be totally unaware of the existence of different rationalities or badly incapable of identify - ing them. <p> at the level of rationalities is too general to be useful and on the other hand the purity of Ethnography still demands resisting the horrors of any prescription or, using a nice expression by Anderson, ethnogra - phers "are not presumptuous enough to offer to do designers' thinking by them" <ref> (Anderson 1994, p. 177) </ref> what it is they can do for design? We think that there is one area where "true" Ethnography could made a valu - able contribution, and it can be found by elaborating Anderson's "space of possi - bilities" a bit further, by proceeding to a "zone of

Reference-contexts: further, by proceeding to a "zone of proximal development" "Zone of proximal development is ... the distance between the present everyday actions of the individuals and the historically new form of societal activity that can be collectively generated as a solution to the double bind potentially embedded in everyday actions." <ref> (Engestrm 1987 , p. 174) </ref> This particular concept is loaded by special assumptions of the relationships between actions and the potential ways through the zone.

Reference-contexts: Enabling this has been interpreted to require the involvement of social scientists professional ethnographers into system design as by and far best qualified to do the job. "[Designers] are all amateur ethnographers ... this is all rather ad hoc. There is a case for professional ethnography." <ref> (Randall, Bentley et al. 1994, p. 26.) </ref> It is generally thought that they will first "go out" and study work practices at hand as they would study any other social phenomenon and then "hand the findings over" to system designers to be interpreted and used some way.
