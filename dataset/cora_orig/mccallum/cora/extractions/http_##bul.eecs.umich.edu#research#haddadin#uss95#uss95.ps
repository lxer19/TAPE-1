Abstract: We present a new distorted Born iterative algorithm for diffraction tomography which introduces kernel distortions only at carefully selected pixel locations. This algorithm attains the performance levels achieved by existing distorted Born iterative techniques, while maintaining the robustness of the Born iterative technique, especially in noisy situations. In addition, the algorithm has lower computational complexity and faster convergence rate when compared with existing distorted Born iterative algorithms. We present numerical simulations of the algorithm in noisy and noise-free environments. We also discuss an elementary experimental setup which is being used to validate our tomographic imaging algorithms.
