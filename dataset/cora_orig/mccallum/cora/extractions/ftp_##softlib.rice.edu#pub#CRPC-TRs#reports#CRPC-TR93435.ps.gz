Reference-contexts: In particular, a processor cannot simultaneously receive more than one message. However, we assume that any processor can send a message simultaneously to all its neighbors. The communication process is thus whispering for the reception, and shouting for the emission <ref> [1] </ref>. Moreover, a processor cannot simultaneously send and receive. <p> Besides its many applications in linear algebra, the successive broadcasts problem is interesting by itself. In particular it could be of first interest to study this problem on other topologies as grids and meshes, and under other communication constraints as specified in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We are now ready to give our allocation and broadcasting strategies. Allocation strategy Our allocation uses the Binary Reflected Gray Code sequence BRGC (d) = fx (1) ; x (2) ; : : : ; x (2 d ) g (see for instance <ref> [3] </ref>). Recall that BRGC (1) = f0; 1g and BRGC (d) = f0BRGC (d 1); 1BRGC (d 1)g where BRGC (d) denotes BRGC (d) in the reverse order. For instance BRGC (2) = f00; 01; 11; 10g and BRGC (3) = f000; 001; 011; 010; 110; 111; 101; 100g.

Reference-contexts: To prove this proposition, we need to recall the definition of a spanning binomial tree of an hypercube, and its different rotations (see <ref> [4] </ref>). 6 Definition. The spanning binomial tree rooted at a vertex x of Q d is denoted SBT (x). <p> Figure 1 shows SBT (000); SBT (011) and R 1 (SBT (011)) in Q 3 . 7 Any of the trees R j (SBT (x)); j = 0; : : :; d1 can be used for broadcasting a message from x <ref> [4] </ref>: at each step, the message is sent from all the vertices at the same level in the tree simultaneously to all their children in the tree. The levels are labeled from 0 to d, the root being the only vertex of level 0.
