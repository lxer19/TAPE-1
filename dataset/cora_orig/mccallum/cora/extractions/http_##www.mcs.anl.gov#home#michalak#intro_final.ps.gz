Abstract: This special issue on "Regional weather models" complements the Oc-tober 1995 special issue on "Climate and weather modeling", which focused on global models. In this introduction we review the similarities and differences between regional and global atmospheric models. Next, the structure of regional models is described and we consider how the basic algorithms applied in these models influence the parallelization strategy. Finally, we give a brief overview of the eight articles in this issue and discuss some remaining challenges in the area of adopting regional weather models to parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this problem, semi-Lagrangian time integration schemes have become popular in atmospheric models. (In other disciplines, these schemes are referred to as Eulerian-Lagrangian methods or the modified method of characteristics.) Semi-Lagrangian schemes are unconditionally stable for advection problems, although the presence of forcing terms may introduce stability restrictions <ref> [1] </ref>. Furthermore, semi-Lagrangian schemes require a factor of five to ten times more floating-point operations per grid-point per time step than the leap-frog scheme [1]. <p> Eulerian-Lagrangian methods or the modified method of characteristics.)

Furthermore, semi-Lagrangian schemes require a factor of five to ten times more floating-point operations per grid-point per time step than the leap-frog scheme [1]. Nevertheless, semi-Lagrangian schemes are efficient from a computational point of view if the time step can be substantially increased and/or the physics and the treatment of the fast moving waves account for a sufficiently large part of the total number of operations.

Reference-contexts: As Foster points out, it is also desirable from a software perspective to use existing sequential physics packages without modification, since these are the parts most liable to change over the life of the model code <ref> [4] </ref>. Dynamics, however, does entail significant horizontal data dependencies. For explicit Eulerian finite-difference schemes, communication involves exchanging data between edges of neighboring subdomains.

Reference-contexts: The exchanges may be implemented using direct calls to a message-passing library such as MPI <ref> [5] </ref> or using higher-level stencil communication libraries developed for the purpose. Two papers, by Bjorge and Skalin and by Thomas et al., explore semi-Lagrangian alternatives to Eule-rian methods.

Reference-contexts: Assimilation schemes include Newtonian nudging [17], optimal interpolation (OI), and four-dimensional variational assimilation. Four-dimensional data assimilation can, however, add significantly to the cost of a simulation; moreover, it requires efficient parallel input and may introduce additional load imbalance. <ref> [9] </ref>. Nesting schemes in parallel models provide an efficient way of concentrating resolution over subregions in a forecast.

Reference-contexts: The cost of input and output to a parallel weather model is a serious impediment to performance and, especially, scalability. Scalable I/O will become an increasing concern.

We also refer to a recent special issue of Parallel Computing [18] for further information on parallel I/O.

Reference-contexts: Specialized time integration schemes are required in compressible atmospheric models to overcome the stability constraints. Even when the limitation imposed by the fast-moving waves is removed, the time step will be determined by stability rather than accuracy <ref> [16] </ref>. Hence, valuable computational resources are spent for operations that do not improve the forecast.

Reference-contexts: Lightweight and automatic remapping mechanisms will also be of use in exploiting metacomputing distributed computing resources. Data assimilation provides a method for improving the quality of the forecast by including the influence of observations in a running simulation. Assimilation schemes include Newtonian nudging <ref> [17] </ref>, optimal interpolation (OI), and four-dimensional variational assimilation. Four-dimensional data assimilation can, however, add significantly to the cost of a simulation; moreover, it requires efficient parallel input and may introduce additional load imbalance. [9].

Load balancing is important to efficient use of parallel machines, but must be lightweight enough to deal effectively with imbalances that arise quickly as the result of model physics, for example, from the onset of unstable convec 7 tion.
