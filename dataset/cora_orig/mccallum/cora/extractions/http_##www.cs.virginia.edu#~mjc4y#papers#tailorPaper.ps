Abstract: Our future efforts will be in continued enhancements to the mapping techniques used in one dimension, and in producing mappings from motion into a two-dimensional analog control signal. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Ron Williams for having the vision to undertake the CANDY project. We are also grateful to Freder-ick Brooks, Jr. of UNC Chapel Hill, whose suggestion of videotaping the trials led to several insights. The decomposition of the two-dimensional problem into its one-dimensional components is an idea borrowed from Marc Raibert [11]. Finally, we would like to thank our subjects and their families, without whose help this research would not have been possible.
