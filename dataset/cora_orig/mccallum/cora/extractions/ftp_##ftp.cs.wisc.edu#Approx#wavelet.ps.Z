Abstract: Technical Summary Report #92-09 February, 1992 Abstract: A new approach for the construction of wavelets and prewavelets on IR d from mul-tiresolution is presented. The method uses only properties of shift-invariant spaces and orthogonal projectors from L 2 (IR d ) onto these spaces, and requires neither decay nor stability of the scaling function. Furthermore, this approach allows a simple derivation of previous, as well as new, constructions of wavelets, and leads to a complete resolution of questions concerning the nature of the intersection and the union of a scale of spaces to be used in a multiresolution.

Reference-contexts: Prewavelets have been stressed only in recent years beginning with Battle <ref> [B] </ref>. The paper of Jia and Micchelli [JM] discusses their brief history. Most methods used for the construction of wavelets are based on the notion of multiresolution as introduced by Mallat [Ma] and Meyer (see [Me]). Multiresolution, which we now describe, will also form the starting point for our constructions. <p> The bracket product also appears naturally in the computation of the norms of elements s 2 S (). By (1.11), bs = t b and (2:10) (2) d=2 ksk L 2 (IR d ) = kbsk L 2 (IR d ) = kt <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> 1=2 k L 2 (TT d ) : 8 There is a simple description for the orthogonal projector P := P from L 2 (IR d ) onto the principal shift-invariant space S (). <p> It was shown in [BDR] that P is described by (2:11) d P f = <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> where we use the convention (throughout this paper) that 0 times any extended number is 0; in particular 0=0 is defined to be 0. (We note that, by the definition of the bracket product, b vanishes whenever [ b ; b ] does.) There is a <p> is described by (2:11) d P f = <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> where we use the convention (throughout this paper) that 0 times any extended number is 0; in particular 0=0 is defined to be 0. (We note that, by the definition of the bracket product, b vanishes whenever [ b ; b ] does.) There is a similar formula (which we shall not need) in the case S is finitely generated (see [BDR1]). There are several interesting points to be made about bracket products and the projector P . <p> There are several interesting points to be made about bracket products and the projector P . First of all, from (2.6), it follows that has orthonormal shifts if and only if <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> = 1 a.e. on TT d . In this case, formula (2.11) is the (Fourier transform of the) usual one for projecting onto S (). In the case that does not have orthonormal shifts, but [ b ; b ] 6= 0 a.e., the function fl <p> it follows that has orthonormal shifts if and only if <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> = 1 a.e. on TT d . In this case, formula (2.11) is the (Fourier transform of the) usual one for projecting onto S (). In the case that does not have orthonormal shifts, but [ b ; b ] 6= 0 a.e., the function fl with Fourier transform (2:12) c fl := [ b ; b ] 1=2 is in S (), has orthonormal shifts, and generates S (), i.e., S ( fl ) = S (). <p> In this case, formula (2.11) is the (Fourier transform of the) usual one for projecting onto S (). In the case that does not have orthonormal shifts, but <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> 6= 0 a.e., the function fl with Fourier transform (2:12) c fl := [ b ; b ] 1=2 is in S (), has orthonormal shifts, and generates S (), i.e., S ( fl ) = S (). Since the square root of the bracket product appears very frequently, we introduce the following notation: (2:13) e := [ b ; b ] 1=2 = <p> Fourier transform (2:12) c fl := <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> 1=2 is in S (), has orthonormal shifts, and generates S (), i.e., S ( fl ) = S (). Since the square root of the bracket product appears very frequently, we introduce the following notation: (2:13) e := [ b ; b ] 1=2 = ( fi22ZZ d with the sum taken, offhand, pointwise, hence defined for any on IR d if we allow it to take the value 1. <p> Moreover, k b k L 2 (IR d ) = k e k L 2 (TT d ) . Turning back to the orthogonal projection, we can write it in the form (2:15) d P f = <ref> [ b f ; b] </ref> b ; b := e 2 and check that e e = 1 on supp e , and therefore, by the above lemma, b 2 L 2 (IR d ) if and only if 1= e 2 L 2 (supp e ). <p> In such a case, by (2.5), <ref> [ b f ; b] </ref> 2 L 1 (TT d ), and we can formally write the orthogonal projection P f in the form (2:16) P f = j2ZZ d 9 with [ b f; b] _ (j) the jth Fourier coefficient of [ b f ; b]. <p> In such a case, by (2.5), [ b f ; b] 2 L 1 (TT d ), and we can formally write the orthogonal projection P f in the form (2:16) P f = j2ZZ d 9 with <ref> [ b f; b] </ref> _ (j) the jth Fourier coefficient of [ b f ; b]. A special case of the above occurs when has L 2 (IR d )-stable shifts, i.e., when forms a stable basis for S (). <p> In such a case, by (2.5), <ref> [ b f ; b] </ref> 2 L 1 (TT d ), and we can formally write the orthogonal projection P f in the form (2:16) P f = j2ZZ d 9 with [ b f; b] _ (j) the jth Fourier coefficient of [ b f ; b]. A special case of the above occurs when has L 2 (IR d )-stable shifts, i.e., when forms a stable basis for S (). <p> This means that the structure of S is determined by the vectors ( b (x + fi)) fi22ZZ d, 2 , x 2 TT d . For example, for any fixed x, these vectors are linearly independent if and only if the associated Gramian matrix (2:21) G () := <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> ; 2 has non-zero determinant at x. <p> Therefore, fg [ W generates S 1 (). It follows that W generates W . From (2.11), we obtain a simple description of the Fourier transform of the cw v : (3:9) cw v := c v d P v = c v <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> Theorem 3.10. <p> Our next result illustrates this procedure and provides a set of generators which are compactly supported functions whenever is, a property the generators in W lack. Theorem 3.12. Assume that S () S 1 (), supp b = supp b = IR d , and that <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> (or equivalently e ) is bounded. Then the 2 d 1 functions W c := ([ b ; b ] b v [ b v ; b ] b ) _ provide a basis for the wavelet space W . <p> Theorem 3.12. Assume that S () S 1 (), supp b = supp b = IR d , and that [ b ; b ] (or equivalently e ) is bounded. Then the 2 d 1 functions W c := ([ b ; b ] b v <ref> [ b v ; b ] </ref> b ) _ provide a basis for the wavelet space W . If has compact support, then the functions in W c are also of compact support. Proof. <p> If has compact support, then the functions in W c are also of compact support. Proof. Since c W c is obtained from c W by multiplying by the 2-periodic scalar matrix <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref>I, which is assumed here to be bounded, we conclude that c W c L 2 (IR d ). Furthermore, supp b = IR d implies, by Theorem 3.10, that W provides a basis. <p> Furthermore, supp b = IR d implies, by Theorem 3.10, that W provides a basis. Hence, by Theorem 2.26, W c provides a basis for W as well. It remains to show that the functions in W c are compactly supported whenever is. By Lemma 2.8, <ref> [ b v ; b ] </ref> is a trigonometric polynomial. Therefore, the inverse transform of [ b v ; b ] b is a finite linear combination of the shifts of , hence is compactly supported since is. <p> Hence, by Theorem 2.26, W c provides a basis for W as well. It remains to show that the functions in W c are compactly supported whenever is. By Lemma 2.8, <ref> [ b v ; b ] </ref> is a trigonometric polynomial. Therefore, the inverse transform of [ b v ; b ] b is a finite linear combination of the shifts of , hence is compactly supported since is. <p> Therefore, the inverse transform of [ b v ; b ] b is a finite linear combination of the shifts of , hence is compactly supported since is. The same argument shows that the inverse transform of <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> b v is also compactly supported, and thus, indeed, the functions in W c are compactly supported. The next theorem shows that W always has a set of generators consisting of orthogonal wavelets. 15 Theorem 3.13. <p> Theorem 3.14. Let S () S 1 () and supp b = supp b = IR d . Then: (i) If w 2 S 1 (), then the functions w (+v), v 2 V 0 , are all in W if and only if <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] is 2-periodic. (ii) If w is a generator for S 1 () and [[ bw; b ]] is 2-periodic, then the functions v2V 0 provide a basis for W . Proof. (i): Since w 2 L 2 (IR d ), the function [[ bw; b ]] is <p> Then: (i) If w 2 S 1 (), then the functions w (+v), v 2 V 0 , are all in W if and only if <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] is 2-periodic. (ii) If w is a generator for S 1 () and [[ bw; b ]] is 2-periodic, then the functions v2V 0 provide a basis for W . Proof. (i): Since w 2 L 2 (IR d ), the function [[ bw; b ]] is in L 1 ([2 : : 2] d ). <p> if and only if <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] is 2-periodic. (ii) If w is a generator for S 1 () and [[ bw; b ]] is 2-periodic, then the functions v2V 0 provide a basis for W . Proof. (i): Since w 2 L 2 (IR d ), the function [[ bw; b ]] is in L 1 ([2 : : 2] d ). Proceeding as in (2.6), Z w (x j)(x) dx = (2) d IR d 1 Z e j [[ bw; b ]]; j 2 ZZ d =2: Now, the functions w ( + v), v 2 V <p> Proof. (i): Since w 2 L 2 (IR d ), the function <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] is in L 1 ([2 : : 2] d ). Proceeding as in (2.6), Z w (x j)(x) dx = (2) d IR d 1 Z e j [[ bw; b ]]; j 2 ZZ d =2: Now, the functions w ( + v), v 2 V 0 , are all in W if and only if the inner products appearing in (3.15) are zero whenever j 2 (ZZ d =2) n ZZ d , i.e., if and only <p> b ]]; j 2 ZZ d =2: Now, the functions w ( + v), v 2 V 0 , are all in W if and only if the inner products appearing in (3.15) are zero whenever j 2 (ZZ d =2) n ZZ d , i.e., if and only if <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] has period 2. (ii): From the facts that the half-shifts of w generate S 1 (), and supp b = IR d , we easily conclude that supp bw = IR d , and therefore, by Corollary 2.34, W fl := v2V provides a basis for S <p> It follows that the Gramian of any subset of W fl , and in particular the subset W fl nfwg, is non-zero a.e. as well, while, by (i), this latter set lies in W , since we also assume that <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] is 2-periodic. Thus, we have found 2 d 1 functions in W (viz., the functions in W fl nfwg) whose Gramian is non-zero a.e., while Theorem 3.10 asserts that W contains a basis of cardinality 2 d 1. <p> We give some examples of functions w which satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3.14. Since any function w 2 W is in S 1 (), we must have bw = t b for some 4-periodic t , and so (3:16) <ref> [[ bw; b ] </ref>] = [[t b; b ]] = t [[b; b ]]: We would like the function in (3.16) to be of period 2. <p> We give some examples of functions w which satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 3.14. Since any function w 2 W is in S 1 (), we must have bw = t b for some 4-periodic t , and so (3:16) [[ bw; b ]] = <ref> [[t b; b ] </ref>] = t [[b; b ]]: We would like the function in (3.16) to be of period 2. <p> Since any function w 2 W is in S 1 (), we must have bw = t b for some 4-periodic t , and so (3:16) [[ bw; b ]] = [[t b; b ]] = t <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>]: We would like the function in (3.16) to be of period 2. One obvious choice is to take t = 1=[[b; b ]] which gives the function w 0 with Fourier transform (3:17) bw 0 := b=[[b; b ]] = b =[[ b ; b ]]: The half-shifts <p> Note the intimate relation between the present w 0 and the "dual function" which was defined in (2.15). Indeed, w 0 is orthogonal to each ( + j), j 2 ZZ d =2nf0g since <ref> [[ bw 0 ; b ] </ref>] = 1. In general, w 0 will not be in L 2 (IR d ) because of the division by [[ b ; b ]] = 2 . <p> Indeed, w 0 is orthogonal to each ( + j), j 2 ZZ d =2nf0g since [[ bw 0 ; b ]] = 1. In general, w 0 will not be in L 2 (IR d ) because of the division by <ref> [[ b ; b ] </ref>] = 2 . However, we can multiply bw 0 by any 2-periodic function and obtain the Fourier transform of other candidates. <p> In particular, in the case = (2) usually studied in wavelet constructions, we shall recover various generators for W given by other authors. Our starting point is the function w of Theorem 3.10, i.e., the function whose Fourier transform is <ref> [e 1=2 b ; b ] </ref> b : We know from Theorem 3.10 that w provides a basis for W . We wish to express the generators that follow in terms of . <p> For this we shall use the refinement relation (1.6): (5:4) b = Ab with A a 4-periodic function. Theorem 5.5. Let (5:6) b := 2e 1=2 A ( + 2) ( + 2) 2 b = 2e 1=2 <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>]( + 2)b: If b 2 L 2 (IR), then its inverse transform is a generator for the wavelet space. Moreover, has orthonormal (respectively, stable) shifts if the shifts of and the half-shifts of are orthonormal (respectively, stable). Proof. <p> We will show that bw= b is 2-periodic. Since (5.2) implies that supp b = IR, this will prove, by (1.11), that w 2 S ( ) and hence generates W . Since e 1=2 (+2) = e 1=2 , and e 1=2 is 4-periodic, we see that <ref> [e 1=2 b ; b ] </ref> = e 1=2 ( while [ b ; b ] = ( + 2) 2 . Substituting this into (5.3), we obtain that bw = e 2 Since b = Ab, and A is 4-periodic, . <p> Since e 1=2 (+2) = e 1=2 , and e 1=2 is 4-periodic, we see that [e 1=2 b ; b ] = e 1=2 ( while <ref> [ b ; b ] </ref> = ( + 2) 2 . Substituting this into (5.3), we obtain that bw = e 2 Since b = Ab, and A is 4-periodic, . <p> The function is then the spline wavelet of Battle and Lemarie (see <ref> [B] </ref>). The prewavelet part of Theorem 5.5 has been proved by Micchelli in [Mi], but under different hypotheses. He does not assume (5.2), but assumes that satisfies the refinement equation (1.6) with coefficients a 2 ` 1 (ZZ). Similar ideas have been employed by Chui and Wang [CW], [CW1]. <p> generator fl for the wavelet space W = S 1 () S () is given by b fl := b; where := t =, and is a 2-periodic trigonometric polynomial of maximal degree that divides t := e 1=2 A ( + 2) ( + 2) 2 = e 1=2 <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>]( + 2): Proof. From Theorem 5.5, we know that := (t b) _ generates W . Thus the claim will follow from the argument preceding this corollary, as soon as we show that t indeed is a trigonometric polynomial. <p> But, as already observed in Theorem 5.5, the construction of prewavelets is based on the function (7:3) B := <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] = A 2 ; and for that reason we assigned it the above special notation, B. The derivations of generators and bases for W that were carried out in x3 involved only the function . <p> As for the second, since W S 1 (), any function in W has Fourier transform of the form (7.5). Since, for any functions f; g 2 L 2 (IR d ), [f; g] = Q 0 ([[f; g]]), we conclude that <ref> [ bw; b ] </ref> = Q 0 ([[t b; b ]]) = Q 0 (t B): Since w 2 W if and only if [ bw; b ] = 0, the main claim of this corollary follows. <p> Since, for any functions f; g 2 L 2 (IR d ), [f; g] = Q 0 ([[f; g]]), we conclude that <ref> [ bw; b ] </ref> = Q 0 ([[t b; b ]]) = Q 0 (t B): Since w 2 W if and only if [ bw; b ] = 0, the main claim of this corollary follows. If t is a polynomial and is compactly supported, then t b certainly is the Fourier transform of a compactly supported function. <p> We begin by generalizing a construction used by Lorentz and Madych [LM] (see also [JM] and [So]). 31 We can decompose the function B = <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] into its 2-periodic components, as in (2.31): (7:7) B = v2V If and are of compact support, then (by the half-shift analog of Lemma 2.8), B = [[b; b ]] is a 4-periodic polynomial. In such a case, the functions B v are 2-periodic polynomials. <p> construction used by Lorentz and Madych [LM] (see also [JM] and [So]). 31 We can decompose the function B = <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] into its 2-periodic components, as in (2.31): (7:7) B = v2V If and are of compact support, then (by the half-shift analog of Lemma 2.8), B = [[b; b ]] is a 4-periodic polynomial. In such a case, the functions B v are 2-periodic polynomials. <p> Note that if e v , v 2 V , is an exponential which is not constant on 4J, then P Theorem 7.11. Assume that and satisfy (7.1) and (7.2), and define, as before, B := <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>]. Let J be any subgroup of the group V , let v be any element of V for which e v is non-constant on 4J, and let K be any union of cosets (in V ) of J which contains 0. <p> Moreover, if and have compact support, then w is also of compact support. Proof. In case and are compactly supported, B = <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] is a trigonometric polynomial, and hence each w v;K (which is then a well-defined L 2 -function) is compactly supported. 33 To prove the main claim of this theorem, it is enough, in view of Corollary 7.4, to show that t := ff24K satisfies X 24V Since t <p> It is then easy to prove that the V 0 -shifts of w provide a basis for the wavelet space. There is a close relation between the function w here and the generator w of W of Corollary 3.19, only that there we used 2 = <ref> [[ b ; b ] </ref>], while here we use the function B = [[b; b ]]. It follows, for example, that if and are compactly supported and the refinement mask A is a polynomial, w here enjoys a smaller support than w of Corollary 3.19. <p> There is a close relation between the function w here and the generator w of W of Corollary 3.19, only that there we used 2 = [[ b ; b ]], while here we use the function B = <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>]. It follows, for example, that if and are compactly supported and the refinement mask A is a polynomial, w here enjoys a smaller support than w of Corollary 3.19. <p> The simplest instance of Theorem 7.11 occurs when J := f0; ffg is a group of order 2. We obtain the following extension of Theorem 5.5 to the multivariate setting. Here, as before, B is defined as <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] = A Corollary 7.12. Assume that and satisfy (7.1) and (7.2). <p> Assume that and satisfy (7.1) and (7.2) and that B := <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] is real-valued. Assume that has L 2 -stable full-shifts and has L 2 -stable half-shifts. <p> On the other hand, there is some hope that turning to the more general elements of W given in Theorem 7.11, an analogue of Theorem 7.13 may be established in higher dimensions. We have assumed in Theorem 7.13 that the function B = <ref> [[b; b ] </ref>] is real. Since also B = A is real if and only if the mask A is real. This is true for example if is real-valued and symmetric about the origin and = (2). Moreover, the assumption that B (or A) is real can be somewhat weakened.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction We present a new approach for the construction of wavelets and prewavelets on IR d from multiresolution. Our method, which is based on our earlier work [BDR] and <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, uses only properties of shift-invariant spaces and orthogonal projectors from L 2 (IR d ) onto these spaces, and requires neither decay nor stability of the scaling function. <p> Discussions of the stability question, including earlier references, can be found in [JM] (also for norms other than the 2-norm) and in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. <p> Assuming supp b = IR d , we have shown in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> that there is always a function fl which generates S (), (i.e. S ( fl ) = S ()), whose shifts are L 2 (IR d )-stable; in fact they can be taken to be orthonormal. <p> We conclude with a brief discussion in x8 of exponential box splines as wavelets, and describe stable bases for their associated wavelet spaces. 2. Shift-invariant spaces Our analysis will be based on the structure of shift-invariant spaces given in our earlier work [BDR] and <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. In this section, we review some of these facts and develop them somewhat further in directions pertinent to the construction of wavelets. We have already mentioned in (1.11) a characterization of S = S () in terms of Fourier transforms. <p> With the aid of (1.11), we obtain the following simple answer <ref> [BDR1] </ref> to this problem: Corollary 2.2. Let S () be a principal shift-invariant space, and let f 2 S (). Then f generates S () if and only if supp b f supp b . Proof. <p> By (1.11), we conclude that 2 S (f ), and hence S (f ) = S (). The above description of principal shift-invariant spaces in terms of their Fourier transforms can be generalized to the finitely generated shift-invariant space S () as follows (cf. Theorem 1.7 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>): (2:3) d S () = f 2 t b 2 L 2 (IR d ) : t is 2-periodic; 2 g: From the description (1.11) of the principal shift-invariant space S (), we see that the Fourier transform of a function s 2 S () is determined by its values <p> any extended number is 0; in particular 0=0 is defined to be 0. (We note that, by the definition of the bracket product, b vanishes whenever [ b ; b ] does.) There is a similar formula (which we shall not need) in the case S is finitely generated (see <ref> [BDR1] </ref>). There are several interesting points to be made about bracket products and the projector P . First of all, from (2.6), it follows that has orthonormal shifts if and only if [ b ; b ] = 1 a.e. on TT d . <p> Namely, the orthogonality of the half-shifts is equivalent to = 2 d=2 a.e., and the stability is equivalent to the boundedness a.e. of We next describe in more detail the structure of the finitely generated space S = S (); a more complete discussion can be found in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. First, for s 2 S, the representation (2.3) for bs is local in the sense that we can independently assign the values t (x) for x 2 TT d and 2 . <p> All bases for S have the same number of elements. We note, <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, that not every finitely generated shift-invariant space S contains a basis. We also note that G () is a non-negative definite matrix, hence is a basis if and only if det G () &gt; 0 a.e. on TT d . <p> Any L 2 -stable basis is obviously a basis. One easily checks that the present definition coincides with the (seemingly weaker) one given in the introduction. We recall from <ref> [BDR1] </ref> that the finite generating set for S is an L 2 -stable basis for S if and only if, for some matrix norm k k (and hence all matrix norms), (2:24) kG ()k; kG () 1 k 2 L 1 (TT d ): In particular, this is the case only <p> The above is easily proved by noticing the effect of the transformation T on the Gramian: (2:27) G ((T b ) _ ) = TG ()T fl ; with T fl the conjugate transpose of T; see <ref> [BDR1; Cor.3.31] </ref> for more details. A special case of the above occurs when T is a diagonal matrix. In this case, provides a new basis if and only if L 2 (IR d ) and the 2-periodic functions ft ; g are different from zero a.e. on TT d . <p> If provides a basis for S := S (), then can be orthonormalized by a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We summarize this fact in the following theorem whose proof is left to the reader (and can be found in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>). Theorem 2.28. <p> In what follows, we denote by diam the length of the smallest interval containing the subset of IR. With the aid of [R2], the following result on linearly independent generators was proved in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. Result 5.10. Let S be a univariate principal shift-invariant space which is generated by a compactly supported function.

Reference-contexts: This motivated the study of prewavelets. We obtain prewavelets by finding generators of W whose shifts form an L 2 (IR)-stable basis for W (but not necessarily an orthonormal system). Chui and Wang <ref> [CW] </ref> and Micchelli [Mi] have shown in the univariate case that if has compact support and L 2 (IR)-stable shifts and (1.3) is satisfied (again with S k := S k ()) then there is a compactly supported prewavelet which generates W . <p> The prewavelet part of Theorem 5.5 has been proved by Micchelli in [Mi], but under different hypotheses. He does not assume (5.2), but assumes that satisfies the refinement equation (1.6) with coefficients a 2 ` 1 (ZZ). Similar ideas have been employed by Chui and Wang <ref> [CW] </ref>, [CW1]. In particular, when is the cardinal B-spline, the prewavelet of Theorem 5.5 is their compactly supported spline wavelet (except for an integer shift). 24 The remainder of this section will be devoted to the important case when the functions and are compactly supported. <p> Result 5.10 tells us that the search for a linearly independent generator is, necessarily, the same as the search for a minimally supported generator in the sense that we are minimizing diam supp w among all generators w. Chui and Wang, <ref> [CW] </ref>, considered a slightly different notion of minimality: they were interested in finding a generator w for W which can be expressed in the form bw = t b, with t a trigonometric polynomial of minimal degree (they assume that the refinement mask A = b =b 26 is a polynomial, <p> In any event, with straightforward modifications, the arguments used in Proposition 5.13 and Corollary 5.14 can be applied to show that the same characterization holds for the "minimal w" in the <ref> [CW] </ref> sense. Chui and Wang stated their results in terms of the symmetric zeros of the trigonometric polynomials involved. Let us pause for a moment to see how symmetric zeros enter into the characterizations provided above.

Reference-contexts: A particularly interesting application of wavelet constructions is to functions which are B-splines or box splines. In this regard, we obtain the compactly supported univariate spline prewavelets of Chui and Wang <ref> [CW1] </ref> and derive various orthogonal wavelets and prewavelets obtained from box splines. As we have already noted, our construction of wavelets and prewavelets is based on our earlier results on the structure of shift-invariant spaces. We use two facts repeatedly. <p> The prewavelet part of Theorem 5.5 has been proved by Micchelli in [Mi], but under different hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: Prewavelets have been stressed only in recent years beginning with Battle [B]. The paper of Jia and Micchelli <ref> [JM] </ref> discusses their brief history. Most methods used for the construction of wavelets are based on the notion of multiresolution as introduced by Mallat [Ma] and Meyer (see [Me]). Multiresolution, which we now describe, will also form the starting point for our constructions. <p> Discussions of the stability question, including earlier references, can be found in <ref> [JM] </ref> (also for norms other than the 2-norm) and in [BDR1]. <p> We shall give a simple derivation of (a slightly stronger version of) these facts in x5. In the multivariate case, the construction of orthogonal wavelet and prewavelet sets is by far more involved. Micchelli [Mi] and Jia and Micchelli <ref> [JM] </ref> have studied multiresolution in the case the function has L 2 (IR d )-stable shifts and satisfies two regularity conditions. <p> We even provide a characterization of property (1.3)(ii) for the case when (1.9) fails to hold. We also show that (1.3)(ii) and (iii) automatically hold whenever is of compact support. Details can be found in x4. Previous results on the matter (cf. e.g., <ref> [JM] </ref> and [So]) were derived under the stability assumption and under suitable decay conditions. The main goal of multiresolution is to construct a set of of 2 d 1 functions which generate the wavelet space W (i.e., W = S ()) and have other prescribed properties. <p> Furthermore, in this case the right inequality of (2.25) trivially holds, and thus, due to the continuity of det G (), stability is equivalent to the condition det G ()(x) &gt; 0; 8x 2 TT d : This latter characterization of stability was obtained by Jia and Micchelli <ref> [JM] </ref> under slightly stronger assumptions (which imply the continuity assumption). With the notions of basis and L 2 -stable basis in hand, the following theorem shows how from one which provides a (stable) basis for S we can obtain other sets with the same property. <p> For example, in the univariate case and under certain restrictions on the smoothness and decay of , Mallat [Ma] showed that whenever has orthonormal shifts, assumption (1.3)(i) implies that [S k = L 2 (IR d ). Recently, this was generalized to the multivariate case by Jia and Micchelli <ref> [JM] </ref> who replaced orthonormality by L 2 (IR d )-stability and replaced Mallat's other conditions by the requirements that ffi 2 L 2 (TT d ), and that satisfy the refinement equation (1.6) for a sequence a from ` 1 (ZZ d ). <p> We remark that linear independence of the shifts of implies that these shifts are L 2 (IR)-stable, (cf. <ref> [JM] </ref>). In what follows, we denote by diam the length of the smallest interval containing the subset of IR. With the aid of [R2], the following result on linearly independent generators was proved in [BDR1]. Result 5.10. <p> We begin by generalizing a construction used by Lorentz and Madych [LM] (see also <ref> [JM] </ref> and [So]). 31 We can decompose the function B = [[b; b ]] into its 2-periodic components, as in (2.31): (7:7) B = v2V If and are of compact support, then (by the half-shift analog of Lemma 2.8), B = [[b; b ]] is a 4-periodic polynomial. <p> Moreover, if and are of compact support, then w is also of compact support. In some instances, it is possible to find an L 2 -stable basis from among the functions of Corollary 7.12, as is shown in the following theorem of Riemenschneider and Shen [RS] (see also <ref> [JM] </ref>, [RS1] and [CSW]): Theorem 7.13. Assume that and satisfy (7.1) and (7.2) and that B := [[b; b ]] is real-valued. Assume that has L 2 -stable full-shifts and has L 2 -stable half-shifts.

We shall discuss this question in x7 where we shall use our characterizations of the wavelet space W to recover and slightly improve some of these constructions. <p> We begin by generalizing a construction used by Lorentz and Madych [LM] (see also [JM] and <ref> [So] </ref>). 31 We can decompose the function B = [[b; b ]] into its 2-periodic components, as in (2.31): (7:7) B = v2V If and are of compact support, then (by the half-shift analog of Lemma 2.8), B = [[b; b ]] is a 4-periodic polynomial.
