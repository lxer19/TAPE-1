Title: order sentences. Further,  
Author: B j let r(j) (r (j); r fi (j)) B j and define j ffl:r (j)&lt;sg [LDT (T R d r (j)) :LDT (T R d r (j) )] M['] m 
Note: j=1  j=1 j are themselves first  In particular, f (c) always exists and is always an infinitely differentiable function of c. References 19  
Abstract: Now we determine the sets M[ ]. When has quantifier rank s and r; r 0 differ only on coordinates on which both are at least s then we claim r 2 M[ ] if and only if r 0 2 M[ ]. This is because when both minimal countable models M r and M r 0 have s or more components of the same type Duplicator can play isomorphically on them throughout an s-move Ehrenfeucht game. By an s-box on I let us mean the set of r 2 I where for each coordinate r fl we require either that that coordinate have a specific value, with that value less than s, or we require that the coordinate be at least s. Then M[ ] is the disjoint union of a finite number of s-boxes. But conversely, given ^ ffl:r fl (j)sg LDT (T R fl ; d fl ; s) ; j = 1; : : : ; m: (When r fl (j) = 0 then the expression in the brackets above should be replaced by :LDT (T R fl ; d fl ):) Then ' j and, thus, ' := _ m j=1 B j ; i.e. any disjoint union of s-boxes is M['] for some first order sentence ': (We note that ' may have higher quantifier depth than s.) By Remark 9 this completes the complete characterization of the limit probabilities. Let f (c) denote the limit probability of as a function of the real number c. The form of f (c) is simple to describe if we relax the condition of a complete characterization. The basic sentence LDT (T R fl ; d fl ; i)^:LDT (T R fl ; d fl ; i+1) has a limiting probability f of the form qe e c e ci where ; q are positive rational numbers. The sentence LDT (T R fl ; d fl ; s) will have an f of the form one minus a finite sum of such terms. To conclude this section, we summarize the results in the following theorem. Theorem 22 Let k; l be integers such that l k 1 0: Let be any sentence of the first order language of graphs. Then, in general, the limiting probability f (c) has the form of a finite sum and difference of rational numbers times finite products of terms of the form above, i.e. a linear combination with rational coefficients of terms of the form e c 1 e 2 e c where the 1 ; 2 are themselves rational numbers.
