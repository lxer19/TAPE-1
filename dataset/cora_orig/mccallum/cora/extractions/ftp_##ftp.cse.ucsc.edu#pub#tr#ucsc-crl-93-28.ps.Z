Abstract: A novel method for analyzing interconnect networks with nonlinear terminations is presented. The circuit is partitioned into linear and nonlinear networks. A scattering parameter based macromodel is introduced to model the linear network. An efficient network reduction algorithm is developed to reduce the linear network into a network containing one multiport component (macromodel) together with sources and loads of interest. Exponentially Decayed Polynomial Functions(EDPF) are used to approximate the scattering parameters of the macromodel, which is always stable for stable circuits. In order to incorporate the macromodel into a SPICE like circuit simulator, a simplified recursive convolution formula is developed and Norton equivalent circuits are derived based on recursive convolution. Experiment results indicate that our method can approach the accuracy of SPICE3e2 with order of magnitudes less computing time.

Reference-contexts: We have presented a scattering parameter based macromodel [7, 8] to compute transfer functions of interconnect systems. Scattering parameter (s-parameter) based methods provides efficient techniques to analyze practical analog and digital integrated circuit interconnect systems that can contain large number of coupled conductors and discontinuities <ref> [1, 9, 10] </ref>. S-parameters are well suited for the characterizing and modeling of linear high frequency devices, partially because it is easier to directly measure the scattering parameters of any components on broad frequency bands [13].
