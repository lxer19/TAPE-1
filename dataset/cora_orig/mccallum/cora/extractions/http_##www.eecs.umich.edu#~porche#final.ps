Abstract: A real time, highly decentralized, adaptive traffic signal optimization method, ALLONS-D, based on the Rolling Horizon Dynamic Programming technique, is presented in this paper. We describe the basic architecture, the system model, and the optimization scheme of ALLONS-D. We compare ALLONS-D with other approaches to signal control via several sets of simulation results. The margins of improvement are significant when compared with the standard Webster's criteria for signal setting. The feasibility of on-line implementation of ALLONS-D is discussed as well as on-going evaluations and extensions.

Reference-contexts: An adaptive traffic control system that is decentralized has each intersection determine its signal plan locally. Both decentralized and centralized schemes exist in the field. Most of the early traffic-responsive schemes were based on selecting on-line predefined plans from a set of plans generated off-line <ref> [1] </ref>. Implementation of these methods involved choosing the most suitable predefined plan and adapting this plan to current traffic conditions. These adaptations involved, for example, extending the green time given to a particular phase or skipping a phase based on current demand. <p> SCATS (The Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System) optimizes cycle length, phase split, and offset so as to maintain the highest degree of saturation in the traffic network. We refer the reader to <ref> [1] </ref> for an overview of these schemes. In this paper we present ALLONS-D, a real-time traffic responsive strategy for decentralized control of traffic signals. ALLONS-D (Adaptive Limited Lookahead Optimization of Network Signals Decentralized Version) is a decentralized method based on Rolling Horizon Dynamic Programming (RHDP).

Reference-contexts: Other schemes simply implemented off-line strategies for signal control at increased frequencies. Overall, these adaptive schemes gave very marginal improvements in performance, if any, and often resulted in poorer performance than fixed-cycle plans <ref> [2] </ref>. More recent adaptive schemes, such as SCOOT [3] and SCATS [4], however, do not rely on pre-defined plans and are based on on-line optimization schemes. <p> ALLONS-D can consider additional priority for vehicles of different types and/or occupancy levels in the traffic stream. RHDP , as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers, and schemes such as OPAC <ref> [2, 6] </ref>, PRODYN [7], and UTOPIA [8] have been developed and tested. ALLONS-D has several features distinguishing it from these methods. We discuss this in more detail later in this paper. This document is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: The SCOOT (Split, Cycle and Offset Optimizer) system attempts an incremental op-timization of cycle time, phase split, and offset, and it is based on a platoon dispersion and queue profile traffic model similar to that of the off-line scheme TRANSYT <ref> [5] </ref>. SCATS (The Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System) optimizes cycle length, phase split, and offset so as to maintain the highest degree of saturation in the traffic network. We refer the reader to [1] for an overview of these schemes.

Reference-contexts: The queue lengths and arrival information required by the optimizer could be made available in one of several ways: by upstream detectors located on all approaches to the intersection, by a combination of upstream and downstream detectors, or via surveillance cameras like AUTOSCOPE <ref> [9] </ref>. The intersection controller requires knowledge of the exact time at which the vehicle arrives at the end of the link and the queue it joins on reaching the intersection.

Reference-contexts: ALLONS-D: The Optimization Algorithm 3.1. The STLC Backtracking Procedure In this section we discuss the search strategy adopted in ALLONS-D to compare different policies and obtain an optimal path in the decision tree. The search is a variation of backtracking <ref> [10] </ref> which is a depth-first search procedure. A tree is searched by continuously exploring nodes at increasing depths until an end node is reached.

Reference-contexts: Thus the tree is effectively pruned. The process continues until no unexplored nodes are encountered as the algorithm backs into the starting node. As in OPAC, SPPORT <ref> [11] </ref>, and other strategies, signal plans found by ALLONS-D are implemented using the rolling horizon concept.

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitations, only a subset of the simulation results that have been obtained are presented here; readers interested in further simulation results should contact the authors. Simulations were performed using the commercially available simulation program INTEGRATION c fl Ver. 1.5e <ref> [12] </ref>, as well as a special simulation program called STNS [13]. STNS was developed at the University of Michi-gan to function similarly to INTEGRATION. Unlike INTEGRATION and another well know simulation program, TRAF-NETSIM, STNS is capable of implementing RHDP traffic control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: By comparing these two columns, it is evident that both simulators compute this MOE in a consistent fashion within a small error. The signal plans in the INTEGRATION program are optimized based on the method of Webster and Cobbe <ref> [14] </ref>. Column 4 represents the travel time in STNS for a different signal plan computed using the ALLONS-D algorithm. At the beginning of each simulation, we assume that there are no vehicles in the simulated network. Further, we do not make any assumptions on the arrival process.

Reference-contexts: SCATS or SCOOT are not possible as they are proprietary, commercial products. (However, SCATS relies heavily on the adaptive Webster implementation enabled in the INTEGRATION software in addition to heuristics for coordination.) The incorporation of bus priority is allowed by ALLONS-D and simulation tests have been reported for these cases <ref> [15] </ref>. We are currently working on comparing ALLONS-D with the traffic actuated policy incorporated in the TRAF-NETSIM software.
