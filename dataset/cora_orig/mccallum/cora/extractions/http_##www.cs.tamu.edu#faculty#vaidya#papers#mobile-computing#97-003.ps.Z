Reference-contexts: Recent annual growth rates in wireless applications have been between 35 and 60 percent per year, and it is anticipated that over 100 million users will have some version of wireless personal communications system (PCS) by the end of the century <ref> [1] </ref>. As this trend towards wireless systems continues, it becomes more and more important to insure that the transport layer protocols being used are tuned to perform well both in the traditional wired networks and in heterogeneous networks.

Reference-contexts: Reliable transport layer protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) which are in use today have been specifically tuned to work well in traditional wired networks. In this environment, error rates are well below one percent and packet losses may be attributed almost entirely to network congestion <ref> [2] </ref>. The proper response for a TCP sender when packets are lost in this situation is to decrease throughput in order to prevent a congestive collapse in which useful network throughput grinds to a halt. Unlike traditional networks, wireless systems may have intermittent periods of high error rates [3]. <p> This was the first TCP implementation to include the congestion control mechanisms and round-trip-timing enhancements proposed by Van Jacobson in his paper Congestion Avoidance and Control <ref> [2] </ref>. These new algorithms were introduced in response to congestive collapses which began occurring on the Internet in 1986 and caused throughput to drop in some cases by a factor of a thousand.

Reference-contexts: The proper response for a TCP sender when packets are lost in this situation is to decrease throughput in order to prevent a congestive collapse in which useful network throughput grinds to a halt. Unlike traditional networks, wireless systems may have intermittent periods of high error rates <ref> [3] </ref>. Heterogeneous networks therefore have a mixture of congestive losses and wireless losses due to errors. Existing TCP implementations are unable to distinguish between these two types of losses, so they use a conservative approach and assume that all losses are due to congestion. <p> This causes the sender to retransmit the packet without taking congestion avoidance measures. Also, if the ELN option is set, the sender may retransmit the lost packet immediately rather than waiting for two more duplicate ACKs. Results for an ideal ELN scheme are given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The Mobile Computing Group at Texas A&M is considering one approach which may be realistically used to implement a form of ELN. Packets lost due to congestion will never make it to the receiver. <p> Finally, reliable link-layer scheme can be optimized for each type of wireless connection. Disadvantages of Link-Layer Protocols Reliable link-layer protocols perform local retransmissions between the base station and the mobile host. It has been shown in <ref> [3] </ref> and [4] that these retransmissions at the link-layer can interfere with TCPs retransmission mechanisms when error rates become significant. This interference is due to competition between the retransmission timers at the two different layers, and inadvertent invocation of Fast-Retransmit by link-layer schemes which allow out-of-order frame delivery. <p> This could become a problem if many connections are serviced by a base station. 2.6 TCP-Aware Link-Layer Improvement Methods The snoop protocol developed by Berkeley is an example of a TCP-Aware link-layer protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. It is a hybrid solution which uses concepts from the link-layer schemes and the split connection approaches. Unlike the other solutions discussed, the basic snoop protocol is specifically designed for data transfers from the fixed host to the mobile host. <p> The transfer time was used to compute the average throughput for each run. Goodput is defined as the ratio of the actual transfer size verses the total number of bytes transmitted over the path <ref> [3] </ref>. A transfer in which there are no losses has a goodput of 100 percent and a transfer with losses has a goodput below 100 percent.

Reference-contexts: Previous research efforts at Texas A&M focused on the proposal and simulation of an Explicit Bad State Notification (EBSN) protocol <ref> [5] </ref>. The EBSN protocol was designed to send a notification from the base station to the receiver when the base station was experiencing high error rates (deep fades).

Reference-contexts: Also, since the Berkeley snoop protocol offers a significant performance improvement over existing TCP implementations on heterogeneous networks, it served as a good baseline for comparison when testing future enhancements. After the snoop protocol was functioning properly, a partial acknowledgment protocol <ref> [6] </ref> proposed by Dr. Vaidya and those of us working with him was implemented. This protocol, which is covered in the third section of the paper, is intended to be used at base stations that are already running snoop. <p> The authors indicate in [11] that the TCP Vegas congestion control mechanisms are very sensitive to round-trip-times and require a significant amount of tuning. 3.0 The Partial Acknowledgment Protocol The partial acknowledgment (ACKP) protocol is a new protocol that was proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> by the Mobile Computing Group at Texas A&M and implemented and tested as part of this project. Previous research efforts at Texas A&M focused on the proposal and simulation of an Explicit Bad State Notification (EBSN) protocol [5].

Reference-contexts: Also, in the case of multiple losses within a single window, it is possible that the sender will retransmit packets which have already been received <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2.2 TCP Reno TCP Reno refers to a version of TCP introduced in the BSD operating system in 1990. It has all of the features of TCP Tahoe plus a new algorithm called Fast-Recovery which builds on the Fast-Retransmit mechanism. <p> The additional information provided by SACK allows the sender to retransmit multiple lost packets within a single round-trip-time. New-Reno has to wait for the ACK of the first retransmitted packet to determine which (if any) other packets have been lost <ref> [7] </ref>. Disadvantages of SACK SACK still makes no attempt to distinguish between losses due to congestion and errors on the wireless link (it just decreases the effects losses have on performance).

Reference-contexts: A further advantage is that they provide the same performance improvements regardless of whether the sender is the mobile host or the fixed host. 2.3.1 TCP New-Reno TCP New-Reno is an experimental version of TCP Reno proposed by Hoe <ref> [8] </ref> which makes a slight modification to the Fast-Recovery algorithm of TCP Reno. Unlike the Reno Fast-Recovery phase which ends when the resent packet is acknowledged, the New-Reno Fast-Recovery phase ends when all of the data is acknowledged which was outstanding at the time the loss was detected.

Reference-contexts: The main idea with any of the proposed SACK schemes is to provide the sender with more detailed information about the state of the receiver than is possible with cumulative ACKs. In 1996, Mathis, Mahdavi, Floyd, and Romanow proposed the MMFR SACK standard for use in the Internet <ref> [9] </ref>. This proposal allows a TCP receiver to send SACK information as a set of options within the TCP header which is complimentary to the existing TCP ACK. The new option fields indicate the starting and ending sequence of noncontiguous sets of data existing at the receiver.

Reference-contexts: It must also move this responsibility to a new base station in a manner that is transparent to both ends when a handoff occurs. The most well known of the split connection approaches is indirect TCP (I-TCP) developed at Rutgers <ref> [10] </ref> [12]. It uses TCP for both connections. Advantages of Split Connections Because split connection protocols completely separate wireless and congestive losses, they are able to obtain very good throughput. 14 Disadvantages of Split Connections Split connection approaches require hard state maintenance at the base station.

Reference-contexts: this could lead to unnecessary timer expirations which invoke congestion avoidance procedures. 2.7 SCPS-TP Improvement Methods The Space Communications Protocol Standards - Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP) is a set of extensions to TCP developed for use in satellite networks by The MITRE Corporation, Gemini Industries, NASA, and the Department of Defense <ref> [11] </ref>. Although some of the concepts introduced with this set of standards are satellite specific, there are number that can be used to improve the performance of TCP on any wireless link that experiences errors. <p> It does this by increasing its congestion window more slowly than standard TCP and by measuring the achieved throughput gain after each increase to detect the available capacity without incurring loss. <ref> [11] </ref> 16 Advantages of SCPS-TP SCPS-TP achieves a very significant performance improvement over standard TCP when errors are present in a high delay-bandwidth wireless environment. SCPS-TP combines the benefits of a number of different techniques. First, it is able to distinguish between congestion and wireless losses. <p> SCPS-TP is also an ideal candidate for the wireless protocol used in a split connection. Disadvantages of SCPS-TP The changes made as part of SCPS-TP are quite significant and so most fixed hosts will probably not be equipped to take advantage of these upgrades. The authors indicate in <ref> [11] </ref> that the TCP Vegas congestion control mechanisms are very sensitive to round-trip-times and require a significant amount of tuning. 3.0 The Partial Acknowledgment Protocol The partial acknowledgment (ACKP) protocol is a new protocol that was proposed in [6] by the Mobile Computing Group at Texas A&M and implemented and tested
