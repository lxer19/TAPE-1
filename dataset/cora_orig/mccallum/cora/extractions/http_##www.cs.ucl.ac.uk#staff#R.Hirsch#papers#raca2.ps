Title: Relation Algebras from Cylindric Algebras, II Version 6.3  
Author: Robin Hirsch and Ian Hodkinson 
Date: January 8, 1999  
Abstract: We prove, for each 4 n &lt; !, that SRaCA n+1 cannot be defined, using only finitely many first-order axioms, relative to SRaCA n . The construction also shows that for 3 m &lt; n &lt; !, SNr m CA n+1 is not finitely axiomatisable over SNr m CA n . In consequence, for a certain standard n-variable first-order proof system ` m;n of m-variable formulas, there is no finite set of m-variable schemata whose m-variable instances, when added to ` m;n as axioms, yield ` m;n+1 .

Reference-contexts: In symbols, we have CA m = SNr m CA m SNr m CA m+1 RCA m , and 3mn&lt;! SNr m CA n = RCA m . Analogous questions to those for SRaCA n now arise about whether these inclusions are proper and non-finitely axiomatisable. In <ref> [And90] </ref>, Andreka proves that for finite m 3, SNr m CA n 6= SNr m CA n+1 if m n &lt; 2n. <p> See theorem 27. (Interestingly, the inequality m &lt; n is indispensible here: Andreka shows that SNr m CA m+1 is finitely axiomatisable <ref> [And90] </ref>. We use the restriction m &lt; n only once in our proof.) Our proof is again by games. The game mentioned above is designed to test a rather stronger property than the simple existence of a hyper-basis: this is helpful in obtaining the non-finite axiomatisability result about neat reducts. <p> That is, A j= b = 1 for every 2 0 . By (18), A j= b' = 1. Since we chose s for A 6j= s = 1, this is a contradiction. 2 Problem 2 As we said in the introduction, <ref> [And90] </ref> showed that SNr n CA n+1 is a finitely axiomatisable class. Does theorem 29 hold when m = n?

Reference-contexts: The class of relation algebras that arise in this way is denoted SRaCA n . At first sight, the definition of SRaCA n is more abstract than for RA n , but in <ref> [HH98a] </ref> it was proved that it can be equivalently defined in the same way, using `n-dimensional hyper-bases'. Hyper-bases generalise cylindric bases by using `hyper-networks' instead of networks. <p> In <ref> [HH98a] </ref>, we proved the analogue of (i,ii) for SRaCA n , and developed the above-mentioned `hyper-basis' characterisation. <p> As we said, this paper continues the work of <ref> [HH98b, HHM98, HH98a] </ref>, but we intend that it can be read independently of them. We will borrow the hyper-basis characterisation of SRaCA n from the earlier papers, and we will assume familiarity with relation algebras and such, but otherwise the paper is self-contained. <p> Outline of paper In section 2, we recall various definitions: for example, of the m-dimensional neat reduct Nr m C and the relation algebra reduct Ra C of a cylindric algebra C, and of a hyper-network and hyper-basis. We quote a result from <ref> [HH98a] </ref>: a relation algebra A belongs to SRaCA n if and only if it embeds in some relation algebra (which can be taken to be its canonical embedding algebra A + ) that has an n-dimensional hyper-basis. We prove results relating hyper-bases to neat reducts. <p> Labels of hyper-edges may be called hyper-labels. So we are thinking of an n-dimensional hyper-network as a labelled hyper-graph with set of nodes n. The following lemma is a straight-forward exercise and was proved in <ref> [HH98a, lemma 13] </ref>. Lemma 3 Let N be an n-dimensional hyper-network and let x; y &lt; n. Then N (x; y) = N (y; x) ^ . 2.3 Hyperbases Definition 4 Let M; N be n-dimensional hyper-networks. <p> We say that A has an n-dimensional hyper-basis if there exists an n-dimensional fl-hyper basis for A, for some set fl as above. We now quote part of the main results of <ref> [HH98a, theorems 1, 39] </ref>. Theorem 6 Let A be any relation algebra, and n 4. The following are equivalent: 1. A 2 SRaCA n 2. A embeds in some atomic relation algebra B that has an n-dimensional hyper-basis. 3. <p> It is easily seen <ref> [HH98a, lemma 36] </ref> that M = N [i=j]. So N [i=j] 2 H. 2 8 We can now prove: Lemma 12 Let fl be a non-empty set. If H is any n-dimensional fl-hyper-basis over A then Hj m is an m-dimensional fl-hyper-basis over A. <p> Similarly, B 0 RaCa (H) via the embedding b 7! fN 2 Ca (H) : N (0; 1) bg, so B 0 2 SRaCA n+1 . Again, since this class is a variety <ref> [HH98a, proposition 51] </ref> and B 0 j B we see that B 2 SRaCA n+1 . Now (13) is proved, and with it, the theorem. 2 6 Proof theory We can easily apply theorem 27 to proof theory with finitely many variables.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and summary Relation algebras were defined by Jonsson and Tarski in 1948 <ref> [JT48] </ref>. One can see them as an attempt to extend the successful algebraisation of unary relations, by boolean algebras, to binary relations, a project that can be traced back at least to De Morgan in the last century.

Reference-contexts: It quickly transpired, however, that these equations were not sufficient to characterise the `representable' algebras isomorphic to genuine fields of binary relations. Lyndon exhibited the first non-representable relation algebra in <ref> [Lyn50] </ref>, and gave a `point-by-point' approach to building representations of relation algebras. Later examples of his led to Monk's famous proof [Mon64] that the class RRA of representable relation algebras is not finitely axiomatisable in first-order logic.

Reference-contexts: The size of fragment needed to detect them can be arbitrarily large, and Monk used this to prove that no one first-order sentence can control them | whence the non-finite axiomatisability. Monk extended his result to cylindric algebras, the higher-arity analogue of relation algebras, in <ref> [Mon69] </ref>. fl Research of the first author partially supported by UK EPSRC grant GR/L85961; research of the second author partially supported by UK EPSRC grants GR/K54946 and GR/L85978. Thanks to Roger Maddux, Maarten Marx, Szabolcs Mikulas, and Mark Reynolds for helpful comments. 1 Monk's arguments were very influential. <p> Much the same story can be told for cylindric algebras. Monk showed in 1969 that for finite m 3, the class RCA m of representable m-dimensional cylindric algebras is not finitely axiomatisable <ref> [Mon69] </ref>. But by insisting that an m-dimensional cylindric algebra is a subalgebra of the `neat reduct' of an n-dimensional cylindric algebra, for larger and larger finite n, we can control its `contradictions' and approach RCA m .

Reference-contexts: Now (13) is proved, and with it, the theorem. 2 6 Proof theory We can easily apply theorem 27 to proof theory with finitely many variables. Because this area is well-known (see, for example, <ref> [Mad83, Mad89, HMT85, TG87, ANS00] </ref>), we do not go into great detail. In [ANS00, section 7], a Hilbert system for proving m-variable formulas with n-variable proofs (for m n &lt; !) is given. All formulas are in a fixed countably infinite signature R consisting of m-ary relation symbols.

Reference-contexts: If H is any n-dimensional hyper-basis for A, and N 2 H, then N o 2 H. PROOF: Since o is not injective, it is either a substitution [i=j] or a product of substitutions (see, e.g., <ref> [Tho93, corollary 1.2] </ref>). Hence it suffices to prove the lemma in the case o = [i=j] for arbitrary i; j &lt; n, which we may assume are distinct.
