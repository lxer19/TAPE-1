Abstract: CS Technical Report 92-52 August 1992 Abstract A key issue in the development of next-generation intelligent systems is the ability to perceive and understand the complex environments in which they will operate. Complex environments are characterized by variable signal-to-noise ratios, unpredictable source behavior, and the simultaneous occurrence of target sources whose signal signatures can overlap, mask, or otherwise distort each other. This paper argues that traditional perceptual architectures have limited effectiveness in such environments and presents an alternative design that is a significant extension of the Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals (IPUS) architecture fl . The IPUS philosophy emphasizes structured bidirectional interaction between numeric signal processing and symbolic interpretation processes. The interaction occurs as a result of search for signal processing control parameter values that produce evidence satisfying the interpretation processes' goals. This search is constrained by formal signal processing theory and dynamically generated problem-solving assumptions. y This paper is based upon work supported by the Rome Air Development Center of the Air Force Systems Command under contract F30602-91-C-0038.

Reference-contexts: This implies that discrepancy detection mechanisms must be able to work with ranges as well as specific values. This requires a representation in which qualitative calculus can be performed. The range calculus used in the sound understanding testbed is similar to Allen's <ref> [1] </ref> common-sense temporal theory. 18 3.2.2 Discrepancy Diagnosis KS The discrepancy diagnosis KS "explains" discrepancies between expected signal behavior and observed signal behavior. It models experts' use of SPA Fourier theory in diagnostic reasoning with a means-ends analysis framework incorporating multiple abstraction levels and a verification phase [29].

Reference-contexts: A `C' has been identified at time t 1 and a `B' is expected at time t 0 since there is an environmental constraint that `B's follow `C's. No behavior supporting the expectation is observed, so diagnostic reasoning should be attempted to explain why). Bell and Pau <ref> [2, 3] </ref> have formalized the search for processing parameter values in numeric-level image understanding algorithms in terms of the Prolog language's unification and backtracking mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: For example, suppose that the signal data is being processed with a zero-crossing analyzer and an STFT. If the zero-crossing analyzer were to indicate the presence of a sinusoidal signal but the STFT does not, a fault would be declared. For another example see Bitar et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, which describes an algorithm for comparing Wigner Distribution and STFT spectra to detect faults. 3. the application domain's a priori signal constraints. Such discrepancies are termed violations.

For a detailed description of acoustic streaming processes, see <ref> [5] </ref>. At the seventh level, sequences of stream hypotheses are interpreted as sound-source hypotheses. Sources are represented in the source database by an acoustic grammar specifying microstream and noisebed frequency ranges and permissible ranges of energy relationships among microstreams and noisebeds within source streams. <p> These algorithms will be implementations of psychoperceptual theories such as streaming in acoustic signals and illusory contouring in visual signals <ref> [5] </ref>. Work must be done in this area to create algorithms which have a unified formal theory similar in structure to that of traditional signal processing algorithms. <p> A demonstration of the architecture's applicability and generality. 4.

A viable platform for future experimentation on psychoacoustic streaming theories <ref> [5] </ref> and control strategies for acoustic signal interpretation. Given these goals, there are two perspectives from which this research program's results should be evaluated. <p> In the course of formalizing the architecture, several sets of control plans and focusing heuristics will be developed to test different control strategies, some of which will be based on experimental psychoacoustic observations <ref> [5] </ref>. This control knowledge can be evaluated quantitatively in the second experiment set in terms of how often the strategy employs reprocessing over a wide range of scenarios versus source identification certainties in the presence of increasing interference between sources in a scenario.

Reference-contexts: Classic adaptive control should therefore be viewed as a special case of an IPUS architecture, where the interpretation models are described solely in terms of probabilistic measures and low-level descriptions of signal parameters. IPUS uses Carver's RESUN <ref> [6] </ref> framework to control knowledge source (KS) execution. This framework views interpretation as a process of gathering evidence to resolve particular hypotheses' sources of uncertainty (SOU) in the interpretation hypotheses. It incorporates a symbolic language for representing SOUs. <p> Therefore, control in IPUS requires a formalism for representing factors that affect their interpretations' confidence levels. The control mechanism must also be able to focus on particular uncertainties in a context-sensitive manner. For these reasons, IPUS uses the RESUN <ref> [6] </ref> framework to control knowledge 4 This three-step process is similar to the one developed in [19] for meta-level control in problem solving systems. 14 source (KS) execution. This framework views interpretation as a process of gath-ering evidence to resolve particular hypotheses' sources of uncertainty (SOUs) in the interpretation hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: As Carver <ref> [7] </ref> points out, most interpretation systems (of which perceptual systems are a subset) have limited means for resolving interpretation uncertainty because they are unable to generate an explicit record of the reasons for the uncertainty. <p> The presence of environmental and problem-solving assumptions as first-class objects available to all system components is an important addition to signal interpretation systems. It provides the basis for more sophisticated diagnostic strategies in determining why a signal expectation was violated (e.g., reasons for interpretation uncertainty <ref> [7] </ref>) and whether or not to reprocess data to find new corroborating data for the explanation. <p> This processing-context history would augment the IPUS SOU framework as a source of information describing why interpretations are uncertain and thus would provide a formal basis for generating reprocessing strategies to resolve discrepancy-related interpretation uncertainties <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An SPA will be termed appropriate for a set S of signals if it produces output that meets all recognition requirements (e.g. all components adequately detected, all components resolved, etc) for each source-combination in 2 S . Systems (e.g., <ref> [9, 23, 30, 37] </ref>) that partially support 1 the ability to recognize that signal data might have been processed by inappropriate front-end SPAs may incorporate this recognition in the uncertainty associated with their output's interpretations, but they tend to have limited formal strategies to resolve this source of uncertainty. <p> The framework does not appear adequate for the general class of signals IPUS is to encounter: signals containing complex structures that must be modeled over time in the presence of variable noise levels. Dawant's framework <ref> [9] </ref> is more general and separates signal interpretation knowledge from signal processing knowledge. It also supports the concept of multiple SPA views (called channels in his terminology).

Reference-contexts: They are similar to that encountered in truth maintenance systems <ref> [10] </ref> when facts assumed in one possible world are disproven or assumed false in another possible world.

Reference-contexts: If two contexts are recommended, for example, the system could choose the one which provides not only the desired evidence, but also as widely-applicable as possible analysis for other sources which aren't the focus of reprocessing. Work being done in the SPA model variety problem (see <ref> [12, 27] </ref> and section 5 for more detail) indicates that the construction of such a graph is possible and practicable: [27] describes how the knowledge that an SPA is inappropriate for a small set A of signals can be extended to cover all signal sets U 24 where A U . <p> Work in this area would rely heavily on work being done at Boston University on the SPA model variety problem <ref> [12] </ref>. This problem focuses on the relationship between SPAs and the classes of signals for which they can produce undistorted outputs.

Reference-contexts: These observations place increased significance on intelligent systems' perceptual components and invite a critical examination of their current design paradigm. In traditional perceptual systems <ref> [14, 30] </ref>, the front-end signal processing is fixed, and interpretation processes are limited to analyzing only the single view afforded by that processing. "Fixed" front-end processing refers to the situation where signal processing algorithms (SPAs) are employed with fixed control parameter values.

Reference-contexts: In a data-driven mode, M is not bound and the parameter values are set to those of the front-end processing. After the SPA is applied, M is bound to the results. The method relies on Prolog's backtracking cuts <ref> [15] </ref> to limit parameter-value search. A cut is a point in the verification search space beyond which Prolog cannot backtrack.

Reference-contexts: Such a goal might be accomplished by temporarily monitoring only a few low-frequency spectral regions with a specialized, low-cost SPA such as Goertzel's algorithm <ref> [16] </ref> 2 . The traditional perceptual system design could implement such SPA switching within its fixed-front-end framework by applying each available SPA (both specialized and general) to the signal data and selectively examining the SPA-output streams when necessary.

Reference-contexts: Hayes-Roth's GUARDIAN system <ref> [17] </ref> incorporates an input-data management component that controls the sampling rate of signals in response to overall system workload constraints. The framework is typical of systems whose input data points already represent useful information and require little formal front-end processing other than to control the rate of information flow.

Reference-contexts: Instead, evidence from important sources or highly-reprocessed time regions might be profitably preserved for longer times than the defaults specified for their abstraction levels.

Reference-contexts: The control mechanism must also be able to focus on particular uncertainties in a context-sensitive manner.

Reference-contexts: Any deviations between observed signal behavior and available sig 9 nal event models are attributed to chance variations in the source being monitored, never to the signal's interaction with inappropriate SPAs or with other sources in the environment.

Reference-contexts: Research on the three capabilities will be carried out within the IPUS (Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals) sound understanding testbed developed in the Computer Science department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst <ref> [22] </ref>. The testbed's fundamental philosophy is that the search for SPAs appropriate to an environment's dynamic state must interact with the search for correct SPA output interpretations in a structured bi-directional manner. The following is a sketch of the IPUS framework's primary components and their relationships. <p> The IPUS architecture's basis is an iterative search technique for converging to the appropriate SPAs and parameter values. The following summarizes the technique; later sections and <ref> [22] </ref> provide a more detailed view of its components. The technique starts with a best guess for front-end SPAs and parameter values to process the input signal (an arbitrary set is used in the absence of environmental knowledge). <p> As an example of this, 6 This refers to the blending of word boundaries so that the spectral signatures of words in connected speech appear different from their signatures when uttered in isolation. 27 <ref> [22] </ref> describes an IPUS test scenario where two alternative sources are supported by the same evidence and reprocessing must be engaged to find evidence which will differentiate between them. <p> The integration of this mechanism with RESUN's SOU framework is an important open problem. A preliminary step has already been taken toward the tighter integration of discrepancy diagnosis with discrepancy detection and processing contexts <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In other acoustic domains such as speech recognition, this problem manifests itself in simultaneous multiple talker scenarios [32] and in the coarticulation effect <ref> [24] </ref> 6 of connected speech. It is true that the standard numeric-level approach to reprocessing via selective processing streams might work here and thus eliminate the need for model synthesis. One could conceivably filter out sources to find evidence for isolated models, and simply reprocess data for that evidence.

Reference-contexts: The cut mechanism also does not permit the use of diagnostic reasoning to further constrain parameter-value search based on the cause of an SPA predicate failure. Multiple views synthesis is related to the problem of sensor fusion <ref> [25] </ref> in that both tasks are concerned with the combination of evidence from different views of the same entity to produce a single data structure representing an interpretation system's perception of the entity.

Reference-contexts: Rather than attempt to model the entire universe in which the IPUS testbed exists and face the challenge of solving the frame problem <ref> [26] </ref> in all its generality, we will only consider the following limited set of assumptions for first-class representation.

Reference-contexts: The database contains a generic SPA for each algorithm class available to the IPUS system. An SPA instance is specified by values for a generic SPA's parameters, and has capabilities and limitations stemming from those values. As an illustration, consider the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm class <ref> [28] </ref>. An instance in this class results from particular values for its parameters, such as window length (number of data points analyzed at a time), frequency-sampling rate, temporal decimation factor (consecutive analysis window overlap), etc.

Reference-contexts: It models experts' use of SPA Fourier theory in diagnostic reasoning with a means-ends analysis framework incorporating multiple abstraction levels and a verification phase <ref> [29] </ref>. The KS accepts two inputs: an initial state representing expected signal behavior (expectation hypotheses and/or less precise but more reliable outputs from other SPAs) and a goal state representing the observed front-end SPA output. The initial state can include qualitative signal feature descriptions to handle uncertain and approximate information. <p> If it fails, the KS attempts to "patch" the sequence by finding operator subsequences that eliminate the unmet conditions and inserting them in the original sequence. One issue not addressed in <ref> [29] </ref> that arises in the IPUS framework is the problem of inapplicable explanations. Because of the KS's preference for short explanations, sometimes the first explanation offered by the KS will not enable the reprocessing mechanism to eliminate a discrepancy.

Reference-contexts: Assume that the system is supplied with a source-description database that in addition to A also contains a source B with a single frequency component in the same region as source A.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the KS mimics expert diagnostic reasoning in that it offers simplest explanations first <ref> [33] </ref>. Once a sequence is found, the KS enters its verify phase, "drops" to the lowest abstraction level available for the initial state, and checks that each operator's pre- and post-conditions are met when all available state information is considered.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation A key issue recognized across the machine-perception subdisciplines <ref> [21, 34, 36] </ref> in the development of next-generation intelligent systems is the ability to perceive and understand the complex environments in which they will operate. <p> Although this paper will focus on perception in the auditory modality, it should be noted that research toward adaptive front-end signal processing has also been recognized in the active computer vision community as an important next step in machine perception <ref> [36] </ref>. The selective processing streams capability is important to signal interpretation systems because it would permit the resolution or significant reduction of uncertainties associated with the application of SPAs inappropriate for monitoring the current state of the sources in a dynamic environment. <p> As a side benefit, work in generating the test suites' scenarios should also provide some insight into the design of benchmarks in the acoustic signal interpretation domain. In <ref> [36] </ref> the problem of designing benchmarks for visual interpretation systems has been identified as a significant research problem for the machine perception research field. 6 Acknowledgments This paper is based upon work supported by the Rome Air Development Center of the Air Force Systems Command under contract F30602-91-C-0038.
