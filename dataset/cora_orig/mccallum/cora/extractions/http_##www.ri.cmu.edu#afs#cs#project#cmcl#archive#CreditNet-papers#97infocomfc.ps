Title: Experimental Evaluation of ATM Congestion Control Mechanisms

Abstract: A critical issue in the design of fast packet-switch-based networks is the avoidance of data loss due to congestion. In the context of ATM networks, many link-level congestion control mechanisms for ABR tra-c have been proposed and simulated, and a few have been implemented. This paper presents, for the flrst time, an experimental comparison of several such mechanisms. To drive this comparison, we have developed a set of benchmarks that provide a quantitative characterization of congestion control performance. We also describe a simple but novel technique, the "virtual port card", for implementing both non-native switch behavior and long link delays in ATM networks. This technique allows us to compare a wide range of mechanisms on a single exible hardware platform. Our measurements show that while several of the ATM ow control mechanisms can eliminate cell loss, there are still several unresolved problems. First, for some traf-flc scenarios we see very poor application-level performance, especially in the presence of bursty tra-c. Second, performance is very sensitive to the ow control parameters and identifying an appropriate set of parameters is di-cult since it depends heavily on the tra-c conditions.
