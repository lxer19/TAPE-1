Reference-contexts: Furthermore, he is the major contributor in the theoretical aspects of the robot-design methodology that was brought into play . The kinematic sensitivity measure described in Section 3.1 was proposed by Professor Angeles and developed by the team <ref> (Angeles et al., 1996) </ref>. Mr. Mordechai Arenson, an M.Eng. student, has contributed to the practical aspects of the project. He was in charge of the conceptual and detailed mechanical design. When the 2D drawings were completed, he distributed and coordinated the machining and assembly of the robot. <p> The results of this research are detailed in <ref> (Angeles, Bulca, Arenson, and Arenson, 1996) </ref>. Briefly stated, the conclusion here is that the kinematic sensitivity of manipulators, whether redundant or not, is roughly proportional to the condition number of the underlying dimensionless Jacobian.

These parameters define the relative position and orientation of every two neighbouring robot axes.

Reference-contexts: Ms. Noga Arenson, an M.Eng. student, was responsible for the analyses of REDIESTRO 2. She developed computer programs for the static and kinematic analyses of the robot using MATLAB and M a a BILE <ref> (Kecskem ethy, 1993) </ref>. These calculations led to the actuator selection and specifica tion for the torque sensors. M a a a a BILE was also used for animation purposes. <p> designing the manipulator with a minimum condition number, its primary kinematic sensitivity would be taking care of automatically. 3.2 Static Analysis Parallel to the design of REDIESTRO 2, tools for its static analysis were developed, using M a a BILE , an object-oriented package for the modelling of multibody systems <ref> (Kecskem ethy, 12 1993) </ref>. M a a BILE is based on the object-oriented programming language C ++ , which gives it an open architecture for adding new objects. The users can customize M a a a a BILE according to their needs.

Reference-contexts: The MATLAB program that we used is an enhancement of the code developed by Mr. Farzam Ranjbaran during the design of REDIESTRO 1 <ref> (Ranjbaran, Angeles, Gonz alez-Palacios and Patel, 1995) </ref>. The optimization program finds a set of DH parameters for a given objective function; then, the skeleton rendering of the robot can be visualized and examined using RVS. RVS provides a very useful visual tool to determine the feasibility of the design. <p> In the function we construct back the DH parameters; then, we calculate the Jacobian matrix and the objective function. The fmins routine of Matlab has a search algorithm to find the minimum. For more details see <ref> (Ranjbaran et al., 1995) </ref>. 2.5.1 Details of the objective function If the Jacobian matrix J is isotropic, then JJ = ff 2 1 (2.1) where ff is the multiple nonzero singular value of J and 1 is the 6 fi 6 identity matrix.

Reference-contexts: However, we found that a manipulator with short final links will not eliminate the sensitivity problem reported by Canadair's Dr. Robins <ref> (Robins, 1995) </ref>. 2.3 Comparison of D and ND Manipulators D and ND manipulators serve different purposes. The former is chosen when the constrained wrist motion can be tolerated in exchange for simpler kinematics.
