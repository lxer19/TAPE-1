Reference-contexts: In this region the fluid flow is quite complex, since there are both incident and reflected waves, tidal flow effects, and turbulence and entrainment of air from wave breaking. The ridge-runnel system, so common in the near-beach zones in the American Northeast and in the Great Lakes <ref> [1] </ref>, is composed of a large bump 3 to 15 meters away from the beach, 2 about 0.3 meters high and up to perhaps 7 to 10 meters in length, which is preceded by a runnel. The runnel may or may not be scoured with small ripples. <p> The runnel may or may not be scoured with small ripples. The system is thought to be formed by storms eroding the beach and the dune fields and/or by tidal currents <ref> [1] </ref>. Davis et al. [1] provide observational evidence for their claim that storms seem to play a minor role in the evolution of these structures once they have formed. Tidal ridges, which were noticed by Off [2], are rhythmic features oriented parallel to the direction of tidal currents. <p> The runnel may or may not be scoured with small ripples.

Reference-contexts: Davis et al. [1] provide observational evidence for their claim that storms seem to play a minor role in the evolution of these structures once they have formed. Tidal ridges, which were noticed by Off <ref> [2] </ref>, are rhythmic features oriented parallel to the direction of tidal currents. They are 8 to 30 meters high, 7 to 60 kilometers long, and spaced 1 to 10 kilometers apart.

Reference-contexts: Tidal ridges, which were noticed by Off [2], are rhythmic features oriented parallel to the direction of tidal currents. They are 8 to 30 meters high, 7 to 60 kilometers long, and spaced 1 to 10 kilometers apart. Allen <ref> [3] </ref> found that their height is roughly proportional to the square root of their spacing and that they are composed of sand, silt, and mud. He reported that they occur where tidal currents reach at least 2 to 7 km/h and where there is an ample supply of sediment.

Reference-contexts: Sandbars are distributed in complicated patterns on the continental shelf, and it is sometimes difficult to discern which is a tidal ridge and which is a longshore sand ridge, the object of attention in this study. For example, Figure 1 taken from a paper by Swift <ref> [4] </ref> shows the relative orientation of different types of ridges. Note that some bars fan out around river deltas, while some are oriented parallel to or almost normal to the coast.

Reference-contexts: Other near-shore systems are found along the coasts of the Carolinas, Florida, the northern coast of Alaska, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and even large lakes such as Lake Michigan. McBride and Moslow <ref> [5] </ref> trace the origins of many of the sand ridge fields on the inner shelf of the Eastern U.S. to ebb-tidal delta deposition and the ensuing erosion from tidal flows. Longshore sand ridges can also be found in the farthest reaches of the shelf hugging every continent around the world. <p> The prevalence of the oblique orientation of the bars, has also been documented in <ref> [5] </ref> for the inner shelf. This study presents this extention to the original model to three-dimensions, it also clarifies several key issues that were not covered in the original presentation, and it also shows how realistic wave spectra can be incorporated in the form of wave packets [43].

Reference-contexts: These are the sand ridges of interest to us. Observations seem to indicate that a mean slope in the neighborhood of 0.02 to 0.05 favors the formation of longshore sand ridges <ref> [6] </ref>. Such ridges are composed mostly of fine sand and silt, sometimes of mud. The mean sediment particle size ranges between 0.1 and 0.5 millimeters. Groups of up to 12 ridges have been found that are more or less parallel to each other. <p> One possibility is that ridges are generated by major events such as storms, while another prospect is that they come about as a result of 3 systematic aspects of the surrounding fluid flows. Lau and Travis <ref> [6] </ref> found that sandbars beyond the breaker zone do not disappear but simply change location after a severe storm. <p> Short [8], in field measurements of sand ridges in Alaska, found a loose correlation between the ridge spacing and the average peak infragravity component wavelength. Lau and Travis <ref> [6] </ref> derived a drift velocity from a Stokes water-wave field for a bed with constant slope. Their model yields the spacing and the number of ridges from the periodicity of the drift velocity.

Reference-contexts: Their migration rates vary from place to place; for instance, the ridges on Sable Island Bank have been estimated to move at rates ranging from 0.5 meters per year, in water 60 meters deep, to 5 meters per year, in 30-meter depths <ref> [7] </ref>. Ridge fields are routinely found in regions where the water depth is small compared with the wavelength of an overlying internal wave environment with frequencies in the infragravity range [8]. It is clear that the formation and maintenance of these sedimentary structures are connected with the ambient hydrodynamics. <p> Hence, wae = flae n ; (53) where fl is the diffusivity constant. The flux, which is the product of the concentration and the velocity, can be split into a time-dependent part C t and a time-independent part C m . Boczar-Karakiewicz et al. <ref> [7] </ref> 18 found that in the sand ridge areas, the ratio C t =C m = O (10 2 ) for the off-shore case. This situation is assumed to apply throughout the shelf, so that the sediment concentration is represented solely by its time-independent part.

Preliminary data from the so-called Super Duck [9] experiments show this bar "reworking" as a consequence of major storms. <p> He did so at a time when few people saw anything fundamentally different about near-shore sandbars where a strong standing-wave field may be present, and bars or ridges far from the beach where little or no standing wave pattern is to be found. Short <ref> [8] </ref>, in field measurements of sand ridges in Alaska, found a loose correlation between the ridge spacing and the average peak infragravity component wavelength. Lau and Travis [6] derived a drift velocity from a Stokes water-wave field for a bed with constant slope.

Reference-contexts: Second, the effect of wind stresses on the boundary layer flows is quite significant in the nearshore. Third, while significant asymmetry exists in the velocity field in both areas, quite pronounced asymmetry can occur in the acceleration field in the nearshore case. Bijker et al. <ref> [10] </ref> made laboratory measurements of acceleration and velocity fields for water waves with fairly high Stokes numbers, in the range of 12-57. They found the net transport to be in the direction of the wave, particularly if the wave was very nonlinear.

Reference-contexts: They found the net transport to be in the direction of the wave, particularly if the wave was very nonlinear. Smaller particles seemed to be transported mostly by the Stokes flow, whereas larger particles responded in the main to the "acceleration" field. Hallermeier <ref> [11] </ref> analyzed a large experimental data set and found an empirical rule for the prediction of ripple characteristics based on the acceleration field, which suggests that this field may be an important sand-transport mechanism in the near-beach zone.

Elgar et al. <ref> [12] </ref> made measurements in the shoaling region, in water depths in the range of 1-6 meters, over a topography with mean slope of 5%, and confirmed in the field the existence of the velocity and acceleration field asymmetry.

Reference-contexts: Most researchers working on sediment transport assume an outer fluid flow at the edge of a boundary layer and attempt to model sediment motion on the bed and in the boundary layer. Sleath <ref> [13] </ref> presents a good review of the subject, and we therefore content ourselves with a cursory summary of the 4 various sedimentation models. A model developed by Bagnold [14,15] assumed that wave-induced oscillatory water motion causes sediment to move back and forth with a net expenditure of energy. <p> Hence, we adopt results from the Longuett-Higgins theory to characterize the effect of the water waves on the fluid motion in the boundary layer. Furthermore, since the ratio of bar height to separation is significantly below the critical value of 0.1 (which has been identified by Sleath <ref> [13] </ref> as the value over which flow in the boundary layer separates behind the crests of the bars and vortex formation takes place), the flow in the boundary layer is adequately characterized by the lowest-order dynamical quantities. <p> Chapalain [57] and Boczar-Karakiewicz et al. [58] concluded that time independent and vertically uniform parameters of eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity are adequate in providing satisfactory accuracy for sediment morphology models on the shelf. In this study we adopt a very simple model for the sediment concentration <ref> [13] </ref>. An equation of continuity for the sediment concentration is the advection-diffusion equation ae t + r (uae) + [(w v f )ae] n = 0; (52) where v f is the sediment "fall velocity" and n = (z + h (X; y; T ))=ffi bl .

Reference-contexts: Bagnold's model has also been used with some success in the near-shore zone, in a version that includes the effect of wind on sediment transport rate [19]. However, Bailard and Inman <ref> [15] </ref> found that the model did not perform adequately when the waves are not normally incident to the beach. Another sedimentation model by Raudkivi [20] and by Williams and Kemp [21] attributes the formation of ripples to a chance piling of sediment.

Reference-contexts: A threshold of motion parameter called the Shield's parameter is incorporated into the model to reflect the fact that a critical amount of energy must be imparted on the bed before transport can occur. Smith <ref> [16] </ref> and Fredsoe [17] applied this model to the ocean environment. They assumed a constant eddy viscosity and obtained criteria for the onset of instability and ripple formation.

They assumed a constant eddy viscosity and obtained criteria for the onset of instability and ripple formation. Richards <ref> [18] </ref> used instead a turbulent scale that increases linearly in height from the bed, thus obtaining two modes of instability that yield small- and large-scale ripples, respectively.

They use the fully three-dimensional, linearized water wave equations to compute the drift velocity, which in turn they couple to Bagnold's transport model for 5 suspended load. In particular, they examine the edge-wave case in an effort to compute the formation of crescentic bars in the shoaling region.

Reference-contexts: Bowen [28] has also examined the performance of this model in predicting the spacing of longshore ridges and reports good qualitative agreement with field observations. Laboratory and field observations indicate that standing wave patterns display a Bragg resonance process with an underlying wavy bottom <ref> [29] </ref> [30]. In a steady-state situation, the ripples develop a spacing that is roughly half the local average length of the water waves. This first-order theory [29,31-33] is applicable in principle to the near-shore environment, since it relies on the scouring effect of a standing wave pattern. <p> They made use of the SRIT (slightly resonant interacting triads) approximation developed by Lau and Barcilon [39] and Mei and Umluata [31] for weakly nonlinear shallow-water waves to solve approximately for the wave motion. 6 Boczar-Karakiewicz conducted a number of interesting field and laboratory studies <ref> [29] </ref> [40]. In the analysis of her findings [41], she combined the hydrodynamic approximation of Lau and Barcilon with the boundary-layer theory of Longuett-Higgins [22]. <p> If a standing-wave pattern exists in the surface waves, whether it be a result of linear or nonlinear effects, the scouring effect of the waves presumably generates ripples 7 obeying a Bragg scattering mechanism (see <ref> [29] </ref>). This is a first-order phenomenon whose effectiveness in influencing the shape of the bottom topography relies on the existence of both a reflected and an incident wave. Generally, the reflected component becomes weaker and weaker the further it travels seaward. <p> This scaling was proposed independently in [52], but is actually not new. It is known as the "parabolic approximation" [53]. 11 2.2 Description of the Bottom Topography Let T = O (ff 0 t), where Laboratory data <ref> [29] </ref> suggests that there are several time scales in this problem: a fast time scale t, and slower time scale o = O (fft), which measure the evolution of the fluid quantities.

Reference-contexts: Since the undertow and the local bed slope are significant and since the effect of the wind in generating stresses on the surface of the ocean must be taken into account, modeling the formation of runnels is very difficult. Russell and Osorio [35] and Bijker et al. <ref> [36] </ref> found that on a sloping beach, the mass transport velocity near the bed was onshore before breaking and offshore after. This effect, which seems to be independent of wave reflection from the beach, may explain why these bar systems are usually found close to the plunge line of breakers.

Reference-contexts: This effect, which seems to be independent of wave reflection from the beach, may explain why these bar systems are usually found close to the plunge line of breakers. Huthnance <ref> [37] </ref> developed a theory for the formation of tidal ridges based on an instability that is triggered by a small protuberance on the shelf. The ensuing boundary layer develops a bar that is fed by bedload.

Reference-contexts: Huthnance's study does not address the periodic nature of these bars, nor does it suggest a relation between their height and spacing. Among the first to suggest that infragravity standing waves may be responsible for long-shore sand ridge formation was Suhaida <ref> [38] </ref>. He did so at a time when few people saw anything fundamentally different about near-shore sandbars where a strong standing-wave field may be present, and bars or ridges far from the beach where little or no standing wave pattern is to be found.

To begin, we note that the motion of the entire fluid body can be determined once the free surface motion is known. <p> Consider the Hamiltonian E = E (j; ). The choice of label E reflects the fact that the Hamiltonian for this problem is conserved and is numerically equal to the sum of the potential energy V and the the kinetic energy K. As shown by Benjamin and Olver <ref> [48] </ref>, the evolution of the free surface is given by the Hamiltonian system j t = ffiE ffi ffiE ffij ; (3) where E is the Hamiltonian. We specialize Equation (3) for the case of weakly nonlinear shallow-water waves.

Reference-contexts: The version given by Equations (7) and (8), however, has a couple of troublesome characteristics from the standpoint of modelling a physical situation. Specifically, the system is linearly unstable and rather poor at conveying accurately the full dispersion relation <ref> [51] </ref>. The instability can be shown by the substitution of plane wave solutions into the linearized version of Equation (8), and the degree to which the equation's dispersion relation differs appreciably from the full-water wave dispersion is most apparent for the higher wavenumbers.
