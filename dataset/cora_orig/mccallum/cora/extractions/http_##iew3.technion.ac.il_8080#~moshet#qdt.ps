Abstract: This paper investigates the foundation of maximin, one of the central qualitative decision criteria, using the approach taken by Savage (Savage 1972) to investigate the foundation and rationality of classical decision theory. This approach asks "which behaviors could result from the use of a particular decision procedure?" The answer to this question provides two important insights: (1) under what conditions can we employ a particular agent model, and (2) how rational is a particular decision procedure. Our main result is a constructive representation theorem in the spirit of Savage's result for expected utility maximization, which uses two choice axioms to characterize the maximin criterion. These axioms characterize agent behaviors that can be modeled compactly using the maximin model, and, with some reservations, indicate that maximin is a reasonable decision criterion.

Reference-contexts: More recently, the realization that decision making is a central task of artificial agents has led to much interest in this area within the artificial intelligence research community. Some of the more recent work on decision theory in AI concentrates on qualitative decision making tools. For example, Boutilier <ref> (Boutilier 1994) </ref> and Tan and Pearl (Tan & Pearl 1994) examine semantics and specification tools for qualitative decision makers, while Darwiche and Goldszmidt (Darwiche & Goldszmidt 1994) experiment with qualitative probabilistic reasoning in diagnostics. There are two major reasons for this interest in qualitative tools.

There are two major reasons for this interest in qualitative tools. One reason is computational efficiency: one hopes that qualitative tools, because of their simplicity, will lead to faster algorithms. <p> Qualitative decision procedures could offer such an alternative, but the question is: how rational are they? One method of addressing this question is experimentation, as in <ref> (Darwiche & Goldszmidt 1994) </ref>. However, the prominent approach for understanding and justifying the rationality of decision criteria has been the axiomatic approach. This approach characterizes the properties of a decision criterion in a general, domain independent manner.

Reference-contexts: The agent starts at some initial state of information and chooses one of its possible actions based on its current state of information (i.e., its local state); this function is called the agent's policy (see also protocol <ref> (Fagin et al. 1995) </ref> and strategy (Luce & Raiffa 1957)). This policy maps each state of information of the agent into an action. Definition 2 A policy for agent (LocalStates; Actions) is a function P : LocalStates ! Actions.
