Abstract: To clarify more precisely the vague but often indicated connection between wavelet and multi-grid theory is the main goal of the article. Therefore we present a multi-level method based on a wavelet approximation of the succesive error of a classical iterative solver. The resulting iteration is a hybrid between a purely algebraic multi-level technique and the usual multi-grid technique related to a discretization of an elliptic differential operator. It shows the typical multi-grid convergence behaviour, even if it is not able to compete at this stage with the efficient multi-grid iterations. Nevertheless, our new approach has the capacity to solve linear equations arising from the discretization of integral operators of the first kind by multi-level techniques.

Reference-contexts: In signal analysis they are well suited for a phase space representation of signals [6] as well as the detection of edges and singularities [10,19]. Because of their localization in phase space they are also of interest in quantum field theory <ref> [1] </ref>. Meanwhile in the last three years wavelets have appeared in numerical analysis. But their applications in this field are mostly theoretical so far. Some others are practical, e.g. in [2] the authors introduce a rapid algorithm for the application of a class of linear operators to arbitrary vectors. <p> Lemma 2.5 Suppose u is an element of the Sobolev space H 2 (0; 1) = fw 2 L 2 (0; 1) j w 0 ; w 00 2 L 2 g with u (0) = u (1) = 0 ( u is continuous in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, cf. Ciarlet [4]). Let the operator T h : H 2 (0; 1) ! IR n be defined by (T h u) k = u ((k + 1) h), k = 0; : : :; n 1, h = 1=(n + 1).
