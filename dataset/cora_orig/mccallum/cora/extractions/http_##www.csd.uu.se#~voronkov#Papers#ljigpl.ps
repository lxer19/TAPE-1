Title: Proof-Search in Intuitionistic Logic Based on Constraint Satisfaction and Related Complexity Problems  
Author: Andrei Voronkov 
Keyword: intuitionistic logic, automated reasoning, complexity, derivation skeletons.  
Abstract: We characterize provability in intuitionistic predicate logic in terms of derivation skeletons and constraints and study the problem of instantiations of a skeleton to valid derivations. We prove that for two different notions of a skeleton the problem is respectively polynomial and NP-complete. As an application of our technique, we demonstrate PSPACE-completeness of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic. We outline some applications of the proposed technique in automated reasoning.
