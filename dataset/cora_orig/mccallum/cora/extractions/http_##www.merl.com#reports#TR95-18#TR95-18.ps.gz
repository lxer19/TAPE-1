Abstract: We present a simple system for interactively specifying lighting parameters, including position, for high-quality image synthesis. Unlike inverse approaches to the lighting-design problem, we do not require the user to indicate a priori the desired illuminative characteristics of an image. In our approach the computer proposes, culls, and organizes a set of candidate lights automatically, using an elementary measure of image similarity as the basis for both culling and organization. The user then browses the set of candidate-light images, selects which lights to include, and combines them as desired. This work is a particular instance of a general strategy | sampling a design space broadly and intelligently and organizing the results for rapid browsing by the user | This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: The third and final level in the hierarchy is accessed in the same way. Any of the images in the hierarchy can be copied using drag-and-drop into the palette at lower right. Higher-resolution copies of the thumbnails in the palette are combined (exploiting the additive nature of light <ref> [1] </ref>) to produce the final image, displayed at lower left. This step takes at most a few seconds, because the higher-resolution images were rendered previously during the culling step (Section 2.2).
