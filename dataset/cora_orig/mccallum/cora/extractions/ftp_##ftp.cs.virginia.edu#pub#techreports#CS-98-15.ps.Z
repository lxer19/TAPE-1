Abstract: We propose that providing multiple viewpoints of a document collection and allowing users to move among these viewpoints during a search or browse session will facilitate the location of useful documents. In this paper, we present the results of preliminary experiments that illustrate the potential benefits of this approach. These experiments utilize a full text view and a manually assigned topic descriptor view. We propose a measure for determining the amount of agreement among topic descriptors assigned to documents and show results for the TREC [7] SJMN and ZIFF collections. For those same collections, we then show the potential retrieval improvement when the two viewpoints are utilized.

Reference-contexts: The goal of the Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC) is to "encourage research in information retrieval from large text applications by providing a large test collection, uniform scoring procedures, and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their results." <ref> [1] </ref> TREC participants are furnished with (1) collections of documents, (2) sets of queries 1 that are statements of information needs (many of the queries are several paragraphs long), and (3) a relevance judgements file.

Reference-contexts: We will show that the combination of results from two views of a collection produces results that are an improvement upon the results of either of the constituent views. This confirms that the behavior reported in <ref> [2, 11] </ref> can be observed when multiple views of the collection are used. 3 Motivation There can potentially be many views of a document collection.

Reference-contexts: These indexes were constructed with SMART version 11 2 using document indexing parameters lnc and query indexing parameters ltc. These parameters determine the weights of features in the indexes; these specific parameters have been shown to work well for TREC collections <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Additional information about the parameters is available in the SMART documentation. The full text index was constructed by indexing all available document information for the documents in SJM N 0 and ZIF F 0 (including the topic descriptor field).

Reference-contexts: The library and information science literature contains a number of studies specifically investigating subject searching within online public access catalogs (OPACs). In general, subject searching in this context has been considered as a specific activity, not in conjunction with other types of searching. Drabenstott and Weller <ref> [5] </ref> note that lists of subject categories for browsing are often longer than a user is willing to deal with.

Reference-contexts: The ZIFF collection consists mainly of computer-related articles published in Ziff Publishing publications from 1988 to 1992. However, the ZIFF articles located on TREC disk 3 contain a large number of short product-description articles <ref> [6] </ref>. While some of the product-description articles had been assigned topic descriptors, the articles themselves were of low quality for our experiments. There was generally very little text in the articles.

Reference-contexts: Instead, CHESHIRE II allows users to specify either Boolean queries with unranked results or natural language queries with probabilistically ranked results. Users can also specify both and see the merged results of both types of searches. Ingwersen <ref> [8] </ref> argues for multiple representations of a user's cognitive state in addition to multiple representations of items in an information space. We will show that the combination of results from two views of a collection produces results that are an improvement upon the results of either of the constituent views.

Reference-contexts: However, no relevance judgements or user interactions are required so there is no guarantee that the topic information from the top-ranked retrieved documents captures the user's intentions. However, the results of Srinivasan's experiments illustrate the utility of utilizing topic information. In the CHESHIRE system, Larson <ref> [9] </ref> employed the classification clustering approach to expand the vocabulary that could be used to access a bibliographic record. This approach clustered MARC bibliographic records by call number. <p> Cluster summaries, including the most frequently occurring subject headings were then displayed to a user; call numbers from user-selected clusters were incorporated into a reformulated query that returned individual records. In addition to his description of the CHESHIRE system, Larson <ref> [9, p. 136-139] </ref> also provides an overview of studies that illustrate the problem of creating effective subject searches. The library and information science literature contains a number of studies specifically investigating subject searching within online public access catalogs (OPACs).

Reference-contexts: Both sets of experiments showed that combinations of query representations were beneficial. The results of the independent experiments were combined in a larger data fusion experiment. In general, the combinations outperformed the inputs. The classification clustering functionality of CHESHIRE is still available in CHESHIRE II <ref> [10] </ref>, but this is no longer the main focus. Instead, CHESHIRE II allows users to specify either Boolean queries with unranked results or natural language queries with probabilistically ranked results. Users can also specify both and see the merged results of both types of searches.

Reference-contexts: We propose that our use of multiple views of a collection can help direct searchers to useful topic areas. Research in query combination and data fusion has shown that using multiple document representations and/or multiple formulations of an information need can improve retrieval performance. Ra-jashekar and Croft <ref> [11] </ref> report a number of experiments using multiple query and documents representations in the INQUERY system. They performed experiments using single representations of queries with one, two or three representations of documents and two or three representations of queries with one document representation. <p> We will show that the combination of results from two views of a collection produces results that are an improvement upon the results of either of the constituent views. This confirms that the behavior reported in <ref> [2, 11] </ref> can be observed when multiple views of the collection are used. 3 Motivation There can potentially be many views of a document collection.

Reference-contexts: Srinivasan <ref> [12, 13] </ref> has conducted a series of experiments in which documents are represented by both full text and subject information. Given an initial query, subject terms from the highest ranking retrieved documents are added to the initial query. The reformulated query is then issued.
