Abstract: The design and implementation of a shared libraries facility for Sun's implementation of the UNIX operating system (SunOS) is described. Shared libraries extend the resource utilitization benefits obtained from sharing code between processes running the same program to processes running different programs by sharing the libraries common to them. In this design, shared libraries are viewed as the result of the application of several more basic system mechanisms, specifically

Reference-contexts: The goal to not change library source was a direct consequence of not having the resources to change the large amount of library code already in existence. Even source alterations such as those used with System V shared libraries <ref> [ARNO 86] </ref> appeared more than we wished to do. Administrative: There should be no requirement to administer and coordinate the allocation of address space.

Reference-contexts: Memory Sharing The mechanism that provides our memory sharing is a new Virtual Memory (VM) system for SunOS. Although more completely described elsewhere <ref> [GING 87] </ref>, the principal features of the new system include: file mapping as its principal mechanism, accessed by programs through the mmap (2) system call; sharing at the granularity of a file page; and a per-page copy-on-write facility to allow run-time modification of a shared object without affecting other users of

Reference-contexts: A ``shared library'' is added to the address space in exactly the same way, using the general file mapping mechanism.
