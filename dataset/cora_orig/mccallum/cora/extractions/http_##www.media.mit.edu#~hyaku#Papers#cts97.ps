Abstract: Concept-to-Speech (CTS) systems, which aim to synthesize speech from semantic information and discourse context, have succeeded in producing more appropriate and natural-sounding prosody than text-to-speech (TTS) systems, which rely mostly on syntactic and orthographic information. In this paper, we show how recent advances in CTS systems can be used to improve intonation in text reading systems for English. Specifically, following (Prevost, 1995; Pre-vost, 1996), we show how information structure is used by our program to produce intonational patterns with context-appropriate variation in pitch accent type and prominence. Following (Cahn, 1994; Cahn, 1997), we also show how some of the semantic information used by such CTS systems can be drawn from WordNet (Miller et al.,

Reference-contexts: Based on previous intonation generation work (Pre-vost and Steedman, 1994), thematic and rhe-matic items requiring accentuation are assigned L+H* and H* pitch accents respectively. The notion that large databases in TTS systems can substitute for application-specific knowledge bases has been suggested by (Horne et al., 1993) and <ref> (Cahn, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While this presents a number of difficulties for dividing utterances ilar to Gussenhoven's division of utterances into focus domains <ref> (Gussenhoven, 1983) </ref>. Once propositional constituents have been determined, the algorithm applies a number of heuristics to sub-divide each into theme and rheme. We consider two possible segmentation points: before the verb-complex and after the verb-complex.

Reference-contexts: Within each category, lexical meaning is represented by synonym sets (synsets) organized around semantic relationships. Polysemous words are represented by multiple synsets, one for each word sense. The release used in this work, WordNet 1.5, contains a total of 91,591 synsets and 168,135 word senses <ref> (Miller, 1995) </ref>. Types of semantic relationships between synsets vary by category. The basic structure of each is discussed briefly below. 3.0.1 Nouns The nouns category is the largest and semantically richest of the four. It contains 60,557 synsets, grouped into 25 different topical hierarchies.

Reference-contexts: our results. 2 Semantic and Discourse Effects on Intonation The effects of "givenness" on the accentabil-ity of lexical items has been examined in some detail and has led to the development of intonation algorithms for both text-to-speech (Hirschberg, 1990; Hirschberg, 1993; Mon-aghan, 1991; Terken and Hirschberg, 1994) and concept-to-speech systems <ref> (Monaghan, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While this mapping of thematic constituents onto intonational tunes is certainly an oversimplification, it has been quite useful in previous concept-to-speech work. We are currently using the Boston University radio news corpus <ref> (Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1995) </ref> to compile statistics to support our use of this mapping. 3 Preliminary results show that the H* accent is most prevalent, occurring more than fifty percent of the time. !H* and L+H* occur less frequently than H*, but more than any of the other possible accents. <p> Our preliminary approach is based on a number of heuristics, and generally performs quite well. Nonetheless, we expect this module to be substantially refined once we have concluded our empirical analysis of the Boston University radio news corpus <ref> (Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1995) </ref>. The theme/rheme identification algorithm begins by trying to identify propositional constituents within utterances. As noted in Section 2, a single utterance may contain several clauses corresponding to several semantic propositions. Propositional constituents are centered around verb occurrences. <p> Another area for improvement concerns the prominence of pitch accents. Based on our preliminary results, we believe that the L+H* accents should be somewhat lower than those shown in Figures 4 and 5. Once we have completed our analysis of the Boston University radio news corpus <ref> (Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1995) </ref>, we expect to modify the accent prominences based on our findings.

Reference-contexts: Following Cahn's proposal (Cahn, 1994) and implementation (Cahn, 1997), we employ WordNet to identify lexical items related by synonymy, hy-pernymy or hyponymy, and also to identify contrastive lexical items. However, our use of information structure situates our work in a different theoretical framework from Cahn's. 1 (Steedman, 1991) and <ref> (Prevost and Steedman, 1994) </ref> show how the correspondence between intonational phrasing and semantic constituency can be modeled by Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), a formalism allowing a more flexible notion of syntactic constituency. <p> In the simplest case, where an utterance conveys a single proposition, the division into theme and rheme is often straightforward, as shown in the question/answer pair in Figure 1. (Steedman, 1991) and <ref> (Prevost and Steed-man, 1994) </ref> argue that for the class of utterances exemplified by these examples, the rheme of the utterance often occurs with an intonational (intermediate) phrase carrying the H* L-L% (H* L-) tune, while the theme, when it bears any marked intonational features, often carries the L+H* L-L% (L+H* L-)

Reference-contexts: Incorporating a sense disambiguation algorithm, such as that discussed in <ref> (Resnik, 1995) </ref>, is a logical next step. Word matches are also limited to comparisons between individual words within a single part-of-speech category. Extending consideration to adjacent words and semantic roles would greatly reduce the number of spurious matches generated by the system.
