Title: SOME THOUGHTS ON A FIRST COURSE IN LINEAR ALGEBRA AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL Running head:

Abstract: This paper has two purposes: to react to the recommendations of the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG) and of David Carlson (one of the organizers of the LACSG), and to begin consideration of an alternative approach to helping students learn linear algebra. The LACSG efforts to bring linear algebra into the overall undergraduate curriculum reform movement are laudable. There are some concerns with their approach, however, and this paper attempts to raise some questions concerning the lack of a body of research establishing a need for curriculum reform in linear algebra, the apparent identification, in the LACSG recommendations, of abstract with useless (and hence, by negation, the equating of concrete with useful) and the assumption that performing calculations with matrices (even intriguing operations) is the same as applying mathematical ideas so as to meet the needs of client departments. The alternative proposed here | not in the spirit of replacement but in the sense of letting one more flower bloom | is an extension to linear algebra of an overall curriculum reform project. This project involves learning mathematics by programming in a mathematical-oriented programming language, extensive use of cooperative learning, and the development of alternatives to the lecture method. The discussion of the alternative in this paper is far from complete. It is, rather, an attempt to make a beginning of mapping out a project that will apply to linear algebra an approach that is having some success in precalculus, calculus, discrete mathematics and abstract algrebra.

Reference-contexts: It is better to be explicit, and so I will begin by describing the paradigm for the research discussed here. For a more detaied discussion with several examples and references, see <ref> [1] </ref> by the RUMEC group. The paradigm is neither the mathematical analysis cum laboratory experiment cum confirmation/rejection method of the physical sciences, nor is it the treatment/control cum statistical analysis approach favored in psychology and the social sciences. <p> Although the first two are extremely important, we have found that in their general formulations, it has not been necessary to change very much in moving from one course to another. These formulations are discussed in <ref> [1] </ref> and we will not consider them here. Of course the task of working out the specifics for linear algebra will take some effort and this must be done as part of the actual development of the course once that begins. Use of computers. <p> Surely the graph of a function is an object and students will treat it as such. Similarly, the linear functional v described above may be considered as an object | the triple <ref> [1; 1; 2] </ref>. Again there is little difficulty in getting students to think about such triples as objects. I think that both examples represent important pedagogical errors and a misinterpretation of our theory. <p> This explains why so many students can work with graphs and perform various operations with them, but cannot interpret them or relate them to the function's process. Similarly, students who think about our v as the object <ref> [1; 1; 2] </ref> may have difficulty in understanding its relationship to the process involved in this function. Some examples. I would like to consider three kinds of examples. First, I will discuss finite dimensional vector spaces over finite fields at a fairly detailed level.

Reference-contexts: In the first place, there seems to be a "conventional wisdom" (in which I concur) that the existing curriculum in linear algebra is not successful in terms of what is learned by students who take the first course. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence. David Carlson <ref> [3] </ref> says that his students become "confused and disoriented" when faced with ideas such as subspaces, spanning, and linear independence, and Harel points out that both high school and university students encounter difficulty with the basic notions of linear algebra [12]. <p> In <ref> [3] </ref>, Carlson adds three more important points: * Major topics in elementary linear algebra that give students difficulty are speci fied. * Reasons for these difficulties are suggested. * A set of problems for students is presented to deal with these difficulties. <p> Otherwise, I think that it is a reasonable list and I predict that detailed study would show that these are indeed the main trouble spots for students. Carlson <ref> [3] </ref> lists four reasons for the difficulties with subspaces, spans and linear independence/dependence. Here is my interpretation of what he is saying: 1. The course is taught too early and the students are too unsophisticated. 2. <p> This is a call for a program of research and development that goes far beyond the suggestion that we get students to work hard in performing matrix manipulations, 6 which is the main explicit pedagogical suggestion in <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, my disagreement with Carlson on this point is that his explanation of the difficulties is not rich enough to suggest remedies that, in my opinion, have a good chance of being effective. <p> For example, I wonder which makes students more uncomfortable, the notion of a subspace (in terms of the axioms and standard examples) or notation such as the following which appears in <ref> [3, p.34] </ref>. k X b jk col j (A) I, for one, would not bet that in a popularity contest with students the sigma notation would win out over formal definitions and examples of subspaces. There are also some aspects of the syllabus to which I take exception.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG) has made an important contribution to curriculum reform in mathematics. In general, they have placed linear algebra on the agenda and in particular, they have developed a set of recommendations for a first course in linear algebra <ref> [4] </ref>. By holding conferences and generating publications (such as the present volume) they have initiated and maintained a level of activity which is necessary if the mathematical community is going to engender revision of the linear algebra curriculum that will be accepted by the community as a whole. <p> The second point I wish to consider in this paper has to do with the LACSG-proposed first course in linear algebra as described in <ref> [4] </ref>. In my opinion, the main issues which this proposal addresses are: the major difficulties students have with linear algebra and their causes, and the principle that the course should be oriented towards applications and operations with matrices. <p> It appears to me that there are three major aspects of the LACSG article <ref> [4] </ref>: * It is recommended that the course should be recognized as a service course and should relate closely to applications of linear algebra. * It is recommended that the course should be matrix-oriented. * A fairly detailed syllabus is proposed.

Reference-contexts: Although I do not reject the LACSG proposal completely, I would like to raise certain questions about it relating to these ideas and their implementation in the recommended syllabus. Finally, although I will not propose anything so complete as what we have from 1 See <ref> [5] </ref> for a summary of reports that provide such information for calculus. 2 LACSG, I would like to suggest an alternative program of research and curriculum development that could lead to a course that is quite different from what LACSG has proposed. This is not a bad situation. <p> example, if the students are too unsophisticated and the course should be given later, is it enough just to wait? Are we prepared to assert that another year of college courses will significantly improve the mathematical sophistication of undergraduates? The reports we are receiving from national studies suggest otherwise (see <ref> [5] </ref> and the references in it.) The effect of another year of coursework is more likely to lead to fewer students taking mathematics and, for those that remain, a stronger conviction that mathematics consists of, in the words of Ed Moise, a repertoire of imitative behavior patterns [15].

Reference-contexts: He proposes to use, for a given concept such as the structure of 9 a vector space, a teaching sequence, based on an epistemological analysis, in which he creates an artifical context which motivates the development of the vector space axioms by the students themselves <ref> [6] </ref>. Guershon Harel has developed and implemented a linear algebra course for high school students. His approach (see [13]) involves a gradual abstraction that develops in three phases.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that writing the following computer program (in the language ISETL <ref> [7] </ref>) will help students construct this process. v := func (x); $ x is a vector in R3, represented as a tuple. return x (1) + x (2) - 2*x (3); end; It turns out that very many processes in mathematics can be implemented on the computer in such a simple

Reference-contexts: This is a very serious problem because of how difficult quantification is for students. In [9] we give a description of the extensive mental growth required to develop a reasonable conception of quantification and in <ref> [8] </ref> we describe one approach to helping students achieve such growth. Our approach shows indications of being effective, but it takes some time and would have to be in a course other than (and preliminary to) a first course in linear algebra.

Reference-contexts: Computer constructions and mental constructions. In this general discussion, we will be concerned with the two most important mental constructions | processes and objects. For a fuller account of the history and nature of our use of computers, see <ref> [10] </ref>. Understanding a process is difficult in part because, as I indicated earlier, it is hard to visualize a process.

Reference-contexts: There is plenty of anecdotal evidence. David Carlson [3] says that his students become "confused and disoriented" when faced with ideas such as subspaces, spanning, and linear independence, and Harel points out that both high school and university students encounter difficulty with the basic notions of linear algebra <ref> [12] </ref>. There is not, however, a body of research that provides evidence that would convince a skeptic of the lack of success of linear algebra courses. <p> I would add to this list the geometric interpretation of the action of a linear transformation and I would make the point that applications are not always very easy for students (see Harel <ref> [12] </ref>). Otherwise, I think that it is a reasonable list and I predict that detailed study would show that these are indeed the main trouble spots for students. Carlson [3] lists four reasons for the difficulties with subspaces, spans and linear independence/dependence. <p> The third phase deals with vector spaces whose elements are undefined but their dimensions are one, two and three. In <ref> [12] </ref> Harel provides data on the effectiveness of his method. One observation I would make about Harel's approach is that it focuses on the objects of linear algebra that is, vectors and their various relationships such as membership in a subspace, geometric and coordinate representations, etc.

Reference-contexts: Guershon Harel has developed and implemented a linear algebra course for high school students. His approach (see <ref> [13] </ref>) involves a gradual abstraction that develops in three phases. The first phase deals with visual geometric models of vector space notions such as subspace, basis and dimension, in two and three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: See [18] for a study of this question. There is a new textbook by Banchoff and Wermer [2] which supports a curricular approach which has many similarities to Harel's program and also tries to deal with linear transformations. Finally, I would mention the paper of Hern and Long <ref> [14] </ref> which is not a discussion of pedagogy so much as a very thorough description of the effect of linear transformations on various geometrical objects in two and three dimensions. These include circles and spheres, rectangles and parallelopipeds, and triangles and tetrahedra. <p> First, I will discuss finite dimensional vector spaces over finite fields at a fairly detailed level. Second, I would like to set a challenge for synthesizing the ideas behind our approach and the material in the paper of Hern and Long <ref> [14] </ref>. Finally, I would describe somewhat vaguely an approach to helping students understand vector spaces of functions. 20 We already mentioned the importance of vector spaces over fields such as Z n . Let us consider the vector space V of all triples of elements of Z 3 . <p> This can lead to investigation and construction of understanding of the difference between a matrix of rank 1 and a matrix of rank 2 in terms of transformations of a square, invariant subspaces, eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These investigations can also be applied to transition matrices of Markov chains. (See <ref> [14] </ref> for a discussion of the mathematics that would be very helpful in developing such instruction.) Any development of instruction along these lines would have to be preceeded, of course, by a theoretical analysis that would guide the development of the instruction and would be refined as the results of that

Reference-contexts: AN ALTERNATIVE Work that has been done Before discussing the approach I am suggesting, let me say something about work of others in linear algebra education that is not necessarily connected with the LACSG. There has been some but not a great deal. Jerry Porter <ref> [17] </ref> describes an interesting pedagogical approach in a linear algebra course for non-math majors. He uses a text that is strong on applications but less thorough on the theoretical underpinnings.
