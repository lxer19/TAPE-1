Title: A Classification of Communicating Agents

Abstract: There are many mechanisms with which agents in multi-agent systems can communicate. These mechanisms can be described in various ways, depending on the aims of those running the system concerned. This paper proposes a classification system for such communication methods so that they can be described in a standard way and be more easily compared to other such systems. Part of the classification consists of a coded definition, facilitating automisation of some development.

Reference-contexts: This means that designers often to do not consider the form that communication will take in a finished system as communication can be assumed to be perfect. This is often done by simply using shared memory to simulate the communication interfaces between agents, as in <ref> (Arkin et al., 1993) </ref>. (Dudek et al., 1993) go some way to classifying communication systems in their taxonomy for swarm robots.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth is divided into high, motion, low and zero (this is judged on a cost basis). The point to notice here is that some grouping is necessary in every case it is very difficult to cover every case explicitly. Other classifications, such as those in <ref> (Ashiru & Czarnecki, 1998) </ref> are too abstract to be particularly useful.

Reference-contexts: is usually the result of work where the physical implementation of the communication is not so important as the actual protocol used, as opposed to the above cases where communication is either not really considered, or is considered in detail but with the whole of the rest of the system. <ref> (Balch & Arkin, 1994) </ref> comes quite close to defining a useful classification of inter-agent communication. Here, communicating systems are divided by factors such as implicit/explicit communication and the type of data sent. <p> What they then do with that information is irrelevant in this case. A discussion of this implicit form of communication appears in <ref> (Balch & Arkin, 1994) </ref>. A slightly less clear level 1 system would be one similar to that described in (Hackwood & Beni, 1992). Such a system involves `signpost robots' that can change the state of other robots that come near.

Reference-contexts: In this class of system the agents may not even be aware of other agents as anything other than objects. They also ignore any form of environmental change effected by another agent, as otherwise indirect communication would be taking place. <ref> (Brooks et al., 1990) </ref> describes such a system. A system with a rating of 1 uses `implicit' communication. This is where the action of agents on the environment can be used as data by other agents without the `transmitting' agent taking any special action.

The system includes information on the configuration of swarm robots and other swarm-specific aspects and so is not directly comparable to this work, but is nevertheless interesting for its breakdown of communication.

A system such as this might be rated as 1 if the signpost robots were constant, regardless of any events or the identity of the robot.

Reference-contexts: This allows the designer to test every possible form of interface easily and choose the best available to build into the final physical design. This sort of functionality is suggested as a positive step in robotics in <ref> (Mataric, 1998) </ref> and other articles on the continuation of robotics research. 4 Summary and Conclusions This classification system achieves two goals. Firstly it enables a simple numerical representation of communication complexity which is useful for comparing different communication systems.

Reference-contexts: The classification used is closer to the method described here, but still has too much of the actual protocol included. It is also not general enough as it concentrates on the tasks described. Mataric <ref> (Mataric, Autumn 1997) </ref> uses a similar system. She splits communication into two forms, direct and indirect. Direct communication is a communicative act with the sole purpose of transmitting information. Indirect communication is based on observed behaviour. <p> This form of communication is much more flexible because information can flow in two ways. Even if it does not, the receiving agents can send acknowledgments to the transmitting agent, making the system more robust. <ref> (Mataric, Autumn 1997) </ref> is a good example of this, with the agents broadcasting their sensory information to others to eliminate sensor blind spots. This sort of communication can also be used to formulate a simple language, as in (Yanco, 1994).
