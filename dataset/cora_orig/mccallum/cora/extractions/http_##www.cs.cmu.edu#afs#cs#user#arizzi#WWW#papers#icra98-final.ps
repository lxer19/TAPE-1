Title: Hybrid Control as a Method for Robot Motion Programming  
Author: Alfred A. Rizzi 
Affiliation: Leuven Belgium  Microdynamic Systems Laboratory The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Date: May 1998  
Note: Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Robotics and Automation  
Abstract: This paper presents a class of fundamental control policies suitable for use in a novel method for designing and specifying the dynamic motion of robotic systems. Through recourse to formal stability mechanisms a hybrid control strategy (one that relies on switching of underlying continious policies) with desirable performance characteristics is demonstrated to be both stable and expressive for programming such motions. The long term intent is to utilize slightly more general control methods of this form to drastically simplify the process of integrating and programming modular automated assembly systems.

Reference-contexts: And while much progress has been made on the development of new and more capable mechanisms, there has been only minimal progress at providing new paradigms for programming or instructing these mechanisms. The ideas presented here are complimentary to some early ideas on task level programming of dynamic tasks <ref> [2, 1] </ref>, but focus instead on how collections of controllers can be used to simplify the task of programming the behavior of a generic mechanism. <p> We then say that controller 1 prepares controller 2 , denoted 1 - 2 , if its goal lies within the domain of the second G ( 1 ) D ( 2 ) <ref> [1] </ref>. For an appropriately parameterized set of controllers, U , this relation induces a generally cyclic directed graph. <p> It is the responsibility of the hybrid control system to systematically switch between the individual i in order to achieve the overall task goal. It is this discrete switching of underlying continuous control policies which makes this a "hybrid" control strategy and is discussed in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The flexibility of this approach becomes clear when you consider the behavior taken by such a collection of controllers running under a switching policy such as that in <ref> [1] </ref>, where controllers which are "closer" to the overall goal are opportunistically activated whenever the state of the system enters their domain.
