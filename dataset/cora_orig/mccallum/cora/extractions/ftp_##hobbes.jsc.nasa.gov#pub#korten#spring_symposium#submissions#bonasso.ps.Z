Title: Characterizing an Architecture for Intelligent, Reactive Agents

Abstract: In this paper we briefly describe a software architecture that integrates reactivity and deliberation. The architecture has three levels, or tiers. The bottom tier contains a set of situated, reactive skills. The second tier is a sequencer that can activate sets of skills to perform a task. The third tier is a planner that reasons in-depth about goals, resources and constraints. We characterize this architecture across several dimensions and then describe the lessons that we have learned from applying this architecture to several robotics projects.

Reference-contexts: Having achieved this framework we have begun to investigate the integration of other AI disciplines. Natural language is already being researched at the RAPs level <ref> (Martin & Firby 1991) </ref>. And the architecture could benefit from combining with concurrent perception architectures such as those supporting mapping (Kuipers & Byun 1991; Kortenkamp & Weymouth 1994).
