Abstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) is becoming increasingly important for business, education, and entertainment. Popular web browsers make access to Internet information resources relatively easy for novice users. Simply by clicking on a link, a new page of information replaces the current one on the screen. Unfortunately however, after following a number of links, people can have difficulty remembering where theyve been and navigating links they have followed. As ones collection of web pages grows and as more information of interest populates the web, effective navigation becomes an issue of fundamental importance. We are developing a prototype zooming browser to explore alternative mechanisms for navigating the WWW. Instead of having a single page visible at a time, multiple pages and the links between them are depicted on a large zoomable information surface. Pages are scaled so that the page in focus is clearly readable with connected pages shown at smaller scales to provide context. As a link is followed the new page becomes the focus and existing pages are dynamically repositioned and scaled. Layout changes are animated so that the focus page moves smoothly to the center of the display surface while contextual information provided by linked pages scales down. While our browser supports multiscale representations of existing HTML pages, we have also extended HTML to support multi-scale layout within a page. This extension, Multi-Scale Markup Language (MSML), is at an early stage of development. It currently supports inclusion within a page of variable-sized dynamic objects, graphics, and other interface mechanisms from our underlying Pad++ substrate. This provides sophisticated client-side interactions, permits annotations to be added to pages, and allows page constituents to be used as independent graphical objects. In this paper, we describe our prototype web browser and authoring facilities. We show how simple extensions to HTML can support sophisticated client-side interactions. Finally, we discuss the results of preliminary user-interface testing and evaluation.

Reference-contexts: Suns Hot-Java project uses the Java language [18], Cygnus Supports GNU Remote Operations Web (GROW) proposes to use GNUs Guile extension language [17], and Microsofts Blackbird will use dynamically loadable object files <ref> [6] </ref>. By providing the ability to download and run code locally allows complicated animations, for example, to be encoded in a concise and network efficient manner. The Pad++ WWW browser contains a full Tcl interpreter.

Reference-contexts: This, of course, carries with it enormous security risks that we have not yet addressed. In the future we may restrict ourselves to a safe subset of the language as with Java or GROW. In our case this will initially be SafeTcl <ref> [7] </ref> but may also include support for other languages (e.g. Java). Lenses Pad++ lenses can change the way objects look on the Pad++ surface [2][5][31]. In MSML, they can be particularly useful.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to provide rich annotation facilities by combining Pad++s dynamic multiscale annotation ability with a control system that supports creation of virtual documents in which documents and annotations are separately controlled and maintained. See <ref> [29] </ref> for an example of one such control mechanism. To support effective views of collected web pages it is important to be able to show modifications over time.

Reference-contexts: Another uses scaling to show the history of changes. Older versions are shown at increasingly smaller scale. Marking changes is similar in spirit to efforts conducted by <ref> [35] </ref> using the WebWatch program. Unlike that effort we conjecture that one might not merely want to know that a document has been altered but also the details of the changes. 4. USER TESTING RESULTS In November of 1995, we completed a pilot test of our zooming web browser.
