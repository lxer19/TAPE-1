Reference-contexts: In what follows, you will find: * An introduction to Echo. * Information on how to obtain, install and run the Echo system. * A description of Echo's graphical interface. * Information on running Echo. 1.1 Echo Echo is a model of complex adaptive systems formulated by John Holland <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. It abstracts away virtually all of the physical details of real systems and concentrates on a small set of primitive agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. The extent to which Echo captures the essence of real systems is still largely undetermined. <p> As described here, Echo will refer to the implementation developed at the Santa Fe Institute. Several versions of the system have been developed by Holland, and there are significant differences between these. Echo has been described in <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. These descriptions represent snapshots of ongoing thought about Echo models. The version implemented here is closest to that described in [1]. <p> Several versions of the system have been developed by Holland, and there are significant differences between these.

These are used to determine with whom and how the agent interacts in the world. They are described in detail elsewhere <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. These "genes" can all grow and shrink (even to zero length) under mutation. 4 CREATING A WORLD 17 3.6 The Graphs There is not much to say about the graphs. The individual graphs are briefly described in section 3.2.
