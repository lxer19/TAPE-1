Title: A Quick and Dirty Sketch of a Toy Logic  
Author: J Strother Moore 
Date: April 3, 1998  
Abstract: For the purposes of this paper, a "logic" consists of a syntax, a set of axioms and some rules of inference. We define a simple Lisp-like logic, and then use it to prove a few theorems. This exercise gives us a vehicle for exploring the issues involved in defining a useful logic precisely.

Reference-contexts: The second group, called the "Lisp axioms," introduce the properties of various function symbols. 3.1 Propositional Equality Any classical formalization of propositional calculus and equality will suit our purposes. So that this "toy logic" is self-contained we have included one such formalization, essentially that of Shoenfield <ref> [1] </ref>. Shoenfield formalizes propositional calculus with one axiom schema and four rules of inference. He introduces equality with three axiom schemas. Axiom Schema (the Propositional Axiom). (: _ ) By this we mean every formula of the above form is an axiom. <p> The first five are taken from <ref> [1] </ref> and support propositional calculus and equality reasoning. <p> Having shown how to "get off the ground" using Shoenfield's system, we will henceforth use such propositional rules and results freely. You are free to use such results in your proofs for this class. Readers unfamiliar with propositional calculus are urged to consult a logic textbook, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>. 5.2 Equality We next prove a simple theorem about the equality predicate. We are not so much interested in the theorem as in the proof, because it suggests the proof of the commonly used derived rule of "substitution of equals for equals." Theorem.
