Reference-contexts: If necessary, these letters will have an appropriate subscript. Before introducing the rules in a formal way, let us first describe the underlying ideas on an intuitive level. The rules that handle the usual ALC concept forming operators are well-known and rather straightforward (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). As an example for the treatment of the Boolean operators, assume that there is a world constraint x : C u D jj l in a world constraint system W .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Terminological knowledge representation languages in the style of kl-one <ref> [7] </ref> have been developed as a structured formalism to describe the relevant concepts of a problem domain and the interactions between these concepts. Starting with concept names (unary predicates) and roles (binary predicates), one constructs more complex concepts with the help of operators provided by a given concept language.

Reference-contexts: To avoid these problems, we consider the more general case where arbitrary axioms are allowed. Let us now turn to the semantics of ALC M . The modal operators will be interpreted by a Kripke-style possible worlds semantics <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus, for each dimension i we need a set of possible worlds D i . Modalities of dimension i correspond to accessibility relations 7 on D i , which may, however, depend on the other dimensions as well.

Reference-contexts: Several approaches have been proposed to combine terminological formalisms with notions like time or beliefs. A very simple possibility to represent beliefs of agents is realized in the partition hierarchy SB-PART <ref> [13] </ref>, which is an extension of the sb-one system. In this approach, each agent may have its own set of terminological axioms (TBox ), and these TBoxes can be ordered hierarchically.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the concept language ALC is nothing but a syntactic variant of the propositional multi-modal logic K (m) . Building upon this observation, [24] augments ALC by tense operators. The two approaches that come next to the one we shall introduce below are described in <ref> [15, 16] </ref> and in [19]. Both extend ALC by modal operators, but with different emphasis.

This will also clarify the 4 differences between the formalism presented below and the extensions of terminological languages described in [19] and <ref> [15, 16] </ref>. For simplicity, assume that we are interested in time and belief operators only. Thus, in addition to the objects (like John and Mary) we have time points and belief worlds. <p> In the present paper, we shall not take into account this last aspect, but we shall treat the object dimension in a special way, thus eliminating the problems mentioned above. In <ref> [15, 16] </ref> both aspects are considered. However, modal operators are not allowed to occur inside of concept expressions, which considerably simplifies the algorithmic treatment of the formalism. The difference to [19] is, on the one hand, the special treatment of the object dimension.

For the case where modal operators occur only in front of terminological and 26 assertional axioms, an integration of KD45 modal operators has already been considered in <ref> [16] </ref>. Second, the multi-dimensionality of our language has not really been made us of. In fact, we have seen that with respect to satisfiability there is no difference between the -dimensional and the corresponding 1-dimensional case (Corollary 5.4). We have introduced a multi-dimensional framework since it is more flexible.
