Abstract: We investigate the enumerative aspects of various classes of perfect graphs like cographs, split graphs, trivially perfect graphs and threshold graphs. For subclasses of permutation graphs like cographs and threshold graphs we also determine the number of permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng such that the permutation graph G[] belongs to that class. We establish an interesting bijec-tion between permutations whose permutation graphs are cographs (P 4 -free graphs) and permutations that are obtainable using an output-restricted deque [9] and thereby enumerate such permutations. We also prove that the asymptotic number of permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng whose permutation graphs are split graphs is fi(4 n = p n). We also introduce a new class of graphs called C 5 -split graphs, characterize and enumerate them. C 5 -split graphs form a superclass of split graphs and are not necessarily perfect. All the classes of graphs that we enumerate have a finite family of small forbidden induced subgraphs.

Reference-contexts: For a comprehensive treatment of various classes of perfect graphs, see <ref> [5] </ref>. Two graphs G and H are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertex sets which preserves adjacency. Isomorphism is an equivalence relation and therefore partitions any set of graphs into isomorphism classes. <p> Note if 1 is the inverse of the permutation , G [] ~ = G [ 1 ].

Proof : Follows easily by induction. <p> It is well-known that threshold graphs form a proper subclass of split permutation graphs (see, for instance <ref> [5] </ref>) and we now proceed to determine the asymptotic value of the numbers sp n , where sp n stands for the number of permutations of f1; 2; : : :; ng such that G [] is a split graph. <p> : :; ng such that G [] is a split graph is fi (4 n = p Proof : By lemmas 6.3 and 6.4, 1 n 2n 2 n and hence sp n 2 fi ( 2n p Remark : Threshold graphs form a subclass of split permutation graphs (see <ref> [5] </ref>) and we obtained a closed form expression for the permutation representations of threshold graphs.

Reference-contexts: Clearly by lemma 2.2, g n = 2c n for n 2 and hence we have : G (x) 1 + x = 2C (x) (1) Since G is a cograph iff all connected components of G are cographs, it follows that (see for instance <ref> [7] </ref>) G (x) = Q 1 log G (x) = k=1 k By 1 and 2, we have : 2C (x) x + 1 = exp k=1 k Using lemma 1.1, we get, for n 1, g n = n 1 m=1 X dc d ) and g m = 2c <p> graphs on n vertices is given by: s n = 1 + k=1 n n X k 1 2 (k1)(nk) Proof : Follows from theorem 3.2 since s n = P n 3.2 Non-isomorphic split graphs The symmetry involved in this case necessitates the use of Polya's enumeration theory (see <ref> [7, 12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.2 jU n j = jT n j. Proof : We prove this by establishing a bijection between the two sets. Since G is unambiguous, for each y 2 U n one can associate a unique parse tree P T (y) (see <ref> [8] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Wherever pertinent, we also enumerate permutation representations of a class of graphs (defined later). As a by-product, we also enumerate permutations that can be obtained using an output-restricted deque <ref> [9] </ref> by establishing a bijection between such permutations and P 4 -free permutations (i.e permutations whose permutation graphs are cographs). We also determine the asymptotic value of the number of permutations of f1; 2; : : :; ng whose permutation graphs are split. <p> A permutation is obtainable using an OPD (called OPD-perm) if can be obtained by a sequence of operations comprising of s; q and x performed using the numbers 1; 2; ; n in that order starting with the empty deque (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details). Let d n denote the number of OPD-permutations on f1; 2; ; ng. <p> This gives a simple proof of the fact that D (z) = 1 2 (3z 1 6z + z 2 ). This formula is given a generating function based proof in <ref> [9] </ref>, another (more combinatorial) proof appears in [16], where it is shown, by exhibiting a bijection between OPD-permutations on f1; 2; : : : ; ng and the lattice paths between (0; 0) and (n 1; n 1) that always stay on or below the diagonal with possible steps being (0; <p> This recursive definition has been used to associate a unique parse-tree called a cotree with every cograph G (see [3]). However, since we are interested in P 4 -free permutations, we associate with each P 4 -free permutation of f1; 2; ; ng a unique rooted ordered tree (see <ref> [9] </ref> for definitions) T () such that: i. Every internal node has at least two children. ii. The n leaves of T () are given labels from f1; 2; ; ng in a specific way and correspond to the n vertices of G []. iii. <p> The combined effect of these two is that an admissible string S begins with a q and the number of s's and q's strictly exceed the number of x's in any proper prefix of S. For further details, refer <ref> [9, Section 2.2.1, Ex 10] </ref> or [16]. <p> and then g n and we have: C (x) = x + 2! 4x 3 + 4! 181x 5 + ; 2x 2 + 3! 49x 4 + 5! One can also get an explicit formula for c n in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind (see Knuth <ref> [9, Section 1.2.6] </ref> for definitions). <p> together with C (x) = (1 e x )G (x) = (1 e x )e C (x) implies that C (x) = T (1 e x ) 1 X k k1 (1 e x ) k Now, we have the following formula involving Stirling numbers of the second kind (see <ref> [9, Section 1.2.9] </ref>): (e z 1) n = z n + n + 1 n + 1 X n z k Thus we have C (x) = n=1 X n x n+k (1) k 1 X (1) n x n n X n n o implying c n = (1) n
