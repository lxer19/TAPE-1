Abstract: A new, very simplistic, lossless source code is shown to be universal. With this code, given integers k and L, k &lt;&lt; L, a source sequence of length L is parsed into k-tuples; all distinct k-tuples are placed in a dictionary; the dictionary is encoded; and the index of each source k-tuple in the dictionary is encoded. It is shown in this paper that for any stationary, ergodic source, if k is optimized for the given L (for example, by trial and error), then as L tends to infinity, the rate of this very simplistic code tends to the entropy-rate of the source. Thus the code is universal.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Since universal lossless codes were discovered, a number of coding algorithms have been proposed and shown to be universal. Such codes (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a survey) have the property that for any stationary, ergodic source, their rate approaches the entropy-rate of the source as some parameter, such as blocklength, increases. The goals of such work include finding universal codes that minimize quantities such as redundancy, complexity and blocklength.

Reference-contexts: The desired result (i) follows from (4) and (5). COMMENTS The simplistic code described here does not exploit frequencies of any kind, unlike Lynch-Davisson type codes [2-4] or the code of <ref> [5] </ref>, which exploits a frequency ranking. <p> Like our method, Lempel-Ziv coding does not exploit frequencies. However, it should not be considered simplistic. On the other hand, Willems <ref> [5] </ref> describes a universal code that merely encodes the time to the most recent occurrence of the present k-tuple, up to some limit, which is very simplistic.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for studying the simplistic code of this paper came from our attempts to prove the universality of the hierarchical code in <ref> [7] </ref>, which would appear to be a better code.
