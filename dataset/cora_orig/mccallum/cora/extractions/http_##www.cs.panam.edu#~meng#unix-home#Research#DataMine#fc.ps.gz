Abstract: An increasing number of web-sites require users to establish an account before they can access the information stored on that site ("personalized web browsing"). Typically, the user is required to provide at least a unique username, a secret password and an e-mail address. Establishing accounts at multiple web-sites is a tedious task. A security-and privacy-aware user may have to invent a distinct username and a secure password, both unrelated to his/her identity, for each web-site. The user may also desire mechanisms for anonymous e-mail. Besides the information that the user supplies voluntarily to the web-site, additional information about the user may flow (involuntarily) from the user's site to the web-site, due to the nature of the HTTP protocol and the cookie mechanism. This paper describes the Janus Personalized Web Anonymizer, which makes personalized web browsing simple, secure and anonymous by providing convenient solutions to each of the above problems. Janus serves as an intermediary entity between a user and a web-site. Given a user and a web-site, Janus automatically generates an alias typically a username, a password and an e-mail address that can be used to establish an anonymous account at the web-site. Different aliases are generated for each user, web-site pair; however the same alias is presented whenever a particular user visits a particular web-site. Janus frees the user from the burden of inventing and memorizing distinct usernames and secure passwords for each web-site, and guarantees that an alias (including an e-mail address) does not reveal the true identity of the user. Janus also provides mechanisms to complete an anonymous e-mail exchange from a web-site to a user, and filters the information-flow of the HTTP protocol to preserve user privacy. Thus Janus provides simultaneous user identification and user privacy, as required for anonymous personalized web browsing.

Reference-contexts: To address these requirements, we use a cryptographic function that we define in a companion paper <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref>, to provide for any interaction that is personalized, yet anonymous. This function is called a Janus function. The cryptographic framework and tools developed in [BGGMM97] are only briefly sketched in this paper. <p> To address these requirements, we use a cryptographic function that we define in a companion paper <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref>, to provide for any interaction that is personalized, yet anonymous.

Furthermore, [BGGMM97] introduces a more advanced scheme (with a more complex implementation) for integrating alias e-mail; this scheme reduces the required trust in the intermediary. Finally, note that there are two aspects to anonymity in web browsing: anonymity of data content and anonymity of connection. <p> The construction is taken from <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref>, where a formal specification and a proof that the construction meets these specifications are given. It is also demonstrated there that an attempt for a simpler construction is vulnerable to successful cryptanalytic attacks, and is hence not satisfactory. The Setting of the Janus-function. <p> note that in actual implementations, additional applications of a pseudo-random function can be used to make each S i (almost) as unguessable as the original S: r u r p J u (id; w; S) = h (r u w ) id)) w jj (f S 3 (r p In <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref>, it is proven that the above construction meets the desired specification. 4 Supporting Anonymous E-mail by Janus In this section, we show how the Janus system can be extended to allow web-sites to send e-mail back to users. <p> However, in a configuration where Janus and the intermediary coincide, such as in Fig. 4, this last issue is not a concern. In what follows, we describe an approach which does not violate the property of modular security & protection from dossiers. In <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref>, an alternative approach is shown, which in addition does not require the intermediary to store secret, user-identifying information. To obtain this additional property, the email is not forwarded to the user, but instead stored at the intermediary in anonymous mail-boxes until it is retrieved by the user. Design. <p> Note that the constructions of J and Email are quite similar. Thus, given the proof in <ref> [BGGMM97] </ref> that J satisfies the properties given in Sect. 3, it is a simple exercise to show that adding Email (id; w; )@domain-name to the alias of a user id for web-site w preserves all the properties of the alias username and password given in Sect. 3. 5 Payments Some web-sites

Chaum presented a general framework in which users maintain distinct pseudonyms for different organizations, such that pseudonyms cannot be traced or be related to each other. However, there is no concrete realization of pseudonyms with these properties that is similar to the one considered here.

Reference-contexts: Janus guarantees anonymity of data content; anonymity of connection has been studied in contexts such as anonymous electronic cash and e-mail (see <ref> [GWB97] </ref> for an overview of such work), and we assume these previous techniques can be used to provide anonymity of connection in web browsing. The Janus Personalized Web Anonymizer is currently being implemented. Further details can be found in the Janus home page, http://www.bell-labs.com/ project/janus. Outline of this Paper. <p> Simon in [S96] gives a precise definition for such an Anonymous Exchange Protocol. Research and implementation efforts for such anonymous networks are being carried out by several groups (e.g., <ref> [PW85, SGR97, GWB97] </ref>). of users are located on a trusted Intranet behind a firewall. The Janus proxy is located on the firewall and all web browsing activity on the Internet is going through the Janus proxy.

Reference-contexts: is visiting your site; Record the actual number of people that visit (not plain hits); Find which links they follow and trace their complete path; Learn which site users came from and which site they depart to..." These products are made possible by the fact that the HTTP protocol (see <ref> [HTTP] </ref>), on which the World Wide Web is based, allows specific information to flow back from the user to the web-site. This can include the previous web-site visited by the user, as well as information about the user's software and host-computer.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, once a communication between a user and a web-site has been established, they may use any agreed-upon system that supports anonymous financial transactions. This consideration leads in a natural way to the idea of integrating Janus with a system like JEPI (Joint Electronic Payments Initiative) of the W3C <ref> [JEPI] </ref>; JEPI is planned to be a universal payment platform that will allow merchants and consumers to transact business over the Internet using many different forms of payment, possibly including anonymous payments.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we suggest that the communication between a user and a web-site take place ideally over an Anonymous Communication Network (as depicted in Fig. 1). This kind of a network allows parties to send individual messages to each other and to reply to a received message anonymously.

Reference-contexts: Note that this kind of scenario is even more problematic in today's web browsing without Janus, where the eavesdropper can obtain the real identity and possibly credit card information of the user. The use of SSL (see <ref> [SSL96] </ref>) can offer pro Fig. 4. Janus configuration for a large Intranet tection if there is a direct connection between a user's browser and a web-site.
