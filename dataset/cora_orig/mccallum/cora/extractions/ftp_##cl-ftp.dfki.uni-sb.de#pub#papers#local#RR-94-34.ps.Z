Reference-contexts: General methods of linking competence-based NL core systems to application systems are being developed, including methods for deriving performance-oriented sublanguages [ Uszkoreit et al. 1994 ] and configurable generation components <ref> [ Busemann 1993 ] </ref> that can work with simple techniques, but have available a full linguistic knowledge base as a fall-back. * The decision to allow desired speech acts to be chosen by the application was fundamentally sound, since the application has a better grasp of its own state and may

Reference-contexts: In particular, simultaneous availability of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features was a great asset in implementation of the speech act recognition method of <ref> [ Hinkelman and Allen 1989 ] </ref> . This method takes advantage of both semantic representations and other features to which no formal semantics has been assigned. * New research was stimulated by the necessity of connecting DISCO to such a rigid interface as IR. <p> The new inference-based level receives as input a set of speech act interpretations in propositional form, which are translated into action representations with preconditions and effects. The interpretations found are then filtered for consistency with context, according to the method of <ref> [ Hinkelman and Allen 1989 ] </ref> . Each context contains the beliefs of some individual or group as modelled by the system.

Reference-contexts: The interpretations found are then filtered for consistency with context, according to the method of [ Hinkelman and Allen 1989 ] . Each context contains the beliefs of some individual or group as modelled by the system. Our belief model is fully implemented <ref> [ Hinkelman and Spackman 1994 ] </ref> , and has the unique property of attributing beliefs directly to groups rather than sets of individuals. In particular, the conversational record is also a group belief context.

Reference-contexts: This allows for a highly modular, although strongly interconnected, representation of linguistic knowledge [ Netter 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: Manipulation of NLL expressions and translation into and out of the NLL semantics module are therefore viewed and implemented as tree transformations on the NLL abstract syntax (see presently) that are specified as meta-syntactic rewrite rules over the concrete NLL syntax ( <ref> [ Nerbonne et al. 1993a ] </ref> argue for the parallelism between 9 NLL and traditional compiler technology). The NLL transformations implemented so far in the cosma prototype can be classified according to their theory vs. domain dependence and the target language (NLL vs.

Reference-contexts: NLL is a logical form semantic representation language borrowing from various schools of linguistic semantics (e.g. the generalized quantifier theory and the logic of plurals). It is designed to provide a general-purpose semantics module, thus extending the scope of domain- and application-independent linguistic processing <ref> [ Nerbonne et al. 1993b ] </ref> . In the cosma application NLL was extended to cover the interface between NL semantics and the cosma appointment planner.

Reference-contexts: communication with other agents; (ii) a graphical user interface (GUI) (developed inside project DISCO) monitoring the calendar state and supporting the mouse- and menu-driven arrangement of new appointments; and (iii) the DISCO NL core system (enriched with a set of application specific modules) that provides the natural language capabilities (see <ref> [ Uszkoreit et al. 1994 ] </ref> for an overview over DISCO). In this set-up DISCO is connected to an external application system that comes with a rigid interface, viz. the appointment planner internal representation (IR) language. <p> General methods of linking competence-based NL core systems to application systems are being developed, including methods for deriving performance-oriented sublanguages <ref> [ Uszkoreit et al. 1994 ] </ref> and configurable generation components [ Busemann 1993 ] that can work with simple techniques, but have available a full linguistic knowledge base as a fall-back. * The decision to allow desired speech acts to be chosen by the application was fundamentally sound, since the application

Reference-contexts: The user can select a set-up under which no decision will be made without user confirmation. 1 The same domain is used by the project VerbMobil <ref> [ Wahlster 1993 ] </ref> for the translation of spoken dialogues. 3 * The functionality of the application can be extended in many ways. <p> It also requires general theorem proving and context manipulation facilities. It may be objected that this kind of indirect speech act is of little relevance to application systems. But it will occur in conversations dominated by human beings, such as in the VerbMobil scenario <ref> [ Wahlster 1993 ] </ref> . There are also hosts of smaller problems which can individually be papered over in the lexicon, but will not be addressed with any generality until the lexicon or its inferential partner contains enough information to show the semantic relationships between words.
