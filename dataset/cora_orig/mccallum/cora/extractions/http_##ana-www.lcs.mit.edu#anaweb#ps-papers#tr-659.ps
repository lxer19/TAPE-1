Reference-contexts: As an example, consider the Internet: the traffic related to information manipulation has increased tremendously in the past few years <ref> [1] </ref>. Corresponding to this growth has been an increasing need for tools to manage information, particularly a mechanism to connect and relate knowledge. <p> The notion of connecting and relating knowledge has been a compelling vision since at least 1945 when Vannevar Bush suggested the implementation of a vast knowledge base [6]. These ideas have been further developed in hypertext systems, such as Xanadu [17], Aquanet [16] and World Wide Web <ref> [1] </ref>, where links are utilized to explicitly represent a relationship or association between entities. Hypertext links provide a powerful mechanism to relate information. In the World Wide Web, links provide a means of information navigation. Xanadu utilizes links for quotation, navigation, annotation and commentary. <p> Xanadu links are composed of end-sets and are contained in nodes. Xanadu links maintain associations across document versions and provide a mechanism for determining all links to a particular Xanadu document. 2.3 World Wide Web The World Wide Web <ref> [1] </ref> is perhaps the best known, most widespread and most successful example of a distributed hypertext system. The Web allows navigation via links across the Internet and between documents. <p> We describe the Mesh kernel and Mesh object system. 31 3.1 Goals The Information Age has created a need to manipulate a vast and ever increasing amount of data. As an example, consider the Internet: the traffic related to information manipulation has increased tremendously the past few years <ref> [1] </ref>. Indeed, the explosive growth and success of the World Wide Web, Gopher and other Internet information navigators, combined with the recent commercialization of the Internet, can only lead to increasing growth.

Reference-contexts: Each WWW link specifies a relationship between two entities: the document in which the link is contained, and an identified destination document. WWW documents are specified in HTML [5]. World Wide Web documents are identified through the use of location (a Universal Resource Location or URL <ref> [2] </ref>) rather than in a location independent manner such as Universal Resource Names [21]. 1 This prevents the relocation of Web objects they can not be moved from the location described by their URL. For transmission purposes, WWW document content is specified using Internet Media Types [18].

Reference-contexts: Further, the draft suggests the addition of a CLASS mechanism to subclass HTML elements. 15 WWW link types are specified by a relationship name.

This is particularly frustrating because early WWW documentation <ref> [3] </ref> suggested several link names to describe "relationships between documents" and "relationships about subjects of documents".

Reference-contexts: Links must be contained in one of the two documents they associate. The Web provides a mechanism to allow servers to add links to documents "by those who do not have the right to alter the body of a document <ref> [4] </ref>", but servers are not required to provide this functionality. There are no mechanisms to link two documents if the servers of both documents refuse the additional links. <p> However, the present use of WWW link relationship names is extremely limited.

The notion of connecting and relating knowledge has been a compelling vision since at least 1945 when Vannevar Bush suggested the implementation of a vast knowledge base <ref> [6] </ref>.

Hypertext links provide a powerful mechanism to relate information. <p> It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory <ref> [6] </ref>." Bush's work was distinguishable for its inclusion of an association mechanism: the examination of one item in the system would suggest another. <p> Bush envisioned this mechanism working in a fashion similar to the human brain: "With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain <ref> [6] </ref>." It is largely agreed that one outgrowth of Bush's vision was hypertext, an information management mechanism in which data is stored in nodes connected by links. 2.2 Xanadu Ted Nelson's Xanadu Project [17] is an influential examination of a large hypertext system.

Reference-contexts: The hope is that "much as traditional applications utilize a database system, the Mesh will become the primitive abstraction around which applications are built <ref> [8] </ref>." The overall vision of the Information Mesh Project is to provide a long-lived global architecture for networked-based information reference, manipulation and access as a ubiquitous substrate for distributed and network applications and domain-specific knowledge bases. <p> link mechanism. 56 5.1 Link Attributes Mesh links should be sufficiently flexible to provide the link capabilities described in Chapter 2: * Link utilization Mesh links are the primary mechanism for expressing object relationships in the Mesh. "Links are an inherent part of the Information Mesh, expressing relationships among nodes <ref> [8] </ref>." Mesh links should further be able to describe relationships between other Mesh links. Thus, Mesh links are the fundamental mechanism for expressing relationships in the Information Mesh.

Reference-contexts: This need can be justified by the example of independent links in Aquanet and Dexter and the desire to provide an equivalent mechanism in the Information Mesh. 57 Some Mesh links need to be "bundled" with Mesh objects. This capability is described by an Information Mesh proposal <ref> [9] </ref>: "Links can be either explicit or implicit; an implicit link is one that declares a relationship between objects that is a necessary part of one of the linked objects, while an explicit link represents a relationship that is not inherent to any of the objects it links... <p> An implicit link is likely to reside with the object to which it "belongs," while an explicit link may reside anywhere, and in fact may need to be an object in the sense it can be named with an oid and have further links... <ref> [9] </ref>." Note that in Section 5.2.3 we shall propose an alternative to designating links as either explicit or implicit. * Endpoint capabilities Mesh links may relate an object, some aspect of an object, or some substructure of an object.

Reference-contexts: Dexter does explicitly utilize a particular notion of directionality; Dexter provides directionality as a mechanism to support directionality semantics in existing hypertext systems with Dexter's two-way links. For example, Dexter models a one-way link system (such as HyperCard <ref> [10] </ref>) by using two 21 way links with the source end having a direction value of NONE and the other end having a direction value of TO. 5 * presentation specification is a primitive value that helps the runtime layer determine how the associated descriptor should be presented to the user.

Reference-contexts: Dexter allows duplicate direction values with the constraint that at least one specifier have a direction of TO or BIDIRECT. There are many different notions of directionality. Grtnbaek and Trigg <ref> [11] </ref> have identified at least three types: semantic direction, creation direction and traversal direction. Dexter does explicitly utilize a particular notion of directionality; Dexter provides directionality as a mechanism to support directionality semantics in existing hypertext systems with Dexter's two-way links. <p> This also means that links cannot normally be seen from their destination cards <ref> [11] </ref>." 6 In [25], Penzo, Sola and Vitali propose modifications to Dexter to support dynamic determina tion of anchor ids. 22 "The use of UIDs as a basic addressing mechanism in hypertext may be too re-strictive. <p> Dexter provides only limited motivation for link directionality. Dexter direction-ality is motivated as a mechanism to support directionality semantics in existing hypermedia systems, but, as shown by Grtnback and Trigg, it is insufficient "to model the ways people interpret link direction in practice <ref> [11] </ref>." 2.6 Observations Several observations about the overall characteristics of the previously described hy pertext systems: 1. Scalability is often ignored. Dexter and Xanadu require links and other system information be completely available an unrealistic expectation for distributed systems.

Reference-contexts: In summary, Aquanet utilizes a type hierarchy to describe object types and multi-ended links to provide enhanced knowledge structuring capabilities. 2.5 Dexter The Dexter Hypertext Reference Model provides an abstract model of hypertext systems which describes the entities and mechanisms which allow users to create, manipulate and examine hypertext <ref> [12] </ref>. The overall goal of Dexter is two-fold. First, Dexter formalizes some of the hypertext notions we have examined, thus providing a vocabulary that can be utilized to describe a particular hypertext system's functionality and characteristics. <p> Component information includes: unique identification, anchoring, presentation specification and attribute/value pairs. 18 * Unique Identifier Each Dexter component has a unique identifier (UID) assumed to be "uniquely assigned to components across the entire universe of discourse <ref> [12] </ref>." * Anchors Each Dexter component contains a sequence of anchors that index into the component. Dexter anchors provide an indirect addressing mechanism for specifying the internal structure of a component in a manner which does not depend on knowledge of the internal structure of a document. <p> As a component changes over time, the anchor value changes to reflect modifications to the internal structure of the component, "[t]he anchor id, however, remains constant, providing a fixed referent that can be used to specify a given structure within a component <ref> [12] </ref>." * Presentation Specification The presentation specification is a primitive value containing information about how the node contents should be presented to the user. <p> The attribute/value pairs can "be used to attach any 19 arbitrary property (and its value) to a component. For example, keywords can be attached to a component using multiple `keyword' attributes <ref> [12] </ref>." Note that Dexter does not provide a formal component type model. Some component attributes can be determined by examining attribute-value pairs, but no formal type system mechanism is specified. <p> Some component attributes can be determined by examining attribute-value pairs, but no formal type system mechanism is specified. Some descriptions of Dexter suggest modeling a component type system by "adding to each component a `type' attribute with an appropriate type specification as its value <ref> [12] </ref>." 2.5.3 Dexter Base Components Dexter components are composed of a base component together with the component information described in Section 2.5.2. The base components in the Dexter storage layer are: atomic components, composite components and links. Atomic Components Atomic components are the finest grain members of the storage layer. <p> in which a component is presented to the user can be a function not only of the specific hypertext tool that is doing the presentation (i.e., the specific run-time layer), but can also be a property of the component itself and/or of the access path (link) taken to that component <ref> [12] </ref>." Thus, the runtime layer is the layer at which dynamic mechanism is determined, while the storage and component level mechanisms previously described implement hypertext as an essentially passive data structure. 2.5.6 Dexter System Invariants The Dexter model requires that several invariants be maintained at all times by the hypertext system. <p> Halasz suggests: "The basic hypertext model lacks a composition mechanism, i.e., a way of representing and dealing with groups of nodes and links as unique entities separate from their components [13]." Further, the notion of a composite component is formalized in the Dexter Model of Hypermedia System <ref> [12] </ref> which specifies composite components as a directed graph of components. Thus, composite objects can be justified by the need to provide composite objects at the Mesh level. A further motivation for composite objects is the nature of the Information Mesh itself.

Reference-contexts: We argue that composites can only be achieved by pushing a notion of composites into the Mesh. 4.4.1 Need The motivation for a composite structure has been understood by the hypertext community for quite some time. In his Seven Issues paper <ref> [13] </ref>, F. Halasz suggests: "The basic hypertext model lacks a composition mechanism, i.e., a way of representing and dealing with groups of nodes and links as unique entities separate from their components [13]."

Thus, composite objects can be justified by the need to provide composite objects at the Mesh level. <p> Parts whole Required The part containing the entire object. documentation Required The documentation associated with a given object. 78 Chapter 8 Versioning "Versioning is an important feature in hypermedia systems. A good versioning mechanism will allow users to maintain and manipulate a history of changes to their network <ref> [13] </ref>." 8.1 Versioning Options Versioning options include: * authoritative server This approach uses a server which is guaranteed to contain the latest version. Utilizing an authoritative server requires the availability of the server for any versioning operations.

Reference-contexts: into a multiple inheritance hierarchy. "Aquanet objects of a given type include not only the slots defined by their type but also the slots that they inherit from their supertype (s) [16]." The inheritance rules of the Aquanet type hierarchy are taken directly from the Common Lisp Object System specification <ref> [14] </ref>. Aquanet nodes and links are distinguished by their use of slots. Node slot values are a named set of contents restricted to primitive datatypes such as text, images, numbers, strings, etc. Link slot values may be primitive datatypes or other Aquanet objects. <p> Roles are arranged into an inheritance hierarchy such that if an object plays a particular role, it also plays all of that role's super roles. The inheritance rules for roles are based on the hierarchy rules present in the Common Lisp Object System specification <ref> [14] </ref>. The single root of all role inheritance is the object-role which provides role playing capabilities as described in Section 3.5.1. Roles serve as an extensible object typing mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Since links are also components in the Dexter model, it may be argued that a frame in KMS is actually a composite component <ref> [15] </ref>." Dexter utilizes specifiers to describe the link relationship. The specifier structure contains: a component specification, an anchor id, a direction and a presentation specification. * component specification provides a description of the component being linked.

Reference-contexts: The notion of connecting and relating knowledge has been a compelling vision since at least 1945 when Vannevar Bush suggested the implementation of a vast knowledge base [6]. These ideas have been further developed in hypertext systems, such as Xanadu [17], Aquanet <ref> [16] </ref> and World Wide Web [1], where links are utilized to explicitly represent a relationship or association between entities. Hypertext links provide a powerful mechanism to relate information. In the World Wide Web, links provide a means of information navigation. Xanadu utilizes links for quotation, navigation, annotation and commentary. <p> WWW documents are identified by location, emphasize human browsing and expose internal content for linking through the use of anchors. WWW links are one-way, two-ended, document-based and can become "dangling" links. WWW link types are specified by a relationship name. 2.4 Aquanet Aquanet <ref> [16] </ref> is a hypertext knowledge structuring tool designed to allow users to graphically represent information and explore its structure. Aquanet allows users to interpret and organize ideas using Aquanet's linking structure to connect and express ideas. <p> Type definitions are organized into a multiple inheritance hierarchy. "Aquanet objects of a given type include not only the slots defined by their type but also the slots that they inherit from their supertype (s) <ref> [16] </ref>." The inheritance rules of the Aquanet type hierarchy are taken directly from the Common Lisp Object System specification [14]. Aquanet nodes and links are distinguished by their use of slots. <p> In this section, we examine Dexter in considerable detail. First, we examine 4 The term knowledge structure refers to "..an interconnected network of information-bearing nodes that are used to represent the primitive objects and their interconnection in some domain of discourse <ref> [16] </ref>." 17 the Dexter storage layer which contains components that serve as nodes and links. We separately examine the composite information and base components which together construct all Dexter components. Additionally, we describe Dexter's storage layer functions and runtime layer.

Xanadu documents are the fundamental unit of storage. Indeed, everything in the Xanadu system is a document. Xanadu documents "may contain text, graphics, links... or any combination of these... [17]." Xanadu documents provide no information hiding or abstraction layer; they expose their entire structure and contents, along with associated versioning information, in a manner allowing Xanadu links to relate any portion of a document. Xanadu links are composed of "end-sets". <p> Xanadu links are contained in nodes: "Each link resides in one place, the document that contains it. Links, just like text, are owned. Every link is part of a particular [document] and has an owner <ref> [17] </ref>." Links can relate other links by connecting to the link portion of a document. Xanadu links maintain associations across document versions. "Essentially, the link seizes a point or span (or any other structure) in the [document] and holds onto it. <p> Links may be refractively followed from a point or span in one version to corresponding places in any other version. Thus a link to one version of a [document] is a link to all versions <ref> [17] </ref>." Unfortunately, the mechanism for a link to "hold" onto a node across versions is dependent on specific characters remaining invariant: "a link is attached.... to specific characters and simply stays with these characters wherever they go [17]." Note that this mechanism will break under a variety of conditions, including wording <p> link to one version of a [document] is a link to all versions <ref> [17] </ref>."

"The reader should be able to ask, for a given document, `What connects here from all from other documents?' and be shown all these outside connections without appreciable delay [17]." In summary, Xanadu provides a link mechanism to allow reader exploration of documents. Xanadu documents expose their entire substructure in a manner allowing links to relate any portion of a document. Xanadu links are composed of end-sets and are contained in nodes.

WWW documents emphasize human browsing, and do not explicitly encode semantics. <p> Oids provide a naming scheme that ensures that objects can be uniquely specified throughout the global network. Our current implementation utilizes the kernel's points, but we eventually expect to provide a more general identification mechanism, such as URNs <ref> [21] </ref>. Object behavior is built around the notion of a role. A role is a specification of an abstract behavior and structure, similar to an object class. An object plays a particular role if it behaves in the manner described by that role.

Reference-contexts: information base. 3.2 Constraints The constraints to meet the vision of a Mesh of objects can be summarized as universality, ubiquity, heterogeneity, longevity, evolvability and resiliency. * Universality The Information Mesh vision of "a single model for information identification, location and access as a substrate for distributed system and applications <ref> [22] </ref>." 32 implies that the Mesh must be universal; it must provide agreement on refer- encing objects and do so in a highly scalable manner. * Ubiquity The Information Mesh must support "network-based applications accessing information that is distributed both physically through the net and administra tively across regions of differing <p> that the Mesh must be universal; it must provide agreement on refer- encing objects and do so in a highly scalable manner. * Ubiquity The Information Mesh must support "network-based applications accessing information that is distributed both physically through the net and administra tively across regions of differing management policies <ref> [22] </ref>." * Heterogeneity The Information Mesh should be prepared for changes in communications media, transport protocols and networked-applications.

Reference-contexts: In particular, points contain at most hints about location. The overall kernel is designed to have minimum constraints on data representation and location to provide a flexible information infrastructure. 3.5 Information Mesh Ob ject System The Information Mesh object system <ref> [23] </ref> provides the Mesh with a powerful means to create and utilize Mesh objects the chief feature of which is the capability of objects 35 to play a variety of roles. Roles describe object behavior by specifying actions, parts and makers. <p> Thus, newer applications can have access to old objects via their old roles at the same time that newer applications can access the same information by using newer roles <ref> [23] </ref>. Roles are first class Mesh objects; a role is a Mesh object which describes the actions, parts and makers necessary for an object to play a particular role.

Reference-contexts: minimal agreement, minimal coordination, and flexibility. * Minimum Agreement The need for minimal agreement comes from the pragmatic understanding that "we can not depend on any universal agreement on issues like a best way to find information, the internal structure of information or how information is internally manipulated by programs <ref> [24] </ref>." Thus we must minimize the requirements imposed on Mesh entities. * Minimum Coordination The need for minimum coordination of information flows from the need for resilience and ubiquity. The Mesh needs to be highly scalable with diverse mechanisms to find, represent and manipulate information. <p> Note that the Information Mesh does not directly deal with security and privacy issues except where they affect design decisions. 3.4 Information Mesh Kernel The first step in realizing the Information Mesh Project was the implementation of the Information Mesh kernel <ref> [24] </ref>. The Information Mesh kernel addresses several of the concerns raised by the Project. In particular, the kernel provides information naming, discovery and relocation as a powerful and evolvable component of the Mesh. The Information Mesh kernel's naming is provided through the use of globally unique identifiers described as points.
