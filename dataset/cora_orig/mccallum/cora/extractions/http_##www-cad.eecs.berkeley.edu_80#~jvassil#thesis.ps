Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 Goals This paper presents the application of a top-down, constraint-driven design methodology <ref> [1] </ref> in the design of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) for a video driver system. The video system was chosen as an example to illustrate the value of the top-down methodology for large analog systems. <p> In the top-down design methodology, the system level performance specifications are mapped onto constraints for the behavioral parameters of the high level blocks. The mapping is being done using constrained optimization, where the objective is to maximize a measure of the easiness of the design (flexibility) <ref> [1] </ref>. This process is repeated until the layout level is reached or a module meeting these constraints is found in the library. The goal of the methodology is not the complete automation the design of analog circuits. Such a task is believed to be rather unrealistic. <p> CHAPTER 2. ANALOG PLL DESIGN BACKGROUND 12 13 Chapter 3 Simulation and Optimization Techniques 3.1 The Use of Simulation and Optimization in the Design Methodology In the top-down, constraint-driven design methodology proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, behavioral simulation and optimization play a very important role. Key idea to the methodology is the hierarchical propagation of the top-level specifications to the lower levels of the hierarchy. <p> Following the methodology, since there is an large number of parameter combinations that can meet the specifications, the choice is being done by optimizing for the flexibility <ref> [1] </ref> of the design, which is a measure of the easiness to achieve the design goals. The flexibility functions are typically defined heuristically by the designer. At the highest level of hierarchy, the details of the implementation are not determined yet. <p> An optimization algorithm tolerant to simulator inaccuracies was also implemented. The design was carried out until the layout of the overall system was generated. Bottom-up verification was used to guarantee the system level performance to be within specifications. This work has shown the applicability of the proposed methodology <ref> [1] </ref> in yet more complex systems. Our methodology can help reduce the analog circuit design cycle by making the analog design process more systematic. We plan to fabricate and test the system we have designed to further validate our approach.

Reference-contexts: Such a task is believed to be rather unrealistic. The goal is to help the analog designer to accelerate the design cycle of complex systems, exploiting hierarchy and early verification together with providing him with the necessary tools. Following this methodology analog circuits such as Digital-to-Analog Converters <ref> [2] </ref> and Sigma-Delta Analog-to-Digital Converters [3] have already been designed and manufactured. With this system, the methodology is applied to yet larger systems. In Chapter 2, an overview of the most important PLL design concepts and building blocks is given. <p> Key idea to the methodology is the hierarchical propagation of the top-level specifications to the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, in figure 3.1 the top level DNL, INL specifications of a 10 bit current source interpolative DAC <ref> [2] </ref> are being mapped onto constraints for the behavioral parameters of the building blocks (standard deviation of mismatches and mirror output resistances). <p> SIMULATION AND OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES 21 behavior that circuit performance parameters have, thus discarding useful information about the circuit contained in the gradients.

Reference-contexts: A more quantitative analysis follows. 2.1.1 PLL Linearized Analysis The PLL is a feedback system that exhibits a strong non-linear behavior, especially when the phase difference of the two compared signals is large and the system is trying to null it.

Reference-contexts: Based on the assumption that the phase differences between the pulses are small and the bandwidth of the PLL is much smaller than the input frequency, a continuous time approximation can be done to quantify the behavior of a charge pump PLL <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> However, the true nature of the system is sampled, so a more detailed analysis is needed in order to reveal potential instability problems due to the sampling operation.

Reference-contexts: The most important reason for this is that the numerical noise created by most simulation algorithms can be comparable to the timing jitter. These problems raise the need for an efficient behavioral simulation tool for mixed signal systems. Such a simulator has been developed in <ref> [8] </ref>. The simulator uses behavioral representations described in [9]. Those representations comprise a set of non-linear differential equations solved by an iterative algorithm using a variable step, implicit backward differentiation method. <p> The overall PLL jitter is then predicted by adding random noise at the time of each VCO transition and subsequent statistical analysis of the resulting waveform <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.3 Optimization Method In section 3.1 the use of optimization in the top-down design methodology was explained. Since in most circuit design problems we are dealing with complex nonlinear optimizations, nonlinear methods have to be used.

The simulator uses behavioral representations described in <ref> [9] </ref>. Those representations comprise a set of non-linear differential equations solved by an iterative algorithm using a variable step, implicit backward differentiation method. Key advantage of this algorithm is that it can have a user defined accuracy, thus eliminating the problem of numerical noise. <p> As indicated in <ref> [9] </ref>, such a PFD can be described by a state transition table as in 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Timing jitter as defined in equation 2.10, is modeled by the value of its standard deviation and can be extracted from a circuit using noise simulation techniques described in <ref> [10] </ref> or by using equation 2.14 for differential cell, triode load ring oscillator VCOs. In table 3.3 all the parameters describing the VCO are summarized. CHAPTER 3. <p> First the functionality of the lowest level sub-blocks, such as VCO, dividers, charge-pump, was verified using SPICE and the parameters needed for the higher level blocks were extracted. The timing jitter performance of the VCO was extracted using the non-Monte Carlo, non-linear noise simulator described in <ref> [10] </ref>. Then behavioral simulation was used to verify the performance of the whole system. The extracted parameters of the blocks used in the PLL behavioral simulation are given in table 4.13.

Reference-contexts: There are several methods in the literature dealing with nonlinear optimization, typically gradient methods that use second derivative information of the constraint and objective functions. Such methods are used in nonlinear optimization packets like MINOS <ref> [11] </ref>. The basic idea is to find a local minimum by finding the point where the second derivatives of the functions are zero. Such an approach presents some major disadvantages: * the values of the first and second order derivatives must be very accurate for the method to converge. <p> In the case of the PLL a great problem is eliminated, since the jitter constraint is not defined when the system is unstable. * the linear subproblem can be solved easily and efficiently by employing some linear optimization tool, in this case MINOS <ref> [11] </ref>. * provided that the feasible space is convex, a global optimum is computed instead of some local optimum that other nonlinear optimization methods compute. Those advantages are mitigated by the assumption about the convexity of the problem. In most circuit design problems, convexity cannot be guaranted.
