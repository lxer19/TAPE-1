Abstract: This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning fields. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.

Reference-contexts: This fact can cause circular paths, as well as large fluctuations in measured performance. In addition, adaptive routing can lead more easily to inconsistent situations, associated with node or link failures or local topological changes. These stability and inconsistency problems are more evident for connection-less than for connection-oriented networks <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref>. Another interesting way of looking at routing algorithms is from an optimization perspective. In this case the main paradigms are: * minimal routing versus non-minimal routing; * optimal routing versus shortest path routing. <p> Optimal routing has a network-wide perspective and its objective is to optimize a function of all individual link flows (usually this function is a sum of link costs assigned on the basis of average packet delays) <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref>. Shortest path routing has a source-destination pair perspective: there is no global cost function to optimize. Its objective is to determine the shortest path (minimum cost) between two nodes, where the link costs are computed (statically or adaptively) following some statistical description of the link states. <p> The transmitting node monitors the average packet delay d (queuing and transmission) and the average packet transmission time t over fix observation windows. From these measures, assuming an M/M/1 queueing model <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref>, a link utilization cost measure is calculated as 1 t=d. 334 AntNet: Distributed Stigmergetic Control for Communications Networks sion delay, etc.) over fixed time intervals. Obtained values are rescaled and saturated by a linear function. <p> Appendix A. Optimal and Shortest Path Routing In this appendix, the characteristics of the two most used routing paradigms, optimal and shortest path routing (introduced in Section 2.1) are summarized: 358 AntNet: Distributed Stigmergetic Control for Communications Networks A.1 Optimal routing Optimal routing <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref> has a network-wide perspective and its objective is to optimize a function of all individual link flows. Optimal routing models are also called flow models because they try to optimize the total mean flow on the network. <p> It can be shown that this process converges in finite time to the shortest paths with respect to the used metric if no link cost changes after a given time <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref>. The above briefly described algorithm is known in literature as distributed Bellman-Ford (Bellman, 1958; Ford & Fulkerson, 1962; Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) and it is based on the principles of dynamic programming (Bellman, 1957; Bertsekas, 1995). <p> Each routing information packet is broadcast to all the neighbor nodes that in turn send the packet to their neighbors and so on. A distributed flooding mechanism <ref> (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992) </ref> supervises this information transmission trying to minimize the number of re-transmissions. As in the case of vector-distance, the described algorithm is a general template and a variety of different versions have been implemented to make the algorithm behavior more robust and efficient (Moy, 1998).

Reference-contexts: In this case the main paradigms are: * minimal routing versus non-minimal routing; * optimal routing versus shortest path routing. Minimal routers allow packets to choose only minimal cost paths, while non-minimal algorithms allow choices among all the available paths following some heuristic strategies <ref> (Bolding, Fulgham, & Snyder, 1994) </ref>. Optimal routing has a network-wide perspective and its objective is to optimize a function of all individual link flows (usually this function is a sum of link costs assigned on the basis of average packet delays) (Bertsekas & Gallager, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Several enhanced versions of the basic adaptive Bellman-Ford algorithm can be found in the literature (for example the Merlin-Segall (Merlin & Segall, 1979) and the Extended Bellman-Ford <ref> (Cheng, Riley, Kumar, & Garcia-Luna-Aceves, 1989) </ref> algorithms). They focus mainly on reducing the information dissemination time in case of link failures. When link failures are not a major issue, as in this paper, their behavior is in general equivalent to that of the basic adaptive Bellman-Ford.

Reference-contexts: The sum Q new (d; n) = t n!d + t P k!n is used to compute the variation Q k (d; n) = j (Q new (d; n) Q k (d; n)) of the Q-learning-like value Q k (d; n). PQ-R (adaptive, distance-vector): is the Predictive Q-Routing algorithm <ref> (Choi & Ye-ung, 1996) </ref>, an extension of Q-Routing. In Q-routing the best link (i.e., the one with the lowest Q k (d; n)) is deterministically chosen by packets. <p> It is worth remarking that in these and in some of the experiments presented in the following, PQ-R's performance is slightly worse than that of Q-R. This seems to be in contrast with the results presented by the PQ-R's authors in the article where they introduced PQ-R <ref> (Choi & Yeung, 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: to work with connection-less and not with connection-oriented networks because connection-oriented schemes are mainly used in networks able to deliver Quality of Service (QoS) (Crawley, Nair, Rajagopalan, & Sandick, 1996). 4 In this case, suitable admission control algorithms have to be introduced, taking into account many economic and technological factors <ref> (Sandick & Crawley, 1997) </ref>. But, again, as a first step we think that it is more reasonable to try to check the validity of a routing algorithm by reducing the number of components heavily influencing the network behavior. 4.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation uses the same flooding algorithm, while link costs are assigned over a discrete scale of 20 values by using the ARPANET hop-normalized-delay metric 12 (Khanna & Zinky, 1989) and the the statistical window average method described in <ref> (Shankar, Alaettinoglu, Dussa-Zieger, & Matta, 1992a) </ref>. Link costs are computed as weighted averages between short and long-term real-valued statistics reflecting the delay (e.g., utilization, queueing and/or transmis 12.

Reference-contexts: We report on the behavior of AntNet as compared to some effective static and adaptive state-of-the-art routing algorithms (vector-distance and link-state shortest paths algorithms <ref> (Steenstrup, 1995) </ref>, and recently introduced algorithms based on machine learning techniques). AntNet shows the best performance and the most stable behavior for all the considered situations. In many experiments its superiority is striking. We discuss the results and the main properties of our algorithm, as compared with its competitors. <p> This strategy is based on individual rather than group rationality (Wang & Crowcroft, 1992). Considering the different content stored in each routing table, shortest path algorithms can be further subdivided into two classes called distance-vector and link-state <ref> (Steenstrup, 1995) </ref>. Optimal routing is static (it can be seen as the solution of a multicommodity flow problem) and requires the knowledge of all the traffic characteristics. <p> The algorithm has been implemented following the guidelines of Appendix A, while link costs are assigned in the same way as described for SPF above. Vector-distance Bellman-Ford-like algorithms are today in use mainly for intra-domain routing, because they are used in the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) <ref> (Malkin & Steenstrup, 1995) </ref> supplied with the BSD version of Unix. Several enhanced versions of the basic adaptive Bellman-Ford algorithm can be found in the literature (for example the Merlin-Segall (Merlin & Segall, 1979) and the Extended Bellman-Ford (Cheng, Riley, Kumar, & Garcia-Luna-Aceves, 1989) algorithms). <p> It is the prototype and the ancestor of a wider class of distance-vector algorithms <ref> (Malkin & Steenstrup, 1995) </ref> developed with the aim of reducing the risk of circular loops and of accelerating the convergence in case of rapid changes in link costs. 17. In some cases, only the best estimates are kept at nodes.

Reference-contexts: subsections the above scheme is explained, all its components are ex plicated and discussed, and a more detailed description of the algorithm is given. 324 AntNet: Distributed Stigmergetic Control for Communications Networks 4.1 Algorithm Description and Characteristics AntNet is conveniently described in terms of two sets of homogeneous mobile agents <ref> (Stone & Veloso, 1996) </ref>, called in the following forward and backward ants. Agents 5 in each set possess the same structure, but they are differently situated in the environment; that is, they can sense different inputs and they can produce different, independent outputs.

Reference-contexts: Routing is at the core of the whole network control system. Routing, in conjunction with the admission, flow, and congestion control components, determines the overall network performance in terms of both quality and quantity of delivered service <ref> (Walrand & Varaiya, 1996) </ref>. Routing refers to the distributed activity of building and using routing tables, one for each node in the network, which tell incoming data packets which outgoing link to use to continue their travel towards the destination node.

Reference-contexts: Its objective is to determine the shortest path (minimum cost) between two nodes, where the link costs are computed (statically or adaptively) following some statistical description of the link states. This strategy is based on individual rather than group rationality <ref> (Wang & Crowcroft, 1992) </ref>. Considering the different content stored in each routing table, shortest path algorithms can be further subdivided into two classes called distance-vector and link-state (Steenstrup, 1995). <p> This last aspect is particularly important. Uncontrolled oscillations in the routing tables are one of the main problems in shortest paths routing <ref> (Wang & Crowcroft, 1992) </ref>. It is very important to be able to set the best trade-off between stability and adaptivity. <p> Therefore, optimal routing can be used for static and centralized/decentralized routing. It is evident that this kind of solution suffers all the problems of static routers. A.2 Shortest path routing Shortest path routing <ref> (Wang & Crowcroft, 1992) </ref> has a source-destination pair perspective. As opposed to optimal routing, there is no global cost function to be optimized.
