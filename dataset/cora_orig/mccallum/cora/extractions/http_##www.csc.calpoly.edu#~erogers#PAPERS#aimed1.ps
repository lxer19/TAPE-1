Abstract: The work described in this article presents an approach to the integration of computer-displayed radiological images with cooperative computerized assistance for decision-making. The VIA-RAD system (Visual Interaction Assistant for Radiology) is a blackboard-based architecture, founded on extensive data collection and analysis in the domain of diagnostic radiology, together with cognitive modeling of the interaction between perception and problem-solving. The details of this system are presented in terms of domain knowledge representation and domain knowledge mapping. A small prototype of the system has been implemented and tested with radiology subjects, and the results of this study are also described.

Reference-contexts: Internist-1 [11] had individual diseases as the building blocks for its knowledge base, and first explored the use of a definitional or inheritance hierarchy of diagnostic hypotheses. This approach has also been used in the design of RADIO [6], an expert system for radiological diagnosis. MDX <ref> [1] </ref>, on the other hand, considered the relationship between diseases and findings to be evidential or associational, and this approach was found to be effective in reducing the number of hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: Systems which do address image reasoning issues may be found primarily in domains that contain sensor-derived data (e.g., <ref> [2, 8, 14] </ref>). However, even in these systems, the primary intelligence focuses on symbolic decision-making mechanisms, while the choices of image enhancements are left up to the user.

Reference-contexts: Due to system limitations, the VIA-RAD prototype only contained a small number of image enhancements, including histogram equalization, which is a well-known technique for contrast enhancement [7], and inverse image, which was incorporated in accordance with the results of Coristine et al <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This last piece of information is the mechanism which allows the program to track the user's data-driven (or bottom-up) diagnostic strategy. 2.2 Findings In the problem-solving literature (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), it is typical for observations of the real world to be considered as data that link up directly with solution hypotheses in the form of triggers or cues. However, in the task of looking at sensor-derived images of the real world, there is uncertainty even at the observation level. <p> Hypothetico-deduction is a strategy well-known in the literature of medical diagnosis (e.g., [10]) which is used to generate hypotheses from a set of input data. The use of abductive inference (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>) to converge on a parsimonious set of diagnoses leads to further strategies for managing hypotheses once they have been generated. One such strategy is to try to rule out hypotheses by seeking evidence that differentiates between the choices.

Reference-contexts: These symbolic structures represent how working memory may be organized to accommodate the information flow during the task of diagnostic radiology, and it has been shown that the model accounts for empirical results found both in our own data, and in those of Lesgold et al <ref> [9] </ref>. In the third stage of the project, the model was used as the foundation for the design of a knowledge-based computer system called VIA (Visual Interaction Assistant).

Reference-contexts: Researchers such as Patil have described different levels of hypotheses used by physicians to do diagnosis [15].

Reference-contexts: Another strategy is to emphasize the gathering of evidence because there is insufficient information to generate or strongly support a set of candidate hypotheses. The four diagnostic strategies which Mutalik et al <ref> [12] </ref> identified in their expert critiquing system for aiding radiological diagnosis form the basis for VIA-RAD's collection of strategies: Pursue, Rule-In-Rule-Out, Not-Enough-Information and Conflict.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the VIA system has a somewhat looser control mechanism than is common for typical blackboard systems. Unlike systems which perform 10 automatic reasoning, based on streams of input data (e.g., HASP/SIAP, Tricero, Crysalis <ref> [13] </ref>), VIA depends, to a great extent, on the user for input, particularly of a perceptual kind. The user's actions can only be interpreted in terms of how well VIA can fit them into the underlying model of visual interaction. <p> These relationships are shown in Fig. 6, in a form adapted from the Hearsay-II literature <ref> [13] </ref>. In the initial implementation, a simple agenda control mechanism has been adopted where the preconditions of the appropriate knowledge sources are matched to the blackboard panel most recently modified by the user.

Reference-contexts: The first stage began with an examination of how radiologists read and 2 interpret chest x-ray images through a number of experiments which culminated in the collection of a number of think-aloud protocols <ref> [17] </ref>. An encoding scheme was developed which separated the medical concepts from the more general cognitive and descriptive concepts, and this was applied to all of the verbal protocols. A detailed decomposition of the data was obtained, which was further analyzed to reveal meaningful contextual patterns [18].

A detailed decomposition of the data was obtained, which was further analyzed to reveal meaningful contextual patterns <ref> [18] </ref>. This analysis provided some insights about the task of radiological diagnosis, both in terms of the type of information used, and also how that information is used. Three levels of errors were identified, and several data-driven and expectation-driven reasoning patterns were discerned.

Reference-contexts: Further results included support for both declarative and procedural context, identification of two particular types of attentional activity (immediate visual capture and deliberate landmark search), and an increased understanding of the role of expectation <ref> [19] </ref>. All of these empirical results were then used to develop a cognitively-consistent model of the interaction between perception and problem-solving, shown in Fig. 1 [20]. <p> A detailed discussion of some relevant work on image enhancements and its impact on the development of a cooperative diagnostic radiological assistant is presented in <ref> [19] </ref>. Due to system limitations, the VIA-RAD prototype only contained a small number of image enhancements, including histogram equalization, which is a well-known technique for contrast enhancement [7], and inverse image, which was incorporated in accordance with the results of Coristine et al [3].

Reference-contexts: All of these empirical results were then used to develop a cognitively-consistent model of the interaction between perception and problem-solving, shown in Fig. 1 <ref> [20] </ref>. The central idea behind this model is that the information utilized in this type of visual reasoning task is transformed in a number of ways, and that there is a mediating process between perception and problem-solving, called the Visual Interaction Process (VIP), which enables such transformations.

Belief management in the VIA-RAD system must incorporate a number of aspects, including the user's confidence in the triggering finding, evoking strength of the triggering finding, frequency of the diagnosis, and the user's belief in the diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: This approach has major drawbacks in a clinical setting. Early work by Tuddenham on x-ray diagnosis presented a rather pessimistic outlook on the efficacy of image enhancements to improve diagnostic performance <ref> [24] </ref>. However, more recent research suggests that there are a number of techniques now available which do positively impact radiological diagnostic performance to some extent, especially with respect to detection tasks.
