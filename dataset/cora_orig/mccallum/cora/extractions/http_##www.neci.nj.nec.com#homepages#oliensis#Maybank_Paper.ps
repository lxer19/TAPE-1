Reference-contexts: If q 2 = q 1 = 0 and q 0 6= 0, then is an exponential function, possibly with a complex exponent. If Q 0, then is linear. Further information about the various solutions to (49) is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. Proposition 6. Let f have a zero in [0; 1), and let a &gt; 0 be the least such zero. Let f be bounded on [0; a]. <p> Then f is a ratio, f = 1 d=dx where is a solution of d 2 The solutions of (55) are known as Airy functions <ref> [1] </ref>. There are two linearly independent Airy functions Ai, Bi with contrasting behaviours at large x &gt; 0. <p> If q 2 6= 0, then after rescaling x, t and applying a constant translation to the x coor dinate it suffices to consider the two cases d 2 4 d 2 4 The solutions to (57) or (58) are known as parabolic cylinder functions <ref> [1] </ref>. The solutions to (58) are oscillatory if a &lt; 0. If a 0, then the solutions to (58) are oscillatory for jxj &gt; 2 a. Thus (58) does not yield velocities f that are non-zero in [0; 1).

Reference-contexts: In the one dimensional case M is just a scalar, M = fi. A potential can always be defined by Z x 1 fix 2 (41) and (37) reduces to a Riccati equation <ref> [3] </ref>, f 2 + dx 4 Benes Trajectories in One Dimension The advantage of the Benes filter over the Kalman-Bucy filter is that it can be applied to a wider range of dynamical systems. <p> It is well known <ref> [3] </ref> that any solution to the Riccati equation (42) is of the form f = 1 d (48) where is a solution of the linear ODE d 2 It follows from (48) and (49) that f is real analytic in any region not including the zeros of or the poles of <p> Thus the trajectory G reaches N in a finite time t 0 and G is strictly monotonically increasing for 0 t t 0 . The result follows. 2 Propositions 6 and 7 are special cases of more general results for the Riccati equation <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.2 A special case The case Q (x) q 0 can be resolved completely by elementary integration. After the appropriate rescalings of space and time, it is sufficient to consider the three cases q 0 = 0; 1. Proposition 8.

Reference-contexts: However, there do exist non-linear systems which are finite dimensional in that the conditional density for the system state depends on only a finite number of sufficient statistics. Finite dimensional systems are discussed in [6,7]. The first non-linear examples were found by Benes <ref> [4] </ref>. In the Benes filters the evolution of the sufficient statistics over time is governed by a finite set of first order, ordinary differential equations, which can be solved recursively. <p> In the applications of Theorem 1 made below h is a linear function of x, and is constant; ~ is then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in IR n (OU n process). In the next theorem the representation (15) of t is rewritten. The proof follows <ref> [4] </ref>, except for the way in which the auxiliary function h is used. Theorem 2. <p> The finite dimensional filters are important because they are computationally tractable. In x3.2 it is shown how the representation (18) of the unnor malised conditional density leads to class of finite dimensional, optimal filters, the Benes filters. The results extend those of <ref> [4] </ref> to cases in which the drift velocity of the system state differs by a linear function from the gradient of a scalar potential. The construction of the Benes filter depends in part on the properties of bridge processes, as summarised in x3.1. <p> Equation (33) and hence (31) follow on calculating E (L (t; a!x t )). 2 3.3 Special cases The original definition of the Benes filter, as given in <ref> [4] </ref>, excludes the Kalman-Bucy filters in which the drift is not a symmetric function of x. The more general methods developed in x3.2 allow the extension of the class of Benes filters to include all the Kalman-Bucy filters. <p> These systems were first described by Benes in <ref> [4] </ref>. The class of Benes systems is extended to include certain non-linear systems in which the drift velocity is a linear function plus the gradient of a scalar potential. The Benes filter is closely related to the Kalman-Bucy filter.

Reference-contexts: Equation (11) is known as the Kallianpur-Striebel formula. A proof of it is given in [20]. It is observed in <ref> [14] </ref> that (11) is a version of Bayes' rule. Let (t; x) 7!

The Benes filter is closely related to the Kalman-Bucy filter. It is shown in <ref> [14, section 5.2] </ref> that the state space can be reparameterised such that the Benes filter is reduced to the Kalman-Bucy filter.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the new method is more accurate because it uses a direct approximation to the path integral representation of t . It is thus easier to control the errors arising in the approximation. A full description is given in <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section a numerical example is given in which the new method is applied to a simple non-linear estimation problem taken from computer vision. The results are compared with those obtained using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). <p> The new filter appears to perform better when the evolution of the system state becomes strongly non-linear. The full development of this new approach to non-linear filtering is given in <ref> [15] </ref>.
