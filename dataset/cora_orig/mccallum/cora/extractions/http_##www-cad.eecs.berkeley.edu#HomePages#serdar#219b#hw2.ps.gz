Abstract: 2. Unate Recursive Paradigm and Complementation When we use the unate recursive paradigm to complement a function f , we split around binate variables until we reach leaves that are unate covers. We then apply unate complementation (as explained in the Unate Complementation Theorem) to each leaf. (a) Prove that the cover for the complement of a unate leaf obtained in this manner is unate. (b) Argue that this cover is minimum. We then need to combine the results from the leaves to obtain a cover for the complement at the top of our recursion tree. (c) Prove that f = x(f x ) + x(f x ). Note that this result leads to a merging procedure. (d) Use the unate recursive paradigm to complement f = ab 0 c 0 + ab 0 d + b 0 cd + a 0 cd + bcd + abc + ab 0 cd 0 using the merging procedure inferred from part (c). Show results of your work at each step. Contrast this with what you would have to do if you used DeMorgan's Law for complementation. Let us now look at more sophisticated merging procedures. Given a function g, let H 0 = fc 1 ; : : : ; c l g and H 1 = fd 1 ; : : :; d k g be covers for g x 0 and g x respectively.
