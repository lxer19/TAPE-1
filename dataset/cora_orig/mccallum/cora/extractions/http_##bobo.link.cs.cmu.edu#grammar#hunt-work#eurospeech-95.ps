Title: SYNTACTIC INFLUENCE ON PROSODIC PHRASING IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LINK GRAMMAR

Abstract: This paper presents a new theory of the influence of syntax upon prosodic phrasing. Unlike previous theories which have used constituent tree structures in the analysis of syntax, this theory utilises the syntactic framework provided by either the Link Grammar or a Dependency Grammar. The use of the different syntactic framework leads to other important differences; the role of syntactic function is more important than that of syntactic structure, the relationship between syntax and prosodic phrasing is more direct, and the syntactic influence operates primarily from left to right. The paper presents evidence in support of the theory from experimental tests on two professionally read speech corpora; these tests show that the theory has significant predictive capability and is also effective in resolving syntactic ambiguities.

Reference-contexts: The new theory presented in this paper is similar to Steedman's in one sense: it proposes that a more parsimonious model of the relationship between prosodic phrasing and syntax can be obtained by using an appropriate syntactic representation. For the current work, the Link Grammar <ref> [14] </ref> is used, though the theory is also applicable to a Dependency Grammar [15] because of the similarity in their syntactic representations. The remainder of the introduction provides brief descriptions of the link grammar and break indices (which label prosodic phrasing). <p> Section 2 introduces the theory of prosodic phrasing based on the link grammar. Section 3 describes the results of empirical tests of the theory on two corpora of professionally read speech. 1.1. Link Grammar The link grammar <ref> [14] </ref> is based on the observation that most sentences of most natural languages have the property that arcs drawn to join syntactically related words do not cross. The syntactic analysis of the link grammar is presented as a link diagram. Figure 1 shows an example of a link diagram.

Reference-contexts: The SSynRels can be considered as discrete linguistic units like phonemes or morphemes. Melcuk and Pertsov <ref> [16] </ref> proposed a dependency grammar for English with approximately 40 SSynRels. Around 45 different link labels were used in the parsing of the two corpora used in this work. 1.2. Break Indices The prosodic phrasing of an utterance can be labelled with break indices [17].

Reference-contexts: Melcuk and Pertsov [16] proposed a dependency grammar for English with approximately 40 SSynRels. Around 45 different link labels were used in the parsing of the two corpora used in this work. 1.2. Break Indices The prosodic phrasing of an utterance can be labelled with break indices <ref> [17] </ref>. A break index is marked at each word boundary and indicates the strength of prosodic coupling between adjoining words. <p> Break indices have been incorporated in the ToBI [18] prosodic transcription system. For the current work the earlier seven level break index system <ref> [17] </ref> was used. The numbers below the sentence in Figure 1 are break indices for one reading of the sentence. 2. <p> This should apply even if the syntactic structures are identical. 3. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION The four hypotheses were tested on two professionally read speech corpora with substantially different syntactic content; the Ambiguous Sentence Corpus <ref> [17] </ref> and the Boston University Radio News Corpus [20]. Both corpora were available with hand-labelled break indices using the seven level break index scale [17]. 3.1. <p> EMPIRICAL EVALUATION The four hypotheses were tested on two professionally read speech corpora with substantially different syntactic content; the Ambiguous Sentence Corpus <ref> [17] </ref> and the Boston University Radio News Corpus [20]. Both corpora were available with hand-labelled break indices using the seven level break index scale [17]. 3.1. Hypothesis 1 As a test of hypothesis 1, a single feature representing the most immediate SSynRel at each word boundary was used to predict break indices. <p> Given a set of hand-labelled break indices for an utterance and two competing (ambiguous) syntactic representations of the utterance, the model had to determine the syntactic representation intended by the speaker. The model correctly resolved ambiguities for 87% of utterances. This compares well with human capabilities (84%, <ref> [17] </ref>), and is significantly above the performance of a comparable previous model (80%, [24]). This result provides direct support for hypothesis 4 as the disambiguation method used in the recognition model is based directly on differences in prediction of break indices. 3.4.

Reference-contexts: A low break index (0 or 1) represents tight prosodic coupling, and a large break index (3 or 4) represents weaker prosodic coupling (for example, when a long pause is present between words). Break indices have been incorporated in the ToBI <ref> [18] </ref> prosodic transcription system. For the current work the earlier seven level break index system [17] was used. The numbers below the sentence in Figure 1 are break indices for one reading of the sentence. 2. <p> The predictive accuracy is, however, somewhat below human labelling consistency of break indices (with the five level ToBI break index scale) which shows 70% exact agreement and 93% agreement plus or minus one break index <ref> [18] </ref>. The mean break index for a SSynRel is an empirical estimate of the hypothesised intrinsic prosodic coupling strength.

CONCLUSION This paper has outlined a theory of prosodic phrasing based on the link grammar with substantial differences from previous theories. The experimental results presented in this paper show that there is strong evidence for the four hypotheses that constitute the theory.

Reference-contexts: There is some evidence that this variation is, in part, conditioned by the direction of syntactic depen dency. 3.3. Hypothesis 4 Results for a recognition model based on the theory and using hand-labelled break indices have been presented previously <ref> [23] </ref>. The recognition model estimated the distribution of break indices for each SSyn-Rel by the mean and standard deviation of break indices in a training corpus (the radio news corpus). The model was tested by its ability to resolve syntactic ambiguities in the ambiguous sentence corpus.
