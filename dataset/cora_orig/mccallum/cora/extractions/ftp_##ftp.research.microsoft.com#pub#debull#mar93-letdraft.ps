Reference-contexts: When the user schedules a run, a proxy uses a description of the application to automatically transform experimental attributes held in the database into textual inputs appropriate for a given application. If necessary, the input files are transferred to the computer on which that application is to run <ref> [CMR93] </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates the computational proxy encapsulation of syntactic detail of different programs and computer types. ./garch.dbeng.eps Computational proxies aid in interfacing standalone, heterogeneous applications to a common database, simplifying the computing environment for domain scientists and masking syntactic differences among scientific applications.

Reference-contexts: Because of the complex structure of protein molecules, attempts to use relational DBMS's have not been totally successful. Jointly with Columbia University and Brookhaven National Laboratories, we are developing an object-oriented toolbox for PDB that will use modern software engineering principles and object-oriented DBMS technology <ref> [PSO + 92] </ref>. The toolbox consists of software instruments to access the contents of PDB and will have the reliability, performance, usability, and extensibility of modern computer software.

Reference-contexts: We also developed a query translator from an object level query (which refers directly to the objects in the EER model) to SQL (so far only SYBASE was targeted) <ref> [7] </ref>. In addition, we have developed graphical editors for specifying the database structure and for specifying queries at the object level. These tools have been used by projects at LBL and are used at over 30 institutions in various countries. <p> An interim system was developed using the current tools, and a future system will use the object level query translator mentioned above <ref> [7] </ref>. A second project using these tools is the SSCL magnet laboratory mainly for developing object level schemas and for generating Sybase database definitions. Two additional projects currently pursued are concerned with managing massive amounts of data on tertiary storage. <p> P., Sequence Modeling and an Extensible Object Data Model for Genomic Databases, Ph.D. thesis, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Technical Report LBL-31935, December 1991.

Reference-contexts: Our current and planned work with several scientific applications is described below. There are two aspects of the Human Genome project that we are involved in at this time. The first is a Chromosome Information System (CIS), which uses the EER model to describe the application <ref> [8] </ref>. The object structure definition (schema) is fairly complex, and contains about 35 objects. We have used database tools developed at LBL to translate this object structure definition into a relational database definition. <p> Markowitz and A.

Reference-contexts: The LIMS databases developed using these tools will allow scientists to specify and query the databases in terms of protocols and objects, and will be easily adaptable to protocol changes. The LIMS database tools are based on a data model called the Object-Protocol Model (OPM) developed at LBL <ref> [9] </ref>. OPM provides constructs for directly modeling object and protocol structures specific to LIMS databases. Since protocols often involve a series of steps which are also protocols, OPM supports the specification (expansion) of protocols in terms of alternative and sequences of component (sub) protocols. <p> Markowitz, S.

Reference-contexts: Current database management systems (both Relational and Object-Oriented) interface only to disks. Thus, the management of tertiary storage through a standard interface will be beneficial to both projects. One project is in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Illinois <ref> [10] </ref>. Its purpose is to develop efficient access to high energy "event" data (data that results from collider experiments). The second project is in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Its purpose is to develop efficient access to massive amounts of spatial and temporal data. <p> Lewis, J. McCarthy, F. Olken, and M.

Reference-contexts: We also developed a query translator from an object level query (which refers directly to the objects in the EER model) to SQL (so far only SYBASE was targeted) <ref> [7] </ref>. In addition, we have developed graphical editors for specifying the database structure and for specifying queries at the object level. These tools have been used by projects at LBL and are used at over 30 institutions in various countries. <p> An interim system was developed using the current tools, and a future system will use the object level query translator mentioned above <ref> [7] </ref>. A second project using these tools is the SSCL magnet laboratory mainly for developing object level schemas and for generating Sybase database definitions. Two additional projects currently pursued are concerned with managing massive amounts of data on tertiary storage. <p> P., Sequence Modeling and an Extensible Object Data Model for Genomic Databases, Ph.D. thesis, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Technical Report LBL-31935, December 1991.

Reference-contexts: Our current and planned work with several scientific applications is described below. There are two aspects of the Human Genome project that we are involved in at this time. The first is a Chromosome Information System (CIS), which uses the EER model to describe the application <ref> [8] </ref>. The object structure definition (schema) is fairly complex, and contains about 35 objects. We have used database tools developed at LBL to translate this object structure definition into a relational database definition. <p> Markowitz and A.

Reference-contexts: The LIMS databases developed using these tools will allow scientists to specify and query the databases in terms of protocols and objects, and will be easily adaptable to protocol changes. The LIMS database tools are based on a data model called the Object-Protocol Model (OPM) developed at LBL <ref> [9] </ref>. OPM provides constructs for directly modeling object and protocol structures specific to LIMS databases. Since protocols often involve a series of steps which are also protocols, OPM supports the specification (expansion) of protocols in terms of alternative and sequences of component (sub) protocols. <p> Markowitz, S.

Thus, the management of tertiary storage through a standard interface will be beneficial to both projects. One project is in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Illinois <ref> [10] </ref>. Its purpose is to develop efficient access to high energy "event" data (data that results from collider experiments). The second project is in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
