Abstract: Computational simulation of physical systems generally requires human experts to set up a simulation, run it, evaluate the quality of the simulation output, and repeatedly invoke the simulator with modified input until a satisfactory output quality is achieved. This reliance on human experts makes use of simulators by other programs difficult and unreliable, though invocation of simulators by other programs is critical for important tasks such as automated engineering design optimization. I present a framework for constructing intelligent controllers for computational simulators which can automatically detect a wide variety of problems which lead to low-quality simulation output, using a set of evaluation methods based on knowledge of physics and numerical analysis stored in a data/knowledge base of models and simulations. I describe an experimental implementation of this framework in an intelligent automated controller for a widely used computational fluid dynamics simulator.

Reference-contexts: controllers for numerical simulators are described in [ Gelsey 1991, Gelsey 1994, Sacks 1991, Yip 1991, Zhao 1991 ] , but these only control numerical simulators for ordinary differential equations and do not address the issue of quality assurance. "Intelligent front ends" for computational fluid dynamics simulator are described in <ref> [ Jambunathan et al. 1991, Andrews 1988 ] </ref> . The goal of these front ends is typically to reduce the burden on human users rather than to allow simulators to be run with complete autonomy, so automated quality assurance has not received much attention.

Reference-contexts: If the convergence rate of the numerical algorithm is known or can be estimated more precisely, a tighter bound for the error can be found <ref> [ Dahlquist and Bjorck 1974 ] </ref> . Available information about truncation error convergence rates for numerical algorithms should be stored in the model base (Figure 2). The model base should in addition hold information about input requirements for numerical algorithms. <p> Of course, the precision of the floating point arithmetic must be taken into account: with quadruple precision, a condition number as high as 10 20 would still allow 10 digits of accuracy in the result. <ref> [ Dahlquist and Bjorck 1974 ] </ref> An additional use for the condition number is to compare it to condition numbers from similar simulations stored in the model base.

Reference-contexts: Forbus and Falkenhainer [1990] discuss the use of qualitative simulation to check the quality of numerical simulation results; however, the approach described appears limited to physical situations modeled by ordinary differential equations. Intelligent monitoring for complex systems has received considerable attention (e.g., <ref> [ Dvorak and Kuipers 1991 ] </ref> ), but this work has focused on diagnosis of problems in dynamically changing physical systems 20 as opposed to problems in the execution of computational algorithms which are attempting to simulate the behavior of physical systems.

Reference-contexts: For example, by introducing the assumption of an incompressible, inviscid, irrotational fluid, the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow may be simplified to the more tractable equations of potential flow <ref> [ Newman 1977 ] </ref> . However, no real fluid will ever satisfy these assumptions perfectly. Nevertheless, effects of deviations from these assumptions are frequently small enough to be neglected, so potential flow is often a very useful model. 3.
