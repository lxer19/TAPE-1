Abstract: This paper proposes a solution to the frame problem for knowledge-producing actions. An example of a knowledge-producing action is a sense operation performed by a robot to determine whether or not there is an object of a particular shape within its grasp. The work is an extension of Reiter's solution to the frame problem for ordinary actions and Moore's work on knowledge and action. The properties of our specification are that knowledge-producing actions do not affect fluents other than the knowledge fluent, and actions that are not knowledge-producing only affect the knowledge fluent as appropriate. In addition, memory emerges as a side-effect: if something is known in a certain situation, it remains known at successor situations, unless something relevant has changed. Also, it will be shown that a form of regression examined by Reiter for reducing reasoning about future situations to reasoning about the initial situation now also applies to knowledge-producing actions.

To incorporate knowledge-producing actions like these into the situation calculus, it is necessary to treat knowledge as a fluent that can be affected by actions. This is precisely the approach taken by Moore [ 1980 ] .

Reference-contexts: This has the desirable effect of allowing us to reduce reasoning about knowledge and action to reasoning about knowledge in the initial situation, where techniques such as those discussed in <ref> [ Frisch and Scherl, 1991; Scherl, 1992 ] </ref> can be used. Finally, we show that if certain useful properties of knowledge (such as positive introspection) are specified to hold in the initial state, they will continue to hold automatically at all successor situations. <p> It would be much more efficient to use a method designed for performing automated deduction in modal logics, but sentence 11 has no such representation in a modal logic of knowledge 7 . 7 In fact, the results reported in <ref> [ Frisch and Scherl, 1991; Scherl, 1992 ] </ref> indicate that even modal deduction methods that can be understood as reasoning with the K literals representing the accessibility relation, cannot be easily modified to handle a sentence like 11. 17 Here, regression operators are utilized to address the projection problem. <p> The result of the regression is a formula in ordinary modal logic|i.e. a formula without action terms and where the only situation term is S 0 . Then an ordinary modal theorem proving method (e.g. that developed in <ref> [ Frisch and Scherl, 1991; Scherl, 1992 ] </ref> ) may be used to determine whether or not the regressed formula holds. In what follows, it is assumed that the formulas do not use the fluent K except as abbreviated by Knows.

The task is to show that after an agent performs a litmus paper test on an acidic solution, the agent will know that the solution is acidic. The litmus paper turns red if and only if the solution is acidic.

Reference-contexts: In the next to the last section, we consider regression for the situation calculus with knowledge-producing actions. Finally, future work is discussed in the last section. 2 The Situation Calculus and the Frame Prob lem The situation calculus (following the presentation in <ref> [ Reiter, 1991 ] </ref> ) is a first-order language for representing dynamically changing worlds in which all of the changes are the result of named actions performed by some agent. Terms are used to represent states of the world-i.e. situations. <p> The frame problem arises because the number of these frame axioms in the general case is 2 fi A fi F, where A is the number of actions and F is the number of fluents. The solution to the frame problem <ref> [ Reiter, 1991; Pednault, 1989; Schu-bert, 1990 ] </ref> rests on a completeness assumption. This assumption is that axioms 3 and 4 characterize all the conditions under which action a can lead to a fluent F 's becoming true (respectively, false) in the successor situation. <p> Regression is also used to determine whether or not the sequence of actions ff 1 ; . . . ; ff n is an executable sequence of actions resulting in a legal situation. 8.1 Regression Reiter <ref> [ Reiter, 1991 ] </ref> develops a form of regression to reduce reasoning about future situations to reasoning about the initial situation. In this section, a regression operator is developed for knowledge-producing actions and applied to the problem of determining whether or not a particular plan satisfies a particular property. <p> The regression operator R is defined relative to a set of successor state axioms fi. The first four parts of the definition of the regression operator R fi concern ordinary (i.e. not knowledge-producing) actions <ref> [ Reiter, 1991; Pednault, 1989 ] </ref> . i. When A is a non-fluent atom, including equality atoms, and atoms with the predicate symbol Poss, or when A is a fluent atom or Knows operator, whose situation argument is the situation constant S 0 , R fi [A] = A. ii.

Reference-contexts: the relation at all reachable situations will also satisfy those properties and our model of knowledge will remain S4, without danger of conflicting with the successor state axiom. 8 Reasoning Given the representation of actions and their effects, we would like to have a method for addressing the projection problem <ref> [ Reiter, 1992 ] </ref> .
