Abstract: Distribution of packetized digital speech across high-speed LANs has become increasingly feasible, and packet voice protocols supporting audio conferencing are available. These protocols must provide mechanisms to address errors and delay introduced by the network that threaten the quality of the voice playback at the receiving site. A common mechanism for ensuring continuous voice playback in the presence of delay jitter is the use of a control time for the first packet in each talkspurt. Packet loss is generally not recovered in packet voice protocols, though techniques such as forward-error correction (FEC) and priority channels can be used to reduce losses. In this paper we propose a new error control mechanism for packet voice, referred to as Slack ARQ (S-ARQ). S-ARQ is based on extending the control time for the first packet in each talkspurt to allow for the timely retransmission of lost packets. S-ARQ is orthogonal to the use of preventive error control schemes such as FEC or priority channels. It does not require hardware support, imposes little overhead on network resources, and could be easily integrated into extant voice protocols. Experiments using a simulation model developed in this paper indicate that the extended control time required for S-ARQ can be modestly larger than the control time for jitter control and within the limits imposed by end-to-end delay requirements. The feasibility of the S-ARQ scheme is thus established.

Reference-contexts: Forward-error correction (FEC) allows limited error recovery without retransmission. By sending redundant information with the original information, lost data can be reconstructed using the redundant information. However, FEC results in an increase of required network bandwidth. In <ref> [3] </ref> it was shown that the negative effects of added congestion on a network due to FEC overhead can more than offset the benefits of FEC recovery. Also, FEC requires hardware support at end-systems in order to encode and decode the redundant information with sufficient speed.

Reference-contexts: Using packet-switched networks for these services has become increasingly attractive due to technology trends that have enabled high-speed multiservice networks (e.g., FDDI, DQDB, and ATM) and that have increased the viability of distributed multimedia applications on desktop platforms. Since voice and video are inherently variable rate sources <ref> [4, 17] </ref>, the statistical multiplexing of packets in a packet-switched network represents a more efficient use of network resources than circuit switching. Statistical multiplexing, however, causes delay variation, referred to as delay jitter, and losses due to buffer contention. <p> Note however, that the the control time cannot be arbitrarily large due to constraints on the end-to-end delay (see Table 1). Since voice data consists of an alternating series of talkspurts and silence periods and since talkspurts are generally isolated from each other by relatively long silence periods <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, voice protocols typically impose the control time on the first packet of each talkspurt.

Reference-contexts: Since the frame size in broadcast LANs can be large, a network voice packet is typically carried in a single physical frame. Given a fixed packetization interval, the encoding/decoding scheme determines the actual number of bits per packet. The ubiquitous pulse code modulation (PCM) encoding scheme for voice <ref> [6] </ref> samples every 125 s with 8 bits per sample to yield a 64 kbit/s channel.

Reference-contexts: Packet voice over satellite channels and mobile radio was experimented with in the early 1980's [10, 18, 23].

With the advent of high-speed LANs and powerful desktop computers with audio hardware support, protocols and conferencing tools have become available for multiple-party connections in a local area environment. Examples include NVP, the vat protocol [12], and the NEVOT audio conferencing tool [21]. <p> Bandwidth reduction can be achieved through the use of one or more of the following: fewer bits per sample, less frequent sampling, suppression of transmissions during silence periods (digital speech interpolation), and compression of the digitized data. Adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) <ref> [7] </ref>, for example, is a widely accepted coding technique in which only the differences between consecutive samples are encoded, reducing the number of bits per sample to 2 5. Coding techniques with very low bit rates such as Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) exist, though speech fidelity is frequently poor [14].

Reference-contexts: The selection of a voice encoding scheme represents a trade-off between consumption of bandwidth on the network and the ability to reconstruct natural sounding speech at the receiving side. End-to-end delays have a significant impact on the quality of interactive voice transmissions, as shown in Table 1 <ref> [24] </ref>. Variation in the network delay experienced by individual packets, i.e., delay jitter, can lead to interruptions of the continuous playback of the voice stream at the receiver (voice clipping). Unlike data transmission, packet voice does not need reliable delivery, but its tolerance for packet loss is low.
