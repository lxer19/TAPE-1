Title: How to Create and Animate a Dancing Dinosaur with Implicit Surfaces  
Author: Agata Opalach

Abstract: In this short paper we present a case study of creating a character using implicit surfaces and developing an animation sequence which brings it to life. We show some problems specific to implicit surfaces and discuss solutions we used to deal with them. Basic knowledge of animation techniques and implicit surfaces terminology is assumed.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 presents a sketched storyboard which we used for our animation. In the storyboard we can see the dino-dance movements performed by the character in each frame. Step 3.2 Keyframes In our system [4] we use Eshkol and Wachmann dance notation <ref> [1] </ref> to specify keyframes for an articulated figure. For a dancing dinosaur, we had to extend the notation to include the tail and the neck movements. Eshkol and Wachmann dance notation specifies dance positions as local transformations of limbs.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Over the years traditional animators have developed a wide range of tricks, hints and rules to create better illusion of life with their drawings [5]. Lasseter <ref> [2] </ref> shows how these principles can be successfully applied to computer generated character animation. He created a memorable character, Luxo Jr., a young anglepoise lamp. In our project, we wanted to achieve a similarly entertaining effect using implicit surfaces.

Reference-contexts: However, if we require a real dinosaur, we have to manually refine each limb. Figure 3a shows the dinosaur after modelling the bone/muscle layer for each limb, looking not much different from a real monster. Step 2.2 Modelling esh In our system <ref> [3, 4] </ref> the esh layer is used to model soft and oppy parts of a character, e.g. hair or loose skin. Their motion is not explicitly specified but generated from the motion of the bone/muscle layer. <p> Figure 5 shows a few frames of the resulting animation. 4 Step 3.3 Flesh motion In our system <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, esh motion is automatically generated for the given motion of the bone/muscle layer. Each esh primitive is attached to a limb by a damped spring. Flesh primitives interact with each other according to Lennard-Jones attractive/repulsion forces.
