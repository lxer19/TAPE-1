Title: Using the Larch Prover to Derive Relationships for Cubical Complexes  
Author: by: Robert Ellis 
Date: June 27, 1996  
Note: for: CS6104, Symbolic Computation date:  
Abstract: The Larch Prover is a symbolic logic system for axiomatizing and proving theorems and investigating rewrite systems in general (e.g., term and string rewriting systems). To be investigated in this project are the proofs of to important inequalities in the study of cubical complexes which lie in cubes. A modularized proof is presented in Larch which encodes the relations necessary to prove the inequalities and gives the symbolic flow of the proof.

Reference-contexts: Then @RS r R@S r : Essentially, the boundary operator @ can be moved past the replacement operator R, as long as set inclusion is maintained in the reduction. The proof of this theorem appears in [3] (a corrected version appears in <ref> [1] </ref>). 3.2 f -Vectors of Cubical Complexes The f -vector of a cubical complex encodes in a tuple the number of faces of each dimension in the complex. Of significant interest in the study of cubical complexes is the complete characterization of the f -vectors of all legal cubical complexes. <p> The characterization question is still open for arbitrary cubical complexes, but it has been solved for cubical complexes which lie in cubes or binary lattices (the characterization appears in [2] and is extended in <ref> [1] </ref>). The crucial inclusion above is the main theorem needed for the characterization; in particular, there are two inequalities that follow as a corollary of the crucial inclusion. The inequalities are of a more computational nature, and lead more directly to the proof of the characterization.
