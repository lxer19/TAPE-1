Reference-contexts: This was done by setting a camera a known distance from the truck, then fitting circles to a picture of the cut log ends using the Hough Transform <ref> [1] </ref>. The segmentation of logs on a truck is not as difficult as the segmentation of trees in a forest since the forest adds a confusing background, making isolating the target difficult.

Reference-contexts: Laser/Camera Hybrid Finally, hybrids use various combinations of lasers and imaging. One method employs a spot laser, which returns the range to one specific point, boresighted with a camera to take an image of the scene. This method is similar to commercial products that exist to aid in surveying <ref> [2] </ref>. These products combine a rie scope with a spot laser where diameter estimation is done by measuring range to the target with the spot laser then requiring the user to measure angular size by looking through the scope and finding the tree.

Reference-contexts: The derivation and justification for this metric is outside the scope of this paper, but the following gives a good tutorial on the subject <ref> [3] </ref>. Now that methods of measuring and comparing texture have been chosen, the algorithm which uses these two calculations to segment an image may be described. 10 2.2. Texture Segmentation Algorithm This section will describe the image segmentation algorithm created to split a captured image into target tree and background.

Reference-contexts: This method and has been successfully applied to the segmentation of naturally occurring textures, and is a candidate for use here. Finally, statistical methods, such as the co-occurrence matrix proposed by Haralick et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, extract microtextures such as local gray levels pairs to determine the texture of a region. This method has been widely used and can be applied to random textures. <p> The Co-occurrence Matrix The co-occurrence matrix can be described as "a matrix conveniently representing the occurrences of pairs of gray levels of pixels, that are separated by a certain distance and lie in a certain direction (angle) in an image." <ref> [4] </ref> Given an image I with m different gray levels, two pixels, i 1 and i 2 in I can be represented by: where x is the row location, y is the column location, and i is the gray value of the pixel. <p> This is repeated for every relevant pixel pair. The co-occurrence matrix itself may be used as a measure of texture, or statistics based on the co-occurrence matrix may be computed to give a scalar texture measurement. Haralick et. al <ref> [4] </ref> proposed 10 such statistics, such as entropy, correlation, energy, contrast, and homogeneity which are computed from the co-occurrence matrix as shown in Figure 5. For a more detailed explanation of the co-occurrence matrix please see the following references [4][8]. 2.1.3.

Reference-contexts: In a forest, texture may be a better segmentation basis since color is fairly constant from tree to tree of the same species while texture changes significantly. In general, image textures can be broken into three categories, periodic, nearly periodic or random <ref> [5] </ref>. Periodic textures, such as a crystalline lattice from electron microscopy, have a regular, completely deterministic pattern. Nearly periodic textures, such as the stitches in a sweater, are close to being periodic, but have added noise.

Reference-contexts: Spectral methods such as the short-term fourier transform (STFT) or 2D power spectrum analysis measure the localized frequency content of an image. This method is particularly well suited, and is typically used for, the segmentation of images containing planar, periodic textures <ref> [9] </ref>. Since most naturally occurring natural textures are random and not periodic, this method may not be the best choice.

Reference-contexts: The white line shows the result of the segmentation algorithm. Results due to Mark Ollis 6 this application. 2.1.1. Texture Measurement In general, texture measurement can be broken into five categories: spectral, multiscale, model based, structural and statistical methods <ref> [10] </ref>. Spectral methods such as the short-term fourier transform (STFT) or 2D power spectrum analysis measure the localized frequency content of an image. This method is particularly well suited, and is typically used for, the segmentation of images containing planar, periodic textures [9].

Reference-contexts: To do this, a color image was taken of a field, and a best fit step function was computed for each image scan line using the fisher linear discriminant in RGB space <ref> [11] </ref>. Figure 3 shows the results obtained in a field using this method as well as the line found between compacted and uncompacted garbage using texture as a discriminant instead of color. <p> Another solution, presented by Ollis and Stentz, is a method of shadow removal by using information from a color camera to compensate for the difference in spectral power distribution between light illuminating the shadowed and unshadowed regions <ref> [11] </ref>. It is possible that this method could be applied here.

Reference-contexts: Again, this method is typically used for the segmentation of periodic or nearly periodic textures. Rubner and Tomasi have successfully applied this method to random textures <ref> [12] </ref>, but their method unfortunately discards boundary areas as containing insufficient texture for segmentation. Since boundary areas are the ultimate goal of this segmentation, this method is again not the best candidate.

Reference-contexts: This method has been successfully used in the segmentation of natural scenes, but common problems with this approach are the time and number of texture samples required for model creation <ref> [13] </ref>. This method is a possible choice since it has been proven to work with natural textures, however, the complexity and speed of the computation must be taken into account as negative factors.

This method is a possible choice since it has been proven to work with natural textures, however, the complexity and speed of the computation must be taken into account as negative factors. Structural methods, such as the texton model proposed by Voorhees and Poggio [13], extract texture primitives or macrotextures, such as blobs of similar color or shape, from an image. The density and other first order properties like width or length may then be used to group similar looking regions.
