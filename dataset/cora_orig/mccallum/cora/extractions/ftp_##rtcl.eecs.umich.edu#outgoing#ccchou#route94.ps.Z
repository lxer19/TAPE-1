Abstract: To guarantee the delivery of real-time messages before their deadline, a real-time channel or connection must be established before the transmission of any real-time messages. During this channel establishment phase, one must first select a route between the source and destination of this channel and then reserve sufficient resources along this route so that the worst-case end-to-end delay over the selected route may not exceed the user-specified delay bound. We propose an efficient distributed route selection scheme that is guaranteed to find a "qualified" route, if any, satisfying the performance requirement of the requested channel without compromising any of the existing guarantees. The proposed scheme can also eliminate the common reliability/performance bottleneck of a centralized route selection scheme, while improving efficiency over the centralized and other distributed schemes. Although the proposed solution starts with searching all possible routes in parallel , it prunes infeasible routes quickly and its worst-case operational overhead is shown to be only a linear function of the number of links in the network. Several examples and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed route-selection scheme. The work described in this paper was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-J-92-1080 and the National Science Foundation under Grant MIP-9203895.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The increasing demand of real-time network services has generated considerable interest in the development of real-time communication protocols. The concept of "real-time channel" proposed by Ferrari and Verma <ref> [8] </ref> is one of the most notable solutions to the problem of meeting message/packet 1 delivery deadlines in wide-area point-to-point networks. <p> A real-time channel is a unidirectional virtual circuit which, once established, is guaranteed to meet user-specified performance requirements as long as the user does not violate his a priori specified traffic-generation characteristics <ref> [8] </ref>. Generally, two distinct phases are required to realize the concept of real-time channel: off-line channel establishment and run-time message scheduling. <p> Although several channel-establishment schemes have been proposed in the literature <ref> [3-5, 8, 10, 11, 15] </ref>, very few of them have addressed explicitly the issue of selecting a route between the source and destination of a channel, despite its importance to the channel-establishment phase.
