Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Log-periodic oscillations in scaling systems preceding the critical point have been observed in several systems. Probably the first theoretical suggestion of their relevance to physics has been put forward by Novikov <ref> [1] </ref> to describe the influence of intermittency in turbulent flows. Preliminary experiments [2] seem to observe these oscillations on the time-dependent rate of convergence of structure functions. The interest in log-periodic oscillations has been somewhat revived after the introduction of the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena.

Reference-contexts: The interest in log-periodic oscillations has been somewhat revived after the introduction of the renormalization group theory of critical phenomena. The mathematical existence of such corrections has been discussed quite early in renormalization group solutions for the statistical mechanics of critical phase transitions <ref> [3] </ref> . However, these log-periodic oscillations, which amount to consider complex critical exponents, were rejected for translationally invariant systems, on the basis that a period implies the existence of one or several characteristic scales, which is forbidden in these ergodic systems in the critical regime. <p> The mathematical existence of such corrections have been identified quite early <ref> [3] </ref> in RG solutions for the statistical mechanics of critical phase transitions, but have been rejected for translationally invariant systems, since a period (even in a logarithmic scale) implies the existence of one or several characteristic scales, which is forbidden in these ergodic systems in the critical regime.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the Feigenbaum/Coullet-Tresser sequence of subharmonic bifurcations to chaos can be understood from an asymptotically exact discrete renormalization group with a universal scaling factor, therefore leading to complex exponents and log-periodic oscillations around the main scaling as the dynamics converges to the invariant Cantor set measure at criticality <ref> [4] </ref> . Discrete scale invariance and complex exponents have also been discovered in dynamical stochastic processed in homogeneous systems when there exists a sufficiently strong intermittency, such as in models of diffusion in anisotropic quenched random media [5] .

It has been found that, for boolean delay equations involving two time lags with an irrational ratio, the cumulative number of jumps J presents a superdiffuse behavior Log-Periodic Scaling 2 with log-periodic oscillations [6] . We will focus first on rupture in very heterogeneous media (including earthquake) of the existence of log-periodic scaling on the approach to major breakdown point. Then we will present several applications as well as simulations in support of the log-periodic scalings.

Reference-contexts: What is the nature of rupture associated with earthquake? An important working hypothesis, borrowed from Statistical Physics, is that earthquakes are similar to "critical" points: a progressive correlation develops leading to a cascade of events at increasingly large scales culminating in a larger earthquakes <ref> [7] </ref> . Failure in the crust can be thought of as a scaling-up process in which failure at one scale is part of the damage accumulation pattern at a larger scale. If a great earthquake can be viewed as a critical point, precursors of earthquakes should follow characteristic scaling laws.

Reference-contexts: However, the above results do not justify that stock market crashes can be predicted exactly ahead of the time. Feigenbaum <ref> [15] </ref> argued that, a crash can occur over a day (e.g. the 1987 crash), or over months (e.g., the 1967 crash), and thus the precise relationship between the critical time t f involved in a log-periodic fit and the time of the crash requires further study.
