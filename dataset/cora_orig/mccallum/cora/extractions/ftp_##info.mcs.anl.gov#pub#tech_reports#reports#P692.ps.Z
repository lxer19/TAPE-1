Abstract: Two nonsymmetric search directions for semidefinite programming, the XZ and ZX search directions, are proposed. They are derived from a nonsymmetric formulation of the semidefinite programming problem. The XZ direction corresponds to the direct linearization of the central path equation XZ = I; while the ZX direction corresponds to ZX = I. The XZ and ZX directions are well defined if both X and Z are positive definite matrices, where X may be nonsymmetric. We present an algorithm using the XZ and ZX directions alternately following the Mehrotra predictor-corrector framework. Numerical results show that the XZ/ZX algorithm is, in most cases, faster than the XZ+ZX method of Alizadeh, Overton, and Haeberly (AHO) while achieving similar accuracy. fl Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA.

Reference-contexts: In order to ensure the symmetry of the iterates X k and Z k generated by interior-point methods, symmetric reformulations of central path equation (1.4) have been developed. Alizadeh, Haeberly, and Overton <ref> [1] </ref> considered instead of (1.4) the symmetric equation XZ + ZX = 2I: (1.5) Zhang [11] proposed a generalized symmetrization of the form 1 [P 1 XZP + (P 1 XZP ) T ] = I; (1.6) where P can be any nonsingular matrix. <p> Recently, Monteiro and Tsuchiya [5] considered the symmetric central path equations Z 1=2 XZ 1=2 = I; X 1=2 ZX 1=2 = I: (1.7) Linearization of the above symmetric central path equations leads to different search directions. The most commonly used directions are the XZ+ZX or AHO direction <ref> [1] </ref>, the HKM direction [2, 3, 4], and the NT direction [7], obtained from (1.6) by taking P equal to I, Z 1=2 , and [Z 1=2 (Z 1=2 XZ 1=2 ) 1=2 Z 1=2 ] 1=2 respectively. <p> 2 S n + : (1.9) The XZ search direction (X; y; Z) is defined as the solution of the following linear system: XZ + XZ = oeI XZ; (1.10a) m X y i A i + Z = C i=1 3 where = X * Z=n, and oe 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a centering parameter. Thus, the XZ direction can be viewed as the result of the direct linearization of the central path equation XZ = I.

We note that the third term in (3.5) cannot be neglected because sometimes it may contribute significantly to the complexity, especially when extra matrix factorizations are used. We also note that the computation of the XZ direction needs the least number of matrix factorizations.

Remark 3.5 The computation of the ZX direction is similar to that of the XZ direction.
