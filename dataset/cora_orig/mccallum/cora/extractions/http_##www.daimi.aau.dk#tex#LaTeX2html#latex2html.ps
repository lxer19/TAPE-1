Abstract: Where the terms `version 96.2' or `V96.2' are used, we actually mean this revision f.) Abstract L A T E X2HTML is a conversion tool that allows documents written in L A T E X to become part of the World-Wide Web. In addition, it offers an easy migration path towards authoring complex hyper-media documents using familiar word-processing concepts. L A T E X2HTML replicates the basic structure of a L A T E X document as a set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references, citations, footnotes, the table-of-contents and the lists of figures and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting information which has equivalent "tags" in HTML (lists, quotes, paragraph-breaks, type-styles, etc.) is also converted appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final HTML document. L A T E X2HTML extends L A T E X by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw HTML commands. These hyper-media extensions to L A T E X are available as new commands and environments from within a L A T E X document. This document presents the main features of L A T E X2HTML and describes how to
