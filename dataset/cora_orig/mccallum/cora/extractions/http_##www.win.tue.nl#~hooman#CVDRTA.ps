Abstract: A distributed real-time arbitration protocol is specified and verified using an asser-tional method. The formalism is based on classical Hoare triples which have been extended to deal with real-time properties. To verify design steps, a compositional proof system has been formulated for these extended triples. The intention of the protocol is to resolve contention between a number of concurrent modules that compete to acquire control of a common bus. Therefore our proof method has been adapted to deal with concurrent processes that communicate by means of a common bus. Compositionality makes it possible to verify the required properties of the protocol using only the specifications of the modules. Next we give a top-down derivation of a program implementing a module according to its real-time specification.

Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands During the past decade a large number of formal methods have been devised to specify and verify real-time systems, see for instance [2]. The main aim of this paper is not to introduce yet another formalism, but to investigate the application of an existing formal framework to a small but realistic example. The formalism is only adapted as far as it is required by this example. We consider a distributed real-time arbitration protocol in which a number of distributed components asynchronously execute a certain algorithm. A well-known verification problem is that the number of possible states of such a system is exponential in the number of components. To deal with this state explosion problem we have chosen to use an assertional method in which a set of states can be characterized by a single logical formula. Further, to reduce the complexity of the verification task, we use a method which is compositional, that is, which allows reasoning with the specifications of components rather than their implementation. Observing the nice compositional rules for sequential composition and iteration of classical Hoare triples (precondition, program, postcondition), we have modified these triples to obtain a formalism for the specification and the verification of distributed real-time systems. The assertion language, in which pre- and postcondition are expressed, has been extended with primitives denoting the timing of actions. Since in classical Hoare triples the postcondition only has to hold for terminating computations, they are restricted to the verification of safety properties. Our aim is to specify and verify progress properties of both terminating and nonterminating computations. Therefore we have adapted the interpretation of triples. To indi-1.
