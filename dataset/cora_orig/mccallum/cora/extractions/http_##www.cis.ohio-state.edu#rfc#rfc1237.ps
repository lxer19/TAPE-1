Title: Network Working Group  Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet Status of  
Author: Richard Colella (NIST)

Abstract: This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the IAB Official Protocol Standards for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract The Internet is moving towards a multi-protocol environment that includes OSI. To support OSI in the Internet, an OSI lower layers infrastructure is required. This infrastructure comprises the connectionless network protocol (CLNP) and supporting routing protocols. Also required as part of this infrastructure are guidelines for network service access point (NSAP) address assignment. This paper provides guidelines for allocating NSAPs in the Internet. This document provides our current best judgment for the allocation of NSAP addresses in the Internet. This is intended to guide initial deployment of OSI 8473 (Connectionless Network Layer Protocol) in the Internet, as well as to solicit comments. It is expected that these guidelines may be further refined and this document updated as a result of experience gained during this initial deployment.

Subsequent to an upcoming ANSI X3 Committee ballot, the dpANS will be distributed for public comment.

It is reasonable to expect that final text for the intra-domain IS-IS standard will be available by mid-1991. There are two candidate proposals which address OSI inter-domain routing, ECMA TR/50 <ref> [3] </ref> and Border Router Protocol (BRP) [19], a direct derivative of the IETF Border Gateway Protocol [18]. ECMA TR/50 has been proposed as base text in the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6/WG2 committee, which is responsible for the Network layer of the ISO Reference Model [11].

Reference-contexts: ES-IS, international standard ISO9542 [13] approved in 1987, is available in vendor products and is planned for the next release of Berkeley UNIX (UNIX is a trademark of AT&T). It is also cited in GOSIP Version 2 <ref> [4] </ref>, which became effective in April 1991 for all applicable federal procurements, and mandatory beginning eighteen months later in 1992.

NIST has delegated the authority to register AA identifiers for GOSIP Version 2 NSAPs to the General Services Administration (GSA). Addendum 2 to ISO8348 allows a maximum length of 20 octets for the NSAP.

Reference-contexts: A Administration of NSAPs NSAPs represent the endpoints of communication through the Network Layer and must be globally unique <ref> [5] </ref>. Addendum 2 to ISO8348 defines the semantics of the NSAP and the abstract syntaxes in Colella, Gardner, & Callon [Page 30] RFC 1237 Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet July 1991 which the semantics of the Network address can be expressed [14].

Reference-contexts: As illustrated in Figure 1, ISO addresses are subdivided into the Initial Domain Part (IDP) and the Domain Specific Part (DSP), as specified in ISO8348/Addendum 2, the OSI network layer addressing standard [14] (also RFC 941 <ref> [6] </ref>). The IDP is the part which is standardized by ISO, and specifies the format and authority responsible for assigning the rest of the address.

Reference-contexts: This paper assumes that CLNP will be widely deployed in the Internet, and that the routing of CLNP traffic will normally be based on the OSI ES-IS (end-system to intermediate system) routing protocol applicable for point-to-point links and LANs [13] (see also RFC 995 <ref> [7] </ref>) and the emerging intra-domain IS-IS protocol [17]. Also expected is the deployment of an inter-domain routing protocol similar to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [18]. The guidelines provided in this paper are intended for immediate deployment as CLNP is made available in the Internet.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Internet is moving towards a multi-protocol environment that includes OSI. To support OSI in the Internet, an OSI lower layers infrastructure is required. This infrastructure comprises the connectionless network protocol (CLNP) [12] (see also RFC 994 <ref> [8] </ref>) and supporting routing protocols. Also required as part of this infrastructure are guidelines for network service access point (NSAP) address assignment. This paper provides guidelines for allocating NSAPs in the Internet (NSAP and NSAP address are used interchangeably throughout this paper in referring to NSAP addresses).

For OSI networks in the U.S., portions of the ICD subdomain are available for use through the U.S. <p> Referring to Figure 4, when the value of the AFI is 39, the IDI denotes an ISO DCC and the abstract syntax of the DSP is binary octets. The value of the IDI for the U.S. is 840, the three-digit numeric code for the United States under ISO3166 <ref> [9] </ref>. The numeric form of organization name is analogous to the Administrative Authority identifier in the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP.

The NSAP consists of the initial domain part (IDP) and the domain specific part (DSP). The initial domain part of the NSAP consists of an authority and format identifier (AFI) and an initial domain identifier (IDI).

Reference-contexts: An example of a physical address is a 48-bit MAC address; a logical address is merely a number that meets the uniqueness requirements for the System Identifier field, but bears no relationship to an address on a physical subnetwork. * The network address itself contains no routing information <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is necessary to find a balance between these two needs. Routing data abstraction occurs at the boundary between hierarchically arranged topological routing structures. An element lower in the hierarchy reports summary routing information to its parent (s). Within the current OSI routing framework <ref> [16] </ref> and routing protocols, the lowest boundary at which this can occur is the boundary between an area and the level 2 subdomain within a DIS10589 routing domain.

See <ref> [17] </ref>, Clause 7.2.11 and Table 2 of Clause 7.5.1). Level 2 routing is based upon address prefixes. Level 2 ISs distribute, throughout the level 2 subdomain, the area addresses of the level 1 areas to which they are attached (and any manually configured reachable address prefixes). <p> Note that two octets have been reserved to accommodate future growth and to provide additional flexibility for inter-domain routing. The last seven octets of the GOSIP NSAP format are structured in accordance with DIS10589 <ref> [17] </ref>, the intra-domain IS-IS routing protocol. The DSP Format Identifier (DFI) identifies the format of the remaining DSP structure and may be used in the future to identify additional DSP formats; the value 80h in the DFI identifies the GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure.
