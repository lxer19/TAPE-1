Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of connectivity of portables to an ATM wired network in the in-building environment. The approach to the support of ATM reduces the mobility load on the wired ATM network and is compatible with standard signalling protocols. The system is pico-cellular with a large number of base stations. The base stations are designed to be deployed in large numbers each covering a short range with partially overlapping coverages. This increases the aggregate throughput and reduces some of the problems specific to a radio physical layer. The MAC layer is optimised to provide efficient use of bandwidth and support guarantees for ATM traffic classes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking is advocated as a key technology for the provision of scalable, high performance networking for telecommunications, the local area, and even the home <ref> [1] </ref>. ATM, unlike competing technologies, provides true support for multiservice traffic through its ability to give Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to individual connections.

Reference-contexts: These difficulties are mainly due to multi-path effects and high attenuation caused by the cluttered environment. Multi-path effects are caused by the interference of multiple reflected rays from a source as they arrive at a receiver. Multi-path causes inter-symbol interference and fading. RMS delay spread <ref> [8] </ref> is a good measure of the multi-path dispersion and [9] shows that there is correspondence between the receive and transmit antenna separation, or pico-cell size, and the RMS delay spread.

Reference-contexts: The choice of radio cell size has a significant impact on some of the general aspects of the system. A smaller cell size, improves frequency re-use and hence aggregate throughput, at the expense of the number of base stations and the frequency at which handover occurs <ref> [11] </ref>. Increasing the throughput using frequency reuse rather than increasing the bit-rate of each mobile reduces the cost because each physical interface can be much simpler.

Reference-contexts: These are not easily achieved in a mobile environment. 2.6 Quality of Service Management As defined by the ATM Forum there are four traffic classes CBR, VBR, ABR and UBR <ref> [12] </ref>. One of the main attractions of ATM is its ability to give QoS guarantees to these different traffic classes, based on traffic parameters such as cell loss ratio, cell delay and cell delay variation. <p> The ATM routing protocols are not used to manage the dynamic section of the connections, as this is handled by the dedicated mobile software infrastructure. 3.2.1 Large Scale Mobility In the current ATM standards, as defined by the ATM Forum <ref> [12] </ref>, ATM addresses are organised hierarchically, where the hierarchical nature of the address is used for wide-area routing. Therefore, a single fixed address cannot be used to route connections to a mobile as it moves between domains.

Reference-contexts: We can therefore decouple the small scale routing between the FSP and the BSP from the PNNI <ref> [13, 14] </ref> protocols used in the private ATM network between switches. When a mobile is registered, or on mobile handover, a virtual path is established between the FSP and the BSP. Connection requests destined for the mobile are routed via this virtual path to the BSP. <p> The decision is made based on the resources in each switching element in turn, although routing takes into account the distribution of resources in other parts of the network <ref> [13] </ref>. Although these mechanisms concern the traffic patterns flowing on an ATM link, each is concerned with processes which happen on very different time scales from the medium access control. In the MAC architecture there is interaction between the call admission control and the allocation of bandwidth to CBR.

Reference-contexts: This is so that, on handover of a mobile, the FSP can independently re-create the virtual circuits for the mobile. There are likely to be a number of VCs active to a mobile end-point at any time. For example in a multi-media system, such as the ORL Medusa system <ref> [15] </ref>, there are typically a number of control streams which do not necessarily have strict QoS requirements combined with a number of real-time or continuous media streams. Using the virtual path mechanism, virtual circuits can be controlled collectively with reference only to the VP. <p> The tile has an ATMos ATM processor card, a framestore, and an LCD display with pen input. A number of tiles are deployed on the wired network, as part of the Medusa project <ref> [15] </ref>. The tile acts as a remote frame buffer which displays an X session relayed from virtual frame buffer running on a workstation on the wired network. TCP connections between the tile and the workstation are used to transmit screen updates, pen movements and button events.

Reference-contexts: Multiplexing and demultiplexing of handover signalling for different mobiles is handled efficiently by making use of separate VCIs. 3.3.3 RPC Between Management Entities The RPC mechanism is based on a CORBA architecture <ref> [18] </ref> and is used to provide machine independence for the location of management entities. CORBA is a standard platform for the development of higher layer distributed systems implementations of which are available for workstations and embedded systems.

Reference-contexts: At the endpoints of the connection we use a programming interface which provides virtual path like semantics, but does not require the implementation of real virtual paths. This is achieved by tunnelling connection setup messages through the network. Tunnelling is a term derived from mobile IP <ref> [19] </ref> in which a datagram can be encapsulated within a wrapper which has a different IP address. The datagram is routed through the network using this visible address. Outside the tunnel the datagram is stripped of the wrapper and is passed to higher layer protocols with the original addresses visible.

Reference-contexts: Each VC is likely to require individual rerouting within the ATM mesh. 8 4.2 Soft Handover and Hard Handover Hard handover, seamless handover and soft handover are terms used to describe different types of handover in cellular communication systems <ref> [20] </ref>. These terms have some relevance to a wireless ATM radio system. In hard handover, the mobile device switches from one base station to another with active data being forwarded on only one path at a time.

Reference-contexts: In a soft handover two paths may be active simultaneously and the network makes a decision about which path should be used for extraction of the data. This scheme is used by the CDMA cellular system <ref> [21] </ref>. A design requirement of the wireless ATM network that it is an extension of the existing wired ATM network. The existing wired ATM infrastructure can then be used to support base stations. Furthermore, the wireless ATM network should support the same adaptation layers as the wired ATM network.

Reference-contexts: When a collision is detected by the base station the number of contention intervals is increased and this has the effect of stabilising the ALOHA access <ref> [27] </ref>. When idle contention intervals are detected the number of contention slots is reduced until there is one left. In practice it is unlikely that there will be much contention. Much of the published data on slotted ALOHA assumes a large population and does not include the probability of capture.

Reference-contexts: The system operates in the 2.42.5GHz ISM band with a bandwidth of 10MHz per channel. Transmissions conform to the direct-sequence spread spectrum rules for power density within the European ETSI regulations <ref> [28] </ref>. Transmission power is less than 10dBm and this gives sufficient power for pico-cells of a radius of around 10 metres. The modulation scheme is QPSK with a bit-rate of 10Mbit/s; QPSK is used to reduce the symbol rate and allow us to keep within a 10MHz frequency bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: A preliminary set of trials was conducted to investigate the propagation characteristics of the prototype radio. A mobile was programmed to transmit cells continuously and was moved around the building. A fixed base station was then used to monitor reception strength and cell integrity. The ORL Active Badge system <ref> [29] </ref> was used to record the mobile's position. One of the results of the coverage trials are shown in Figure 9 with antenna diversity enabled. It can be seen that the radio physical layer supports the original requirement for 10 metre pico-cells.
