Abstract: The examples and exercises in this chapter review elementary material from numerical analysis important for what we do later. They concern approximating elementary functions, the error in these approximations, matrix algebra, and the solution of systems of equations. Both the Numerical Analysis Review [Fosdick & Jessup 95] and Elements of MATLAB [Fosdick et al. 95] tutorials are essential reading for a good understanding of the material in this chapter. MATLAB is introduced here because we believe that you will find it useful as a kind of supercalculator for short, one-time computations, and as a simple graphics tool for plotting data. Thus the examples and exercises in this chapter covers the use of MATLAB for scalar, vector, and matrix operations and plotting. As you will see later on you can even make simple movies with it! To clearly indicate what you type or what appears on the display we use this font.

Reference-contexts: Note that this means you need to use t = 0:4 . Compare the error found in this calculation with that found using Taylor's series above. You can find many of these rational approximations in a book by Hart et. al. <ref> [Hart et al. 68] </ref>; this particular approximation is on p. 119 of the book.
