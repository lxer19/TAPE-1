Abstract: With the current explosion of information on the World Wide Web (WWW) a wealth of information on many different subjects has become available on-line. Numerous sources contain information that can be classified as semi-structured. At present, however, the only way to access the information is by browsing individual pages. We cannot query web documents in a database-like fashion based on their underlying structure. However, we can provide database-like querying for semi-structured WWW sources by building wrappers around these sources. We present an approach for semi-automatically generating such wrappers. The key idea is to exploit the formatting information in pages from the source to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. We demonstrate the ease with which we are able to build wrappers for a number of internet sources in different domains using our implemented wrapper generation toolkit.

Reference-contexts: The work in [ Buneman et al., 1996 ] proposes a language for querying data that has a tree like structure and also discusses optimization issues for such a language. Lorel <ref> [ Abiteboul et al., To appear ] </ref> is a query language for semi-structured data. It is based on the OEM data model and has been implemented on top of the O2 object-oriented database system.

Reference-contexts: We successfully integrated several sources in the countries information domain, such as the CIA Fact Book, Yahoo listings of countries by region etc. using the Ariadne system, which is a descendant of the SIMS <ref> [ Arens et al., 1996 ] </ref> information mediator and which addresses the problem of integrating web sources. We were then able to pose queries to Ariadne such as " Find the External debt and Defense expenditures of all countries in EEC.".

Reference-contexts: Capability to fetch pages over a network. Currently we are using PERL scripts for the purpose of making HTTP connections to the information sources and retrieving data from them. 3. Communication between the wrapper and a mediator. We add code for KQML <ref> [ Finin et al., in press ] </ref> , an agent communication language, to facilitate communication between the wrapper and a mediator. 3 Results We have applied the wrapper generator to the task of generating wrappers for a variety of internet sources.

Reference-contexts: The focus of our work is on the generation of wrappers which can facilitate database-like querying of semi-structured data retrieved directly from Web servers as opposed to efforts that address the management of semi-structured data stored locally. The work of <ref> [ Hammer et al., 1997 ] </ref> is on wrapper generation, although the techniques discussed are for specifying wrappers for various kinds of sources such as relational databases and legacy systems besides WWW sources.

Reference-contexts: Such a parser can be automatically generated since all the grammatical and lexical information needed to parse the page is obtained in the structuring step. The compiler generator YACC <ref> [ Johnson, 1978 ] </ref> and the tool LEX are used for this purpose. Given tokens identified in the structuring step we provide specifications to LEX to generate a lexical analyzer that identifies exactly those tokens from a page.

Reference-contexts: A template based approach is used where a user provides actions that execute when a query matches a certain template or format. Wrapper generation for WWW sources is also discussed in <ref> [ Kushmerick et al., 1997 ] </ref> . The focus of their work is very similar to ours i.e., building wrappers for WWW sources to be integrated by a software agent.

Reference-contexts: We can generate a lexical analyzer that searches a page for such tokens using LEX <ref> [ Lesk, 1975 ] </ref> , a lexical analyzer generator. In Table 1 we list the regular expressions given as specifications to LEX to identify tokens indicating headings on a page. From these specifications we generate a lexical analyzer that identifies words or phrases conforming to the regular expressions.
