Abstract: Given a set of nodes N lying on the first quadrant of the Euclidean Plane E 2 , the Rectilinear Minimum Steiner Arborescence (RMSA) problem is to find a shortest-path tree of the minimum length rooted at the origin, containing all nodes in N , and composed solely of horizontal and vertical arcs oriented only from left to right or from bottom to top [1]. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing optimal or near-optimal arborescences, and present a constructive method for finding a lower bound of the length of the optimal arborescence. Experimental results indicate that the arborescences constructed by our algorithm are optimal in 71% of the cases tested, and the average tree length is within 1% from optimal. We also present an application of the RMSA formulation in the performance-driven interconnect design for the high-speed VLSI circuits. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other conventional routing methods for high-performance IC and MCM designs. A reduction of interconnection delay up to 43% is achieved by our algorithm as compared to the best known Steiner router.

Rao et al. recently established several fundamental properties of the RMSA problem and they proposed an iterative heuristic algorithm for generating an arborescence whose length has an upper bound of twice that of an optimal Steiner arborescence [1]. Given a pair of nodes p and q, let MIN (p; q) be the lower-left corner of their bounding rectangle. <p> The reader may refer to Figure 4 (a) for an example. In such a situation, we have to perform a heuristic move (a move that is possibly sub-"optimal"). In this paper, we use the following two heuristic moves adapted from the heuristic algorithm developed by Rao et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. 1. Type-1 Heuristic Move (H1-Move) 4 Select a node p in ROOT (F k ) such that p 0 = mf W (p; F k ) is farthest away from the source and introduce a rectilinear shortest path connecting p to p 0 (illustrated in Figure 4 (b)).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we prefer a routing tree of short paths in order to keep t 3 (T ) small. This, in fact, justifies the work by Cong, et al. <ref> [8] </ref> in which the radius (i.e. the longest source-sink path) of a routing tree is kept under certain bound in the layout design. <p> We have compared the generalized AT RE E algorithm with the batched 1-Steiner algorithm proposed by Kahng and Robins [13], and the bounded-radius-bounded-cost (BRBC) algorithm proposed by Cong et al. <ref> [8] </ref>. Each of the three objective functions (the OST, the SPT, and the QMST costs) in Equation 14 and the average delay were compared in Table 4 for the AT REE, 1-Steiner, and BRBC algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Our objective is to automatically generate the best interconnect topology for interconnection delay optimization. and the second tree is a shortest-path tree with the minimum tree length. In this section, we use a distributed RC delay model developed by Rubinstein, Penfield, and Horowitz <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> delay model: (1) Although this model is simpler than the commonly used Elmore delay model [10] for distributed RC circuits, it still captures the distributed nature of the circuit; (2) It gives an accurate upper bound of signal delay at every node and correlates very well with the Elmore delay <ref> [9] </ref>; (3) It is much easier to use for interconnect design optimization since it gives a uniform upper bound of the delay at every node.

Reference-contexts: However, as the technology advances to smaller device dimensions, according to the CMOS scaling rule <ref> [11] </ref>, driver resistance decreases while wire resistance increases, which leads to a significant reduction of the resistance ratio. In this case, t 2 (T ) and t 3 (T ) can no longer be ignored in the design of the next-generation VLSI circuits.
