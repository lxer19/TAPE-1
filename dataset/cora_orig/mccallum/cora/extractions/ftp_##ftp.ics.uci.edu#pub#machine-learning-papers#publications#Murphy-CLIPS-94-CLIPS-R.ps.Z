Title: AUTOMATED REVISION OF CLIPS

Abstract: This paper describes CLIPS-R, a theory revision system for the revision of CLIPS rule-bases. CLIPS-R may be used for a variety of knowledge-base revision tasks, such as refining a prototype system, adapting an existing system to slightly different operating conditions, or improving an operational system that makes occasional errors. We present a description of how CLIPS-R revises rule-bases, and an evaluation of the system on three rule-bases.

Reference-contexts: For the second domain, we deal with the nematode identification rule-base. With this rule-base, we show how CLIPS-R can be used to extend a rule-base to handle new cases.

Automobile Diagnosis Rule-Base The auto diagnosis rule-base is a rule-base of 15 rules.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this progress has not yet been put into common practice. An important reason for the absence of technology transition is that only a restricted form of knowledge bases have been addressed. In particular, only the revision of logical knowledge bases that perform classification tasks with backward chaining rules <ref> [4] </ref> has been explored. However, nearly all deployed knowledge-based systems make use of forward-chaining production rules with side effects. For example, two of the knowledge-based systems reported on at the 1993 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence use CLIPS.
