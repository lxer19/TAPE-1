Abstract: The transmission system of the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand (UMDH) is investigated theoretically and experimentally. It is shown that the friction of the routing pulleys is not negligible and should be considered in the force control of the UMDH. In the frequency range of the pneumatic actuators (80Hz), tendons act like springs and the first mode of the tendons is above that frequency range.

Reference-contexts: A rigorous description of these actuators can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Friction static and dynamic coefficients of friction are assumed to be the same in figure 3.A and different in figure 3.B (stic-tion). Figure 3.C shows linear viscous damping. A combination of these three types of friction is also possible.

Reference-contexts: We did several tests using different lengths of tendon. All of the tests show that the first resonance frequency of a tendon as long as the UMDH tendons is beyond the obtainable bandwidth of the pneumatic actuators of the UMDH which is 80 Hz <ref> [3] </ref>. Figure 11 shows the bode plot of F 1 (s) X 2 (s) where F 1 is the force measured by the Entran load cell and X 2 is measured by the displacement transducer. At low frequencies, tendons act like a simple spring.

Reference-contexts: Johnstun and Smith [5] considered dynamics of tendons with an approach which uses the water hammer equations in the fluids.

Reference-contexts: They considered dry friction and damping in the controller design. Rockenbeck [11] made some experiments to find the mass of an object held by the UMDH.

As stated in <ref> [5] </ref>, routing the tendon over several pulleys increases the overall damping in the system, but the effect is not too serious if pulleys have low-friction bearings. We would have much lower friction in the UMDH, if better bearings were used.

Reference-contexts: Guide tubes do not require any mounting surfaces, but introduce more friction. Townsend [13] studied the effect of Coulomb and stic-tion on force control with integral feedback. He found that Coulomb friction may lead to an input dependent stability. Kaneko et al. <ref> [7] </ref> also discussed the input-dependent stability observed during the torque control of a dextrous hand with tendon-sheath system. They found that the friction and compliance existing in the tendon-sheath systems, bring a hysteresis into the dependence of joint torques and actuator displacement.

Reference-contexts: They stated that the transmission characteristics is close to the gear backlash.

In <ref> [8] </ref>, the terms of apparent tendon-stiffness and equivalent backlash were defined for the tendon-sheath systems. They stated that the apparent tendon stiffness changes depend on whether the tendon is pulled or loosened. This eventually causes a direction-dependent response for force control.

Reference-contexts: This actuator is driven by either single or dual power amplifiers. Movement of the actuator is measured by an inductive displacement transducer (Data Instruments, Fastar FS380) which has a flat frequency response up to 15 kHz <ref> [9] </ref>. The Entran force sensor was used to measure the force at the fixed end. It has a useful frequency up to 10 kHz. We did several tests using different lengths of tendon.

Reference-contexts: Most dextrous hand designs feature tendon transmission systems. Tendons pass either on the pulleys or through sheaths. Pulleys are attractive because they have lower friction than guide tubes, but require mounting surfaces and are less reliable. Guide tubes do not require any mounting surfaces, but introduce more friction. Townsend <ref> [13] </ref> studied the effect of Coulomb and stic-tion on force control with integral feedback. He found that Coulomb friction may lead to an input dependent stability. Kaneko et al. [7] also discussed the input-dependent stability observed during the torque control of a dextrous hand with tendon-sheath system.
