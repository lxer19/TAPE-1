Abstract: We have chosen to concentrate our first experiments on a commercial impulse ground penetrating radar with a 1 GHz antenna and an induction coil sensor (metal detector) used for imaging purposes. The metal detector should

DeTeC DESCRIPTION AND AIMS DeTeC has three main objectives (as detailed at http://diwww.epfl.ch/lami/detec/): * To develop and test on the field by the end of 1997, a man transportable anti-personnel mine sensor that significantly reduces the false alarm rate in a selected environment.
