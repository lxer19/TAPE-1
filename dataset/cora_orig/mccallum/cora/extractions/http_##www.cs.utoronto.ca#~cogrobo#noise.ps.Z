Reference-contexts: It would seem to be more appropriate to model read as a probabilistic action. And, in particular, it is not immediately obvious that a nondeterministic action is sufficient for our purpose. Probabilistic actions were used in an approach explored by Halpern and Tuttle <ref> [HT93] </ref>. There, a general model of knowledge and probability in systems is provided, based on the framework of [FHMV95].

Roughly speaking, a system in [HT93] is identified with a set of runs or executions, where a run is a function from the natural numbers to situations. <p> In the context of the situation calculus, we can think of a run as a sequence s 0 ; s 1 ; s 2 ; : : : of situations, such that s i+1 = do (a; s i ) for some primitive action a. In <ref> [HT93] </ref>, the actions were allowed to be probabilistic, not just nondeterministic. Probabilistic actions induce probabilities over the runs. From the probabilities on runs, we get, at each situation s, a probability on other situations, by conditioning on what the agent knows at that situation. <p> Nevertheless, we can show that, at each situation, the agent places the same probabilities on other situations in the model we provide here as in the corresponding model of <ref> [HT93] </ref>. In the full version of the paper, we will show that for all formulas in our language, we get the same answer as we would using the framework of [HT93]. <p> agent places the same probabilities on other situations in the model we provide here as in the corresponding model of <ref> [HT93] </ref>. In the full version of the paper, we will show that for all formulas in our language, we get the same answer as we would using the framework of [HT93]. This shows that in our context non-deterministic read actions are sufficient, and that they yield the same answers that one would get from probabilistic read actions. Belief Update.

Reference-contexts: Notice that in making the projection we are transferring the agent's beliefs to situations with different properties. (This is somewhat related to Lewis's notion of imaging <ref> [Lew76] </ref>). In these new situations, all of the changes due to action a have occurred. For example, say that approachW (x) is the action move x units towards the wall.

When an agent only has a degree of belief in the truth of a test condition in a program, it is much less clear what it ought to do. A suitable programming formalism in this case remains to be developed.

Reference-contexts: robotics applications, for example), there was a fundamental decision that needed to be made, which determined to a large extent the character of the work to follow: Do we treat the uncertainty that results from noisy sensors and effectors quantitatively, using, for example, a probabilistic formalism such as Bayesian nets <ref> [Pea88] </ref>, or do we use a logical model, and end up with formalisms such as STRIPS, the situation calculus, or some sort of modal logic? More recently, however, it is becoming increasingly clear that we can combine both probabilistic and logical reasoning in a single framework [Bac90, Hal90].

Reference-contexts: What interests us here is the integration of these notions. An enriched version of the situation calculus, augmented with a solution to the frame problem proposed by Reiter <ref> [Rei91] </ref>, has proved to be a very convenient formalism for modeling actions, their prerequisites, and effects. Although Reiter's proposal is limited in a number of ways, it has been extended to handle aspects of the ramification problem [LR94], agent ability [LLLS95], and continuous time [Pin94]. <p> The format of the rest of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the theory of action in terms of which our account is formulated: the situ 2 ation calculus, the solution to the frame problem proposed by Reiter <ref> [Rei91] </ref>, and the extension, proposed by Scherl and Levesque [SL93], for dealing with knowledge.

To characterize this epistemic state in the language of the situation calculus, they follow Moore [Moo85] and introduce a new binary fluent K.
