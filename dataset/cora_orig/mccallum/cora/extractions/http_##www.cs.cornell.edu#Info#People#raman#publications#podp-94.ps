Reference-contexts: In the past, information was available only in a visual form, and it required a human to recreate its inherent structure. Electronic information has opened a new world: Information can now be captured in a display-independent manner |using, e.g., languages like SGML 1 <ref> [Gol90] </ref> and (L A )T E X 2 [Lam86, Knu86, ?]. Though the principal mode of display is still visual, we can now produce alternative renderings, such as oral and tactile displays. We take advantage of this to audio-format information structure present in (L A )T E X documents.

Reference-contexts: The recommended way of using it is to run Lisp as a subprocess of Emacs. Throughout, we assume familiarity with basic Emacs concepts. For full details on the various components of A S T E R, see [Ram94]. See <ref> [Ram92, ?] </ref> for a description of some of our initial work in this area. Section 3 introduces A S T E R by showing how documents can be rendered and browsed.
