Abstract: We analyze the relationship between the expected packet delay in rooted tree networks and the distribution of time needed for a packet to cross an edge using convexity-based stochastic comparison methods. For this class of networks, we extend a previously known result that the expected delay when the crossing time is exponentially distributed yields an upper bound for the expected delay when the crossing time is constant [20] using a different approach. An important aspect of our result is that unlike most other previous work, we do not assume Poisson arrivals. Our result also extends to a variety of service distributions, and it can be used to bound the expected value of all convex, increasing functions of the packet delays. An interesting corollary of our work is that in rooted tree networks, if the expectation of the crossing time is fixed, the distribution of the crossing time that minimizes both the expected delay and the expected maximum delay is constant. Our result also holds in multi-casting rooted tree networks, where a single message can have several possible destinations. Besides offering a useful analysis on this restricted class of networks, we also provide a small improvement to the bounding technique. Surprisingly, this improvement is also applicable to previously developed comparison methods, leading to an improvement in the upper bounds for greedy routing on butterfly and hypercube networks given by Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis [20].

Reference-contexts: As the expected time a packet spends in the system in equilibrium given Poisson arrivals and exponential service times can generally be computed explicitly in Markovian networks (for example, see <ref> [6] </ref> or [23, Section 6.3]), this bounding technique can give useful upper bounds. Our result shows that these bounds can be generalized on Markovian rooted tree networks. <p> We begin by considering just Markovian rooted tree networks. In a single queue, if the external arrivals are Poisson and all service times are exponential, then the departures also form a Poisson process <ref> [6, Theorem 2.1] </ref>. Hence, if the arrivals in a Markovian rooted tree network are Poisson and the service times are exponential, the arrivals at and departures from each queue form a Poisson process as well. This is the fact we will use to improve the bounds. <p> We improve these bounds by replacing all non-leaf edges with PS servers, but leave all leaf edges with constant time servers. In this case as well, if the arrivals to the network are Poisson then in equilibrium the input stream to leaf edges will be Poisson <ref> [6, Theorem 3.7] </ref>. 11 This leads to an improvement on the bounds for the expected delay of greedy routing on hypercube and butterfly networks given in [20].

Reference-contexts: Corollary 12 seems particularly interesting, since it is often difficult to analyze systems where service times are dependent. Indeed, in practice the issue is often circumvented by assuming the service times at different queues are independent as an approximation; this idea appears to date back to Kleinrock <ref> [7] </ref>. Our results also extend easily to multi-casting networks.

Reference-contexts: These techniques may also provide useful bounds in discrete time settings as well, through comparisons with the corresponding discrete time networks <ref> [10] </ref>. The fact that not just the expected delay, but any convex increasing function in the delay, can be similarly bounded is also important because in many settings, such as video or audio transmission, the variance in the delay can be as important as the delay itself.

Reference-contexts: The counter-example does not apply, 13 however, if the arrival process is Poisson; moreover, there is some evidence that in the case of Poisson arrivals, in systems where packets go to the shortest queue, constant service times are better than exponential service times <ref> [12, Chapter 4] </ref>.

Suppose that packets arrive in batches of three, batches are separated by a suitably long interval of time, and each packet proceeds to the queue with fewer packets already waiting (ties decided arbitrarily).
