Abstract: This work examines force modeling and software-based commutation for closed-loop control of planar linear motors, motivated by the need for a robust and versatile planar robot for precision assembly. The approach taken is to make measurements of the static and dynamic force capabilities of the motor as directly as possible, and determine the applicability of simple models commonly used. Measurements of force ripple, linearity with current, force reduction with skew angle, and eddy current damping forces are presented. The high-frequency current changes required for high-speed motion are shown to make the system sensitive to both the latency and update rate of the commutator and to limit the force generation capabilities at high velocities. Although this effect is caused by multiple sources, it is shown that it is well modeled as a scalar with units of time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory 1 at Carnegie Mellon University, we are interested in the use of planar linear motors as components in a modular minifactory assembly system <ref> [1] </ref>. Planar linear motors fit into such a system by providing both coarse and fine motion capabilities in a device with a single moving part. In the minifactory, multiple planar linear motors fill the role of couriers carrying sub-assemblies between processing units mounted on bridges above a common tabletop workspace.

Reference-contexts: The coil currents can also be microstepped by applying a sine wave to one coil and a cosine wave to the other. Refer to <ref> [2] </ref> or [3] for more detailed presentations of open-loop planar linear motor operation. Although these motors have found some success in industry, their open-loop operation does not give the robustness and versatility needed for use in a mini-factory. <p> However, this estimate supports the conclusion of a non-linear eddy-current force, because if this line is extended to higher velocities, it will cause drastic drops in the available acceleration, which are not observed here. Gjeltema <ref> [2] </ref>, using a Normag motor, found the eddy current drag forces to be linear with velocity. However, only the acceleration characteristics of the motor are examined.

Reference-contexts: If smoother force generation is desired, these data can be used to correct the motor forces. One approach is to generate a lookup table that gives an appropriate set of currents as a function of the phase angle and desired force, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. However, this technique requires a complete set of force data to generate the lookup table for each forcer. While three days of data collection to get these data once is reasonable, it seems excessive to do this for each forcer needed in a minifactory.

Reference-contexts: Another significant dynamic effect is the eddy current damping force caused by the large time-varying magnetic fields generated as the motor passes over the unlaminated steel platen surface.

Reference-contexts: This information is necessary to characterize the acceleration limits of the forcer for use by trajectory planners. Nordquist and Smith <ref> [11] </ref> use an alternate method for computing the eddy current damping forces. They assume the motor can be modeled over small displacements from an equilibrium position as a linear spring-mass-damper system.
