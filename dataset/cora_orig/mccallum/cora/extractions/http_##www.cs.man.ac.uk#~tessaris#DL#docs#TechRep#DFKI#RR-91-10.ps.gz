Title: A Scheme for Integrating Concrete Domains into Concept Languages  
Author: Franz Baader Philipp Hanschke

Abstract: A drawback which concept languages based on kl-one have is that all the terminological knowledge has to be defined on an abstract logical level. In many applications, one would like to be able to refer to concrete domains and predicates on these domains when defining concepts. Examples for such concrete domains are the integers, the real numbers, or also non-arithmetic domains, and predicates could be equality, inequality, or more complex predicates. In the present paper we shall propose a scheme for integrating such concrete domains into concept languages rather than describing a particular extension by some specific concrete domain. We shall define a terminological and an assertional language, and consider the important inference problems such as subsumption, instantiation, and consistency. The formal semantics as well as the reasoning algorithms are given on the scheme level. In contrast to existing kl-one based systems, these algorithms will be not only sound but also complete. They generate subtasks which have to be solved by a special purpose reasoner of the concrete domain.

Reference-contexts: Schmiedel's Temporal Terminological Logic [ Schmiedel, 1990 ] can also be seen in this light. In this case the concrete domain is given by an extension of Allen's interval calculus <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> . 1 See e.g. [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] , Section 9.2, where so-called Structural Descriptions are used to encode the concrete predicate "less than one hour". <p> As we shall see in Section 6 this algorithm is not only sound but also complete. 3 As an example, an instance of the language scheme is used in Section 7 to express Allen's interval relations <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> . <p> Then DB can be seen as a concrete domain where dom (DB) is the set of atomic values in the database. The predicates of DB are the relations which can be defined over DB with the help of the query language. * One can also consider Allen's interval calculus <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> as concrete domain AL. Here dom (AL) consists of intervals, and the predicates are built from Allen's basic interval relations with the help of logical connectives. 4 For the sake of simplicity we assume here that the formula itself is the predicate name. <p> By the induction hypothesis they are satisfied by I, and hence ax is satisfied. Finally, we use A 1 A to conclude that I is also a model for A 1 . 7 Expressing Interval Relations: An Example In <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> J. F. Allen proposes a formalism to represent relations between time intervals that is based on 13 disjoint basic relations on pairs of intervals. These relations correspond to a case analysis of the relative positions of the interval borders.

Reference-contexts: As we shall see in Section 6 this algorithm is not only sound but also complete. 3 As an example, an instance of the language scheme is used in Section 7 to express Allen's interval relations [ Allen, 1983 ] . In <ref> [ Baader, 1991 ] </ref> an extension of ALC in a 2 Agreements on feature chains are just the restriction of Role Value Maps to single-valued (i.e., functional) roles; but unlike Role Value Maps they usually do not cause undecidability of subsumption [ Hollunder and Nutt, 1990 ] . 3 All the <p> But the intended meaning of offspring is that it is the transitive closure of child, i.e., in any interpretation I the binary relation offspring I should be the transitive closure of the binary relation child I . In <ref> [ Baader, 1991 ] </ref> , the following "transitive extension" of the language ALC is investigated: instead of roles names one may use role terms involving union, composition and transitive closure of roles in concept definitions. <p> In this language, the concept Momo can be defined as Momo = Man u 8trans (child):Man: 24 The semantics of the role operator trans is defined in the obvious way, i.e., for any role R and any interpretation I, one has trans (R) I := S n . Baader <ref> [ Baader, 1991 ] </ref> shows that satisfiability and subsumption of concept terms in the extended language are still decidable. For many applications it is desirable to have both access to an admissible concrete domain and transitive closure of features. As a motivation, consider the example given in Section 7.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Concept languages based on kl-one <ref> [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] </ref> are used to represent the taxonomical and conceptual knowledge of a particular problem domain on an abstract logical level. To describe this kind of knowledge, one starts with atomic concepts and roles, and defines new concepts using the operations provided by the language. <p> Schmiedel's Temporal Terminological Logic [ Schmiedel, 1990 ] can also be seen in this light. In this case the concrete domain is given by an extension of Allen's interval calculus [ Allen, 1983 ] . 1 See e.g. <ref> [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] </ref> , Section 9.2, where so-called Structural Descriptions are used to encode the concrete predicate "less than one hour". <p> For this reason, most kl-one systems provide additional assertional capabilities. This assertional part of the system uses the concept terms for making statements about parts of a given world. The expressiveness of this component varies between the rather weak formalism employed in the original kl-one system <ref> [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] </ref> to full first order predicate logic as used in krypton [ Brachman et al., 1985 ] .

Reference-contexts: Many languages provide quantification over role fillers which allows for example to describe the concept Mother by the expression Woman u 9child:Human. kl-one was first developed for the purpose of natural language processing <ref> [ Brachman et al., 1979 ] </ref> , and some of the existing systems are still mostly used in this context (see e.g., sb-one [ Kobsa, 1989 ] ).

Reference-contexts: After this elimination|which has to be done only once for a given collection of geometric primitives| the satisfiability problems generated by our basic reasoning algorithm are purely existential problems. These problems can e.g. be solved by the method described in <ref> [ Canny, 1988 ] </ref> . As already indicated by the examples given in Section 2, there are also other interesting instances of our scheme.

Reference-contexts: The concrete domain R is admissible. This is a consequence of Tarski's decidability result for real arithmetic <ref> [ Tarski, 1951; Collins, 1975 ] </ref> . However, for the linear case (where the polynomials in the equalities and inequalities have to be linear) there exist more efficient methods (see e.g. [ Weispfenning, 1988; Loos and Weispfenning, 1990 ] ).

Reference-contexts: The concrete domain Z is not admissible since Hilbert's Tenth Problem|one of the most prominent undecidable problems <ref> [ Matijacevic, 1970; Davis, 1973 ] </ref> |is a special case of its satisfiability problem. Sometimes the adequate modeling of a problem domain could be facilitated if reference to more than one concrete domain would be possible in a terminology.

Reference-contexts: In [ Baader, 1991 ] an extension of ALC in a 2 Agreements on feature chains are just the restriction of Role Value Maps to single-valued (i.e., functional) roles; but unlike Role Value Maps they usually do not cause undecidability of subsumption <ref> [ Hollunder and Nutt, 1990 ] </ref> . 3 All the above mentioned systems employ sound but incomplete algorithms. 4 different direction is presented. It provides role-forming operators including a transitive closure operator. It is shown that the extended language still has a decidable satisfiability problem for concept terms.

Reference-contexts: A subsumption relationship may or may not exist. In [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] a sound and complete subsumption algorithm for ALC is described. The underlying method of constraint propagation was used in <ref> [ Hollunder et al., 1990 ] </ref> to derive algorithms for various other concept languages. This method can|with appropriate modifications|also be applied to the languages of the form ALC (D). <p> Obviously, we have C v D iff C u :D is unsatisfiable. This shows that an algorithm for checking satisfiability of concept terms also yields a subsumption algorithm. The algorithms described in [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Hollunder et al., 1990 ] </ref> are satisfiability algorithms. However, in the present paper we shall not directly give such an algorithm for ALC (D).

Reference-contexts: Such an algorithm for ALC without concrete domain and features can be found in <ref> [ Hollunder, 1990 ] </ref> . Since all the inference problems introduced above can be reduced to the consistency problem (see Section 3.2 and 4.2), we thus have Theorem 5.1 Let D be an admissible concrete domain.

Reference-contexts: In our example, it is very easy to see that Woman subsumes Mother. However, in general it is not at all trivial to determine such relationships. Until recently, sound and complete subsumption algorithms were only known for rather trivial concept languages (see <ref> [ Levesque and Brachman, 1987 ] </ref> ).

After this elimination|which has to be done only once for a given collection of geometric primitives| the satisfiability problems generated by our basic reasoning algorithm are purely existential problems.

Similar motivations have already led to extensions of kl-one in the above mentioned systems meson, classic, and K-Rep. The meson system provides "a separate hierarchy for describing non-concepts (e.g., integer ranges and strings)" ( <ref> [ Patel-Schneider et al., 1990 ] </ref> , p. 8) which are given as user-defined or machine-defined predicates. Similar features are provided by the "test" construct in classic.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that the Post Correspondence Problem, 25 i.e., the question whether there exists a solution for a given system, is in general undecidable if the alphabet contains at least two symbols <ref> [ Post, 1946 ] </ref> . In order to reduce this problem to a satisfiability problem for concept terms which use transitive closure of features and refer to the concrete domain R, we have to encode words into real numbers. This can be done as follows.

Reference-contexts: In this section we shall also define important properties of such domains, and give examples of concrete domains. Section 3 describes our scheme for extending a concept language by an arbitrary concrete domain. As a starting point for this extension we use the language ALC of <ref> [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] </ref> . The reason for choosing this language was that it is large enough to exhibit most of the problems connected with such an extension. Taking a larger language (e.g., including number restrictions) would only mean more work without bringing new insights. <p> If such an algorithm gives a positive answer, a subsumption relationship really exists; but if its answer is negative, then we do not know anything. A subsumption relationship may or may not exist. In <ref> [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] </ref> a sound and complete subsumption algorithm for ALC is described. The underlying method of constraint propagation was used in [ Hollunder et al., 1990 ] to derive algorithms for various other concept languages. <p> Obviously, we have C v D iff C u :D is unsatisfiable. This shows that an algorithm for checking satisfiability of concept terms also yields a subsumption algorithm. The algorithms described in <ref> [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Hollunder et al., 1990 ] are satisfiability algorithms. However, in the present paper we shall not directly give such an algorithm for ALC (D).

Reference-contexts: From a computational point of view, Structural Descriptions are as bad as Role Value Maps which cause undecidability of subsumption <ref> [ Schmidt-Schau, 1989 ] </ref> . 3 For similar reasons, Logic Programming has been extended to Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) (see e.g., [ Jaffar et al., 1990; Colmerauer, 1990; Dincbas et al., 1988 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Similar features are provided by the "test" construct in classic. In K-Rep "the roles of concepts may in turn be other (complex) concepts, as well as numbers, strings and ... arbitrary Lisp objects" ( [ Mays et al., 1988 ] , p. 62). Schmiedel's Temporal Terminological Logic <ref> [ Schmiedel, 1990 ] </ref> can also be seen in this light.

Reference-contexts: The concrete domain R is admissible. This is a consequence of Tarski's decidability result for real arithmetic <ref> [ Tarski, 1951; Collins, 1975 ] </ref> . However, for the linear case (where the polynomials in the equalities and inequalities have to be linear) there exist more efficient methods (see e.g. [ Weispfenning, 1988; Loos and Weispfenning, 1990 ] ).

Reference-contexts: if we consider it together with the T-box defined in the previous section, then Woman stands for the concept term Human u Female u ((Human u Female u 9child:Human) t 21 (age)). 10 Many kl-one based systems have a unique name assumption for their A-box individuals; but for example kl-two <ref> [ Vilain, 1985 ] </ref> does not assume unique names. For our algorithm, it would be easy to handle a unique name assumption for the abstract objects.

Reference-contexts: The concrete domain R is admissible. This is a consequence of Tarski's decidability result for real arithmetic [ Tarski, 1951; Collins, 1975 ] . However, for the linear case (where the polynomials in the equalities and inequalities have to be linear) there exist more efficient methods (see e.g. <ref> [ Weispfenning, 1988; Loos and Weispfenning, 1990 ] </ref> ). The concrete domain Z is not admissible since Hilbert's Tenth Problem|one of the most prominent undecidable problems [ Matijacevic, 1970; Davis, 1973 ] |is a special case of its satisfiability problem. <p> Since these primitives are relatively simple they can be preprocessed with the help of a quantifier elimination procedure for linear statements with parameters (see e.g. <ref> [ Weispfenning, 1988; Loos and Weispfenning, 1990 ] </ref> ). After this elimination|which has to be done only once for a given collection of geometric primitives| the satisfiability problems generated by our basic reasoning algorithm are purely existential problems.
