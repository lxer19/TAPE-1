Abstract: Network service guarantees not only provide significant performance benefits to distributed computing systems (more balanced resource utilization, fast fault recovery, and fair network access), but they are also essential for many new applications requiring real-time communications with continuous data types (audio/video). Most existing algorithms which provide network service guarantees are too complicated to be feasible in high-speed, low-cost switches for mul-ticomputer networks. The simpler algorithms proposed provide only limited service guarantees or waste significant network resources. We present a novel, cost-effective queueing and scheduling algorithm, called Rotating Combined Queueing (RCQ), which can efficiently support a range of service guarantees including deterministic delay bounds and bandwidth guarantees in multicomputer networks. By allowing bursty traffic to utilize unused network resources efficiently, RCQ also can provide competitive performance to best-effort data communications. Such cost-effective service guarantees not only provide substantial benefits to the overall system performance, but can also further expand the domain of multi-computer applications to encompass distributed multimedia applications requiring isochronous communications.

Reference-contexts: Recently, some parallel computer vendors have found new applications in the area of multimedia and data servers <ref> [1] </ref>. In the networks of such parallel systems, a variety of traffic types will coexist ranging from best-effort traffic for transaction applications or parallel computations to real-time traffic for audio and video communications.

Reference-contexts: Reliable computing can also get substantial benefits from guaranteed communication performance, where network faults can be detected and recovered much earlier with guaranteed and controlled delay bounds. Interestingly, several recent studies <ref> [16, 2] </ref> show that more hardware supports for communication protocols may improve the overall communication performance. It is shown that, in most existing multicomputers, communication speeds are dominated by end-node software overheads rather than raw network hardware speeds.

Reference-contexts: To decide the highest priority packet, N comparators are also needed. By reusing some of the counters, VC would be feasible at much lower costs, but at increased run-time scheduling overheads. Conversely, faster VC switches can be implemented with more expensive hardware support <ref> [3] </ref>. So, the scheduling logic for VC requires about 1 million transistors. With reduced component sizes as well as their reduced quantities, ALU scheduling logic requires about 10,000 transistors, only 1% of VC scheduling logic. Compared to VC, RCQ needs only 20% of the scheduling logic.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, existing switch designs cannot support both bursty data and real-time communications at the same time.

While time-division multiplexing supports real-time traffic, on the other hand, it cannot support bursty communications efficiently. <p> When supporting different traffic types together in integrated service networks, the service quality given to one traffic type should not be affected by existence of other traffic types. 2.2 Problems of Existing Multicomputer Switches Most existing multicomputer network switches <ref> [13, 5] </ref> adopt simple arbitration strategies such as round-robin (RR) or first-come-first-serve (FCFS), which distribute resources uniformly to local traffic. While permitting high-speed switching, these simple arbitration schemes have many limitations especially for next-generation, integrated-service multicom-puter networks.

So, it cannot efficiently support communications with both low delay bounds and low bandwidth requirements. In previous work <ref> [10] </ref>, hierarchical framing was proposed as a solution, but it is not clear that it can be implemented in low-cost switches.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the Virtual Clock algorithm [25] is too complicated for low-cost, high-performance switch implementations. The Stop-and-Go algorithm [10] is much simpler, but cannot support bursty traffic efficiently. Another approach recently introduced in the Tandem ServerNet <ref> [11] </ref> is both simple and efficient, but its quality of service is not satisfactory for many real-time applications. <p> This strict regulation of traffic flow rate provides better service guarantees at less control complexity. Unfortunately, this approach wastes precious network resources when some connections do not fully utilize their reserved bandwidth portions, so it is only applicable to pure CBR traffic. Recently, the Tandem ServerNet <ref> [11] </ref> integrated a flexible arbitration algorithm called ALU biasing into its switch architecture, which reduces scheduling complexity dramatically by scheduling packets only based on input physical links rather than virtual connections. <p> Connection-based switching: At the connection setup time, routing is determined and bandwidth is reserved along the path. Information for each established connection is stored in the look-up table of the switch. For recent multi-computer switches using table-based routing as in the Tandem ServerNet <ref> [11] </ref>, the extra cost for storing service information must be moderate. Output queueing: Multiple packets arriving simultaneously for an output link are queued at the output module, in which they are scheduled for transmission. Output queueing provides significantly better performance than input queueing by reducing the head-of-line (HOL) blocking [17].

Reference-contexts: This is primarily because the cost, complexity, or resource waste of existing solutions can easily overwhelm their expected benefits. The proposed queueing and scheduling algorithms can be divided into two major categories, work-conserving and nonwork-conserving, depending on whether each switch does rate control or not <ref> [24] </ref>. In work-conserving switches, if there are packets pending for idle channels, they must be transmitted through the channels immediately. In contrast, nonwork-conserving switches may enforce additional delay to packets even if the target output channels keep idle.
