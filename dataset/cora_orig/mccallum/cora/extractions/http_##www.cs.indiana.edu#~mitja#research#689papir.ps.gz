Abstract: This paper presents a 3D musical notation VR system. The various parts of this project span different research domains: music cognition, visual perception and data visualization. While each system component will need a detailed study to proceed from requirements to an operative software system design, this paper focuses mainly on visualization issues.

Reference-contexts: Synesthesia appears to be a "left-hemisphere function that is not cortical in the conventional sense". [Cytowic89] Whether synesthetic experiences reflect some intrinsic sensory correspondences has not yet been fully explained, but there is some evidence 8 that it could be indeed so <ref> [Marks75] </ref>. As a counter-example, important composers as Scri-abin and Rimsky-Korsakov, for example, disagreed on the color of given notes and musical keys. 7 Display To display standard musical notation, the building blocks consist of canonically defined symbols for notes, staves, embellishment, expressivity notations etc.

Reference-contexts: So called Robust Front End processing algorithms are aimed at solving this problem, such as the Blackboard Framework <ref> [Martin96] </ref>. A comparison of the (known) input notation of the musical excerpt used to test the system, to the output provided by the automatic transcription, shows how the extracted information is incorrect about one out of of five times.

Reference-contexts: Spatially, the structure of a Bach's Canon can be presented using the structure obtained from a form analysis, such as in Figure 11. This method does not use standard music notation, but it's been extensively used in interactive explanations of form analysis bases <ref> [Smith97] </ref>. Adding color to Standard Musical Notation can start from the same viewpoint of form analysis.
