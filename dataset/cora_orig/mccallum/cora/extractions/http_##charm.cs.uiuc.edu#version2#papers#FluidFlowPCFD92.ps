Abstract: A portable parallel implementation of a fractional step method to solve 3D unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on MIMD machines is described. The context currently considered involves uniform grid spacing in one of the directions. A parallel decomposition strategy and its implementation on a portable parallel programming system (Charm) is described. Some optimizations including one that reduces the cost of parallel convergence tests are described. Performance results for calculation of flow in a driven cavity on different parallel computers are presented.

Reference-contexts: With the availability of low-cost, high-performance nonshared memory parallel machines including intel iPSC and NCUBE hypercubes, there has been growing interest in the scientific community to use these machines <ref> [1] </ref>. Programming on these machines is obviously more difficult than sequential programming.

Reference-contexts: Machine independence is achieved by using Charm parallel programming environment <ref> [2] </ref>. Charm is a runtime support system which allows machine independent parallel programming across MIMD machines. It provides an explicit parallel language which uses C as its base language. It hides the details of underlying machine architecture, communication and process management from the user.

Reference-contexts: These equations are discretized on a staggered grid using the central difference scheme of Harlow-Welch <ref> [3] </ref>. A fractional step method [4] is used for the time integration.

Reference-contexts: Next, a Poisson equation is solved for the pressure field, p. For the current problem, we assumed that the grid is uniform along the z direction. Therefore, the Poisson equation is solved by applying FFT in that direction. The resulting penta-diagonal equations are solved with Stone's method <ref> [5] </ref> (a strongly implicit iterative method). Finally, the intermediate velocity fields are corrected using the pressure values. Algorithm-1 shows the basic flow of this computation. Algorithm-1 Basic Flow of Sequential Algorithm 1.

Reference-contexts: A number of asynchronous access and update calls are allowed on table entries. The Charm system provides other information sharing mechanisms such as monotonic and accumulator variables. Details about these features can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. It also provides a sophisticated module system that facilitates reuse, and large-scale programming for parallel software. 3. PROBLEM 3.1.
