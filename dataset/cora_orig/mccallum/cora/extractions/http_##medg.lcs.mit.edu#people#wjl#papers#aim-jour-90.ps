Reference-contexts: Thus, Pearl's algorithm would require weighted summing of about 2 40 solutions, which is completely infeasible. Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter's algorithm [11] might improve on this as well as more recent efforts to provide fast implementations <ref> [1] </ref>, but the computation would remain infeasible. Indeed, Cooper has shown that the problem is NP-hard [3]. Thus heuristic methods are necessary to handle the complex networks required to represent this domain.

Reference-contexts: Others were determined from data in the literature, such as the relation between heart rate and systolic time. Basic hemodynamic relations were also borrowed from existing models such as Coleman's Human Program <ref> [2] </ref>, including the relation between blood pressure and vagal stimulation. Included are equations for the hemodynamic effects of congestive cardiomyopathy (primary muscle disease) and four of the valvular diseases (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and more recently mitral regurgitation).

Indeed, Cooper has shown that the problem is NP-hard <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus heuristic methods are necessary to handle the complex networks required to represent this domain. We have developed a mechanism to generate the differential diagnosis based on the causal paths from primary nodes to the findings.

Reference-contexts: The parameters are organized by type and region of circulation with arrows showing the circulatory flow. The data in the paper included the heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary wedge pressure <ref> [5] </ref>. The rest of the initial parameter values (shown at the bottoms of the parameters) were computed from these to run the model, making assumptions consistent with the state of the patient.

Reference-contexts: The valvular diseases are modeled by equations relating the pressure drops or regurgitant volumes to the effective valve area from the original hydraulics equations developed by Gorlin <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. The therapies in the model include representative drugs from most of the major classes of cardiovascular therapies. Each therapy is represented by its direct effects on parameters, with proportions determined by comparing the model predictions 7 to published results.

Reference-contexts: This case base uses a self-organizing memory system implemented by Koton [10] and patterned after the memory system developed by Kolodner <ref> [8] </ref>. It consists of two kinds of data structures gens, which are generalizations representing two or more cases, and cases, which contain the identification, description, input findings, and accepted diagnosis of an individual case. These structures are organized as a network with the case structures as terminal nodes.

Reference-contexts: These causal hypotheses can be compared by computing their probabilities. The set of ranked causal hypotheses is the differential diagnosis for the case. The second method of diagnosis is the case-based diagnosis program, CASEY, developed by Phyllis Koton <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. This makes use of the data base of cases to find a close match to the findings and then uses the physiologic model to resolve the differences, if they are minor.

This is an alternative diagnosis generator, allowing a comparison of different methodologies. It also allows the user to find similar cases for comparison.

Reference-contexts: However, even eliminating the forward loops in an earlier model version there were still about 40 links that would have to be cut to analyze multiple paths between nodes. Thus, Pearl's algorithm would require weighted summing of about 2 40 solutions, which is completely infeasible. Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter's algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> might improve on this as well as more recent efforts to provide fast implementations [1], but the computation would remain infeasible.

Reference-contexts: These probabilities could be normalized by the probability of the findings but that is an intractable problem and unnecessary as long as we are only rank ordering hypotheses. The algorithm is discussed in detail in a paper <ref> [12] </ref>. This approach to diagnosis differs considerably from others that have appeared in the literature. Reggia's minimal set covering approach [20] ignores the fact that the best hypothesis may not be minimal and would not find the hypothesis in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: When the hemodynamic data are fairly complete, the initial values of the model parameters can be computed or estimated and the model can simulate the patient. Our efforts in validating the model were very fruitful <ref> [13] </ref>. The model proved sufficient to account for the average behavior reported in each of the five papers studied.

Reference-contexts: Initially, we applied this mechanism to a model with qualitative relations on the links between parameters. This worked well in our early tests in which the actions of drugs in the normal patient were compared to the model predictions <ref> [14] </ref>, but we had considerable difficulty extending the model to account for the behavior of mitral stenosis, the first valvular disease considered. Since most of the parameters have known quantitative relationships to other parameters and the computational mechanism supports quantitative reasoning, we converted the model to use quantitative relations.

Reference-contexts: This hypothesis illustrates several features of the algorithm: 1) it handles multiple causes; 2) it handles multiple pathways between nodes; 3) findings can be left unexplained (the murmur); and 4) findings caused by therapies (digitalis toxicity here) are handled. (This example is discussed in more detail in <ref> [15] </ref>.) This method of generating hypotheses is heuristic and indeed it is possible to construct networks where it does not find the best answer. However, only the search is heuristic, not the use of probabilities in ranking hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: The result is a program with uses in many phases of the patient management process. 2 Introduction Over the past few years we have been developing a program to assist the physician in reasoning about the diagnosis and management of patients with cardiovascular disease characterized by manifestations of heart failure <ref> [16] </ref>. Since heart failure just means that the disease process makes cardiac output inadequate for the demands of the body, there are many possible causes.

Reference-contexts: The mechanism for prediction of the effects of therapy is based on signal flow analysis <ref> [17] </ref> and computes the changes in the parameters from steady state to steady state.

Reference-contexts: The differential 9 consists of the hypotheses found that have the highest probability. The appropriate mechanism for finding the differential depends on the nature of the diagnostic causal model. The model is similar to those investigated by Pearl <ref> [19] </ref> as Bayesian probability networks. The difference is that this model has forward loops (excluded by Pearl) and nodes with multiple paths between them (handled only in exponential time by Pearl's methods). We investigated modifications to Pearl's algorithm and to our model.

If every node were treated that way, a network of this size would be computationally intractable.
