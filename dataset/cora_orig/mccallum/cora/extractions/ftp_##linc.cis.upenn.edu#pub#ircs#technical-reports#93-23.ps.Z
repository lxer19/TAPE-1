Reference-contexts: Another work with much in common with the proverb theory is [Rooth, 1981]. Rooth develops a Montague grammar approach, using the general framework of <ref> [Bach and Partee, 1980] </ref>. Rooth extends this framework by adding a discourse rule and treats VP ellipsis on an analogy with the quantifying-in rule for NP's.

Reference-contexts: [ : : : x : : : ] V P I will now consider the converse of this configuration, where the ellipsis site appears to have this form: wh y : : : [ : : : y : : : ] V P E It has been argued <ref> [Chao, 1987; Tancredi, 1992] </ref> that this configuration is evidence for syntactic reconstruction, since there appears to be a wh-trace, y, within the ellipsis site. I will show that this argument is based on a faulty analysis of the relevant examples. <p> Who didn't he? These examples, on the above analysis, seem to show that the elided VP can contain a wh-trace and therefore must have internal syntactic structure. However, this is not consistent with the proverb theory, which requires that the elided VP contain no internal syntactic structure. <ref> [Chao, 1987] </ref> and others have argued that, in examples of this type, VP ellipsis must be syntactically reconstructed to allow wh-binding within the ellipsis site. <p> Deictics In some cases, the antecedent is available from the non-linguistic context. For example, 33 (108) You shouldn't have. (on receipt of a present) (109) I will if you will. (standing on the edge of a cold swimming pool, about to jump) <ref> [Chao, 1987] </ref> (110) Not in my wastebasket you don't! (to someone about to toss something in the waste basket) [Schacter, 1977] In all these cases, the missing property is contextually available, and not linguistically present. <p> However, while Hankamer and Sag judge these to be ungrammatical, these judgements are not universally accepted; for example, <ref> [Chao, 1987] </ref> reports that many speakers find (136) acceptable. In my judgement, these examples are somewhat degraded, while (131) - (134) are quite a bit better. It appears that one cannot categorically rule out such cases, as Hankamer and Sag do. <p> It has been claimed that a wh-trace appears within the elided VP, and furthermore, that the trace is subject to island constraints. <ref> [Chao, 1987] </ref> has suggested that VP ellipsis must be syntactically reconstructed in cases where wh-binding takes place within the ellipsis site.

Reference-contexts: The discourse models of the sentence (B) and prior discourse (A) are combined together. This rule should in principle be assimilated to the function application schema. This could perhaps be accomplished by defining a proposition as a function on subsequent discourse, along the lines of <ref> [Chierchia, 1992] </ref>. I will not investigate this here, as it involves issues not immediately germane to the current study. 3.5.4 Lexical Items Lexical items have syntactic and semantic representations which fully define the way they can participate in derivations, based on the simple rule schema given above.

Reference-contexts: In such approaches, there is no convenient way to consider alternative indexing possibilities for a given pronoun; one must simply consider different derivations. This is the case, for example, in many versions of Government-Binding theory 5 <ref> [Chomsky, 1981] </ref>. Various filters are then defined to rule out structures, based on the indexing of pronouns. To build in preferences involving such factors as recency and salience, one might imagine that, in addition to filtering invalid derivations, valid derivations are ranked according to these preference factors.

Reference-contexts: I will not consider such cases. 2 The same prediction is made by the equational approach of <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>, as pointed out in [Dalrymple, 1992].

Consider the following example: 6 Examples violating Schema 1 due to [Wescoat, 1989] are discussed in <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>, such as: The policeman who arrested John failed to read him his rights, and so did the one who arrested Bill. 7 This generalization is consistent with the results of a psycholinguistic study described by [Hirschberg and Ward, 1991], where it is argued that the structural constraints <p> have in the past.

(heard in conversation) (134) A lot of this material can be presented in a fairly informal and accessible fashion, and often I do. (Chomsky 1982, cited in <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>) In these examples, the antecedent for the elliptical VP is not a VP. In (131), the antecedent for the elliptical VP is something to the effect of release this information this does not appear as a VP in the antecedent. <p> I show that neither of these arguments is convincing. Next, I discuss lambda abstraction accounts of VP ellipsis: this includes the Sag/Williams account, which has already been discussed in Chapter Two, and the equational approach of <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>. The equational approach is a major departure from the Sag/Williams account in that it does not associate strict and sloppy readings with an ambiguity in the antecedent. However, it retains the use of the lambda abstraction mechanism to explain sloppy identity. <p> If it is represented as a bound variable, a sloppy reading results from the reapplication of the lambda expression, otherwise, we get a strict reading. While this account seems to provide an elegant solution to the problem of sloppy identity, <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref> demonstrate that it must be fundamentally revised. 4.3.2 The Equational Approach [Dalrymple et al., 1991] point to examples such as the following (due originally to [Dahl, 1973]: 1 (13) John thinks he is a fool. Harry does too, although his wife doesn't. <p> While this account seems to provide an elegant solution to the problem of sloppy identity, <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref> demonstrate that it must be fundamentally revised. 4.3.2 The Equational Approach [Dalrymple et al., 1991] point to examples such as the following (due originally to [Dahl, 1973]: 1 (13) John thinks he is a fool. Harry does too, although his wife doesn't. <p> The elided VP need not be a property in the Equational approach. Rather, the Equational Approach countenances an unboundedly large set of possible types for elided VP's. To see this, consider the Equational analysis of the following example <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991, pages 20-21] </ref>: 68 (23) The person who introduced Mary to John would not give her his phone number, nor would the person who introduced Sue to Bill. [Wescoat, 1989] [Dalrymple et al., 1991] present the following equation for this example: P (pwi (m,j),m,j) = refuse (pwi (m,j),give <p> To see this, consider the Equational analysis of the following example [Dalrymple et al., 1991, pages 20-21]: 68 (23) The person who introduced Mary to John would not give her his phone number, nor would the person who introduced Sue to Bill. [Wescoat, 1989] <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref> present the following equation for this example: P (pwi (m,j),m,j) = refuse (pwi (m,j),give (m,phone (j))) Solving for P results in the following semantic object: x. y. z.refuse (x,give (y,phone (z))) Here, the missing object corresponding to the elided VP is a three-place relation, that is, an <p> Thus the system can derive readings not permitted by lambda abstraction approaches such as the Sag/Williams account or the equational account <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>. 5.3 The Location Question: Determining the Antecedent VP In this section, I describe an algorithm for selecting the antecedent for VP ellipsis occurrences. The algorithm operates on VP meanings stored in the discourse model, in two stages. First, any impossible antecedents are eliminated. <p> have in the past. (5/24/91 NPR Morning Edition interview) (26) The ice cream should be taken out of the freezer, if you can. (heard in conversation) (27) A lot of this material can be presented in a fairly informal and accessible fashion, and often I do. (Chomsky 1982, cited in <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>) To allow such examples, it is necessary to expand the set of possible antecedents, VPlist. Upon the occurrence of a passive sentence S, we now add to VPlist a VP 0 , where VP 0 is the VP in the active counterpart of S. <p> The following is a derivation for example (56): [[ TOM likes MARY, and HARRY does SUSAN.]] = and (like (Tom,Mary), ( &lt;x,y&gt;. like (x,y)) &lt;Harry,Susan&gt;) = and (like (Tom,Mary), like (Harry,Susan). If one considers the class of elliptical constructions uniformly, as in <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>, it appears that the language interpreter is presented with a highly unconstrained problem. The division of ellipsis into proforms and conjunction forms suggests that each class is in fact highly constrained. <p> But they are very constrained in that the antecedent clause must immediately precede the ellipsis clause. Also, the corresponding elements must be unambiguously marked by focus. The 4 operator is similar to the matching mechanism of <ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] </ref>. But it is applied here in a very constrained fashion: the parallel elements are completely specified by focus, and the antecedent clause must be conjoined to the ellipsis clause.

Reference-contexts: One example of this involves strict readings for reflexives, as discussed in Chapter Two. Similarly, it is well known that binding constraints on names are not enforced under ellipsis. An example of this is the following: (1) Harry got to Sue's apartment before she did. <ref> [Dalrymple, 1991] </ref> The overt counterpart of this sentence would constitute a Principle C violation, while this violation is not observed in the elided version. Since the syntactic binding constraints are not enforced equivalently under ellipsis, a syntactic reconstruction approach must relax the identity condition in some way.

Reference-contexts: Storing the individual associated with the indefinite determiner reflects the fact that this object is available for subsequent intersentential reference. Expanding on Heim's insight, I will treat VP's as indefinite properties. This has been suggested by many theorists, most prominently in the work of <ref> [Davidson, 1980] </ref>. In the context of the current system, this means that the occurrence of a verb phrase introduces a dynamic property which is available for subsequent intersentential reference.

Reference-contexts: The phenomenon of sloppy identity becomes, from this perspective, a reflection of a very simple fact: non-deictic variables are not required to designate the same individual in different contexts. Thus the strict/sloppy ambiguity is a reflection of the same ambiguity seen in modal contexts, the so-called referential/attributive ambiguity <ref> [Donnellan, 1966] </ref>, illustrated by the following example: (93) The President could have been a Republican. On the referential (strict) reading, (93) is true only if it was possible that Bill Clinton was a Republican. The attributive (sloppy) reading is true if it was possible that some Democrat was president.

Reference-contexts: Syntactic reconstruction theories are free to treat these examples as ordinary VP ellipsis. However, there are similar cases which must be treated as pseudogapping by syntactic reconstruction theories as well, as pointed out in <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992a] </ref>. Consider: (77) John criticized Mary, who Bill didn't. Here again, it does not appear that focus is required for Mary. To account for this, either pseudogapping should not be placed in the conjunction forms category, or the focus-marking requirement must be relaxed.

Reference-contexts: a reciprocal is divided into a distributor and a variable, the desired reading is derived without any further stipulations, simply permitting the variable to be reinterpreted at the ellipsis site, as usual. 6 6 Lappin (p.c.) suggests that a syntactic reconstruction theory could derive this reading by applying vehicle change <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992b] </ref>, in effect allowing each other from the antecedent to change to the other at the ellipsis site. 56 3.7 Extending the System: Split Antecedents I observed in Chapter Two that VP ellipsis occurrences sometimes have a split antecedent, as in (94), repeated here in slightly modified form: <p> Since the syntactic binding constraints are not enforced equivalently under ellipsis, a syntactic reconstruction approach must relax the identity condition in some way. To deal with examples such as (1), <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992b] </ref> define an operation called vehicle change, which allows certain differences between antecedent and elided material. One such change is the conversion of names to pronouns. Applied to (1), this gives: (2) Harry got to Sue's apartment before she did [got to her apartment]. <p> For example, they do not restrict sloppy readings to subject covariance, as is the case in lambda abstraction approaches. <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992b] </ref> define a syntactic parallelism constraint to constrain sloppy readings. In Chapter Seven, I suggest that this parallelism constraint cannot be defined syntactically. The proverb theory treats sloppy identity for NP anaphora and VP ellipsis in a uniform fashion. <p> A similar criticism can be made of any account in which the strict/sloppy ambiguity reflects an ambiguity in the representation of the antecedent clause, such as <ref> [Reinhart, 1983; Fiengo and May, 1992b; Higginbotham, 1992] </ref>. 2 In the equational approach of [Dalrymple 1 A similar point can be made based on an example due to [Gawron and Peters, 1990]: John revised his paper before the teacher did, and Bill did too. 2 [Fiengo and May, 1992b] suggest a <p> the antecedent clause, such as [Reinhart, 1983; Fiengo and May, 1992b; Higginbotham, 1992]. 2 In the equational approach of [Dalrymple 1 A similar point can be made based on an example due to [Gawron and Peters, 1990]: John revised his paper before the teacher did, and Bill did too. 2 <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992b] </ref> suggest a solution to this problem within their approach, which I will not address here. 64 et al., 1991] , the problem of cascaded ellipsis is solved, while retaining the lambda abstraction mechanism of the Sag/Williams account. <p> Now I look at the reverse case, where there is an active antecedent and a passive VP ellipsis. Again, this is possible only in restricted cases. The following example seems marginal at best: 89 (32) ?* Max fired Harry, although it was Tom who should have been. <ref> [Fiengo and May, 1992b] </ref> However, I find the following variations quite acceptable: (33) It was Harry who they fired, although it was Tom who should have been. (34) Harry, they fired, although Tom's the one who should have been.

Reference-contexts: As in the present work, a VP occurrence stores a VP meaning, which 6 I am ignoring intensionality in these semantic types. 7 In addition, there are sketches of semantic approaches in <ref> [Fodor and Sag, 1982] </ref> and [Sag and Hankamer, 1984]. 69 can be accessed to resolve an occurrence of VP ellipsis. Also, Rooth's treatment shares with the proverb theory the view that the elliptical VP, as a proform, has no internal syntactic structure. Rooth does not address the free variable constraint.

Reference-contexts: Most studies of VP ellipsis have claimed that VP ellipsis requires a single VP as its antecedent <ref> [Hankamer and Sag, 1976; Partee and Bach, 1984] </ref>. In fact, there are a variety of other antecedence possibilities. In this section I look at cases involving split antecedents, long distance antecedents and missing antecedents. <p> However, it would be the VP in the active counterpart of the antecedent. I will term this the active property. These examples show that, in a passive sentence, the active property can be the antecedent for VP ellipsis. <ref> [Hankamer and Sag, 1976] </ref> argue that this is not possible for VP ellipsis, based on examples such as the following: (135) * The oats had to be taken down to the bin, so Bill did. (136) * The children asked to be squirted with the hose, so we did. <p> However, one might argue that you is understood as the deep subject of the antecedent clause. This suggests a looser formulation of the subject coreference rule. It is interesting to contrast the naturally-occurring (26) with the following example from <ref> [Hankamer and Sag, 1976] </ref>: (30) * The oats had to be taken down to the bin, so Bill did. This example clearly does not fall under the subject coreference rule, since Bill is in no sense the understood deep subject of the antecedent.

Reference-contexts: In a study of VP ellipsis occurrences in the Brown Corpus (discussed in Chapter Six), I found that about 5% of VP ellipsis occurrences were long-distance, i.e., where one or more sentences intervened between antecedent and VP ellipsis <ref> [Hardt, 1990] </ref>. One example is the following: (105) I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled. The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price, far less than I had expected to pay.

Reference-contexts: Consider the following example: (70) Martha and Irv wanted to dance with each other. I will assume that the following predicate is being applied to the subject Martha and Irv: = x.want (x,dance (x,y)) Following recent work on reciprocals <ref> [Heim et al., 1991; Roberts, 1991] </ref>, I will assume that the reciprocal each other makes two separate semantic contributions: each is a distributive operator (DIST) applied to the VP ;other is a variable that is bound outside .

Reference-contexts: These objects may be stored with some contextual dependencies as yet unresolved. As discussed below, this is crucial to the treatment of sloppy identity. For individuals, this is implemented as follows: following <ref> [Heim, 1982] </ref>, I will assume that indefinites add individuals to the discourse model. I will therefore associate an indefinite assumption with indefinite NP's which must be discharged at some point in the course of a derivation, adding a new individual to the discourse model. <p> Furthermore, it is not c-commanded by Tom. However, perhaps the problem is not the bound-sloppy correlation, but rather, the notion of a bound variable. I treat any variable that refers to an entity in the discourse model as a bound variable. This is made explicit in <ref> [Heim, 1982] </ref>, where an operation of existential closure binds all variables that refer to discourse entities. The only variables that do not refer to discourse entities are deictics, as discussed above. <p> This follows from the claim that meanings are dynamic, i.e., they may involve dependencies on context. This is what permits sloppy identity in the system, as will be described below. Consider first the case of pronouns and their antecedents. As in <ref> [Heim, 1982] </ref>, the notion of definiteness is central: an indefinite NP adds a semantic object to the discourse model, and a definite NP selects an antecedent from the discourse model.

Reference-contexts: However, in many cases, there does seem to be a tendency to favor a sloppy reading. For many speakers, the following example exhibits a strong preference for a sloppy reading: (56) John likes himself. Bill does too. Based on the contrast between examples like (53) and (56), <ref> [Hestvik, 1992] </ref> suggests that, in coordinated sentences, the reflexive shows a strong tendency for a sloppy reading, and that a strict reading must be forced pragmatically or otherwise. However, if the VP ellipsis clause is subordinated to the antecedent clause, Hestvik argues, the strict reading is generally available.

Reference-contexts: In this section, I give evidence that this is the case. I will examine what is perhaps the most widely studied semantic constraint on variables: the constraint that indexical or deictic variables cannot vary across contexts; that is, deictics are rigid designators (cf. <ref> [Kaplan, 1989; Nunberg, 1991] </ref>. In general, variables are permitted to vary with context, so that a single variable might designate different individuals. Consider the following example: (76) The speaker could have been a linguist. Here, the modal operator could requires the consideration of many different possible contexts.

This should apply equally to individuals as well as properties, whenever the antecedent contains an embedded variable.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it appears that the distance between antecedent and VP ellipsis can exceed the normal memory for syntactic structure. Such long-distances examples have sometimes been noted in the literature. <ref> [Klein and Stainton-Ellis, 1989] </ref> report several naturally-occurring examples of long-distance VP ellipsis. They also point to examples which involve multiple occurrences of VP ellipsis, such as the following: (106) A: You never go swimming. (107) B: That's because I don't look good in a swimming costume.

Reference-contexts: The meaning of a VP, a relation on contexts and properties, is termed a dynamic property. The basic constraint for VP ellipsis, then, is an identity of dynamic properties. The dependency of a proform on its antecedent is often denoted by coindexing. Typically 1 The approach in <ref> [Klein, 1984] </ref> is similar in that it extends the discourse model to include properties. They are not dynamic properties, however.

Reference-contexts: I don't address the issue of how this semantic derivation is mapped from the surface syntax. One possibility is to treat INFL uniformly as a raising verb, as proposed by <ref> [Koopman and Sportiche, 1991] </ref>. 46 There are two assumptions: a def assumption one associated with the variable he, and an indef assumption associated with the matrix VP thinks he is smart 4 . The def assumption, upon discharge, determines the referent of the pronoun.

Reference-contexts: However, on closer examination, it will emerge that these are not in fact cases of VP ellipsis at all. <ref> [Lappin and McCord, 1990] </ref> have shown that such examples can be analyzed as pseudo-gapping. Pseudo-gapping involves an elided verb, but a non-elided argument to the verb. For example: (36) Tom writes books, and Harry does magazines. (37) Tom kissed Mary, and Harry did Susan. <p> This is illustrated by the following example: 10 In fact, such examples can be analyzed as pseudogapping rather than VP ellipsis, as suggested in <ref> [Lappin and McCord, 1990] </ref>. Thus, these examples do not in fact involve antecedent containment. 84 (9) John is smart. Harry does too. Clearly, is smart is not a possible antecedent for the elliptical VP does too. <p> For a computational system, a method is required to determine the antecedent, after which the possible readings can be determined. <ref> [Lappin and McCord, 1990] </ref> present an algorithm for VP ellipsis which contains a partial treatment of this problem. However, while they define three possible ellipsis-antecedent configurations, they have nothing to say about selecting among alternatives, if there is more than one 99 VP in an allowed configuration. <p> As discussed in Chapter Two, the proverb theory requires a pseudogapping analysis of these structures, since there would otherwise be a wh-trace within the ellipsis site 12 . It is not clear 11 See [Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977; May, 1985] for the analysis of antecedent-contained VP deletion. 12 See <ref> [Lappin and McCord, 1990] </ref> for arguments for a pseudogapping analysis of antecedent-contained deletion structures.

Reference-contexts: like his i work, but in Bill j 's case, I think she actually will.

Reference-contexts: However, pseudo-gapping has a much more constrained distribution than VP ellipsis, appearing most naturally in constructions such as comparative clauses, subordinate clauses, or directly adjacent clauses. (This is pointed out in <ref> [Levin, 1985] </ref>.) I will show that the examples of the sort mentioned above pattern with pseudo-gapping rather than VP ellipsis. <p> Another example is the following: (44) *Although it doesn't me, it takes Karen a long time to clean the hamster's cage. 8 This is observed in [Sag, 1976, page 83]. 18 (45) Although it doesn't always, it sometimes takes a long time to clean the hamster's cage. <ref> [Levin, 1985, page 53] </ref> Again the wh-trace example patterns with pseudo-gapping: (46) *Although I don't know who it doesn't, it takes Karen a long time to clean the hamster's cage. <p> Finally, Levin observes that pseudo-gapping cannot appear in infinitive clauses, although VP ellipsis can.

Reference-contexts: Most studies of VP ellipsis have claimed that VP ellipsis requires a single VP as its antecedent <ref> [Hankamer and Sag, 1976; Partee and Bach, 1984] </ref>. In fact, there are a variety of other antecedence possibilities. In this section I look at cases involving split antecedents, long distance antecedents and missing antecedents. <p> However, it retains the use of the lambda abstraction mechanism to explain sloppy identity. I briefly describe two important critiques of the lambda abstraction approach: first, [Webber, 1978] gives numerous examples which cannot be handled by the lambda abstraction approach. Secondly, <ref> [Partee and Bach, 1984] </ref> show that the constraints imposed by the lambda abstraction approach are incompatible with basic notions in model-theoretic semantics, such as compositionality and the need to refer to types rather than tokens in the semantics. <p> This constraint is the focus of the second critique of lambda abstraction: that of <ref> [Partee and Bach, 1984] </ref>. Here, it is argued that the free variable constraint is incompatible with basic notions in model-theoretic semantics, such as compositionality and the need to refer to types rather than tokens in the semantics.

Reference-contexts: I would claim that the occurrence of me in the antecedent is not a deictic expression in this case. 26 reading would result. It is interesting to examine another type of variable in this context: it has been suggested <ref> [Partee, 1991] </ref> that expressions like locally involve a hidden variable that can be bound by other operators. On the other hand, the term here is generally recognized to be deictic. This explains the following contrast: (82) John shops locally. Susan does too. (83) John shops around here. Susan does too.

Reference-contexts: I have argued that this constraint must be removed on empirical grounds, thus the semantic complications introduced by Sag are unnecessary. [Lappin, 1984] also suggests a semantic approach that modifies, without rejecting, the free variable constraint. Another work with much in common with the proverb theory is <ref> [Rooth, 1981] </ref>. Rooth develops a Montague grammar approach, using the general framework of [Bach and Partee, 1980]. Rooth extends this framework by adding a discourse rule and treats VP ellipsis on an analogy with the quantifying-in rule for NP's.

Reference-contexts: In pseudogapping, the main verb is elided, but the auxiliary is non-elided, and at least one obligatory element in the verb phrase is non-elided. Stripping involves the elision of everything except a single NP. 3 The characterization of conjunction forms draws on work in <ref> [Rooth, 1992; Reinhart, 1991] </ref>. 120 While I have analyzed VP ellipsis as a proform, I will argue that the proform analysis is not appropriate for the related elliptical forms. <p> (69) * The claim that Tom will write books is surprising, but not Harry. 6 Elliptical expressions, I suggest, can be divided into proforms and conjunction forms, based on the following criteria: Proform 4 Examples of this form are discussed in [Lobeck, 1992]. 5 This contrast is pointed out in <ref> [Rooth, 1992] </ref>. 6 The reading of interest here is: Harry will not write books. This reading, which would require non-adjacency, is unavailable. <p> Conjunction forms, on the other hand, do not require access to the discourse model for recovery of missing material. Rather, they must appear in a specific syntactic configuration. The following interpretation mechanism, described in <ref> [Rooth, 1992] </ref>, characterizes the interpretation of conjunction forms 7 : [[ conj remnant ]] ffi = [[ conj ]] ffi ([[]] ffi ; 4 ([[]] f )([[ remnant ]] ffi )) The 4 operator performs lambda-abstraction over focused elements. ffi denotes the ordinary semantic value, while f denotes the focus semantic <p> I won't address the generalization of the conjunction interpretation operation to these forms. The 7 The approach to conjunction forms sketched here is similar in spirit to the analysis of gapping in [Steedman, 1990]. 8 The reader is referred to <ref> [Rooth, 1992] </ref> for a discussion of focus semantic value. 122 interpretation mechanism enforces the constraints on conjunction forms listed above: it places no constraints on semantic type, but it does require adjacency and directionality. In addition, it requires focus on the corresponding elements in the left hand clause (). <p> This suggests that the directionality constraint of the conjunction forms is loosened in the case of pseudogapping. Further work is required to see if the class of elliptical expressions can be divided into conjunction forms and proforms as suggested here. 13 This is discussed by <ref> [Rooth, 1992] </ref> with respect to comparative clauses. 125 7.6 Conclusions In this dissertation I have argued that VP ellipsis is a proverb, and is thus governed by a semantic identity condition.

Reference-contexts: We would expect that a deictic variable within the antecedent VP would not switch referent under ellipsis. The following example shows that this is the case: (78) Speaker A: Do you think they will like me? (79) Speaker B: Yes, I'm sure they will. <ref> [Sag and Hankamer, 1984] </ref> The only possible reading for the elliptical VP is like (Speaker A). <p> As in the present work, a VP occurrence stores a VP meaning, which 6 I am ignoring intensionality in these semantic types. 7 In addition, there are sketches of semantic approaches in [Fodor and Sag, 1982] and <ref> [Sag and Hankamer, 1984] </ref>. 69 can be accessed to resolve an occurrence of VP ellipsis. Also, Rooth's treatment shares with the proverb theory the view that the elliptical VP, as a proform, has no internal syntactic structure. Rooth does not address the free variable constraint.

Reference-contexts: Chapter Five concerns the computational implementation of the system described here. In Chapter Six I describe empirical studies based on data collected from corpora. In Chapter Seven, I discuss related issues and open problems, and draw conclusions. 3 This constraint, described in <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref>, rules out cases in which an anaphor precedesand commands its antecedent. 7 Chapter 2 Evidence for the Proverb Theory 2.1 Overview In this chapter, I present two forms of evidence for the proverb theory of VP ellipsis. <p> Second, I show that the range of antecedence possibilities parallels that of other proforms. I will begin with the issue of sloppy identity: cases in which a pronoun (or other variable) within the antecedent VP is interpreted differently at the ellipsis site. The Sag/Williams account <ref> [Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977] </ref> is based on lambda-abstraction. This account allows a variable to switch from antecedent to ellipsis only if it is -bound; in other words, only a subject-coreferent variable can have a sloppy reading. <p> In the next section, I show that this prediction is false, motivating a generalization of Schema 1. 2.3 Sloppy Readings for Free Pronouns In this section, we see that sloppy readings are possible for free variables, i.e., variables in the antecedent VP that do not corefer with the subject. 1 <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref> points to the following contrast: (2) John said Mary hit him, and Bill did, too. (3) John said Mary hit him, and Bill said she did, too. Sag argues that, while example (2) has both a strict and sloppy reading, example (3) permits only the strict reading. <p> Another example is the following: (44) *Although it doesn't me, it takes Karen a long time to clean the hamster's cage. 8 This is observed in <ref> [Sag, 1976, page 83] </ref>. 18 (45) Although it doesn't always, it sometimes takes a long time to clean the hamster's cage. [Levin, 1985, page 53] Again the wh-trace example patterns with pseudo-gapping: (46) *Although I don't know who it doesn't, it takes Karen a long time to clean the hamster's cage. <p> In view of these examples, it is hard to see how the possible readings can be correlated with the syntactic distinction of subordination vs. coordination. In the account of <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref>, reflexives are treated the same as other variables, such as pronouns, under ellipsis. However, although there may be no categorical syntactic constraint distinguishing reflexives from pronouns under ellipsis, one might still suspect that there is a stronger tendency for reflexives to receive a sloppy reading. <p> In this example, the negation operator licenses the appearance of the NPI any The meaning of example (61) can be represented: (62) NOT 9 x:paper (x).have (Tom,x) 21 Thus, NPI's are analyzed as indefinites, together with a syntactic configurational constraint gov-erning their distribution. As pointed out in <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref>, under ellipsis this constraint is violated. For example: (63) Tom doesn't have any paper. Harry does, though. The meaning of the elliptical sentence is Harry does have some paper. The syntactic copy of the antecedent would result in ungrammaticality 9 : (64) *Harry does have any paper. <p> It has long been recognized that VP ellipsis does not require affixal identity; for example, <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref> cites examples from [Quirk, 1972] such as the following: (3) John understands the situation and surely Peter should. The explanation for this is that the VP node always dominates the base form of verb, and all verbal inflection is under the INFL node. <p> This is not possible for a syntactic reconstruction theory, unless pronoun resolution is treated as syntactic reconstruction as well. 4.3 Lambda Abstraction Approaches 4.3.1 The Sag/Williams Account The Sag/Williams account is developed originally in <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref> and [Williams, 1977]. A similar approach is taken in [Keenan, 1971]. I have described this approach in Chapter Two, and I will briefly recapitulate its main points here. <p> The same problem would arise with any generalization of the lambda abstraction approach. 4.4 Semantic Approaches In the introduction to <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref>, Sag acknowledges that the observations of Webber and others indicate that a semantic identity account is required. Sag develops such an account in [Sag, 1981] 7 . This treatment is broadly consistent with the spirit of the proverb theory. <p> There is one apparent exception to this rule, when VPE is within an NP argument to V. This illustrated by the following example: (8) Sandy [hit [everyone that Bill [did]. V P E ] N P ] V P . <ref> [Sag, 1976] </ref> Here, the antecedent does appear to be the VP headed by hit. 10 Be/Do Conflicts If there is a be-form in the antecedent VP, with a do-form VPE, VP is not a possible antecedent. <p> As discussed in Chapter Two, the proverb theory requires a pseudogapping analysis of these structures, since there would otherwise be a wh-trace within the ellipsis site 12 . It is not clear 11 See <ref> [Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977; May, 1985] </ref> for the analysis of antecedent-contained VP deletion. 12 See [Lappin and McCord, 1990] for arguments for a pseudogapping analysis of antecedent-contained deletion structures. [Jacobson, 1992] also proposes a treatment along these lines, in a categorial grammar framework. 124 how to apply the conjunction operation to

Reference-contexts: Since these can be separated by arbitrary amounts of material, this conflicts with the normal restriction of syntactic constraints to a single sentence. Another way of ruling out the missing reading is suggested by <ref> [Sim, ] </ref>. This approach does not require syntactic reconstruction or intersentential constraints. However, it does rely on an implicit weakening of the identity condition, in that a variable within the antecedent is treated differently at the ellipsis site than within the antecedent.

Reference-contexts: Ward, 1991], where it is argued that the structural constraints of the sort described in Schema 1 are merely tendencies that can be overridden by intonational and contextual factors. 14 (16) China is a country that Joe wants to visit e, and he will too, if he gets enough money. <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> The antecedent VP is visit e, where e denotes a wh-trace. The ellipsis site is not within the relative clause. Thus the above example would be ungrammatical if a syntactic representation of the antecedent were copied to the ellipsis site, since the trace would not be bound. <p> Thus (70) is represented: [Martha and Irv] [ DIST [ x.want (x,dance (x,y))] V P ] V P Consider now the following example: (71) Martha and Irv wanted to dance with each other, but Martha couldn't, because her husband was here. <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> In this example, the syntactic antecedent dance with each other is not be possible at the ellipsis site: (72) * Martha couldn't dance with each other. However, the example can be readily explained by reference to the semantic representation given above. <p> Consider the following example: (94) Wendy is eager to sail around the world and Bruce is eager to climb Kilimanjaro, but neither of them can because money is too tight. <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> 29 The reading of interest is that Wendy cannot sail around the world, and Bruce cannot climb Kilimanjaro. Clearly, this reading will not be permitted by syntactically copying either of the preceding VP's to the ellipsis site; a combination of the two VP's is required. <p> This is a natural and independently motivated operation, needed to account for plural pronouns such as them in example (94). Another example is the following: (96) I can walk, and I can chew gum. Gerry can too, but not at the same time. <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> Here the elliptical VP is a predicate combined from walk and chew gum. Here is a naturally-occurring example: (97) So I say to the conspiracy fans: leave him alone. Leave us alone. <p> However, it retains the use of the lambda abstraction mechanism to explain sloppy identity. I briefly describe two important critiques of the lambda abstraction approach: first, <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> gives numerous examples which cannot be handled by the lambda abstraction approach. <p> However, this would represent a radical departure for the equational approach, since the solution to the equation would no longer represent merely the elided material. 67 4.3.3 Two Critiques of Lambda Abstraction Approaches Webber <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> gives several examples which are problematic for lambda abstraction approaches. Many of these examples have been discussed in Chapters Two and Three; I repeat one here: (22) China is a country that Joe wants to visit e, and he will too, if he gets enough money. [Webber, 1978] Webber <p> Approaches Webber <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> gives several examples which are problematic for lambda abstraction approaches. Many of these examples have been discussed in Chapters Two and Three; I repeat one here: (22) China is a country that Joe wants to visit e, and he will too, if he gets enough money. [Webber, 1978] Webber argues that examples of this sort show that VP ellipsis cannot be described as syntactic identity, and suggests that the resolution mechanism sometimes involves inference. <p> Consider again example (94), repeated below: (20) Wendy is eager to sail around the world and Bruce is eager to climb Kilimanjaro, but neither of them can because money is too tight. <ref> [Webber, 1978] </ref> The subject of the elliptical VP neither of them itself has a split antecedent, and the two antecedents are the subjects of the VP's which must be combined.

Reference-contexts: Cases involving a wh-operator are particularly interesting with respect to the question of syntactic vs. semantic identity, since wh-variables are governed by well-known syntactic constraints. I will show that these syntactic constraints are not respected under ellipsis. Consider the following example: 6 Examples violating Schema 1 due to <ref> [Wescoat, 1989] </ref> are discussed in [Dalrymple et al., 1991], such as: The policeman who arrested John failed to read him his rights, and so did the one who arrested Bill. 7 This generalization is consistent with the results of a psycholinguistic study described by [Hirschberg and Ward, 1991], where it is <p> To see this, consider the Equational analysis of the following example [Dalrymple et al., 1991, pages 20-21]: 68 (23) The person who introduced Mary to John would not give her his phone number, nor would the person who introduced Sue to Bill. <ref> [Wescoat, 1989] </ref> [Dalrymple et al., 1991] present the following equation for this example: P (pwi (m,j),m,j) = refuse (pwi (m,j),give (m,phone (j))) Solving for P results in the following semantic object: x. y. z.refuse (x,give (y,phone (z))) Here, the missing object corresponding to the elided VP is a three-place relation, that
