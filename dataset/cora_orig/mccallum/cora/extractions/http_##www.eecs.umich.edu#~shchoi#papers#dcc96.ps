Abstract: A Genetic Algorithmic (GA) approach to vector quantizer design that combines the conventional Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (GLA) [6] is presented. We refer to this hybrid as the Genetic Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (GGLA). It works briefly as follows: A finite number of codebooks, called chromosomes, are selected. Each codebook undergoes iterative cycles of reproduction. We perform experiments with various alternative design choices using Gaussian-Markov processes, speech, and image as source data and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the performance measure. In most cases, the GGLA showed performance improvements with respect to the GLA. We also compare our results with the Zador-Gersho formula [2, 9].

Reference-contexts: Given an initial codebook, the algorithm leads to the nearest local optimum codebook, which may not be globally optimal. Genetic algorithms (GA) are emerging as widely accepted optimization and search methods <ref> [1, 4, 5] </ref>. These search methods are rooted in the mechanisms of evolution and natural genetics. They have a high probability of locating the globally optimal solution in a multi-modal search space.

Reference-contexts: We experimented with different design choices for genetic algorithms and compare their performances with the GLA using Gaussian-Markov processes, speech, and image as source data and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the performance measure. We also compare the results with the Zador-Gersho formula <ref> [2, 9] </ref>, which is widely accepted as a benchmark for VQ performance. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the design of our hybrid genetic plus generalized Lloyd algorithm which includes the chromosome representations, genetic operators, and operator selection schemes. <p> described in Sec. 3.1 and used for the other sources, performs worse than this random codebook generation scheme especially for the speech source even though the latter one does not work better compared with the GLA. 3.4 Zador-Gersho formula Finally, we compare the experimental results with the Zador-Gersho (Z-G) formula <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. The Z-G formula is a well-known benchmark for VQ performance, and is accurate for R & 3.

We implemented three versions of genetic algorithms for the codebook design problem combined with the GLA. They are collectively called the Genetic Generalized Lloyd Algorithms (GGLA) and the three versions are referred to as GGLA-I, GGLA-II and GGLA-III.
