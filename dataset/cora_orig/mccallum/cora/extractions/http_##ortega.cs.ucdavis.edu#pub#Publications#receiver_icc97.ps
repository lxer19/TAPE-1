Abstract: Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) has the ability to utilize the enormous bandwidth offered by optical networks using today's electronics. We present an approximate analytical solution for the average packet delay in a local light-wave network, which employs the Multicast Scheduling Algorithm (MSA) [4] as its medium-access control (MAC) protocol. First, we develop an approximate analytical solution for the probability distribution of the receiver busy time. We demonstrate and explain some interesting and unobvious behavior of this distribution. Then, using the receiver busy time distribution, we calculate the maximum receiver throughput and the average packet delay. Results from the analytical solution match very well with those obtained from simulation.

Reference-contexts: Transmissions on different channels (or wavelengths) never collide. For transmissions on the same channel, there will not be a collision as long as the transmissions from different nodes pass through the PSC at different times.
