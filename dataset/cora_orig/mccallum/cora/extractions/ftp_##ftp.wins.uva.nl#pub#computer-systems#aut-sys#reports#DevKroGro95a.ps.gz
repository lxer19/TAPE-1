Abstract: The reconstruction of the observer motion and environment structure from optic flow is considered for the case where the camera mapping is unknown. This mapping has therefore to be estimated from a given set of examples, the training set. Since this mapping is not a function in the sense of a many to one mapping, standard neural networks are unable to learn this mapping. We propose to represent these mappings from X ! Y as a manifold in the product space X fi Y. We approximate a parameterization of the manifold from a given set of data points by using an auto associative neural network with a bottleneck layer. A gradient descent algorithm is used on the parameterization of the learned manifold to find the approximation of the ego-motion (and scene structure) for a given set of optic flow vectors. We demonstrate this on a unit perspective camera mapping.
