Abstract: This paper studies the global asymptotic stability of a class of LTI switching systems. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the stability of these systems are given and it is shown that under the sufficient condition, a common Lyapunov function exists for the LTI sub-systems. A particular case when the system matrices can be simultaneously transformed to normal matrices is shown to correspond to the existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function. A constructive procedure to check the possibility of simultaneous transformation to normal matrices is provided. Key Words: Asymptotic Stability, Switching systems, Normal matrices, Common Lyapunov function

From Section 7.2 in [5] , (E) is a continuous function of the elements of E. <p> Now 8E t (k) 2 E k t , = S 1 i k (t k ) i 2 (t 2 ) i 1 (t 1 )S 4 kS 1 i k (t k ) i 2 (t 2 ) i 1 (t 1 )Sk from Theorem 5:6:9 in <ref> [1] </ref> kS 1 i k (t k )SkkS 1 i 2 (t 2 )SkkS 1 i 1 (t 1 )Sk k t from (7) and (8) Hence 8t t k t ! 0 as k ! 1. Hence the switching system is asymptotically stable. <p> Comment 1 : A convenient matrix norm that can be used in (6) is the spectral norm kk sp = () and is induced from the euclidean vector norm. ( See 5.5.6 in <ref> [1] </ref>). Hence, in particular, Theorem 4.1 reduces to the existence of a nonsingular S such that (S 1 AS) &lt; 1; 8A 2 A. In this case the common Lyapunov function in Theorem 4.2 can be chosen to be quadratic. This is expressed in the following theorem. <p> If M is normal, (M ) &lt; 1, (M ) = (M ) &lt; 1, thereby satisfying the constraint mentioned in the above Comment. A normal matrix M is characterised by M M fl = M fl M (See Section 2.5, <ref> [1] </ref>). Thus the spectral radius is a norm on Normal matrices. The interest is now on conditions so that i is normal. The following theorem expresses necessary and sufficient conditions on A i so that i is normal. <p> Proof Let the matrices A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : A N commute pairwise. Then the matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable (Theorem 1.3.12, <ref> [1] </ref>) and hence simultaneously normalizable. The switching system then is evidently stable by Theorem 5.1. To see this, the matrices are now pairwise diagonalizable (Theorem 1.3.12, [1]) and let S ij be the transformation which diagonalises both A i and A j . Here, S ij = S ji . <p> Then the matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable (Theorem 1.3.12, <ref> [1] </ref>) and hence simultaneously normalizable. The switching system then is evidently stable by Theorem 5.1. To see this, the matrices are now pairwise diagonalizable (Theorem 1.3.12, [1]) and let S ij be the transformation which diagonalises both A i and A j . Here, S ij = S ji . The claim is that any of these S ij will simultaneously diagonalise all the matrices A i ; i = 1 : : : N .

Reference-contexts: One of the first questions to be answered in this context is the stability of the switching system. It is well-known that the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the sub-sytem A-matrices <ref> [2] </ref>, is a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of a switching system in the sense of Lyapunov. In [4], a sufficient condition for the stability of a switching system is provided which gives a constructional procedure for the common quadratic Lyapunov function. <p> Hence the matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable. 5 Conclusions Stability of a LTI switching system has been considered in the asymptotic sense. A necessary condition for the global asymptotic stability which generalises a result reported in <ref> [2] </ref> is given. A sufficient condition is also provided here for the global asymptotic stability of the system. A particular case of this sufficient condition, simultaneous normalization of the system matrices, is considered and a constructive procedure to check for simultaneous normalization is developed.

Reference-contexts: A matrix A is said to be normalizable if there exists nonsingular S such that S 1 AS is normal . From <ref> [3] </ref>, S is necessarily of the form S = T A U where T A is a modal matrix of A and U is a Unitary matrix. Let N A = fS 1 AS : S = T A U ; U unitaryg. <p> Also M A M T A M A = I. From Theorem 4 and Corollary 1 in <ref> [3] </ref> we have Theorem 4.2 Let A and B be two normalizable matrices. Then they are simultaneously normalizable iff T A T fl A = T B T fl B . <p> This condition simplifies to (14) since D = K 1 The procedure of verifying the satisfiability of Theorem 5.1 is summarised below in two steps. Step 1 checks for pairwise normalization of the matrices as in <ref> [3] </ref> and Step 2 which is carried out upon the success of Step 1, checks for additional constraints on the similarity transformations S ij so that simultaneous normalization of the matrices is achieved: Step 1 The matrices A i ; i = 1 : : : N are checked for pairwise <p> This is done as in <ref> [3] </ref>. The conditions for pairwise normalization of two matrices, say, A l 1 and A l 2 is exposited below.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the sub-sytem A-matrices [2], is a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of a switching system in the sense of Lyapunov. In <ref> [4] </ref>, a sufficient condition for the stability of a switching system is provided which gives a constructional procedure for the common quadratic Lyapunov function. This paper discusses some necessary and some sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of a switching system. <p> In this case the sub-systems have a common quadratic Lyapunov function. Also, a constructional procedure to check whether the theorem's premise is satisfied is provided. An example illustrates the procedure. This result can be viewed as a generalisation of the result in <ref> [4] </ref>, a sufficient condition for stability of switching systems. The authors were motivated by an analogous result while considering asymptotic stability of fuzzy systems. It can be shown that as regards stability, a fuzzy system and a corresponding switching system are equivalent. <p> Thus the matrices are simultaneously normalizable and hence the corresponding switching system is stable. Comment 4 : Simultaneous normalization can be thought of as an extension of simultaneous diagonalization of the matrices since diagonal matrices are normal. This case has been studied in <ref> [4] </ref> as a class of commuting matrices and the basic result in [4] is elucidated below: Theorem 4.5 If the matrices A i ; i = 1 : : : N commute pairwise , then the switching system (1) is stable. <p> Comment 4 : Simultaneous normalization can be thought of as an extension of simultaneous diagonalization of the matrices since diagonal matrices are normal.
