Abstract: David Payton and Ken Rosenblatt have recently proposed a command fusion method for combining outputs of multiple behaviors in a mobile robot navigation system such that information loss due to command fusion can be reduced. Using linguistic fuzzy rules to explicitly capture heuristics implicit in the Payton-Rosenblatt approach, we have extended their approach to a fuzzy logic architecture for mobile Published in: IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Vol 25, No. 6, pp. 971-978, June 1995.

Reference-contexts: The major limitation of purely sensor-based approaches is that the robot my not reach the goal, even if a path to the goal exists. Model-based approaches and sensor-based approaches can be combined into hybrid approaches to mobile robot navigation <ref> [1] </ref>. As shown in Figure 2, a hybrid approach usually uses a model-based planner to generate a path from an incomplete model of the environment. The path is used by a sensor-based controller to navigate the robot such that it follows the path while avoiding obstacles unknown to the model. <p> Payton and Rosenblatt's Command Fusion Network In the November/December 1990 issue of IEEE Transactions of Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, David Payton, Ken Rosenblatt and David Keirsey presented an approach for combining control commands of multiple behaviors for an autonomous mobile robot <ref> [1] </ref>. The approach is motivated by their observation that a fixed-priority-based command arbitration usually results in loss of information, which makes decision making much more difficult, as illustrated by the example situation in Figure 1. <p> The confidence and desirability of each control decision is represented by the activation level of the node. To illustrate this, Figure 3 (which duplicates Figure 7 in <ref> [1] </ref>) shows a P-R network for combining two behaviors, Turn-for-Obstacle and Track-Road-Edges, for the situation given in Figure 1. The size and color of each node in Figure 3 represents the behaviors' activation for that command. A node's size represents the magnitude of its activation.

Reference-contexts: Sensor based approaches to mobile robot navigation generate control commands based on sensor data. A promising architecture for sensor-based approaches is the behavioral architecture, which consists of multiple behaviors, each one of which reacts to sensor input based on a particular concern of the navigation controller <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. Examples of typical behaviors include goal-attraction, wall-following, and obstacle-avoidance. The main advantage of sensor-based approaches is that the robot can navigate safely in a dynamic environment, because it can easily react to obstacles detected by sensors in real-time.

Reference-contexts: In each control cycle, all fuzzy rules are fired and combined to obtain a fuzzy conclusion for each control variable. Each fuzzy conclusion is then defuzzified, resulting in a final crisp control command. An overview of a fuzzy logic controller and its applications can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. Other researchers have also applied fuzzy logic to mobile robot navigation with different focus. Ruspini and his colleagues have developed a fuzzy logic based approach to the explicit representation and execution of complex navigation plan, which was implemented in SRI's award winning robot Flaky [12].

Relationship between Payton-Rosenblatt Approach and Fuzzy Logic Even though Payton and Rosenblatt's (P-R) method was not presented as a fuzzy logic approach, it is similar to fuzzy systems in several ways. First, the activation level of nodes in the P-R network corresponds to membership degrees in fuzzy sets.

Reference-contexts: B. Path Following Behavior The path following behavior generates a desired turning direction based on the robot's current location, its current heading and an imperfect path generated from an incomplete and uncertain model of the environment using a simplified road map type method <ref> [14] </ref>. The path following behavior determines the desired turning direction in three steps. First, it locates a target point, which serves as a near term goal, by projecting forward along the path for a predetermined distance d starting from the point on the 10 path closest to the robot.

Reference-contexts: Based on the result 2 In a recent study on the stability of fuzzy controllers, it has been shown that this is actually a desirable property for analyzing the stability of fuzzy systems <ref> [15] </ref>. 11 of the comparison, the behavior determines the degree to which the general direction of the sensor is considered disallowed. Examples of fuzzy rules used by the obstacle avoidance behavior are shown in with respect to 45 degrees.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate this difficulty, we have developed a new defuzzification method, called Centroid of Largest Area (CLA), that partitions a multiple-peak fuzzy command into several disjoint fuzzy subsets, each corresponding to a feasible fuzzy command <ref> [16] </ref>. The fuzzy subset with the largest area is then selected and defuzzified using the COA method. This new defuzzification technique is illustrated in Figure 13. The twin-peak fuzzy control command is partitioned into two fuzzy subsets, one corresponding to each feasible fuzzy command.
