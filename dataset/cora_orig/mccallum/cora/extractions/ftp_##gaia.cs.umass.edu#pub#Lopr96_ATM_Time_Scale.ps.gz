Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of resource allocation and control for an ATM node with regulated traffic. Both guaranteed lossless service and statistical service with small loss probability are considered. We investigate the relationship between source characteristics and the buffer/bandwidth trade-off under both services. Our contributions are the following. For guaranteed lossless service, we find that the optimal resource allocation scheme suggests a time scale separation of sources sharing an ATM node with finite bandwidth and buffer space, with the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is determined by the sources' time scale. For statistical service with a small loss probability, we present a new approach for estimating the loss probability in a shared buffer multiplexor with the so called extremal on-off, periodic sources. Under this approach, the optimal resource allocation for statistical service is achieved by maximizing both the benefits of buffering sharing and bandwidth sharing. The optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is again determined by time scale separation. Besides their obvious application to resource allocation and call admission control, our results have many other implications in network design and control such as network dimensioning and traffic shaping.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Resource allocation is an extremely challenging and important problem in the design and control of high-speed networks such as ATM networks. The problem is particularly complicated by the need to support Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees for a variety of applications with very diverse traffic characteristics. In <ref> [EMW95] </ref>, a new approach to resource allocation in an ATM node with fixed bandwidth and a finite, shared buffer is presented. <p> This reduction is made possible by introducing the concept of a virtual buffer/trunk system and establishing the exchangeability of buffer and bandwidth. Based on the analytical results, a qualitative theory is then described which provides many insights in call admission control. Motivated and inspired by the work in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>, we study source characteristics and their impact on buffer/bandwidth trade-off in the design and control of an ATM node. The starting point of our approach is the examination of optimal resource allocation schemes for guaranteed lossless service. <p> For statistical service where a small loss probability is allowed, we derive a new approach to estimate the loss probability using our results for the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off obtained for lossless service. By giving a new interpretation to the virtual trunk/buffer systems introduced in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>, we are able to transform the two-resource allocation problem into two independent single-resource allocation problems. The best buffer/bandwidth separation is explored by optimizing resource allocation along the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off curve. <p> Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that source time scales also have a major impact on the optimal resource allocation under statistical service, and the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is again reflected by the source time scale separation. Our work differs from <ref> [EMW95] </ref> in several aspects. First, our perspectives on resource allocation and control problems are somewhat different. The authors in [EMW95] are primarily interested in call admission control. This is reflected in their fixing the system bandwidth C and buffer space B. <p> Our work differs from <ref> [EMW95] </ref> in several aspects. First, our perspectives on resource allocation and control problems are somewhat different. The authors in [EMW95] are primarily interested in call admission control. This is reflected in their fixing the system bandwidth C and buffer space B. Resource allocation to each source is independent of the sources' characteristics. <p> This is important, as the efficacy of buffer sharing and that of bandwidth sharing for sources with different time scales are quite different. Numerical examples indicate that our approach provides a better estimate of the system loss probability than <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We start with the optimal resource allocation problem for guaranteed lossless service in Section 2, and demonstrate the relationship between source time scale and optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off. <p> In Section 4, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the relationship between source time scale and buffer/bandwidth trade-off. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated and comparison with the results in <ref> [EMW95] </ref> is also made. The paper is concluded in Section 5. 2 Guaranteed Lossless Service The starting point of our study is the analysis of the optimal resource allocation scheme for guaranteed lossless service. Consider an ATM node with a total amount of bandwidth C and buffer space B. <p> In this section, we explore the possibility of exploiting statistical multiplexing gains by considering statistical service with small loss probabilities. Statistical multiplexing gains can be extracted by exploiting the bursty nature and statistical independence of traffic sources <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. To exploit the bursty nature of traffic sources regulated by leaky buckets with parameters 9 (; ; P ), we follow [EMW95] and assume that the regulated sources after passing through leaky bucket regulators are extremal on-off, periodic processes (see Figure 4), where, when a source is active, it generates <p> Statistical multiplexing gains can be extracted by exploiting the bursty nature and statistical independence of traffic sources <ref> [EMW95] </ref>.

Then S = P T on = P P . S is known as the source burst-size. In order to model the statistical independence of traffic sources, we introduce indeterminate phases to the sources as in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. Assume that traffic sources are grouped into J classes, and for 1 j J , there are K j sources in class j, P J j=1 K j = N . <p> However, the loss probability of such a two-resource system with the given on-off sources is very difficult to compute directly. Several bounding and approximate approaches has been developed [KB92, NRST91, RV89, RV91], based on the so-called Benes approach [Be63].

Based on the work of [EMW95], in this section, we present a new approach to the problem of estimating system loss probability by transforming the two-resource problem into two independent single-resource problems which allows us to explore the optimal trade-off between buffer and bandwidth. <p> This reduction is achieved via a virtual lossless segregate system functioning as a resource separator, a new interpretation of the notion of the virtual buffer/trunk system introduced in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. The rest of this section is organized as follows. In Section 3.1, we introduce the concept of virtual buffer/trunk system. In Section 3.2, we describe our approach for determining the optimal buffer/bandwidth separation and trade-off. <p> Suppose it is allocated a trunk of bandwidth of c where c P . Then the maximum backlog at the virtual circuit is b = T on (c ) = T on (P c). Hence if the virtual circuit is allocated buffer space b, no losses will occur. Following <ref> [EMW95] </ref>, we call such a virtual circuit a virtual buffer/trunk system. Let u (t) and v (t) denote, respectively, the utilized bandwidth and the buffer content of the virtual circuit at time t. <p> In comparison to previous works that consider multiplexing of periodic on-off sources <ref> [EMW95, GBC95, KB92, NRST91, RV89, RV91] </ref>, an important contribution of our present work lies in exploiting the different sources times scales existing in heterogeneous traffic sources. <p> For statistical service, the resulting admissible region is also clearly non-linear. We can distinguish two distinct components in the boundary: a linear region for K 1 45 and a concave region otherwise. We now compare our approach with that in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. In [EMW95] the system loss probability is estimated by reducing the two-resource allocation problem into a single resource allocation problem by fixing the buffer/bandwidth trade-off to the ratio B=C regardless of sources characteristics. We extend their approach by transforming the two-resource allocation problem into two independent resource allocation problems. <p> For statistical service, the resulting admissible region is also clearly non-linear.

As a consequence our loss probability estimate (21) that explores the best resource separation is expected to provide better results than the approach in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. This has been confirmed by our numerical investigations. As an example, we compare our results in 19 their case, so our class 1 corresponds to class 2 in [EMW95] and vice versa. <p> our loss probability estimate (21) that explores the best resource separation is expected to provide better results than the approach in <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. This has been confirmed by our numerical investigations. As an example, we compare our results in 19 their case, so our class 1 corresponds to class 2 in [EMW95] and vice versa. In Figure 15, we plot the admissible region obtained using both approaches, for loss probabilities of 10 9 and 10 5 . The bandwidth and buffer size are fixed to C = 45 Mbps and B = 1000 cells, respectively. <p> In Table 2, we list the numbers of class 1 admissible sources, K 1 , obtained from simulation and our numerical approach for various loss probabilities, where C = 45Mbps and B = 1000 cells. The simulations results are taken from <ref> [EMW95] </ref>. As expected, our approach provides a conservative estimate of number of admissible sources when compared with simulation. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we studied the problem of resource allocation and control for an ATM node with regulated traffic.
