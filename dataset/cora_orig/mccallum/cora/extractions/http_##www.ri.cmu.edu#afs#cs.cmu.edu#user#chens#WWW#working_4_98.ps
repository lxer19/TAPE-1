Reference-contexts: Assortment is combination--it should be possible for two non-competing schemata, one from each parent, to both survive in the offspring. However, previous experiments have shown that transmission and assortment can handicap the performance of heuristic operators for non-standard representations <ref> [CS98] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid Operators for the Travelling Salesman Problem This experiment studies three 2-opt-based hybrid operators for the Travelling Salesman Problem: CST/NN-2-Opt, GX-2-Opt [JSG89], and Random Respectful Recombination-Binomial Minimal Mutation (RRR-BMM) [RS94]. (Note: BMM is equivalent to 2-opt for RRR, and RRR-BMM is equivalent to the operator used in CHC <ref> [Esh91] </ref>.) Since 2-opt is held constant as the local optimizer, the experiments will isolate the contribution of CST/NN (a commonality-based crossover operator), GX (a combination-based operator), and RRR (an operator that is incapable of finding good solutions independently).

Reference-contexts: The Greedy Crossover (GX) <ref> [GGR85] </ref> creates an offspring by combining short edges taken from the parents. The most effective version of GX starts with a random element and builds the tour by picking the shortest edge from either parent that does not introduce a cycle.

Reference-contexts: effects on schemata of these procedures are described by the Schema Theorem. 2.1.1 The Original Form If at time t, there are m instances of a particular schema H in the population A (t), we expect (2.1) instances in the next generation (at time ) when using roulette wheel selection <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. At this point, the allocation of these trials is done by merely copying the solutions, so no search is performed. The crossover operator is a structured, randomized method to exchange information among strings. <p> Since each solution represents 2 l schemata, information is gained on all 2 l schemata with each evaluation. Overall, it has been estimated that a population of n solutions usefully processes O (n 3 ) schemata each generation <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. This computational leverage (believed to be unique to genetic algorithms) has been called implicit parallelism. Implicit parallelism heavily inuences the design of crossover operators.

Reference-contexts: In this experiment, one-point and two-point crossover have similar performance when using generational replacement, but uniform crossover performs significantly worse. However, when using steady-state replacement like Syswerda, uniform crossover again outperforms two-point crossover which itself outperforms one-point crossover. Overall, this experiment confirms the results in <ref> [GS94] </ref>. The performance of uniform crossover is clearly enhanced by using steady 1. In a steady-state GA, this figure is accurate for only the first few generations. After convergence, the offspring of uniform crossover also average 100% of the fitness of their parents. 7 state replacement.

Reference-contexts: Background The Schema Theorem, or the Fundamental Theorem of Genetic Algorithms, significantly inu-ences the design of crossover operators. Before addressing these inuences, it is useful to review the development of the Schema Theorem. 2.1 The Schema Theorem The genetic algorithm first developed by Holland <ref> [Hol75] </ref> consisted of binary string solutions, a generational replacement scheme, roulette wheel parent selection, and the one-point crossover and mutate operator.

(Note: BMM is equivalent to 2-opt for RRR, and RRR-BMM is equivalent to the operator used in CHC [Esh91].)

Reference-contexts: However, this statement only addresses how efficiently local optimizers are used. Since it has been shown that locally-optimal solutions are more similar to each other than are random solutions, and that the better the solutions are, the more similar they are <ref> [Mh91] </ref>, exploiting commonality in hybrid operators may lead to more effective use of local optimizers. The remainder of this paper pursues this hypothesis. First, the original Schema Theorem and some of its implications are reviewed in section 2. In section 3, a new commonality-based Schema Theorem is developed. <p> One characteristic of a good start point is that it is a solution of reasonable quality. This increases the efficiency of the local optimizer [UPL91]. A second characteristic of a good start point is that it leads to a good final solution. Since good solutions are highly similar <ref> [Mh91] </ref>, it is reasonable to search in the neighborhood of (good) parent solutions. A well designed commonality-based crossover operator is more likely to provide a start point that is in the neighborhood of good solutions.

Reference-contexts: This is, after all, the overt purpose of crossover. [Sys89], Radcliffe, Given instances of two compatible [schemata], it should be possible to cross them to produce a child which is an instance of both [schemata]. <ref> [Rad91] </ref>, and Davis, ... the benefits of crossover ... is that crossover acts to combine building blocks of good solutions from diverse chromosomes. [Dav91]. 2.3 Adding Commonality to Combination For standard crossover operators, it has been observed that common schemata are unconditionally propagated to the offspring. <p> Suggesting that non-standard crossover operators should also preserve common schemata, commonality and combination receive equal treatment in Radcliffes three design principles: respect, transmission, and assortment <ref> [Rad91] </ref>. Respect is an equivalent notion to commonality--two parents that have a schema H in common should produce an offspring that also has schema H. Transmission is similar to non-disruptive--schemata in the offspring should come from one of the parents.

Reference-contexts: It shows that schemata of low order and short defining lengths receive a minimal amount of disruption to the allocation strategy established by fitness-based selection. 2.1.2 Commonality-Based Extensions Focusing strictly on the effects of crossover, an extension of the Schema Theorem has been made to account for common schemata <ref> [Sch87] </ref>. A genetic algorithm without mutation has the following effect on a schema H: (2.4) , where is the fitness ratio, and is the proportion of schema H in the population at time t.

Reference-contexts: The concept of combination has received heavy re-emphasis in the literature. Reinforcing views include Syswerda, ... the next step is to combine [good schemata] together in one genome. This is, after all, the overt purpose of crossover. <ref> [Sys89] </ref>, Radcliffe, Given instances of two compatible [schemata], it should be possible to cross them to produce a child which is an instance of both [schemata]. [Rad91], and Davis, ... the benefits of crossover ... is that crossover acts to combine building blocks of good solutions from diverse chromosomes. [Dav91]. 2.3 <p> This idea was hypothesized (but not confirmed) by Syswerda who thought that his experimental result which showed uniform crossover to outperform both one-point and two-point crossover may have been partially caused by the use of a steady-state (vs. a generational) replacement scheme <ref> [Sys89] </ref>. To isolate this hypothesis, an objective function highly susceptible to disruption was designed. In a solution string of 100 bits that is decomposed into 25 blocks of 4 bits each, the fitness increases by 1 if a block is complete--all 1s or 0s.

Reference-contexts: In hybrid operators, crossover solutions are locally optimized before they are added to the population. Compared with random multi-start, crossover accelerates the search because it provides intermediate solutions of higher quality which the local optimizer can process in less time <ref> [UPL91] </ref>. However, this statement only addresses how efficiently local optimizers are used. <p> The role of crossover in a hybrid operator is not necessarily to find good solutions, but to find good start points. One characteristic of a good start point is that it is a solution of reasonable quality. This increases the efficiency of the local optimizer <ref> [UPL91] </ref>. A second characteristic of a good start point is that it leads to a good final solution. Since good solutions are highly similar [Mh91], it is reasonable to search in the neighborhood of (good) parent solutions.

Reference-contexts: Multiplying out, the effect on schema H is (2.5) . Compared to (2.4), the bias in crossover towards disrupting long schemata is reduced for above-average schemata. 2.1.3 The Steady-State Form Another revision occurs when switching to a steady-state genetic algorithm <ref> [WS90] </ref>. Instead of creating a new generation of offspring that replaces all of the parents, offspring are added one-at-a-time 2 to the population, and each new offspring replaces the lowest-ranking member of the population. This process builds in elitism--the best solutions always survive.
