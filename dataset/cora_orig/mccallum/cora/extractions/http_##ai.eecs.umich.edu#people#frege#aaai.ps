Title: An Organizational Self-Design Model for Organizational Change  
Author: Young-pa So and Edmund H. Durfee 
Address: Ann Arbor, MI 48109  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of Michigan  
Abstract: Organizational Self-Design (OSD) is a model of Organizational Change from the perspective of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). We present a top-down model of OSD in the context of Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving (CDPS). We emphasize the task environment as an important factor in determining an effective organizational structure. We provide an example of an analytical model of organization performance for an addition task using tree structure organizations, and show how such model can be used to endow a Distributed Network Mangement system with the capability to adapt to changing task environments via OSD.
