Abstract: We define a general method for ranking the solutions of a search process by associating costs with equivalence classes of state transitions of the process. We show how the method can accommodate models based on probabilistic, discriminative, and distance cost functions and provide a means for assigning costs to unseen events that is applicable to all three models. By applying the method to our machine translation prototype, we are able to experiment with different cost functions and training procedures. These include the use of an unsupervised procedure for training the numerical parameters of our English-Chinese translation model. We present performance results from these experiments, showing that the choice of cost function leads to significant differences in translation quality.

Reference-contexts: The distance function is such that the greater the number it yields, the worse the solution is; it is zero for ideal solutions. One simple type of model based on distance functions is the mean distance model <ref> (Alshawi and Carter 1994) </ref>. Given a set of solutions resulting from executions of a process, the parameters of the mean distance model are E h (ejc); the average of h (s; t) for source-solution pairs s-t produced by a sequence of events including e in context c.

Reference-contexts: After implementing the handling of costed events in a more general way, we experimented with distance-based models. 7 There have been a number of attempts at training probabilistic translation models from ex-amples produced by human translators, notably automatically aligned corpora of parliamentary proceedings <ref> (Brown et al. 1990, Wu 1995) </ref>. Given a set of pairs of translated examples, we can define a function for a distance-based model in our framework in terms of a string distance metric d between arbitrary sentences of the target language.

Reference-contexts: Monolingual analysis and generation components analyze and generate, respectively, dependency graphs like those employed in various forms of dependency grammar <ref> (Hudson 1984) </ref>. These graphs express syntactic or semantic relations holding between the words of a sentence or phrase. The nodes of the graph are labeled with words and the arcs with relation symbols. A transfer component maps dependency graphs with source-language words into corresponding graphs with target-language words.

Reference-contexts: We contrast our costed event framework to the related effort toward providing a set of tools for processing weighted automata <ref> (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994) </ref>. The weighted-automata tools provide algorithms for manipulating labeled, weighted, state transition networks. In our approach, we further separate the algorithmic issues from those relating to cost manipulation.
