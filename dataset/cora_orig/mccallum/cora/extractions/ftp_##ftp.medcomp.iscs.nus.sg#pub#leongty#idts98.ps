Abstract: We propose an approach to computer-aided model construction that builds on the concept of causal mechanisms. Causal mechanisms are local interactions among domain variables that are usually fairly well understood and model independent, hence can be reused in different models. Their algebraic descriptions are known as structural equations. A model composed of causal mechanisms is causal and intuitive for human users. It also supports predictions of the effect of external interventions (decisions). We discuss issues related to storage and maintenance of causal mechanisms and interactive model building, including treatment of reversible causal mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: A popular criterion for success in model building is whether a model is "requisite," i.e., whether it contains everything that is essential for solving the problem and whether any new insights about the problem will emerge by elaborating on it <ref> (Clemen 1996) </ref>. A paraphrase on Einstein's quote (originally applied to scientific theories) "a model should be as simple as possible but not simpler" illustrates to a degree the subjective notion of what a good model is and how much of model building process is formalized.

Reference-contexts: While obtaining model parameters, i.e., prior and conditional probability distributions, has received much attention in behavioral decision theory literature (see von Winterfeldt and Ed-wards (1988) for a review) and in artificial intelligence <ref> (Druzdzel & van der Gaag 1995) </ref>, relatively little work has been done on composing model structure.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, there are strong indications that the quality of advice coming from decision-theoretic models is more sensitive to the model structure than to the precision of its numerical parameters <ref> (Pradhan et al. 1996) </ref>. Most previous approaches to aiding model building took the path of automatic model construction by a computer program. Wellman et al. (1992) stress the need to combine previous domain knowledge with problem description and observed information.

Reference-contexts: Often, especially in systems studied in social sciences, a mechanism is not as transparent. Instead, one often has other clues or well-developed and empirically tested theories of interactions in the system that are based on elementary laws like "no action at a distance" or "no action without communication" <ref> (Simon 1977, page 52) </ref>. Structural equations may be formed entirely on the basis of a theory or consist of principles derived from observations, knowledge of legal and institutional rules restricting the system (such as tax schedules, prices, or pollution controls), technological knowledge, physical, chemical, or social laws.
