Abstract: This paper presents an approach for defining evaluation criteria for reusable software components. We introduce a taxonomy of factors that influence selection, describe each of them, and present a hierarchical decomposition method for deriving reuse goals from factors and formulating the goals into an evaluation criteria hierarchy. We present some highlights from two case studies in which the approach was applied. The approach presented in this paper is a part of the OTSO 1 method that has been developed for reusable component selection process.

Reference-contexts: Some general criteria have been proposed to help in the search for potential reusable components [24,25]. Boloix and Robillard recently presented a general framework for assessing the software product, process and their impact on the organization <ref> [6] </ref>. However, none of this work is specific to off-the-shelf (OTS 2 ) software selection, and the issue of how to define the evaluation criteria is not addressed. Furthermore, most of the reusable component literature does not seem to emphasize the sensitivity of such criteria to each situation.
