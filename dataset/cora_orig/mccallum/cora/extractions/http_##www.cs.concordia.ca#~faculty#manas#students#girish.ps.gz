Reference-contexts: The obvious 15 solution is to bring down the asking rate of video. For this purpose, it is essential to have good compression techniques. In the following paragraphs, we present a brief description of some commonly used compression techniques [AB95], <ref> [11193] </ref>. 1. DCT Transformation. A transformation useful in image compression is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This transformation converts an nfin block of elements into another block of nfin coefficients representing the two-dimensional unique spatial frequencies. The DCT function is reversible by using an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) function. <p> The sequence header contains control information needed to decode the MPEG-1 video sequence <ref> [11193] </ref>. It starts with a unique sequence header code. The horizontal and vertical sizes determine the size of the picture. <p> This challenge is answered by the MPEG-Group by using two interframe coding techniques: predictive and interpolative. The MPEG-1 video compression algorithm relies on two basic techniques: block based motion compensation for reduction of the temporal redundancy and transform based (DCT) compression for the reduction of the spatial redundancy [Gal91], <ref> [11193] </ref>. Motion compensation techniques are applied with predictors that are both casual (pure predictive coding) and non-casual (interpolative coding). The remaining signal (prediction error) is further compressed with spatial redundancy reduction (DCT).

Reference-contexts: In order to integrate video into the multimedia platform, the video signal needs to be scalable, platform independent, robust, and error resilient. In addition, it also needs to facilitate interactivity and editing. Analog video signal unfortunately fails to meet these requirements, thus, making it unsuitable for such multimedia platforms <ref> [AB95] </ref>. Hence, switching to digital not only answers these problems, but also opens up a whole new range of sophisticated digital video processing techniques, which can improve the quality of video. Video is a sequence of time varying images, which convey visual information. <p> Aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of horizontal to vertical resolution of the image. 2.1.2 Colour Spaces Video images in addition to the resolution are defined by the way colour information is stored <ref> [AB95] </ref>. A gray-scale picture has only one colour component: luminance. Since brightness is a complicated item to quantify, luminance was defined [Poy97]. For example, in an image with 8 bits/pixel scale, higher range values in this scale indicate lighter gray colour. <p> The following expressions specify the way the RGB colour space is converted to YUV space: Y = 0:3R + 0:59G + 0:11B V = 0:877 (R Y ) The human eye is known to be more sensitive to luminance components than to colour components <ref> [AB95] </ref>. This observation is used to separate both the luminance and chrominance parts so that the luminance component can be captured in a higher resolution than the chrominance component. <p> Table 1 shows the different categories and their examples. Entropy encoding is a term used to describe compression algorithms that increase the energy or the information density in a message <ref> [AB95] </ref>. The input to be compressed is considered to be a simple digital sequence and the semantics of the data is ignored. This technique is used for media regardless of their specific characteristics. Entropy encoding is also called lossless as the decompression process regenerates the data completely. <p> The different source encoding techniques make use of the characteristics of a specific medium. Such characteristics can include temporal and psychovisual redundancies mentioned in the last section. For example, a content prediction technique can make use of spatial redundancies as in the case of still images <ref> [AB95] </ref>. Hybrid compression techniques are a combination of entropy and source encoding techniques. These combine well known algorithms and transformation techniques that can be applied to multimedia systems [Ste93]. <p> The obvious 15 solution is to bring down the asking rate of video. For this purpose, it is essential to have good compression techniques. In the following paragraphs, we present a brief description of some commonly used compression techniques <ref> [AB95] </ref>, [11193]. 1. DCT Transformation. A transformation useful in image compression is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This transformation converts an nfin block of elements into another block of nfin coefficients representing the two-dimensional unique spatial frequencies. <p> The visual telephony group produced the recommendation H.261: "Video Codec for Audiovisual Services at pfi64 kbits". The focus of H.261 is the real-time encoding-decoding system, which exhibits less than 150 ms delay. H.261 has two modes of coding: intraframe and interframe <ref> [AB95] </ref>. The intraframe encoding is similar to JPEG, where each block of 8fi8 pixels is DCT transformed. The quantization of DC-coefficients differs from that of AC-coefficients. In the last step, the AC and DC parameters are entropically encoded to produce a variable length word. <p> In due course, attention turned towards higher rate applications, and the result was MPEG-2. This mainly targets broadcast video between 4 to 10 Mbps <ref> [AB95] </ref>. It is efficient for other applications with higher bit rates and sample rates like HDTV. Interlaced video streams which are common in broadcast television find MPEG-2 to be more suitable than MPEG-1. MPEG-2 handles different video streams which are divided into profiles and levels.

Reference-contexts: This restricts the users having higher bandwidth links from achieving a better quality. The authors <ref> [AM95] </ref> address this problem by proposing an architecture for video transmission, wherein a single transmission can be decomposed into multiple sessions with different bandwidth requirements using an application level gateway.

Reference-contexts: In this method, when a new session becomes active, instead of giving its share of bandwidth immediately, it is allocated gradually from 0 to final value. In this way the "older" sessions do not experience a sudden drop in service rates.

Reference-contexts: Practical experience recommends a total of 1.4 Mbps for audio and video for DVI and MPEG-1 [Stu95]. The proposed bandwidth provides good video quality and supports commercial audiovisual equipment. Additionally, it can be transmitted over the T1 leased lines of capacity 1.54 Mbps <ref> [Bat92] </ref>. Apart from this bandwidth capacity, the highly asymmetric nature of the traffic requires attention in dealing with bandwidth management. Transmission Delay. The delay restrictions of multimedia applications are more stringent than those of traditional data traffic.

Reference-contexts: In order to meet the above objectives, the Integrated Services (IS) model was proposed. This model supports both real-time and non-real-time applications. The underlying assumptions of IS model are <ref> [BCS94] </ref>: * resources must be explicitly managed in order to meet application requirements; * the service guarantees for a real-time service cannot be achieved without reser vations; * in spite of an application's ability to adapt, the end-to-end delay must be bounded; 41 * to secure statistical gain, it is desirable

Reference-contexts: Resource reservation is 47 one of the components in such architectures. In the following paragraphs, we briefly present the functionality of Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP), which is designed for an integrated services Internet <ref> [BZB + 96] </ref>. RSVP is used by a host, on behalf of an application data stream, to request specific QoS from the network of a particular data stream or flow. <p> RSVP requests will generally, although not necessarily, result in resources being reserved in each node along the data path. The attributes of RSVP can be summarized as follows <ref> [BZB + 96] </ref>: * RSVP makes resource reservations for both unicast and many-to-many multi-cast applications, adapting dynamically to changing group membership as well as to changing routes. * RSVP is simplex, i.e., it makes reservations for unidirectional data flows. * RSVP is receiver-oriented, i.e., the receiver of the data flow initiates <p> The packet classifier selects a service class for each packet in accordance with the reservation state setup by RSVP. While the packet scheduler implements QoS for each flow, it uses one of the service models defined by the Integrated Service Working Group <ref> [BZB + 96] </ref>. The flowspec in a reservation request will generally include a service class and two sets of numeric parameters; an Rspec (R for reserve) that defines the desired QoS and Tspec (T for traffic) that describes the data flow [BZB + 96]. Reservation Styles. <p> service models defined by the Integrated Service Working Group <ref> [BZB + 96] </ref>. The flowspec in a reservation request will generally include a service class and two sets of numeric parameters; an Rspec (R for reserve) that defines the desired QoS and Tspec (T for traffic) that describes the data flow [BZB + 96]. Reservation Styles. A reservation request includes a set of options that are collectively called the reservation style, shown in Figure 5. <p> In an explicit sender selection reservation, each filter spec must match exactly one sender, while in a wildcard sender selection no filter spec is needed. RSVP Message Types. There are two fundamental RSVP message types : Resv and Path <ref> [BZB + 96] </ref>. 49 Resv. Each Receiver host sends reservation request (Resv) message upstream towards the sender (s). These messages create and maintain reservation state in each node along the path (s).

Reference-contexts: We detail an effort in this direction led by the IETF's IP over the ATM working Group, in the following subsections. 3.5.1 TCP/IP Over ATM Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is widely used in the networking world <ref> [CCGP95] </ref>. TCP/IP places emphasis on inter-networking using a connectionless model. In TCP/IP, the IP layer is responsible for moving packets from one node to another, while TCP is responsible for verifying the correct delivery of data from client to server. <p> IP over ATM project issues are listed below <ref> [CCGP95] </ref>: 1. The encapsulation and transmission of IP network or link layer packets across an ATM Adaptation Layer 5 connection. 2. The provision of a mechanism for the resolution of IP addresses to their corresponding ATM addresses. <p> The multiplexing field allows a node that receives a network layer packet across an ATM connection to know what type of packet has been received and to know about the application by which it must be received. The methods identifying this type of information are <ref> [CCGP95] </ref>: 1. Virtual Channel multiplexing carries only one protocol across the ATM connec tion with the type of protocol identified at the connection setup time. 54 2. Logical Link Control/SubNet Access Protocol (LLC/SNAP) can carry many pro-tocols over the same VC connection. <p> In this case, the type of packet is identified by a header. 3.5.3 IP over ATM Address Resolution The "classical" view of IP is one in which clusters of IP nodes consisting of hosts and routers with similar subnet addresses are connected to nodes outside their cluster by IP routers <ref> [CCGP95] </ref>. The IETF adhered to this "classical" view by grouping IP nodes into Logical IP Subnets (LIS). The nodes in an LIS share the same IP subnet and communicate outside through an IP router.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it becomes necessary to maintain their relationship with respect to time. All these features become necessary to maintain the quality at the receiver's end. In the following paragraphs, we present details about the requirements of multimedia on network technologies [Kar95], <ref> [Dav92] </ref>. Bandwidth. Among the different media, transmission of compressed video requires one of the highest data rates, and accordingly, network experts predicted that the requested rate of such media would drive the bandwidth requirements in the 1990s [Stu95]. <p> Quality of Service. Real-time applications based on their reaction to delay are categorized into two classes. First, applications that are intolerant to delay will have good performance only if they get a perfect upper-bound on the delay <ref> [Dav92] </ref>. Second, applications that do not require a perfect upper-bound on delay can adjust to variations in delay and are called adaptive applications. Based on these applications, two real-time service classes are defined: guaranteed service and controlled load service.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the development of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) was initiated. In 1988, CCITT (now ITU) designated ATM, a cell based switching technology, as the transmission mode for the future broadband ISDN services <ref> [For95] </ref>, [Sat96], [SJ95], [Vet95], [Ste95]. At the same time the ATM Forum, driven by more than 700 members, including almost all major providers of data and communication equipment, focused on the definition of the private ATM networks for the local and wide area environments. <p> There is no flow-control. Thus, the cells are subject to drops once the buffers are full. 2. The ATM Layer. The ATM layer provides an interface between the AAL and the physical layer. The ATM layer is responsible for [SN95], <ref> [For95] </ref>: * relaying cells from the AAL to the physical layer for transmission and from the physical layer to the AAL for use at the end system; * translation of the cell identifier and management functions; 34 * multiplexing and demultiplexing of cells of different connections into a single cell stream; <p> The Usage Parameter Control function may implement the GCRA, or one or more equivalent algorithms, to enforce conformance. Although traffic conformance is defined in terms of GCRA, the network is not required to use this algorithm for UPC. The continuous state leaky bucket <ref> [For95] </ref>, a version of GCRA, is defined by the flow chart in Figure 4. 3.3 Internet The Internet is a loose collection of networks organized into multi-level hierarchies using a wide variety of interconnection technologies. It is often referred to as a network of networks.

Reference-contexts: the temporal redundancy which could bring down the storage and bandwidth requirements considerably, extending the ISO committee to moving pictures was a natural step. 2.3.2 CCITT Expert Group on Visual Telephony The high growth oriented nature of the video compression area was triggered by applications such as teleconferencing and video-telephony <ref> [Gal91] </ref>. The definition and planned deployment of ISDN was the motivation for the development of compression techniques at the rate of pfi64 kbps, where p takes values from 1 to 30. The visual telephony group produced the recommendation H.261: "Video Codec for Audiovisual Services at pfi64 kbits". <p> Thus, the decks were cleared for the development of MPEG-1. 2.3.3 CMTT/2 Activities The use of digital video compression for video-conferencing and video-telephony also opens up the issue of its use in broadcasting compressed television signals <ref> [Gal91] </ref>. The transmission channels for such an application are either the high level digital hierarchy-H21 (34 Mbps) and H22 (45 Mbps) or digital satellite channels. The CMTT/2 2 addressed the compression of television signals at 34 and 45 Mbps. The focus of this work was to produce quality codecs. <p> The MPEG-1, part of the ISO-IEC/JCT1/SC2/WK11, was entrusted with the development of an audio-visual standard <ref> [Gal91] </ref>, [Chi95], [Fur94]. The premise of 2 CMTT is a joint commission of the CCITT and the CCIR the International Consultative Committee on Broadcasting. 20 MPEG-1 is that the video signal and associated audio can be compressed to a bit rate of 1.5 Mbps. <p> The layers and their functions are summarized in Table 2 <ref> [Gal91] </ref>. 2.4.2 MPEG-1 Compression Algorithm The main aspect which stands out between a still image compression technique like JPEG and a moving picture compression technique like MPEG, is interframe coding. This aspect stems out, since the quality requirements demand a very high compression not achievable with intraframe coding alone. <p> This challenge is answered by the MPEG-Group by using two interframe coding techniques: predictive and interpolative. The MPEG-1 video compression algorithm relies on two basic techniques: block based motion compensation for reduction of the temporal redundancy and transform based (DCT) compression for the reduction of the spatial redundancy <ref> [Gal91] </ref>, [11193]. Motion compensation techniques are applied with predictors that are both casual (pure predictive coding) and non-casual (interpolative coding). The remaining signal (prediction error) is further compressed with spatial redundancy reduction (DCT).

Reference-contexts: These characteristics help to support Internet Integrated Services over ATM. For this purpose, we need to look at mapping service classes and supporting RSVP over ATM. The three service classes of IP service model can be mapped to five classes of ATM service model <ref> [GB97] </ref>, as given in Table 3. The most appropriate ATM service class for the corresponding IP service class is shown in italics. RT-VBR is best suited for guaranteed service as it can utilize the unused portion of other applications and can support more bursty sources.

Reference-contexts: In order to show the difference in magnitude (but not actual values), consider the example of traditional traffic, which consists of a file transfer and video. The file transfer can have a maximum end-to-end delay of 1 sec, while video can have 0.25 sec <ref> [HSS90] </ref>. Consider another example, voice communication via satellite with round-trip transmission time of around 0.6 second makes it very difficult for partners to hold a normal conversation. In this case, an end-to-end delay of 0.3 second is desired.

Reference-contexts: The system performance will be very bad if checksumming is not performed either in hardware or at the media access layer or link layer, as it consumes more time thereby reducing the performance <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. Error correction through retransmission due to a negative acknowledgement is not appropriate for time critical data as the retransmitted data would normally arrive late. A possible remedy for the conflicting goals of reliability and low delay is to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques. <p> As a result, FEC schemes are suitable for real-time traffic, 30 especially for links with long propagation delays. There are disadvantages with FEC <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. First, the load from a source may increase due to error correction. As packet losses increase with load, FEC may tend to cause more losses, degrading overall performance. Second, FEC is not effective when the packet losses are bursty, a case similar to that of high-speed networks. <p> These applications are called best effort service applications. But, presently there are applications which need a bound on the end-to-end delay. For example, an audio application carrying voice as a 64 kbps requires the round trip delay to be around 150 ms <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. Applications like this, which need a guarantee from the network on the performance, are called guaranteed service applications. For guaranteed delay bound applications, any packets that arrive at the sink beyond the prescribed delay will be discarded thereby degrading the performance. <p> Scheduling disciplines are required as the networks are expected to carry diverse traffic consisting of best effort and guaranteed service applications. Apart from the best effort traffic, future networks are slated to carry applications requiring bounds on their performance. A scheduling discipline needs to satisfy four requirements <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. First, it should be simple to implement for both guaranteed service and best effort service. Second, it needs to maintain fairness and protection for best effort connections. Third, it needs to manage performance bounds for guaranteed service connections. Finally, it should possess a simple and efficient admission control. <p> In the next two subsections, we briefly present some scheduling mechanisms for the best effort and guaranteed service connections. 3.4.1 Scheduling Best Effort Connections Best effort applications expect the scheduling principle to provide max-min fair allocation of resources. This can be formally stated as follows <ref> [Kes97] </ref>: * Allocation of resources proceeds in the order of increasing demand. * No source gets a resource share larger than its demand. * Sources with unsatisfied demands get an equal share of the resource. In the following paragraphs we present some scheduling disciplines. <p> In the following paragraphs we present some scheduling disciplines. Additional schemes and further information can be found in <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. Generalized Processor Sharing Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) assumes that packets are in separate logical queues [Kes97]. During a finite interval it visits 51 each non-empty queue and serves an infinitesimally small amount of data from each queue. <p> In the following paragraphs we present some scheduling disciplines.

Generalized Processor Sharing Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) assumes that packets are in separate logical queues [Kes97]. During a finite interval it visits 51 each non-empty queue and serves an infinitesimally small amount of data from each queue.

The next two paragraphs contain two notable mechanisms <ref> [Kes97] </ref>. Virtual Clocks. A virtual clock scheduler is an independent scheme. The packets are stamped with a tag, which determines the serving order. The tag allocates the virtual transmission time [SN95].

Reference-contexts: Our design space consists of: (i) whether the buffers should be shared or partitioned and (ii) whether the bandwidth should be shared and managed using a FIFO scheduler, or partitioned (perhaps dynamically) and controlled using a scheduler employing some Generalized Processor Scheduling mechanism <ref> [PG93] </ref>. Our results suggest that in order to ensure fairness among different streams, it is necessary to partition both buffers and bandwidth. A second outcome of our tests is that the specific manner in which buffers are partitioned is not so important, as long as some minimum buffering is available.

Reference-contexts: A gray-scale picture has only one colour component: luminance. Since brightness is a complicated item to quantify, luminance was defined <ref> [Poy97] </ref>. For example, in an image with 8 bits/pixel scale, higher range values in this scale indicate lighter gray colour. Thus, a value 0 represents the colour black and 255 represents the colour white. In order to capture the chrominance part of colour video images, three components are required.

Reference-contexts: Other details are being discussed. 3.3.2 Real-Time Transport Protocol In an inter-network, for playback of audio and video, TCP may be appropriate. However, for real-time delivery of audio and video, TCP and other reliable transport protocols are inappropriate due to the following reasons <ref> [Sch95] </ref>: * TCP cannot support multicast. * Even for unicast, reliable transmission is inappropriate for delay-sensitive data such as real-time audio and video. By the time the sender knows that the receiver has missed a packet and retransmitted it, a period of one round-trip time would have elapsed. <p> Audio and video have natural rates that cannot be suddenly decreased without starving the receiver. Thus, there is a need for real-time protocols. In the following paragraphs we describe the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and its constituents. RTP has been designed within the IETF <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. RTP provides end-to-end delivery services for data with real-time characteristics such as interactive audio and video. 44 The services provided include play-load type identification, sequence numbering, time stamping and delivery monitoring. <p> RTP is a protocol framework, which can be integrated into applications rather than implemented as a separate layer.

We enumerate the set of traffic contract parameters along with their definitions below <ref> [SJ95] </ref>: 1. Peak Cell Rate is defined as the static amount of bandwidth that is continuously available or the maximum instantaneous rate at which the user will transmit. 2. Sustained Cell Rate is defined as the average rate as measured over a long time interval. 36 3. <p> Burst Tolerance (BT) is defined as the maximum burst size (MBS) that can be sent at the PCR. This is the bucket size parameter for the leaky bucket algorithm employed to control the traffic entering the network. BT and MBS are related as follows <ref> [SJ95] </ref>: BT = (M BS 1) 1 P CR 7. Minimum Cell Rate is defined as the minimum cell rate desired by the user. 3.2.4 Traffic Management The ATM traffic management specification defines a set of traffic and congestion control functions to monitor the network.

Reference-contexts: The second major difference is that of ATM's QoS 56 facility and IP's best effort service. This is being solved by extending the Internet as explained in the Integrated Internet section. Networks offering QoS need packet scheduling schemes, which can help sustain the promised QoS. The work by <ref> [SL97] </ref> proposes such a scheme wherein the authors enhance the GPS scheme by addressing its shortcomings. In GPS, service rate received by a session is proportional to the backlogged sessions in the system. If another session becomes active, the service rate of a session may change abruptly.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these, images in video sequences are characterized by colour spaces or chrominance and luminance. In the following subsections, we provide an overview of these aspects. 2.1.1 Resolution Resolution specifies the matrix of pixels that constitutes the image size, also referred to as spatial resolution <ref> [SN95] </ref>. The process of sampling in fact establishes the resolution of an image. Sampling in the horizontal direction defines the horizontal resolution of the picture. In contrast, sampling in the vertical direction yields the vertical resolution, indicated by the number of lines. <p> This observation is used to separate both the luminance and chrominance parts so that the luminance component can be captured in a higher resolution than the chrominance component. Additional details on this issue can be found in <ref> [SN95] </ref>. 2.2 Video Compression Multimedia systems include media such as images, audio, video and graphics in addition to the traditional data types. Among the new media in picture, images have considerably higher storage requirements than text while audio and video need still higher data storage. <p> Among the new media in picture, images have considerably higher storage requirements than text while audio and video need still higher data storage. The data rates required for transfer of continuous media are also significant as illustrated by the following examples <ref> [SN95] </ref>: * For text, employing 2 bytes/character of 8 fi 8 pixels for a screen of size 640 fi 480 results in: Characters per screen = 640fi480 8fi8 = 4800 Storage required per screen = 4800 fi 2bytes = 9600bytes Storage required per screen ' 9:4kbytes * An uncompressed audio signal <p> In this case, an end-to-end delay of 0.3 second is desired. Practical experience suggests an end-to-end delay of 150 ms for interactive video applications [Stu95]. Based on the delay characteristic, traffic can fall into one of the three categories 29 <ref> [SN95] </ref>. First, the asynchronous transmission mode directs communication with no restrictions on time. Second, the synchronous transmission mode defines a bounded transmission delay for each message. Third, the isochronous transmission mode defines a constant transmission delay for each message. Audio and video fall into the isochronous category. <p> Reliability. Existing communications systems strive to provide end-to-end reliability by using checksum and sequence numbering for error control and some form of negative or missing positive acknowledgement with packet retransmission handshake for error recovery <ref> [SN95] </ref>. The system performance will be very bad if checksumming is not performed either in hardware or at the media access layer or link layer, as it consumes more time thereby reducing the performance [Kes97]. <p> The need for integration arises because of the inherent dependencies among the information coded in media objects. Though the word synchronization refers to time, in multimedia it is often used to reflect content, spatial, and temporal relationships between media objects <ref> [SN95] </ref>. For instance, when audio, video, and other data streams come from different sources via different routers, there is a need for mechanisms to synchronize these different streams at the destination in order to achieve the equivalent of lip synchronization. <p> There is no flow-control. Thus, the cells are subject to drops once the buffers are full. 2. The ATM Layer. The ATM layer provides an interface between the AAL and the physical layer. The ATM layer is responsible for <ref> [SN95] </ref>, [For95]: * relaying cells from the AAL to the physical layer for transmission and from the physical layer to the AAL for use at the end system; * translation of the cell identifier and management functions; 34 * multiplexing and demultiplexing of cells of different connections into a single cell <p> The next two paragraphs contain two notable mechanisms [Kes97]. Virtual Clocks. A virtual clock scheduler is an independent scheme. The packets are stamped with a tag, which determines the serving order. The tag allocates the virtual transmission time <ref> [SN95] </ref>. One distinguishing feature is that the tag values do not emulate the GPS discipline as in the case of WFQ. The virtual clock scheduler emulates time division multiplexing in a similar way that a fair queueing scheduler 52 emulates GPS. <p> Otherwise, the artifacts become noticeable, and thus would lead to degraded performance. For example, an MPEG sequence operating at 30 fps needs a frame to be played every 33 ms. Though the eye can tolerate a delay of 40 ms, any delay beyond that would impair the quality <ref> [SN95] </ref>. In order to meet such requirements, we need mechanisms to guarantee required performance levels before embarking with the actual transmission. ATM is one such technology, which offers the QoS mechanism. Much of the future success of ATM is attributed to ATM's ability to interoperate with IP.

Reference-contexts: Policing can be done in two ways. The first, simple policing, refers to comparing the arriving traffic against a Tspec. The second, reshaping, refers to the reconstruction of a traffic's shape to conform to the Tspec <ref> [SPG97] </ref>. 42 The controlled load service is an enhanced quality of service to support applications requiring better performance than the best effort service. Service for this class is described by using only Tspec. As the network does not provide any quantitative guarantee, Rspec is not required.

Reference-contexts: For example, a content prediction technique can make use of spatial redundancies as in the case of still images [AB95]. Hybrid compression techniques are a combination of entropy and source encoding techniques. These combine well known algorithms and transformation techniques that can be applied to multimedia systems <ref> [Ste93] </ref>. For example, each hybrid technique in Table 1 uses entropy encoding in the form of run length encoding and/or a statistical compression. Video sequences need to be compressed aggressively to reduce the data storage and bandwidth requirements. <p> subsections we present three MPEG related standards. 1 CCITT is the International Committee on Telegraph and Telephones. 18 2.3.1 The Joint Pictures Expert Group Joint Pictures Expert Group (JPEG) played a considerable role in the beginning of the MPEG as both were in the same working group of the ISO <ref> [Ste93] </ref>. In JPEG, the picture is divided into blocks of 8fi8 pixels for encoding. Each block is transformed into another block of 8fi8 using the DCT function to obtain 64 unique two-dimensional spatial frequency coefficients. Next, the coefficients are quantized using an 8fi8 quantization table.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth. Among the different media, transmission of compressed video requires one of the highest data rates, and accordingly, network experts predicted that the requested rate of such media would drive the bandwidth requirements in the 1990s <ref> [Stu95] </ref>. In order to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements, video is compressed in today's applications. We look at three video standards: MPEG, DVI and H.261. <p> These standards require about 1.5 Mbps for MPEG-1, 4 Mbps and above for MPEG-2, 1.2 to 1.8 Mbps for DVI and 0.064 to 2 Mbps for H.261. Practical experience recommends a total of 1.4 Mbps for audio and video for DVI and MPEG-1 <ref> [Stu95] </ref>. The proposed bandwidth provides good video quality and supports commercial audiovisual equipment. Additionally, it can be transmitted over the T1 leased lines of capacity 1.54 Mbps [Bat92]. Apart from this bandwidth capacity, the highly asymmetric nature of the traffic requires attention in dealing with bandwidth management. Transmission Delay. <p> In this case, an end-to-end delay of 0.3 second is desired. Practical experience suggests an end-to-end delay of 150 ms for interactive video applications <ref> [Stu95] </ref>. Based on the delay characteristic, traffic can fall into one of the three categories 29 [SN95]. First, the asynchronous transmission mode directs communication with no restrictions on time. Second, the synchronous transmission mode defines a bounded transmission delay for each message. <p> Isochrony does not have to be maintained across the entire path from source to sink, only at the information's final destination. Thus, isochrony can be recovered by a play-out buffer at the sink. The cost to be paid for this is the additional delay due to the play-out buffer <ref> [Stu95] </ref>. For practical purposes, synchronous traffic with sufficiently low delay bound can fake an isochronous stream between source and sink. Therefore, the delay variance or jitter is not considered as a separate item. To meet CCITT requirements, the maximum delay bound is assumed to be 150 ms. <p> Synchronization can be achieved using a combination of time-stamping and play-out buffers <ref> [Stu95] </ref>. 3.2 The Asynchronous Transfer Mode In an effort to provide real-time transport capability for emerging multimedia applications, networks with high bandwidth and low latency are required. For an application aiming to transmit large amounts of data in real-time, new network architectures and protocols need to be designed.

While each of the AALs is optimized for a particular type of traffic, there is no stipulation in the standard that AALs designated for one service cannot be used for another.

Reference-contexts: In order to recover from packet losses, error correction techniques like FEC are used.

First, many applications are very responsive to the quality of service offered by the underlying networks to their data. A network, to offer adequate QoS, has to go farther than the best effort service model and permit traffic streams to reserve resources.
