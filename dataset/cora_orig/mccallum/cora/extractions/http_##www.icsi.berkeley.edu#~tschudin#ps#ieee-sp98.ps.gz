Abstract: Mobile code technology has become a driving force for recent advances in distributed systems. The concept of mobility of executable code raises major security problems. In this paper we deal with the protection of mobile code from possibly malicious hosts. We conceptualize on the specific cryptographic problems posed by mobile code. We are able to provide a solution for some of these problems: We present techniques how to achieve non-interactive evaluation with encrypted functions in certain cases and give a complete solution for this problem in important instances. We further present a way how an agent might securely perform a cryptographic primitive, digital signing, in an untrusted execution environment. Our results are based on the use of homomorphic encryption schemes and function composition techniques.

Reference-contexts: We then present a protocol that realizes mobile code privacy for programs that compute polynomials over rings and give an exact analysis of its information leakage. The protocol relies on the use of a public key encryption scheme that has certain additional properties. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Lipton and Sander described such a scheme for rings of type Z=N Z, N smooth, for previous work see [2]. Thus for this case we can present a first complete solution for the non-interactive evaluation of encrypted functions. <p> To obtain E (xy) add up those E (2 i x) for which y i 6= 0. Now apply proposition 2. Observe that the algorithm MIXED-MULT makes at most O (log N ) 2 calls to PLUS. Benaloh in [2] and Lipton and Sander in <ref> [1] </ref> describe an additive homomorphic scheme on rings Z=N Zfor smooth integers N (a positive integer is called smooth if it has only small prime factors). <p> Assume further that the used encryption scheme is polynomial time indistinguishable. Then no information is leaked about f except it's skeleton. The additive scheme of Lipton and Sander <ref> [1] </ref> is polynomial time indistinguishable under the (reasonable) assumption of the hardness of the Power Residue Hypothesis (which is a generalization of the well-known Quadratic Residue Hypothesis to residues of higher degree).

Reference-contexts: The computations themselves have become mobile. Various mobile agent systems have been built and are subject to ongoing research, each targeting at another application field (see e.g., <ref> [3, 4] </ref>). In the following we describe three of them. Mobile Computing: Computing with mobile devices poses problems to networking because the changing physical location requires a continuous reconfiguration of the data links. If connectivity can not always be maintained it also requires applications to handle extended off-line periods.

Reference-contexts: Information retrieval is also the basic scenario for military applications where mobile agents would roam the slow battle field network for finding suspicious incidents that endanger a large scale operation <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although it induces some processing overhead, this instructional mode of communications gives the most freedom for realizing customized communication architectures <ref> [6] </ref>. Several experimental systems are under construction (MIT, University of Pennsylvania, etc), many of them under a special DARPA research program [7]. A primary goal of active networks is to shift information processing tasks from the end nodes to internal nodes. Information fusion inside the network reduces latency and bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: In another case, a mobile shopping agent is sent to the servers of various airlines for checking the availability and finding out the best price for a given itinerary and date (in <ref> [8] </ref> we discuss in more detail an E-commerce application of mobile agents). Both scenarios heavily rely on the flexibility provided by mobile code technology: They take place in an open and competitive market environment where new products, new providers and new customers can join the system at any time.

Reference-contexts: One reason for this disequilibrium may be the folklore saying that mobile code is impossible to protect without resort to special hardware, simply because the code has to be executed by the hosting system (see e.g., Chess et al. in <ref> [9] </ref>). Intuitively this makes sense because the following points certainly apply: * Cleartext data can be read and changed. * Cleartext programs can be manipulated. * Cleartext messages, e.g., to the originator, can be faked. This list also points to the problems of using mobile code in security sensitive applications.

Reference-contexts: By varying a definition of general cryptography given in <ref> [11] </ref>, we may define mobile cryptography as the study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security of mobile executable code in a network. The distinctive aspect of mobile cryptography is that the border conditions for realizing cryptographic protocols are different.

Reference-contexts: If one succeeds with non-interactive evaluation of encrypted functions (EEF) for Boolean circuits the problem of EEF for general programs would at least theoretically be solved. Note for this that every Turing machine program can be efficiently simulated by Boolean circuits <ref> [14] </ref> 4.1 Non-Interactive Evaluation of En crypted Functions The ability to hide a function f inside an executable program is of central importance for mobile agent protection because the obtained code privacy immediately yields code integrity as explained earlier.

Reference-contexts: We start by discussing related work on the problem of processing encrypted data (PED). Abadi and Feigenbaum <ref> [15] </ref> described a protocol how to securely evaluate a Boolean circuit in encrypted data. They further reduced EEF (for Boolean circuits) to PED by representing the Boolean circuit that is to be hidden as data fed to a universal Boolean circuit.

Reference-contexts: Also motivated by the problem of processing encrypted data, Rivest et al. [10] asked in 1978 for encryption schemes having certain additional homomorphic properties. In 1991 Feigenbaum and Merritt asked more specifically <ref> [16] </ref>: Is there a public-key encryption function E such that both E (x+y) and E (xy) are easy to compute from E (x) and E (y)? It is easy to see that an encryption function having these properties allows to evaluate polynomial expressions in the encrypted data without revealing the input

Reference-contexts: Encryption schemes that have this strong property are called polynomial time indistinguishable (see <ref> [17] </ref> for further details). With this background we can summarize the results as follows: Theorem 4 Let E be an additively homomorphic encryption scheme on Z=N Z.

It is easy to transform the above problem with one function f into this setting. <p> This problem is known to be very hard. So an adversary will not be able to invert f except for some very simple choices of f .) Ways to construct birational functions s that are easy to invert have been described by Shamir in the second part of <ref> [19] </ref>. However, the schemes resulting from those constructions have been successfully attacked by Coppersmith, Stern and Vaudenay [20]. So there is a need to find new constructions for secure birational functions to put our ideas to work.

So there is a need to find new constructions for secure birational functions to put our ideas to work. We expect that other ways to construct secure bi-rational maps can be found e.g., based on concepts from Algebraic Geometry where birational maps are extensively studied.
