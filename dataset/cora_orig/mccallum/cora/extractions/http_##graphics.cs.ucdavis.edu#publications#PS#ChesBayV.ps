Abstract: We discuss a visualization system for the comparison of simulated and measured water quality. The system extends SCIRT (Site Characterization Interactive Research Toolkit), an interactive system originally developed at the NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi State University.

Reference-contexts: The model [2] simulates 22 environmental parameters, e.g., salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Computations are made on a 3D grid containing approximately 4,000 grid cells. Typical simulations encompass one year and produce approximately 17,000,000 computations of each variable. 2 Visualization Software We have extended SCIRT <ref> [1] </ref> for model-data comparisons. SCIRT assumed that data sets were given on structured, rectilinear grids, but it has been extended to support curvilinear coordinates. Visualization techniques include Cutting Planes, Minicubes, and Point Clouds [4].

Reference-contexts: We do not re-sample model output and observations onto one grid; the necessary interpolation might lead to false impressions when comparing model results and observations. An ongoing study of the Chesapeake Bay presents an ideal study for research in 3D visualization of model-data comparisons.

Reference-contexts: Only probes lying in the user-specified time interval [t *; t + *] are considered. After the probe files are read, one determines the grid cells containing probe data based on the cell's Jacobian <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since it is important to know how many probe data are used to compute the average over a cell, this number is indicated. We use icons <ref> [5] </ref> to do so since the color is dedicated to the function value. For cells containing less than six points, we use flat-shaded hexahedra, scaled with respect to the number of points. For cells containing between six and ten points, we use scaled octahedra.
