Title: An Isotopic Invariant for Planar Drawings of Connected Planar Graphs  
Author: J. Hidders 
Abstract: In this report we present a data structure called PLA-structure for representing the topological information of a database containing points, lines and areas in a plane. This data structure gives for every point in the database the circular alternating list of incident lines and adjacent areas that one sees as one proceeds clockwise around the point. It will be shown in this report that if we add an indication of which area is the "outside" of the drawing in the plane, the datas-tructure is a complete isotopic invariant. This means that the data structure contains exactly all the isotopic information of the data. The data structure is therefore interesting as an efficient data structure for spatial data that is mainly queried on its topological aspects.

Reference-contexts: This last definition is rather informal but it is shown in <ref> [KPV95] </ref> that it is a well-defined notion. This is based upon the following observation. <p> It has been shown in <ref> [KPV95] </ref> that there is an efficient algorithm for deciding whether an arbitrary PLA-structure actually represents a possible spatial database. 3 The Invariance of PLA-Structures In this section we will prove that PLA-structures contain exactly all the topological information of a spatial database.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The last few years has shown the rise of a new area in database research viz. spatial databases <ref> [Par95] </ref>. Spatial databases offer next to the conventional database services also the possibilities of storing spatial data and manipulating it with geometric and topological operations.
