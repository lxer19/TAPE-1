Abstract: A Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) fitting (Fried-man, 1991) approach is used to model univariate and multivarite survival data with possible censoring. The possible models contain proportional hazards models as a subclass, which makes it possible to diagnose departures from proportionality. A reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (Green, 1995) algorithm is described to obtain the estimate of the hazard function as well as the survival curve.

Reference-contexts: These are known as frailty models and assign a random effect for each group from which the data arises. This random effect term is assumed to be due to some variability due to unobserved covariates. These models are a generalisation of the normal proportional hazards model <ref> (Clayton and Cuzick, 1985) </ref> and the likelihood is the same as (2) with just the addition of a random effect term. Similarly, we will think of these models as an extension of the Bayesian model we will introduce.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is concerned with the Bayesian analysis of survival data in the presence of covariate information. The most popular model in this context is the Cox proportional hazards model <ref> (Cox, 1972) </ref>. A basic assumption of Cox model is that the conditional hazard function is a multiplicative function of time and the vector of covariates; this may not be valid for many datasets.

Reference-contexts: For example Kalbfleisch (1978) models log F (t) as a draw from Gamma process while Hjort (1990) models fl (t) as a draw from a Beta process. Note that the earliest work, which modeled 1 F (t) by a Dirichlet process <ref> (Ferguson, 1973) </ref>, implies that log F (t) is a Levy process. More recently, Gelfand and Mallick (1995) extended these models by introducing a random finite mixture process prior and modifying the usual proportional hazard form as (tjX) = 0 (t)g (fiX) (3) where g is an unknown link function.

Reference-contexts: Using a MCMC approach we can easily create the predictive interval for the survival curve as well. The form of the basis functions is important and is the same as those used by the MARS <ref> (Friedman, 1991) </ref> procedure.

Reference-contexts: Recently Denison, Mallick and Smith (1997) introduced a Bayesian MARS (BMARS) model which used polynomial basis functions and their product interactions to model different type of surfaces. The basis functions and the knots were adaptively chosen using a reversible jump MCMC <ref> (Green,1995) </ref> algorithm which was shown to be both highly flexible and easily interpretable and, in many situations, it appeared to work better than the classical MARS model proposed by Friedman (1991). In this paper we will demonstrate the use of Bayesian MARS models for the analysis of survival data.
