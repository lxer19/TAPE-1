Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?  
Author: Kenneth D. Forbus Dedre Gentner 
Affiliation: Qualitative Reasoning Group Psychology Department Beckman Institute, University of Illinois  
Abstract: Judgments of similarity and soundness are important aspects of human analogical processing. This paper explores how these judgments can be modeled using SME, a simulation of Gentner's structure-mapping theory. We focus on structural evaluation, explicating several principles which psychologically plausible algorithms should follow. We introduce the Specificity Conjecture, which claims that naturalistic representations include a preponderance of appearance and low-order information. We demonstrate via computational experiments that this conjecture affects how structural evaluation should be performed, including the choice of normalization technique and how the systematicity preference is implemented.

Reference-contexts: To achieve accountability, SME's input includes two sets of rules which construct and evaluate local matches. By varying these rules SME can be programmed to emulate all the comparisons of structure-mapping, as well other matchers consistent with its assumptions <ref> [4] </ref>. Here we use this Forbus & Gentner programmability to perform sensitivity analyses to rule out certain processing choices as being unable to account for human data. Given base and target descriptions to match, SME produces a set of Gmaps, representing the possible interpretations of the comparison. <p> However, it is reasonably large, indicating that the algorithm is not overly sensitive to particular choices of parameters. For example, within the ranges Same-Predicate 2 [10 3 ; 0:01], Same-Function 2 [10 4 ; 0:01], and Trickle-Down 2 <ref> [4; 16] </ref>, every point fits perfectly. The regions which are clearly outside are interesting: Trickle-Down values of 1:0 or less, values of Same-Predicate of 0:3 or more, and values of Same-Function 0:9 or higher.

Reference-contexts: The construction rules guide this process 1 . At this stage the match is incoherent, in that the set of match hypotheses collectively can contain many-to-one mappings. Local constraints, such as one-to-one mappings and structural consistency (see <ref> [6] </ref> for details) are enforced next. These constraints rule out match hypotheses which cannot be part of any legal interpretation, and note which pairs of match hypotheses cannot consistently be part of the same interpretation. <p> This paper focuses on the algorithm level, importing only the most general constraints from the prospect of highly parallel, neural-like implementations. Our current implementation is serial, but that is an accident of technology the SME algorithm lends itself naturally to a variety of parallel implementations <ref> [6] </ref> 3 . The score associated with a match hypothesis indicates how strongly the correspondence between the base and target items it connects is preferred on structural grounds. We restrict evaluation rules to use only local, structural properties in assigning scores. <p> This computation, too, can proceed in parallel, taking O (log (N )) for a match hypothesis set of size N <ref> [6] </ref>. The structural evaluation system thus has three parameters: Same-Predicate, Same-Function, and Trickle-Down 6 . Once the propagation of local scores for all match hypotheses is complete, the SES of an interpretation (Gmap) is computed by summing of the scores of its constituent match hypotheses. <p> The 5 Functions are treated differently from predicates, since derived matches between non-identical functions are allowed if the structure above them matches (e.g., Temperature to Pressure). 6 The original structural evaluation rules <ref> [6] </ref> had eight parameters; the reduction to three required some theoretical analysis and about two Symbolics-days of numerical sensitivity analyses.

Reference-contexts: We have suggested that human structural evalution of analogies depends largely on the degree to which the analogs share systematic relational structure (i.e., share systems of relations governed by common higher-order relations) <ref> [8] </ref>. There is psychological evidence supporting this position as a descriptive account [10]. SME [5,6], our simulation of Gentner's structure-mapping theory [7,8], includes a structural evaluator which appears to match psychological data on analogical soundness judgments reasonably well [17]. <p> However, understanding those factors involves simulating larger pieces of the overall processing system, with a subsequent increase in the number of free parameters. By understanding structural evaluation in isolation we hope to tightly constraint that aspect of the system. Structure-mapping postulates that systematicity is preferred in structural evaluations <ref> [8] </ref>; i.e., a Gmap involving a larger connected system of relations, particularly higher-order relations 2 , should have a higher SES than one involving a smaller, or disconnected, system of relations.

Reference-contexts: SME provides a process model for structure-mapping. The goal is to achieve sophisticated results using computationally simple techniques. We believe that combining local match hypotheses into coherent global interpretations is a psychologically plausible aspect of SME <ref> [9] </ref>. However, not every aspect of SME is equally plausible psychologically. For example, we do not believe people necessarily compute all interpretations, although for experimental purposes we generally have SME compute the complete set of Gmaps to gain more insight into the match.

Reference-contexts: Thus GREATER-THAN (x,y) is first-order if x and y are objects, and CAUSE [GREATER-THAN (x,y), BREAK (x)] is second-order. Examples of higher-order relations include CAUSE and IMPLIES. 3 We view Holyoak and Thagard's ACME <ref> [11] </ref> as evidence that SME could be implemented in at least a localist connectionist framework, since there is substantial overlap in the information processing and algorithm levels between SME and ACME. 4 We assume a decompositional semantics, so that synonyms are translated into some common form (c.f. [1,3]).

Reference-contexts: This part of the structural evaluation can proceed in parallel with match hypothesis construction. At first glance systematicity might appear to be an inherently global concept, requiring difficult computations to enforce. We implemented it locally via trickle-down, a cascade-like model <ref> [12] </ref>. In trickle-down, a match hypothesis M H adds its score, scaled by the parameter Trickle-Down, to the match hypotheses linking the arguments of the items matched by M H . <p> This is not difficult, if one allows information to propagate "upwards" from match hypotheses between entities (which have order zero) to match hypotheses which include them as arguments, and so on. However, this explicit computation of order seems inelegant, since, to paraphrase <ref> [12] </ref>, it requires "more complex currency" than simply propagating local scores. A second difference is that order-scoring directly signals the existence of higher-order relations, and only indirectly signals the connectivity of a system of relational matches. Trickle-down, on the other hand, directly signals connectivity, leaving order implicit.

Reference-contexts: We can divide such strategies into two broad classes: result normalization, and contribution normalization. Connectionist models tend to use result normalization; a unit's inputs are multiplied by a set of coefficients, added, and then scaled by some non-linear function <ref> [13] </ref>. Formalisms for probabilistic reasoning tend to use contribution normalization; MYCIN's certainty factors, for instance, scale every contribution to belief in a proposition by the percentage of uncertainty remaining for that belief.

Reference-contexts: The systematicity constraint is stated at the information processing level (as defined by Marr <ref> [14] </ref>); additional principles are needed to provide constraint at the algorithm and implementation levels. This paper focuses on the algorithm level, importing only the most general constraints from the prospect of highly parallel, neural-like implementations.

Reference-contexts: There is psychological evidence supporting this position as a descriptive account [10]. SME [5,6], our simulation of Gentner's structure-mapping theory [7,8], includes a structural evaluator which appears to match psychological data on analogical soundness judgments reasonably well <ref> [17] </ref>. In this paper we use a combination of theoretical argument and sensitivity analyses to probe more deeply into the issues surrounding structural evaluation. Section 2 begins with a brief overview of SME and outlines some constraints on psychologically plausible algorithms for structural evaluation. <p> Consequently, our conclusions will be based completely on ordinal comparisons between scores, never on the actual magnitude of scores themselves. 3 Modeling Soundness Judgments To perform a sensitivity analysis one must have a standard for comparison. We use the cognitive simulation experiment described in <ref> [17] </ref>, which showed that SME could replicate aspects of human soundness judgments demonstrated empirically [10,15]. In the psychological studies, subjects first read a large set of stories. In a subsequent session, they were shown similar stories and tried to retrieve corresponding original stories (an access measure).
