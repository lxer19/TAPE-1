Abstract: This paper presents an efficient strategy for testability analysis and fault diagnosis of analog circuits using behavioral models. A key contribution is a new algorithm for determining analog testability. Experimentally, we determined the testability and faults of a fabricated 10 bit digital-to-analog converter modeled using the analog hardware description language, Cadence-AHDL. Also, we applied the testability analysis at the circuit level using SPICE sensitivity analysis.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the relationship between output errors and component errors (faults) cannot be easily determined for analog circuits. In the case where the component error is small as in mismatches or small variations in component parameters, a linear error model can be used <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> In Section 4, behavioral simulation and modeling for testability analysis will be discussed. Finally, experimental results are presented in Section 5, followed by a conclusion in Section 6. 2 Testability analysis For the linear error model <ref> [1] </ref>, errors can be diagnosed by solving the system of equations in (1) using linear regression [2] when certain conditions are met. Using linear regression, we compute the optimal least square estimate of component errors, c = (U U ) U s; (2) provided (U T U ) 1 exists.

Reference-contexts: In this case, U T U is singular, thus, not invertible. 2.1 Ambiguity groups Components whose sensitivity vectors are dependent are said to fall into the same ambiguity group <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. There can be more than one ambiguity group in a circuit. Each component can either be independent or belong to only one group for the obvious reason that if the component belongs to two groups, the union of the two groups is a group.

There can be more than one ambiguity group in a circuit. Each component can either be independent or belong to only one group for the obvious reason that if the component belongs to two groups, the union of the two groups is a group. <p> The testability of a circuit decreases with the number of ambiguity groups and the number of components in each group. Thus, given a sensitivity matrix, U , the goal in testability analysis is to find the collection of ambiguity groups. In <ref> [5] </ref>, the groups are found by testing if sensitivity vectors are dependent two vectors at a time, then three vectors at a time, and so on until the CPU time limit is exceeded. Due to the exponential complexity of such brute force approach, its usefulness is limited.

Reference-contexts: They are used to decrease the design time of analog circuits. For instance, in top-down design, designers can explore system behavior quickly without investing time in actual implementation of the components; thus, allowing rapid design space explorations <ref> [6] </ref>. In bottom-up verifications, designers can verify system implementations quickly because behavioral models are usually simple and quick to evaluate [7]. In fault diagnosis, designers are interested in finding components errors in systems such as current mirror mismatches in DAC or comparator offsets in ADC.
