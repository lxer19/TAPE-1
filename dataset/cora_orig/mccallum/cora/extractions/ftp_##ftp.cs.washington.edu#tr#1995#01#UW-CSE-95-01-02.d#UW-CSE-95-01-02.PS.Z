Abstract: In computer graphics and geometric modeling, shapes are often represented by triangular meshes. With the advent of laser scanning systems, meshes of extreme complexity are rapidly becoming commonplace. Such meshes are notoriously expensive to store, transmit, render, and are awkward to edit. Multiresolu-tion analysis offers a simple, unified, and theoretically sound approach to dealing with these problems. A multiresolution representation of a mesh consists of a simple base mesh together with a sequence of local corrections of decreasing magnitude. By omitting small correction terms we can efficiently construct approximations with fewer triangles for compact storage and fast transmission and rendering. When editing meshes it is often desirable to modify the gross shape without affecting surface details. We can accomplish this by modifying terms in the approximation with large spatial extent. Lounsbery et al. have recently developed a technique for creating multiresolution representations for a restricted class of meshes with subdivision connectivity. Unfortunately, meshes encountered in practice typically do not meet this requirement. In this paper we present a method for overcoming the subdivision connectivity restriction, meaning that completely arbitrary meshes can now be converted to multiresolution form. The method is based on the approximation of an arbitrary initial mesh M by a mesh M J that has subdivision connectivity and is guaranteed to be within a specified tolerance. Multiresolution approximation of an arbitrary mesh thus proceeds in two steps: in the first step we approximate M by M J , and in the second step we convert M J to a multiresolution representation using the methods of Lounsbery et al.

Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [3] </ref> have demonstrated how wavelet representations of B-spline curves and tensor product surfaces can be used to achieve similar benefits. The main advantage of our method is its ability to deal with shapes of arbitrary topological type.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis offers a promising new approach for addressing these difficulties in a simple, unified, and theoretically sound way. A multiresolution representation of a mesh (Color Plate 1 (e)), as recently developed by Lounsbery et al. <ref> [10] </ref>, consists of a simple base mesh (Color Plate 1 (d)) together with a sequence of local correction terms, called wavelet coefficients, capturing the detail present in the object at various resolutions. Color Plates 1 (f)-(i) show a sequence of intermediate resolution models incorporating an increasing number of wavelets. <p> Color Plates 4 (e) and (f) show edits of a mesh at low and high levels of detail. Although the multiresolution analysis of Lounsbery et al. <ref> [10] </ref> can be applied to meshes of arbitrary topological type, it has a serious shortcoming: it is restricted to meshes with subdivision connectivity, that is, to meshes obtained from a simple base mesh by recursive 4-to-1 splitting (see from recursively splitting the faces of an octahedron five times. <p> mesh M thus proceeds in two steps: we first use remesh-ing to approximate M by a mesh M J with subdivision connectivity, and then use the method of Lounsbery et al. to convert M J to multiresolution representation. (Although we cannot reproduce here all the results of Lounsbery et al. <ref> [10] </ref>, we have included a brief summary in Appendix A.) The key ingredient of the remeshing procedure | and the principal technical contribution of the paper | is the construction of a homeomorphism between M and a mesh K 0 possessing a small number of faces.

Reference-contexts: The main advantage of our method is its ability to deal with shapes of arbitrary topological type. Finally, the problem of parametrizing meshes has recently been considered by Maillot et al. <ref> [11] </ref> in the context of texture mapping. However, the parametrizations they construct are not useful for our purpose: their surface tiles are not triangular, and their local parametrizations do not fit together continuously. <p> Others have developed similar approaches to embedding disk-like regions. One such approach, described by Kent et al. [8], is also based on minimizing the energy of a network of springs. They choose spring constants to be either all equal or inversely proportional to edge lengths. Maillot et al. <ref> [11] </ref> introduced another functional, also based on elasticity theory. the region D (see Figure 3 (a)) is a triangulation of a planar polygon P and g : @D ! @P is the identity. The harmonic map (Figure 3 (b)) is the identity map and therefore has no metric distortion.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, finding the shortest paths between two points on a mesh is itself a difficult problem <ref> [13] </ref>. Rather than connecting points using shortest paths, we instead use an approximation based on harmonic maps. The minimum metric distortion property of harmonic maps generally results in relatively short (and hence relatively straight) polygonal curves on M that are guaranteed not to cross.

Reference-contexts: It is thus a measure of metric distortion. In addition to minimizing metric distortion, the harmonic map h has a number of important properties: (i) It is infinitely differentiable on each face of D; (ii) it is an embedding <ref> [16] </ref>; and (iii) it is independent of the triangulation of D. Because h : D ! P is an embedding, the inverse h 1 is a parametrization of D over P .
