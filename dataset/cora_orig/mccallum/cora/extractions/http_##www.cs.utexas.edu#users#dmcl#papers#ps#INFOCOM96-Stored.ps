Abstract: In this paper, we present a network service specifically designed for multimedia servers. It uses a histogram based traffic characterization and an overload control protocol to eliminate packet losses in the network while providing heterogeneous statistical QoS. The key contribution of our protocol lies in combining open-loop and feedback-based control to: (1) provide heterogeneous QoS to clients in networking environments consisting of switches that may not have any scheduling support; and (2) migrate the functionality of discarding packets, in the event of congestion, to the sources which understand the semantics of the data. The protocol is efficient, makes very few assumptions about the underlying network, is realizable on current switching hardware (supporting FCFS scheduling), and is completely integrated with the architecture of a multimedia server.

Reference-contexts: That is, the following set of inequalities must hold: 8j 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : P i=j X X i &gt; C q j (1) Clearly, to evaluate the above set of inequalities, the distribution function of random variable Y j = P i=j required. <p> Since X i 's are independent, discrete random vari ables, the distribution of Y j can be derived using: 8j 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : Z (Y j ) = i=1 where Z (X ) denotes the z-transform of a discrete random variable X . <p> A server can then exploit the semantic knowledge of a video sequence to reduce the spatial, temporal, or chroma resolution, and thereby completely eliminate packet loss in the network <ref> [1] </ref>. The key requirements for an efficient and feasible implementation of such an overload control mechanism are: * The rate changes at a server must be required at most at a round boundary.

Reference-contexts: To meet this requirement, a source sends the bit rate required in the first W +2 rounds in the connection establishment message. The connection establishment procedure, in our protocol, is assumed to be the same as in <ref> [2] </ref> with the admission control criteria being replaced by our algorithm. Since overload can not be controlled during the first W + 1 rounds of a source, we require that a connection establishment request returns with the available rates for the first W + 1 rounds.

Reference-contexts: Rate is reduced equally from all sources that have the same loss probability. Though a naive implementation of the above algorithm would have O (N 2 ) complexity, an implementation that exploits the special structure of the inequalities has O (N ) complexity and is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. As Theorem 1 shows, the above algorithm finds an optimal solution (proof is presented in [4]). <p> Though a naive implementation of the above algorithm would have O (N 2 ) complexity, an implementation that exploits the special structure of the inequalities has O (N ) complexity and is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. As Theorem 1 shows, the above algorithm finds an optimal solution (proof is presented in [4]). <p> Our experiments and some of the results reported in [5] demonstrate that this as sumption holds for a simple scheduling discipline like FCFS. The protocol employs traffic shaping and, hence, the initiation latency may increase, an upper bound for which has been derived in <ref> [4] </ref> but omitted here due to space con straints. 4 Salient Features of Our Protocol The protocol that we have presented is not only simple and realizable in current hardware, but also has several desirable features: * The overload control algorithm assigns rates as per desired QoS of sources and provides <p> The link scheduling algorithm was assumed to be FCFS. The complete protocol was implemented in the simulator and was evaluated using 6 MPEG video sequences, each consisting of about 10000 frames, derived from a variety of video sources including television serials, newscasts, movies and cartoons <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The network assigns the minimum of the desired and available rate. Though the concept of allocating variable rate are the same in RCBR and our protocol, a key difference is that RCBR does not have any mechanism to provide heterogeneous QoS (see <ref> [4] </ref> for a detailed comparison). In RCBR, the network just allows a source to renegotiate a rate. It is the responsibility of a source to demand higher bandwidth than it may actually require to decrease the probability of renegotiation failure, and thereby receive better QoS.

Reference-contexts: As the sources are smooth and piecewise constant bit rate, we expect this assumption to be valid. Our experiments and some of the results reported in <ref> [5] </ref> demonstrate that this as sumption holds for a simple scheduling discipline like FCFS.

Reference-contexts: As it demonstrates, the maximum average buffer (average computed over 100ms) as well as the maximum buffer requirement is much higher than 9 packets that were required when traffic shaping was employed. Recently, Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate (RCBR) has been independently proposed as a service for video traffic <ref> [6] </ref>. In RCBR, a source transmits at a constant rate and explicitly requests the network to assign a new rate when the data rate of the source deviates significantly from the current assigned rate. The network assigns the minimum of the desired and available rate.

Reference-contexts: a round typically consists of several frame intervals and is of the order of a second, this significantly reduces the computational complexity of scheduling at network interface card as compared to other traffic shaping mechanisms in which the network interface card schedule may have to be changed every frame interval <ref> [7] </ref>. 5 Experimental Evaluation To experimentally evaluate the various aspects of the algorithms and protocol, we have carried out extensive trace driven simulations using an enhanced version of the REAL network simulator (available from the University of Cal-ifornia at Berkeley).

Reference-contexts: network provides multiple priority levels and if the source employs a multi-layer encoder, then the reconstructed image quality at the receiver can be improved by transmitting layers of the encoded video stream at different priority levels (e.g., transmitting the essential and the enhancement layers at high and low priorities, respectively) <ref> [8] </ref>. Though such methods may be appropriate for live video sources where overload can not be predicted a priori, protocols that are optimized for stored video communication can exploit predictability of the bit rate requirement to completely avoid any packet loss in the network.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments demonstrated that the maximum queue length at the link between switch 2 and switch 3 is always less then 9 packets. Similar results from many other experiments that we had conducted validate our conjecture. 5.3 Comparison with other schemes It has been suggested in <ref> [9] </ref> that a histogram of frame sizes of stored video can be used to model the video traffic. Such a characterization of the traffic would not require any traffic shaping and have smaller end-to-end delay.

Reference-contexts: Observe that this transmission method does periodic averaging of a video source and generates a piecewise constant bit rate traffic <ref> [11] </ref>. Moreover, it enables a multimedia server to succinctly capture the variations in the bit rate requirement of a video sequence.

Reference-contexts: Among these data types, motion video is the most demanding in terms of its size and real-time performance requirements. Several projects have recently investigated techniques for storage and retrieval of video streams from disk arrays <ref> [12] </ref>. However, techniques for efficient transmission of stored video over high-speed networks have not been adequately investigated. Variable bit rate (VBR) video data has multiple time-scale variations, i.e., bit rate requirement varies over millisecond, second and minute time-scales [3]. <p> Section 5 presents the results of our experiments, and finally, Section 6 summarizes our results. 2 Traffic Characterization and Admis sion Control Algorithm A multimedia server organizes the storage of video streams on disk arrays in terms of fixed size media blocks <ref> [12] </ref>. Due to the periodic nature of the video playback, the server can service retrieval requests from clients by proceeding in fixed duration rounds. In a round, a server retrieves fixed number of media units (video frames) sufficient to sustain playback for the duration of the round for each client. <p> Finally, such a histogram based characterization of data rate requirement is also necessary for implementing admission control at the multimedia server <ref> [12] </ref>. Hence, the traffic characterization method does not impose any additional requirement on the server. 2.2 Admission Control Algorithm Given a histogram-based traffic characterization, precise formulation of an admission control algorithm depends on the QoS parameters (end-to-end packet delay, delay jitter and packet loss probability) desired by the sources. <p> For the purpose of the simulation, QoS 7.3 x 10 3 2.3 x 10 3 5.7 x 10 4 Table 1 : QoS provided by the overload control algorithm we chose W = 1 and the round length T to be 1 second <ref> [12] </ref>. 5.1 Admission Control the achievable utilization is 56.1% when all sources require deterministic service, the utilization increases to as high as 88.6% when 72 sources requiring a loss probability of 10 4 are multiplexed.
