Reference-contexts: We use such estimates for the prevalence of the condition of interest in general populations and to study the sensitivity of p to the predictor variables, or, if possible, to combinations of them. The traditional GLIM models <ref> [1] </ref> do this by defining f (t), the logit, as f (t) = log [p (t)=(1 p (t))] (1:1) and assuming that f is a simple parametric function of the components of t. <p> The components are uniquely determined given a set of averaging operators E ff , which average functions over the t ff in some specified way. For example, if t ff is a continuous variable in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then a possible choice for E ff is (E ff f )(t 1 ; ; t ff1 ; t ff+1 ; ; t d ) = 0 Then the mean is = Q d ff=1 E ff f, the main effects are f ff = (I E ff ) <p> We carry out four analyses, each of which illustrates some particular feature of this class of models. In each case we have rescaled the (continuous) predictor variables t 1 ; ; t d to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and we use the averaging operator E = E ff defined in (1.9). We consider only main effects and two factor interactions. We employ the penalty functional J ff of (1.7) and a two dimensional relative J fffi defined below. <p> We require some definitions to define the terms in the particular ANOVA decomposition (1.8) that we use. Define the (linear) `trend' function (u) = u 1=2 for u 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and, for continuous functions g defined on [0; 1] let Bg stand for Bg = g (1) g (0). For future reference note that E R 1 0 (u)du = 0 and B = 1. We use E and B to define ANOVA and identifiability side conditions. <p> We require some definitions to define the terms in the particular ANOVA decomposition (1.8) that we use.

Reference-contexts: The analysis here is based on (a special case of) the smoothing spline ANOVA method for modeling and estimating f that appears in Wahba, Wang, Gu, Klein and Klein [2](WWGKK), and we have implemented the analysis via the publicly available code GRKPACK described in Wang <ref> [3] </ref>. The code itself is available from netlib@research.att.com in the gcv directory there, and through statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu. 2 Using SS-ANOVA to examine risk factors Wang, Wahba, Gu, Klein and Klein An SS-ANOVA estimate is a form of penalized likelihood estimate. <p> f containing interaction terms as in (1.8) have a representation as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms in the model plus n (basis) functions, that we can construct from the t (i), the reproducing kernels associated with the penalty functionals, and the smoothing parameters, see [12] [13] [4] [14][11] <ref> [3] </ref>. Given the smoothing parameters, the numerical problem of computing the minimizer f reduces to finding the coefficients of a representation for it as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms and the above mentioned basis functions. <p> The mathematics behind the representation of f , the numerical method for the minimization of I , the data-based choice of according to the iterative unbiased risk method, and the calculation of the confidence intervals are described in WWGKK. Further details appear in <ref> [3] </ref> and the documentation for GRKPACK. In the four analyses that we carry out 8 Using SS-ANOVA to examine risk factors Wang, Wahba, Gu, Klein and Klein below, there are between d = 2 and d = 4 predictor variables.

Reference-contexts: In this work we use the Bayesian `confidence intervals' proposed in [25], adapted to the component-wise multiple smoothing parameter case in <ref> [7] </ref>, to non-Gaussian data [26], and to the multiple smoothing parameter non-Gaussian case in [19] and WWGKK.

Reference-contexts: These splines are useful in many contexts, and one can incorporate them in an SS-ANOVA model [6][7]; we do not employ them in the present work. Hastie and Tibshirani <ref> [8] </ref> (see also other references there) discussed estimates of f of the form f (t) = f (t 1 ; ; t d ) = + ff=1 where the f ff are `smooth' functions obtained by some smoothing process, including the use of cubic smoothing splines. <p> We employ the penalty functional J ff of (1.7) and a two dimensional relative J fffi defined below. If we eliminated all of the two factor interactions, then the models described immediately below reduce to the form (1.5) as studied by Hastie and Tibshirani <ref> [8] </ref>, although our estimation method is different. We require some definitions to define the terms in the particular ANOVA decomposition (1.8) that we use.

Reference-contexts: The S code (Chambers and Hastie <ref> [9] </ref>) provides the facility for fitting models of the form (1.5).

Reference-contexts: Penalized likelihood methods with more general penalty functionals and unpenalized terms are discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>. Recent research has focussed on more general models for f that allow the explicit modeling and visualization of possible interactions between variables, via functional analysis of variance decompositions (to be described) and SS-ANOVA estimation methods. <p> We can also incorporate in the model indicator functions for categorical variables. Other averaging operators include weighted sums over possible or observed values of t ff . It is well known <ref> [11] </ref> that solutions to variational problems like the minimizer of I (y; f) and generalizations to I (y; f ) with f containing interaction terms as in (1.8) have a representation as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms in the model plus n (basis) functions, that we can construct from

Reference-contexts: Objective methods for choosing the smoothing parameters are desirable. This paper and the code GRKPACK employ the iterative unbiased risk method given in Gu [15][16] for the non-Gaussian case and extended to the p smoothing parameter case = ( 1 ; ; p ) in Wang <ref> [19] </ref> and WWGKK. This method is a computable proxy for the Kullback-Liebler information distance from the estimate to the `truth', see [16][20] [2][21]. <p> In this work we use the Bayesian `confidence intervals' proposed in [25], adapted to the component-wise multiple smoothing parameter case in [7], to non-Gaussian data [26], and to the multiple smoothing parameter non-Gaussian case in <ref> [19] </ref> and WWGKK. <p> None of the SS-ANOVA models built for WESDR data in this paper can be easily well approximated by a parametric GLIM model. Some SS-ANOVA models (for example, incidence in the younger onset group in <ref> [19] </ref>) can be reduced to parametric GLIM models. Therefore the same conclusions can be reached if appropriate terms are included in the parametric GLIM model. Even in these cases SS-ANOVA methods are very useful in deciding the appropriate terms.

Reference-contexts: At this writing a third followup is currently in progress. Detailed descriptions of the data have appeared in <ref> [27] </ref> and [28] and references there. In brief, a sample of 2990 diabetic patients was selected in an 11-county area in southern Wisconsin. This sample consisted of two groups. <p> We decided to delete this influential observation. Our conclusions would remain the same if we included this observation in the analysis. Klein et al <ref> [27] </ref> found, using linear logistic models, that glycosylated hemoglobin is the only statistically significant predictor of incidence of retinopathy in older onset patients. <p> Klein et al <ref> [27] </ref> found that age, duration, and glycosylated hemoglobin were statistically significant in a linear logistic model. Using linear logistic models, we found that the duration main effect of polynomials up to the cubic is significant and the bmi main effect of polynomials up to the quartic is significant. <p> Furthermore, we can use the SS-ANOVA method as a diagnostic tool [37]. After deleting participants with missing data, there were 374 participants in the older onset ID group qualified for inclusion in the analysis for `Progression'. Klein et al <ref> [27] </ref> found that age, duration, glycosylated hemoglobin and base-retinopathy-level are significant using a linear logistic model. They concluded that the risk of progression is higher if duration is longer and if base-retinopathy-level is lower (less severe). <p> The estimates of fl 2 , fl 3 , fl 4 , fl 5 and their posterior standard deviations (inside parentheses) are 0.73 (0.35), -0.68 (0.37), -1.05 (0.40) and -0.17 (0.51). Our conclusions basi cally agree with Klein et al <ref> [27] </ref> with the following modifications: 1. The risk of progression of retinopathy increases with increasing duration of diabetes up to around 8 years and does not increase after that; 2. The effect of body mass index is small; 3.

In brief, a sample of 2990 diabetic patients was selected in an 11-county area in southern Wisconsin. This sample consisted of two groups. The first group was 1210 patients diagnosed as diabetic before they were 30 years of age and who took insulin ("younger onset group"). <p> This sample size is probably not large enough to estimate interactions well. Klein et al <ref> [28] </ref> found that age and glycosylated hemoglobin are significant using a linear logistic model.

Reference-contexts: The risk decreases with increasing age for higher glycosylated hemoglobin. This decrease may result from mortality since an old participant with high glycosylated hemoglobin has a higher mortality risk during the observation period <ref> [36] </ref>. 4 PROGRESSION OF THE OLDER ONSET GROUP NOT TAKING INSULIN After excluding participants with missing values, there were 432 participants in the older onset NID group qualified for inclusion in the `Progression' analysis.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, we can obtain some marginal estimates on pairs of 2 or more covariates to investigate their interactions. Furthermore, we can use the SS-ANOVA method as a diagnostic tool <ref> [37] </ref>. After deleting participants with missing data, there were 374 participants in the older onset ID group qualified for inclusion in the analysis for `Progression'. Klein et al [27] found that age, duration, glycosylated hemoglobin and base-retinopathy-level are significant using a linear logistic model.
