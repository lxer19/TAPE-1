Abstract: As the sound speed is infinite for incompressible flows, computation of the pressure constitutes the stiffest component in the time advancement of unsteady simulations. For complex geometries, efficient solution is dependent upon the availability of fast solvers for sparse linear systems. In this paper we develop a Schwarz precondi-tioner for the spectral element method using overlapping subdomains for the pressure. These local subdomain problems are derived from tensor products of one-dimensional finite element discretizations and admit use of fast diagonalization methods based upon matrix-matrix products. In addition, we use a coarse grid projection operator whose solution is computed via a fast parallel direct solver. The combination of overlapping Schwarz preconditioning and fast coarse grid solver provides as much as a fourfold reduction in simulation time over previously employed methods based upon deflation for parallel solution of multi-million grid point flow problems. 1. Introduction. We consider the problems encountered in large-scale spectral element simulations of unsteady incompressible flows. For

Reference-contexts: TUFO In the spectral element method [23, 29] the bases for X N and Y N are defined by tessellating the domain into K nonoverlapping subdomains, = [ K k=1 k , and representing functions within each subdomain in terms of tensor-product polynomials on a reference subdomain ^ = <ref> [1; +1] </ref> d . (We will refer to the k 's as subdomains to distinguish them from elements, which will be defined in the context of finite element preconditioners in the next section.) Each k is the image of the reference subdomain under a mapping: x k (r) 2 k =) <p> For the velocity space, we choose as a basis for lP N (r) the set of Lagrangian interpolants on the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GL) quadrature points in the reference domain: i 2 <ref> [1; +1] </ref>, i = 0; : : : ; N . <p> Within a given subdomain, every scalar field in lP N;K () is represented in the form f (x)j k = i=0 j=0 ij h i (r 1 )h j (r 2 ) r 1 ; r 2 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 ; where h i (r) 2 lP N (r) is the Lagrange polynomial satisfying h i ( j ) = ffi ij , and ffi ij is the Kronecker delta function. <p> FISCHER, N.I.

Kruse [20], this results in significantly lower iteration counts. 6.2. Three-dimensional hemisphere problem. We now consider parallel simulation of the three-dimensional flow arising from the interaction of a flat plate boundary layer with a hemispherical protuberance. This flow was studied experimentally by Acalar and Smith <ref> [1] </ref> and, at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, exhibits periodic shedding of hairpin vortices as evinced by the isotherms in the centerplane of the channel shown in Fig. 6.

Reference-contexts: Parallel coarse grid solver. Solution of the coarse grid problem has long been recognized as a bottleneck in parallel applications where communication costs are non-negligible, such as on networks of workstations or when the number of processors is large (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 12, 22, 34] </ref>). Since A 1 0 is full, each coarse grid solve requires an all-to-all communication, as every entry of the distributed input has a nontrivial impact on every output value.

Reference-contexts: Temporal discretization.

Reference-contexts: Here we abandon the flexible unstructured finite element (FEM) approach in favor of tensor-product forms for the local operators on the overlapping regions. The tensor-product forms admit the use of solvers based upon the fast diagonalization method (FDM) <ref> [7, 8, 31] </ref> that require only O (KN d ) storage and O (KN d+1 ) work per solve for problems in lR d discretized with K spectral elements of order N .

The present scheme is closely related to our earlier two-dimensional work in which local subdomain problems were based upon linear finite elements [17].

We note that the vertex-based coarse grid problems such as considered here nominally require communication in the restriction and prolongation steps because each vertex may be shared by many processors. These extra communications can be avoided by embedding them directly into the XX T computation. <p> In addition, there is fourfold improvement in the time per coarse grid solve for n = 5114, and twofold for n = 781.

Reference-contexts: Domain decomposition-based preconditioners are a natural choice for the spectral element method since the data is structured within a subdo-main but is otherwise unstructured.

Reference-contexts: Our experience indicates that 18 P.F. FISCHER, N.I. MILLER, AND H.M. TUFO the iteration count does eventually approach a bound, but only after many levels of refinement. We have investigated two possible solutions. The first, suggested by Widlund <ref> [38] </ref>, is to use more overlap on the (few) subdomains which have high aspect ratio. This reduces the iteration count while maintaining low CPU time [17]. The second is use of nonconforming spectral element methods, which remove these high aspect ratio subdomains altogether. As demonstrated by G.
