Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 245 Appeared in: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, 1994 Abstract In this work we describe experiments with eigen-faces for recognition and interactive search in a large-scale face database. Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10 3 ) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years considerable progress has been made on the problems of face detection and recognition, especially in the processing of "mug shots," i.e., head-on face pictures with controlled illumination and scale. The best results have been obtained for 2-D, view-based techniques based on either template matching (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]), or matching using "eigenfaces," i.e. template matching using the Karhunen-Loeve transformation of a set of face pictures (e.g., [10, 11, 5]). However to date tests of these methods have been confined to datasets of only a few hundred images. <p> In the high-dimensional vector space of an input image, multiple-orientation training images are represented by a set of M distinct regions, each defined by the scatter of N individuals. Multiple views of a face form non-convex (yet connected) regions in image space <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore the resulting ensemble is a highly complex and non-separable manifold. The parametric eigenspace attempts to describe this ensemble with a projection onto a single low-dimensional linear subspace (corresponding to the first n eigenvectors of the N M training images).

However to date tests of these methods have been confined to datasets of only a few hundred images. <p> More surprising, perhaps, is the observation that in the lower dimensions of eigenspace, eigenfeatures outperformed the eigenface recognition. Finally, by using the combined representation, we gain a slight improvement in the asymptotic recognition rate (98%). A similar effect has recently been reported by Brunelli and Poggio <ref> [2] </ref> where the cumulative normalized correlation scores of templates for the face, eyes, nose and mouth showed improved performance over the face-only templates. A potential advantage of the eigenfeature layer is the ability to overcome the shortcomings of the standard eigen-face method.

Reference-contexts: One can view this architecture as a set of parallel "observers" each trying to explain the image data with their set of eigenvectors (see also Darrell and Pentland <ref> [3] </ref>.) In this view-based, multiple-observer approach, the first step is to determine the location and orientation of the target object by selecting the eigenspace which best describes the input image. This is accomplished by calculating the residual description error (the "distance-from-face-space" metric [11]) using each viewspace's eigenvectors.

Reference-contexts: In addition to head detection and tracking, automatic detection of facial features is also an important component for face recognition. Over the years, various strategies for facial feature detection have been proposed, ranging from the early work of Kanade with edge-map projections <ref> [4] </ref>, to more recent techniques using generalized symmetry operators [9] and multilayer perceptrons [12]. By far, the standard detection paradigm in computer vision is that of simple correlation or template matching. The eigenspace formulation, however, leads to a powerful alternative to simple template matching.

Reference-contexts: In a statistical signal detection framework, the use of eigen 3 (a) templates has been shown to yield superior performance in comparison with standard matched filtering <ref> [6] </ref>. In the eigenfeature representation the equivalent "distance-from-feature-space" (DFFS) can be effectively used for the detection of facial features. Given an input image, a feature distance-map is built by computing the DFFS at each pixel.

Reference-contexts: Although the application reported in this paper is that of face recognition, the same techniques can be applied to recognition and detection of most rigid, roughly convex objects. The general applicability of eigenvector decomposition methods for appearance-based 3D object recognition has recently been convincingly demonstrated by Murase and Nayar <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 A large face database To date, most face recognition experiments have had at most a few hundred faces. Thus how face recognition performance scales with the number of faces is almost completely unknown. <p> In this way a single "parametric eigenspace" will encode both identity as well as viewing conditions. Such an approach, for example, has recently been used by Murase and Nayar <ref> [7] </ref> for general 3D object recognition. An alternative formulation is to build a "view-based" set of M separate eigenspaces, each capturing the variation of the N individuals in a common view.

Reference-contexts: Almost every person has at least two images in the database; several people have many images with varying expressions, headwear, facial hair, etc. 2.1 Photobook: an image database tool This database can be interactively searched using an X-windows browsing tool we have created called Photobook <ref> [8] </ref>. The user begins by selecting the types of faces they wish to examine; e.g., senior Caucasian males with mustaches, or adult Hispanic females with hats. This subset selection is accomplished using an object-oriented database to search through the face image annotations.

However to date tests of these methods have been confined to datasets of only a few hundred images. For real-world applications, we must be able to reliably discriminate among thousands of individuals. <p> It is therefore important to ask if we can extend these successful 2-D, view-based recognition approaches to large databases with more general viewing conditions. In this paper we first explore how the eigenface technique of Turk and Pentland <ref> [11] </ref> scales when applied to much larger recognition problems. We then generalize the approach to view-based and modular eigenspaces for detection and recognition. <p> This is accomplished by calculating the residual description error (the "distance-from-face-space" metric <ref> [11] </ref>) using each viewspace's eigenvectors. Once the proper viewspace is determined, the image is encoded using the eigenvectors of that viewspace, and then recognized. 3.1 View-based vs. parametric methods The main advantage of the parametric eigenspace method is its simplicity. <p> The eigenspace formulation, however, leads to a powerful alternative to simple template matching. The reconstruction error (or residual) of the principal component representation (referred to as the "distance-from-face-space" in the context of our earlier work <ref> [11] </ref>) is a an effective indicator of a match. The residual error is easily computed using the projection coefficients and signal energy. This detection strategy is equivalent to matching with eigen-templates and allows for a greater range of distortions in the input signal (including lighting, rotation and scale).

Reference-contexts: This modularity in face description also has distinct advantages for face coding in teleconferencing. For example, a layered representation consisting of the face and eigenmouths has recently been implemented for low bit-rate transmission of visual telephony by Welsh and Shah <ref> [13] </ref>. In section 5, we will demonstrate the potential utility of eigenfeatures for face recognition. 4.1 Detection of facial features An important pre-processing step in an eigenvector recognition system is that of registration.

Reference-contexts: Eye-movement studies indicate that these particular facial features represent important landmarks for fixation, especially in an attentive discrimination task <ref> [14] </ref>. Therefore we should expect an improvement in recognition performance by incorporating an additional layer of description in terms of facial features.
