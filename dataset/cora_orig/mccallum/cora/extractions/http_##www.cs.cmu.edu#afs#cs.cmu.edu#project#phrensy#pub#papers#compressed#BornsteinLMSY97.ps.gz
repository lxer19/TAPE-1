Reference-contexts: N -node bounded-degree networks known to be capable of routing and sorting deterministically in O (log N ) time are those that incorporate some form of expansion (i.e., expan sion functions of the form N E (G; k) (1 + *)k, for some fixed * &gt; 0) into their structures <ref> [1, 2, 13, 14, 23] </ref>. 1.4 Lower bounds based on embeddings Lower bounds on the bisection width and expansion of an N -node network H can often be proved by embedding the complete graph G = K N into H. <p> Proof: The lemma follows from the definition of `amenable'. Lemma 2.15 Let n &gt; 2, U be a connected component of B n <ref> [1; log n 1] </ref> and g = (A; A) a cut of B n s.t. L 0 N (U ) A and L log n N (U ) A. Then U is amenable w.r.t. g.

Reference-contexts: In particular, if each node in a set of k nodes holds a small piece of information, they can increase the number of nodes holding the information to k + N E (G; k) in a single step. Several load-balacing algorithms exploiting this property are reported in <ref> [7] </ref>. The expansion function can also be used to compare the computational powers of different networks.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, BW (CCC n ) n=2. For the cube-connected cycles network, Manabe, Hagihara, and Tokura <ref> [15] </ref> proved the converse, namely BW (CCC n ) n=2. The same approach can be used to show that BW (W n ) n. <p> Next, in Section 3 we present an original proof that the bisection width of the butterfly with wraparound, W n , is n. Although this result was proved previously by Manabe, Hagihara, and Tokura <ref> [15] </ref>, we include our proof because there is no English-language proof of this result in the literature. In Section 4 we prove upper and lower bounds on the edge- and node-expansion functions of W n and B n .
