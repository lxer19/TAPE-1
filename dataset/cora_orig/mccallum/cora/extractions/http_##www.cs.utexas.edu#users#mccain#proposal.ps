Reference-contexts: introduction of answer literals, they are made explicit. 4 standard practice to ask `Find' questions|such as "Who is a spy?"|by means of existential sentences of precisely this form. (For example, see <ref> [ Chang and Lee, 1973 ] </ref> , [ Green, 1969b ] , [ McDermott, 1987a ] , and [ Waldinger, 1987 ] .) In asking a `Find' question, one seeks to be told of a single individual (or a tuple of individuals) that satisfies the conditions stated in the question. 3 <p> With equality, this is not true. Although equality creates difficulties for the epistemic method of formalizing `Find' questions, no difficulties result from defining a contingent analogue of equality|a sort of first order indistinguishability relation|by means of the standard "equality axioms" (cf. <ref> [ Chang and Lee, 1973 ] </ref> , p. 167), i.e., the axioms of reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and substitution.

Reference-contexts: The concept of implicit belief is the appropriate notion for formulating `Find' questions for deductive question answering systems. 6 In the following, belief should always be understood as implicit belief. The KD45 system of modal logic ( <ref> [ Chellas, 1980 ] </ref> and [ Halpern and Moses, 1985 ] ) is a plausible logic of implicit belief. The characteristic axioms of propositional KD45 are the following: K. K (A B) (KA KB) 4. KA KKA Axiom K implies that one's (implicit) beliefs are closed under logical entailment. <p> Far from being objectionable, closure under logical consequence is required in a logic of implicit belief. 7 S5 is simpler than KD45 because the accessibility relation between possible worlds (see <ref> [ Chellas, 1980 ] </ref> ) in S5 model structures is an equivalence relation and may be dropped without affecting validity. (Every world becomes accessible to every other world.) The accessibility relation in KD45, by contrast, is serial, transitive, and euclidean. 11 A is false. <p> This method of translation is an extension of a well-known method of translating propositional S5 modal logic to first order logic (cf. <ref> [ Chellas, 1980 ] </ref> , p. 13). The translation is correct if and only if it preserves validity. Conjecture 1 Let A be a KL formula. j= A iff j= F OL T r (A) We anticipate that Conjecture 1 can be proved in the following two steps.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of formalizing `Find' questions, we require a quantified version of S5 modal logic (cf. [ Hughes and Cresswell, 1968 ] ). Let us call this logic KL. A first order language <ref> [ Enderton, 1972 ] </ref> is defined by the set P S of its predicate symbols and the set F S of its function symbols (including its constant symbols, which are zero-ary function symbols). <p> Second, we expect that it can be shown that, if equality is absent from the two-sorted language, the distinction between sorts may be ignored. (There are general methods for reducing a many-sorted language to a one-sorted language (for example, see <ref> [ Enderton, 1972 ] </ref> , pp. 279-281). However, these methods introduce additional complexity into the axioms, which in the absence of equality we hope can be avoided.) Because these proofs have not been carried out, for the moment the correctness of the translation must be presented as a conjecture.

Reference-contexts: Yes-No questions, on the other hand, are posed by sentences which do not quantify into the scope of K, as in (3) and (4).

If a deductive question answering system is to answer questions about what it believes, it must somehow acquire such information.

Reference-contexts: Making this assumption renders the axiom T acceptable after all and justifies the use of an S5 modal logic rather than one based on KD45. For the purpose of formalizing `Find' questions, we require a quantified version of S5 modal logic (cf. <ref> [ Hughes and Cresswell, 1968 ] </ref> ). Let us call this logic KL.

Reference-contexts: A host of different axiomatic systems were investigated, but it was not until the development of possible worlds semantics in the latter part of the 1950's (especially by Kripke <ref> [ Kripke, 1959 ] </ref> ) that the study of modal logics came of age. The earliest systems of modal logic were logics of necessity, possibility, and strict implication.

Reference-contexts: Only the interpretation of predicate symbols is permitted to vary among the possible worlds in a KL model. An expression which designates the same individual in every possible world is called a rigid designator (cf. Kripke's discussion in <ref> [ Kripke, 1972 ] </ref> ). By restricting KL models to those which interpret function symbols as constant functions of worlds, i.e., in the same way in every possible world, we guarantee that every term in a KL language|for a given variable assignment|is a rigid designator. <p> The fundamental reason for this is that equality (in the logical sense of identity) is not contingent (cf. <ref> [ Kripke, 1972 ] </ref> ). Equality holds of an individual and itself only if it holds necessarily, i.e., (8x)(8y)(x = y 2x = y).

In this context we are concerned primarily with the epistemic concepts, specifically with the logic of belief. It seems natural that the logic of belief should be connected with the logic of necessity, since the concepts are closely related in natural language.

Reference-contexts: Levesque <ref> [ Levesque, 1984a ] </ref> and Reiter [ Reiter, 1990 ] have previously proposed using a language of epistemic logic as an interface language for a knowledge base and a database system, respectively. <p> Relaxing this assumption raises, for example, the possibility of dialogues between the system and the questioner aimed at clarifying an answer (cf. [ Hintikka, 1976 ] and <ref> [ Levesque, 1984a ] </ref> ). (This work also lies in the future.) The expectation is that each of these problems might be addressed in a formal way within the framework of epistemic logic and possible worlds semantics. 24 The aims of the proposed research are theoretical in nature.

Reference-contexts: concepts of possibility and necessity are epistemic in this sense. 5 K (A^B) is logically equivalent to KA^KB in the epistemic logic KL defined in following section of this paper. 10 Let us say that a question answering system explicitly believes every sentence that it is told and implicitly believes <ref> [ Levesque, 1984b ] </ref> every sentence which follows from what it explicitly believes, i.e., which is epistemically necessary given what it explicitly believes. <p> Implicit belief, however, does not concern what an agent directly believes but what is implicit in what he believes, i.e., with "what the world would be like if what he believed were true" ( <ref> [ Levesque, 1984b ] </ref> , p. 198).

Reference-contexts: The approach advocated in this paper is to instead attempt to prove KA (9x)KQ (x). 5 The Epistemic Logic: KL For the first forty years, the study of modal logics was carried out by syntactic and proof theoretic means (see, for example, <ref> [ Lewis, 1918 ] </ref> and [ Lewis and Lang-ford, 1932 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Notice that the attempt to unify the argument lists of (i) and (ii) fails due to an occur check violation. As a practical matter, the problem of barring Skolem function symbols from answers to `Find' questions is easily solved by restricting the proof search. Waldinger and Manna <ref> [ Manna and Waldinger, 1987 ] </ref> have proposed the following method. They classify function symbols into two classes, "primitive" and "non-primitive." Furthermore, they stipulate that the proof search is to be constrained to permit only primitive function symbols in answers. <p> This is illustrated by the following dialogue in which the prohibition on K is violated. Statement: KSpy (P hilby) _ KSpy (T horpe) Question: (9x)KSpy (x) Answer: Yes, x = P hilby or T horpe 12 Waldinger and Manna <ref> [ Manna and Waldinger, 1987 ] </ref> use the term "rigid designator" to refer to terms which designate the same individuals in all situations. This usage is perfectly correct, but it differs from our usage, because situations and worlds are different things. <p> On the other hand, if the value of a will not be known by the time it is needed in executing the plan, then the plan is not executable. The problem of non-executable plans is discussed in <ref> [ Manna and Waldinger, 1987 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: If an object is disarmed it will remain disarmed if any object is put in the toilet. 4. If the bomb (whatever object it may be) is disarmed, the situation is safe. This problem can be formalized in the situation calculus of McCarthy and Hayes <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> . A situation is a complete state of the universe at an instant in time. A propositional fluent maps a situation to a truth value. Holds (f; s) states that the propositional fluent f is true in the situation s.

Reference-contexts: Translating KL into first order logic has the following advantage: It enables the use of standard techniques for first order theorem proving and the use of existing theorem provers, such as OTTER <ref> [ McCune, ] </ref> , which may be the product of a considerable development effort.

Reference-contexts: introduction of answer literals, they are made explicit. 4 standard practice to ask `Find' questions|such as "Who is a spy?"|by means of existential sentences of precisely this form. (For example, see [ Chang and Lee, 1973 ] , [ Green, 1969b ] , <ref> [ McDermott, 1987a ] </ref> , and [ Waldinger, 1987 ] .) In asking a `Find' question, one seeks to be told of a single individual (or a tuple of individuals) that satisfies the conditions stated in the question. 3 However, there is a difficulty. <p> Accordingly, QA3 may fail to answer the `Find' question, "Who is a spy?", even though it possesses sufficient information to do so. Failures such as this have led McDermott <ref> [ McDermott, 1987a ] </ref> to conclude that in the general case deduction is inadequate for finding answers. In certain expressively weak languages, such as the definite clause subset of first order logic|i.e., the language of Prolog|deduction may suffice for finding answers. <p> You receive two indistinguishable ticking objects in the mail, plus an anonymous phone call warning that exactly one of them is a bomb. From old movies you know that putting a bomb in the toilet is a sure-fire way to disarm it. What should you do? ( <ref> [ McDermott, 1987a ] </ref> , p. 10) The correct answer is to put both objects in the toilet. Let us agree to distill the information in the `Bomb in the Toilet' problem into the following four facts. 1. <p> Moore [ Moore, 1987 ] makes a similar point, and, as a practical matter, this is correct. However, such solutions already concede to McDermott the main point of his critique (although McDermott was less than clear about this in <ref> [ McDermott, 1987a ] </ref> ), namely, that logic and deduction alone are inadequate to answer `Find' questions.

There is also a "mention-all" interpretation in which a question such as "Who is a spy?" is taken to request the list of all spies.

Reference-contexts: The significance of "quantifying in" is a topic which has received considerable discussion in the philosophical literature (e.g., see [ Hintikka, 1971 ] , [ Kaplan, 1971 ] , and <ref> [ Quine, 1966 ] </ref> ). If a deductive question answering system is to answer questions about what it believes, it must somehow acquire such information. Specifically, it must acquire the information that it believes each of the statements that it is told.

Reference-contexts: Levesque [ Levesque, 1984a ] and Reiter <ref> [ Reiter, 1990 ] </ref> have previously proposed using a language of epistemic logic as an interface language for a knowledge base and a database system, respectively. The distinction between ques 23 tions that are expressed by quantifying in and those which are not was exploited in this work.

Reference-contexts: This characteristic, which is commonly known as the assumption of logical omniscience, is generally thought to be highly unrealistic (but see Stalnaker's defense in <ref> [ Stalnaker, 1984 ] </ref> ). Implicit belief, however, does not concern what an agent directly believes but what is implicit in what he believes, i.e., with "what the world would be like if what he believed were true" ( [ Levesque, 1984b ] , p. 198).

Reference-contexts: introduction of answer literals, they are made explicit. 4 standard practice to ask `Find' questions|such as "Who is a spy?"|by means of existential sentences of precisely this form. (For example, see [ Chang and Lee, 1973 ] , [ Green, 1969b ] , [ McDermott, 1987a ] , and <ref> [ Waldinger, 1987 ] </ref> .) In asking a `Find' question, one seeks to be told of a single individual (or a tuple of individuals) that satisfies the conditions stated in the question. 3 However, there is a difficulty. <p> ) the problem is reported solved in QA3 in just this way: The theorem prover is told to discard any clause which contains two answer literals which cannot be unified.
