Reference-contexts: This mechanism enables the system to retrieve learning patterns of a particular subspace without excessive computational overhead. Since learning patterns are stored in bins at depth D, all nodes representing subspaces ~ l 2 U N [D] U N [D1] : : : U N <ref> [1] </ref> are created if they do not yet exist. The only function of nodes that are created on such occasion is to provide a path to a bin attached to a leaf node at depth D. These nodes are called virtual nodes.
