Abstract: An orthogonal basis of L 2 which is also an unconditional basis of a functional space F is a kind of optimal basis for compressing, estimating, and recovering functions in F . Simple thresholding operations, applied in the unconditional basis, work essentially better for compressing, estimating, and recovering than they do in any other orthogonal basis. In fact, simple thresholding in an unconditional basis works essentially better for recovery and estimation than other methods, period. (Performance is measured in an asymptotic minimax sense.) As an application, we formalize and prove Mallat's Heuristic, which says that wavelet bases are optimal for representing functions containing singularities, when there may be an arbitrary number of singularities, arbitrarily distributed.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless the unconditional basis property seems to have received little attention from applied mathematicians. Applied interest has instead focused on the fact that wavelet bases provide good data compression properties for certain types of signals and images <ref> [1, 5, 6, 7, 26] </ref>.

We give a simple example, which we shall return to frequently. Suppose we are interested in the class of functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of Bounded Variation ff : T V (f ) 1g. We expand functions in this class using the Haar basis. Let fi BV be the collection of Haar coefficients that result. <p> To go further, it is convenient to introduce the Besov bodies referred to earlier. Let = ( i ) be a collection of Haar coefficents, or, more generally, smooth wavelet coefficients for an expansion on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Writing out these entries in conventional terms, the first 2 j 0 entries in the vector are gross-structure coefficients (fi j 0 ;k ) k and then there is a collection of lists (ff j;k ) 2 j 1 k=0 for j 0. <p> In this connection, it is obvious that similar results hold for classes defined by constraints P p 2 (0; 2).) With slight, but fussy, modifications of the above treatment, we can define analogs S ff <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for the interval [0; 1] and S ff (T) for the circle. <p> In this connection, it is obvious that similar results hold for classes defined by constraints P p 2 (0; 2).) With slight, but fussy, modifications of the above treatment, we can define analogs S ff <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for the interval [0; 1] and S ff (T) for the circle. <p> Corollary 9 With ff = ff <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or ff = ff (T), p fl ( ff ) = 3=2 + ff For every orthogonal transformation U , p fl (U ff ) p fl ( ff ): The proof of the corollary is immediate. <p> 1+ff 1;1 (C 2 )) = 3=2 + ff In addition, p fl (U ff ) p fl (U fi 1+ff 1;1 (C 1 )) = p fl ( ff ): Hence, in a qualitative sense, wavelets cannot be outperformed by other orthogonal bases for representing functions in S ff <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or S ff (T). It is instructive to consider functions on the circle, and to compare bases of smooth periodic wavelets with the Fourier basis. <p> Almost certainly, real image data will not give rise to sets fi of wavelet coefficients which are well-modelled by orthosymmetric sets. Several groups (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) are currently experimenting with image and speech compression using orthogonal wavelet transforms. Experience indicates that coefficients of real objects will be correlated spatially and across levels. These correlations violate orthosymmetry.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we introduce the weak` p or Marcinkiewicz quasi-norm <ref> [2, page 7] </ref>. Let jj (k) again denote the k-th largest entry in the vector ( i ). Set jj w` p = sup k 1=p jj (k) : All three quasi-norms are equivalent, when r, m, and p are calibrated appropriately.

We are given a noiseless vector , and we wish to store only n machine words, where each word allows to store both a machine floating-point number and a machine integer. We wish to reconstruct accurately from the stored numbers. <p> De Vore, B. Jawerth, B. Lucier and V. Popov have written a number of papers recently on wavelet compression; see <ref> [7, 5, 6, 26] </ref>. The contact between those papers and the present one seems to be as follows. [7] defines fi t by the property that P n (n m c n ()) t =n C t , where t = 2=(2m + 1). <p> Because B t admits nice wavelet bases as unconditional bases, our slogan translates into the statement that no other orthogonal basis can perform essentially better than a nice wavelet basis for diagonal compression and recovery of classes built from B t . In contrast, <ref> [7, 5, 6, 26] </ref> seek results specifically for B t , and get finer results than we do here, with respect to various error criteria, and a variety of nonlinear procedures. 20 Acknowledgements.

Nevertheless the unconditional basis property seems to have received little attention from applied mathematicians. <p> These are functions f : T ! R which satisfy jf (t) f (u)j jt uj ff where subtraction is interpreted circularly. A smooth periodic wavelet orthonormal basis on the circle can be constructed which is an unconditional basis for this class <ref> [28] </ref>. The collection fi of wavelet expansions of members of fl ff is equivalent, to within constants, to a Besov Body fi ff 1;1 . Let U W F denote an operator mapping from Wavelet to Fourier coefficients. <p> Hence, for compression of Holder classes, wavelets have no convincing advantage over Fourier methods. A clue to this behavior is obtained by studying linear n-widths. Enumerate the periodic wavelet coefficients in the natural way, and set d n () = P i . Littlewood-Paley theory (e.g. <ref> [20, 28] </ref>) shows that d 2 j () for the periodic wavelet basis is basically equivalent to d 2 j (!). (This is very easy to see if the Meyer wavelet is employed.) Hence, for a wide variety of bodies fi and = U W F fi, d fl n ();

Reference-contexts: Similar comments apply to higher dimensional wavelect expansions. We are interested in three specific problems which are naturally posed in a sequence space, and in the behavior of coordinatewise nonlinearities for solving those problems. The first problem is one of Statistical Estimation <ref> [32, 22, 15] </ref>. We observe data y i = i + * z i , i = 1; 2; : : :, where the z i are i.i.d. <p> The cases of BV and S ff correspond to the case p = 1 which explains the advantages of wavelet bases in those cases. 11 Discussion 11.1 Theoretical Implications We sketch here an example of the implications one might take from this paper. Since the pioneering work of Pinsker <ref> [32] </ref> and Ibragimov and Has'minskii [22], there has been a considerable Soviet literature concerning the treatment of the statistical estimation model introduced here.
