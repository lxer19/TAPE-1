Reference-contexts: Although we do not want to suggest that humans have perfect or conscious metacognitive knowledge of, and control over, their learning processes, such a model could be used to take an intentional stance <ref> (Dennett, 1987) </ref> towards a computational theory of multistrategy reasoning, both as a description of human reasoning processes and as a basis for the design of creative AI systems. 40 The work reported in this article represents a theory of everyday conceptual change, which we have argued is creative in nature.

Reference-contexts: For example, a transfer is a generic action. Different types of transfers can be represented as physical (e.g., the PTRANS primitive of Schank, 1972), mental (e.g., MTRANS), and social (e.g., ATRANS). The grid also allows the system to represent emotional and temporal transfers <ref> (see also Domeshek, 1992) </ref>. Although it was developed independently, the grid bears a strong resemblance to the work of Chi (1993) and Carey (1992), both of whom attempt to discover the ontological relations inherent in human reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The mechanisms of conceptual change discussed here are an integral part of ordinary reasoning. Creative understanding in ISAAC is not implemented through a separate creativity process, but rather through normal processes of reasoning and learning <ref> (Gruber, 1989) </ref>. Similarly, conceptual change in SINS also occurs through the normal processes of perception and control of action.

Reference-contexts: Other learning goals may be selected based on a higher-level analysis of utility of knowledge and relevance to the system's tasks, such as in ISAAC, Meta-AQUA, IVY <ref> (Hunter, 1990) </ref>, and PAGODA (desJardins, 1992). These systems are better described as goal directed since goals are explicitly represented and used to drive the selection and execution of reasoning and learning strategies (Leake & Ram, 1993; Ram & Cox, 1994; Ram & Hunter, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Quine (1977) suggests that early concepts may be more perceptual, being defined inductively using an innate similarity notion or spacing of qualities, and later concepts may become more scientifically sophisticated, conceptual, and theory-embedded <ref> (see also Keil, 1989) </ref>. Quine was interested in the issue of development of natural kinds, but perhaps a similar idea could be used to integrate perceptual and conceptual change in an adult reasoning system. To facilitate integration, it is useful to look at commonalities between the models (see Table 2).

Reference-contexts: In addition to aiding in the reading process, the new concepts and theories can also provide a basis for future problem solving in the real world <ref> (e.g., Koestler, 1964) </ref>. For example, reading about a fictitious device may prompt the reader to develop a similar device in the real world, or may help the reader understand a similar device when it is actually encountered at some later point.

Reference-contexts: For example, many temporal metaphors can be represented as analogies between the physical and temporal columns of the grid <ref> (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) </ref>. In a sentence such as Time has passed her by, for example, a temporal event is described in physical terms, and an abstract object (time) is described as the agent of the physical action.

Reference-contexts: Some learning goals may be low-level and always active, such as in SINS and NX. These systems can be described as performing goal relevant learning, in that learning is relevant to the overall goals of the system <ref> (Thagard, discussed in Leake & Ram, 1993) </ref> but the system only has an implicit goal to learn (Barsalou, discussed in Leake & Ram, 1993). <p> These systems can be described as performing goal relevant learning, in that learning is relevant to the overall goals of the system (Thagard, discussed in Leake & Ram, 1993) but the system only has an implicit goal to learn <ref> (Barsalou, discussed in Leake & Ram, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The columns of the grid represent conceptual domains, such as physical, mental, social, emotional, and temporal. For example, a transfer is a generic action. Different types of transfers can be represented as physical <ref> (e.g., the PTRANS primitive of Schank, 1972) </ref>, mental (e.g., MTRANS), and social (e.g., ATRANS). The grid also allows the system to represent emotional and temporal transfers (see also Domeshek, 1992).
