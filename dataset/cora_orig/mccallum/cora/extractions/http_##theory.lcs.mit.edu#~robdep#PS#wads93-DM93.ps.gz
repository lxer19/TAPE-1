Abstract: Fault tolerance through the incorporation of redundancy and reconfiguration is quite common. In a redundant linear array of processing elements, k redundant links of fixed lengths are provided to each element of the array in addition to the regular links connecting neighboring processors. The redundant links may be activated to bypass faulty elements. The number and the distribution of faults can have severe impact on the effectiveness of such a method. In this paper we study the problem of deciding whether a pattern of n blocks of faults is catastrophic for a redundant array. We prove that, for arrays provided of bidirectional links, the problem requires time O(kn). In the unidirectional case we propose an algorithm whose complexity is O(n) when the array has only one redundant link, and O(kn log k) otherwise. When the pattern is not catastrophic we are interested to obtain a reconfiguration set and, in particular, an optimal reconfiguration set (i.e. one with maximal number of working elements). We prove that such a problem is NP-hard, when the links are bidirectional. For the unidirectional case, instead, we present an algorithm of complexity O(kng), where g is the length of the longest link.

Reference-contexts: Such sets of faults, called Catastrophic Fault Patterns, have been extensively studied in <ref> [1, 6, 7] </ref> but only for the specific case in which the number of faults in the pattern is exactly g, that is the length of the longest bypass link. For a fault pattern, having at least g faults, is a necessary condition to be catastrophic, see [4].

Reference-contexts: Lemma 4 The MRL problem is N P -complete. Proof. We reduce the problem of testing whether there exists an hamiltonian path between two given vertices of a graph (HP for short), that, notoriously is N P -complete (see <ref> [2] </ref>), to the MRL problem. Since it is easy to give a non deterministic polynomial time algorithm that solves the MRL problem we conclude that MRL is N P -complete. Let H = (V; E) be the input graph for the HP problem.

Reference-contexts: By Lemmas 1 and 2 it is sufficient to show that the algorithm GRAP H requires time O (kn) and the thesis will follow noting that connectivity in a graph H = (V; E) may be tested in time O (j V j + j E j), see for example <ref> [3] </ref>. Since the first for requires clearly O (n) time, we have simply to prove that a call of the routine ADJACEN CY requires time O (n). Let l i be the increment of the variable j at the i th iteration of the for in adjacency.

Reference-contexts: Making the realistic assumption that the length of the longest link is small with respect to the number of processing elements, regardless of any amount of redundancy, there are sets of faults occurring at strategic positions which affect the chip in an unrepairable way, see <ref> [4] </ref>. Such sets of faults, called Catastrophic Fault Patterns, have been extensively studied in [1, 6, 7] but only for the specific case in which the number of faults in the pattern is exactly g, that is the length of the longest bypass link. <p> For a fault pattern, having at least g faults, is a necessary condition to be catastrophic, see <ref> [4] </ref>. In [6] an O (g 2 ) algorithm is presented recognizing Catastrophic Fault Patterns consisting of g faults, for redundant arrays with a single bypass link of length g.
