Reference-contexts: Polygonal surface models of major blood vessels (descending aorta, carotid and subclavian arteries, etc.) were developed in-house based on reconstructions from CT-scan data using SPAMMVU and descriptions from anatomy texts <ref> [1, 21, 22] </ref>. The outer skin model currently in use is a polygonal mesh of a female torso. The torso model is a fixed size model of an "average" female.

Reference-contexts: The outer skin model currently in use is a polygonal mesh of a female torso. The torso model is a fixed size model of an "average" female. The three dimensional models used by the penetration path assessment system are displayed in Jack R fl <ref> [2] </ref>, a graphical system for displaying and animating both articulated and non-articulated figures given their polygonal surface representations.

Reference-contexts: a user can essentially "follow" a bullet or stab path through the 3D models of the organs and observe which organs lie in the path of the wound path space. 26 Chapter 5 Applications The penetration path assessment system is designed to work with the TraumAID [31, 35], and MediSim <ref> [3] </ref> systems developed at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which suggest actions that should be taken by medical personnel when faced with patients suffering from penetrating injuries.

Reference-contexts: Even experts might benefit from the system by having it confirm/disprove their notions about the spatial relationships among the different anatomical structures. This issue apparently does arise occasionally in medical practice as the case description below <ref> [14] </ref> illustrates: A patient presented to the Emergency Center with a knife embedded in the right lower paraspinal chest and no other abnormal physical findings on examination.

Reference-contexts: This can help in bridging the gap between knowledge of the anatomy involved in a particular injury and the physiological manifestations associated with that injury. 1.1 Penetration Path Assessment System Overview The penetration path assessment system is based on Leonard Karpf's ideas about model based penetration path calculations <ref> [23] </ref>. It extends this work by providing a graphical user interface with a 3D torso model on which injuries can be simulated, different injury hypotheses generated and assessed probabilistically, and by presenting the user with both visual (graphical) and written feedback about injury assessments. <p> To obtain such a detailed level of information about the anatomy, it would be necessary to use volumetric models for the anatomical structures rather than surface models. A drawback to using volumetric models is that representing anatomical structures would require a tremendous amount of data <ref> [23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: the binomial for cases where X 0:5 and nX &gt; 5 or X &gt; 0:5 and 11 n (1 X) &gt; 5 is a standard approach in statistics since it cuts down on the length of computation that would be involved in computing probabilities directly from the binomial distribution (see <ref> [27, 28, 34] </ref>). The confidence bounds for the hit probability are given by: 0 s n s n A (3:5) where n is the sample size (the total number of simulated trajectories) and ff=2 is the area under the standard normal density function from 1 to z ff=2 . <p> For on-screen display purposes, we write equation 3.5 as X z ff=2 X (1 X ) In order to produce a 95% confidence interval, ff is set to 0:05 and the corresponding value for z ff=2 = z 0:025 is 1:960 <ref> [27, 28] </ref>. The process of generating experimental trajectories for gunshot wounds differs slightly from that for stab wounds since the mechanisms of injury for both cases lead to different wound path space models (see figures 2.1 (a) and 2.2).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Penetrating trauma is responsible for a large proportion of civilian deaths in the United States and is a major cause of battlefield fatalities. There is evidence that early administration of expert care to victims of penetrating trauma would considerably reduce the number of deaths due to these injuries <ref> [36] </ref>. In dealing with penetrating injuries, physicians are generally concerned about the anatomical structures affected, as the types of injuries to vital structures could determine a patient's treatment and chances for survival.
