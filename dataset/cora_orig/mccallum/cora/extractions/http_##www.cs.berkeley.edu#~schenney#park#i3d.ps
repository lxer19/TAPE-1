Abstract: Scalable rendering of virtual environments requires culling objects that have no effect on the view. This paper explores culling moving objects by not solving the equations of motion of objects that don't affect the view. While this approach could be scalable for many kinds of environments, it raises two problems: consistency ensuring that objects that come back into view do so in the right state and completeness ensuring that objects that would have entered the view volume as a result of their motions, do so. Solutions to these problems lie in studying the statistics of the motion of objects. We show strategies for addressing the problem of consistency, with a number of examples that illustrate both the difficulties involved in, and the potential gains to be obtained by, formulating a comprehensive approach.

Reference-contexts: Instead we expect to find a set of techniques, each of which works for a class of dynamics, and apply those which best match the properties of a given system. One applicable technique is classical perturbation theory, as described in <ref> [1] </ref>, which models how systems behave over time when subjected to small perturbations in control. * Weak influence makes it difficult for a viewer to make any prediction about state based on their knowledge of initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: To achieve maximum scalability, the cost of computing dynamics should depend only on what is relevant to the view, not on the total size of the world. Level of detail [8] and visibility culling <ref> [2, 7] </ref> achieve scalability for static worlds by rendering only what is relevant. While Hodgins and Carlson [5] reduce the cost of dynamic simulation by using level of detail for hopping robots playing a chase-and-capture game, their approach requires distinct, hand generated models for the robot dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The Tilt-A-Whirls were placed such that the density of machines increased, not the size of the world. Note that the time spent on dynamics without culling varies because the integrator step length varies, which also contributes to the variations in slope. the OBBTree interference detection package as described in <ref> [3] </ref>, and are treated as impulses [4]. The bumper car system is influenced by an initial state for a long period of time. For time intervals where the dependence on initial conditions is strong, we rely on buffering methods.

Reference-contexts: While the models used here were hand generated, the existence of general solutions for commonly occurring systems suggests that much of the work required may be automated, possibly through the application of existing statistical methods for estimating the influence of initial conditions <ref> [10] </ref> and modeling distributions that appropriately reflect the behavior of systems over time.
