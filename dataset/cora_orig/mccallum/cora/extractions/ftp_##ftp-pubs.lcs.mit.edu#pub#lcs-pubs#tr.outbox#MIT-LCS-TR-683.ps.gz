Title: Translucent Cryptography An Alternative to Key Escrow, and its Implementation via Fractional Oblivious Transfer makes
Author: Mihir Bellare Ronald L. Rivest 
Note: This  
Date: February 18, 1996  
Abstract: We present an alternative to the controversial "key escrow" techniques for enabling law-enforcement and national security access to encrypted communications. Our proposal allows such access with probability p for each message, for a parameter p between 0 and 1 to be chosen (say, by Congress) to provide an appropriate balance between concerns for individual privacy, on the one hand, and the need for such access by law-enforcement and national security, on the other. For example, with p = 0:4, a law-enforcement agency conducting an authorized wiretap which records 100 encrypted conversations would expect to be able to decrypt (approximately) 40 of these conversations; the agency would not be able to decrypt the remaining 60 conversations at all. Different values of p can be chosen for different situations, such as for export. Our proposal can be combined with other ideas, such as secret-sharing, to provide additional flexibility. Our scheme is remarkably simple to implement, as it requires no prior escrowing of keys. We provide an efficient implementation of translucent cryptography. It is based on noninteractive oblivious transfer, as pioneered by Bellare and Micali [2], who showed how to transfer a message with probability 1=2. We provide means for non-interactive fractional oblivious transfer, which allows a message to be transmitted with any given probability p. Our protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman assumption and uses just one El Gamal encryption (two exponentiations), regardless of the value of the transfer probability p. fl An earlier version of this paper, by the second author, was titled "Translucent Cryptography: An Alternative to Key Escrow," and was presented at the Rump session of Crypto 95.

We would like, ideally, to be as efficient as the above schemes, and use just one encryption.

It is important to note that successive oblivious transfers are not independent: if Alice sends two successive messages using Larry's public key V , Larry either receives them both or receives neither of them. <p> The underlying issue of revelation of the secret index of a recipient in a NIOT based on some action of the recipient arose, and was recognized, in the context of implementing non-interactive zero-knowledge based on NIOT <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: With probability p this information allows Larry to determine the message key s, and thus to decrypt the first field to obtain the message m. The second field would typically consist of the encryption of s under Bob's public key, as is done for example in Privacy Enhanced Mail <ref> [18] </ref>. Bob can reliably decrypt this field to obtain s, and thus to decrypt the first field to obtain the message m. In a variation, the session key s would be encrypted in a DES key known only to Alice and Bob.
