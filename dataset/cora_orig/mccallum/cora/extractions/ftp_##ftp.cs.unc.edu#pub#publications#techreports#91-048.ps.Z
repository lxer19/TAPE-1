Reference-contexts: As the user moves and tilts his head, the HMD changes the images based on his head position and orientation, generating the illusion of being inside a virtual world. At SIGGRAPH 91, UNC demonstrated an electro-optical system that can track a users head inside a roomsized volume <ref> [Ward92] </ref>. It consists of a head-mounted unit, a 10 by 12 ceiling, and supporting hardware and software. The head-mounted unit has four camera-like devices, which we will call photodiode units, aimed toward the ceiling. Each photodiode unit contains a flat 10x10 mm 2 detector that is sensitive to infrared light.
