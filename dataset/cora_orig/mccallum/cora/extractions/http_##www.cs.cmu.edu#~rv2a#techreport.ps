Title: Conditional Modeling in an Equation-Based Environment

Abstract: We identify the modeling capabilities needed for the efficient representation of conditional models in an equation-based environment and describe modeling tools for the performance of each of these tasks: conditional configuration of a model structure, conditional compilation and conditional execution of procedural statements. We also describe the details of the computer implementation of these tools and show how the expressiveness of an equation-based modeling language increases with their incorporation. Several chemical engineering examples are presented to demonstrate the scope of application of the proposed extensions.

Reference-contexts: to model unit replacement when searching over a superstructure. 3 CONDITIONAL MODELING TOOLS Equation oriented modeling tools support the implementation of unit models and their incorporation in a model library by means of a declarative modeling language; declarative in the sense of explicit and symbolic, encapsulating the knowledge about models <ref> (Marquardt, 1996) </ref>. On the other hand, methods must also be attached to a model definition for the numerical processing of the model equations. <p> Instead, in this work we represent that conditional dependence by using an object oriented formalism. In an object oriented approach any real or abstract entity is considered an object and any object can be referenced by a unique identifier <ref> (Marquardt, 1996) </ref>. For instance, in an object oriented mathematical modeling language representing a model superstructure, a simple equation is considered as an object and so is any submodel within the superstructure.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, the equational-based modeling community has focused on the development of tools for the formal definition of models describing the behavior of process systems <ref> (Pantelides and Barton, 1993) </ref>. However, while many currently available equation-based modeling systems have been reported in the literature, only a few of them have given attention to conditional models (Pantelides, 1988; Piela,1989; Barton, 1992).

Reference-contexts: The main result of this effort has been the development of ASCEND <ref> (Piela et al., 1991) </ref>. ASCEND is both an object oriented mathematical modeling environment and a solving and debugging engine.
