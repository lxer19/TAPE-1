Abstract: Bayesian Networks are an extremely powerful and useful method for reasoning. However, surprisingly few people outside of a small community of Artificial Intelligence researchers actually have a working knowledge of Bayesian Networks. We describe in this paper our goal of enabling students to more readily use Bayesian Networks, the software tool we have developed to achieve this goal, and our motivation for the various design aspects of the tool.

Reference-contexts: Multiply-connected networks require several more steps than singly-connected networks before they are ready for evaluation. The software automati cally forms a junction tree of belief universes (com-binations of nodes), using algorithms developed by Anderson, Jensen et al <ref> [1] </ref> [6] and Draper [5]. The onset of each step in this process is flagged by text that students may click on to continue with the process or to receive more information, thus enabling the students to learn about the process at their own speed.

Reference-contexts: Applications for Bayesian Networks include medical diagnosis, traffic scene analysis [7], map learning, and computer vision/perceptual grouping problems [8]. Char-niak <ref> [2] </ref> says that "It is probably fair to say that Bayesian networks are to a large segment of the AI-uncertainty community what resolution theorem proving is to the AI-logic community." This comment leads us to another why: why aren't more people (especially students) using Bayesian Networks if they are so useful <p> Cyclic networks are not permitted. Building a network involves adding (or deleting) nodes, adding (or deleting) links between nodes, and editing nodes to specify their probabilities. Figure 1 shows a singly connected network example from <ref> [2] </ref> in the editing stage. The left portion of the window shows graphically the network that is being built, and the right portion is the editing window that allows the probabilities for the current node (in this case, dog-out) to be entered. <p> Associated with root nodes (no parent) is a prior probability node button, and associated with the other nodes are conditional probability node buttons, all of which yield the appropriate information and allow for changes when pressed. Figure 2 shows a singly-connected network that was taken from <ref> [2] </ref> as it appears in the BayNEx Explorer (70% belief was associated with the family-out node). We believe that the graphical representation of the system and information is crucial to the understanding of Bayesian Networks.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we decided upon a modal interface for the bulk of the tool, as several other UNIX-based packages (such as xfig, xpaint, and vi) employ the same principle. To build our interface, we used the SUIT <ref> [3] </ref> [4] package. 3 BayNEx FACILITIES As was mentioned previously, BayNEx is divided into three main sections: the Explorer, the Network Builder, and the Knowledge Tester.

Reference-contexts: Here, those questions would be: who uses Bayesian Networks and why are they used? Bayesian Networks are typically used by Artificial Intelligence researchers who have an excellent background in and understanding of reasoning and probability theory. Applications for Bayesian Networks include medical diagnosis, traffic scene analysis <ref> [7] </ref>, map learning, and computer vision/perceptual grouping problems [8].
