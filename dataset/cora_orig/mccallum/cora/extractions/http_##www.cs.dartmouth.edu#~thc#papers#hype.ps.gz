Reference-contexts: Sorting networks of depth O (lg n) are known <ref> [1] </ref>, but they are impractical to use as hyperconcentrator switches because of the large associated constant.

Reference-contexts: One multichip partial concentrator switch construction <ref> [2, 3] </ref> is based on the Revsort two-dimensional mesh sorting algorithm of Schnorr and Shamir [15] and uses 3 p n hyperconcentrator chips with with p n inputs each. This construction yields an (n; m; 1 O (n 3=4 =m)) partial concentrator switch in three-dimensional volume fi (n 3=2 ). <p> If the switch is to be packaged by itself on a chip, it may require more input and output pins than are provided by the packaging technology. A different n-by-n hyperconcentrator switch design, consisting of a parallel prefix circuit and a butterfly network <ref> [2] </ref>, can be built in volume fi (n 3=2 ) 24 with O (n lg n) chips and as few as four data pins per chip, but this switch is not combinational.

A signal incurs 3 lg n + O (1) gate delays in passing through this switch. Another such construction <ref> [3] </ref>, based on Leighton's Columnsort algorithm [9], uses fi (n 1fi ) hyperconcentrator chips with fi (n fi ) inputs each, for any 1=2 fi 1. This construction produces an (n; m; 1 O (n 22fi )) partial concentrator switch in volume fi (n 1+fi ). <p> Although its sequential control is not very complex, it is not as simple as that of a combinational circuit. We can build multichip hyperconcentrator switches by extending either of the above multichip partial concentrator switch designs <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The chip, shown in Figure 1, contains programmable selector circuitry preceding the hyperconcentrator switch so that an independent routing decision can be made for each input, as in Figures 6 and 7. Each of the 16 selectors includes a UV write-enabled PROM cell, described by Glasser <ref> [4] </ref>. The bit value stored in each PROM cell is compared with an address bit in the input message to determine whether the message is going in the correct direction.

Reference-contexts: To avoid this phenomenon of premature discharging, domino CMOS circuits are 14 designed with all precharged gate inputs monotonically increasing|having no 1-to-0 transitions|during the evaluate phase. (Readers desiring more information about domino CMOS design are referred to <ref> [5] </ref> and [18].) The circuit resulting from the straightforward modification of the ratioed nMOS design to domino CMOS|adding n-channel evaluate transistors to each pulldown circuit and replacing the depletion mode pullups by p-channel precharge transistors|is not a well-behaved domino CMOS circuit during setup.

Reference-contexts: A hyperconcentrator switch can be implemented using a sorting network, as described by Knuth <ref> [8, pp. 220-246] </ref>. The inputs to the sorting network are 1's and 0's, representing the presence or absence of messages on the input wires to the switch. The sorting of the 1's and 0's, with 1's before 0's, causes the k input messages to occupy the first k outputs. <p> The sorting of the 1's and 0's, with 1's before 0's, causes the k input messages to occupy the first k outputs. Many sorting networks, such as Batcher's bitonic sort <ref> [8, pp. 232-233] </ref>, employ the technique of recursive merging. A problem of size n is divided into two problems of size n=2, which are recursively solved in parallel. The two sorted sets are then merged to produce the solution to the original problem.

Reference-contexts: A signal therefore incurs exactly 2 dlg ne gate delays in passing through the switch. The switch has a simple design and a regular layout in both ratioed nMOS and domino CMOS technologies. Unlike many concentrator switches in the literature <ref> [12, 13, 14] </ref>, our switch sets itself up "on-line" when messages are presented to it. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the merge box, the basic building block of our switch.

Reference-contexts: The switch design in this paper is compatible with any of these congestion control methods. 4 One way to create a concentrator switch is with a hyperconcentrator switch. An n-by-n hyperconcentrator switch (the terminology is drawn from Valiant <ref> [17] </ref>) has n input wires X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X n and n output wires Y 1 ; Y 2 ; : : : ; Y n . <p> Superconcentrator switches are useful in fault-tolerant systems. If some of the output wires of a concentrator switch may be faulty, we can use a superconcentrator switch that routes signals to only the good output wires. Following the construction by Valiant <ref> [17] </ref>, we can build a superconcen-trator switch out of two full-duplex hyperconcentrator switches H F and H R , as shown in Figure 8. (After setup in a full-duplex hyperconcentrator switch, signals can travel along the established paths simultaneously in both forward and reverse directions.
