Title: QUADRALINEAR TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS

Abstract: In time-frequency analysis there are four bilinear domains commonly used: time-frequency, ambiguity, temporal autocorrelation, and spectral auto-correlation. This paper introduces four new domains that are quadralinear in the signal. These four domains are each a function of three of the four variables used in the bilinear domains. Properties of these quantities are developed and an application is given for the design of adaptive time-varying kernels.

Reference-contexts: Each function has properties that make it more useful for a particular application. For example, the WD is useful for representing the time-frequency content of the signal, while the AF is useful for designing kernels that eliminate crossterms <ref> [1] </ref>. This paper introduces four quadralinear domains that are functions of three of the four variables mentioned above. The quadralinear functions are derived from the bilinear functions in the same way that the bilinear functions are derived from the linear functions.

Reference-contexts: The quadralinear functions are described below with an application to adaptive time-varying kernel design. An octalinear function is also introduced that is a function of all four variables. The functions defined here bear resemblance to the Wigner higher order moment spectra defined by Fonollosa and Nikias <ref> [2] </ref>, the polynomial Wigner distribution defined by Boashash and O'Shea [3], and the L-Wigner distribution defined by Stankovic [4].

An application would be in the design of time and frequency varying kernels. 6. CONCLUSION Higher order representations previously defined <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref> are functions of one or more time and frequency variables. This paper introduces quadralinear representations that are functions of three different variables, at least one of which is lag or Doppler.

Reference-contexts: In other words the example signal is locally "like" an increasing linear chirp. In between these two times, the TLDF gradually progresses as expected. 4. TIME-VARYING KERNEL DESIGN An application of the TLDF and FLDF is the design of time-varying kernels and frequency-varying kernels respectively. Baraniuk and Jones <ref> [5, 6] </ref> have designed algorithms that derive adaptive time-invariant kernels based on the AF. They then extended this to derive time-varying kernels by using a short-time ambiguity function (STAF) [7].

They then extended this to derive time-varying kernels by using a short-time ambiguity function (STAF) <ref> [7] </ref>. A slightly different time-varying kernel can be constructed by replacing the STAF with a TLDF and using the same adaptive algorithm. The relationship between the TLDF and the STAF is similar to that between the Wigner distribution and the spectrogram.
