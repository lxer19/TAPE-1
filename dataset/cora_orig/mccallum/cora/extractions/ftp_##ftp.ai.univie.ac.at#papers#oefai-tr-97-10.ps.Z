Reference-contexts: 1984), * the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) project (Brecher, Wilkenfeld, & Moser, 1988; Wilkenfeld, Brecher, & Moser, 1988), * the COPDAB dataset (Azar, 1980), * the event data sets of the KEDS and PANDA projects (Schrodt & Davis, 1994; Vogele, 1994; Bond, Bennet, & Voegele, 1994), * the Butterworth dataset <ref> (Butterworth, 1976) </ref>, * the SHERFACS database (Sherman, 1988), * the KOSIMO database of conflicts (Pfetsch & Billing, 1994), * the CONFMAN database of conflict management attempts (Bercovitch & Langley, 1993). We believe that databases like the above-mentioned provide a promising application area for symbolic machine learning algorithms. <p> The database is an attempt to unify and extend case lists and databases of several previous research projects: primarily <ref> (Butterworth, 1976) </ref>,(Brecher et al., 1988),(Wilkenfeld et al., 1988), but also (Gantzel & Meyer-Stamer, 1986), (Holsti, 1983), and others. It contains more than 1400 conflicts from 1482 to 1990 encoded in three tables. <p> More extensive overviews can be found in (Mallery, 1988), (Schrodt, 1991a), and (Schrodt, 1997). Schrodt (1991b) has performed several experiments in predicting interstate conflict outcomes using the Butterworth "Interstate Security Conflicts, 1945-1974" <ref> (Butterworth, 1976) </ref>. He used his own implementation of ID3, the predecessor of C4.5, to learn decision trees for predicting the effects of management efforts with respect to five different outcomes.

Reference-contexts: As the database was not generated with the explicit aim of empirical analysis, its complex structure (list-valued, hierarchical, textual, and multi-dimensional fields) made several transformation necessary, which are described in more detail in <ref> (Furnkranz, Petrak, & Trappl, 1997) </ref>. <p> failed in 7 mediation attempts. 1 The value range of the -c parameter in C4.5 is from 0 to 100, where a low value indicates heavy pruning, while a value of 100 indicates no pruning. 6 attempts 7 A complete decision tree resulting from these experiments can be found in <ref> (Furnkranz et al., 1997) </ref>. In another experiment we tried to compare the results of feature subset selection with the identification of relevant factors by statistical analysis. <p> We have also tried several enhancements of the basic nearest neighbor algorithm, like e.g. case weighting or considering more than one neighbor for the derivation of a classification. These and more experiments with different weighting schemes and on a different subset of the KOSIMO database can be found in <ref> (Furnkranz et al., 1997) </ref> and (Petrak, Trappl, & Furnkranz, 1994). 5 Related Work and Discussion There has been some previous work on rule induction via decision tree learning, which we will briefly discuss below. More extensive overviews can be found in (Mallery, 1988), (Schrodt, 1991a), and (Schrodt, 1997).

Mallery and Sherman (1993) report a variety of rules that have been learned with I 2 D <ref> (Unseld & Mallery, 1993) </ref>, an improved version of ID3 that was specifically developed to deal with the structured nature of the SHERFACS dataset (Sherman, 1988). They report purity and coverage for the learned rules, but give no indication of their predictive accuracies.
