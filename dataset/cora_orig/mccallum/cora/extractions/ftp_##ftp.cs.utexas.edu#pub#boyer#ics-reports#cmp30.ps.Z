Reference-contexts: Normally, many of the verification conditions are proved automatically in the verification condition generator by the algebraic simplifier. Those formulas that do not simplify to TRUE must be proved with the theorem prover. The theorem prover is an interactive, natural deduction prover that has been adapted from <ref> [Bledsoe 74] </ref>. The prover is really more like a proof checker than a proof constructor. It provides a list of sound deductive manipulations that a user can apply interactively to the current subgoal.
