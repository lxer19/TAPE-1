Abstract: The problem of finding the internal orientation of a camera (camera calibration) is extremely important for practical applications. In this paper a complete method for calibrating a camera is presented. In contrast with existing methods it does not require a calibration object with a known 3D shape. The new method requires only point matches from image sequences. It is shown, using experiments with noisy data, that it is possible to calibrate a camera just by pointing it at the environment, selecting points of interest and then tracking them in the image as the camera moves. It is not necessary to know the camera motion. The camera calibration is computed in two steps. In the first step the epipolar transformation is found. Two methods for obtaining the epipoles are discussed, one due to Sturm is based on projective invariants, the other is based on a generalisation of the essential matrix. The second step of the computation uses the so-called Kruppa equations which link the epipolar transformation to the image of the absolute conic. After the camera has made three or more movements the Kruppa equations can be solved for the coefficients of the image of the absolute conic. The solution is found using a continuation method which is briefly described. The intrinsic parameters of the camera are obtained from the equation for the image of the absolute conic. The results of experiments with synthetic noisy data are reported and possible enhancements to the method are suggested.

Reference-contexts: This gives five intrinsic parameters. This is exactly the number of independent coefficients for the image w of the absolute conic thus the intrinsic parameters can be obtained from w. The equation of w is <ref> [3] </ref>: y T A 1T A 1 y = 0 It follows that D = AA T .

Reference-contexts: The matrix A depends on a variable number of parameters, according to the sophistication of the camera model. These are the intrinsic parameters. There are five of them in the model used here. It is the intrinsic parameters that are to be computed. In the usual method of calibration <ref> [4] </ref> [12] a special object is put in the field of view of the camera. The 3D shape of the calibration object is known, in other words the 3D coordinates of some reference points on it are known in a coordinate system attached to the object.

Reference-contexts: This is enough to determine the camera calibration uniquely. 3 Computing the Epipoles Two different methods for computing the epipoles are described. 3.1 Sturm's Method The epipoles and the epipolar transformations can be computed by a method due to Hesse <ref> [6] </ref> and nicely summarized by Sturm in [10]. Sturm's method yields the epipoles compatible with seven image correspondences. Let q i $ q i , 1 i n, be a set of image correspondences.

Reference-contexts: It follows that F = A 1T EA 1 , where E is an essential matrix. Unlike the essential matrix, which is characterized by the two constraints found by Huang and Faugeras <ref> [7] </ref> which are the nullity of the determinant and the equality of the two non-zero singular values, the only property of the fundamental matrix is that it is of rank two.

Reference-contexts: Another difficulty is that the position of the minimum is quite sensitive to noise, as will be seen in the experimental section below. 3.2 The Fundamental Matrix Method The fundamental matrix F is a generalization of the essential matrix described in <ref> [8] </ref>. For a given point m in the first image, the corresponding epipolar line e m in the second image is linearly related to the projective representation of m. The 3 fi 3 matrix F describes this correspondence. <p> It is then an essential matrix and (13) is the so-called Longuet-Higgins equation in motion analysis <ref> [8] </ref>. If the image is formed by a general projection, as described in (1), then F is of rank two. The matrix A of intrinsic parameters (1) transforms the image to the image that would have been obtained by projection onto the unit sphere.

Reference-contexts: Matching is then done by correlation techniques or by a tracking method such as the one described in [2]. 2 Kruppa's Equations and Self-Calibration A brief introduction is given to the theory underlying the calibration method. A longer and more detailed account is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.1 Derivation of Kruppa's Equations Kruppa's equations link the epipolar transformation to the image w of the absolute conic . The conic w determines the camera calibration, thus the equations provide a way of deducing the camera calibration from the epipolar transformations associated with a sequence of camera motions. <p> The conic w = M () thus depends only on the matrix A of intrinsic parameters. The converse is also true <ref> [9] </ref> in that w determines the intrinsic parameters. Let the camera undergo a finite displacement and let k be the line joining the optical centre of the camera prior to the motion to the optical centre of the camera after the motion. <p> The properties of c are obtained in <ref> [9] </ref>. It is shown that c can be represented as an algebraic curve of degree seven in P 3 or alternatively as an algebraic curve of degree six in P . <p> The point x 1 fi x 2 lies on a curve g which is an algebraic transformation of c. It is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that g is of degree six and genus four. The point p 1 fi p 0 1 of g corresponding to the line hp 1 ; p 0 1 i in the image plane is a singular point of multiplicity three. <p> The curve g has three additional singular points, each of order two. An algorithm for obtaining these three singular points is described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The algorithm produces a cubic polynomial equation in one variable, the roots of which yield the three singular points. Three camera displacements yield six conditions on the camera calibration. <p> However, it yields more precise results and allows the direct use of the formulas (15) to obtain the epipolar transformation. 4 Solving Kruppa's Equations: the Continuation Method Symbolic methods for solving Kruppa's equations are described in <ref> [9] </ref>. These methods are very sensitive to noise: even ordinary machine precision is not sufficient. Also they require rational numbers rather than real numbers. In this section Kruppa's equations are solved by an alternative method which is suitable for real world use.

Reference-contexts: However, even when the camera performs a task, the intrinsic parameters can change intentionally (for example adjustment of the focal length), or not (for example mechanical or thermal variations). The problem of calibrating the extrinsic parameters on-line has already been addressed <ref> [11] </ref>. The goal of this paper is to present a calibration method that can be carried out using the same images required for performing the visual task. The method applies when the camera undergoes a series of displacements in a rigid scene.

Reference-contexts: Recently developed methods in numerical continuation can reliably compute all solutions to polynomial systems. These methods have been improved over a decade to provide reliable solutions to kinematics problems. The details of these improvements are omitted. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [13] </ref> for a tutorial presentation. The solution of a system of nonlinear equations by numerical continuation is suggested by the idea that small changes in the parameters of the system usually produce small changes in the solutions.
