Abstract: An algorithm for rapid computation of Richards's smooth molecular surface is described. The entire surface is computed analytically, triangulated, and displayed at interactive rates. The faster speeds for our program have been achieved by algorithmic improvements, parallelizing the computations, and by taking advantage of the special geometrical properties of such surfaces. Our algorithm is easily parallelizable and it has a time complexity of O(k log k) over n processors, where n is the number of atoms of the molecule and k is the average number of neighbors per atom.

Reference-contexts: Define the feasible cell, F i , for atom i as F i = " j H ij . So far, the definitions that we have given for a feasible cell correspond exactly to the power cells of a power diagram as defined by Aurenhammer <ref> [1] </ref>. The reason we prefer to use a different term for these will be made clear in Section 3.3. 3.2 Determination of Neighboring Atoms Determination of neighboring atoms can be done by spatial grid subdivision into voxels, and assigning atoms to appropriate voxels. <p> This checking for nullity is done by Seidel's randomized linear programming algorithm that has linear time and is quite fast in practice [17]. It might be useful to point out how the feasible cells F i we are computing are different from the power cells described by Aurenhammer <ref> [1] </ref>. The difference arises from the fact that each of these cells F i are being computed independently of the other, and for each cell F i we consider only the hyperplanes whose indices occur in N i .

Reference-contexts: An ff-shape of a set of points P is a subset of the Delaunay triangulation of P . Edelsbrunner in <ref> [7] </ref>, extends the concept of ff-shapes to deal with weighted points (i.e. spheres with possibly unequal and non-zero radii) in three-dimensions. An ff-shape of a set of weighted points P w is a subset of the regular triangulation of P w . <p> The method given by Edelsbrunner <ref> [7] </ref> finds these edges by first computing the entire three-dimensional regular triangulation, an O (n 2 ) approach.

It has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that it is possible to compute the ff-hulls from the Voronoi diagram of the points of P . For ff = 1 the ff-hull over the set of points P is the same as their convex hull.

Here an ff-shape over a set of points P has been defined to be the polytope that approximates the ff-hull over P , by replacing circular arcs of the ff-hull by straight edges and spherical caps by triangles.

Reference-contexts: We show here an equivalent method for computing the three-dimensional ff-hulls for molecules in parallel time O (k log k) over n processors To compute F i , we compute the convex hull of the points dual to the H ij in the dual-space, as described in <ref> [15] </ref>. This is an O (k log k) time process. After this, we compute the dual of the convex hull to get the feasible cell F i . The intersection of the feasible cell F i with i gives rise to a set of closed components on i .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The smooth molecular surface of a molecule is defined as the surface which an exterior probe-sphere touches as it is rolled over the spherical atoms of that molecule. This definition of a molecular surface was first proposed by Richards <ref> [16] </ref>. This surface is useful in studying the structure and interactions of proteins, in particular for attacking the protein-substrate docking problem. An example of such a molecular surface for Felix with a probe-sphere radius of 1:4 A can be seen in Figure 1. <p> It has been shown in [8] that it is possible to compute the ff-hulls from the Voronoi diagram of the points of P . For ff = 1 the ff-hull over the set of points P is the same as their convex hull. Richards <ref> [16] </ref> had also suggested computing the molecular surface by computing a 3D Voronoi diagram first and then using its faces to determine which nearby atoms to consider. Edelsbrunner and Mucke [9] extend the definition of ff-hulls to points in three-dimensions.

Reference-contexts: If F i = , atom i is totally buried and cannot be a surface atom. This checking for nullity is done by Seidel's randomized linear programming algorithm that has linear time and is quite fast in practice <ref> [17] </ref>. It might be useful to point out how the feasible cells F i we are computing are different from the power cells described by Aurenhammer [1].
