Abstract: Interactive fiction presents new requirements for natural language generation. In particular, changing the style of output text should be as easy as turning a knob or flipping a switch. GLINDA, the natural language generation module of the Oz interactive fiction system, is an implemented natural language text generation system which uses the propagation of features during generation to license generation rules. These rules control the selection, organization, transformation and combination of elements from the input semantic and pragmatic representation within a uniform, multi-level linguistic framework. Several examples of English tense and aspect structure illustrate the benefits of this approach. GLINDA is fast and elegant, and generates text in an incremental, indelible, left-to-right fashion.

Reference-contexts: is set to high. 10 The Government-Binding Theory definition of subjacency is: Y is said to be subjacent to X if and only if X is superior to Y and there is at most one bounding node C Y such that C contains Y and C does not contain X <ref> [Chomsky 1981; Ambrose-Grillet 1978] </ref>. Insofar as GLINDA groups correspond in an informal sense to the bounding nodes (e.g., S and NP nodes) of Government-Binding Theory, groups X and Y are subjacent if and only if X and Y are siblings.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction GLINDA is the natural language generation module of the Oz interactive fiction system developed at the CMU School of Computer Science <ref> [Bates 1989] </ref>. Oz is intended to simulate dramatically interesting microworlds, as a form of interactive fiction. The major goals of language generation in Oz are to produce a variety of views of the reality that Oz simulates and to produce vivid dialogue for computer modelled agents.

Reference-contexts: NOT-PAST is equivalent to Brent's modified definition of the simultaneity operator <ref> [Brent 1990] </ref>. In particular, we are able to generate legal combinations of temporally coordinated clauses simply by having relation-groups return only the R-TIME feature. <p> An INFLECTION feature is a subtype of SUFFIX, so it is realized as "ed" for value PAST-PART, combining with the root. Of course, irregular verbs can shadow these rules, as does the rule for GO in Section 3.3 above.

We felt that we might be able to generalize these primitives and benefit from the uniformity. <p> The organization rules have been used to represent a variety of levels of linguistic phenomena, including syntax, lexical selection, and morphology. Since the selection, organization and combination operations are generalizations of the inclusion, ordering and casting operations of Ed Hovy's PAULINE text planning system <ref> [Hovy 1988] </ref>, GLINDA should be able to do text planning.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this the system must be able to "tune" the natural language generation to engender subtle emotional reactions in and influences on the human player <ref> [Smith & Bates 1989; Laurel 1986] </ref>. At the level of realization this means providing an interface of "knobs" for controlling the style of natural language output. GLINDA provides such an interface by means of a set of user-specified generation rules which define the knobs and their effects.

Reference-contexts: This rule says that the word-group for nouns, for example, is realized as the string "he" if it is in the pronominal form, nominative case, and 3rd person singular masculine. 9 This internal representation is similar to the choice experts in Penman <ref> [Mann 1982] </ref> and systemic grammars, except that the choice experts in GLINDA are constraints, not arbitrary LISP code. Moreover, some choices of the systemic grammar are actually encoded in the projector ontology.

Reference-contexts: There are also specific rules governing the transformation or mapping of features at each recursive call of the generator. GLINDA is similar in many ways to MUMBLE <ref> [McDonald 1980, 1983, 1985] </ref>. Both systems are description-directed, in that the input and not the grammar drives the generation process. Both produce output in an indelible manner; once a rule has been invoked, it cannot be retracted.

Reference-contexts: Extended Examples In this section we discuss one way GLINDA has handled English tense and aspect structure, including the examples from Figure 2-2 and the temporally coordinated clauses from Figure 4-1 below. We use Hans Reichenbach's three-point semantics for English tenses <ref> [Reichenbach 1947] </ref>, with slight modifications. Reichenbachian SRE timelines describe the underlying structure of tenses with respect to three moments or points in time: The point of Speech (S) The point of Reference (R) The point of Event (E) The interpretation of S and E is self-evident. <p> Of course, irregular verbs can shadow these rules, as does the rule for GO in Section 3.3 above. For a further discussion of tense and aspect systems, see [Brent 1990], [Comrie 1985], [Dahl 1985], <ref> [Reichenbach 1947] </ref>, and the June 1988 Special Issue on Tense and Aspect of Computational Linguistics. 5. The Text Generation Evaluator As in the text-generation evaluator model [McDonald 1983], the generation process in GLINDA is driven by the message to be expressed and not by the hierarchical structure of the grammar.

The Semantic and Pragmatic Representation The semantic and pragmatic representation we use emphasizes the functional properties of the input in a manner similar to LFG [Kaplan & Bresnan 1982] and PATR-II <ref> [Shieber 1983] </ref>. We define the semantic and pragmatic representation and present a simple example to illustrate its use. 2.1. The Definition of "Groups" The basic data structure in GLINDA is called a group. A group is a typed set of items acting as a 2 single entity. <p> in the linguistic hierarchy (morphology, 1 This difference is not of immediate concern, as GLINDA could easily be modified to operate like MUMBLE if there were a reason to do so. 2 Like f-structures [Bresnan 1982; Nyberg 1988; Tomita 1988], feature bundles [Gazdar 1985], functional structures [Kay 1983], and dags <ref> [Shieber 1983] </ref>, the arguments of a relation are included in the group.

The major difference is that features are realizable elements which are percolated throughout the system, and are not tied to the categories (there aren't any categories in GLINDA, per se), but are contained within the groups.
