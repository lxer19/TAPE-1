Title: Data Management Tools for Scientific Applications An Overview

Abstract: In this overview we briefly describe a collection of tools that aid scientists in specifying database structures and in querying databases using object-oriented concepts on top of commercial relational database management systems. These tools allow scientists to deal with application-specific structures and operations rather than relational database definitions and queries; such definitions and queries are usually large, hard to maintain, and involve terms that obscure the semantics of the application. Using these tools scientists are insulated from the underlying database management system, and thus can avoid learning database management specific concepts and query languages.

Reference-contexts: Once an EER schema is specified, SDT is used in order to generate the corresponding DBMS schema definition, including procedures for maintaining referential integrity constraints. EER schema diagram defined by a database designer for a genomic application <ref> [7] </ref>. ERDRAW allows the diagrammatic specification of entity-sets, which are used to model the main objects in the application (graphically represented by rectangular vertices), and associations of entity-sets, called relationship-sets (represented graphically by diamond vertices).
