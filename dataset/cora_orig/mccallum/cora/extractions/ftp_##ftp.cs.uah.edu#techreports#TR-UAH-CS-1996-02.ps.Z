Abstract: One of the more valuable and flexible forms of knowledge acquisition is based upon the use of repertory grids. A useful extension of repertory grids can be created by providing a method of semantically linking associated constructs and repertory grids. This network of grids is a semantic network with nodes consisting of individual repertory grids and links acting as `tracks.' A track is a generalization of the laddering process used by repertory grid systems. These linked repertory grids which are acquired using the natural language interface of repertory grids can form an operational definition of a problem solving method.

Reference-contexts: Meta-level systems are useful for generalizing the capabilities of a given non meta-level system. PROTEGE-II [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994], TERESIAS <ref> [Barr and Feigenbaum 1986] </ref>, ASK [Gruber 1989], and SOAR [Rich and Knight 1991] are all meta-level systems (PROTEGE-II, TERESIAS, and ASK are KA systems although SOAR is not) which improve their performance, their ability to solve general problems more efficiently, through the advent of higher-level knowledge about their own internal problem <p> Strategic knowledge is knowledge about what should be done next. This meta level operational data is used to allow the direct acquisition of the control structure for the reasoning system. TEREISIAS works with meta-level descriptions of rules <ref> [Barr and Feigenbaum 1986] </ref>. This allows TEREISISAS to help the knowledge source test the current rule set. In essence, the knowledge source is helping to debug the current knowledge structures.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge acquisition as it became known within computer science was practiced earlier on a manual basis and later on an automated basis. Manual knowledge acquisition came in several flavors with protocol analysis, interviews, and observation being common acquisition activities <ref> [Belkin, Brooks, and Daniels 1987] </ref>. Protocol analysis involves inspecting verbal records of experts describing their own thought processes as they solve a typical problem. Interviews are a process where a knowledge engineer either informally or formally debriefs an expert.

Reference-contexts: A more generally applicable KA capability can be created by extending repertory grids. This extension is achieved by generalizing the laddering process used in AQUINAS <ref> [Boose and Bradshaw 1987] </ref>. Laddering applies a question to an existing construct to elicit a new construct. Laddering is used to acquire either a more generalized construct or a more specialized construct, depending on the question. <p> Different triads are used to elicit the rest of the constructs. This method helps fill in a solitary grid but does nothing to help with the process of filling in multiple grids. The more powerful forms of repertory grid systems such as AQUINAS <ref> [Boose and Bradshaw 1987] </ref> and KSSn [Gaines 1993] provide sophisticated ways to manipulate the acquired knowledge. AQUINAS provides a number of ways to fill in individual grid values and to fill in grids. An appropriate type of grid value can be selected: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. <p> Just as it was not convenient in AQUINAS to only allow bi-polar constructs <ref> [Boose and Bradshaw 1987] </ref>, it is not convenient in this proposed system to assume that well-formed grids have multiple elements or that every pole must apply to an element.

Reference-contexts: Repertory grids are also strongly tied to the heuristic classification problem solving method which is most useful in the solution of analytic problems. It is possible to cast a synthetic problem in terms of heuristic classification <ref> [Gaines 1994, Bradshaw, Boose, Covington, and Russo 1987] </ref> but the problem must be restated to fit the heuristic classification terminology. Meta-level systems are useful for generalizing the capabilities of a given non meta-level system. <p> It is not necessary to recast the problem description into the form of heuristic classification. The meta-level grids that describe the problem will be shown first. Subsequently, the non-meta level grids will be shown. 4.1 Meta-level The meta-level description of a synthetic problem is shown in Figure 15 <ref> [Bradshaw, Boose, Covington, and Russo 1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is no previously existing acquisition strategy available. In a more realistic setting, the system would have a library of pre-defined methodologies and a procedure similar to that used by PROTEGE-II [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994] , DDUCKS [Bradshaw and Boose 1993] or FAD <ref> [Bradshaw, Covington, Russo, and Boose 1989] </ref> for selecting an appropriate strategy can be used. The task of the meta-KE would be to capture the knowledge about synthetic problems contained in this figure.

Reference-contexts: There are two KA techniques that are suitable candidates for use as a basis for a more generally applicable KA capability. These two KA techniques are the repertory grid technique [Kelly 1955] and the meta-technique of PROTEGE-II <ref> [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994] </ref>. The repertory grid technique is suitable because of its bias towards natural language, its domain independence, and its built-in methodology for filling in a single repertory grid. <p> It is possible to cast a synthetic problem in terms of heuristic classification [Gaines 1994, Bradshaw, Boose, Covington, and Russo 1987] but the problem must be restated to fit the heuristic classification terminology.

PROTEGE allowed the ability to generate OPAL-like systems useful for performing knowledge acquisition for episodic skeletal-plan refinement (a problem-solving method useful for cancer therapy). PROTEGE-II which is a later version of PROTEGE has an even greater level of generality <ref> [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994] </ref>. Problem solving methods other than episodic skeletal-plan refinement are supported. Generality is not the only advantage of a meta-level system. Meta reasoning can also improve the efficiency of reasoning and knowledge acquisition. <p> There is no previously existing acquisition strategy available. In a more realistic setting, the system would have a library of pre-defined methodologies and a procedure similar to that used by PROTEGE-II <ref> [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994] </ref> , DDUCKS [Bradshaw and Boose 1993] or FAD [Bradshaw, Covington, Russo, and Boose 1989] for selecting an appropriate strategy can be used.

Reference-contexts: All of these processes are labor intensive and error-prone. Automated knowledge acquistion offers a significant amount of relief to these problems. 2.2 Previous Automated Approaches The previous automated approaches to knowledge acquisition were of two types <ref> [Gruber 1988] </ref>. One type was based around machine learning where the knowledge acquisition consisted of a set of examples being provided to a program which is capable of generalizing these examples to extract pertinent knowledge about the phenomenon in question.

Reference-contexts: Meta-level systems are useful for generalizing the capabilities of a given non meta-level system. PROTEGE-II [Eriksson, Shahar, Tu, Puerta, and Musen 1994], TERESIAS [Barr and Feigenbaum 1986], ASK <ref> [Gruber 1989] </ref>, and SOAR [Rich and Knight 1991] are all meta-level systems (PROTEGE-II, TERESIAS, and ASK are KA systems although SOAR is not) which improve their performance, their ability to solve general problems more efficiently, through the advent of higher-level knowledge about their own internal problem solving behaviors. <p> By reasoning about which rules are likely to be useful, the efficiency of the system is improved. This type of efficiency improvement could make an unsuccessful system become successful. ASK is a meta level system which concentrates on strategic knowledge <ref> [Gruber 1989] </ref>. Strategic knowledge is knowledge about what should be done next. This meta level operational data is used to allow the direct acquisition of the control structure for the reasoning system. TEREISIAS works with meta-level descriptions of rules [Barr and Feigenbaum 1986].

Reference-contexts: The knowledge representation used is often tailored to be useful for one specific type of problem and one problem solving method. MOLE, SALT, KNACK, TKAW, and OPAL are all systems which intimately associate knowledge with the role that knowledge plays <ref> [Kornell 1988] </ref>. This is a patently effective way to construct a knowledge based system that will serve a specific purpose. Considered as a whole, the knowledge based system performs a certain role just as each atomic piece of knowledge is assumed to serve a particular (albeit limited) role.

Reference-contexts: Such types of systems tend to work better in relatively well-understood areas like planning than in difficult areas like natural language understanding <ref> [Rich and Knight 1991] </ref>. Neural network learning is one type of such knowledge acquisition. The knowledge acquired by a neural network is not symbolic in nature and is not useful as a basis for further inferencing. <p> Meta-level systems are useful for generalizing the capabilities of a given non meta-level system.

Generality is not the only advantage of a meta-level system. Meta reasoning can also improve the efficiency of reasoning and knowledge acquisition. SOAR is a rule-based system which emulates human problem solving <ref> [Rich and Knight 1991] </ref>. By reasoning about which rules are likely to be useful, the efficiency of the system is improved. This type of efficiency improvement could make an unsuccessful system become successful. ASK is a meta level system which concentrates on strategic knowledge [Gruber 1989].

Reference-contexts: An appropriate type of grid value can be selected: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. A grid value can also be selected from a probability distribution. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to aid the process of assigning values <ref> [Saaty 1980] </ref>. Laddering can be used to determine higher and lower level traits. An associated grid at one level can be used to fill in a grid at another level. Clustering can be used to derive higher level grids. Implication analysis can be used to search for redundancy.

Reference-contexts: A conceptual graph is a form of a semantic network which has a semantics based on predicate logic, an ability to organize information in a standardized and therefore comparable format, and relatively few built-in, unavoidable restrictions on its ability to represent knowledge <ref> [Sowa 1984] </ref>.
