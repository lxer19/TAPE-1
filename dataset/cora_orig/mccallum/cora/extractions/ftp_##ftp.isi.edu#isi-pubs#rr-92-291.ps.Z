Abstract: ATOMIC is an inexpensive O(gigabit) speed LAN built by USC/ISI. It is based upon Mosaic technology developed for fine-grain, message-passing, massively parallel computation. Each Mosaic processor is capable of routing variable length packets, while providing added value through simultaneous computing and buffering. ATOMIC adds a general routing capability to the native Mosaic wormhole routing through store-and-forward. ATOMIC scales linearly, with a small interface cost. Each ATOMIC channel has a data carrying capacity of 500Mb/s. A prototype ATOMIC LAN has been constructed along with host interfaces and software that provides full TCP/IP compatibility. Using ATOMIC, 1,500 byte packets have been exchanged between hosts at an aggregate transfer rate of more than 1Gb/s. Other tests have demonstrated throughput of 5.25 million packets per second over a single channel. This paper describes the architecture and performance of ATOMIC. ATOMIC is an O(gigabit) speed, low cost, switch-based LAN built by USC/ISI. It relies on the repetitive application of Caltechs Mosaic chip (see Section 3.1), that serves as a fast and smart switching element. It is capable of routing variable length IP packets while providing added value through simultaneous computing and buffering. ATOMIC scales easily by adding point to point channels and has a low interface cost. At present, a prototype of ATOMIC is operational including an IP interface for the BSD UNIX 2 environment. The developmental Host Interface (HI) boards use four memoryless Mosaic chips to create four network interfaces. Each interface uses 25MHz SRAM memory chips that are accessible to the host Sun-3 workstation via the VME bus. The use of 25Mhz, rather than 32Mhz, mem 1.

Reference-contexts: Hence, no breakthroughs (or even small miracles) are needed to improve performance five to ten times. These improvements apply to the ATOMIC network only, not host/UNIX overhead. To deliver gigabit rates to a workstation application requires major changes in the handling of network communication <ref> [5] </ref>. 8.2 Better Interface Design The ratio in performance of the ATOMIC prototype to the Ethernet is approximately 100:1. Until now most network interfaces were designed on the assumption that the network was much slower than the core communications resources within the workstation, its bus and memory. <p> The device driver software copies the packets, placing them onto kernel queues where they await distribution to consuming processes. The consumers may copy the packets again when retrieving them from kernel queues. Network output reverses that procedure <ref> [5] </ref>. For a workstation to achieve the performance that a gigabit LAN can deliver requires a new network interface design. The kernelinterface copying may be eliminated by allowing the inter ATOMIC: A Low-Cost, Very-High-Speed LAN 17 of 22 face to share access to the kernel network queues.

Reference-contexts: It has also been suggested that ATM could be used for this, although switching would be external [18][6]. Some of the details of the Autonet project [26] at DEC Systems Research Center is similar to ATOMIC <ref> [7] </ref>. The Autonet LAN is also a switch-based network, and it uses point-to-point links of 100Mb/s over coaxial cable. One difference between the two projects lies in packet addressing. Autonet uses a scheme described as somewhere between source routing and routing by unique identifier.

Reference-contexts: As a packet passes through Mosaic nodes, its leading prefix is decremented until it reaches zero. X-direction routing, if any, occurs before all Y-direction routing. This restriction avoids deadlock <ref> [10] </ref>. The Mosaic chip is the building block for both the HI boards and the switches.

Reference-contexts: The kernelinterface copying may be eliminated by allowing the inter ATOMIC: A Low-Cost, Very-High-Speed LAN 17 of 22 face to share access to the kernel network queues. Packets may then be stored directly into those queues on input and retrieved from the queues on output <ref> [11] </ref>. This requires that the interface be sufficiently exible that it can manipulate kernel data structures. The Mosaic CPU in ATOMIC provides such exibility. The modifications that would allow elimination of kernelinterface data copying are straightforward in BSD UNIX.

Reference-contexts: It is practical to have multiple interfaces within a workstation, individually associated with high-speed peripherals or processors. This makes it possible for data to be routed to and from these interfaces at gigabit rates independently of buses or backplanes <ref> [15] </ref>. 4.2 Mesh Routers Arrays of Mosaic chips can be interconnected with one another in a two dimensional mesh. In an ATOMIC LAN, meshes of Mosaic chips function as crossbar switches. <p> ATOMIC supports IP, but with a software change could support ATM or any network protocol. One additional point should be stressed. The low cost of nodes coupled with their programmability makes it practical to utilize them in workstation architecture <ref> [15] </ref>. The network is then extended into the workstation. This allows internal devices to have their own independent Gb/s interconnect in addition to direct network access. It has also been suggested that ATM could be used for this, although switching would be external [18][6].

Reference-contexts: ATM messages are of fixed length. Each is 53 bytes long with five bytes reserved for header, leaving a 48 byte payload. Several teams are creating prototype ATM host interfaces [11][12][8]. The Autonet follow-on, AN2, will have ATM switches <ref> [27] </ref>. ATOMIC sends variable length packets and it uses the distributed computational and routing capability of a mesh. This sets ATOMIC well apart from ATM-based LANs. The fragmentation and reassembly required when ATM carries higher layer traffic are not required in ATOMIC.

Reference-contexts: Simulation studies performed at Caltech have shown that under those conditions the achievable throughput across a bisection is approximately 50% of its theoretical maximum capacity. Since Mosaic channels provide 0.5Gb/s of capacity, a bisection provides 0.5nGb/s of capacity in either direction <ref> [29] </ref>. An n-by-n ATOMIC switch with hosts attached at its edges will normally deal with much more regular traffic routing patterns than were assumed for the above simulations. An n-by-n ATOMIC switch uses both X and Y directions to transmit packets.
