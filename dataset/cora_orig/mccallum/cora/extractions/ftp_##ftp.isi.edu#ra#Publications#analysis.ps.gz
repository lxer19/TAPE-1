Abstract: The Internet routing fabric is partitioned into several domains. Each domain represents a region of the fabric administered by a single commercial entity. Over the past two years, the routing fabric has experienced significant growth. From more than a year's worth of inter-domain routing traces, we analyze the Internet inter-domain topology, its route stability behavior, and the effect of growth on these characteristics. Such an analysis is important because inter-domain routing provides the foundation for Internet wide-area communication.

Reference-contexts: This indicates that the routing policies expressed in the Internet have remained relatively simple, despite the growth of the topology. It is conceivable that the lack of tools to configure and analyze inter-domain routing has prevented providers from realizing more complicated policies <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Accurately analyzing the routing system and its growth is extremely difficult.

Efforts are underway to establish Internet policy registries containing such information <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. Because the Internet is administratively decentralized, it is difficult to obtain a composite picture of the inter-domain topology and route stability.

Reference-contexts: However, we believe that the distribution of prefix availability and steadiness is likely to be similar at other backbone providers. 6 Related Work To our knowledge, no prior work has attempted to characterize the Internet inter-domain topology and its growth. Several researchers have proposed inter-domain topology models <ref> [3, 12, 17] </ref>. These models posit a three- or four-level provider hierarchy. Some of these models also assume that domains in a class primarily connect to domains in classes above or below their own. Our analysis confirms the existence of a four-level hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: We validated this by comparing the address prefix count in our snapshots with an independently collected history of the size of backbone routing tables <ref> [6] </ref>. In each case, our approximation was within 5% of the size of the routing table at the corresponding instant. This technique provides a richer view of the topology than an instantaneous dump of the routing table.

Reference-contexts: Two other studies have attempted to characterize Internet route stability. One analyzes a 12-hour trace of routing traffic on the now defunct NSFNET backbone network <ref> [7] </ref>. The Internet topology has changed significantly since then. This study analyzes routing protocol behavior: the frequency and size of updates, routing protocol convergence times and so on. It does not analyze prefix availability and steadiness characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Another measure of the growth in wide-area communication is the growth in aggregated backbone traffic; the utilization of the MAE-East Gigaswitch nearly doubled in the five months between May and September 1995 <ref> [8] </ref>. To understand the impact of the routing system on wide-area communication, we focus on two characteristics of the routing system: the inter-domain topology and route stability. What factors influence inter-domain topology and route stability? In today's Internet, the inter-domain topology is determined by bilateral transit agreements between providers.

Reference-contexts: Growth affects the amount of information routing protocols need to propagate and the storage and computational requirements of routers.

Reference-contexts: Backbones provide national or inter-continental transit, regionals serve a metropolitan area or a collection of such areas, and stubs provide campus level IP connectivity. Domains interconnect in several ways. The larger providers usually exchange traffic at neutral exchange points, such as MAE-East in Washington DC and the NSF-sponsored NAPs <ref> [10] </ref>. Stubs usually connect to their providers using direct leased lines. 2 By abstracting out the internal topology of domains, we can describe the Internet as an undirected graph whose nodes are the domains and whose links are the inter-domain interconnects.

Reference-contexts: Considering that a prefix usually represents an entity the size of a campus departmental network, this represents a significant rate of address prefix growth. The linearity of the growth curve offers some evidence of the ability of CIDR <ref> [11] </ref> to curtail the growth of the backbone routing table in the face of exponential Internet growth. The arrival patterns in D M are similar. There is some evidence in D A of two or more new prefixes arriving together. We see nearly 1700 such prefix arrival clusters.

Reference-contexts: When analyzing topology and route stability, it is important to understand how these characteristics change with growth. A unique feature of the Internet is the relatively rapid growth in the topology and the number of routed address prefixes, caused by the rapid increase in the number of connected hosts <ref> [13] </ref> and the deployment of a commercial Internet infrastructure. In June 1994, the routing system consisted of about 400 domains and 18,000 prefixes. By November 1995, it had grown to 900 domains and 31,000 prefixes.

Reference-contexts: With the growth of the routing system, it is reasonable to expect significant changes in these characteristics. With the emergence of the World-Wide Web and Mbone-based applications, wide-area communication is becoming more prevalent <ref> [14] </ref>. Understanding the topology and route stability behavior of the routing system is important for end-to-end protocol design and evaluation. <p> Characterizing the Inter-Domain Routing System The inter-domain routing system determines the perceived quality of wide-area communication in the Internet. Such wide-area communication is becoming increasingly prevalent; studies at one campus indicate that wide-area TCP connections originating at that campus domain grew exponentially <ref> [14] </ref>. Several factors, 3 including the rapid growth of the World-Wide Web, and the increasing use of the Mbone, account for this increase.

Reference-contexts: The Internet topology has changed significantly since then. This study analyzes routing protocol behavior: the frequency and size of updates, routing protocol convergence times and so on. It does not analyze prefix availability and steadiness characteristics. A second, more recent, study <ref> [15] </ref> uses the traceroute tool to sample availability and steadiness characteristics of paths between a small set of host pairs. Their end-to-end path availability estimates of 97% or higher appear to match our estimated host availability distribution; they too observe a degradation in host availability with Internet growth.

Reference-contexts: Domains may need to exercize traffic access restrictions and express transit preferences. Currently, domains realize these policies by selectively disseminating routing information. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) version 4 <ref> [16] </ref>, an inter-domain hop-by-hop routing protocol, is used for this purpose. In BGP, a domain may originate one or more routes. Routes advertise reachability to IP address prefixes within a domain. A domain realizes its traffic policies by independently selecting, and selectively propagating routes heard from its neighbors or peers.
