Title: AURORA: A Vision-Based Roadway Departure Warning System

Abstract: AURORA is a vision-based system designed to warn a vehicle driver of possible impending roadway departure accidents. It employs a downward looking color video camera with a wide angle lens, a digitizer, and a portable Sun Sparc workstation. Using a binormalized adjustable template correlation algorithm, it reliably detects lane markers on structured roads at 60 Hz. A time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) measurement is calculated for each image based on the estimation of vehicles lateral position and velocity. This measurement is used to trigger an alarm when the TLC falls below a preset threshold. Promising results have been achieved under a variety of weather and lighting conditions, on many road types.

Reference-contexts: While there are diverse scenarios and causal factors associated with SVRD crashes, they all have one characteristic in common: at some point in the crash sequence the vehicle leaves the roadway. 2 According to the FHWA <ref> [1] </ref>, up to 53 percent of SVRD accidents could be prevented by systems which detect the vehicles lateral position while driving.

Reference-contexts: This technique is similar to that employed by the SCARF road following system <ref> [2] </ref> to detect the boundary between the road and non-road regions on unstructured roads. Ignoring these regions of the template also makes the algorithm more tolerant to variations in the width of the lane marker. <p> Like human drivers, ALVINN relies on additional cues as to the road position, such as road edges or the ruts left by previous vehicles on a snowy roadway to cope with situations where the lane markings are degraded, obscured, or missing. The SCARF <ref> [2] </ref> system classifies individual pixels in the image as road or non-road based on their 16 color, and then uses a Hough transform to find the most probable road position, assuming the road appears as a trapezoid in the image.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach would lead to frequent false alarms, since people often drive with a fixed offset from the road center of up to 10 cm <ref> [3] </ref>. Another approach might be to base the warning on the vehicles lateral velocity, so that an alarm is triggered whenever the vehicle is travelling too quickly across the lane.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm would also lead to inappropriate alarms, since studies of human driver performance show that people tend to devote their attention to the steering task only intermittently <ref> [4] </ref>; the vehicle drifts slowly from the lane center, and then rapidly moves towards it when the driver makes a correction. These drawbacks are of serious concern since false alarm rates must be very low in such a warning system in order to avoid driver irritation. <p> These drawbacks are of serious concern since false alarm rates must be very low in such a warning system in order to avoid driver irritation. A better measure of roadway departure danger is time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) <ref> [4] </ref>. This is the time remaining before one of the vehicles wheels will cross over one of the lane boundaries, assuming a fixed steering strategy. In the constant offset case, the vehicles lateral velocity is near zero, so 13 TLC will be high and no warning will be triggered. <p> This is the algorithm currently employed in AURORA. AURORA bases its computation of TLC only on the vehicles lateral displacement and lateral velocity, since the human driving literature <ref> [4] </ref> and our own measurements (see Figure 10) indicate that the vehicles lateral acceleration is usually small between corrective maneuvers. AURORAs technique for computing lateral displacement was described earlier. To compute lateral velocity, AURORA uses the recent history of the vehicles lateral positions.

Reference-contexts: Because it only looks for trapezoidal region of road pixels, SCARF can not be used in situations like multi-lane driving and obstacle avoidance. VaMoRs <ref> [5] </ref> used local edge detectors to find the position of highway lane markers in various sub-regions of the image. A sophisticated control algorithm was employed to keep the vehicle in its lane.

Reference-contexts: Infrastructure based lateral position detection systems typically exploit ferromagnetic markers (generally wires or magnets) buried in the pavement <ref> [7] </ref>. Vehicle sensors detect these ferromag netic signals and use their intensity to calculate lateral position. They can achieve lateral position estimation accuracy on the order of several centimeters.

The laser scans nearly 180 degrees across the roadway and detectors within the device sense the intensity of reected laser light. The concrete or asphalt reects little of this laser light back to the detector.
