Abstract: We previously demonstrated that it is possible to learn position-independent responses to rotation and dilation by filtering rotations and dilations with different centers through an input layer with MT-like speed and direction tuning curves and connecting them to an MST-like layer with simple Hebbian synapses (Sereno and Sereno 1991). By analyzing an idealized version of the network with broader, sinusoidal direction-tuning and linear speed-tuning, we show analytically that a Hebb rule trained with arbitrary rotation, dilation/contraction, and translation velocity fields yields units with weight fields that are a rotation plus a dilation or contraction field, and whose responses to a rotating or dilating/contracting disk are exactly position-independent. Differences between the performance of this idealized model and our original model (and real MST neurons) are discussed.

Reference-contexts: In one model, the local rotation and dilation of the velocity field is first derived and then summed up across space to get invariant responses <ref> (Duffy and Wurtz 1991b) </ref>. This algorithm requires that MT neurons be selective to local rotation and dilation/contraction, which is generally not the case (Tanaka et al. 1986). Another model makes use of partially overlapping compartments in an MST receptive field (Saito et al. 1986).

Reference-contexts: Recently, it was demonstrated that although dilation-sensitive MSTd neurons are basically position-invariant in their responses, they often respond best to dilations centered at a particular location in the receptive field (often not the receptive field center) <ref> (Duffy and Wurtz, 1991c) </ref>. Similar results were obtained in the simulations in Sereno and Sereno (1991) using MT-like (narrower) input-layer tuning curves.

Reference-contexts: The model's response saturates at higher speeds (as a result of the sigmoid function) as does the response of real neurons (Orban et al. 1992). In addition to rotation and dilation/contraction, shear also naturally arises in the optic flow <ref> (Koenderink 1986) </ref>. Since the linear combination of shear fields is still a shear, according to (14) the weight vector field itself will also have a shear component. Consistent with the model, neurons selective to shear components were also found in the cortical areas including MST (Lagae et al. 1991).

Reference-contexts: Similar results were obtained in the simulations in Sereno and Sereno (1991) using MT-like (narrower) input-layer tuning curves. It may be advantageous to retain information about combinations of flow field components|here, dilation and translation|in single units since these combinations can have particular behavioral relevance|e.g., in signalling direction of heading <ref> (Perrone 1992) </ref>. More realistic peaked (instead of linear) speed tuning curves (Maunsell and Van Essen 1983) in the MT-like input layer could potentially sharpen the response to particular flow components since local speeds may be changed from the optimum as flow field components are added.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the unit has linear response to the speed v and a sinusoidal direction tuning curve with the maximum at the preferred direction (Fig. 1). The artificial MT-like units resemble the real neurons in area MT of monkey in certain respects <ref> (Rodman and Albright 1987) </ref>. For most MT neurons, speed does not alter the shape of direction tuning curves, which implies a multiplicative interaction of the speed tuning and the direction tuning as used in (1).
