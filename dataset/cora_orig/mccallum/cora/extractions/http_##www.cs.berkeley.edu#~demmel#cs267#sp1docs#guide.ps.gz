Title: ANL/MCS-TM-00 Users Guide for the ANL IBM SP-1 DRAFT  
Author: by William Gropp and Ewing Lusk Steven C. Pieper 
Affiliation: Mathematics and Computer Science Division  Physics Division MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE DIVISION  
Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 1
Reference: [1] <author> Ralph Butler and Ewing Lusk. </author> <title> Monitors, messages, and clusters: The p4 parallel programming system. </title> <journal> Journal of Parallel Computing. </journal> <note> To appear (Also Argonne National Laboratory Mathematics and Computer Science Division preprint P362-0493). </note>
Reference-contexts: Documentation: No implementation-specific documentation is yet available. Our implementation uses Chameleon, so the usual Chameleon methods of preparing programs and starting jobs apply. Supported Transport Layers: EUI, EUI-H, Ethernet/IP, Switch/IP. Contact: gropp@mcs.anl.gov or lusk@mcs.anl.gov for more information. 3.2.4 p4 p4 <ref> [1, 2] </ref> is a portable message-passing system that runs on a very wide variety of parallel systems and workstations. It is in use at approximately 200 sites around the world. Existing p4 programs will run unchanged on the SP-1.

Existing p4 programs will run unchanged on the SP-1. <p> Examples: `/usr/local/p4-1.3/examples' on bonnie contains C and Fortran examples, example makefiles, and a makefile that can be used to construct your makefiles with the appropriate options for the SP-1's vari ous transport layers. Documentation: `/home/lusk/ibm/p4-1.3/docs' contains the latexinfo source for the manual <ref> [2] </ref>, an ASCII version, and the postscript for a reference card. `/home/lusk/p4.manual' contains the postscript for the manual itself in (`p4.ps'). The manual is also online via info and any of the inside-Emacs or stand-alone info readers (e.g., gnu-info). 9 Supported Transport Layers: EUI, EUI-H, Ethernet/IP, Switch/IP.

Reference-contexts: Contact: fortran-m@mcs.anl.gov for more information. 8 3.2.3 MPI MPI (Message-Passing Interface) is a new message-passing system "standard" that has recently been defined by a broadly based group of parallel computing vendors, library writers (including us), and users. The current draft is now in the public-comment stage <ref> [3] </ref>. It should be finalized in the spring of 1994. The current draft is available in `/home/gropp/MPI/mpi-report.tex' and `mpi-report.ps'. A version is available on the World-Wide-Web. There are two preliminary implementations: one being done by us and a group from Mississippi State University, and the other being done by IBM.

Reference-contexts: Chameleon provides a common startup model that simplifies choosing a transport layer. Examples: `/home/gropp/tools.n/comm/examples' contains C and Fortran examples as well as makefiles. Documentation: `/home/gropp/tools.n/docs/tutorial/parallel.tex'. The script `/home/gropp/tools.n/bin/toolman' will start an xman for the manual pages for the Chameleon routines (and others). See also <ref> [4] </ref>. Supported Transport Layers: EUI, EUI-H, p4 Special Comments: The Chameleon makefiles provide portability by using names defined on the make command line. You should set ARCH=rs6000 and BOPT=g (for debugging) or BOPT=O (for production) and COMM=p4, COMM=eui, or COMM=euih for the transport layers p4, eui, and euih respectively.

Reference-contexts: This is useful for finding the cause of deadlock in parallel applications. 6.4 upshot Upshot <ref> [5] </ref> is a portable X Windows program for visualizing the behavior of a parallel program. Both Chameleon and p4 can generate the event logs that upshot reads. To generate an event log from Chameleon, use the -event flag a.out -np 4 -event This generates a file `bl'.
Reference: [6] <author> Peter Hochschild. </author> <title> Using EUIH: An Experimental EUI Implementation. </title> <institution> IBM, </institution> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: All 128 nodes may be accessed using EUI-H when the machine is configured for that (usually at night when a request has been made (see section 4.6 [Scheduling Use of the SP-1], page 17). Features specific to EUI-H are documented in <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.2 Parallel Programming Libraries We strongly encourage all programmers to use one or more of the systems described in this section when developing parallel programs for the SP-1. These have been used on other systems and have made it easy to port significant applications to the SP-1 very quickly.

Reference-contexts: EUI refers to the POE version. POE supports a parallel symbolic debugger (xpdbx) and a performance visualization tool (vt). However, its performance is inferior to EUI-H (latency is about 405 sec). In addition, at most 64 nodes are available to EUI. EUI is documented in <ref> [7] </ref>. 3.1.4 EUI-H EUI-H is an experimental, low-overhead implementation of the EUI interface. It does not support either xpdbx or vt. It is difficult to provide standard input to EUI-H programs (but see section 3.2.1 [Chameleon], page 7).
