Reference-contexts: Other Extensions Peter Wayner (private communication) has suggested a variation on MicroMint in which coins of different values are distinguished by publicly-known predicates on the x-values. 5 Relationship to Other Micropayment Schemes In this section we compare our proposals to the Millicent [10], NetBill <ref> [1] </ref>, NetCard [2], and Pederson [14] micropayment schemes. NetBill offers a number of advanced features (such as electronic purchase orders and encryption of purchased information), but it is relative expensive: digital signatures are heavily used and the NetBill server is involved in each payment.

Also, PayWord is a credit rather than debit scheme. Anderson, Manifavas, and Sutherland <ref> [2] </ref> have developed a micropayment system, "Net-Card," which is very similar to PayWord in that it uses chains of hash values with a digitally signed root. (The way hash chains are created differs in a minor way.) However, in their proposal, it is the bank rather than the user who prepares

Reference-contexts: value v 0 with key x under the Data Encryption Standard (DES): h (x) = [DES x (v 0 )] 1:::n : The broker purchases a number of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, each of which is capable of hashing approximately 2 25 (approximately 30 million) x-values per second. (See <ref> [3] </ref>.) Each such chip costs about $200; we estimate that the broker's actual cost per chip might be closer to $400 per chip when engineering, support, and associated hardware are also considered. The broker purchases 2 8 (= 256) of these chips, which costs him about $100,000.

Reference-contexts: M is signed by U and given to V . (Since this signature is necessarily "on-line," as it contains the vendor's name, the user might consider using an "on-line/off-line" signature scheme <ref> [5] </ref>.) This commitment authorizes B to pay V for any of the paywords w 1 , : : : , w n that V redeems with B before date D (plus a day's grace). Note that paywords are vendor-specific and user-specific; they are of no value to another vendor.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present two simple micropayment schemes, "PayWord" and "MicroMint," for making small purchases over the Internet. We were inspired to work on this problem by DEC's "Millicent" scheme [10]. Surveys of some electronic payment schemes can be found in Hallam-Baker <ref> [6] </ref>, Schneier [16], and Wayner [18]. Our main goal is to minimize the number of public-key operations required per payment, using hash operations instead whenever possible.

Reference-contexts: The first scheme, "PayWord," is a credit-based scheme, based on chains of "paywords" (hash values). Similar chains have been previously proposed for different purposes: by Lam-port [9] and Haller (in S/Key) for access control <ref> [7] </ref>, and by Winternitz [11] as a one-time signature scheme.

Reference-contexts: The CAFE project has filed for a patent on what we believe is an elaboration of Pedersen's idea. (The details off the CAFE scheme are not available to us.) Similarly following Pedersen's exposition, the iKP developers Hauser, Steiner, and Waid-ner have independently adopted a similar approach <ref> [8] </ref>. 16 6 Conclusions and Discussion We have presented two new micropayment schemes which are exceptionally economical in terms of the number of public-key operations employed. Furthermore, both schemes are off-line from the broker's point of view.

Reference-contexts: Since a user may access only a few pages before moving on, standard credit-card arrangements incur unacceptably high overheads. The first scheme, "PayWord," is a credit-based scheme, based on chains of "paywords" (hash values). Similar chains have been previously proposed for different purposes: by Lam-port <ref> [9] </ref> and Haller (in S/Key) for access control [7], and by Winternitz [11] as a one-time signature scheme. The application of this idea for micropayments has also been independently discovered by Anderson et al. [2] and by Pederson [14], as we learned after distributing the initial draft of this paper.

Our main goal is to minimize the number of public-key operations required per payment, using hash operations instead whenever possible. <p> The additional check of validity can be carried out both by the vendor and by the broker. (Having vendor-specific coins is also a major feature of the Millicent <ref> [10] </ref> scheme.) The obvious difficulty is that neither the broker nor the user can predict ahead of time which vendors the user will patronize, and it is unreasonable to force the user to purchase in advance coins specific for each possible vendor. <p> Other Extensions Peter Wayner (private communication) has suggested a variation on MicroMint in which coins of different values are distinguished by publicly-known predicates on the x-values. 5 Relationship to Other Micropayment Schemes In this section we compare our proposals to the Millicent <ref> [10] </ref>, NetBill [1], NetCard [2], and Pederson [14] micropayment schemes.

Reference-contexts: The broker may also keep a "hot list" of certificates whose users have reported lost keys, or which are otherwise problematic. As an alternative to hot-lists, one can use hash-chains in a different manner as proposed by Micali <ref> [12] </ref> to provide daily authentication of the user's certificate. The user's certificate would additionally contain the root w 0 0 of a hash chain of length 31.

[2] and by Pederson <ref> [14] </ref>, as we learned after distributing the initial draft of this paper. We discuss these related proposals further in Section 5. The user authenticates a complete chain to the vendor with a single public-key signature, and then successively reveals each payword in the chain to the vendor to make micropayments. <p> Other Extensions Peter Wayner (private communication) has suggested a variation on MicroMint in which coins of different values are distinguished by publicly-known predicates on the x-values. 5 Relationship to Other Micropayment Schemes In this section we compare our proposals to the Millicent [10], NetBill [1], NetCard [2], and Pederson <ref> [14] </ref> micropayment schemes. NetBill offers a number of advanced features (such as electronic purchase orders and encryption of purchased information), but it is relative expensive: digital signatures are heavily used and the NetBill server is involved in each payment. <p> This approach prevents the user from creating new chains, although a NetCard user could spend a single chain many times. Compared to PayWord, NetCard is debit-based, rather than credit-based. We have heard that a patent has been applied for on the NetCard system. Torben Pedersen outlines a micropayment proposal <ref> [14] </ref> that is also based on hash chains. His motivating application was for incremental payment of telephone charges. His paper does not provide much detail on many points (e.g. whether the system is credit or debit-based, how to handle exceptions, whether chains are vendor-specific, and other auxiliary security-related matters).

Reference-contexts: PayWord is thus extremely efficient when a user makes repeated requests from the same vendor, but is quite effective in any case. The public-key operations required by V are only signature verifications, which are relatively efficient. We note that Shamir's probabilistic signature screening techniques <ref> [17] </ref> can be used here to reduce the computational load on the vendor even further. Another application where PayWord is well-suited is the purchase of pay-per-view movies; the user can pay a few cents for each minute of viewing time.
