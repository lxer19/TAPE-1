Abstract: Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to problem formulation. The choice of objective function, constraints and design parameters can dramatically impact the computational cost of optimization and the quality of the resulting design. The best formulation varies from one application to another. A design engineer will usually not know the best formulation in advance. We have therefore developed a system that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system includes an executable, second-order data-flow language for representing optimization strategies. The language allows an engineer to define multiple stages of optimization, and to specify the design parameters, constraints and objectives to be handled at each stage. We have also developed a set of transformations that reformulate strategies represented in our language. The transformations can approximate objective and constraint functions, define new constraints, and re-parameterize or change the dimension of the search space, among other things. The system is applicable to design problems in which the artifact is governed by algebraic or ordinary differential equations. We have tested the system on problems of racing yacht and jet engine nozzle design. We report experimental results demonstrating that our reformulation techniques can significantly improve the performance of automatic design optimization.

Reference-contexts: He then uses the transform "Solve Equality Constraint" to remove one of the original parameters x i by solving y = Q (x 1 ; : : : ; x i ; : : : ; x n ) for x i symbolically (e.g. using Maple <ref> [ Char et al., 1992 ] </ref> at strategy construction time) or numerically (e.g., using Newton-Raphson at strategy execution time). The effect of these two transformations is to change the set of parameters used to describe points in the design space.

Reference-contexts: For example, the choice of approximation can be guided by sensitivity analysis. Likewise, ridges in evaluation functions can often be identified by diagonalization of the Hessian of the objective function. A collection of such diagnostic tools is presented in <ref> [ Gelsey et al., 1996 ] </ref> . We expect that full automation of the strategy reformulation process will require combinations of such numerical diagnostics with the symbolic methods we have described above. 8 Summary The performance of numerical design optimization can be significantly enhanced by symbolic reformulation techniques.

Reference-contexts: Consider first how approximations are used in numerical optimization algorithms. An illustrative example is CFSQP, a state of the art code for sequential quadratic programming <ref> [ Lawrence et al., 1995 ] </ref> . CFSQP is a "Quasi-Newton" method, which operates by approximating the objective with a quadratic function and solving the resulting quadratic program. The approximation-solution process is repeated until a fixed point is reached. CFSQP uses a purely numerical method to approximate the objective function.

A variety of numerical algorithms have been developed for attacking constrained optimization problems <ref> [ Press et al., 1986 ] </ref> . These numerical tools unfortunately provide only limited means of overcoming the difficulties described above. In particular, they take the objectives, constraints and design parameters as givens, provided in advance by a human user, and remaining fixed during solution of the problem. <p> Consider also how design parameters are used in numerical optimization algorithms. An illustrative example is Powell's direction set method <ref> [ Press et al., 1986 ] </ref> , a conjugate-gradient algorithm. Powell's method operates by computing a linear transformation of the design parameters to find "conjugate directions" and then uses transformed parameters to find an optimum. The transformation-solution process is repeated until a fixed point is reached.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to this, our work has focused on methods of reformulating the design parameters, constraints and objective functions themselves. Williams and Cagan present a method called "Activity Analysis" to identify opportunities for dimension reduction in design optimization <ref> [ Williams and Cagan, 1994 ] </ref> . Their method applies to situations in which dimension reduction is provably optimal. We have focused on engineering applications in which the complexity of the constraint and objective functions precludes such proof.
