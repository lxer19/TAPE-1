Abstract: We investigate, in the Shannon model, the security of constructions corresponding to double and (two-key) triple DES. That is, we consider F k 1 (F k 2 ()) and F k 1 (F 1 We obtain the first proof that composition actually increases the security in some meaningful sense. We compute a bound on the probability of breaking the double cipher as a function of the number of computations of the base cipher made, and the number of examples of the composed cipher seen, and show that the success probability is the square of that for a single key cipher. The same bound holds for the two-key triple cipher. The first bound is tight and shows that meet in the middle is the best possible generic attack against the double cipher.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis builds on techniques of [8] and [2]. Applications aside, we feel that we are looking at a basic information theoretic question, namely the power of cascaded ciphers.

Material omitted there due to space restrictions is included here. 1.4 Discussion on Implications of our result What implications do these results have for the security of real ciphers like DES? This is a question that needs to be addressed with some care.

Reference-contexts: There are several possible approaches to this question, depending on what kinds of attacks one wants to take into account. There are two main classes of attacks: * Cryptanalytic attacks: Like differential <ref> [3, 4] </ref> and linear [9] cryptanalysis * Generic attacks: Like exhaustive key search and meet-in-the-middle attacks. Generic attacks are, roughly, those that don't exploit the structure of the cipher, but work against any cipher, even an ideal one.
