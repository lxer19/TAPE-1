Abstract: In order to better understand life, it is helpful to look beyond the envelop of life as we know it. A simple model of coevolution was implemented with the addition of a gene for the mutation rate of the individual. This allowed the mutation rate itself to evolve in a lineage. The model shows that when the individuals interact in a sort of zero-sum game, the lineages maintain relatively high mutation rates. However, when individuals engage in interactions that have greater consequences for one individual in the interaction than the other, lineages tend to evolve relatively low mutation rates. This model suggests that different genes may have evolved different mutation rates as adaptations to the varying pressures of interactions with other genes.

A single generation consists of three steps: 1. All the organisms interact with each neighbor on either side. An organ ism's fitness score is the sum of two interaction scores. 2.

In this model, an interaction between two organisms, X and Y, consists of a comparison of X's offense gene bit pattern versus Y's defense gene bit pattern, and X's defense gene bit pattern versus Y's offense gene bit pattern.

Reference-contexts: The gene for mutation is an integer from 0 to 100. The mutation gene codes for the mutation rate of the offense and defense genes. Initially the model was implemented with the mutation gene coding for the mutation rates of all the genes, including itself <ref> [30] </ref>. This meant that if the mutation gene ever reached zero, all mutation and all evolution stopped. However, having this absorbing boundary at zero adds a bias to the average mutation rates over time.

Reference-contexts: However, others point out that the optimal mutation rate depends on how a solution is encoded as a genome <ref> [39] </ref> and the choice of fitness function to evaluate a solution.[4] Back goes as far as to include a gene for mutation rate in each solution in the population.[4] This allows a "schedule" of mutation rates over time. Early on, mutation rates tend to be high.

The results suggest that different forms of interactions put different evolutionary pressures on the mutation rates of the participants. Expressed genes should have evolved different intrinsic mutation rates as adaptations to their environment of interactions.
