Abstract: This paper describes initial work on the Domisilica project at Georgia Tech. We are exploring the dual augmentation of physical and virtual worlds in Domisilica and applying this novel concept to support home life beyond the boundaries of the actual house. We will demonstrate applications of dual augmentation in supporting distributed communities through a home (the Regency) and a specific appliance (CyberFridge), both of which serve as a communications link between physical and virtual worlds. Three specific types of communication are supported: direct (supporting real-time user-to-user interaction), indirect (interaction mediated by devices such as games, a refrigerator, etc), and peripheral (supporting awareness of subtle information).

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of mechanisms available for controlling and monitoring the environment. A simple and cheap approach is to use X10 [3] to control the power supply to devices combined with repeating IR for more programmable features. A more sophisticated control mechanism is CEBUS <ref> [1] </ref> , which allows actual programs to sit on physical devices. This is an industry standard that we are working toward as our long-term solution. The ParcTab/Pad ubiquitous computing project [25] and the PALplates project [16] both demonstrate adding new computing objects to the environment.

Reference-contexts: An augmented virtuality is a mirror world [11] whose computational state depends in part on some other environment (virtuality or reality). In the past, virtual spaces have been augmented by other virtual spaces [12] and by physical spaces <ref> [2, 19] </ref>, as in the Domisilica project. Most approaches to augmented reality enhance the user's perception of and interaction with the physical world in some way, either through visual means [9], or sound [18, 4].

Reference-contexts: Two projects which demonstrate physical interfaces are the Tangible Bits work [13] by Ishii, et. al. and the Digital desk [27]. These take the idea of adding displays to the real world to an even more integrated level. Augmentation has been used to foster collaboration <ref> [7, 5] </ref> for work environments, but although computer use has been studied in the home [24, 14], very little work has been done in exploring the type of computer-supported conferencing that might be appropriate to non-work settings. <p> The MUD can be viewed as a lowest common denominator of communication: information from the home is translated into the mud, and then reconstructed in an appropriate fashion depending on the remote user's choice of interface. This sort of heterogeneous communication (demonstrated in <ref> [5] </ref>) is uncommon in most collaborative environments. 5 Conclusions and Future Work In summary, we have discussed how dual augmentation can support a broader range of interactions across an augmented physical and virtual space.

Reference-contexts: MUDs/MOOs are particularly well suited to this integration both because of their history of successful community building (eg the MediaMOO project <ref> [6] </ref>) and because they use a metaphor of people, places, and things which maps naturally onto real-world places. One project which demonstrates this real/virtual integration is Jupiter [19], which provides home workers with access to a virtual model of their office place.

Our hypothesis is that by combining and integrating the types of spaces most effective at supporting physical communities (homes, conferences) with spaces which are successful at supporting virtual communities (eg MUDs/MOOs) we will be able to better support distributed communities.
