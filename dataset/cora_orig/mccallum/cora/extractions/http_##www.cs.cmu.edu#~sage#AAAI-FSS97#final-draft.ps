Abstract: The research reported here is part of an ongoing effort to design systems which can automatically generate integrated text and information graphics presentations. We are investigating the integration of two complementary approaches: hierarchical planning and task-based graphic design. A hierarchical planner is used to construct a media-independent plan of illocutionary actions which are ultimately decomposed into primitive actions of predicating and referring. This paper describes a proposed representation for complex referring actions. We provide an example presentation and discuss how its referring intentions would be represented in this approach, and discuss some implications of this approach for text and graphics generation.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The research reported here is part of an ongoing effort to design systems which can automatically generate multimedia (integrated text and information graphics) presentations from large data sets containing quantitative and relational information. As reported in a previous paper <ref> (Kerpedjiev et al. 1997) </ref>, we are investigating the integration of two complementary approaches to automatic design of presentations: hierarchical planning to achieve communicative goals and task-based graphic design. <p> For more information about the overall goals of our system, the research prototype which has been implemented in the domain of transportation scheduling, and examples of the types of presentations which it is intended to generate, see <ref> (Kerpedjiev et al. 1997) </ref>. (We are in the process of designing and implementing a new version of the system to make use of the new representation scheme.) In the next section, we provide an example presentation and discuss how its referring intentions would be represented in our approach.

Reference-contexts: The first computational system to represent referring intentions (KAMP) (Ap- pelt 1985) only addressed the planning of singular, definite, specific noun phrases not containing explicit quantifiers. Extending Searle's theory of speech acts <ref> (Searle 1970) </ref>, KAMP decomposed illocutionary actions into concept activation actions (comparable to the Activate actions used in our approach).

Reference-contexts: Re- searchers in graphics have emphasized the need to design presentations that support the perceptual and logical tasks a user must perform (Beshers & Feiner 1993; Casner 1991; Roth & Mattis 1990). In our hybrid approach, a hierarchical planner <ref> (Young, Moore, & Pollack 1994) </ref> is used to refine domain-specific but media-independent presentation goals into domain-independent and media-independent subgoals. (For simplicity, in the rest of this paper we shall refer to the domain-independent and media-independent level of the plan just as the media- independent level.) These media-independent goals are achieved by
