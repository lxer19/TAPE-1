Abstract: We consider the problem of determining, given a graph G and specified nodes s and t, whether or not there is a path of at most k edges in G from s to t. We show that solving this problem on polynomial-size unbounded fan-in circuits, requires depth (log log k), improving on a depth lower bound of (log fl k) when k = log O(1) n given in [2, 8]. In addition we show that there is a constant c such that for k log n, any depth d unbounded fan-in circuit for this problem requires size at least n ck * d where * d = 2d =3 and is the golden mean. This latter result improves on an n (log (d+3) k) bound from [2, 8] where log (i) is the i-fold composition of log with itself. The key to our technique is a new form of `switching lemma' which combines some of the features of iteratively shortening terms due to Furst, Saxe, and Sipser [13] and Ajtai [1] with the kinds of switching lemma arguments introduced by Yao [18], H-astad [14], and Cai [9] that have been the methods of choice for subsequent results.

Reference-contexts: This also gives polynomial-size fan-in 2 circuits of depth O (log n log k) for the problem. On unbounded fan-in circuits, ST CON N (k (n)) was first considered by Ajtai <ref> [2] </ref> who showed that for any function k (n) tending to infinity, ST CON N (k (n)) requires superpolynomial size on constant-depth circuits. <p> As noted above, Ajtai's bound says that for growing k we cannot ever reduce the depth complexity for efficiently computing ST CON N (k (n)) to a constant. An explicit computation of this non-constant lower bound and a simplification of the key lemma of <ref> [2] </ref> due to Bellantoni, Pitassi, and Urquhart [8] shows that Aj tai's technique gave an (log fl k) depth lower bound for polynomial-size unbounded fan-in circuits solving ST CON N (k (n)). <p> This latter result improves on an n (log (d+3) k) bound from <ref> [2, 8] </ref> where log (i) is the i-fold composition of log with itself. <p> and simpler formulation of H-astad's argument due to Woods (personal communication) and Razborov [16] which is developed further in [5] for a variety of other examples. 2 Definitions 2.1 Layered Graphs of Permutations The specific family of graphs we consider is the same as the one that Ajtai considered in <ref> [2] </ref>: Let G (n; k) be the set of all graphs with the following properties: Each graph G in G (n; k) has k + 1 disjoint layers of vertices, V 0 ; V 1 ; : : : ; V k , with each V i containing n vertices. <p> One of our original motivations for considering ST CON N (k (n)) was that the lower bound of <ref> [2] </ref> was the only one using an independent-set-style switching lemma that seemed impossible to improve using a H-astad-style switching lemma.

Reference-contexts: On unbounded fan-in circuits, ST CON N (k (n)) was first considered by Ajtai [2] who showed that for any function k (n) tending to infinity, ST CON N (k (n)) requires superpolynomial size on constant-depth circuits. For k = log !(1) n, H-astad's parity lower bound <ref> [14] </ref> implies that polynomial-size unbounded fan-in circuits for ST CON N (k (n)) require depth (log k= log log n) but this says nothing about short distances. <p> The key to our technique is a new form of `switching lemma' which combines some of the features of the "independent-set-style" switching lemma due to Furst, Saxe, and Sipser [13] and Ajtai [1] with the "Hastad-style" switching lemma arguments introduced by Yao [18], H-astad <ref> [14] </ref>, and Cai [9] that have been the methods of choice for subsequent results.

Although this is much weaker than the switching lemma from <ref> [14] </ref> the argument illustrates the essential features of our technique more clearly than does the proof of the connectivity switching lemma.

Reference-contexts: Another way of phrasing some of these complexity questions is to ask whether or not repeated squaring gives an optimal depth for polynomial-size circuits computing transitive closure or st-connectivity. (The O (log 1:5 n) space algorithm of Nisan, Szemeredi, and Wigderson <ref> [15] </ref> shows that for undirected graphs there is an algorithm that uses better space than repeated squaring but this does not yield improved depth polynomial-size circuits or say anything about directed connectivity.)
