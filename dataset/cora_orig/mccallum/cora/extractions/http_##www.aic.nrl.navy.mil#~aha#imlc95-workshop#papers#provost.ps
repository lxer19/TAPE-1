Abstract: The data describing resolutions to telephone network local loop "troubles," from which we wish to learn rules for dispatching technicians, are notoriously unreliable. Anecdotes abound detailing reasons why a resolution entered by a technician would not be valid, ranging from sympathy to fear to ignorance to negligence to management pressure. In this paper, we describe four different approaches to dealing with the problem of "bad" data in order first to determine whether machine learning has promise in this domain, and then to determine how well machine learning might perform. We then offer evidence that machine learning can help to build a dispatching method that will perform better than the system currently in place.

Analysis of the concept description learned by MAX explains why many examples are needed: very small disjuncts comprise a large portion of the concept description <ref> (Danyluk & Provost 1993a) </ref>. However, the results of these experiments are promising with respect to the potential for machine learning to model the behavior of human experts. Table 2: C4.5 results: expert classes. Size of test set = 100. Error rate with default class = 57.8.

Reference-contexts: Vercode is essentially a summary of the electrical readings produced by MLT. MAX was originally designed with the goal of using additional information to increase the performance of vercode alone. As the results in Table 4 show, the decision stumps <ref> (Holte 1993) </ref> learned by C4.5 on the field data perform much better than those learned with larger feature sets.
