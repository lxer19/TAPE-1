Abstract: Let G and H be two simple, undirected graphs. An embedding of the graph G into the graph H is an injective mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H, together with a mapping which assigns to each edge [u; v] of G a path between f(u) and f(v) in H. The grid M(r; s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, f(i; j) : 0 i &lt; r; 0 j &lt; sg, in which there is an edge between vertices (i; j) and (k; l) if either ji kj = 1 and j = l or i = k and jj lj = 1. In this paper, we give embeddings of complete binary trees into square grids and extended grids with total vertex-congestion 1, i.e., for any vertex x of the extended grid we have load(x) + vertex-congestion(x) 1. Depending on the parity of the height of the tree, the expansion of these embeddings is approaching 1:606 or 1:51 for grids, and 1:208 or 1:247 for extended grids.

Reference-contexts: The well-known H-tree layout of a complete binary tree into a grid from <ref> [2] </ref> produces a VLSI layout into a grid, whose expansion is approaching 2. The most recent result by Ducourthial and Merigot gives a layout whose expansion is approaching 1.891 or 1.758, depending on the parity of the height of the tree [3].

Reference-contexts: The most recent result by Ducourthial and Merigot gives a layout whose expansion is approaching 1.891 or 1.758, depending on the parity of the height of the tree <ref> [3] </ref>. Notice that the embeddings of complete binary trees from [5], [11] which have near optimal expansion are not of total congestion 1. Embeddings of complete binary trees into extended grids have been studied only recently. <p> The total vertex-congestion of this embedding is greater than one. Embeddings of complete binary trees T 2p , T 2p+1 into square extended grids, with total vertex-congestion 1 and expansion approaching 1:424, 1:411 respectively, are given in <ref> [3] </ref>. These embeddings are not layouts because of the initial embeddings they are constructed from, but they can be easily made into layouts by using different initial embeddings given here. <p> This approach was considered by Ducourthial and Merigot in <ref> [3] </ref>, where they obtained embeddings of complete binary trees into grids and extended grids with improved expansion. Starting with an embedding of T 3 into the rectangle M (5; 4) and an embedding of T 6 into M (15; 13), they obtained the following theorem. Theorem 2.1 [3] There exists a <p> and Merigot in <ref> [3] </ref>, where they obtained embeddings of complete binary trees into grids and extended grids with improved expansion. Starting with an embedding of T 3 into the rectangle M (5; 4) and an embedding of T 6 into M (15; 13), they obtained the following theorem. Theorem 2.1 [3] There exists a layout of the complete binary tree T 2p+1 into a square grid of size 2 p+1 + 2 p1 + 2 p2 1 for p 2, and of T 2p into a square grid of size 2 p + 2 p1 + 2 p2 + 2 p3 <p> From an embedding of a tree T h into a rectangle M (n; m), where n m + 1, we construct an embedding of T h+2 into a square grid of size n + m + 1 by the modified H-tree construction as in <ref> [3] </ref> (see the scheme of Figure 1b). <p> They started the constructions with an embedding of T 5 into the extended rectangle EM (10; 7) and an embedding of T 6 into EM (17; 8) which gave the following theorem. Theorem 3.1 <ref> [3] </ref> There exists an embedding with total vertex-congestion 1 of the complete binary tree T 2p+1 into a square extended grid of size 2 p+1 + 2 p2 + 2 p3 1 for p 3, and of T 2p into a square extended grid of size 2 p + 2 p1 <p> Similar to that of Theorem 2.4 and therefore omitted. 2 Note that this result is already better than the result from <ref> [3] </ref>. In case of extended grids, we can construct embeddings of lower expansion by using two variations of the general embedding scheme outlined in Section 2, called Construction 11 2 and Construction 3. Our embeddings are obtained recursively by alternating the use of these two constructions. <p> embedding of a tree T h into a rectangle EM (n; m), n m+1, containing a channel between the image of the root and a longer side of the rectangle, we construct an embedding of T h+2 into a square grid of side n + m + 1 as in <ref> [3] </ref> following the scheme of Figure 6a. Note that this embedding has a channel between the image of the root and a side of the grid. <p> The starting embeddings used to obtain our results are either the same or having the same expansion as those used in <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, the improved expansion of embeddings of Theorems 2.4, 3.5 is due to our embedding scheme, which obtains an embedding by combining 16 embeddings of subtrees into rectangular grids or extended grids.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the embeddings of complete binary trees from [5], [11] which have near optimal expansion are not of total congestion 1. Embeddings of complete binary trees into extended grids have been studied only recently.

This model requires an embedding of total vertex-congestion 1 of a complete binary tree into an extended grid.

Reference-contexts: Embeddings of a complete binary tree T 2p1 into its optimal square grid M (2 p ; 2 p ) with load one were considered in several papers. An embedding with nearly optimal dilation equal to (2 p1 1)=(p 1) + 2 is given in <ref> [6] </ref>. The vertex-congestion of this embedding is ((2 p1 1)=(p 1)). Embeddings having vertex-congestion 2 are given in [12] with dilation 4 3 2 p1 + O (1), and in [7] with dilation 2 p1 . Embeddings of trees into grids were also studied for the purpose of VLSI layouts.

Reference-contexts: Many of the results on the embeddings related to parallel computations deal with the problem of embedding different types of graphs into grids and hypercubes, since they are used in several large scale parallel computers (see <ref> [9] </ref>). However, the MasPar computer ([1],[8]), although often cited as a computer that uses a grid interconnection network, allows each interior node of the grid to communicate directly with eight nodes corresponding to the neighbourhood of a vertex in the extended grid.

Reference-contexts: T 2p1 into a grid requires that the dilation is (2 2p =2p), any VLSI layout must be done in a square grid that is larger than the optimal square grid M (2 p ; 2 p ), which has only one more vertex than required for embedding T 2p1 <ref> [10] </ref>. The well-known H-tree layout of a complete binary tree into a grid from [2] produces a VLSI layout into a grid, whose expansion is approaching 2.
