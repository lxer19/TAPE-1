Reference-contexts: Our future efforts will seek to provide a comprehensive delay model for multi-input gates. This will include single and dual-input macromodels for delay and output transition times with respect to each input. We also plan to use this technique for the CGaAs <ref> [1] </ref> technology.

Reference-contexts: The combined effect of submicron feature sizes and larger die areas are forcing a reassessment of the conventional models for gate and interconnect delays. The earliest gate delay models accounted for such effects as load capacitance and transistor sizes <ref> [2] </ref>. More recently, the dependence of delay on the finite transition times of digital signals has been recognized by several researchers [6], [10], [14], [16] and incorporated in commercial delay calculators [18]. In this paper, we address the dependence of gate delay on the temporal proximity of input transitions.

Reference-contexts: However, while the case of single-input switching has received a lot of attention, the proximity effect is just starting to be addressed in the literature. Many attempts to model the delay of multi input gates assume only one input is switching <ref> [3] </ref>, [11], [15] and thus do not take temporal proximity of input transitions into account. We now review the research that does consider multiple switching inputs.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the input and output thresholds are chosen to be . However, it can be easily shown that a choice of input threshold above (below) for rising (falling) input can give rise to negative delays for very slow inputs <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, is not a robust choice, as it could be slightly lower or higher than . Choosing instead is not useful either because the delay approaches zero in the limit as the input is made arbitrarily slow.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we address the dependence of gate delay on the temporal proximity of input transitions. This effect was identified by a number of researchers [8], [13] and represents a form of state-dependency <ref> [5] </ref>, [17]. To date, however, the modeling approaches proposed to capture proximity effects are incomplete, inaccurate, or specific to particular design styles. The proximity model we introduce in this paper attempts to remedy these shortcomings.

We now review the research that does consider multiple switching inputs. In <ref> [8] </ref>, an equivalent waveform is found from the ones that are switching and the multi-input gate is collapsed into an inverter by series parallel reduction of the transis tors. The justifications for deriving the equivalent waveform are not clearly stated. <p> Their method reduces to that of <ref> [8] </ref> when the inputs switch together and their transition times are small. This method also finds an equivalent input waveform which is then applied to the inverter derived from the multi-input gate and is principally geared towards calculating the peak supply current.

Reference-contexts: We note that delay and transition time functions, when input alone is switching, can be written as: (3.3) Dimensional analysis has been shown to be a powerful tool in reducing the number of parameters in a macromodel <ref> [9] </ref>. Using this technique (3.3) and (3.4) can be written as follows: (3.5) In a cell-based design environment and for a given process, the ratios of the pullup and pulldown transistors is fixed and the designer has no control over the threshold voltages. <p> These ratios can then be absorbed into the function and the resulting functional forms are <ref> [9] </ref>: (3.7) Note that the functions and in (3.5), (3.7) and (3.6), (3.8) are not the same. However, to reduce clutter we use the same symbols. This will hold true throughout the rest of the paper. Equations (3.7) and (3.8) capture the effect of the non-temporal parameters. <p> By using dimensional analysis, we can reduce them to the following forms <ref> [9] </ref>: (3.11) Thus, we have expressed the delay and output transition times as functions of temporal parameters only. So far we have not distinguished between the two inputs in any way.

Hence, some researchers have used ) for the input threshold and for the output threshold in case of rising (falling) inputs <ref> [10] </ref>. This definition of delay always gives a monotonically increasing delay value with increasing input transition time. These two thresholds also provide a logical choice for measuring input and output transition times. <p> Note that the larger error in output transition times can be tolerated since the effect of out put transition time gets attenuated by the gain of the following stage <ref> [10] </ref>. 6 Inertial delay and proximity effect We now digress briey to show the relationship between inertial delay and proximity effect. Referring to Figure 6-1 (a), assume input falls and input rises.
