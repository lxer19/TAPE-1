Abstract: Background subtraction" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence|for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a time-averaged background image will leave only nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using an unsupervised technique|an efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, the pixel models describe the probability distribution of the appearance of the pixel conditioned on its type, where the type is a hidden variable. In this paper, the pixel appearance is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians, and is learned using the EM algorithm <ref> [ Dempster et al., 1977 ] </ref> . The details are given in Section 4, where we also describe an incremental version of the algorithm that provides real-time performance. We show that our approach is successful in coping with slow-moving objects and shadows (Section 5). <p> Thus, we define the likelihood with respect to the observable data: L (fi) = T t=1 P (I (x; y; t) j fi). Learn ing mixture models is one of the classic examples of missing values. The standard solution in the literature is the expectation maximization algorithm <ref> [ Dempster et al., 1977; 7 McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997 ] </ref> . Roughly speaking, the EM algorithm explores a sequence of parameter settings, where each setting is found by using the previous one to classify the data. More precisely, assume that we have some parameter setting fi k .

Reference-contexts: In any case, this level of models should interface nicely with the higher-level dynamic belief network models of vehicle behaviour used in <ref> [ Huang et al., 1994 ] </ref> to predict motions and to detect events such as stalled vehicles and accidents.

Reference-contexts: simple fix such as lightening or thresholding might work to eliminate shadows, but these schemes may fail because parts of the road may be shadowed by buildings, and because of road markings|a shadow falling on a white line can still result in a brighter pixel than sunlight falling on tarmac <ref> [ Kilger, 1992 ] </ref> . As mentioned in the introduction, another serious problem arises when objects are slow-moving or temporarily stationary. Here, "slow-moving" means that the time of traversal is non-negligible compared with 1=ff, the time constant of the exponential forgetting process in Equation (1).

Reference-contexts: The details of the method are described briefly in Section 2. In earlier work as part of the Roadwatch project at Berkeley, it was shown that background subtraction can provide an effective means of locating and tracking moving vehicles in freeway traffic <ref> [ Koller et al., 1994 ] </ref> . Moving shadows do, however, cause serious problems, since they differ from the background image and are therefore identified as parts of the moving objects. Moreover, when traffic is slow-moving or stationary, the background image becomes corrupted by the vehicles themselves. <p> Unlike the moving-window method, this requires no additional storage. Exponential forgetting is equivalent to using a Kalman filter to track the background image, as done in <ref> [ Koller et al., 1994 ] </ref> . Although there are a few stray pixels identified as "moving" due to image noise, the vehicles 3 (a) (b) (c) forgetting. (b) Current image (frame 925). (c) Thresholded difference image showing pixels associated with moving objects. are outlined reasonably well.

Reference-contexts: Second, if fi k+1 = fi k , then fi k is a stationary point (e.g., a local maximum) of the likelihood function. Combining these two properties, we see that this procedure will eventually converge to a stationary point <ref> [ McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997 ] </ref> . If we start the process several times with different setting of fi 0 , we hope to find a good approximation to the optimal setting.

Reference-contexts: The sharp-eyed reader will have spotted that the background subtraction method succeeds not only in detecting moving vehicles, but also their shadows. 1 In practice, shadows have been one of the most serious problems for video-based traffic surveillance in both commercial and research systems <ref> [ Michalopoulos, 1991 ] </ref> , sometimes resulting in undercounting or overcounting by as much as 50%.
