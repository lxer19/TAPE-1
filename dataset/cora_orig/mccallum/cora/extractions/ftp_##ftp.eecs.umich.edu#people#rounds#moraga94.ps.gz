Reference-contexts: In that case, her 2/3 subjective degree of belief would not be as correct as it could be. Traveling to Australia might help refine the defaults. Our definition bears a strong resemblance to the notion defined by Bac-chus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller <ref> (Bacchus et al. 1993.) </ref> Their definition of the conditional probability of a statement given another statement ', though, is not made with reference to a given default information system.

Reference-contexts: The typical gloss of this is "birds normally fly." So, in terms of (one version of) situation theory, one would take ff and fi as types, as in the "smoke means fire" paradigm of Devlin (Devlin 1991.) In later work, Barwise <ref> (Barwise 1989) </ref> suggests that this relation, as a relation between types, would be an indicating relation, to be accompanied by a corresponding signaling relation s 1 ! s 2 , where s 1 is a "site" supporting ff, and s 2 is a site supporting fi. <p> The point of default reasoning is that we use such information virtually all the time. This scenario has of course been extensively studied in artificial intelligence. Barwise has also given a situation-theoretic treatment of it in <ref> (Barwise 1989, chapter 5) </ref>, where the additional idea of background type was introduced.

Reference-contexts: involving the well-known (folk?) "Nixon Diamond." To this end, we introduce a notion both of non-monotonic consequence j~ which can be used to state default constraints, and, in the finite case, a probabilistic notion of "degree of belief" useful in analyzing the examples. 2 Relations to standard AI approaches Etherington <ref> (Etherington 1988) </ref> gave the first model-theoretic semantics to Reiter's default logic. This was a system based on sets of first-order models. Marek, Nerode, and Remmel (Marek et al. 1990), gave a semantics for nonmonotonic rule systems. They translated Reiter's default rules into finitary formulas of a certain special infinitary logic.

Reference-contexts: This raises a question about limits as n gets large, a topic which we must defer here. The full story is more nearly told in <ref> (Grove et al. 1992) </ref>, which refers to the notion of limit law for models in first-order logic. The problem seems to be that in many examples of the above type, there is covergence of the subjective degree of belief measure in models of size n as n grows without bound.

Reference-contexts: But these systems of defaults can be giving a lot of non-information and even false information in a probabilistic sense. They, and the default constraints themselves, should be undergoing revision. We illustrate this by considering an anomaly of Poole (Poole 1989), related to the so-called "lottery paradox" <ref> (Jr. 1961) </ref>; and we consider a more complex case involving the well-known (folk?) "Nixon Diamond." To this end, we introduce a notion both of non-monotonic consequence j~ which can be used to state default constraints, and, in the finite case, a probabilistic notion of "degree of belief" useful in analyzing the

Reference-contexts: We have chosen a restricted, positive version of first-order logic, which only allows negation on atomic formulas. Then we introduce a notion j~ of non-monotonic consequence between sentences of first-order logic, as in Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor <ref> (Kraus et al. 1990.) </ref> We say that in a default model structure, one sentence non-monotonically entails a second if the second holds in all extensions of "small" partial models of the first. Here "smallness" is interpreted with respect to the natural partial order associated with a Scott domain.

Reference-contexts: But these systems of defaults can be giving a lot of non-information and even false information in a probabilistic sense. They, and the default constraints themselves, should be undergoing revision. We illustrate this by considering an anomaly of Poole <ref> (Poole 1989) </ref>, related to the so-called "lottery paradox" (Jr. 1961); and we consider a more complex case involving the well-known (folk?) "Nixon Diamond." To this end, we introduce a notion both of non-monotonic consequence j~ which can be used to state default constraints, and, in the finite case, a probabilistic notion <p> This gives a way of thinking about the usual "birds normally fly" as a pseudo-probabilistic statement. We illustrate this method in the resolution of an anomaly with standard default reasoning, due to Poole <ref> (Poole 1989.) </ref> The paper is organized as follows. In section 3 we cover the basics of domain theory and information systems, introduce our non-monotonic generalization, and state a representation theorem for default domains. In Section 4 we show how to interpret first-order positive logic using default models. <p> By "subjective probability" we mean an analogue of the usual probability, a number that would be assigned to a statement by a particular agent or subject, given a default system and some basic constraints on the world. Let us illustrate with an example of Poole <ref> (Poole 1989.) </ref> 5.1 Poole's anomaly Assume that there are exactly three mutually exclusive types of birds: penguins, hummingbirds, and sandpipers. It is known that penguins don't fly, that hummingbirds are not big, and that sandpipers don't nest in trees. Now suppose we want to assert that the typical bird flies.

Reference-contexts: So "penguins are birds" is just given as the usual universally quantified sentence (Horn sentence) expressing the constraint. We use background constraints to govern partial models of first-order logic. These models are constructed using systems of default rules, as in the default logic of Reiter <ref> (Reiter 1980) </ref>, but where Reiter's rules build logical theories, our rules build models. Our approach takes advantage of domain-theoretic notions.

Reference-contexts: We encode a constraint theory into the monotonic forcing relation ` of a Scott information sys 3 tem appropriate for a first-order logic semantics. How to accomplish this encoding was not absolutely clear. One possibility is to use a generalization of information systems themselves, due to Saraswat and Panangaden <ref> (Saraswat et al. 1991) </ref>, to the first-order case. We have determined, however, that such a move is unneccessary. We represent constraint theories as a special case of ordinary monotonic information systems. The next problem is how to add a non-monotonic component to information systems.

Reference-contexts: Our approach takes advantage of domain-theoretic notions. A system of default rules is a straightforward generalization of Scott's notion of information system <ref> (Scott 1982.) </ref> We think of these default systems as "programs" which are created by a reasoning agent to satisfy default constraints. We show how to treat the standard penguin example in our system, and we give what we hope are some other amusing case studies.

Reference-contexts: We are offering the results of our investigations in that spirit, hoping that this will be a start on the problem of putting the work in standard AI approaches to non-monotonicity together with current work on information flow <ref> (Seligman and J.Barwise 1993.) </ref> We are interested in the subject of default or "normal" inferencing. On the surface of things, this can be exemplified within propositional logic using a non-monotonic consequence relation ff j~ fi between sentences ff and fi. <p> This idea was subsequently refined, both by Barwise and by Seligman <ref> (Seligman and J.Barwise 1993) </ref>, into the idea of an information channel. In channel theory, pairs s1 ! s2 are classified by some channel as being of type ff ) fi or not.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, every Scott domain is isomorphic to a domain of such ideal elements. These results are basic in domain theory, and have been generalized to other classes of complete partial orders by Zhang <ref> (Zhang 1991) </ref> and others. 5 3.2 Default Information Systems We generalize the theory of information systems by simply adding a default component. We should mention at this point that we limit ourselves to the so-called normal default structures.
