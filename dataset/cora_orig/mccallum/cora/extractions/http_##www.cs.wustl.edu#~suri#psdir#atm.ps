Abstract: Integrated network technologies, such as ATM, support multimedia applications with vastly different bandwidth needs, connection request rates, and holding patterns. Due to their high level of flexibility and communication rates approaching several gigabits per second, the classical network planning techniques, which rely heavily on statistical analysis, are less relevant to this new generation of networks. In this paper, we propose a new model for broadband networks and investigate the question of their optimal topology from a worst-case performance point of view. Our model is more flexible and realistic than others in the literature, and our worst-case bounds are among the first in this area. Our results include a proof of intractability for some simple versions of the network design problem, and efficient approximation algorithms for designing nonblocking networks of provably small cost. More specifically, assuming some mild global traffic constraints, we show that a minimum-cost nonblocking star network achieves near-optimal cost; the cost ratio is at most 2 if switch source and sink capacities are symmetric, and at most 3 when the total source and sink capacities are balanced. In the special case of unit link costs, we can show that a star network is indeed the cheapest nonblocking network.

Reference-contexts: It is not difficult to see that even with shortest available path routing, connections can block when a simple rearrangement of routes will free up enough bandwidth to accept the new connection. The following theorem, proved in <ref> [4] </ref>, shows that determining whether a given network blocks some sequence of switch capacity-compliant connection requests is NP-Hard. Theorem 3.1 [4] Let V be a set of switches, let ff (u); !(u) be their source and sink capacities, and let ` (u; v) be the capacity of link (u; v). <p> The following theorem, proved in <ref> [4] </ref>, shows that determining whether a given network blocks some sequence of switch capacity-compliant connection requests is NP-Hard.

Reference-contexts: A major source of difficulty is that, without the linearity of link costs, the combination equation for the lower bound Eq. (5) does not hold. Details on some practical heuristics and their performance can be found in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Finally, while global traffic constraints are clearly appealing to network designers, they can lead to overly expensive network designs. There is a trade-off here between minimizing the amount of information required of the network manager and providing enough information to yield the most cost-effective designs.

Reference-contexts: The constants c 1 and c 2 are technology-dependent, but currently c 1 AE c 2 , and so the majority of the switch cost can be effectively combined with the link costs whenever L is too large|see Turner <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus, having a provable cost guarantee for star networks has a lot of appeal, and it remains a tantalizing problem to determine the best possible approximation bound for a star network.
