Title: Shading Primitives: Finding Folds and Shallow Grooves  
Author: John Haddon and David Forsyth 
Address: Berkeley CA 94720  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California,  
Abstract: Diffuse interreflections cause effects that make current theories of shape from shading unsatisfactory. We show that distant radiating surfaces produce radiosity effects at low spatial frequencies. This means that, if a shading pattern has a small region of support, unseen surfaces in the environment can only produce effects that vary slowly over the support region. It is therefore relatively easy to construct matching processes for such patterns that are robust to interreflections. We call regions with these patterns shading primitives. Folds and grooves on surfaces provide two examples of shading primitives; the shading pattern is relatively independent of surface shape at a fold or a groove, and the pattern is localised. We show that the pattern of shading can be predicted accurately by a simple model, and derive a matching process from this model. Both groove and fold matchers are shown to work well on images of real scenes.

Reference-contexts: Nayar's method [16] for extracting a dense depth map uses estimates of interreflections, but does not take into account the effects of shadows, and of distant surfaces. Belhumeur et al. <ref> [1] </ref> showed that different surfaces under different illumination conditions can yield the same image. To overcome the difficulty of finding dense depth maps, one may either change the type of shape representation sought in the shading field, or the model of shading.

Reference-contexts: This simple model allows us to predict the radiosity given a particular groove shape. 4.2 Confirming the model In order to confirm our shading model, we wish to compare the theoretical predictions of radiosity profiles to those obtained from real images. A support vector machine <ref> [3] </ref> trained on theoretical data predicted from the model gives a low false negative rate on real images, indicating that the model accurately reflects reality. Procedures. <p> Negative examples were taken from randomly chosen lines in random images. Comparison. A support vector machine is a learning machine that determines the hyperplane in the feature vector space which best separates the positive and negative data <ref> [3] </ref>. We trained an SVM using theoretical data for positive examples. None of the real groove cross-sections tested negative, no matter what their shadow position was, indicating that the test data (from experimental images) are consistent with the model data (theoretically generated). Thus, our simple groove model reflects reality accurately.

Reference-contexts: This model of shading omits the effects of diffuse inter-reflections, a source of various substantial effects that are noticeable to human observers [17] and represent an important component of shading in most real scenes <ref> [4] </ref>. Diffuse interreflections create significant computational diffi culties, because brightness at a patch is not simply a function of the surface normal, but a function of all radiating surfaces, modelled by the radiosity equation [18].

Reference-contexts: The other approach, as advocated by Forsyth and Zisserman, is to attempt to build a dictionary of corresponding stylised shape and shading events, so that shading properties that are stable under interreflections can be used to infer a shape representation <ref> [5] </ref>. In our opinion, the best prospect for extracting shape information from shading is to construct programs that observe stylised properties of shading and associate those properties with shape primitives or their properties.
