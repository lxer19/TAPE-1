Abstract: In a series of papers, Donoho and Johnstone develop a powerful theory based on wavelets for extracting non-smooth signals from noisy data. Several nonlinear smoothing algorithms are presented which provide high performance for removing Gaussian noise from a wide range of spatially inhomogeneous signals. However, like other methods based on the linear wavelet transform, these algorithms are very sensitive to certain types of non-Gaussian noise, such as outliers. In this paper, we develop outlier resistant wavelet transforms. In these transforms, outliers and outlier patches are localized to just a few scales. By using the outlier resistant wavelet transforms, we improve upon the Donoho and Johnstone nonlinear signal extraction methods. The outlier resistant wavelet algorithms are included with the S+Wavelets object-oriented toolkit for wavelet analysis.

Reference-contexts: The principle is that noise contributes to many coefficients but features contribute to only a few coefficients. Hence, by setting the smaller coefficients to zero in a statistically guided manner, we can nearly optimally eliminate noise while preserving the underlying signal.

The arcs represent conceptual links between objects. The toolkit offers an array of basic building blocks, including waveform "atoms" and "crystals", wavelet filters, and time frequency dictionaries.

Wavelets are not an appropriate basis for analysis of all types of signals. Researchers have offered various alternative bases, such as wavelet packets and local cosine bases.

Reference-contexts: A statistically attractive form for the thresholding function is a soft threshold: ffi i (x) = 0 if jxj i sign (x)(jxj i ) if jxj &gt; i (2) Note that the threshold i may vary from level to level. <ref> [3] </ref> Apply the inverse wavelet transform to obtain the estimated smooth ^ X. <p> Figure 3 (a) plots the signal contaminated by non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Figure 3 (b) gives the L 2 projection at level 4 (decimation of the original signal by 2 4 ) using the "least asymmetric" orthogonal wavelet with a filter of length 8 <ref> [3] </ref>. For illustrative purposes, a non-decimating shift invariant projection is performed [12]. <p> The smearing is undesirable since it then is difficult to isolate and identify the outlier patch (as in the L 2 case). On the other hand, it is desirable to have longer filters to ensure sufficient smoothness with the underlying basis functions. The "b-spline" biorthogonal wavelets <ref> [3] </ref> is one class of filters which satisfy both requirements: short filters can be used for decomposition while longer filters for reconstruction. 4.1.2 Choice of Robust Filter The robust filter should be simple, computationally fast to compute, and have a very high breakdown point. <p> In practice, only two passes of the robust smoother-cleaner operations are necessary to clean the data. The resulting decomposition contains the usual wavelet coefficients plus j 1 sets of robust residuals. contaminated jumpsine data. The "b-spline" biorthogonal wavelet 1;5 <ref> [3] </ref> is used for this example. The smooth is very similar to the estimate obtained by the zero cone procedure.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we can more easily remove outliers from the L 1 decomposition. Note also that the edges of the level shift are better preserved with the L 1 decomposition. The concentration of coefficients in the L 1 decomposition indicates that robust decompositions may have applications to data compression problems <ref> [4] </ref>. 3.2 Smooth But Robust Fits We can extend L 1 fitting to general wavelet bases and hence, obtain smoother projections. As an approximation, ` 1 fits can be used which are easily computed using using standard ` 1 regression techniques. <p> In a complimentary research project, we are developing S+Wavelets, an object-oriented toolkit for wavelet analysis.

We are developing other new algorithms for robust wavelet analysis. In one approach, we develop a nonlinear triadic refinement scheme in which the wavelet coefficients are possibly nonlinear combinations of finitely many block medians at a given scale.

Reference-contexts: The smooth is completely automatic: no tuning constants are required (other than the choice of the wavelet filter and thresholding rule). The WaveShrink algorithm can be extended to other orthonormal bases as well, such as wavelet packets and local cosine bases <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 ROBUST WAVELET DECOMPOSITIONS The theory of Donoho and Johnstone demonstrates that wavelets provide a powerful framework for denoising data. However, this theory is based on the assumption that the noise * i is close to a Gaussian distribution.
