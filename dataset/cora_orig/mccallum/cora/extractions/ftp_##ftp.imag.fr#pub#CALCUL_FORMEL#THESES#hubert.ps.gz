Reference-contexts: They can in fact be given as converging Puiseux series in x. M.3 A polygon process A polygon process as introduced by Briot and Bouquet in <ref> [BB56] </ref> and Fine [Fin89] will manage the integral power series at a regular point, without derivating the equation, as well as the Puiseux series solutions at a regular singular point, without going through the Legendre transform.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, it appears that these ideals together with the Rosenfeld-Grobner decomposition could replace the prime differential ideals in the fundamental role they play in the development of the theory [PG97, part I]. Lazard's lemma <ref> [BLOP95] </ref> settles the crucial properties of regular ideals in poly nomial rings. These properties are readily lifted to the polynomial differential ring by Rosenfeld's lemma to give the following theorem, which can be seen as a generalization of [Ros59, III, Theorem 3]. <p> The proof of this theorem can be found in <ref> [BLOP95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Ce sont essentiellement ces notions algorithmiques, pas toujours effectives, qui ont retenu l'attention scientifique ces dernieres annees. La methode de Seidenberg fut amelioree et implantee par S.Diop [Dio89]. Reprenant les idees mises en oeuvre et avec la complicite d'un lemme de Rosenfeld et un lemme de Lazard, F.Boulier <ref> [Bou94] </ref> a aboutit a un algorithme qui permet une decomposition ayant des proprietes d'une nature voisine a celle de Ritt. En restant sur l'approche de Ritt, K.Rody a egalement obtenu une decomposition similaire pour les equations differentielles ordinaires. <p> u p and s p are respectively the leader and the initial of p when is a proper derivation operator, that is when ord &gt; 0. p = i p u d p + + i 0 F.Boulier, wrote a nice presentation of reduction algorithms in terms of rewrite systems <ref> [Bou94] </ref>. The reader can also refer to [Kol73, I.8] for a more detailed treatment of what follows. A differential polynomial q is partially reduced w.r.t. p if no proper derivatives of u p appears in q. <p> It is a crucial point in many proofs of termination of algorithms and in the following definition. F.1.3 Definition: Let be an non-empty subset of F fY g. An auto-reduced subset A of is a characteristic set of if it satisfies one of the equivalent properties <ref> [Bou94, 1.3] </ref>: * A is an auto-reduced subset of of lowest rank * has no non-zero element reduced w.r.t. A. If is a finite subset, determining a characteristic set of is simply a question of making a finite number of comparisons of rank. <p> Let G be a Grobner basis of (A) : h 1 A in F [fi A Y ] according to such an order. (A) : h 1 A contains an element reduced w.r.t. A if and only if G contains such an element <ref> [Bou94] </ref>. One could also answer on the primality of (A) : h 1 A . In [BW93, chapter 8] or [GTZ88] are presented algorithms to compute a prime and a primary decomposition of an algebraic ideal. <p> So one should first question the need for (A) : h 1 A to be prime since Rosenfeld's lemma has a wider range of application. This question was first raised by F.Boulier <ref> [Bou94] </ref>. F.4 Decomposition into regular ideals The notion of regular ideals was introduced with the algorithm Rosenfeld-Grobner [Bou94] which first handled them. <p> So one should first question the need for (A) : h 1 A to be prime since Rosenfeld's lemma has a wider range of application. This question was first raised by F.Boulier <ref> [Bou94] </ref>. F.4 Decomposition into regular ideals The notion of regular ideals was introduced with the algorithm Rosenfeld-Grobner [Bou94] which first handled them. Basically, an ideal R is regular, for a certain ranking, if R = (A) : h 1 A , where A is an auto-reduced coherent subset of F fY g.

Reference-contexts: That A is coherent is only a sufficient condition: there exist auto-reduced sets which satisfy the above property though they are not coherent (see the example of <ref> [Bou96, section 5] </ref> ). Nonetheless, when dealing with prime differential ideals this becomes a necessary and sufficient condition [Kol73, IV.9, lemma 2].

Reference-contexts: A if and only if G contains such an element [Bou94]. One could also answer on the primality of (A) : h 1 A .

If F is computable, we may even compute a (Grobner) basis of (fi u o p) : s 1 p <ref> [BW93] </ref>. This summarizes into the following proposition 2 . H.1.1 Proposition: Consider a computable field F and a sequential 3 ranking on F fY g. Let p be an irreducible differential polynomial of F fY g, u p its leader and s p its separant. <p> an ideal I in K [x; y 0 ; : : : ; y ! ] according to an order where x is reverse prevailing, then G is also a Grobner basis of the ideal generated by I in K (x)[y 0 ; : : : ; y ! ] <ref> [BW93, lemma 8.93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Le chapitre IV de la bible de l'algebre differentielle ecrite par Elis Kolchin <ref> [Kol73] </ref> est pratiquement tout entier consacre a ce theoreme. Il donne l'expose le plus recent et le plus global des preuves apportees par Howard Levi, pour la necessite, et A. Hillman, pour la suffisance. En effet, en 1942 Howard Levi [Lev42] apporte la premiere pierre pour algebriser la preuve. <p> Note that if p is such a homogeneous differential polynomial then any of its derivatives is a homogeneous differential polynomial of the same degree. Furthermore, RfY g is a graded algebra according to the degree <ref> [Kol73, I.7] </ref>. If D k is the set of homogeneous differential polynomials of degree k we have a direct sum decomposition RfY g = k2N It is possible to define a wider class of gradings of the ring RfY g among which the weight. <p> If p is an isobaric differential polynomial of weight k then p is an isobaric differential polynomial of weight k + ord , for any derivation operator 2 fi. If W k is the set of isobaric differential polynomials of weight k, we have a direct sum decomposition <ref> [Kol73, I.7] </ref> RfY g = k2N We shall also speak of differential monomials in a single differential indeterminate, say y n . <p> Note that con versely, fy 2 0 ; (y 1 ) 2 ; (y 2 ) 2 ; g = fy 2 E.2.3 Definition: A differential ring (R; ) is said to be Noetherian with re spect to its radical differential ideals if it satisfies one of the equivalent properties <ref> [Kol73, 0.9] </ref> any radical differential ideal R of R is finitely generated: there exists a finite set of elements of R such that R = fg. every strictly increasing sequence of radical differential ideals, according to the inclusion, is finite. every non-empty set of radical differential ideals has a maximal element <p> E.2.4 Theorem: A necessary and sufficient condition for (RfY g; ) to be Noethe rian with respect to its radical differential ideals is that (R; ) is itself Noetherian with respect to its radical differential ideals. The proof can be found in [Rit66, I.12 ], <ref> [Kol73, III.4] </ref>. We assume from now on and for the whole of this memoir that we have chosen a ground ring R which is Noetherian with respect to its radical differential ideals . <p> The reader can also refer to <ref> [Kol73, I.8] </ref> for a more detailed treatment of what follows. A differential polynomial q is partially reduced w.r.t. p if no proper derivatives of u p appears in q. If q is not partially reduced, let u p be the highest ranking derivative of u p present in q. <p> A, such that h q j q mod [A]: (1) Computing q and h consists in a well organized sequence of partial reductions and reductions by the differential polynomials of A <ref> [Kol73, I.9] </ref>. We write q! A q and we generalize the procedure d-rem to take as entry a differential polynomial q and an auto-reduced set A and to return the differential polynomial q reduced w.r.t. A satisfying (1). <p> Or, equivalently, among every non-empty set of auto-reduced subsets of F fY g there exists an auto-reduced set of lowest rank. This non-trivial result is proved in <ref> [Kol73, I.10] </ref>. It is a crucial point in many proofs of termination of algorithms and in the following definition. F.1.3 Definition: Let be an non-empty subset of F fY g. <p> It is in fact necessary and sufficient to check the condition on the minimal common derivatives <ref> [Kol73, IV.9] </ref>. We call s-dpoly the procedure which returns s a 0 a s a 0 a 0 when given two differential polynomials a and a 0 admitting v = u a = 0 u a 0 as minimal common derivative. It returns zero otherwise. <p> That A is coherent is only a sufficient condition: there exist auto-reduced sets which satisfy the above property though they are not coherent (see the example of [Bou96, section 5] ). Nonetheless, when dealing with prime differential ideals this becomes a necessary and sufficient condition <ref> [Kol73, IV.9, lemma 2] </ref>. F.2.5 Corollary: A is a characteristic set of a prime differential ideal of F fY g if and only if A is a coherent auto-reduced subset and A is a characteristic set of a prime ideal in F [fi A Y ]. <p> The properties of this radical differential ideal can be studied through the following lemma <ref> [Kol73, I.11] </ref> which is similar to Rosenfeld lemma: G.1.1 Lemma: If q 2 [p] : s 1 p and v denotes the highest derivative of u p present in p q then q 2 (fi v p) : s 1 p . <p> Nonetheless, the Component theorem <ref> [Kol73, IV.14] </ref> ensures a specific structure to the minimal decomposition of fpg. G.1.8 Theorem: Let p be a nonzero differential polynomial in F fY g. <p> A.Hillman uses this process in a more algebraic way to show the Leading coefficient theorem [HM62] . E.Kolchin's presentation uses this latter theorem for the necessity proof. He introduces the notion of domination, which allows to generalize Levi's lemma, to prove the sufficiency <ref> [Kol73, IV] </ref>.

For a derivative z we note m z the product of all the factors of m which are derivatives of z. <p> J.2.2 Definition: Let m and m 0 be two monomials in some differential polynomial ring Rfzg. m 0 dominates m if for any derivative z either deg m z &lt; deg m 0 or z A light version of the Domination lemma <ref> [Kol73, IV.12, Lemma 6] </ref> can then be stated as follow.

Reference-contexts: De plus, le go^ut algebrique de ce critere semble en complete contradiction avec la nature de la premiere demonstration proposee par Joseph Fels Ritt dans son papier de 1936 <ref> [Rit36] </ref>. En effet la demonstration de la suffisance y etait aborde par des transformations de Painleve, une technique d'analyse pour l'etude des singularites. Quant a la necessite, il est assez amusant de voir qu'elle repose, en quelque sorte, sur la defi nition que Lagrange donnait des solutions singulieres. <p> Joseph Fels Ritt a lui-m^eme apporte une reponse longue et difficile pour les equations du second ordre dans la deuxieme partie de l'article ou etait presente pour la premiere fois le Theoreme des Petites Puissances <ref> [Rit36] </ref>. <p> The criterion lies on the degree of the differential polynomial p. It is beautifully simple and algorithmic in essence. It is quite amazing that the early intuitions of the French school can be formulated in such an algebraic way. Even more surprising is that Ritt's early proof <ref> [Rit36] </ref>, for ordinary differential polynomial in one differential indeterminate, would use essentially complex analysis tools, such as a Painleve transformation. As Ritt put it "this would suggest a search for analogies between critical point problem and the problem of singular solutions". <p> Nonetheless, ae and the set of monomials m 0 fl depends only on p and a [Hil43]. G.3 The Low power theorem The Low power theorem is one of the most sophisticated theorem in differential algebra. J.F.Ritt first showed the theorem for ordinary algebraic differential equations in <ref> [Rit36] </ref>. The sufficiency would use "a transformation belonging to the class of differential equations whose solutions have fixed critical points". H. Levi brought a purely algebraic proof based on the study of the ideal [z p ] ([Lev42] and [Lev45] for partial differential equations). Besides, the original necessity proof [Rit36] requires <p> in <ref> [Rit36] </ref>.

Besides, the original necessity proof [Rit36] requires the construction of a solution into power series of a constant according to a polygon process. A.Hillman uses this process in a more algebraic way to show the Leading coefficient theorem [HM62] . E.Kolchin's presentation uses this latter theorem for the necessity proof. <p> Ritt has solved the problem of determining if the general component was included in a given singular component <ref> [Rit36] </ref>.
