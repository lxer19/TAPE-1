Abstract: A long-standing conjecture has been that ill-conditioned multivariable plants pose inherent design difficulty in achieving robust performance. The elusiveness of a proof of this conjecture has motivated study of an alternate design problem, involving only the nominal plant, in the hopes that an inherent difficulty due to plant conditioning might emerge for this alternate problem. In this note we show, under mild assumptions, that such a difficulty, if it indeed exists, must take the form of a design tradeoff between systems properties at different frequencies, rather than between properties at the same frequency. (The terminology "analytic" and "algebraic" is motivated by the type of mathematics used to describe each class of tradeoff.) This analysis is also interpreted as implying the same conclusion for the original robust performance problem.

Reference-contexts: In particular, each of these six transfer functions expresses the response of the system to an exogenous input and provides a stability margin against a class of modelling errors (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). It is also known that a given set of such design specifications may not be achievable, due to inherent performance limitations and tradeoffs that arise in feedback design. <p> For the present purpose, it suffices to note that robust performance is present if and only if the structured singular value <ref> [3] </ref> satisfies [M (j!)] &lt; 1 ; 8! ; (4:1) where M = r 1 T I r 1 P 1 T O # (See, e.g. [8]-[9] for details.) Here r 1 and r 2 are weighting functions having the general shape shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that an injudicious choice of compensator can yield a design which is extremely sensitive to small modelling errors; however, a definitive analysis of the design limitations has been hard to accomplish. The difficulty in studying the robust performance problem has motivated Nett <ref> [12] </ref> to study an alternate design problem involving only the nominal system. The idea is that by requiring bounds upon several closed loop transfer functions, an inherent limitation due to plant ill-conditioning might arise. The analysis in [12] is only partial, however. <p> The difficulty in studying the robust performance problem has motivated Nett <ref> [12] </ref> to study an alternate design problem involving only the nominal system.
