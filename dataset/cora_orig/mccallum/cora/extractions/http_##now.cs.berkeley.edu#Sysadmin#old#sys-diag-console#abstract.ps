Abstract: Our system diagnostic console will make it possible to scale network and host performance monitoring to hundreds of nodes through aggregation of information. It will support network and node testing so that problems can be diagnosed. The system is being implemented in Perl/Tk, and will be freely available. The Networks of Workstations [NOW] project is researching new ways to get faster services using hundreds of cooperating workstations. We therefore need improved diagnostic tools since simply monitoring a few main servers will not be sufficient. In general, problems occur in systems because of network congestion, node overloading, and temporary failures. To diagnose these problems, administrators need to see many components of a system. Administrators also need to be able to test parts of the system to verify they are functioning correctly. We need testing to help debug our very high-speed switched network. Most of our system is standard. Our research group has about 140 Sun workstations in our machine room and about 30 HP/715 workstations on the desktop. Our campus backbone is 100 Mbit FDDI, and our buildings network is a few shared 10 Mbit ethernets, with some switched 10 Mbit ethernet in the machine room. We also have an experimental switched network called Myrinet[Myri96] which has 640 Mbit bidirectional links and very simple switches. Myrinet switches only look at the prefix of the packet, which contains an output port specified by the sending host. Although this keeps the switches fast, simple, and inexpensive, it means that conventional mechanisms like SNMP[Case90] are not available. Therefore, we are investigating other solutions for diagnosing and testing the network. Figure 1 shows an example view of the System Diagnostic Console displaying our computers and networks. Our primary goal in designing a System Diag FIGURE An example view of the Diagnostic Console. We increase the information displayed by using fill, shading, and color as described in Table 1. Typically, thicker lines or more area filled indicates higher usage. Darker shading indicates more variation. Objects with halos represent groups, and can be expanded by clicking. The administrator has put the cursor over the FDDI link, causing detailed information to appear in the information window in the upper right hand corner. The administrator is also running a network test that is almost complete, as shown by the dashed lines across the bottom. The italic captions are for the explanation, and would not normally be displayed. FDDI Backbone 90/100 Mbits u3: 65 Mbits u17: 20 Mbits err/s nostic Console has been to maximize the information

Reference-contexts: The user can control the node statistic display through a icon-specific popup menu. The primary remaining piece of work is integrating testing. We expect to have this working very soon. 4.0 Related Work The most closely related work is TkIned <ref> [Sch93] </ref>. TkIned displays icons for each of the different nodes, and can display SNMP controlled stripcharts for values retrieved from those nodes. It does not handle aggregation of display information, or integrated node and network testing.
