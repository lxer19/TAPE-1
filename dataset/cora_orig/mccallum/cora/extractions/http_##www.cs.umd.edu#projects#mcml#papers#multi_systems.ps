Abstract: We present efficient schemes for scheduling the delivery of VBR MPEG-compressed video with stringent QoS requirements. Video scheduling is being used to improve bandwidth allocation at a video server that uses statistical multiplexing to aggregate video streams prior to transporting them over a network. A video stream is modeled using a traffic envelop that provides a deterministic time-varying bound on the bit rate. Because of the periodicity in which frame types in an MPEG stream are typically generated, a simple traffic envelop can be constructed using only five parameters. Using the traffic-envelop model, we show that video sources can be statistically multiplexed with an effective bandwidth that is often less than the source peak rate. Bandwidth gain is achieved without sacrificing the stringency of the requested QoS. The effective bandwidth depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams, which is a measure of the lag between the GOP periods of various streams. For homogeneous streams, we give an optimal scheduling scheme for video sources at a VOD server that results in the minimum effective bandwidth. We give the form of the "best" arrangement for which the scheduling is optimal. For heterogeneous sources, a sub-optimal scheduling scheme is given which achieves acceptable bandwidth gain. Numerical examples based on traces of MPEG-coded movies are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes.

Reference-contexts: For real-time applications (e.g., teleconferencing), temporal averaging is done using a FIFO buffer, which video frames are sent to just after their compression [10, 6, 13]. This approach introduces variable delay that is caused by buffering. For stored video, temporal averaging can be done by a work-ahead approach <ref> [1, 11, 17] </ref> in which frames are sent ahead of their playback time. A smoothing algorithm that attempts to minimize some function of the bit-rate variation is used to determine an appropriate transmission schedule for a video stream.

Reference-contexts: Although ATM networks are expected to provide a VBR network service <ref> [2] </ref>, it is unlikely that such a service will support deterministic quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. In this paper, we present efficient bandwidth allocation schemes for VBR video with stringent deterministic QoS (e.g., no cell losses and small, bounded delay).

Reference-contexts: Allocation efficiency is measured by the effective bandwidth per stream, or equivalently, the maximum number of connections that can be simultaneously transported using some fixed total bandwidth. To provide deterministic guarantees, only constant-bit-rate (CBR) or piecewise-CBR (renegotiated ) <ref> [4] </ref> network services can be used to transport the VBR traffic from a video server. Efficient bandwidth allocation for VBR traffic transported using a CBR or a piecewise-CBR network service requires reducing the variability of the bit rate.

Reference-contexts: We quantify the attainable bandwidth gain using the notion of effective bandwidth. This notion, also known as equivalent capacity, was investigated in several previous studies within a stochastic framework <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, the effective bandwidth is defined within a deterministic framework to guarantee zero cell loss rate and negligible queueing delays. Consider N MPEG streams, s 1 ; : : : ; s N , with stringent deterministic QoS requirements to be transported over an ATM network.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, we model an MPEG source using a traffic envelop which provides a deterministic upper bound on the bit rate. The use of traffic envelops to characterize MPEG video sources was first mentioned in <ref> [7] </ref>. By exploiting the periodic manner in which various types of frames are generated by an MPEG encoder, we provide a simple time-varying traffic envelop that is less conservative than a constant-peak-rate characterization. <p> is possible to have L = Q = 1, in which case only I frames are generated (i.e., JPEG-like stream). 3 To provide deterministic guarantees for video traffic, we characterize a video stream by a traffic envelop that is similar, to some extent, 1 to the D-BIND model introduced in <ref> [7] </ref>. In our model, a stream consists of a sequence of compressed frames generated at a constant frame rate according to a regular GOP pattern. <p> A similar updating procedure is also used when a connection is terminated. 6 Numerical Results We tested the efficiency of our scheduling schemes on real MPEG traces that were captured by several researchers <ref> [3, 7, 8, 16] </ref> for various types of video, including action movies, advertisements, and a lecture.

Reference-contexts: Sizes of I frames (similarly, P and B frames) within one scene are close in value. Since on the average a scene lasts for several seconds <ref> [9] </ref>, changing the compression pattern (whose time scale is smaller than one second) has little effect on the maximum sizes of I , P , and B frames within a scene.
