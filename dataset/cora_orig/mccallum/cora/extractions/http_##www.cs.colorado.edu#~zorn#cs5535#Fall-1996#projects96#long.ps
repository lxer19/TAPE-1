Title: DALEGO Composite Applications Application Agent, Java program  Course Project  
Author: Amy Junhong Long Instructor: Ben Zorn 
Date: 5535 Fall 1996  
Pubnum: CSCI  
Abstract: A large number of software applications have been developed in the past, most with single task capabilities. These applications now have demands on them however, which are more complex, or have more functionalities than they can provide for. Compositing existing applications into one powerful and convenient application is a solution. Placing an agent in charge of an existing application, and a manager in charge of all the agents, is a good structure of compositing. Interapplication communication is the key to this structure. A uniform interface between the manager and it's agents, and a standard interface between an agent and it's client application, is also necessary. A portable programming language is preferred to develop the manager and it's agents. An evaluation of Java concludes that it is a feasible language to program a composite application for writing an html file. But due to the lack of effective means of interapplication communications, Java may become very difficult to build a composite application for other purposes.

Reference-contexts: Visual Basic implements a shared Data Structure interapplication communication method, Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). DDE communicates to the other applications what information to put into, or take out of, the clipboard ( a shared memory). The method in which DDE works <ref> [VB 4] </ref> is that one Windows application (called the client) tells another Windows application (called the server) that it requires information. <p> A cold link means that the client must explicitly request updates. A notification link is one in which the server tells the client that data has changed, but it would not be written to the shared memory until the client requests it. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) <ref> [VB 4] </ref> is also implemented in Visual Basic. It originally was a technology that complimented and extended DDE by allowing applications to link to a common object which resides on a shared memory (create a reference to the shared object).

Reference-contexts: This technology can also be used to allow a language to implement mechanisms which enables interactive application communications. Tcl, a tool command language, consists of a library package that programs can use as the basis for their command language <ref> [TCL 89] </ref>. Tcl is really intended to be embedded in application programs. It can provide a means of communication between applications, if the applications in a given environment are based on the same language.

Reference-contexts: Can Java be used to program a composite application, such as wpmaker? JAVA AND WPMAKER JAVA LANGUAGE Java is a portable language which enables us to make use of almost all the existing applications. Runtime.getRuntime ( ).exec ( cmd, envp ) method is available to invoke the existing application <ref> [JLIB 96] </ref>. Here cmd and envp are an array of String data type, cmd is the name of the existing program and it's parameters, and envp is the specifications of the environment the existing program runs on. A minimum of interapplication communication can then be achieved through Java.

Reference-contexts: Java's applet package enables the wpmaker to be invoked from netscape, which offers a great convenience for the user to create their own home page using wpmaker. Java's dynamic facilities allows for the creation of classes at run time <ref> [JAPI 96] </ref>. Java's programmer-defined layout manager can be created by implementing the LayoutManager interface [JHP 97]; plus it allows for resizing of an image. It could give a web page the flexible layout the user desires.
