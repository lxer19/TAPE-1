Title: A SPECTRAL ALGORITHM FOR SERIATION AND THE CONSECUTIVE ONES PROBLEM  
Author: JONATHAN E. ATKINS ERIK G. BOMAN AND BRUCE HENDRICKSON 
Keyword: Key words. seriation, consecutive ones property, eigenvector, Fiedler vector, analysis of algorithms  
Abstract: In applications ranging from DNA sequencing through archaeological dating to sparse matrix reordering, a recurrent problem is the sequencing of elements in such a way that highly correlated pairs of elements are near each other. That is, given a correlation function f reflecting the desire for each pair of elements to be near each other, find all permutations with the property that if (i) &lt; (j) &lt; (k) then f(i; j) f (i; k) and f(j; k) f(i; k). This seriation problem is a generalization of the well studied consecutive ones problem. We present a spectral algorithm for this problem that has a number of interesting features. Whereas most previous applications of spectral techniques provide only bounds or heuristics, our result is an algorithm that correctly solves a nontrivial combinatorial problem. In addition, spectral methods are being successfully applied as heuristics to a variety of sequencing problems, and our result helps explain and justify these applications.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes another such application. Spectral methods are closely related to the more general method of semidefinite programming, which has been applied successfully to many combinatorial problems (e.g. MAX-CUT and MAX-2SAT [14] and graph coloring [18]). See Alizadeh <ref> [1] </ref> for a survey of semidefinite programming with applications to combinatorial optimization. Our result is important for several reasons. First, it provides new insight into the well-studied consecutive ones problem. <p> Its proof requires detailed algebra, but it is not fundamental to what follows. Consequently, the proof is relegated to the end of this section. Lemma 4.4. Let A be an irreducible n fi n R-matrix with a n;1 = 0. If J = [r; s] 6= <ref> [1; n] </ref> is an interval such that a r;k = a s;k for all k =2 J , then x r = x r+1 = : : : = x s for any Fiedler vector x. Lemma 4.5. <p> Proof. First apply Lemma 4.3 to conclude that for any k =2 J ; a r;k = a r+1;k = : : : = a s;k . Since x T e = 0, it follows that J 6= <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Now use this in conjunction with Lemma 4.4 to obtain the result. Theorem 4.6. If A is an irreducible R-matrix with a n;1 = 0, then the Fiedler value 2 is a simple eigenvalue. Proof. We will assume that 2 is a repeated eigenvalue and produce a contradiction.

However, when we encounter ties in entries of the Fiedler vector, we need to recurse on the subproblem encompassing the tied values.

Reference-contexts: Unlike traditional combinatorial methods, our approach uses an eigenvector of a matrix to order the elements. Our main result is that this approach correctly solves an important ordering problem we call the seriation problem which includes the well known consecutive ones problem <ref> [5] </ref> as a special case. More formally, we are given a set of n elements to sequence; that is, we wish to bijectively map the elements to the integers 1; : : : ; n. <p> Although there may be an exponential number of such orderings, they can all be described in a compact data structure known as a PQ-tree <ref> [5] </ref> which we review in the next section. Not all correlation functions allow for a consistent sequencing. If a consistent ordering is possible we will say the problem is well posed. <p> We will be notationally cavalier and refer to the Fiedler value and vector of A when we really mean those of L A . 2.2. PQ-trees. A PQ-tree is a data structure introduced by Booth and Lueker to efficiently encode a set of related permutations <ref> [5] </ref>. A PQ-tree over a set U = fu 1 ; u 2 ; : : : ; u n g is a rooted, ordered tree whose leaves are elements of U and whose internal nodes are distinguished as either P-nodes or Q-nodes. <p> If the result is a P-matrix then all the permutations produce C1P orderings. If not, then C has no C1P orderings. The run time for this technique is not competitive with the linear time algorithm for this problem due to Booth and Lueker <ref> [5] </ref>. However, unlike their approach, our Spectral-Sort algorithm does not break down in the presence of errors and can instead serve as a heuristic. Several other combinatorial problems have been shown to be equivalent to the consecutive ones problem. <p> However, unlike their approach, our Spectral-Sort algorithm does not break down in the presence of errors and can instead serve as a heuristic.

Reference-contexts: For example, if biological experiments were error-free, the genomic reconstruction problem would be precisely C1P. Unfortunately, real experimental data always contain errors, and attempts to generalize the consecutive ones concept to data with errors seems to invariably lead to NP-complete problems <ref> [31, 15] </ref>. A spectral heuristic based upon our approach has recently been applied to such problems and found to be highly successful in practice [15].

Reference-contexts: Laplacian eigenvectors were first studied by Fiedler [10, 11] and independently by Donath and Hoffman [9]. More recently, there have been a number of attempts to apply spectral graph theory to problems in combinatorial optimization. For example, spectral algorithms have been developed for graph coloring [3], graph partitioning <ref> [9, 28] </ref> and envelope reduction [4], and more examples can be found in the survey papers of Mohar [23, 24]. However, in most previous applications, these techniques have been used to provide bounds, heuristics, or in a few cases, approximation algorithms [2, 6, 14] for NP-hard problems.

Reference-contexts: For example, if biological experiments were error-free, the genomic reconstruction problem would be precisely C1P. Unfortunately, real experimental data always contain errors, and attempts to generalize the consecutive ones concept to data with errors seems to invariably lead to NP-complete problems <ref> [31, 15] </ref>. A spectral heuristic based upon our approach has recently been applied to such problems and found to be highly successful in practice [15]. Our result helps explain this empirical success by revealing that in the error-free case the technique will correctly solve the problem.

Reference-contexts: Among these are recognizing interval graphs [5, 12] and finding dense envelope orderings of matrices [5]. One generalization of P-matrices is to matrices with unimodal columns (a unimodal sequence is a sequence that is non-decreasing until it reaches its maximum, then non-increasing). These matrices are called unimodal matrices <ref> [32] </ref>.
