Title: The ParaScope Editor: User Interface Goals  
Author: Kathi Fletcher Ken Kennedy Kathryn McKinley Scott Warren 
Abstract: This paper describes a new, more unified user interface design for the ParaScope Editor, an exploratory parallel programming tool being developed in the ParaScope programming environment. It discusses in detail the work model it is intended to support, and how program information is to be presented to users.

Reference-contexts: Dependences are however easily returned for reconsideration by either. Also, dependence classification and variable classification currently use two distinct mechanisms. The complete functionality and user interface of the existing version of the ParaScope Editor (Ped) are described elsewhere <ref> [BKK + 89, KMT91] </ref>. This document describes a new, unified user interface design which will facilitate the parallel programming process in the ParaScope Editor. In particular, this document proposes a unified work model for the classification of dependences and variables.
