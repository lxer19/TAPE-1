Abstract: Information-rich environments are the open environments that characterize most of the modern applications of computing technology. The applications include ubiquitous information access, electronic commerce, virtual enterprises, logistics, and sensor integration, to name but a few. These applications differ from conventional database applications not only in the nature and variety of information they involve, but also in including a significant component that is beyond the information system per se: the creation, transformation, use, and ultimate fate of information. The environments are typified only by the large amounts and varieties of information they include, and whose effective and efficient management is key to the above applications. Multiagent systems (MAS) are an important paradigm for building complex information systems, especially cooperative ones. We describe how cooperative information system architectures have evolved a set of common types of computational agents. We also describe two approaches that address complementary aspects of MAS construction.

Reference-contexts: A better understanding of processes, especially as they apply in open environments, is a 3 prerequisite for the integration of the dynamic aspects. There has been some re-lated work in software engineering <ref> [2] </ref>, but it is mostly geared to single processes, not their interaction. This paper discusses the results we have obtained along the above two lines of thought. 1.3 Organization Section 2 describes some components of an architecture of a multiagent system for information-rich environments.

Reference-contexts: Agents can join a SoCom when configured by humans or during execution: this requires publishing the definition of the abstract SoCom. 5 Designing Commitments We consider an example in two parts. The first deals with electronic commerce; the second combines in aspects of virtual enterprises <ref> [7] </ref>. The commitments are designed based on the corresponding roles in human society. 11 5.1 Electronic Commerce We first define an abstract SoCom consisting of two roles: buyer and seller, which require capabilities and commitments about, e.g., the requests they will honor, and the validity of price quotes.

Reference-contexts: Ontologies are suitable for graphical representation, and can be scaled and viewed at various levels of abstraction, thereby making them suitable for large information spaces. As an example of the tools we have been developing for exploiting the benefits of ontologies is the Java Ontology Editor, JOE <ref> [8] </ref>. JOE provides a graphical user interface for users to (1) browse and edit ontologies, or (2) construct queries based on the ontologies.

Reference-contexts: Mediators thus shield the different components of the system from each other. To construct mediators effectively requires some common representation of the meanings of the resources and applications they connect. Such a representation is called an ontology <ref> [9] </ref>, and it is often managed by its own specialized agent. It is a sign of their maturity that cooperative information systems are beginning to evolve a standard set of agent types.

Reference-contexts: Although suitable for traditional data processing, for the above rea-sons, traditional commitments are highly undesirable for information-rich environments, where autonomous entities must carry out prolonged interactions with one another <ref> [11] </ref>. Commitments reflect an inherent tension between predictability and flexibility. Agents who can commit are easier to deal with. Also, the desired commitments serve as a sort of requirements on the construction of the agents who meet those commitments.

Reference-contexts: An example area would be contracting among autonomous entities, which seems to underlie several of the upcoming open applications. Along with richer metamodels, there is need for a corresponding intuitive semantics. We have made some progress along this direction <ref> [12] </ref>. One of the themes that should be more intensively addressed is the compositionality of conceptual models. For example, one would like to build separate models for electronic commerce and virtual enterprises, and dynamically compose them to produce a model for a commercially engaged virtual enterprise.

Reference-contexts: We distinguish social or communicative interactions from incidental interactions that agents may have as a consequence of existing in a shared environment. Independently, Wegner has also argued that interaction is a key extension beyond traditional computer science <ref> [14] </ref>. 1.1 Information-Rich Environments Information-rich environments have been around for a long time. We previously defined them in broad terms as environments consisting of a large number and variety of distributed and heterogeneous information sources [5]. The associated applications are varied.

Reference-contexts: The semantic services provided the basis for agent interoperation, letting the agents use models of each other's resources in interacting in a desirable manner. This is similar in some respects to the concept of mediators <ref> [15] </ref>. The distribution services managed logical data access for both retrieval and updates. They included tools such a common interpretive execution environment as well as a distributed communicating agent facility. <p> Section 5 applies these notions to formalize applications in electronic commerce and virtual enterprises. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of future directions. 2 Architecture A promising approach is to the challenges of interoperability is to use mediators <ref> [15] </ref>. A mediator is a simplified agent that acts on behalf of a set of information resources or applications. Figure 1 shows a mediator architecture. The basic idea is that the mediator is responsible for mapping the resources or applications to the rest of the world.
