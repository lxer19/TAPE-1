Abstract: ing Probabilistic Actions Abstract This paper discusses the problem of abstracting conditional probabilistic actions. We identify two distinct types of abstraction: intra-action abstraction and inter-action abstraction. We define what it means for the abstraction of an action to be correct and then derive two methods of intra-action abstraction and two methods of inter-action abstraction which are correct according to this criterion. We illustrate the developed techniques by applying them to actions described with the temporal action representation used in the drips decision-theoretic planner and we describe how the planner uses abstraction to reduce the complexity of planning.

Reference-contexts: the conjunction with any sentence that entails it and we can replace the disjunction with any sentence entailed by it. 4 Applying the Techniques In this section we present some examples of applying the abstraction methods to actions described in the representation language of the drips decision-theoretic refinement planning system <ref> [ Haddawy and Suwandi, 1994 ] </ref> . The drips system uses abstraction to reduce the complexity of planning by eliminating suboptimal abstract plans. 4.1 The drips Representation The drips system reasons with a probabilistic temporal world model.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the conditions labeling the branches are probabilistically independent of the action. This is reasonable since the conditions are conditions on the state of the world prior to performing the action. This representation is similar to that used by Hanks <ref> [ Hanks, 1990b, Hanks, 1990a ] </ref> . 2.2 Projecting Actions Decision-theoretic planning can be conceptually divided into two operations: generation of alternative plans and computation of the expected utilities of the generated plans.

Reference-contexts: Action a has been abstracted by first grouping branches e 2 and e 3 and then grouping the branches (e 1 ; e 4 ), ((e 2 ; e 3 ); e 5 ), and (e 6 ; e 7 ). 3.2 Inter-Action Abstraction We extend Tenenberg's <ref> [ Tenenberg, 1991 ] </ref> notion of inheritance abstraction for STRIPS operators to apply to conditional probabilistic actions.
