Title: Wavelet Solutions for the Dirichlet Problem  
Author: Raymond O. Wells, Jr. Xiaodong Zhou

Date: October 13, 1993  
Abstract: A modified classical penalty method for solving a Dirichlet boundary value problem is presented. This new fictitious domain/penalty method eliminates the traditional need of generating a complex computation grid in the case of irregular domain. It is based on the fact that one can expand the boundary measure under the chosen basis which leads to a fast, approximate calculation of boundary integral. The compact support and orthonormality of the basis are essential for representing the boundary measure numerically, and therefore for implementing this methodology.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Compactly supported wavelets which are differentiable were introduced by Daubechies in her celebrated paper <ref> [2] </ref>, which has had applications in a number of areas. Since these functions combine orthogonality with localization and scaling properties it has been a natural idea to attempt to use these functions for the numerical approximation to solutions to partial differential equations.

Reference-contexts: This process is carried out in this paper using Daubechies wavelets with 6 coefficients (which are barely first-order differentiable), and for a particular weak formulation, based on a penalty method, as in <ref> [6] </ref>, Appendix 1. It works quite well as we see in both the convergence proofs presented below as well as in the confirming numerical experiments. <p> Here we propose a formulation which enables us to work with a regular mesh grid. More specifically, we solve a penalty problem <ref> [6] </ref> in a slightly larger, but simply shaped (rectangular in general) domain . Let be a square containing !. <p> Here ~ f is an arbitrary L 2 extension of f to . Clearly, u * exists for every * &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: However, under the finite element basis, the approximation of boundary measure (see Section 3.2) is not as good as the one in terms of wavelet basis, one possible reason may be that finite element basis is not orthonormal. See <ref> [8] </ref> for relative discussions, and a comparison of wavelet and finite element methods. 4 In this paper we formulate all of the theoretical results in two dimensions, although we could easily have expressed them in arbitrary dimensions.
