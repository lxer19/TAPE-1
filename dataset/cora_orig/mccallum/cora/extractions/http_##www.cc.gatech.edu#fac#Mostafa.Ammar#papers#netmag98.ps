Abstract: Multicast (multipoint) distribution of video is an important component of many existing and future networked services. Today's Internet lacks support for quality of service (QoS) assurance which makes the transmission of real-time traffic (such as video) challenging. In addition, the heterogeneity of the Internet's transmission resources and end-systems makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to agree on acceptable traffic characterization among multiple receivers of the same video stream. In this paper we survey techniques that have been proposed for transmitting video in this environment. These techniques generally involve adaptation of the video traffic carried over the network to match receiver requirements and network conditions. In addition to their applicability to the near-term capabilities of the Internet, they also are of relevance to a future, QoS-aware Internet environment because of the inevitable inaccuracies in traffic and resource reservation specifications. We first consider source-based techniques in which the source adjusts the video stream traffic to match some consensus among the receivers about its desired characteristics. These techniques can result in an unfair treatment for receivers especially those whose capability is significantly above or below the group consensus. We then consider techniques that aim to improve the fairness among the receivers by sending the video in multiple (layered or replicated) streams. We also discuss several error control mechanisms, using timely retransmission of missing data to further improve the quality of the received video. Finally, we discuss some of the issues that remain to be resolved in the development of Internet video multicast protocols.

Reference-contexts: Multicast video distribution over the Internet requires 1) support mechanisms for multicast data delivery and 2) the ability to accommodate the real-time requirements of digital video. The provision of multicast data delivery within the Internet has been the subject of significant research and deployment efforts recently <ref> [1] </ref>. We later summarize the features of this support fl This work has been supported in part by research grants from Lucent, Intel, IBM, and the National Science Foundation grant NCR-96283793. 1 relevant to our discussion here.

Reference-contexts: There are two general approaches that can be used: * incorporating quality-of-service support within the Internet to allow video distribution applications to be able to reserve resources and establish bounds on data delivery delay, delay jitter and data loss <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. * using adaptive rate control techniques to adjust the video traffic characteristics according to the available Internet resources. We are concerned, in this paper, with the protocols that implement the second approach. Such protocols are of significance because they are compatible with the near-term capabilities of the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The effect of losses can also be overcome through the use of error control techniques. These techniques resemble ones used in the reliable multicasting of files or web-pages (see for example, <ref> [7, 8] </ref>). Reliable multicasting of continuous media, such as real-time audio/video is significantly different from reliable multicasting of files. Reliability for file distribution means an absolute reliable delivery of files. On the other hand, reliability for continuous media means an improvement over best-effort delivery. <p> Use a statically configured logical tree at the transport layer with Designated Receivers (DRs) at each level of the tree to help with retransmission of lost packets. This technique is similar to the one employed by RMTP <ref> [7] </ref>. 2. Improve efficiency by not asking for retransmissions of those packets which cannot be recov ered in time. This reduces control traffic and also retransmission traffic. 3. Improve response time by sending immediate NAKs and multicasting retransmissions. 4. <p> This is shown in Part (a) of Figure 15. The key to solving this problem is to reduce the recovery time for the lost packets by using an entity closer to the receiver for retransmissions. This entity is the designated receiver (DR) <ref> [7] </ref> in a tree-based hierarchical framework (Figure 16).

Reference-contexts: Should one let the receiver with the least capacity dictate the adaptation? This is clearly unacceptable in most circumstances. Ignoring such a receiver can also lead to problems. As a guiding principle in the design of multicast video distribution protocols we adopt a fairness ideal that states <ref> [9] </ref>: Ideally, each receiver should receive video that is commensurate with its own capability and the capability of the path leading to it from the source, regardless of the capabilities of the other receivers. <p> next section is one way to operate a video multicast protocol that spans the middle region of this Unicast/Multicast spectrum. 5 Replicated-Stream Video Multicast In order to address the fairness issue in feedback-controlled multicast video distribution, Cheung, Ammar and Li designed and implemented a protocol called Destination Set Grouping (DSG) <ref> [9, 16] </ref>. 7 In DSG, as shown in Figure 4, the source keeps a small number of video streams carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed limits by its group of receivers.

Reference-contexts: The adjustment of the video data rate through adjustment of compression parameters is sometime called media scaling. The paper by Delgrossi et al <ref> [10] </ref>, reporting on video multicast within Heidelberg Transport System HeiTS, is perhaps one of the first instances of the use of media scaling in the context of multicast video transmission. The paper contains a good description of the different scaling options. <p> Shacham reviewed layered coding schemes, presented methods for finding maximum bandwidth available to the destinations, developed schemes to optimally assign bandwidth to the layers to maximize overall reception quality, and proposed error control procedures. This work has the assumption of admission control and resource reservation. The HeiTS media scaling <ref> [10] </ref> schemes include discrete scaling for multicast. The scheme is built on the same philosophy that receivers should receive a certain level of the multimedia layers commensurate to their bandwidth constraint.

The data part of RTP is an application-layer framing <ref> [12] </ref> protocol that provides support for applications with real-time properties (e.g., timing reconstruction, loss detection, security and content identification). The control part, called Realtime Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), monitors the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and provides minimal control and identification functionality.

Reference-contexts: next section is one way to operate a video multicast protocol that spans the middle region of this Unicast/Multicast spectrum. 5 Replicated-Stream Video Multicast In order to address the fairness issue in feedback-controlled multicast video distribution, Cheung, Ammar and Li designed and implemented a protocol called Destination Set Grouping (DSG) <ref> [9, 16] </ref>. 7 In DSG, as shown in Figure 4, the source keeps a small number of video streams carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed limits by its group of receivers. <p> Fairness among receivers is improved significantly over a single-group approach while incurring only a small additional bandwidth overhead. 5.3 Bandwidth Control for the DSG Protocol Carrying replicated streams on network links in the DSG protocol can result in congestion on those links. Li and Ammar proposed bandwidth control mechanisms <ref> [16] </ref> for DSG, in order to limit the overloading effects caused by network links carrying multiple streams. <p> Overall Bandwidth Limiting mechanisms provide macro control at the video source to attempt to limit the overall bandwidth of the multicast video session. Despite the techniques described in <ref> [16] </ref> for controlling the bandwidth used in the DSG protocol, this issue may remain somewhat problematic in some environments.

Reference-contexts: The rate control is receiver-initiated and each receiver opens or closes ST-II multicast connections to receive certain layers of the multicast stream. But the authors did not present how the receivers decide their appropriate reception layers. Based on IP multicast, Deering suggested a new approach for layered video multicast <ref> [22] </ref>: different video layers are sent in different multicast groups and receivers adapt to the appropriate 12 set of reception layers by joining or leaving the multicast group.

Reference-contexts: In the rest of this section, we will survey two rate control protocols in layered video multicast over IP networks. 6.2 Receiver-driven Layered Multicast (RLM) McCanne, Jacobson and Vetterli proposed the Receiver-driven Layered Multicast protocol (RLM) <ref> [23] </ref>, to support rate adaptation for layered video transmission over IP multicast. 6.2.1 Basic Rate Adaptation Schemes In RLM, the sender sends each video layer to a separate IP multicast group and takes no active role in rate adaptation. <p> Some of the results presented in <ref> [23] </ref> are summarized below. * Latency Scalability. When the link delay increases, the duration of join-experiments also grows as it takes longer to detect congestion. * Session Scalability. <p> The first contribution will be discussed in the next section, while here we concentrate on the HRC schemes. 6.3.1 Hierarchical Rate Control and Comparison with RLM In contrast to the existing sender-based and receiver-based <ref> [23] </ref> rate control in which the entire information about network congestion is either available at the sender (in the sender-based approach) or replicated at the receivers (in the receiver-based approach), the hierarchical rate control mechanism distributes the information between the sender, receivers, and some agents in the network in such a

Reference-contexts: The aggregated utilization on the shared link converges to close to one, but bandwidth allocation to each session is often unfair. 6.2.4 A Related Protocol: SCUBA Amir, McCanne and Katz proposed the SCUBA protocol <ref> [24] </ref> that enables a video source to intelligently account for receiver interest in their rate-adaptation algorithms. The basic idea is to reflect receiver interest back to the sources in a multicast session using a scalable control mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The two key contributions of the system are: (1) improving the quality of reception within each layer by retransmitting lost packets given an upper bound on recovery time and applying an adaptive playback point scheme to help achieve more successful retransmission <ref> [25] </ref>, and (2) adapting to network congestion and heterogeneity using Hierarchical 14 Rate Control (HRC) mechanisms [26]. <p> Distributed control schemes are used both at the receivers and the sender. The total number of layers/streams is decreased when there is less heterogeneity and increased otherwise. 7 Error Control In the context of video multicast there has been two approaches to error control: 1. Retransmission-based (ARQ) approach <ref> [25, 29, 30, 31] </ref> and 2. Hybrid FEC-ARQ approach [32, 33] In this section we will focus on the retransmission-based schemes since they have received the most attention in the literature. 7.1 Layered Video Multicast with Retransmission (LVMR) The key ideas in LVMR [25] are: 1. <p> Retransmission-based (ARQ) approach [25, 29, 30, 31] and 2. Hybrid FEC-ARQ approach [32, 33] In this section we will focus on the retransmission-based schemes since they have received the most attention in the literature. 7.1 Layered Video Multicast with Retransmission (LVMR) The key ideas in LVMR <ref> [25] </ref> are: 1. Use a statically configured logical tree at the transport layer with Designated Receivers (DRs) at each level of the tree to help with retransmission of lost packets. This technique is similar to the one employed by RMTP [7]. 2. <p> In addition, during congestion, the more important video layers have a longer time cushion for repair. This is the second type of adaptation of the playback point used in LVMR. More details can be found in <ref> [25] </ref>. 7.1.3 Experiments Several experiments were performed for LVMR over the Mbone to test how effective the extended control time, adaptive playback point and retransmission requesting schemes are. <p> Note also that the frame rate and the number of video layers received by a receiver affected the effective retransmission ratio. More experimental results may be found in <ref> [25] </ref>. 7.2 STORM While LVMR uses a statically configured logical tree at the transport layer, meaning that the receivers always bank on the same DRs for retransmissions, STORM [29] provides a mechanism for each receiver to dynamically select the best possible DR at any instant of time.

LVMR provides schemes to partition the comprehensive group knowledge base in an intelligent way <ref> [26] </ref>. In Hierarchical Rate Control schemes, LVMR proposes a hierarchy of affected regions to show the domain of receivers that can get affected when an add-layer experiment is performed. Within an affected region, LVMR provides heuristics to find which receivers can be congested by a failed add-layer experiment.

Reference-contexts: The results in Figure 14 show that when adding layers, Hierarchical Rate Control (1)decreases unnecessary add-layer experiment, and (2) provides smoother video quality. 6.4 Thin Streams Wu, Sharma and Smith proposed Thin Streams as a solution to the join/leave problem in layered video multicast <ref> [28] </ref>. Each video layer is divided into multiple thin streams of equal bandwidth, and each thin stream is multicast in a separate multicast group.

Reference-contexts: Distributed control schemes are used both at the receivers and the sender. The total number of layers/streams is decreased when there is less heterogeneity and increased otherwise. 7 Error Control In the context of video multicast there has been two approaches to error control: 1. Retransmission-based (ARQ) approach <ref> [25, 29, 30, 31] </ref> and 2. Hybrid FEC-ARQ approach [32, 33] In this section we will focus on the retransmission-based schemes since they have received the most attention in the literature. 7.1 Layered Video Multicast with Retransmission (LVMR) The key ideas in LVMR [25] are: 1. <p> More experimental results may be found in [25]. 7.2 STORM While LVMR uses a statically configured logical tree at the transport layer, meaning that the receivers always bank on the same DRs for retransmissions, STORM <ref> [29] </ref> provides a mechanism for each receiver to dynamically select the best possible DR at any instant of time. The key ideas in STORM are: 1. Use a dynamically changing logical tree at the transport layer to improve the probability of getting retransmissions in time. 2. <p> More details can be found in <ref> [29] </ref>. Adapting the structure The logical tree structure built by STORM changes over time as the network conditions change. For example, if some part of the network gets congested, a parent may fail to provide with timely recovery. <p> The Mbone experiment of STORM consisted of 8 sites, namely, Berkeley, UCLA, ISI, UMASS, CMU, Ga. Tech, University of Virginia and University of Kentucky. Only one result from the Mbone experiment of STORM is provided here (Table 2). More details can be found in <ref> [29] </ref>. The point to observe here is that the performance of STORM and SRM are comparable in most cases except for the sites with high initial loss rates (such as, University of Virginia), where STORM outperformed SRM by a large margin.

Separate the actual senders and receivers from a repair architecture consisting of a retransmit server Svr (located close to the sender) and several repair servers located in various locations of an intranet) as shown in Figure 18.

In LVMR, the playback point p 0 is extended by an additional amount ffi which is referred to as control time. That is, p 0 = t 0 + + ffi.

Reference-contexts: If pricing is used to provide an incentive system, then receiver behavior may be quite different and this can be used to influence the design of video multicast protocols. There is very limited work in this area. The study reported in <ref> [38] </ref> begins to address this question. The list above represents a set of very hard questions. However, the need to multicast video over the Internet is expected to intensify in the near future. Resolution of these and other issues (some discussed in the body of the paper) is, therefore, essential. 25
