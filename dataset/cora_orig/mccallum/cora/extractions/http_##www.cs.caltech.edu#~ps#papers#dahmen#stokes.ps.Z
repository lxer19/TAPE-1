Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate Galerkin schemes for the Stokes-equations based on a suitably adapted multiresolution analysis. In particular, it will be shown that techniques developed in connection with shift-invariant refin-able spaces give rise to trial spaces of any desired degree of accuracy satisfying the Ladysenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition for any spatial dimension. Moreover, in the time dependent case efficient preconditioners for the Schur complements of the discrete systems of equations can be based on corresponding stable multiscale decompositions. The results are illustrated by some concrete examples of adapted wavelets and corresponding numerical experiments.

Reference-contexts: A general construction of multiresolution spaces and their stable decompositions for essentially Lipschitz domains is proposed and analyzed in [8]. To focus on the essential ideas and to avoid the technicalities entailed by the general case we will confine the subsequent discussions to the simple model case = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n . In fact, the type of basis functions will be the same in the general case where, however, the boundary near modifications depend on the local behavior of the boundary. <p> Since our main concern here is the LBB condition we have decided not to address the general boundary adaptation here.

Thus one keeps possibly many shifts ~(2 j k) whose support is strictly inside [0; 1] as basis functions while modifying those interfering with the end points of the interval in such a way that overall one obtains stable biorthogonal basis functions which are still refinable and span all polynomials up to a desired degree. <p> On account of (3:3:3), it is clear that the functions ~ j;k ; k 2 K j;I , together with the functions ~ L j;k ; k 2 K j;L , ~ R j;k ; k 2 K j;R , span all polynomials of degree at most d 1 on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The functions ~ ~ L j;k ; ~ ~ R j;k are defined analogously with the roles of ~ and ~ ~ interchanged. <p> For simplicity, we confine ourselves here to reproduce thereby the same degree d 1 of exactness also for the dual side (see [17] for the general case). As in <ref> [1] </ref> one can verify that the ~ L j;k are linearly independent and refinable. It remains to biorthogonalize the sets ~ L j;k ; k 2 K j;L , and ~ R j;k ; k 2 K j;R , respectively. <p> j;k;m ~ R (3.3.9) satisfy ~ j;k ; ~ ~ j;m L 2 ([0;1]) Defining now ffi j := f~ j;k : k 2 K j g; ~ ffi j := f ~ ~ j;k : k 2 K j g; (3.3.11) the following facts can be verified (see also <ref> [1, 17] </ref>). Proposition 3.3 Under the above assumptions one has: (i) diam supp (~ j;k ) ~ 2 j ; k 2 K j ; #K j ~ 2 j . (ii) The ffi j are uniformly stable. 16 W. Dahmen, A. Kunoth and K. <p> Dahmen, A.

(iv) S (ffi j ) S (ffi j+1 ); j 2 IN; j j 0 : Analogous facts hold for ~ ffi j . <p> It remains to determine the corresponding biorthogonal wavelets adapted to the interval. Again one retains possibly many wavelets in the form (3:1:5) as long as their support lies strictly in (0; 1).

As mentioned above the wavelets with support in the interior of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> have the form (3.1.5).

The following result due to Fortin [19] (see also <ref> [3, 20] </ref>) offers a way to check the validity of (1:8). Proposition 1.1 Assume that the spaces ~ X and M satisfy the inf-sup condition (1:6). <p> More extensive numerical tests for the time dependent problem will be reported in a forthcoming paper. The saddle point problem (1:12) is solved here by the classical Uzawa algorithm using conjugate directions (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). We view this also as a preliminary step to employ next the alternatives described in [4]. The linear systems arising in the Uzawa iteration are treated by means of a BPX-type preconditioned cg-method [5] whose realization for the present situation is described in [22, 28].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During the past few years very efficient preconditioners for linear systems arising from Galerkin discretizations of scalar elliptic boundary value problems have become available <ref> [5, 16, 26, 32] </ref>. These techniques combined with conjugate gradient schemes achieve optimal multigrid complexity under minimal regularity assumptions. <p> Alternatively, the operators A j could be preconditioned with the aid of a BPX scheme <ref> [5] </ref>. We have mentioned the former possibility here since an analogous scheme will be seen in the next section to work also for the Schur complement in the time dependent case. <p> As for A j this is known to be the case. One may either employ a BPX strategy <ref> [5, 16, 26, 31] </ref> or a change of bases as suggested by (3:5:7) and (3.5.8) (see the remarks at the end of the previous section).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During the past few years very efficient preconditioners for linear systems arising from Galerkin discretizations of scalar elliptic boundary value problems have become available <ref> [5, 16, 26, 32] </ref>. These techniques combined with conjugate gradient schemes achieve optimal multigrid complexity under minimal regularity assumptions. <p> -modulus of smoothness is defined by ! d (v; t) L 2 () := sup jhjt k d where h;d := fx 2 : x + lh 2 ; l = 0; : : : ; dg and d d X j (1) dj v ( + jh) (see e.g. <ref> [16] </ref>). <p> In fact, one way to show that (2:19) still holds, is to establish an estimate of the form k (Q j Q j1 )v m k L 2 () &lt; see <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> As for A j this is known to be the case. One may either employ a BPX strategy <ref> [5, 16, 26, 31] </ref> or a change of bases as suggested by (3:5:7) and (3.5.8) (see the remarks at the end of the previous section). Moreover, in the stationary case (1:3) (and not too small) the Schur complements K j turn out to be already well conditioned [4].

Reference-contexts: The functions ~ ~ L j;k ; ~ ~ R j;k are defined analogously with the roles of ~ and ~ ~ interchanged. For simplicity, we confine ourselves here to reproduce thereby the same degree d 1 of exactness also for the dual side (see <ref> [17] </ref> for the general case). As in [1] one can verify that the ~ L j;k are linearly independent and refinable. It remains to biorthogonalize the sets ~ L j;k ; k 2 K j;L , and ~ R j;k ; k 2 K j;R , respectively. <p> j;k;m ~ R (3.3.9) satisfy ~ j;k ; ~ ~ j;m L 2 ([0;1]) Defining now ffi j := f~ j;k : k 2 K j g; ~ ffi j := f ~ ~ j;k : k 2 K j g; (3.3.11) the following facts can be verified (see also <ref> [1, 17] </ref>). Proposition 3.3 Under the above assumptions one has: (i) diam supp (~ j;k ) ~ 2 j ; k 2 K j ; #K j ~ 2 j . (ii) The ffi j are uniformly stable. 16 W. Dahmen, A.

It remains to determine the corresponding biorthogonal wavelets adapted to the interval. Again one retains possibly many wavelets in the form (3:1:5) as long as their support lies strictly in (0; 1). For the construction of the modifications near the endpoints we refer to [1, 12, 17]. <p> It remains to determine the corresponding biorthogonal wavelets adapted to the interval.

Here it is important to note that these coefficients are also independent of the level j and therefore have to be determined only once by solving small linear systems. Remark 3.4 The particular choice of the boundary functions makes it easy to incorporate homogeneous boundary conditions. <p> The remaining ones interfering with the end points of the interval have to be properly modified. Since at this point we do not have to make use of their explicit representation we refer to <ref> [17] </ref> for a listing of the corresponding coefficients. The important point here is to realize that instead of applying an analogous construction also for the spaces S (ffi fl j ) and S ( ~ ffi fl bases j and ~ j already determine the wavelets for these latter spaces. <p> () and 0 (), or S j = S ( ~ j;0 ) and H s = H s () " H 1 Proof: Since the claims are quite in keeping with what one expects under the given circumstances we will only indicate the main steps here and refer to <ref> [17] </ref> for a detailed proof of the above statements. <p> We dispense here with the precise technicalities and refer to <ref> [17] </ref> for the details. 3.5 Preconditioning As pointed out in Section 2 (see also [14, 15] for details), the direct and inverse estimates in Proposition 3.9 and Corollary 3.10 entail a wider range of norm equivalences than just the L 2 -Riesz basis property.
