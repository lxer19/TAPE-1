Reference-contexts: In this paper we will begin with the intuitive geometrical situation drawn in Figure 1, below, which turns out to be intimately connected with the iteration of functions in one variable. In Section 2 the corresponding functional equations are solved by the classical methods of Schroder [10] and Abel <ref> [1] </ref>. Section 3 is devoted to the involutory case which is picked up in Section 4 by means of a particular example. In fact it is this example from three-dimensional geometry, being devised by R. Resch and publicised by F. Stenger [11] that gave the inspiration for this paper. <p> Schroder, [11]). This early work was soon carried on by N. H. Abel <ref> [1] </ref>, G. Konigs [7], and E. Kasner [5], and the field has been active up to the present day. Besides the large bibliography in [9] a commented bibliography up to 1964 by Targonski [13] is mentioned. <p> Using the idea of introducing appropriate "coordinates" [3], we introduce the formal conjugacy of the map R with the shift map S p (x) := x+p (p is an appropriately chosen shift), by means of an belfunction or logarithm ofiteration <ref> [1] </ref> (x) for R: R = S p or (R (x)) = p + (x) :(8) If both and 1 exist, we have R = 1 S p , and we immediately verify that Q = 1 S p is a solution of Equ. (5). <p> Upon replacing z by 1 z in the family of trajectories G (z), we may ask: orwhattrajectoriesG (z)dowehave G (1 z) = A 2 (z)? Equivalently, since A 2 (z) = q 1 G 2 (z), for what functions G defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and such that 0 G (z) 1 do we have G (1 z) = 1 G 2 (z) ?(19) We notice that the functions A and B are involutory, i.e. on the interval [0; 1] they satisfy A 1 (z) = A (z) and B 1 (z) = B <p> A 2 (z) = q 1 G 2 (z), for what functions G defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and such that 0 G (z) 1 do we have G (1 z) = 1 G 2 (z) ?(19) We notice that the functions A and B are involutory, i.e. on the interval [0; 1] they satisfy A 1 (z) = A (z) and B 1 (z) = B (z), and we furthermore restrict the family F of functions G such that G 1 (z) = G (z)(20) for all of the functions G 2 F .

Reference-contexts: Besides initial conditions additional requirements such as monotonicity are needed in order to select a distinguished particular solution. The topic of functional equations has been active since the beginnings of calculus, e.g. with Euler's gamma function (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), up to the present day. A recent encyclopedia volume by Kuczma et.al. [9] contains an extensive bibliography of more than 800 references. The recent revival of the field is due to the connection between certain functional equations and the modern theory of dynamical systems. <p> Due to the construction in Section 3, however, the same solution G is obtained from the Abel function based on the most regular behaviour as z ! 1. Considerations of this type are important in identifying the gamma function as the "best" solution of its functional equation (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>); for other examples see Kneser [6], Szekeres [12].
