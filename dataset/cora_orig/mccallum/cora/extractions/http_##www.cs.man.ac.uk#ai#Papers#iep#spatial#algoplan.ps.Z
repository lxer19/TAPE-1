Title: An Algorithm for Planning `Sensible' Routes

Abstract: The problem of finding an optimal route between two points in a space strewn with obstacles has been extensively studied in robotics. The standard approach to such problems is first to reduce the original geometrical specification to a finite graph of possible routes, and then to use graph-searching techniques together with the metrical information available in the original geometrical specification to select the best of these routes. The algorithm presented here, by contrast, employs a `first-past-the-post' approach to route planning. Specifically, we show that the algorithm is guaranteed to produce a route satisfying a certain criterion of `sensibleness', because routes failing this criterion are always slower to get constructed. The approach taken here differs in three respects from most current work on route planning: (i) it finds sensible, but not necessarily optimal, routes; (ii) it is uninfluenced by perspective (though it is limited by occlusion problems); (iii) it produces its output in a qualitative form, which is nevertheless well-suited to guide the appropriate route-following behaviour.
