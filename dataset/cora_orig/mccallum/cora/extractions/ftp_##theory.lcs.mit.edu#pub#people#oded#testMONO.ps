Title: A Note on Testing Monotonicity  
Author: Oded Goldreich Shafi Goldwasser Dana Ron 
Date: October 1997 (revised April 1998)  
Abstract: We show that under a certain conjecture regarding the boolean lattice, there exists an efficient algorithm for testing whether a function is monotone or *-far from Note: The said combinatorial conjecture has been recently proven in collaboration with Eric Lehman. We plan to write a joint paper presenting these results. [April 12, 1998] monotone.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 1 For every S D 1 , there exists a 1-to-1 mapping from S into 1 (S), such that for each x 2 S, (x) &lt; y. 1 This is not the standard definition of a shadow <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Proof: We first show that for every T D 1 , j 1 (T)j jTj. Assume towards the contradic-tion that, for some T D 1 , j 1 (T)j &lt; jTj.

Reference-contexts: Thus z &gt; x and contradiction follows as in Item 1. The claim follows. 2 Consider any set S D 1 . We have established that for every T S, j 1 (T)j jTj. The lemma follows from Hall's Theorem <ref> [2, Thm. 6.12] </ref>: Consider the bipartite graph G whose vertex set is labeled by the strings in S [ 1 (S), and whose edge set is f (x; y) : x 2 1 (S); y 2 S; x &lt; yg. <p> The edges between S and I are as in G n and edges between I and R correspond to directed paths in G n . We show that the minimum s t vertex-separator in A has size m def = jSj. Claims (1) and (2) follow by Menger's Theorem <ref> [2, Thm. 6.4] </ref>, which guarantees the existence of m vertex-disjoint paths from s to t. Assume in contradiction that there exists a vertex-separator C of size smaller than m in A.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the first problems we considered while working on our paper on Property Testing <ref> [3] </ref>, is testing Monotonicity of (Boolean) functions. A function f : f0; 1g n 7! f0; 1g is called monotone if f (x) f (y), for every x &lt; y, where the partial order between strings is defined analogously to the set inclusion relation.
