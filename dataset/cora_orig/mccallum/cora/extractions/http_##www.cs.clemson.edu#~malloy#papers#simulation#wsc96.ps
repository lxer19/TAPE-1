Abstract: Figure 5: Experimental Results ways. First, we are modifying the analysis model to address the Pentium Pro Processor. Second, to further demonstrate the extensibility of our model, we are looking at our design to build an object-oriented framework. As we extend our design over a series of more and more complex processor architectures, ending at a simulator for a Pentium Pro, we will validate our design in terms of its reusability and extensibility.
