Abstract: The CAC algorithm must efficiently determine if a new connection can be admitted by verifying that its QoS requirements can be met without violating those of previously admitted connections. In hard real-time systems, the QoS requirements are specified in terms of end-to-end cell deadlines and no cell loss due to buffer overflow. A CAC algorithm must account for interdependencies among connections caused by statistical multiplexing of cells in ATM networks. Furthermore, arbitrary topology of the network may lead to cyclic dependencies among various connections. We present an efficient CAC algorithm that addresses the above issues. The algorithm uses a traffic descriptor called the maximum traffic rate function to effectively compute bounds on end-to-end delays of connections and buffer requirements within the network. Our work differs from most previous work in that it does not require traffic restoration inside the network.

Reference-contexts: A key step in the process is the description of a connection's traffic inside the network. Many traffic descriptors varying in the number of parameters have been proposed in the literature <ref> [1, 4, 9, 18, 22] </ref>. We adopt a maximum rate function discussed in [18]. While much of the previous work assumes re-creation of original traffic to some degree within the network, the use of the maximum function frees us from this assumption. <p> Hence, the delay at every server can be obtained if the input traffic pattern of all the connections sharing the server is known. The traffic pattern of a connection at a point in the network is characterized by a traffic descriptor <ref> [1] </ref>. It must be noted that due to multiplexing at ATM switches the traffic pattern of a connection at any point in the network need not be the same as that at its source [1, 4, 18]. <p> It must be noted that due to multiplexing at ATM switches the traffic pattern of a connection at any point in the network need not be the same as that at its source <ref> [1, 4, 18] </ref>. In this paper, we consider the following traffic descriptor: Maximum rate function descriptor: This descriptor uses the notation (I ) to specify the maximum arrival rate of cells in an interval of length I . <p> The connections in the network form a symmetric pattern. The system is arranged in such a way that 60 connections share one inter-switch link at each stage. Since our target applications are hard real-time systems, we consider the Source Traffic Descriptor (STD <ref> [1] </ref>) for the HRT connections to be the traditional HRT source traffic model.

We are dealing with hard real-time systems which have stringent deadline and buffer requirements. Our CAC algorithm exploits the restrictions imposed by hard real-time systems.
