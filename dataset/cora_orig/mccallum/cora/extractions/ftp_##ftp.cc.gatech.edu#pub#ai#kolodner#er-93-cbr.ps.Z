Abstract: Case-based reasoning can be used to explain many creative design processes, since much creativity stems from using old solutions in novel ways. To understand the role cases play, we conducted an exploratory study of a seven-week student creative design project. This paper discusses the observations we made and the issues that arise in understanding and modeling creative design processes. We found particularly interesting the role of imagery in reminding and in evaluating design options. This included visualization, mental simulation, gesturing, and even sound effects. An important class of issues we repeatedly encounter in our modeling efforts concerns the focus of the designer. (For example, which problem constraints should be reformulated? Which evaluative issues should be raised?) Cases help to address these focus issues.

Reference-contexts: When a design experience is recalled, it suggests a potential solution that can be critiqued with respect to the new problem, adapted to meet the needs of the new situation, or merged with other proposed solutions. We believe that case-based reasoning <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> can play a large role in modeling these processes. Research in case-based reasoning has provided extensive knowledge of how to reuse solutions to old problems in new situations, how to build and search case libraries (for exploration of design alternatives), and how to merge and adapt cases. <p> Many of these can be encoded straightforwardly in the familiar framework of typical case descriptions, which in general capture a problem, its solution, and the outcome of the solution <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. However, there are key representational issues to be solved. One is how to encode the imagistic information that seems to be a prominent part of what is recalled and reasoned about with respect to a device.

Reference-contexts: An important open problem is determining which kinds of derived features tend to be most useful for design, whether there is a set of derived features that is common to design across domains, and when those features get derived. Recent studies of creative problem solving protocols <ref> (Kolodner and Penberthy, 1990) </ref> suggest that anticipatory indexing is not sufficient to fully explain retrieval. Features that were not salient at the time a case was experienced might be important for retrieval in the current situation.

Reference-contexts: Routine design assumes a completely specified problem is given and little effort is applied to elaborating or designing a feasible specification. The kind of design we call creative, on the other hand, includes a process of "designing the design specification" <ref> (Tong, 1988) </ref>, going from an incomplete, contradictory, and underconstrained description of what needs to be designed to one with more detail, more concrete specifications, and more clearly defined constraints.
