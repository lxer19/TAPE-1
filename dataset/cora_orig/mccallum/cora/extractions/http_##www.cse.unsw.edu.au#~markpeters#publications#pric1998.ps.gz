Title: Autonomous Multi-Domain Attention Control

Abstract: This paper addresses four questions concerning control of attention: how to direct attention to novel or interesting events in the world, how to separate novel or interesting information from everything else, how to perform this segmentation of the world at multiple levels, how to develop perceptual machinery capable of this. To all four questions we provide answers arising from work in our WRAITH project. Each answer proves to be effective in both an engineering sense (having contributed to the control of an active vision robot in natural surroundings) and a scientific sense, having sufficient biological plausibility to be a working hypothesis about natural visual systems.

Reference-contexts: The ecological approach has been given considerable support in the last few years, at a strategic level by the school of situated cognition [14], and at a tactical level with the advent of active vision <ref> [1] </ref>. Gibsons work is particularly relevant to active vision because of its emphasis on behaviour, embodiment, real world operation, real time, and goals.

Reference-contexts: we describe below, does exactly what Gibson sought: it creates both a synthesis of past and present and a direct flagging of change. 2 Defining the Problems Understanding physical actions is an essential part of our cognitive repertoire, to the extent that people without this ability excite considerable neuropsychological curiosity <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. Usually taken for granted, this understanding probably involves a complex synthesis of many levels of perception, from simple reactive motion detection up to an apprehension of the full sociocultural import of an action. These levels of perception are almost certainly interactive.

Reference-contexts: Thus there is also support for the standard top-down, or model-based, conceptualisation of vision. Standard conceptualisations of specific perceptual levels tend to be rather heterogeneous: mathematical when it comes to low levels [13], and by turn logic based [5], linguistic <ref> [3] </ref>, and informal [10] at higher levels. However, it is rather difficult to propagate a reinforcement function through a set of heterogeneous systems.

Reference-contexts: I suspect that the neo-cortex uses special learning algorithms that permit each cortical area to extract new categories from experience, even though each area is embodied in a complex processing hierarchy. <ref> [4] </ref> We suspect that these special learning algorithms are adaptively homeostatic, each causing an additional layer to evolve only when it fails to maintain equilibrium on its own.

Reference-contexts: In other words, it has no need to keep telling itself that things are still the same. It is not surprising then, that over time individual neurons, and even semi-discrete neural systems, exhibit reduction in response to unvarying stimuli <ref> [6] </ref>. The processes are called habituation, adaptation, or depletion, depending on the context. Such neural units effectively report onset and offset, not absolute values. On top of this, though, there appears to be a curiosity drive ensuring that learning is never complete, by constantly introducing new situations into experience.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5 shows the relationship between the kinds of complexity in the world, the concomitant degrees of articulation required in perceptual systems and the corresponding levels of response that are possible. It also suggests how Dennetts Kinds of Minds <ref> [7] </ref> might map to these ideas. While aware of the vast gulf that lies between current performance and full understanding of movement, we feel our approach contains a valuable principle, that of demand-driven recursive auto-generation of higher-level perceptual layers.

Reference-contexts: This means avoiding situations that are similar to the past, and being selective in any particular situation, so that the system focuses on only the most novel inputs. There is good evidence of active novelty-seeking behaviour in infants as young as four weeks. Eimas et al <ref> [8] </ref> connected a rubber nipple to a tape recorder so that the infants sucking action made it play. The faster they sucked, the louder it played. The experiment showed that infants were able to associate sucking with change in the variety of sounds they heard.
