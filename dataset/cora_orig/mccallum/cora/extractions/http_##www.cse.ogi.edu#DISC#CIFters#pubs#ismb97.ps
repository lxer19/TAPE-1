Abstract: The maintenance of software which uses a rapidly evolving data annotation scheme is time consuming and expensive. At the same time without current software the annotation scheme itself becomes limited and is less likely to be widely adopted. A solution to this problem has been developed for the macromolecular Crystallographic Information File (mmCIF) annotation scheme. The approach could be generalized for a variety of annotation schemes used or proposed for molecular biology data. mmCIF provides a highly structured and complete annotation for describing NMR and Xray crystallographic data and the resulting macromolecular structures. This annotation is maintained in the mmCIF dictionary which currently contains over 3,200 terms. A major challenge is to maintain code for converting between mmCIF and Protein Data Bank (PDB) annotations while both continue to evolve. The solution has been to define a simple domain specific language (DSL) which is added to the extensive annotation already found in the mmCIF dictionary. The DSL calls specific mapping modules for each category of data item in the mmCIF dictionary. Adding or changing the mapping between PDB and mmCIF items of data is straightforward since data categories (and hence mapping modules) correspond to elements of macromolecular structure familiar to the experimentalist. Each time a change is made to the macromolecular annotation the appropriate change is made to the easily located and modifiable mapping modules. A code generator is then called which reads the mapping modules and creates a new executable for performing the data conversion. In this way code is easily kept current by individuals with limited programming skill, but who have an understanding of macromolecular structure and details of the annotation scheme. Most important, the conversion process becomes part of the global dictionary and is not open to a variety of interpretations by different research groups writing code based on dictionary contents. Details of the DSL and code generator are provided.

Reference-contexts: The domain scientist need only add the appropriate mapping to the mapping modules and regenerate the code needed for correct conversion. pdb2ocif is an application that uses this code generation scheme and is based upon the Perl translator pdb2cif <ref> (Bernstein, Bernstein, and Bourne, 1997) </ref>. Details of the DSL There were two design goals for the DSL. First, it should be a simple language that biologists could comprehend and easily extend as the PDB and mmCIF data representations evolve. <p> Language Specific Extensions to the Mapping Modules In this application Perl code had already been written <ref> (Bernstein, Bernstein, and Bourne, 1997) </ref> to map PDB record types and their associated fields to mmCIF data items. Rather than recode this information it was encapsulated in C++ classes. An example of this encapsulation was the Perl notion of an associate array written as the C++ class "AssocArray.

Reference-contexts: Small molecule crystallography has had such a data description since 1990 and an extension has recently been defined for macromolecular crystallography. The small molecule description is referred to as the Crystallographic Information File (CIF; Hall, Allen, and Brown, 1991), and the macromolecular extension mmCIF <ref> (Bourne et al. 1996) </ref>. While improved content and context are welcome there remains the issue of maintaining software which uses this annotation, since this annotation evolves very fast while under development and continues to evolve as the knowledge of the discipline increases and experimental methods change.

Reference-contexts: This mapping is contained within a single module to minimize the number of mapping modules needed for full mmCIF dictionary coverage. The mapping modules use the PDBlib representation of a macromolecular structure <ref> (Chang et al. 1994) </ref>. PDBlib is a C++ class library which has been used extensively to represent and navigate data parsable from a PDB file (Shindyalov et al. 1994; Biggs et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Data in many areas of molecular biology are growing exponentially. This massive amount of data begs asking many new questions particularly in the area of comparative analysis. For example, in beginning to compare whole genomes <ref> (Hood et al. 1992) </ref> for common evolutionary origins and in classifying and comparing protein structures through the presence of common structural motifs (Holm and Sander, 1996; Orengo et al. 1996; Murzin et al. 1995).
