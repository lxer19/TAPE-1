Abstract: PO Box 600 Wellington New Zealand Tel: +64 4 471 5328 Fax: +64 4 495 5232 Internet: Tech.Reports@comp.vuw.ac.nz Abstract Large repositories of historical data about the natural world present novel opportunities to assist decision makers and problem solvers. Past cases or scenarios that are similar to a problem of current interest can often provide valuable insights or suggest solutions to the problem. We are constructing a case retrieval system that is intended to give meteorologists fast access to relevant past weather situations. The system is to serve as a memory amplifier, allowing users to rapidly locate historical situations of interest. In particular, forecasters should be able to use the system to quickly retrieve situations that are similar to the current one in meteorologically significant respects, providing them with an additional source of information to supplement the output of numerical models. The case retriever is part of MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data. In designing the MetVUW case retriever, we have addressed challenging problems in three areas: representation of spatial and temporal knowledge, case selection, and similarity assessment. We have also identified a number of lessons for the design of intelligent databases in natural resource domains. This report also appeared in Proceedings of a Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and the Natural World, Melbourne, Australia, November 1993, and has been submitted to AI Applications.

Reference-contexts: Although Postgres does not currently support user-defined indexing methods, it does provide an unusually wide choice of built-in methods. Of particular interest to us, Postgres provides an R-tree indexing method that organises spatial data for efficient retrieval <ref> (Guttman, 1984) </ref>. Two-dimensional regions are approximated by the smallest rectangle that contains them. This indexing method allows the system to quickly retrieve all regions that overlap a given system or are contained in it.

Reference-contexts: The case retriever is part of MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data <ref> (Jones and McGregor, 1993) </ref>. Each case is a slice of time (or a sequence of time slices) for which meteorological data is available.

Reference-contexts: This new generation of tools focuses on those tasks that computers do best, namely searching and processing vast quantities of data. As far as possible, they avoid the much harder task of automatic decision making. The rapid rise in popularity of case-based decision aids in industry <ref> (Kolodner, 1991) </ref> is strong evidence for the success of this approach. Like the MetVUW case retriever, these decision aids employ a large memory of past cases and carefully designed domain-specific representations.
