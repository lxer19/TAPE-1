Title: CORBA interface for a DL Classifier  
Author: Sean Bechhofer, Ian Horrocks and Sergio Tessaris 
Date: March 1999  
Abstract: An update to the original CORBA specification document of February 1999. The specification has been altered slightly following the experience of building a prototype implementation. An IDL specification and DTD for concept expressions have been added.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The rationale behind providing a Description Logic (DL) reasoner as a network resource via the OMG's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) <ref> [1] </ref> is described in [3]. This document describes some initial experiments and a protoype implementation of the so-called "thick wrapper" which sits between the clients and the Lisp Server and provides basic reasoner functionality. 2 Architecture The classifier is seen from the clients as an object in the CORBA namespace.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, this data format would be described using IDL. However, IDL does not appear rich enough to define 2 the kinds of recursive data structures that we'd require in order to represent the descriptions. The solution adopted is to use eXtended Markup Language (XML) <ref> [2] </ref> as the format for representing concept descriptions. A Document Type Definition (DTD) states exactly which tags should appear in concept descriptions. A prototype DTD for concept descriptions is given in Appendix B. Table 1 shows how some simple expressions with corresponding markup.

The descriptions themselves have no associated functionality other than for determining what their structure is. Implementing them as objects may result in increased overheads as many message sends may be required to determine that structure.
