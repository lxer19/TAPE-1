Abstract: Automated Geometric Reasoning: Dixon Resultants, Abstract. Three different methods for automated geometry theorem proving|a generalized version of Dixon resultants, Grobner bases and characteristic sets|are reviewed. The main focus is, however, on the use of the generalized Dixon resultant formulation for solving geometric problems and determining geometric quantities.

Reference-contexts: It has been well-known that geometry theorem proving falls within the theory of real closed fields for which Tarski gave a decision procedure [55]. But algebraic methods were not successful in proving geometry theorems even with an implementation of a more efficient decision procedure due to Collins <ref> [1] </ref> for Tarski's geometry. The situation changed dramatically in the late 70's and early 80's when Wu Wen-tsun [62, 63] proposed an algebraic method based on Ritt's characteristic set computation [50] for proving a restricted set of geometry theorems. <p> The quaternion formulation of the Stewart platform presented below is by Emiris [21].

Reference-contexts: Impressive results achieved using Wu's method sparked a great deal of interest in automatic geometry theorem proving. In particular, Wu's work encouraged researchers to investigate algebraic methods other than the ones based on characteristic set computation for geometry theorem proving.

A theorem prover, GEometer based on these ideas is discussed in [18, 15] Direct Approach: In <ref> [13] </ref> as well as in [42], the direct approach is employed using a Grobner basis algorithm. A Grobner basis of the hypotheses polynomials is first computed without taking into account the conclusion. <p> This computation is done viewing polynomials as multivariate polynomials in the dependent variables with their coefficients being polynomials in the independent parameters. In other words, the computation is performed over the field of rational functions expressed in terms of parameters. In the method used by <ref> [13, 42] </ref>, it is thus essential to classify the variables in the geometry problem formulation into dependent variables and independent parameters. As stated before, once a Grobner basis is computed from the hypotheses, the conclusion is simplified with respect to the Grobner basis. <p> However, for most geometry problems, checking whether the conclusion polynomial is in the ideal of the hypotheses turns out to be a fairly effective heuristic. For more details, the reader can refer to <ref> [13, 42] </ref>. The subsidiary conditions produced by this method often turn out to be more complicated than the ones found using the refutational approach discussed in the previous subsection.

Reference-contexts: For geometry theorem proving, Gelernter's approach, however, had limited success as it could prove only simple plane geometry theorems whose statements involved lines and angles, and relations among lines and angles <ref> [14] </ref>. It is difficult to single out any theorem proved by Gelernter's program which could not be easily proved by humans. It has been well-known that geometry theorem proving falls within the theory of real closed fields for which Tarski gave a decision procedure [55].

In fact, it almost always fails if the polynomial system is not generic and even if generic, but of not n-degree.

Reference-contexts: This method has been experimentally found to be superior in performance on a wide variety of examples, in comparison with other elimination methods including Macaulay resultants, sparse resultants <ref> [21] </ref>, the characteristic set construction, and the Grobner basis construction. The method takes less time, less space, as well as the extraneous factors seem to be fewer (except in the case of the Grobner basis method which gives the exact resultant) [38, 37]. <p> In many cases, this invariant relation can be sep-arated, resulting in purely a property of an object, or image (s), which remains invariant under camera viewing. 6.3 Recovering Camera Motion from Two Images In <ref> [21] </ref>, a camera motion reconstruction, a basic problem in photogrammetry, is formulated as an elimination problem. <p> It thus appears that the camera motion reconstruction can be done on-line in real time using the generalized Dixon resultants. 6.4 Kinematics: Stewart's Platform The Stewart platform problem is a well-known benchmark from robotics and kinematics <ref> [27, 43, 45, 21] </ref>.

This formulation was first used by me in <ref> [28] </ref>. Besides the above two formulations of geometry theorems, many other different geometry problems arise in many application domains. Many of these problems can be formulated as elimination problems. <p> geometric reasoning problems. 3 Geometry Theorem Proving: Direct and Refutational Approaches There have been quite a few approaches proposed for automating geometry theorem proving using the algebraic formulation of geometry problems, prominent about them being the direct approach proposed by Wu [62, 64], and the refuta-tional approach proposed by Kapur <ref> [28] </ref>. <p> (since the hypotheses are linear in the dependent variables). (See below a brief review of Grobner basis and characteristic sets.) And, it can be easily checked that the conclusion indeed reduces to 0 with respect to the triangular form of the hypotheses. 3.3 Refutational Approach The second approach discussed in <ref> [28] </ref> is refutational, similar to the resolution method for first-order theorem proving and other refutational methods for reasoning. The conclusion of a conjecture is negated, and the inconsistency (or unsatisfiability) of the negated conclusion and the hypotheses is decided over an algebraically closed field. <p> If a hypothesis is a polynomial inequation (e.g., 5 and 6 in the parallelogram example), it can be converted into a polynomial equation by introducing a new variable as demonstrated in <ref> [28] </ref>. By the following theorem proved in [28], the validity of a geometry conjecture is equivalent to checking whether a finite set of polynomial equations generated from the conjecture has a common solution in the field of complex numbers. Theorem 1 ([28]): Given a quantifier-free formula f = ((p 1 = <p> If a hypothesis is a polynomial inequation (e.g., 5 and 6 in the parallelogram example), it can be converted into a polynomial equation by introducing a new variable as demonstrated in <ref> [28] </ref>. By the following theorem proved in [28], the validity of a geometry conjecture is equivalent to checking whether a finite set of polynomial equations generated from the conjecture has a common solution in the field of complex numbers. Theorem 1 ([28]): Given a quantifier-free formula f = ((p 1 = 0 ^ ^ p i = 0 <p> Generation of Subsidiary Conditions: The refutational approach can also be used for deducing subsidiary conditions when a geometry theorem proving problem is given in generic formulation, as shown in <ref> [28] </ref>. The hypotheses and the negated conclusion are transformed together to a standard form to see whether the conclusion logically follows from the hypotheses. If yes, then the method terminates affirmatively. <p> If yes, then the method terminates affirmatively. If not, then information about additional subsidiary conditions needed, under which the hypotheses logically imply the conclusion, can be extracted from the standard form. The following theorem in <ref> [28] </ref> serves as the theoretical basis of the method. Theorem 2 ([28]): Given a quantifier-free formula f = ((p 1 = 0 ^ ^ p i = 0) ) c); where p 1 ; ; p i ; c 2 Q [u 1 ; ; u k ; x 1 ; <p> be also nonzero, implying that the point C be distinct from A. (Note that u 3 being nonzero does not guarantee that u 2 2 + u 2 3 is nonzero over the field of complex numbers.) The above method has been successfully tried on almost all examples discussed in <ref> [28, 39] </ref>, including Simson's theorem, Pappus' theorem, Desargues' theorem, Gauss' theorem, nine point circle theorem. <p> And, this process is guaranteed to stop because of Hilbert's basis theorem. The result is a Grobner basis of the input ideal. Refutational Approach: In <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, a Grobner basis algorithm was used to implement the refutational approach for proving geometry theorems. <p> In <ref> [28, 29] </ref>, many examples are discussed and details about implementing the refutational approach are provided. A theorem prover, GEometer based on these ideas is discussed in [18, 15] Direct Approach: In [13] as well as in [42], the direct approach is employed using a Grobner basis algorithm. <p> For decomposing a reducible characteristic set, factorization over extension fields has to be performed. With reducibility check by factorization over extension field, the refutational method using characteristic set computation is complete just like the refutational method using the Grobner basis method <ref> [62, 28] </ref>. For the refutational approach, the characteristic set method compares favorably with a method using Grobner basis algorithm. This method was also tried for deducing subsidiary conditions. When no subsidiary conditions are given in a problem formulation, the method turned out to be quite slow. <p> A theoretical justification for this derivation is Theorem 2 in section 3.3 taken from <ref> [28, 29] </ref> about the elimination ideal of the hypotheses and the polynomial corresponding to the negated conclusion, just in the parameters, being different from 0. <p> And, one way to compute the elimination ideal of the hypotheses and the negated conclusion is to use a Grobner basis algorithm, as discussed in <ref> [28, 29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our experience suggests that no single method is uniformly good for different problems. Instead, different methods must be used for different problems, which calls for a need for developing a geometry reasoning system that supports a variety of elimination algorithms including the characteristic set, Grobner basis and resultant methods <ref> [30] </ref>.

Direct Approach: A characteristic set is first constructed from the hypotheses. Then the conclusion is pseudo-divided using the polynomials in the characteristic set. If the conclusion pseudo-divides to 0, then the conclusion generically follows from the hypotheses. <p> That observation can be viewed as a particular application of the use of a characteristic set construction for multi-variable elimination; for other such uses of the characteristic set method as an elimination technique, the reader may consult <ref> [31, 30] </ref>. Particularly, the characteristic set method can be used for deducing positive additional hypotheses as well.

Reference-contexts: Factoring polynomials in the elimination ideal can lead to identifying simpler subsidiary conditions corresponding to some of the factors. In a later section, we discuss this issue in more detail. 4 Dixon Resultants, Grobner Bases, and Characteristic Sets In this section, the generalized Dixon resultant formulation as developed in <ref> [35, 38] </ref> is first reviewed. It is shown how Dixon resultants can be used to implement the refutational approach to geometry theorem proving. This is followed by a brief review of Grobner basis and characteristic set methods to implement the direct as well as refutational approaches for geometry theorem proving. <p> Dixon's method, as discussed in [19], does not work for an arbitrary polynomial system. In fact, it almost always fails if the polynomial system is not generic and even if generic, but of not n-degree. In <ref> [35] </ref>, we developed a generalization of Dixon's resultant formulation so that it works for a family of polynomial systems that is much larger than systems of generic n-degree polynomials. <p> It is possible for the Dixon matrix to be rectangular, or even if it is square, to be singular. In that case, the rank submatrix construction, RSC, described in <ref> [35] </ref> can be used to extract identically non-zero projection operators from D P . The construction works as follows: if the removal of the column labeled with the monomial 1 reduces the rank of the Dixon matrix, then any maximal minor of the Dixon matrix gives a projection operator. <p> This method has been successfully used to compute projection operators for elimination problems arising in many different application domains; the reader may consult <ref> [35, 38, 52] </ref> for details. Below, we first discuss how the generalized Dixon resultant formulation can be used for geometry theorem proving. Later, we discuss the application of the method for other geometric reasoning problems.

Reference-contexts: that if the polynomial system consists of polynomials with the same set of terms (an unmixed system), the Dixon formulation, in fact, implicitly exploits the sparse structure of the polynomial system, i.e., its computational complexity is governed by the Newton polytope of the unmixed system, not by the Bezout bound <ref> [36] </ref>. Below, we first briefly review the generalized Dixon formulation for computing a projection operator of P . From now on, by a projection operator, we mean the projection operator as computed by the extended Dixon resultant formulation. Later, we discuss its application to geometric reasoning. <p> Perhaps the main reason the generalized Dixon resultant formulation is efficient on elimination problems is because it implicitly exploits the sparse structure of the polynomial system. For more details, an interested reader can consult <ref> [36] </ref> as well as [52]. 6 Other Geometric Problems In addition to geometry theorem proving and computing geometric quantities, algebraic methods including resultants, Grobner basis and characteristic set constructions, have been successfully used for other problems including implicitiza-tion, object recognition and camera calibration in image understanding, object modeling where geometry plays

For more details on extraneous factors in the projection operator computed by the generalized Dixon resultant formulation, refer to <ref> [37] </ref>. <p> This ordering affects significantly the computational performance of the methods as well as extraneous factors generated in the projection operators. These aspects of resultant methods are not understood, and should be investigated. In <ref> [37] </ref>, it is shown that for the Stewart platform problem, for certain orderings, the generalized Dixon method computes the projection operator quite fast, but at the cost of including numerous extraneous factors.

Later, we discuss the application of the method for other geometric reasoning problems. <p> b e . p 1 = a 2 p 2 = a 2 p 3 = b 2 This problem can be completely solved using the Dixon resultant formulation in less than 6 minutes on a Sun Sparc10 using our interpolation software for computing determinants of matrices with polynomial entries <ref> [38, 52] </ref>. Even using Maple's linear algebra package, the problem can be done in less than 17 minutes on SUN 4 and less than 9 minutes on a Sparc10. This shows the advantage of using the generalized Dixon resultant formulation over the characteristic set method. <p> Below, we briefly review the use of the Dixon resultant formulation for implicitization, invariant computation and an image understanding problem. For further details as well as the use of the Dixon formulation to other related problems, the reader may consult <ref> [38, 52] </ref>. 6.1 Implicitization We illustrate the use of Dixon resultants for the implicitization problem.

Reference-contexts: The variety defined by the hypotheses can be decomposed into components; the nature of the desired decomposition determines the effort involved. Full decomposition into irreducible components can be, in general, computationally quite expensive.

The above method has been successfully tried on almost all examples discussed in <ref> [28, 39] </ref>, including Simson's theorem, Pappus' theorem, Desargues' theorem, Gauss' theorem, nine point circle theorem. <p> Since then, many modifications and heuristics to improve the performance of this algorithm have been proposed; an interested reader may consult <ref> [64, 5, 6, 39] </ref>. Even though the characteristic set of is small, intermediate computations can swell, leading to large polynomial sets. The worst case complexity of computing a characteristic set is doubly exponential in the degree of the input polynomials. <p> An interested reader may also consult [69] where a different method that attempts to avoid factoring over extension fields is given; see also [59]. The direct approach has also been shown to work for other geometries including solid geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, as well as differential geometry. Refutational Approach: In <ref> [56, 39] </ref>, we showed how the characteristic set construction can also be employed to implement the refutational approach. It was shown that for many geometry problems, this method turns out to be superior in performance to the Grobner basis method for the refutational approach. <p> In <ref> [39] </ref>, an implementation of the above approach is discussed which is based on detecting a constant being included in a characteristic set. <p> Moreover, the subsidiary conditions found were usually too complicated. In that sense, the method using the Grobner basis algorithm is superior than this method. However, when an incomplete set of subsidiary conditions were provided, then this method could identify additional subsidiary conditions quickly. In <ref> [39] </ref>, a table comparing different methods on a number of geometry conjectures is given, along with heuristics to improve the performance of the method as well as different algorithms for computing a characteristic set. 5 Computing Geometric Quantities Many geometry problems involve computing an expression in terms of other parameters, for

Reference-contexts: Further, some of these subsidiary conditions can be unnecessary. 4.3 Characteristic Set Construction The key primitive operation used in characteristic set computation is that of pseudo-division of a multivariate polynomial by another multivariate polynomial (see <ref> [40] </ref> for more details about pseudo-division). Pseudo-division is different from the reduction used in a Grobner basis computation. Firstly, the recursive representation of polynomials is used: a multivariate polynomial is considered as a univariate polynomial in its highest variable.

Reference-contexts: Wu's approach and its variations have been experimented by many researchers including Wu himself [63, 64], his students Wang and Gao [61], Chou [4, 5], and Ko and Hussain <ref> [41] </ref>. A particular mention must be made of Chou's work and his system which has proved nearly 500 geometry theorems [5].

Reference-contexts: In particular, Wu's work encouraged researchers to investigate algebraic methods other than the ones based on characteristic set computation for geometry theorem proving. Kapur [28], Chou and Schelter [13], and Kutzler and Stifter <ref> [42] </ref> independently demonstrated the use of Grobner basis algorithms for geometry theorem proving. <p> In [28, 29], many examples are discussed and details about implementing the refutational approach are provided. A theorem prover, GEometer based on these ideas is discussed in [18, 15] Direct Approach: In [13] as well as in <ref> [42] </ref>, the direct approach is employed using a Grobner basis algorithm. A Grobner basis of the hypotheses polynomials is first computed without taking into account the conclusion. This computation is done viewing polynomials as multivariate polynomials in the dependent variables with their coefficients being polynomials in the independent parameters. <p> This computation is done viewing polynomials as multivariate polynomials in the dependent variables with their coefficients being polynomials in the independent parameters. In other words, the computation is performed over the field of rational functions expressed in terms of parameters. In the method used by <ref> [13, 42] </ref>, it is thus essential to classify the variables in the geometry problem formulation into dependent variables and independent parameters. As stated before, once a Grobner basis is computed from the hypotheses, the conclusion is simplified with respect to the Grobner basis. <p> However, for most geometry problems, checking whether the conclusion polynomial is in the ideal of the hypotheses turns out to be a fairly effective heuristic. For more details, the reader can refer to <ref> [13, 42] </ref>. The subsidiary conditions produced by this method often turn out to be more complicated than the ones found using the refutational approach discussed in the previous subsection.

Reference-contexts: Building model-based object recognition system using geometric invariants has recently become an active research area. Invariants of various objects (or their models) can be stored in a model library <ref> [46] </ref>. Invariants of image features can be used to index the model library to prune the search space for objects being recognized in an image. Invariant relations are expressions relating model features to image features, and they can be computed using elimination techniques. <p> One of our long term goals has been to develop algorithms and their implementations so as to enable off-line and on-line reasoning for object recognition and other image understanding tasks in computer vision. Despite considerable progress, it is still not possible to automatically compute invariants of geometric configurations <ref> [46] </ref>. When invariant computation is formulated as an elimination problem, it becomes too difficult to manage by currently implemented elimination techniques. With the generalized Dixon resultant formulation, invariants for only simple geometric configurations can be computed automatically [32]. Otherwise, considerable human interaction and guidance are required.

Reference-contexts: In that case, one can look for an additional positive hypothesis of the form t = 0 such that along with this positive additional hypothesis, the conclusion follows (after degenerate cases have been ruled out). Using this approach, Recio and Velez-Melon <ref> [47] </ref> have recently developed an educational package for teaching algebraic geometry by mechanically discovering geometry theorems. A geometric conjecture is first tested for validity. In case the conjecture is not true, a subsidiary condition (negative hypothesis) is looked for, possibly ruling out degenerate cases as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: The situation changed dramatically in the late 70's and early 80's when Wu Wen-tsun [62, 63] proposed an algebraic method based on Ritt's characteristic set computation <ref> [50] </ref> for proving a restricted set of geometry theorems. <p> The hypotheses consisting of polynomial equations are first processed and brought in a standard form. Wu and others following his approach used a triangular form, called a characteristic set, a concept due to Ritt <ref> [50] </ref>, as well as a finite family of characteristic sets. Chou and Schelter as well as Kutzler and Stifter used a Grobner basis as a standard form. In the second step, using this standard form, it is decided whether the conclusion follows from the hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: This method has been successfully used to compute projection operators for elimination problems arising in many different application domains; the reader may consult <ref> [35, 38, 52] </ref> for details. Below, we first discuss how the generalized Dixon resultant formulation can be used for geometry theorem proving. Later, we discuss the application of the method for other geometric reasoning problems. <p> b e . p 1 = a 2 p 2 = a 2 p 3 = b 2 This problem can be completely solved using the Dixon resultant formulation in less than 6 minutes on a Sun Sparc10 using our interpolation software for computing determinants of matrices with polynomial entries <ref> [38, 52] </ref>. Even using Maple's linear algebra package, the problem can be done in less than 17 minutes on SUN 4 and less than 9 minutes on a Sparc10. This shows the advantage of using the generalized Dixon resultant formulation over the characteristic set method. <p> Perhaps the main reason the generalized Dixon resultant formulation is efficient on elimination problems is because it implicitly exploits the sparse structure of the polynomial system. For more details, an interested reader can consult [36] as well as <ref> [52] </ref>. 6 Other Geometric Problems In addition to geometry theorem proving and computing geometric quantities, algebraic methods including resultants, Grobner basis and characteristic set constructions, have been successfully used for other problems including implicitiza-tion, object recognition and camera calibration in image understanding, object modeling where geometry plays an important role. <p> Below, we briefly review the use of the Dixon resultant formulation for implicitization, invariant computation and an image understanding problem. For further details as well as the use of the Dixon formulation to other related problems, the reader may consult <ref> [38, 52] </ref>. 6.1 Implicitization We illustrate the use of Dixon resultants for the implicitization problem.

It must be checked whether each polynomial included in the characteristic set factors over the extension field defined by the smaller polynomials in the characteristic set; this is an expensive computation. <p> For decomposing a reducible characteristic set, factorization over extension fields has to be performed. With reducibility check by factorization over extension field, the refutational method using characteristic set computation is complete just like the refutational method using the Grobner basis method <ref> [62, 28] </ref>. For the refutational approach, the characteristic set method compares favorably with a method using Grobner basis algorithm. This method was also tried for deducing subsidiary conditions. When no subsidiary conditions are given in a problem formulation, the method turned out to be quite slow.
