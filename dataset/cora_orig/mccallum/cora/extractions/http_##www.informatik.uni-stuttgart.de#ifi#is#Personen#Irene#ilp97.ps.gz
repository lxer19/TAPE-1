Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm for the discovery of first order clauses holding in an relational database in the framework of the nonmono-tonic ILP setting [1]. The algorithm adopts the principle of o*ine candidate determination algorithm used for mining association rules in large transaction databases [4]. Analoguous to the measures used in mining association rules, we define a support and a confidence measure as acceptance criteria for discovered hypothesis clauses. The algorithm has been implemented in C with an interface to the relational database management system INGRES. We present and discuss the results of an experiment in the KRK domain and conclude.

Formally, the approach belongs into the framework of the nonmonotonic semantics of ILP as defined in <ref> [1] </ref>, that is, the approach addresses the task of finding all out of a predefined set of regularities which hold in the given database.

The task in this framework is to find regularities holding in a given database where the database as well as the discovered regularities consist of sets of logical formulae, i.e., logical theories. A formal specification of the nonmonotonic ILP setting can be given as follows. <p> The coverage and accuracy of a regularity are among the most fundamental criteria for judging the relevance of findings in KDD. Such criteria are used, for instance, in the approaches for mining for association rules in large transaction databases [4], and in the ILP systems Claudien <ref> [1] </ref> and Mobal/RDT [3]. <p> This algorithm employs o*ine candidate determination in order to minimize the number of required database accesses.

When tested for classification accuracy on the 10.000 test examples provided in the KRK dataset, the coverage of these clauses (interpreted as a prolog program) was 0.9830 and their accuracy was 0.9943. <ref> [3] </ref> report comparable results for similar experiments on a different KRK data set, e.g., for Foil up to 0.981 cov./0.994 acc. This shows that our approach is able to find useful and sensible clauses, but the discovery process took very long. <p> This algorithm employs o*ine candidate determination in order to minimize the number of required database accesses.

(A clause is called range-restricted if all its head variables occur also in its body.) In analogy to <ref> [4] </ref>, these measures are termed support and confidence respectively. Since the measures realise quantitative evaluations of the coverage and accuracy of clauses, the selected model of the database is required to be finite. <p> sup and conf, so that both measures range between 0 and 1. 3 Adapting O*ine Candidate Determination for Clause Discovery In this section we present an algorithm which adapts the key idea of o*ine candidate determination 1 used in the OCD algorithm for discovering association rules in large transaction databases <ref> [4] </ref> to an algorithm for clause discovery in the problem setting defined above. Crucial for the applicability of the idea is the observation that the support decreases monotonically when specialising a clause by adding literals to the clause body. <p> A speed-up of this time is achievable by a smarter implementation of the subset test, (e.g., hash-tables as in the Apriori algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>). The current implementation stores clauses in an ordered list. An interesting topic for further research is to find improved mappings between the logical and relational formalism and mechanisms for declaring the hypothesis space which are better suited for the use with RDBMSs and exploit the characteristics of normalized relational databases.
