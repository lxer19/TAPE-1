Abstract: Time series problems involve analysis of periodic functions for predicting the future. A flexible regression method should be able to dynamically select the appropriate model to fit the available data. In this paper, we present a function approximation scheme that can be used for modeling periodic functions using a series of orthogonal polynomials, named Chebychev polynomials. In our approach, we obtain an estimate of the error due to neglecting higher order polynomials and thus can flexibly select a polynomial model of the proper order. We also show that this approximation approach is stable in the presence of noise.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen Chebychev polynomials for function approximation because truncation points can be chosen to provide approximate error bounds. It should be noted that the expansion of a function f (x) with n Chebychev polynomials, gives the least squared polynomial approximation with the n polynomials <ref> (Foxand & Parker 1968) </ref>. To produce a viable mechanism for building a model based on Chebychev polynomials would require the development of an algorithm for calculating the polynomial coefficients.

Reference-contexts: We can, however, truncate the above series and still obtain an approximation, ^ f (x), of the function <ref> (Gerald & Wheatly 1992) </ref>. The Chebychev polynomials converges faster than the Taylor series for the same function (Gerald & Wheatly 1992). Let us assume we are using only the first n terms of the series. <p> We can, however, truncate the above series and still obtain an approximation, ^ f (x), of the function <ref> (Gerald & Wheatly 1992) </ref>. The Chebychev polynomials converges faster than the Taylor series for the same function (Gerald & Wheatly 1992). Let us assume we are using only the first n terms of the series. For a rapidly converging series, the error due to truncation is approximately given by the first term of the remainder, i.e., a n T n (x).
