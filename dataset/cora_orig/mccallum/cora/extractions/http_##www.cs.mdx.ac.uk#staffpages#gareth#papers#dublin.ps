Abstract: ion in Process Planning Abstract Attempting to automate the entire process planning task tends to lead to systems of limited scope. Industry needs the benefits of generative computer aided process planning (CAPP) now however, so an approach to its introduction is needed that allows for both short-term benefits and long-term extendibility. This paper describes such an approach, based on raising the level of abstraction at which manual process planning is performed. By allowing planners to concentrate less on how things are done, and more on what is to be done, their workload could be reduced. Further, high level process plans have potential advantages over more detailed ones, and greater production efficiency could be obtained through allowing the precise manufacturing methods to be optimised computationally. This optimisation task is a complex one, but an appropriate technique is suggested.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Process planning is the task of specifying how something is to be manufactured. A process plan is a list of operations which, if followed, will transform a given raw material into a finished part. Much has been said about the potential benefits of computer aided process planning (CAPP) <ref> (e.g. Chang 1990 p.5) </ref>. Although CAPP is being used successfully in industry, most of these systems are retrieval type (variant) systems. These systems require a human operator to input simplified data about the part to be manufactured, and to edit the standard plan retrieved for the specific situation in hand. <p> Present CAPP systems tend either to automate only a small part of the total process planning task, or deal with only a limited range of components <ref> (Chang 1990, p. viii) </ref>. An automatic CAPP system is therefore beyond the state of the art for most companies. Even if this were not so, the development and application of such a system could take many man-years.

Reference-contexts: These problems involve search through a configuration space: the selection of a good combination of elements from a vast range of possible combinations. In fact, combinatorial optimisation is NP-complete <ref> (Harel 1987) </ref>. This means that it is part of a class of problems for which, guaranteed optimal solutions cannot be found in reasonable time. The aim is therefore to obtain a high probability of finding an optimal, or near-optimal, solution. <p> The aim is therefore to obtain a high probability of finding an optimal, or near-optimal, solution. A well-known example of a combinatorial optimisation problem concerns a travelling salesman <ref> (Harel 1987, Kirkpatrick et al 1983) </ref>. The salesman must find the shortest possible route that passes through every city in a given set.

Reference-contexts: The output of a process planning system is far better defined than its input; it is not clear what form of product models will be popular in the future, and it is also unclear exactly what information a process planning system would require of them <ref> (Husbands et al, 1988) </ref>. We know that we eventually require a precise specification of manufacturing operations, but since process planning is not yet fully understood, we don't know exactly what information is needed to produce a process plan.

Reference-contexts: Two very different solution methods were tried. The first was a classical type search process familiar in AI and operations research (based on the A* algorithm), while the second was a randomised technique known as simulated annealing <ref> (Kirkpatrick et al 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This must be done without violating any of the constraints imposed on the order in which operations can be carried out. These might be expressed as a set Palmer, Kelly & Weston IMC-9 of precedence constraints stating which volumes must be removed before which others <ref> (Kusiak 1991) </ref>. More generally, the list of operations could be combined with the constraints to give a partially ordered (nonlinear) plan (Willis et al 1989). The objective then would be the optimal linearisation of the plan, giving the lowest total part cost.

Reference-contexts: This is provided of course that the area chosen had practical value in its own right. A second argument is that it would not be sensible to attempt to introduce CAPP in one go <ref> (Logan 1986) </ref>. It would be more appropriate to gradually introduce a range of CAPP tools that could integrate with each other to provide an increasingly sophisticated level of support for process planners. 3.

These and other approaches are discussed in a previous paper <ref> (Palmer & Hall, 1992) </ref>. 5.2 Solution Methods It was found that the nature of the task is such that it is not necessary to resort to a knowledge based (expert systems) approach; there are other AI techniques which can lead to a simpler and more efficient solution.

Reference-contexts: The salesman must find the shortest possible route that passes through every city in a given set. There is a fixed set of sub-goals to be solved, therefore, and any one can be performed after any other (unlike problems in many domains, e.g. the blocks world <ref> (Winograd 1972, Rich & Knight 1991) </ref>. The cost of achieving each goal, however, depends on which goal was solved previously. The elements to be combined, in this particular case, are manufacturing operations.
