Title: A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme in Scheduling Deteriorating Jobs  
Author: Jin-Yi Cai Pu Cai Yixin Zhu 
Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem with a single machine and a set of jobs which have to be processed sequentially. While waiting for processing, jobs may deteriorate, causing the processing requirement of each job to grow after a fixed waiting time t 0 . We prove that the problem of minimizing the makespan|completion time for all jobs|is NP-hard. A fully polynomial time approximation scheme is developed for a special case where the job requirement grows linearly at a job specific rate after t 0 .
