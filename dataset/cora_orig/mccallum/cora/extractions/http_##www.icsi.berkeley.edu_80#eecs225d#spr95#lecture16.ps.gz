Abstract: This talk will be a journey through conceptual and historical aspects of various place/time perceptual experiments. Although many are now known to be inaccurate or even completely fallacious, all the experiments are, in one way or another, relevant to the issue of the place/time problem. We will conclude with what is believed to be a resolution of the place/time dichotomy by suggesting a model that accounts for the missing fundamental phenomena under a dual place/time paradigm. So far in this class, we've covered the basic mechanics of the auditory system. Herewith, we will attempt to understand the type of perceptual problems the auditory system is designed to solve. One example is the binding problem, i.e., how do we group together the acoustic patterns of an real-world object into a coherent perceptual source. We will study the place/time dichotomy[E78] by taking a look at a variety of relevant perceptual experiments and/or observations. The purpose of presenting these particular experiments is that, when considered together, they lead to a unified conceptual framework. In the following, no single experiment shows conclusively that either the place theory or temporal theory is correct. This will lead to our eventual conclusion that, similar to the final conclusion about the particle and wave theories of light, both the tonotopic and temporal properties of the auditory system are key in order to properly understand its workings and to accurately build a model.

Reference-contexts: Auditory nerve micro-channels correspond to a way of sensing resonances at specific locations in the coclea. This is accomplished by sensitivity to different delays across frequency channels. Detecting these delays 16-8 Lecture 16: February 24, 1995 Lecture 16: February 24, 1995 16-9 is probably performed by coincidence detector <ref> [A82] </ref> cells, i.e., neurons that fire in a small time window depending on the temporal difference of the firings of incomming neurons. If the temporal difference is outside a certain time window, then the cell doesn't respond as well as when the inputs are synchronous. <p> Phase Coding time derivative Perception Frequency Selectivity distinguish among spectral components Loudness perceived amplitude of signal Pitch - signal's perceived base frequency Timbre - signal's perceived spectral signature * (quite complex) Physiology Coincidence Detection <ref> [A82] </ref> input simultaneity facilitates firing Frequency Channel coherent excitation across tonotopic domain Integration spatial and temporal Micro-channel small number of auditory nerve fibers innervating same inner hair cell Neural Latency initial discharge time relative to signal onset Neural Synchrony across Channels temporal pattern of activation Phase-locking neural firing correlated with temporal

Reference-contexts: Actually, we now know that this value is about 16%. Later on, in the 1920's, Georg von Bekesy <ref> [B60] </ref>, who was a pioneer of modern research on the ear, wanted to know how the ear analyzes frequencies in a goal to design a better telephone receiver.

Reference-contexts: We will, however, try to present a theory that helps us answer this question. Note that the cochlear representation for three significantly different signals can be very similar under the mean-rate/place representation <ref> [Bi77] </ref>. Consider the 3 signals listed in Figure 16.3, a 70 dB sinusoid, a complex tone, and white noise. All have approximately the same mean firing rate across the characteristic frequencies of different neurons in the auditory pathways. But we know that different neurons have different characteristic frequencies.

Reference-contexts: Ohm reasoned by analogy that the ear must also do some form of encoding of auditory information, although he did not have any direct empirical evidence. This began the more than 100 years of controversy which followed. In the 1860's, Helmholtz <ref> [He63] </ref> proposed his place principle of frequency coding (i.e., his resonance theory). He postulated that there exists tuned resonators (See Figure 16.1) in the basilar membrane with a constant relative bandwidth or a constant Q of about 25 (recall that Q = center frequency/bandwidth).

Reference-contexts: This seems to suggest some form of lateral inhibition or other sharpening mechanism. One possible locus for this sharpening is in the cochlear nucleus. What is the origin of this enhanced frequency sharpener? Again, we do not exactly know. In 1952, Huggins <ref> [Hu52] </ref> worked on his phase principle (see Figure 16.4). This essentially relates to the sensitivity in the ear to the phase of neural excitation reflecting the traveling wave's transit time. This further suggests that spectral sharpening could be the result of such phase sensitivity.

Reference-contexts: The argument for temporal coding of frequency began with Wever's volley theory and received support by Schouten's model of the residue. We now describe each of the above in slightly more detail. 16.4.1 History of Place In the 1840's, Ohm <ref> [O43] </ref> proposed his acoustic law, which states that the ear does a form of Fourier analysis of sound. He was inspired by the then recent results of Fourier who stated that any waveform can be uniquely represented by an appropriate sum of sinusoids.

Reference-contexts: Weaver also noted that this neural frequency following deteriorates above 4-5 kHz. Interestingly, in experimental results, humans report that pitch of high frequencies is much less distinct than that of signals within the frequency following range. Recall the neural phase locking <ref> [RBAH67] </ref> we have heard about in class and that we have seen in interval histograms. Weaver suggested that individual nerve cells phase lock to the stimulus waveform and that the reported electrical potential reflected the integration of large populations of such phase-locked responses.

Reference-contexts: We've seen evidence that frequency is encoded by place along cochlea, but also evidence that frequency is encoded by timing information (temporal distribution of aural discharge). Schouten tried to solve this dichotomy in what is now called his residue model <ref> [S92] </ref>. He argued that the basis of the missing fundamental is the common periodicity of high-frequency, harmonically related components. In particular, the low harmonics are neurally encoded as independent frequency components. The high harmonics, however, are not seen as independent entities as there are interactions.

Reference-contexts: In the 1930s, we begin the modern age of such studies. In particular, the availability of more sophisticated electronics made new experimental techniques possible. Glen Weaver's Volley principle <ref> [W49] </ref> is particularly important. He recorded the temporal aspects of the electro-potential of animal nerve fibers. From these data, he concluded that the temporal information reflected an accross-channel reconstruction of a signal's periodicity. In other words, the fibers are temporally encoding the frequency information.
