Abstract: In this note we show that the so-called weakly extensional arithmetic in all finite types, which is based on a quantifier-free rule of extensionality due to C. Spector and which is of significance in the context of Godel's functional interpretation, does not satisfy the deduction theorem for additional axioms. This holds already for 0

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Let E-HA ! denote the system of extensional intuitionistic arithmetic in all finite types as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. Concerning equality, E-HA ! only contains equality = 0 between numbers as a primitive predicate. <p> WE-PA ! denotes the variant of WE-HA ! with classical logic. In contrast to (E), Godel's functional interpretation trivially satisfies QF-ER which was introduced in [4] for that very reason. It has been observed in the literature (e.g. in <ref> [5] </ref>, see also [6] for corrections) that WE-HA ! doesn't satisfy the deduction theorem for `deductions from open assumptions' (whose free variables are treated as parameters and hence are not permitted as proper variables in the quantifier rules as formulated in [5]). 1 The argument proceeds as follows: consider f = <p> It has been observed in the literature (e.g. in <ref> [5] </ref>, see also [6] for corrections) that WE-HA ! doesn't satisfy the deduction theorem for `deductions from open assumptions' (whose free variables are treated as parameters and hence are not permitted as proper variables in the quantifier rules as formulated in [5]). 1 The argument proceeds as follows: consider f = 1 g ` WE-HA where f; g are free function variables. <p> In this paper we deal with Spector's original rule and our definition of WE-HA ! thereby differs from Troelstra's definition in <ref> [5] </ref>. The deduction theorem for deductions from assumption, however, does hold under an appropriate variable condition for the quantifier-free fragment qf-WE-HA ! of WE-HA ! (see [1]). 2 Proof: Let Con PA the standard consistency predicate for Peano arithmetic PA. <p> (t PA ) = 0 x (0 1 )) and therefore WE-HA ! ` t PA = 1 0; i:e: which contradicts Godel's second incompleteness theorem, since WE-HA ! is conservative over Heyting arithmetic HA (as follows by formalizing the model HEO of all hereditarily effective operations in HA, see <ref> [5] </ref>). Hence (fl) above is false. So the theorem holds with B :j (x 2 (t PA ) = 0 x (0)) and A as above. 3 Corollary 2.2 The deduction theorem for both WE-PA ! and WE-HA ! fails already for closed 0 1 -axioms. <p> Then we have to use a consistency predicate for a sufficiently strong system. Final Comments: The failure of the deduction theorem for WE-PA ! (already for 0 1 -axioms) might suggest that a system like Troelstra's <ref> [5] </ref> PA ! (=(HA ! ) c ) which is neutral with respect to extensionality but still only contains equality for numbers as a primitive predicate, would be more favorable in the context of functional interpretation.
