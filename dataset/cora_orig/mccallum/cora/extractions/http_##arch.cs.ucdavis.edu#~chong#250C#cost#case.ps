Abstract: In this paper, we argue that because of recent technology advances, networks of workstations (NOWs) are poised to become the primary computing infrastructure for science and engineering, from low end interactive computing to demanding sequential and parallel applications. We identify three opportunities for NOWs that will benefit end-users: dramatically improving virtual memory and file system performance by using the aggregate DRAM of a NOW as a giant cache for disk; achieving cheap, highly available, and scalable file storage by using redundant arrays of workstation disks, using the LAN as the I/O backplane; and finally, multiple CPUs for parallel computing. We describe the technical challenges in exploiting these opportunities namely, efficient communication hardware and software, global coordination of multiple workstation operating systems, and enterprise-scale network file systems. We are currently building a 100-node NOW prototype to demonstrate that practical solutions exist to these technical challenges.

Reference-contexts: The key question is whether a NOW can run large programs with the performance as a dedicated large computer and run small programs with the interactivity of a dedicated workstation. To investigate this combination we simulated the impact sequential workstation jobs and MPPs jobs may have on one another <ref> [Arp*94] </ref>.

Like anyone else, super computer users work during the daytime, and therefore need good response time even during the daytime <ref> [Arp*94] </ref>. GLUnix needs to address both of these concerns, along with being tolerant of individual node failures. We discuss each of these issues in turn.
