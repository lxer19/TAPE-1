Title: A Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme for Weighted Planar Graph TSP  
Author: Sanjeev Arora David Karger Philip Klein Brown U. Andrzej Woloszyn 
Affiliation: Princeton U. Michelangelo Grigni Emory U.  Emory U.  
Abstract: Given a planar graph on n nodes with costs (weights) on its edges, define the distance between nodes i and j as the length of the shortest path between i and j. Consider this as an instance of metric TSP. For any " &gt; 0, our algorithm finds a salesman tour of total cost at most (1 + ") times optimal in time n O(1=" 2 ) . We also present a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the Steiner version of this problem.

This PTAS also achieves an approximation ratio (1 + ") in n O (1=") time. <p> Even in the absence of a spanner result, we can give a quasipolynomial-time approximation scheme for the Steiner variant by combining the techniques of this paper with that of Arora's original PTAS for Euclidean TSP <ref> [2] </ref>. In each step the algorithm tries a small (poly (n) size) family of separators, one of which is guaranteed to work. The approximation scheme runs in n poly (log n;1=") time.

Reference-contexts: This PTAS also achieves an approximation ratio (1 + ") in n O (1=") time. More recently, Arora <ref> [3] </ref> improved the running time of his algorithm to O (n (log n) O (1=") ), using randomization. The PTAS's for Euclidean TSP and planar-graph TSP, though discovered within a year of each other, are quite different. <p> Another open problem is to find a nearly linear time approximation scheme for the planar-graph TSP. The "charging" argument in <ref> [3] </ref> strongly uses the geometry of the plane and does not seem to apply to the graph metric case.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm has not been improved upon, and a general approximation scheme is unlikely since metric TSP is MAXSNP-hard [13]. Nevertheless, there has been recent progress for certain special classes of metrics. Grigni, Koutsoupias, and Papadimitriou <ref> [6] </ref> showed that if the metric is the shortest-path metric of an unweighted planar graph (that is, all edge costs are one), then a polynomial time approximation scheme (or PTAS) exists. It achieves an approximation ratio (1+") in n O (1=") time, where " &gt; 0 is any constant. <p> Our approximation scheme starts by extracting a spanner of the input graph; the spanner preserves distances between vertices but has a lower sum of edge-costs. Then, like some previous results about approximation schemes on planar (unweighted) graphs <ref> [8, 6] </ref>, our approximation scheme employs a technique for obtaining a hierarchical decomposition of the input graph. By "hierarchical" we mean that the decomposition is done in steps. <p> The useful aspect of our decomposition is that we show the existence of a (1 + ")-approximate salesman tour that crosses the boundary of each region in the decomposition O (log n=" 2 ) times. This is reminiscent of the approximation scheme for the unweighted case <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, we ensure that after contracting the edges that lie on the boundaries of the regions, we obtain a graph where each region is bounded by O (log n=" 2 ) vertices. Dynamic programming can be used to find the 1 2 optimal tour in this contracted graph. <p> Our proof uses ideas from Grigni, Koutsoupias, and Papadimitriou <ref> [6] </ref> as well as Lipton and Tarjan's planar separator theorem [8] and Miller's simple cycle separator theorem [10]. The performance criteria in our case are different from those of Lipton and Tarjan and those of Miller, so we must use these techniques differently.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The TSP has been a testbed for virtually every algorithmic idea in the past few decades <ref> [7] </ref>. Most interesting sub-cases of the problem are NP-hard, so attention has turned to other notions of a "good solution." An early approximation algorithm by Christofides achieves an approximation ratio 1:5 on every instance of metric TSP (namely, one in which the internode distances form a metric).
