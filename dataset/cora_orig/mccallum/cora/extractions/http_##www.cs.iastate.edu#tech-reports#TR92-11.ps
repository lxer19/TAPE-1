Reference-contexts: On this input, the strategy computes, in 2 q (jwj) steps, a fraction r 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> of its current capital to bet that w 2 A. <p> Only the following very weak type of one-way function is known to exist under the hypothesis that P 6= NP. Definition A weak one-way function is a function that is, for every polynomial t, weakly t (n)-one-way. Theorem 3.1.(Allender <ref> [1] </ref>). P 6= NP if and only if there exists a weak one-way function.

Reference-contexts: is very small. (The reciprocal of this probability can be regarded as the security of f against inversion by g.) One-way functions of this type have been extensively investigated and can be used to construct secure user authentication schemes [6], secure pseudorandom generators [14, 13], subexponential time simulations of BPP <ref> [27, 3] </ref>, secure private key encryption protocols [11, 17, 8], bit commitment protocols [24], and zero-knowledge proofs of NP languages [10]. <p> Yao [27] and Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [3] </ref> proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). <p> In particular, if the adversary uses a pseudorandom generator, then the seed length must exceed n k . 4 BPP-Pairs and Pseudorandom Generators Yao [27] proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then R *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [3] </ref> subsequently refined Yao's ar gument to get the (apparently) stronger conclusion that BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). In this section we prove that the hypothesis (fiNP j E 2 ) 6= 0 implies a partial converse of this result. <p> A uniformly secure pseudorandom generator is a function that is a nonuniformly secure p (n)- generator for some polynomial p (n) n + 1. The following well-known result relates pseudorandom generators to the deterministic time complexity of BPP. Theorem 4.1. (Yao [27], Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [3] </ref>). If nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). 2 In fact, Yao, Boppana, and Hirschfeld essentially proved the following, perhaps stronger, result. We include the proof for completeness, but emphasize that it is a minor modification of the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Reference-contexts: P 6= NP if and only if there exists a weak one-way function. Using work of Karp and Lipton [16], one can show that the stronger hypothesis 2 6= 2 implies the existence of functions that are, for all polynomials t and r, weakly (t (n)=r (n))-one-way (see also <ref> [4] </ref>), but such functions still do not provide a useful amount of security. 7 We now come to the main result of this section.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking, a balanced function is an honest function with the additional property that no element of the range has much more than its "fair share" of preimages. We show that fiNP is a subclass of NP that contains all efficiently rankable languages in P <ref> [7] </ref>, as well as 3SAT and other NP languages. The hypotheses P 6= NP and fiNP 6 P are thus equivalent. The main results of this paper concern the stronger hypothesis (fiNP j E 2 ) 6= 0. <p> Observation 2.2. fiNP NP It is not clear that P fiNP. However, it is easy to see that fiNP contains all languages that have efficient ranking functions (see <ref> [7] </ref>).

In particular, if the adversary uses a pseudorandom generator, then the seed length must exceed n k . 4 BPP-Pairs and Pseudorandom Generators Yao <ref> [27] </ref> proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then R *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). Boppana and Hirschfeld [3] subsequently refined Yao's ar gument to get the (apparently) stronger conclusion that BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). <p> Typically, the polynomial p (n) is much larger than n, so that the generator g, given a short seed x, outputs a long, hopefully pseudorandom, string g (x). The desired notion of pseudorandomness is given by the following definitions, due to Yao <ref> [27] </ref>. Definition A nonuniform test is a language T 2 P/Poly. <p> A uniformly secure pseudorandom generator is a function that is a nonuniformly secure p (n)- generator for some polynomial p (n) n + 1. The following well-known result relates pseudorandom generators to the deterministic time complexity of BPP. Theorem 4.1. (Yao <ref> [27] </ref>, Boppana and Hirschfeld [3]). If nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). 2 In fact, Yao, Boppana, and Hirschfeld essentially proved the following, perhaps stronger, result.
