Reference-contexts: (:; ~) is a duality (i.e. ~ :a = a and : ~ b = b for all a 2 P; b 2 Q), then the same conclusion is true. a lattice in the topology induced by the collection of X a 's is of independent interest in topology (Banaschewski, <ref> [6] </ref>). Turning to naturally arising kinds of space for our duality results, rather than to some forced kind of space designed exclusively for the needs of representation, is an advantage, we think, of the approach we take here.

Reference-contexts: Very similar to Hardegree's application of polarities is the development in Davey and Priestley [11] of so called concept lattices.

Reference-contexts: A polarity (X; Y; ) gives rise to a galois connection from subsets of X to subsets of Y in a canonical way. Birkhoff and von Neumann <ref> [8] </ref> proposed their by now well known semantics for quantum logic in terms of Hilbert spaces, with the orthogonality relation on the closed subspaces used to interpret negation.

Reference-contexts: To obtain our duality results, we merge the traditions of Stone spaces, on the one hand, and a tradition of applications of polarities, on the other (for our purposes, polarities will be Kripke-style semantic structures). Birkhoff <ref> [9] </ref> abstracted a notion of polarity from the construction of the polar space of a closed subspace of projective n-space and pointed out a variety of other instances of the construction. <p> It is well-known that negation is a special case of galois connection 8 . And there is a tradition of interpreting negation by means of an incompatibility relation whose underlying ideas can be traced back to at least Birkhoff . Birkhoff <ref> [9] </ref> introduced a notion of polarity, as a generalization from the construction of polar spaces in analytic geometry and showed that every such polarity gives rise to a galois connection in a canonical way. <p> The stable sets are, by definition, the subsets A P such that A = A u` . The composite of the two maps of the galois connection is a closure operator (Birkhoff <ref> [9] </ref>), hence the stable subsets form a complete lattice. One then proves that the lower cones p#; p 2 P are stable and that the map p 7! p# imbeds the partial order in the complete lattice of its stable subsets.

Reference-contexts: Goldblatt [20], also in the second tradition, used a polarity (X; ?), which he calls an orthogonality space, for the representation of ortholattices. Orthogonality frames have been subsequently used for a Kripke-style semantics of quantum logic (Dalla Chiarra, <ref> [10] </ref>). (Ortho)negation, of course, is an instance of a galois connection.

Reference-contexts: world of events preventing every event in w (p) and ~ w (p) = the world of events prevented by every event in w (p) It is natural then to assume logical operators such that :w (p) = w (:p) and ~ w (p) = w (~ p): 11 Dunn <ref> [17] </ref> refers to the pair (~; :) as "galois connected negations", thinking of each of ~ and : as a subminimal negation, as explained in the sequel. 12 My not having at least 50 dollars prevents me from buying a copy of a book worth 50 dollars. <p> One notable exception is Hazen's subminimal negation in [24] which, algebraically, is merely an antitone map. A split negation comes in varieties, too. A minimal split negation is a pair of maps (~; :) forming a galois connection, which is the variety considered in Dunn <ref> [17] </ref>, called, as already mentioned, a pair of galois connected (subminimal) negations. We call it here a minimal split negation as it extends the familiar minimal negation resulting when the two maps in (~; :) are the same. <p> With a noncommutative prod uct, one is naturally led to considering a left and a right residual. 17 To the best of our knowledge, logics with a split negation have not been investigated prior to the initiation of the subject in Dunn <ref> [17] </ref>. 16 Chrysafis Hartonas and J. Michael Dunn seem to be of some significance, namely the De Morgan split negation and split orthonegation. Algebraically, the first is a self-duality operation, i.e. a galois connection with the stability requirements that, for all a, ~ :a = a = : ~ a.

Reference-contexts: Orthogonality frames have been subsequently used for a Kripke-style semantics of quantum logic (Dalla Chiarra, [10]). (Ortho)negation, of course, is an instance of a galois connection. Dunn <ref> [18] </ref> pointed out that every galois connection on a meet semilattice gives rise to a polarity (X; ?), in a canonical way. 1 A duality, in the case of partial orders, is a galois connection f : P ! Q op ; g : Q op ! P such that gfa <p> Goldblatt, in his representation of ortholattices [20], takes ? to be the relation defined on the space of filters by x ? y iff 9a 2 x; a 0 2 y, where a 0 is the orthocomplement of a. Dunn <ref> [18] </ref> takes a more general approach and uses ?-frames to interpret a galois connection on a meet semilattice. <p> Allwein and Dunn [2] use Urquhart's representation theorem as the basis for Kripke models for Linear Logic and related non-distributive substructural logics. The present paper may be seen as an application of an extension of Dunn's representation of galois connections in <ref> [18] </ref> and is part of the first author's dissertation research [22] in progress. In [23], the first author presents some further results on lattice representation and extends the representation and duality for lattices to lattice-ordered structures of logical significance.

Other examples include BCC and BCK logics [27].

Reference-contexts: Birkhoff and von Neumann [8] proposed their by now well known semantics for quantum logic in terms of Hilbert spaces, with the orthogonality relation on the closed subspaces used to interpret negation.

Orthogonality frames have been subsequently used for a Kripke-style semantics of quantum logic (Dalla Chiarra, [10]). (Ortho)negation, of course, is an instance of a galois connection. <p> We also point out here that, just like in the presence of an orthonegation the problem of representing joins is reduced to that of getting a representation of meets and of the orthonegation operator (Goldblatt, <ref> [20] </ref>), in the more general situation of two meet semilattices related by a duality, i.e. a galois connection S K op -f g such that f g = id K and gf = id S , joins can be defined by a _ b = g (f a ^ f b) <p> The orthogonal of a set S of vectors is then given by S fl = fxj (x; s) = 0 for all s 2 Sg. Goldblatt, in his representation of ortholattices <ref> [20] </ref>, takes ? to be the relation defined on the space of filters by x ? y iff 9a 2 x; a 0 2 y, where a 0 is the orthocomplement of a. <p> of sets X fl = DX (and similarly for DY ) can be alternatively characterized as the collection of stable sets in a way that extends Goldblatt's representation of ortholattices 18 . 18 Our argument in the proof of the following proposition is a small generalization of Goldblatt's argument in <ref> [20] </ref>. 18 Chrysafis Hartonas and J. Michael Dunn Given such a duality, the representation (functorial or relational) produced a galois connection (: fl ; ~ fl ) from PX to PY . Call a subset U X a stable set if ~ fl : fl U = U .

Reference-contexts: One then proves that the lower cones p#; p 2 P are stable and that the map p 7! p# imbeds the partial order in the complete lattice of its stable subsets. Hardegree <ref> [21] </ref> made yet another use of polarities, which he calls N K-structures (Natural Kind structures).

Reference-contexts: The stable subsets in this case are points, lines, planes etc. For a stable space U; U fl is its polar space (using Birkhoff's notation, rather than our :U ). 8 with the exception of subminimal negation (Hazen, <ref> [24] </ref>), which is merely an antitone map. 10 Chrysafis Hartonas and J. Michael Dunn A relation similar to that of a space to its polar space holds in the case of the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, namely the orthogonality relation. <p> The traditionally considered negation operations are instances of galois connections, where the two maps of the galois connection coincide. One notable exception is Hazen's subminimal negation in <ref> [24] </ref> which, algebraically, is merely an antitone map. A split negation comes in varieties, too.
