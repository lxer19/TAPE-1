Title: COMPLEMENTARITY AND NONDEGENERACY IN SEMIDEFINITE PROGRAMMING  
Author: FARID ALIZADEH, JEAN-PIERRE A. HAEBERLY, AND MICHAEL L. OVERTON 
Abstract: Primal and dual nondegeneracy conditions are defined for semidefinite programming. Given the existence of primal and dual solutions, it is shown that primal nondegeneracy implies a unique dual solution and that dual nondegeneracy implies a unique primal solution. The converses hold if strict complementarity is assumed. Primal and dual nondegeneracy assumptions do not imply strict complementarity, as they do in LP. The primal and dual nondegeneracy assumptions imply a range of possible ranks for primal and dual solutions X and Z. This is in contrast with LP where nondegeneracy assumptions exactly determine the number of variables which are zero. It is shown that primal and dual nondegeneracy and strict complementarity all hold generically. Numerical experiments suggest probability distributions for the ranks of X and Z which are consistent with the nondegeneracy conditions.

Reference-contexts: Nondegeneracy assumptions are not required for these results. However, without nondegeneracy assumptions the upper bounds need not hold for all solutions, and the lower bounds may not hold for any solution. We now compare our nondegeneracy conditions with that given by An-derson and Nash <ref> [AN87, p.21] </ref> in the context of infinite-dimensional LP over general cones. Let B X be the linear span of the face of K generated by X (the face of K containing X and having minimal dimension).

Both G n 2 ;m and V n 2 ;m are smooth manifolds and 1 is a smooth map <ref> [Boo75] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: HAEBERLY, AND MICHAEL L. OVERTON Definition 5. A subset E of a k-dimensional manifold M is said to have measure 0 if (E " U ) has measure 0 in R k for every chart (U; ) of M (see <ref> [GP74, p. 39] </ref>). Remark 1. <p> We say that f is transversal to K if the transversality condition (31) is satisfied for every x 2 M . The proof of the following Theorem can be found in <ref> [GP74, p. 68] </ref>. Theorem 10. Let F : M fi T ! N be a smooth map between smooth manifolds and let K be a submanifold of N . <p> F is a submersion <ref> [GP74, p. 20] </ref>. It follows that F is transversal to any submanifold DEGENERACY IN SDP 13 of S n . In particular it is transversal to each of the submanifolds M s , s = 0; : : : ; n.

Reference-contexts: Remark 1. The map 1 in (30) is locally trivial in the following sense: every point x 2 G n 2 ;m has an open neighborhood U whose inverse image, 1 1 (U ) V n 2 ;m , is diffeomorphic to the product U fiO m (see <ref> [Hu66] </ref>). Here O m denotes the Lie group of orthogonal m fi m matrices.

Reference-contexts: Assumption 2. The matrices A k ; k = 1; : : : ; m, are linearly independent, i.e. they span an m-dimensional linear space in S n . Assumption 1 (a Slater condition) implies (see e.g. <ref> [NN94] </ref>) that the duality gap X * Z = 0 for optimal solutions (X; y; Z). <p> The proofs use the notion of transversality from differential topology. A result similar to Theorem 8 is stated in [Sha96]. Theorem 9 does not seem to have appeared elsewhere. It is more appropriate for this discussion to write a semidefinite program in a self-dual form <ref> [NN94] </ref>. Let L denote the subspace of S n spanned by A 1 ; : : : ; A m .
