Abstract: We present algorithms for coupling and training hidden Markov models (HMMs) to model interacting processes, and demonstrate their superiority to conventional HMMs in a vision task classifying two-handed actions. HMMs are perhaps the most successful framework in perceptual computing for modeling and classifying dynamic behaviors, because they offer dynamic time warping, a learning algorithm, and a clear Bayesian semantics. However, the Marko-vian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signal|that it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory. The single-process model is often inappropriate for vision (and speech) applications, resulting in low ceilings on model performance. Coupled HMMs provide an efficient way to resolve many of these problems, and offer superior training speeds, model likelihoods, and robustness to initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: In gesture, the arms are neither independent nor wholly mutually determined; some form of interactional modeling is appropriate. Visually, a simple way to decompose upper-body gestures is to treat each arm as a process. Using a self-calibrating stereo blob tracker <ref> [1] </ref>, we obtained 3D hand tracking data for three T'ai Chi gestures involv-ing arm-motions: the left 1 single whip, the left cobra, and the left brush knee.

In practice, the algorithm appears to perform nearly as well without the conditioning steps, and in either case it works more robustly than a single HMM. Note that we do not take the Cartesian product of the output parameters.
