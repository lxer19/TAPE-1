Abstract: The conference Neural Networks in the Capital Markets was followed by a workshop at Caltech on November 23, 1996. The purpose of the workshop was to bring people together to share their experiences and ideas on designing and teaching new courses in financial engineering, bridging the gap between computationally advanced methods for learning from data, and real world problems in finance. This report highlights some of these ideas, and describes in detail one specific course taught at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. That course, Data Mining in Finance, focuses on computer intensive data analysis methods that are relevant to financial problems. The methods originate in fields such as statistics and probability, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computational science, applied mathematics, and engineering. They include neural nets, genetic algorithms, bootstrap methods, Bayes nets, Hidden Markov models, and clustering techniques. These methods are applied to problems that include building and evaluating technical trading strategies, and computing and managing market and credit risk. Beside the theory and the lectures, that course has two hands-on components. For each method, a computer assignment on a real world data set is placed between two lectures. The first lecture introduces the problem, discusses the essentials of the method to solve this problem, and demonstrates a software implementation. After students have gained some experience with the method and software in the lab, the second lecture summarizes strengths and weaknesses, and discusses further applications in the capital markets. The second hands-on component is a group project. It explores one of the approaches presented during the semester on a problem and data set selected by each individual group, usually in collaboration with a Wall Street firm. The course concludes with several Wall Street traders giving their perspectives on the practice and promise on data mining in finance. nical trading and finance has seen exciting results, as witnessed by several con ferences, including NNCM (Neural Networks in the Capital Markets) in 1993

Reference-contexts: The readings are taken from several sources, including Neural Networks in Financial Engineering (Refenes et al :, 1996), Decision Technologies for Financial Engineering (Weigend et al :, 1997), and the Proceedings of Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering <ref> (CIFEr, 1997) </ref>. One important ingredient throughout this part is the methodology of turning predictions (e.g., the expected value of a future return and its variance) into actions (e.g., taking a position of a certain size).

Reference-contexts: This part concludes with the discussion of a business case featuring First Union National Bank (Charlotte, NC). This bank, the nation's sixth largest banking company, uses a neural network in their non-linear transaction processing. This case study, written by Vasant Dhar at Stern <ref> (Dhar, 1997) </ref>, serves as the transition from risk management to the final part of the course that focuses on the role data mining methods are playing (and are going to be playing) in business and finance. 4 Part 4: Projects and Contact with Wall Street Traders The physical and intellectual proximity

Reference-contexts: Re-analyzing their data with Trellis graphics (a method of conditional histograms) uncovers some striking features, including the complete disappearance of the risk premium on size <ref> (Knez & Ready, 1997) </ref>. The background reading is an introduction to S-Plus , and the lab consists of reproducing the Trellis plots and further exploring the data that could lead to an understanding of the economic forces underlying the size effect.
