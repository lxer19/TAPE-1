Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the smallest clock period for a combinational circuit. By considering both the long and short paths, we derive three independent bounds on the clock period. The first bound is the difference between the longest path delay and the shortest path delay, which has been studied before [6, 9, 11, 12]. The other two take the functionality of the circuit into consideration, and therefore, is usually smaller than the first one. To bring in the functionality of the circuit, we make use of a new class of paths called the shortest destabilizing paths as well as the longest sensitizable paths. We also show that considering both the longest sensitizable path and the shortest destabilizing path together does not always give you a valid bound. The bounds on the clock period can be alternatively viewed as optimization objectives. At the physical level, the complexity of optimization very much depends on the number of long and short paths present and the number of gates shared by them. We conducted preliminary experiments to study this.

Reference-contexts: This technique is known as maximum-rate pipelining. However, this term could be misleading because it may not give the maximum possible clock rate. It is because, as indicated in <ref> [1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 15, 17] </ref>, the delay of the longest path may be a poor estimate of the actual delay of a circuit if there exists no input vector to propagate a signal along the longest path.

Reference-contexts: A related problem is to identify a set of long paths to be shortened so as to to reduce the delay of a combinational circuit to a user-specified value. This problem has been addressed before in <ref> [3] </ref>. We have experimented with several typical circuits in ISCAS85 and the results are tabulated in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. For simplicity, we assume that t c = t s + t h is zero.

Reference-contexts: This technique is known as maximum-rate pipelining. However, this term could be misleading because it may not give the maximum possible clock rate. It is because, as indicated in <ref> [1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 15, 17] </ref>, the delay of the longest path may be a poor estimate of the actual delay of a circuit if there exists no input vector to propagate a signal along the longest path. <p> We only assume that the delay of each gate is a single fixed value independent of the input signals. We shall address this point again in Section 3. 2.1 Sensitizable paths We adopt the floating mode operation <ref> [4, 5] </ref> in which the value of each lead is unknown before an input vector is applied. <p> The delay of the longest sensitizable path is the longest time that a circuit takes for its primary outputs to stabilize. In reality, the circuit does not operate under the floating mode and the transition between two input vectors should be considered. Nevertheless, it has been proved in <ref> [4, 5] </ref> that the delay of the longest sensitizable path computed as discussed above is an upper bound of the actual delay of the circuit. <p> Moreover, even if we only know the maximum possible delay for each gate instead of its exact delay, it is proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that the delay of the longest sensitizable paths obtained is still an upper bound on the actual delay of the original circuit. <p> The path sensitization criterion as defined above is difficult to be applied, and thus various approximation criteria <ref> [2, 4, 8, 15, 17] </ref> have been proposed that also can obtain a correct 5 estimate of the actual circuit delay. Recently, Devadas et.al. [7] and McGeer et.al. [16] pre-sented algorithms to compute the delay of the longest sensitizable paths without explicit path tracing and enumeration. <p> To obtain a rigorous proof of this statement, we can prove by induction that the output of each gate of the circuit will change no earlier than its destabilizing time computed according to our model. The argument is very similar to the one used in the case of sensitizability <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, and so the details will not be repeated here. <p> The similarity between the definitions of the destabilizing path and the sensitizable path also allows the different criteria proposed <ref> [2, 4, 8, 15, 17] </ref> to compute the delay of the longest sensitizable path to be used, with no or minor modification, to compute the delay of the shortest destabilizing path. <p> For example, the Loose Criterion described in <ref> [4, 5] </ref> can be modified as follows: Given a path P = (G 0 ; f 0 ; G 1 ; f 1 ; ; f m1 ; G m ), P is described as destabilizing if for each input f i of G i+1 , one of the following holds:

In <ref> [10] </ref>, the technique of clock skews adjustment is employed to minimize the clock period of a sequential circuit. Instead of modifying the circuit, an appropriate clock skew is determined for each individual latch.

Reference-contexts: The concept of shortest destabilizing path first appears in a very recent article <ref> [14] </ref>, but the rather confusing name shortest sensitizable path is used instead. In this paper, we show that a smaller clock period is feasible by incorporating the concepts of longest sensitizable and shortest destabilizing paths. However, we shall also point out a potential pitfall in using these two concepts together. <p> There are some inputs of G i+1 including f i whose initial stable values are controlling and the stable value at f i is the latest to become unstable among these inputs. 2 The same concept is also defined in <ref> [14] </ref>, but the term shortest sensitizable path is used instead. <p> Similarly, it may be possible to improve the bound for C p by replacing o min by the delay of the shortest destabilizing path o fl min . An algorithm to find the delay of the shortest destabilizing path is described in <ref> [14] </ref>. Therefore, there seems to be three other potentially better estimates of C p , namely, o fl max o min + t c , o max o fl max o fl min + t c .
