Abstract: Recent advances in the development of the INLEN system for multistrategy data exploration are briefly reviewed. These advances include the development of a metalevel language for data mining and knowledge discovery, called knowledge generation language (KGL), and the employment of a new type of attributes, called structured attributes. These features are illustrated by an example concerned with determining economic and demographic patterns in a database containing facts about the countries of the world. The results demonstrate a high utility of INLEN for data mining and knowledge discovery.

Reference-contexts: Earlier efforts to develop a language to assist in knowledge discovery tasks have been almost exclusively logic-based, using Prolog-style queries (e.g., LDL). One exception is an extension to SQL, called M-SQL <ref> (Imielinski, Virmani and Abdulghani, 1996) </ref>, which allows a user to query for certain types of rules and invoke a rule-generating operator.

Reference-contexts: Among the machine learning capabilities implemented in the current INLEN system are the ability to learn different types of rules from examples, conceptual clustering and hierarchy generation, automatic selection of most relevant attributes, rule editing by an expert, and automatic application of the learned or acquired rules to new cases <ref> (Michalski and Kaufman, 1997) </ref>. Important aspects of the INLEN approach that distinguish it from the most of existing data mining systems are that it employs a wide range of knowledge generation operators and is capable of knowledge-intensive discovery. <p> To this end, we have initiated the development of KGL (Knowledge Generation Language), a metalevel language for specifying knowledge discovery experiments using INLEN operators <ref> (Kaufman and Michalski, 1997) </ref>. Specifically, the language allows the user to create plans of experiments and specify instructions for automatically guiding the system through sequences of steps and contingencies. The language is designed to support writing simple KGL programs that could perform very complex data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. <p> KGL more closely resembles a programming language than a query language in the facilities it offers for flow control. Details about the current implementation of KGL have been described in <ref> (Kaufman and Michalski, 1997) </ref>. An Illustrative Application: Seeking Demographic and Economic Patterns in a Database of World Facts To exemplify the INLEN methodology, we will consider its application to the problem of searching for demographic and economic patterns in a world database.

Reference-contexts: Learning Rules with Structured Attributes In addition to conventional symbolic and numerical attributes, INLEN supports a new kind of attributes, called structured. Such attributes have value sets ordered into hierarchies <ref> (Michalski, 1980) </ref>. In order to utilize structured attributes during inductive learning, new inductive generalization rules have been developed.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate their use, the concept of a knowledge segment was introduced <ref> (Kaufman, Michalski and Kerschberg, 1991) </ref>. A knowledge segment is a structure that links one or more relational tables from the database with one or more structures from the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Such a form may include combinations of descriptions of different types, with a constraint that the end result should be easy to understand and interpret by an expert in the given domain, i.e., the produced descriptions should satisfy the principle of comprehensibility <ref> (Michalski, 1994) </ref>. Our first efforts in developing such a methodology have been implemented in the system INLEN-1 (Michalski et al, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Our first efforts in developing such a methodology have been implemented in the system INLEN-1 <ref> (Michalski et al, 1992) </ref>. The most recent version of the system, INLEN-3, combines a range of machine learning methods and tools with some traditional data analysis operators, in order to provide a user with powerful capabilities for data explorations and derivation of diverse kinds of knowledge from a database.

Reference-contexts: A problem arises in determining the generalization that is most appropriate for the given situation. We approach this problem by drawing insights from human reasoning, namely that people prefer generalizations to certain intermediate levels in a generalization hierarchy <ref> (e.g., Rosch et al, 1976) </ref>, and that the choice of the generalization level is based on the concept typicality and the context in which the concept is being used. To provide a mechanism for capturing such preferences, INLEN allows a user to define anchor nodes in a generalization hierarchy.
