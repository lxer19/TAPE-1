Title: SUPPORTING CHECKPOINTING AND PROCESS MIGRATION OUTSIDE THE UNIX KERNEL  
Author: Michael Litzkow Marvin Solomon 
Address: WisconsinMadison  
Affiliation: Computer Sciences Department University of  
Abstract: We have implemented both checkpointing and migration of processes under UNIX as a part of the Condor package. Checkpointing, remote execution, and process migration are different, but closely related ideas; the relationship between these ideas is explored. A unique feature of the Condor implementation of these items is that they are accomplished entirely at user level. Costs and benefits of implementing these features without kernel support are presented. Portability issues, and the mechanisms we have devised to deal with these issues, are discussed in concrete terms. The limitations of our implementation, and possible avenues to relieve some of these limitations, are presented.
