Reference-contexts: We used simulations to study the performance impact of such a scheme and find that the protocol scales well to large group sizes. With multiple sources, each source consumes its fraction of the control bandwidth for state announcements. Alternatives to equal sharing involve voting based on receiver interest <ref> [1] </ref>. Hierarchical naming provides a framework for hierarchical rate-control among the different containers and internal nodes of the hierarchy. Work on scaling control traffic to extremely large sessions by limiting its scope has received considerable attention in the recent past.

Reference-contexts: In retrospect, a transport protocol like TCP, whose designers adopted the one size fits all approach, has had to be retrofitted against each new type of network technology ranging from wireless <ref> [2] </ref> to satellite links, and each new application, e.g., T-TCP [3] for WWW transport. The ALF or framework approach has been suggested for reliable multicast [12]. While previous work on the scalable, reliable multicast protocol suggested an architecture for a framework-based approach, no comprehensive set of mechanisms was specifically proposed.

Reference-contexts: Other factors that affect the implementation of generalized naming are interactions with SRM archiving agents. We plan to explore this topic with recent experience gained in developing a prototype recorder for SRM streams <ref> [4] </ref>. 10 Summary and Conclusions In this paper, we motivated the need for structured data name spaces, and proposed a heirarchical scheme for data naming. Hierarchical data naming that mirrors application data names can introduce a high overhead if these names are transmitted with every transmission unit.

Reference-contexts: Applications like digital audio, video, and whiteboard are gaining popularity as desktop conferencing tools, as are other emerging applications including webcasting [13], file system multicast, distributed interactive simulation [22], network games <ref> [5] </ref>, etc. All these applications have common requirements scalable, reliable, flexible multipoint communication.

Reference-contexts: ALF pushes this responsibility to the application and the transport protocol can query the application, using upcalls <ref> [6] </ref>, to retrieve the missing data. In order to enable application participation via upcalls, there is a need for a common syntax that both the application and the transport understand. 3 Hierarchical Naming of Application Data Units Hierarchical naming is sufficiently general for most applications of interest.

Reference-contexts: All these applications have common requirements scalable, reliable, flexible multipoint communication. However, each application differs significantly from the other in delay requirements, bandwidth characteristics, ordering guarantees, and degree of reliability. fl This work was supported by ARPA contract BAA 96-06 In an earlier paper, Clark and Tennenhouse <ref> [7] </ref> predicted that numerous, heterogeneous distributed applications would emerge and protocol designers would have to design network protocols with this in mind. Their solution to overcome heterogeneity in applications was to involve the application in protocol decision making, which they called the Application Level Framing or ALF model.

Reference-contexts: We see an improvement of about 20% in delay with this scheme. 7 Related Work There has been a lot of recent and ongoing work in reliable multicast. Several groups have proposed to use a generic naming scheme. Specifically, a recent Internet draft <ref> [8] </ref> on RMFP proposes a two-layered data stream with OIDs and sequence offsets. However, each object simply represents a subsequence of the sequence space. The authors do not describe how objects are discovered by the receivers in the event of a loss.

While previous work on the scalable, reliable multicast protocol suggested an architecture for a framework-based approach, no comprehensive set of mechanisms was specifically proposed.

Although the application and the transport protocol were closely coupled in wb, the implementation lacked a generic framework for light-weight sessions.

Reference-contexts: We plan to move the generalized naming scheme and the SAP protocol into the existing SRM implementation in the MASH shell [17]. We also plan to use it to develop real world applications such as MediaBoard [20], WebCast <ref> [14] </ref>, and floor control applications. The real challenge to using ALF is in designing the right programming interface. Experience with building the vast suite of multimedia and file transfer-type applications that are within the scope of the MASH project can be invaluable in designing the right API.

Reference-contexts: Extensions to the scalable, reliable multicast protocol are discussed in 5. Section 6 presents simulations of the new algorithm under various scaling scenarios. We survey related work in 7 and conclude in 10. 2 ALF and Data Naming In traditional transport protocols such as TCP for uni-cast and RMTP <ref> [15] </ref> for multicast, the data naming is tightly coupled with the error control. A sequence number is the minimum amount of information that is required for error detection and recovery in the absence of any other information from the application.

Reference-contexts: Another, more recent, example of a multicast application that can benefit from application level participation in error detection and recovery is distributed whiteboard application. The LBL wb <ref> [16] </ref> application uses a two-level hierarchy of pages and drawing operations to structure data. In order to enhance scalability, the application participates in error detection and recovery.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we present the methodology and results of simulations. 6.1 Extensions to ns We studied the behavior of SRM in combination with SSAP using simulations. The simulations were written in ns <ref> [18] </ref> written in C++ and Tcl/Tk. At the time we started, ns did not have a built-in reliable multicast module. We implemented SRM with scalable repairs and responses. ns has a split software architecture with objects living in C++ or Tcl/Tk [19] or both. <p> This scheme appears to be inflexible for general applications like file-system multicas-ting. It is also unclear how to map objects into OIDs. 8 Status and Future Work SAP has been implemented and evaluated in the network simulator ns version 2 <ref> [18] </ref>. We plan to move the generalized naming scheme and the SAP protocol into the existing SRM implementation in the MASH shell [17]. We also plan to use it to develop real world applications such as MediaBoard [20], WebCast [14], and floor control applications.

Reference-contexts: The new naming scheme provides a common syntax that both the application and the transport protocol can reason about. To see how hierarchical naming improves expressibility of application requirements and enables application control in protocol functions, consider the case when a MediaBoard <ref> [20] </ref> wants to selectively repair losses on the current active page (s). <p> This feature of MD-5 makes it well-suited for the purpose of representing the tree as a unique (with high probability) fixed length quantity. 2 A problem with long ASCII ADU names is that they in-cur a large per-packet overhead, especially for small packets like those in MediaBoard <ref> [20] </ref>. We propose a solution to this problem in the following sections. 3.2 Container Descriptors Each container is mapped to a fixed length container descriptor and used as an identifier in packets. Explicit bind messages are used to disseminate the mapping information to receivers in the session. <p> We plan to move the generalized naming scheme and the SAP protocol into the existing SRM implementation in the MASH shell [17]. We also plan to use it to develop real world applications such as MediaBoard <ref> [20] </ref>, WebCast [14], and floor control applications.

Reference-contexts: For internal nodes, the signature is computed as a hash function of the signatures of its children. A good example of a hash function that is suitable for this is MD-5 <ref> [21] </ref>. The likelihood of mapping two different trees to the same hash value is vanishingly small.

Reference-contexts: We implemented an SRM Agent module that runs the basic SRM timer mechanisms with suppression and backoff. The naming data structure (k-ary trees, with ASCII labels at each node) was implemented in 4 C++. 3 . The SAP protocol was implemented in OTcl <ref> [25] </ref>, since OTcl is convenient for prototyping various policies. The data for the session was from randomly generated traces. In all our experiments we used one source. Inter-arrival times for session data were picked from a uniform random distribution.
