Title: A Measurement Study of an LRMP-based Webcasting Application  
Author: Zhendong Su, Megan Thomas and Tina Wong

Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California,  
Abstract: We study the behavior of an application, Web-Canal, that implemented a reliable multicast protocol, the Lightweight Reliable Multicast Protocol, LRMP. LRMP was designed for multicasting of WWW documents in a reliable, ordered, scalable fashion. We wrote a simulator and ran around ninety simulations, varying a number of parameters, like group size and loss severities. Our experiments show that the number of control packets LRMP generates scales up with the group size under a variety of network conditions. The selective NACKs of the LRMP protocol do significantly reduce traffic, especially under high loss conditions. We postulate that local recovery would reduce the degree to which LRMP control traffic increases with increasing group size.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The ever-growing popularity of the World-Wide Web has lead to a proliferation of popular new application types. Among these, closely coupled to the Internet multicast capabilities [3] and the growth of "pushed" data (as opposed to the traditional, "pulled" data) is webcasting <ref> [9, 7, 2, 1] </ref>. Webcasting requires a reliable protocol for transporting HTML pages from a source to a potentially large number of receivers. Several such protocols have been proposed [4, 6, 10]. <p> For example, mWeb [9] is a framework to multicast presentations on the MBone. It interfaces with the Netscape browser and multicasts files using the Scalable Reliable File Distribution Protocol, SRDFP, which is a protocol designed to distribute groups of files and their meta-data. Ed Burn's Webcast <ref> [1] </ref> is another framework for sharing web documents over the MBone. It uses the Common Client Interface to interface to the XMosaic browser and the Reliable Multicast Protocol RMP for transmission.

Reference-contexts: Webcasting requires a reliable protocol for transporting HTML pages from a source to a potentially large number of receivers. Several such protocols have been proposed <ref> [4, 6, 10] </ref>. However, while a number of researchers have studied the aggregate performance of multicast traffic [11], performance studies of particular reliable multicast transport protocols in the context of the applications they were designed are few [4]. <p> Several such protocols have been proposed [4, 6, 10]. However, while a number of researchers have studied the aggregate performance of multicast traffic [11], performance studies of particular reliable multicast transport protocols in the context of the applications they were designed are few <ref> [4] </ref>. We study the performance of a particular reliable multicast transport protocol, the Lightweight Reliable Multicast Protocol, LRMP [6]. LRMP was designed with applications that multicast WWW documents in mind. We evaluate LRMP's performance using WebCanal [7], a particular webcasting application that implements LRMP. <p> Section 7 covers future work and Section 8 concludes the paper. 2 LRMP and WebCanal In this section, we describe the protocol details of LRMP, and the webcasting application WebCanal. 2.1 LRMP The Lightweight Reliable Multicast Protocol, LRMP, is a simplification of the Scalable Reliable Multicast Protocol, SRM <ref> [4] </ref>. LRMP was designed to be scalable, lightweight, general purpose while giving reasonable performance. LRMP was not designed with the tight delivery constraints of real-time traffic in mind. Unlike SRM, LRMP provides totally ordered packet delivery and rate-based traffic flow control. LRMP has no local recovery. <p> Bear in mind that the rtt from source to farthest receiver, which is the unit that the recovery delay is given in, will be larger for larger multicast groups. We compared these scalability results with the ones in <ref> [4] </ref>. SRM employs a local recovery algorithm which allows other participants in the session to send repairs, not just the original sender of the packet. This protocol generates a fairly constant number of request and repairs as the session size increases. <p> As explained before, LRMP uses a simple ap loss conditions proach to calculate the timer value. We believe a more adaptive approach, such as the one described in <ref> [4] </ref>, can be used to decrease the number of duplicate requests. 5.3 Sender's Repair Timer How does the sender react to duplicate requests? As explained before, an LRMP sender ignores a request for the same repair packet if it is received within a certain time of the last request. <p> We only talk about a few representatives here. SRM <ref> [4] </ref> is designed to be a highly scalable protocol for reliable multicast over wide area networks. The application that drove this design is the LBL whiteboard which distributes slides in an MBone session.

Reference-contexts: It is intended for multicasting WWW documents from a source to one or more receivers. For the sake of flexibility, there can be more than one active source at once. In order to be portable, it was coded in Java <ref> [5] </ref>. WebCanal acts as an HTTP proxy server, fetching HTML documents using the unicast HTTP protocol, then multicasting the pages out to the receivers using the LRMP multicasting protocol.

Section 3 discusses the methodology of our study. <p> We deduce this result from the burst 8 graphs in which the difference between the slopes of the S-NACK line and the NACK line increase as the burst length increases. 5.5 Reaction to Loss We want to look at how LRMP reacts to high loss conditions. The authors of <ref> [6] </ref> claim that LRMP works well under severe loss rates. The plots for Section 5.1 contain information for this analysis. We see that, for loss rates of 12.5%, 25% and 50%, the delay experienced by the receivers waiting for a repair packet are relatively similar.

Reference-contexts: The conclusion they reach is that SRM performs well for dense sessions, the cases we have simulated, but less well for sparse sessions. It remains future work to investigate how LRMP behaves in sparse sessions. RMTP <ref> [8] </ref> has another approach to providing scalability. It uses designated receivers which are responsible for handling and processing acknowledgments from their subtrees of receivers. This is to limit the scope of local recovery. There are some problems in employing this scheme.

Studies in Spring 1955 <ref> [9] </ref> shown that this protocol is not suitable for wide area network because it uses only global recovery. 7 FUTURE WORK There are a number of aspects of WebCanal and multicast groups that our experiments did not ex 10 plore.

LRMP was designed with applications that multicast WWW documents in mind. <p> We assume that the physical packet delays from each WebCanal host machine within the subnet to the simulator host machine are fairly constant and negligible relative to the large delays the simulator adds. 4 EXPERIMENTS We modeled our experiments after the MBone measurement results in <ref> [11] </ref>. Yajnik, Kurose and Towsley noted that loss near the source in a mul-ticast group was relatively rare. However, such losses are important because they affect every member in the multicast group and could lead to NACK implosion without some sort of NACK suppression.
