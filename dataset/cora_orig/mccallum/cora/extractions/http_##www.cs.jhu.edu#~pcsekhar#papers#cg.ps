Abstract: We provide an efficient algorithm for the rooted binary tree isomorphism problem under the operation of graph minors (restricted version). This arises as a result of corresponding lung volumes during different phases of breathing and in comparing normal and diseased lungs. Given two rooted binary trees T 1 = (V 1 ; E 1 ; W 1 ) and T 2 = (V 2 ; E 2 ; W 2 ) (W 1 ; W 2 correspond to 3D coordinates W 1 ; W 2 : V &gt; R 3 ) as inputs, we want to obtain a one-to-one matching function f of nodes in T 1 to T 2 such that the edges emanating from v 1 in T 1 map to edge-disjoint paths emanating from f(v 1 ) in T 2 . In addition to this topology match, W 1 and W 2 are used to closely match the geometric properties of these trees i.e. the Euclidean proximity of mapped nodes, similar values in edge lengths and angles between adjacent edges. In general, nodes in T 2 can be viewed as a non-uniform displacement (spheres of varying radii) of nodes in T 1 . If we consider only the topology match of T 1 and T 2 (i.e. mapping edges of T 1 to edge-disjoint paths in T 2 without considering W 1 and W 2 ), we provide a O(jV 1 j fl jV 2 j) dynamic programming solution to the existence of function f. This is equivalent to checking if T 1 and T 2 are isomorphic under graph minors. Since there could exist exponential number of distinct trees of T 2 that can be reduced to T 1 under graph minors, we reduce this search space by incorporating the geometric constraints into our matching algorithm. T 1 and T 2 are computed by a two-pass central axis algorithm on lung volumes.

Reference-contexts: This results in more edges in the CAT T 2 . Previous work involved matching patterns containing point sets without looking at tree topology/connectivity information <ref> [1] </ref>. The Hausdorff metric (many-to-one mapping) and the bipartite matching techniques view the nodes in T 1 and T 2 as 3D point sets and do not capture the underlying tree topology.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate measurements, lung tree volumes are reduced to a straight line Central Axis Tree (CAT is the core of the tree). The CAT maintains the topological/branching information of lung volumes and is computed in <ref> [2] </ref>. The airways expand/contract as we breath in/out air and this corresponds to increase/decrease in pressure. Due to the difficulty in image acquisition in Computed Tomography (CT) and the resulting segmentation, we may not obtain small airway branches at low pressures (CAT T 1 ).

Reference-contexts: We assign a cost function which corresponds to difference in Euclidean distance of mapped nodes in T 1 to T 2 to the above dynamic programming algorithm. An assignment of nodes in T 1 and T 2 with minimum cost provides a good tree match <ref> [3] </ref> in our applications. We also have a linear time recursive greedy algorithm [3] which incorporate heuristics like node proximity, similarity in edge lengths and branch angles, number of descendants and height of subtree rooted at a node to match the nodes of T 1 to T 2 . <p> An assignment of nodes in T 1 and T 2 with minimum cost provides a good tree match <ref> [3] </ref> in our applications.

Reference-contexts: that two children of a node say v 1 in T 1 map to edge-disjoint paths starting from f (v 1 ) in T 2 ? We believe that the above problem is equivalent to rooted binary tree isomorphism problem under the operation of graph minors only on T 2 <ref> [4] </ref>. Since the edge contraction operation could destroy the binary nature of T 2 , it is applicable only to the edges on simple paths (nodes with degree 2). Also, edge deletion operation is redundant as it can replaced by a node deletion operation.
