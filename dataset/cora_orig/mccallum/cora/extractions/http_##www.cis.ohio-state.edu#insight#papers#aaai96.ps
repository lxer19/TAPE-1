Abstract: Spatial aggregation is a framework for organizing computations around image-like, analogue representations of physical processes in data interpretation and control tasks. It conceptualizes common computational structures in a class of implemented problem solvers for difficult scientific and engineering problems. It comprises a mechanism, a language, and a programming style. The spatial aggregation mechanism transforms a numerical input field to successively higher-level descriptions by applying a small, identical set of operators to each layer given a metric, neighborhood relation and equivalence relation. This paper describes the spatial aggregation language and its applications. The spatial aggregation language provides two abstract data types | neighborhood graph and field | and a set of interface operators for constructing the transformations of the field, together with a library of component implementations from which a user can mix-and-match and specialize for a particular application. The language allows users to isolate and express important computational ideas in different problem domains while hiding low-level details. We illustrate the use of the language with examples ranging from trajectory grouping in dynamics interpretation to region growing in image analysis. Programs for these different task domains can be written in a modular, concise fashion in the spatial aggregation language.

Reference-contexts: For example, Forbus et al. developed the Metric Diagram/Place Vocabulary (MD/PV) framework for qualitative spatial reasoning (Forbus, Nielsen, & Faltings 1991). Chan-drasekaran and Narayanan proposed a direct analogue simulation of elementary mechanics problem using a diagrammatic representation <ref> (Chandrasekaran & Narayanan 1990) </ref>. In comparison, the spatial aggregation framework comprises multi-layer spatial aggregates with identical computational structure at each layer and focuses on the problem of recovering structures from numerical fields. This paper describes the spatial aggregation language and the development of applications in the style of spatial aggregation.

Reference-contexts: The spatial aggregation mechanism transforms the input field to successively higher-level descriptions by applying a small, identical set of operators to each layer of the spatial aggregates. The spatial aggregation framework grows out of a class of problem solvers, KAM (Yip 1991), MAPS (Zhao 1994) and HIPAIR <ref> (Joskowicz & Sacks 1991) </ref>, that derive their power primarily from perceptual operators on analogue representations, and only secondarily from search and analytical methods. These programs have exhibited expert performance on difficult problems in hydrodynamics, nonlinear control, and engineering mechanism analysis.

Reference-contexts: Merging: Classifies with a tight threshold and then merges similar classes using a higher-level aggregation process. Stabilizing: Compares classifications over a range of thresholds, returning the one that persists over the largest subrange.

The current component library, shown in Table 2, contains basic implementations for each abstract data type and operator. Other component implementations can be built according to the defined specifications and added to the library if necessary.
