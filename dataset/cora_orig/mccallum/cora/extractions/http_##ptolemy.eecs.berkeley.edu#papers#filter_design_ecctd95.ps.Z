Abstract: This paper gives an algebraic framework for designing analog filters that are jointly optimized for magnitude, phase, and step responses, and filter quality. We formulate the design problem as a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) problem and use symbolic mathematical software to translate the SQP formulation into working MAT-LAB programs to optimize analog filters.

Reference-contexts: We formulate the procedure at an algebraic level, and use symbolic mathematical software to generate the code to compute the optimization. We convert the constrained non-linear optimization filter design problem to a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) problem. SQP requires that the objective function <ref> [1] </ref> and the constraints [2] be real-valued and twice continuously differentiable with respect to the free parameters. SQP relies on the gradients of the objective function and constraints. SQP methods have been previously applied to optimizing loss and delay in digital filter designs [3]. Section 2 reviews notation.

Section 2 reviews notation. Section 3 derives a family of weighted, differentiable objective functions to measure the deviation in magnitude response, deviation in linear phase response, filter quality, and peak overshoot of the step response, of an analog filter.

Reference-contexts: We bring the equations for the objective function and constraints together in the symbolic mathematics environment Mathematica, and program it to (1) compute the gradients of the objective function and constraints symbolically, (2) convert the objective function, constraints, and their gradients into MATLAB <ref> [4] </ref> functions, (3) generate a MATLAB script to run the numeri cal optimization. When the designer changes the objective function, our symbolic software will then recompute the gradients and regenerate the numerical optimization code.

Reference-contexts: In order to make the peak overshoot calculation differentiable, this section derives an analytic expression that approximates t peak in terms of the pole-zero locations. This derivation assumes that there are no multiple poles, so some classes of filters are excluded <ref> [5] </ref>.
