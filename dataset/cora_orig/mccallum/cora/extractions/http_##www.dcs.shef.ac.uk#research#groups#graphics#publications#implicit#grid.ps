Title: Speeding Up Grid-Data Generation for Polygonisation of Implicit Surfaces  
Author: Agata Opalach Steve Maddock

Abstract: Implicit surfaces are particularly suitable for design and animation of smoothly blended objects that deform during motion. Such objects change their shape due to external forces, deform during collisions with other objects or conform to their environment. They are also able to squash and stretch, an effect essential in traditional animation yet often lacking in computer animation. However, visualisation of implicit surfaces is not yet achieved at interactive rates. This limits the practical application of implicit surfaces in the area of interactive design and animation. One way of displaying implicit surfaces is to polygonise them and use a fast hardware polygon renderer to create a high quality image. This paper proposes a way of speeding up grid-data generation, one of the phases of the polygonisation process.

Our work [14] describes the ABC of implicit surfaces: appearance, blending and coherence. These three properties are important for character animation with implicit surfaces. In [15] we used implicit surfaces to implement cartoon effects (or traditional animation principles) in a character animation system.
