Abstract: In this paper we study the order statistics of the sojourn times of customers that form a single batch arriving in a M X =M=c queue. We determine the marginal probability density functions of each of the order statistics, the density function of the range and the joint probability density function of all of the order statistics. In addition, we obtain simple upper and lower bounds on the cumulative distributions of the order statistics of the sojourn times. The results in this paper can be applied to modeling parallel processing and fault-tolerant systems. fl The work of this author was partially supported by the Office of Naval Research under Contract N0014-87-K-0796

Reference-contexts: The primary purpose of these studies was to compare this statistic with the sojourn time of a randomly chosen customer. There has been recent interest in the problem of modeling parallel processing behavior. A number of papers <ref> [1, 7, 9, 2, 3] </ref> have studied the behavior of the maximum order statistic for a class of queueing systems referred to as fork-join queues. Here there exist c servers, each with its own queue.
