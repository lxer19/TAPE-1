Abstract: This paper explores Shape from Motion Decomposition as a learning tool for autonomous agents. Shape from Motion is a process through which an agent learns the shape of some interaction with the world by imparting motion through some subspace of the world. The technique applies singular value decomposition to observations of the motion to extract the eigenvectors. We show how shape from motion applied to a fingertip force sensor learns a more precise calibration matrix with less effort than traditional least squares approaches. We also demonstrate primordial learning on a primitive infant mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: Exact formulae relating these parameters can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. Expanding (1) using the double angle formula yields: (2) which can be simplified to (3) if we keep the magnitude of the force constant (easily achieved by using a constant mass on the string). Equation (3) describes one strain gage, the ith gage.

Reference-contexts: This is due to the fact that it is fundamentally of rank two. If it were exactly rank two (no noise), all singular values besides the first two would be zero. It can be shown <ref> [2] </ref> that the best projection of this data onto a two-dimensional space (in other words, the best rank-2 matrix) will be: , (7) 1. padded with zeroes as needed 2. Bad sensor design can also result in degenerate cases.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, the robot is infant-like because it must learn the most basic input/output relationships from scratch. The shape from motion technique is modified to match the principal component analyses of Hancock and Thorpe <ref> [3] </ref> and Pierce [8]. The standard principal components analysis provides a substitute for the geometric constraint used in equation (11). For primordial learning, we do not wish to constrain the problem. <p> For run-time operation, the new sensor image is projected onto the eigenspace as described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Using this technique, the real robot achieved both wandering behavior and escaped stalls and collisions without highly redundant or correlated sensors and with no algorithmic structure imposed on the learned result. would have done on its own with eigenvectors learned on a prior training set.

Reference-contexts: It is successful and robust because it does not rely on first recovering the depth of the objects (which is problematic), nor does it rely on constrained or known motion. Instead, it employs singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref> [4] </ref> to simultaneously decompose the highly redundant image feature data into two matrices. The rank of these matrices is fixed by the number of degrees of freedom of the system and a fixed geometrical relationship between them.

Reference-contexts: In the abstract sense, the matrices just represent a linear mapping of data points; a specification of the structure (shape) and history (motion) of some interaction. 3 Calibration by Shape from Motion The traditional force sensor calibration procedure <ref> [7] </ref> is rather far from the ideal learning scenario. Many known, externally-calibrated forces are applied to the sensor, then corresponding output vectors are gathered, and the input/ output data is reduced by least squares.

We have two small robots that are very simple in construction with minimal, but disparate, sensing and actuation. The subject of this experiment is the MK-V, a three-wheeled, non-holonomic structure with a single drive wheel and an unpowered steering wheel.
