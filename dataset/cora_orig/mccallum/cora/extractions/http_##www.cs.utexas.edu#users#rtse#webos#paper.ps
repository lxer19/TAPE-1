Title: Spanky: A Secure Internet Commerce Protocol  
Author: Raymond Tse, Wenli Wang, Zhigang Liu, Lixin Shou 
Abstract: The goal of this project is to provide a means for the secure purchasing of goods over the Internet. A transaction between a buyer and a seller is secure if the following properties are maintained as necessary within the transaction: authentication, privacy, integrity, non-repudiation, verifiable causality, and atomicity. Electronic commerce protocols that are currently in common use on the Internet are extremely insecure. This paper presents the design and implementation of Spanky, a simple Internet commerce protocol which makes secure transactions possible.

Reference-contexts: This is an important feature that makes Spanky a feasible protocol for transactions in an environment where trust is extremely limited (like on the Internet). Below we analyze the authentication portion of the Spanky protocol using the methods described in <ref> [Burrows, et al. 1989] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, SET only cares about the secure financial information transaction, but Spanky secures the entire online purchase transaction context including contracts and dispute resolution. First Virtual Internet Payment System (FVIPS) provides a confirmation scheme and introduces electronic receipts. <ref> [FVIPS 1998] </ref> The First Virtual Internet Payment System enables secure online transactions using its VirtualPIN, which allows online buyers to make purchases of digital products over the Internet without giving credit card numbers online.

Reference-contexts: We would also like to assume that message digests act as finger prints, such that for a data item d, there is no efficient algorithm to compute d' where MD (d) = MD (d') <ref> [Gouda 1998] </ref>. 5 Analysis of the Spanky Protocol Let us now analyze the Spanky protocol and see why it is secure. When the credit card company sends the credit card and disks to the buyer via postal mail, we assume that no adversary can intercept the package.

Reference-contexts: There are three major types of payments: credit cards involving intermediaries, electronic fund transfers, and digital money. For these protocols, the degree of online processing, security, and performance vary. For credit card transactions, SET and First Virtual are the most well-known. The SET <ref> [SET 1998] </ref> protocol specifies how all members in an electronic transaction - buyers, sellers, banks, and Internet processors - interact to ensure secure Internet payments using credit card information. The SET system substitutes an X.509 certificate for the credit card number and applies RSA encryption for authentication, authorization and confidentiality.
