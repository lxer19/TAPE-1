Abstract: Although the debate between "behavior-based" architectures and "symbol-processing" architectures is now over a decade old, there has been little progress in resolving it. I argue that this is due partly to the tendency of both sides to study only the problems to which their architectures are well suited and partly to the avoidance, again by both sides, of certain deep and difficult issues which I will refer to as the generalized binding problem. I present work in progress on a novel architecture that permits many of the operations of a symbolic architecture, while preserving the structure, efficiency, and parallelism of behavior-based systems. Results are given from a partial implementation that parses natural language sentences in real-time using a set of finite-state machines and answers them using an implemented real-time vision system based on current biological theories. I disucss the extension of this architecture to a general robot-control system.

Reference-contexts: I will therefore refer to them simply as the external and internal binding problems, respectively. To make this claim more plausible, notice that you can trade one for another. Agre and Chapman's deictic representation <ref> [1] </ref> is based in large part on the insight that any solution to the external binding problem is likely to involve the direction of attentional resources, such as tracking units, to the objects of interest.

Reference-contexts: No architecture has been shown to be suitable for both classes of tasks. This has lead a number of researchers to propose hybrid architectures combining behavior-based systems with conventional symbol-processing systems. For example, Bonasso et al. <ref> [2] </ref> propose combining a dynamically reconfigurable array of behaviors with two symbolic reasoning systems. <p> For example, Maes [10] was forced to model the blocks world by using separate behaviors for each possible set of arguments to the move operator. Previous attempts to solve this problem have usually involved either layering a standard reasoner on top of a behavior-based system <ref> [2] </ref> or building a lisp-machine out of neurons or behaviors [15]. An alternative solution is to implement a carefully limited version of binding. Role-passing is such a technique.

Reference-contexts: To the extent that the tracking units can be explicitly directed from one object to another, they themselves act like pointers, so layering another pointer system on top of them is redundant. Similarly, the manipulation subsystem of Connell's Herbert system <ref> [4] </ref> directed to pick up an object by pointing the robot's body at the object rather than passing it an symbolic object-id code. In short, Pengi uses its eyes as pointers, Herbert uses its body. 2 Deictic representation is a way of mitigating the internal binding problem.

Reference-contexts: Temporal-synchrony variable binding [13] allows small numbers of small dynamic structures to be manipulated through a time-domain multiplexing technique. It presupposes phased-locked-loop circuitry whose neuroanatomical reality is highly controversial. Henderson <ref> [5] </ref> has recently shown that TSVB is sufficient to implement a sophisticated description-based parser. Touretzky [15] showed how to emulate a standard lisp engine in a Boltzmann network, thus reintroducing the advantages of von-Neumann processing, but also much of its seriality.

Reference-contexts: From an abstract standpoint, the VRP behaves like a Prolog engine that represents variables as image-plane markers rather than symbolic expressions. It can backtrack and solve arbitrary Horn clauses, subject to certain resource limitations. See <ref> [7] </ref> for a full discussion of the vision system, its control hardware, and its theoretical limitations. Ludwig's vision system is written in C and runs at 5 frames per second on low-cost 7 hardware. <p> The C code simulates a set of parallel processes that compute a set of low-level visual maps, an attention system based on current biological attention theories [8], and a set of visual markers for recording image locations extracted by the attention system (see <ref> [7] </ref>). The rest of the system is implemented directly in (simulated) digital logic: gates, registers, busses, etc. The system is extremely parallel. Parsing, semantic analysis, and visual search execute concurrently in separate pipelines.

Reference-contexts: This had lead to a number of problems. Behavior-based systems have difficulty performing "cognitive" tasks. They also have trouble passing parameters between behaviors. For example, Maes <ref> [10] </ref> was forced to model the blocks world by using separate behaviors for each possible set of arguments to the move operator.

Reference-contexts: A number of other ways of mitigating the problem have been explored. Marker-passing schemes allow certain inference operations to be performed without allocating new graph structure or changing the topology of the existing structure. These schemes have been used increasingly in behavior-based systems <ref> [11] </ref>[10][9]. Mataric's Toto navigation system [11] was notable for dealing with the internal binding problem directly. She implementing a node allocator and a switching network to allow the graph to vary over time as her system learned about new locations in space.

Reference-contexts: The CP implements a set of frames in the sense of the society of mind <ref> [12] </ref>: frames are fixed agencies that can be either active or inactive. They are not data structures that are dynamically cons'ed and GC'ed. Frame roles, such as OBJECT, DESTINATION, ACTOR, etc., can be filled either by the PPs (see below) or by other frames.
