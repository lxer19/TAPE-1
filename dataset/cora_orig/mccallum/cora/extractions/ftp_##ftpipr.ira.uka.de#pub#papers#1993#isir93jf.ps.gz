Abstract: In this paper a control architecture and system is proposed which allows human supervisory for teleoperators in a time delayed environment. The integrated operation concept defines two phases. The first phase is alternatively an automatic or operator driven "preparation" phase, including offline planning facilities with real-time simulation on 3D computer graphics for verification of robust operation sequences. The second one is the "execution" phase, with automatic robot action execution on a sensor based telerobot and if required, operator support for exception handling and recovery. The two phase concept fulfils the requirements for operator controlled "teleprogramming" of external remote devices and solves the problem of transmission time delays of more than one second. The local control system is designed as a hierarchical architecture, where each level is supported by an appropriate programming language and efficient man machine interfaces for operator interaction.

Reference-contexts: The slave in the remote workcell monitors the execution of the instructions and informs the operator on critical situations, when an exception appears. Such developments are often based on the principles of "traded" and "shared" control <ref> [1] </ref>. The task of the telerobot is planned on a local operation station with predictive simulation and a control concept is superimposed, which ensure, that the remote teleoperator is still under full control of the operator, even if there is a time delay.

Reference-contexts: The action language includes sensor based control methods and is designed for the use of force/torque robot controllers and can be classified into six goal dependent classes (Figure 4) <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To build a modular, flexible, and open structured control architecture, we chose as a baseline for the development the Functional Reference Model (FRM), a hierarchical control architecture developed for semi-autonomous telerobotics in space application <ref> [5] </ref>. The proposed architecture is a four layered control architecture with operator oriented implicit mission, task, and action control levels and an explicit execution oriented control level. This explicit level is the interface to the remote active devices, sensors, and experiments.

Reference-contexts: Aspects like human safety, resource efficiency, limited and cost intensive crew availability request to new operation concepts, where "intelligent" sensor-controlled telerobots have to fulfil complex tasks under supervisory control. There is a need to perform maintenance and servicing tasks remotely, even in space applications <ref> [6] </ref>. Autonomous systems are not able to perform robust robot actions, because it is not possible to perform an adequately model of complexity of real-world interactions. Real autonomous systems have to provide and anticipate with complex, preprogrammed corrective actions for multiple error conditions which can arise during a task execution.

Reference-contexts: Several teleoperation systems have been developed in the past. First developments were simple master-slave systems. These systems are often feedback systems with the operator's action, perception and reaction forming a closed loop <ref> [7] </ref>. With the operator in the loop, these direct feedback systems tend to destabilize the human-machine control-loop, whereas time delays are greater than 0.3 sec. In space or under water applications, the transmission time between the local and remote system is more than 1 second.

Reference-contexts: This method improves the completion time of a task in a time delayed environment for about 40% [14]. Hirzinger includes the time delay into the dynamic model of the environment by using sophisticated estimation schemes <ref> [8] </ref>. Recent developments try to combine simple autonomous task execution with exception handling in supervisory control mode. The system only interacts with the human operator when it encounters a situation it cannot handle.

Reference-contexts: In principle, on the remote control side a compliant control strategy based on a constraint concept <ref> [12] </ref> is used to avoid critical situations like increasing of the force and torque during an unforeseen contact with the environment. Half autonomous telerobots stop the execution of the commanded actions in critical situations. Thresholds, for example force/torque (F/T) vectors, are given in addition to the telerobot commands for monitoring.

Reference-contexts: These SCs are defined by sensor primitives (SPs). A SP is an abstract description of the sensor equipment of the telerobot and the testbed. The sensor primitive concept is based on the logical sensor concept <ref> [13] </ref>. Example for an SP: the SP Object Available &lt;OA&gt; gives the information if an object is available during execution of a grapple action.

Reference-contexts: To perform tasks autonomously is a difficult problem even in a well structured environment. Autonomy becomes very costly in situations where the environment is only partially known and significant, sensing and control errors exist <ref> [14] </ref>. To build reliable and flexible systems even for execution in partly known environments, consequently an operator has to be placed into the control loop for system support. This is especially necessary in situations, where the flexibility and cognitive capability of a human operator is needed. <p> They normally work with predictive graphical displays [17] which allow the operator to preview the effects of commanded actions in real-time. This method improves the completion time of a task in a time delayed environment for about 40% <ref> [14] </ref>. Hirzinger includes the time delay into the dynamic model of the environment by using sophisticated estimation schemes [8]. Recent developments try to combine simple autonomous task execution with exception handling in supervisory control mode. <p> The system only interacts with the human operator when it encounters a situation it cannot handle. Paul proposes a "teleprogramming paradigm" that combines a graphical previewing display with the provision of real-time kinesthetic feedback, which is computed on the basis of the operator's interaction with the simulated robot environment <ref> [14] </ref>. The slave in the remote workcell monitors the execution of the instructions and informs the operator on critical situations, when an exception appears. Such developments are often based on the principles of "traded" and "shared" control [1].

Reference-contexts: This is especially necessary in situations, where the flexibility and cognitive capability of a human operator is needed. Effective architectures and systems are required with special skills to fulfil the goals <ref> [15] </ref> and the fundamental objectives of a telerobotic control system. A closed man-machine cooperation to improve the flexibility and effectiveness based on mutual help and supervision has to be organized. Several teleoperation systems have been developed in the past. First developments were simple master-slave systems.

Reference-contexts: Thresholds, for example force/torque (F/T) vectors, are given in addition to the telerobot commands for monitoring. At least, the operator is informed about the remote situation and is asked for help. Exception handling is done with appropriate input/output devices directly on explicit level. In <ref> [16] </ref> a model based system is presented which integrates a programming system, a task execution system, and an error handler with special skill primitives to provide robust autonomous execution.

Reference-contexts: In such systems, this methods are no longer valid. Other approaches are developed, which use sophisticated techniques to overcome the effect of time delay. They normally work with predictive graphical displays <ref> [17] </ref> which allow the operator to preview the effects of commanded actions in real-time. This method improves the completion time of a task in a time delayed environment for about 40% [14]. Hirzinger includes the time delay into the dynamic model of the environment by using sophisticated estimation schemes [8].

Reference-contexts: The modes can be switched back interactively, if the operator support isn't needed any more. In general, we can define three main user interaction types for efficient telerobot programming and control <ref> [19] </ref>: Information retrieval and observation: For this type of interaction, the system should ensure easy access to common information requested by the operator.
