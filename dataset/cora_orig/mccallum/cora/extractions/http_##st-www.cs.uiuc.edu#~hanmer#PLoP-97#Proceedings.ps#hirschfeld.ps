Abstract: You have decided to design your application based at least on a two-tier distribution architecture. One tier holds the resources that may be shared by several clients and another tier holds the clients themselves. Unfortunately sometimes these resources may not provide any facilities to manage the concurrent access to them nor do they provide an interface to take part in a separate concurrency control mechanism.
