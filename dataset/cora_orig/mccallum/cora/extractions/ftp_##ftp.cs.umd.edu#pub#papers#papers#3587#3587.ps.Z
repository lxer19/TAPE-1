Abstract: We study the convergence of GMRES/FOM and QMR/BiCG methods for solving nonsymmetric Ax = b. We prove that given the results of a BiCG computation on Ax = b, we can obtain a matrix B with the same eigenvalues as A and a vector c such that the residual norms generated by a FOM computation on Bx = c are identical to those generated by the BiCG computations. Using a unitary equivalence for each of these methods, we obtain test problems where we can easily vary certain spectral properties of the matrices. We use these test problems to study the effects of nonnormality on the convergence of GMRES and QMR, to study the effects of eigenvalue outliers on the convergence of QMR, and to compare the convergence of restarted GMRES and QMR across a family of normal and nonnormal problems. Our GMRES tests on nonnormal test matrices indicate that nonnormality can have unexpected effects upon the residual norm convergence, giving misleading indications of superior convergence when the error norms for GMRES are not significantly different from those for QMR. Our QMR tests indicate that the convergence of the QMR residual and error norms is influenced predominantly by small and large eigenvalue outliers and by the character, real, complex, or nearly real, of the outliers and the other eigenvalues. In our comparison tests QMR outperformed GMRES(10) and GMRES(20) on both the normal and nonnormal test matrices.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we can estimate the norms of the residuals in GMRES/FOM or QMR/BiCG without computing the true residuals. In finite precision arithmetic, this estimate will still be valid as long as the errors in the recursions are sufficiently small <ref> [1] </ref>. Typically, each of these methods is implemented using recursive factorizations of either the Hessenberg or the tridiagonal matrices, and the preceding estimates of the norm of the residual are obtained recursively and used to track convergence. <p> There are both small and large complex pairs of outliers, two pairs with magnitude 10 4 and 10 2 , and three pairs with magnitudes 25, 55, and 100. The real parts of the other eigenvalues are in <ref> [1; 10] </ref> and the imaginary parts are in [10; 10], all generated randomly in several boxes in the plane. 3. fl bsb2 : The eigenvalues are real and complex. There is a small complex pair of outliers of magnitude 10 2 . There are 3 complex pairs of large outliers.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we study the convergence behavior of these methods using the MATLAB [14] templates discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. In section 2 we review briefly the GMRES/FOM and the QMR/BiCG methods. In section 3 we obtain a relationship between BiCG and FOM, and a weaker relationship between QMR and GMRES. <p> QMR/BiCG/BiCGSTAB (q) In the QMR, BiCG, and BiCGSTAB (q) in <ref> [2] </ref>, v 1 r 0 =kr 0 k = w 1 = ~r 0 =k~r 0 k. <p> We have constructed MATLAB [14] codes which allow the user to generate and regenerate test matrices of the form given in equation (40). The user can also call any of the MATLAB Template codes <ref> [2] </ref> for solving equation (1). See [7] for more details. We note that in QMR/BiCG in [2], ~r 0 = r 0 . <p> The user can also call any of the MATLAB Template codes <ref> [2] </ref> for solving equation (1). See [7] for more details. We note that in QMR/BiCG in [2], ~r 0 = r 0 . If all of the iterates are well-defined, the lower envelopes of the residual norm plots generated by applying GMRES and FOM to any problem track each other [6]. <p> The three singular value distributions considered were as follows. 1. I n : The identity matrix. Used to generate normal problems. 2. a2r2b0 : Obtained by computing the equally spaced points t i , i = 1; : : : ; 48, in the interval <ref> [2; 0] </ref> and setting the singular values i = 10 t i 2 . 3. gr48 : Obtained from the Gcrar matrix of size 48 by applying the MATLAB function EIG to this matrix and then applying the MATLAB function SVD to the eigenvector matrix obtained from EIG. <p> It fits linear GMRES polynomials at each iteration. These tests should be rerun using BiCGSTAB (2) which fits second order GMRES polynomials which can model pairs of complex eigenvalues in real arithmetic [13]. BiCGSTAB (2) was not available in the MATLAB Templates <ref> [2] </ref>. Finally we consider QMR on each of these test problems. See figures 33-36. On these tests, to within error norms of size 10 9 there were no significant differences between the convergence in the normal and the nonnormal cases. <p> It may be possible to construct other unitary V such that and V interact to make the problem more difficult than the matrix alone might indicate. Moreover, we note again that these tests should be rerun using BiCGSTAB (2) which was not available in the MATLAB Templates <ref> [2] </ref>. 7. Summary We derived a relationship between residual norms generated by the BiCG method and residual norms generated by the FOM method.

Reference-contexts: We cannot guarantee that the Galerkin equations are well-conditioned or even nonsingular. If H k is singular for some k, then the k th FOM iterate does not exist but in this situation the k th GMRES iterate is identical to the (k 1) st GMRES iterate <ref> [4] </ref>. For any 1 q n, GMRES (q) is GMRES restarted with the current residual vector, after each q iterations [17]. 2.3. Nonsymmetric Lanczos Methods: QMR/BiCG/BiCGSTAB (q) QMR/BiCG and BiCGSTAB (q) are based upon nonsymmetric Lanczos recursions. Nonsymmetric Lanczos recursions generate two sets of Lanczos vectors, and tridiagonal matrices.

Reference-contexts: See section 5, figures 1-2 for examples of this behavior. We have the following lemma which we will need in section 3. See for example, <ref> [6] </ref>. Lemma 2.1. (Exact Arithmetic). Apply either QMR/BiCG or GMRES/FOM to equation (1). For QMR/BiCG let z Q;B T e k y + kr 0 k^e 1 for some k-vector y denote a corresponding quasi-residual vector. Similarly, for GMRES/FOM define z G;F using H e k . <p> See [7] for more details. We note that in QMR/BiCG in [2], ~r 0 = r 0 . If all of the iterates are well-defined, the lower envelopes of the residual norm plots generated by applying GMRES and FOM to any problem track each other <ref> [6] </ref>. Whenever the residual norms in a FOM plot begin to increase the residual norms in the corresponding GMRES plot must flatten and neither 10 residual norm can improve until the FOM residual norm plot finishes its excursion. <p> Therefore, we do not need to run tests on FOM. A similar relationship exists for the BiCG residual norms and the corresponding QMR quasi-residual norms <ref> [6] </ref>. In practice we observe that until the finite precision errors become dominant, the true QMR residual norms and the QMR quasi-residual norms track each other. Serious deviations between these two norms could be used as a heuristic for estimating when the finite precision limits of convergence have been exceeded. <p> Comparisons of Methods We want to compare the performance of these methods. For large problems it is not feasible to use GMRES, so in this section we consider restarted GMRES. Moreover, in almost all cases, the lower envelopes of the QMR and BiCG residual norms are very close together <ref> [6] </ref>. Because of these similarities we do not include BiCG norms in any of the plots in this section. In this section we consider only GMRES (10), GMRES (20), QMR, and BiCGSTAB.

Reference-contexts: In section 4 we review unitary equivalences for each of these methods and how these equivalences can be used to obtain test matrices where certain spectral properties of the matrices can be varied <ref> [7] </ref>. In section 5 we address the question of consistency when testing a given method across changes in the nonnormality of the problem or in the eigenvalue distribution. <p> In practice users typically monitor estimates of the residual norms to identify convergence and may use true residual norms to verify convergence. Error norms are not available in practice. We obtain the following theorems in <ref> [7] </ref> which identify classes of matrices with identical residual and error norms. From this we obtain a set of test matrices. Details are in [7]. <p> Error norms are not available in practice. We obtain the following theorems in <ref> [7] </ref> which identify classes of matrices with identical residual and error norms. From this we obtain a set of test matrices. Details are in [7]. In this section we use C to denote a matrix and ~ C to denote the matrix U H CU where U is a unitary matrix. Theorem 4.1. (Exact Arithmetic)(GMRES/FOM): Let U be any unitary matrix. <p> If A is normal these theorems imply that in exact arithmetic we can study the behavior of any of these procedures on normal matrices by studying their behavior on diagonal matrices. For arbitrary A we can use the preceding unitary equivalences to obtain the following theorem, <ref> [7] </ref>. Theorem 4.3.

If all of the iterates are well-defined, the lower envelopes of the residual norm plots generated by applying GMRES and FOM to any problem track each other [6]. <p> If we modify b in accordance with the permutation, then permuting either the singular values or the eigenvalues corresponds to some permutation of the columns of V <ref> [7] </ref>. In section 6 we fix V , generating it randomly, using the random number generator RAND and the ORTH routine in MATLAB [14], and we vary and fl b . In each test it is necessary to select either x true or b.

Reference-contexts: In section 6 we use these test matrices in numerical experiments designed to provide some insight into the effects of nonnormality on the convergence of QMR/GMRES, on the effects of outliers on the convergence of QMR, and on the debate over which method is best. In <ref> [8] </ref> we considered similar questions for the eigenvalue problem Ax = x. We use the following notation. 1.1. Notation. <p> Test Matrices Used Each test matrix is defined by equation (40) for different choices of and fl b . V is generated randomly and fixed. All test problems are of size n = 48. In <ref> [8] </ref> we observed that small but nonzero entries in strategic positions in V can affect the convergence of eigenvalue computations based upon either the Arnoldi or 12 nonsymmetric Lanczos recursions. <p> In each test, the corresponding real block diagonal form was used. 1. fl gr48 : All of the eigenvalues are complex. There are no outliers. fl gr48 is the eigenvalue distribution of the Gcrar matrix, n = 48 [20]. For a picture of this distribution see <ref> [8] </ref>. 2. fl asb2 : The eigenvalues are real and complex. There are both small and large complex pairs of outliers, two pairs with magnitude 10 4 and 10 2 , and three pairs with magnitudes 25, 55, and 100.

For details on their construction see <ref> [22, 19] </ref>. 6 2.5. Comments on Both Types of Methods In this paper we use superscripts Q; B; G; F to denote respectively, quantities associated with a QMR, a BiCG, a GMRES or a FOM computation. <p> GMRES and FOM require only A but require access to all of the previously-generated Arnoldi vectors at each iteration. BiCGSTAB (q) also requires only A but since it is based upon BiCG and restarted GMRES, it also has small storage requirements. For details see <ref> [22, 19] </ref>. Theoretically, the recursions underlying GMRES/FOM cannot break down. Theoretically, however, the recursions underlying QMR/BiCG/BiCGSTAB (q) will break down if at some stage in the underlying nonsymmetric Lanczos recursions, a bi-orthogonality term w T v = 0 for some w 6= 0 and v 6= 0.

Reference-contexts: The eigenvalue distributions considered were as follows. In each test, the corresponding real block diagonal form was used. 1. fl gr48 : All of the eigenvalues are complex. There are no outliers. fl gr48 is the eigenvalue distribution of the Gcrar matrix, n = 48 <ref> [20] </ref>. For a picture of this distribution see [8]. 2. fl asb2 : The eigenvalues are real and complex. There are both small and large complex pairs of outliers, two pairs with magnitude 10 4 and 10 2 , and three pairs with magnitudes 25, 55, and 100. <p> The number of QMR iterations required appears to be more sensitive to changes in outliers than to the changes in nonnormality which we use. For additional discussions of the effects of nonnormality on iterative methods for equation (1), see for example <ref> [3, 5, 20] </ref>. 6.3. Outliers and Their Effect on the Convergence of QMR We want to study the effect of different eigenvalue distributions upon the convergence rate of QMR. We consider both normal and nonnormal test matrices.

Reference-contexts: In section 6.3 we observe, as others have observed, that the convergence rate of QMR appears to be correlated with the ability of the procedure to recognize small outliers <ref> [21] </ref>. If V has a nefarious structure which correlates with small outliers, we might expect similar effects upon the convergence of the QMR/GMRES procedures for Ax = b. We do not, however, consider such effects in this paper. Also we do not use any form of preconditioning.

Reference-contexts: The second set of methods is based upon nonsymmetric Lanczos recursions, and includes the bi-conjugate gradient method (BiCG), the quasi-minimal residual method (QMR), and their variants such as BiCGSTAB (q) <ref> [9, 12, 22, 13, 19] </ref>.
