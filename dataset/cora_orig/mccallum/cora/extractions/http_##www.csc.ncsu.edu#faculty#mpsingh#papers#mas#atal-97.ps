Title: A Customizable Coordination Service for Autonomous Agents

Abstract: We address the problem of constructing multiagent systems by coordinating autonomous agents, whose internal designs may not be fully known. We develop a customizable coordination service that (a) takes declarative specifications of the desired interactions, and (b) automatically enacts them. Our approach is based on temporal logic, and has a rigorous semantics and a naturally distributed implementation.

Reference-contexts: Our approach complements the above, because they develop semantic representations, whereas our approach focuses on the activity management infrastructure itself. There is also work on the lower-level aspects of providing robust infrastructures for implementing multiagent systems, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>. We believe this work is important, and can in principle be used to support the kind of approach developed here. High-level abstractions for agents have been intensively studied, e.g., [15]. Formal research on interactions among agents includes [8].

Reference-contexts: Formal research on interactions among agents includes [8]. These approaches develop formal semantics, but do not give as precise an operational characterization. The present work has a formal semantics along with an operational interpretation. There has been much work on social abstractions for agents, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>. We believe that the present infrastructure will facilitate the development of a computational treatment of the social constructs by capturing the mechanics of possible interactions in a succinct manner. Including mental and social abstractions into a generic executable system is an important open problem.

Reference-contexts: The set of events, their properties, and the skeleton of an agent depends on the agent, and is application-specific. The coordination service is independent of the exact skeletons or events used in a multiagent system. Although traditional database approaches, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>, are limited to loop-free skeletons, which correspond to single-shot queries or transactions, we place no such restrictions here. Example 3 discusses two common skeletons in information search. Example 3. Figure 1 shows two skeletons that arise in information search.

Reference-contexts: M r [x sup] initiates Q sup s [x] D4. M eof [x] initiates F s [x] D5. Q sup r [x v] conditionally feeds F s [x]. 3.2 Contract Net Protocol Our approach applies well to higher-level coordination protocols, such as the CNP <ref> [5] </ref>. Briefly, the CNP begins when the manager sends out a request for proposals (RFP); some potential contractors respond with bids; the manager accepts one of the bids and awards the task.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, this service is analogous to truth maintenance systems (TMSs), which are immensely successful because of their simplicity, and enable design of complex systems. Similarly, we do not expect our service to replace more sophisticated approaches <ref> [6, 19] </ref>, but to facilitate their robust implementation. Section 2 motivates and presents our conceptual approach. Section 3 describes our algebra for specifying interactions and uses it to formalize an example from section 2, as well as the contract net protocol (CNP). Section 4 shows how the service operates. <p> Oates et al [14] propose an approach for planning searches. However, their approach does not have an explicit representation of search patterns, and does not apply generically. The search techniques are captured as different search patterns in our approach. Decker & Lesser <ref> [6] </ref> present coordination algorithms in the generalized partial global planning framework. This work is both more and less ambitious than our work. It includes heuristics to reason about deadlines and coordination problems in various situations, but it does not provide a formal semantics.

Reference-contexts: This semantics characterizes progress along a given computation and uses it to determine the decision on each event. Our semantics has important differences from traditional linear temporal logics <ref> [7] </ref>. One, our traces are sequences of events, not of states. Two, most of our semantic definitions are given in terms of a pair of indices, i.e., intervals, rather than a single index.

Reference-contexts: Our service enhances techniques from workflow and relaxed transaction scheduling in databases. It is rigorous, being based on temporal logic. It includes abstractions for (a) a semantics of events in a multiagent system and (b) message passing to implement control and data flow <ref> [9] </ref>. Our approach is distributed and requires only limited knowledge of the agents' behavior. As we show in section 3, our formal language is quite simple. Simplicity and rigor are both crucial: a service should be easy to use and highly reliable.

Reference-contexts: Agents are a result of this marriage. Currently, many agent approaches are centralized in a single agent. However, centralization has obvious shortcomings in accommodating the above properties of open environments. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in multiagent systems <ref> [11, 19] </ref>, which can yield the benefits of intelligent agency while preserving openness and scalability. What sets multiagent systems apart from single agents is that they require the agents to behave in a coordinated manneragents must follow some protocol even to compete effectively. <p> Consider a multiagent approach that uses information agents for each resource <ref> [11] </ref>: Example 2. The search of Example 1 involves querying the bridge agent for the next port, querying a directory agent to find suppliers in the next port, and mapping over the list of suppliers to ask each of their agents about the desired valve.

Reference-contexts: The relevant previous tools for developing multiagent systems are either not formal, are centralized or violate the autonomy of agents. AgenTalk [13] gives a programming environment, but no formal semantics. Kabanza <ref> [12] </ref> adapts a traditional temporal logic for synchronizing agent plans; his approach has a centralized scheduler and violates autonomy by requiring full knowledge of, and modifying, the agents' plans. Traditional temporal logic approaches do not apply here.

Reference-contexts: Determining the coordination requirements on the fly would be an important extension, and would be necessary when the coordination requirements are based on the agents' social commitments [17].

Reference-contexts: One of the enhancements being developed is being able to switch between TCP/IP and CORBA for the underlying functionality. CORBA is important, because it is becoming a de facto standard for lower-level functionality in distributed systems. It provides an event service with notifications and triggers <ref> [16] </ref>, but not a coordination service of the sort we described.

Reference-contexts: If the specifications do not conflict with the autonomy of the agents, then they can be executed in a distributed manner.
