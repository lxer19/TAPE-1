Abstract: We present a new approach to cost estimation of client-server ODBMS applications. Unlike previous approaches, our technique exploits high-level knowledge of the database access patterns of the application. This approach is motivated by the observation that many applications exhibit regularities in their execution arising from the iterative or recursive nature of the program code. We are developing formalisms for modeling execution patterns of application procedures and specifying relationships between patterns, and a method for deriving a cost estimate for a database application from these patterns and relationships.

Reference-contexts: We are not aware of another approach to performance estimation that accounts for locality in a similarly intuitive way. 2 An Example: The OO7 Benchmark The OO7 benchmark <ref> [1] </ref> is an application which uses iteration and recursion to create and access large databases using a small amount of code. In this section we illustrate the idealized application representations mentioned earlier by presenting a description of part of an OO7 implementation.

Reference-contexts: One way to obtain these patterns is to trace a sample "training" run of the application to gather aggregate statistics on the execution of statements, which is similar to an approach used by Tsangaris and Naughton for clustering <ref> [2] </ref>. We assume that there is a data creation phase during which objects are installed in the database, followed by a data access phase during which objects are visited and computations are performed.
