Reference-contexts: We extend the class of allowable global deformations to include a parameterized piecewise bending deformation that ensures constant curvature along the major axis of bending. This definition is inspired from <ref> [1] </ref> and is useful for many natural and man-made objects. The domain of bending is a bounded subspace of the Euclidean space R 3 . This domain is partitioned into three non-intersecting zones: the fixed zone, the bending zone and the relocation zone. The fixed zone remains unchanged during bending. <p> primitive e = (e 1 ; e 2 ; e 3 ) T is given by: s 1 = cos ()(e 1 b 0 1 + sin ()(e 2 e 2 ) 1 ) + 2 s 3 = e 3 : (2) Our definition, versus the one presented in <ref> [1] </ref> allows us to decouple the recovery of the rotation and bending parameters during model fitting.

Clustering techniques are normally applied to feature space, but in certain cases they can be directly applied in image space. When feasible, direct application of clustering algorithms may have advantages over feature space approaches.
