See the examples of citations at the end of this document. Within this template file, use the style named references for the text of your citation. References should be published materials accessible to the public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are easily accessible (i.e. you can give the address to obtain the report within your citation) and may be obtained by any vise 1 .
