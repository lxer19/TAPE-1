Abstract: In a mobile computing environment, efficient allocation of wireless communication channels has a consequential impact on the performance of the system. This paper presents a distributed channel allocation algorithm based on the concept of dynamic channel boundaries. Under this scheme, each mobile service station (MSS) is assigned a contiguous range of channels which is not overlapping with the channel ranges of its neighbors. Boundaries between channel ranges of adjacent MSSs are dynamically adjustable but only through voluntary withdrawals. High efficiency is accomplished by the incorporation of two important features, namely early boundary expansion and need-based boundary redrawing. This algorithm imposes a low message volume on the fixed network. It has short response times to connection requests and achieves high channel utilization under both even and uneven load distributions. Channel utilization can be further improved by allowing a MSS to borrow channels from its neighbors. Results from simulation experiments indicate that this algorithm performs better than other distributed channel allocation algorithms.

Reference-contexts: According to the two-tier principle <ref> [1] </ref>, participation of mobile hosts in distributed algorithms on mobile network systems should be minimized because mobile hosts, supported by batteries, have limited computation and communication power.

Reference-contexts: One of them is a distributed DCA algorithm proposed by Prakash, Shivaratri, and Singhal <ref> [4] </ref>. The other one is a fixed channel allocation algorithm, in which each MSS is pre-assigned one-third of the channels in the spectrum in a conict-free manner and can use only those channels to satisfy channel requests. Hence, no inter-cell communication is required.

Reference-contexts: Efficient allocation of limited wireless channels to mobile hosts is a crucial issue in mobile computing. Many channel allocation schemes proposed in the past, whether implemented in software or hardware <ref> [5] </ref>, are centralized in which a central network switch handles all connection requests and allocates channels to MHs to avoid co-channel interference.
