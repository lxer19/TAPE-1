Otherwise the frequency response, and hence the point-spread function, will be asymmetric if the conventional radially-symmetric regularization method (2) is used, as observed in <ref> [1] </ref>. However, in principle we can eliminate this asymmetry by applying a regularization operator whose frequency response is proportional to w OE (times any power of ae). In practice, for a discrete implementation of the regularization operator the asymmetry should be approximately eliminated. <p> In principle, one can choose a desired resolution, and then read off the appropriate fi 0 from Fig. 9. This value of fi 0 will be proportional to the value of fi that should be used with the modified penalty of <ref> [1] </ref>. The proportionality constant is object independent, so only needs to be determined once for a given geometric system matrix G as described in [1]. The constant depends on the units one uses when defining G and the matrix R ? of [1]. <p> This value of fi 0 will be proportional to the value of fi that should be used with the modified penalty of <ref> [1] </ref>. The proportionality constant is object independent, so only needs to be determined once for a given geometric system matrix G as described in [1]. The constant depends on the units one uses when defining G and the matrix R ? of [1]. For a strip-integral tomographic system G, we normalize the elements of G so that P i g ij = 1, which is count preserving. <p> should be used with the modified penalty of <ref> [1] </ref>.

The constant depends on the units one uses when defining G and the matrix R ? of [1]. For a strip-integral tomographic system G, we normalize the elements of G so that P i g ij = 1, which is count preserving. <p> In this case, careful bookkeeping showed that fi 0 = fi b where is the angular spacing and b is the radial center-to-center spacing of the strip integrals. Using this relationship between fi and fi 0 , we computed the discrete local impulse response using (38) of <ref> [1] </ref> and the corresponding analytical impulse response (9) and plotted the FWHM of the two in Fig. 10, for the case of a rectangular radial blur with FWHM=2 pixels, i.e. S true (u) = S model (u) = sinc (() 2u). <p> pixels FWHM, the resolution of the discrete and analytical impulse responses agree quite well. (For FWHM below 2 pixels, the effects of the discrete pixels apparently yield a slightly greater FWHM than predicted by (9).) Figure 11 displays the analytical PSF (9) and the discrete local impulse response (38) of <ref> [1] </ref> for the case fi 0 = 175, for a tomograph with rectangular strip integrals with two pixel width. <p> There is a nearly affine relationship between the FWHM of l 1 (r) and fi 0 for fi 0 &gt; 5, which may be used to simplify further the table lookup method for relating fi to FWHM described in <ref> [1] </ref>.

LS DESIGN OF PENALTY To yield uniform spatial resolution, we would like a penalty function whose spectrum is w OE ae n , where n is a free design choice. <p> However, now the ae weighting is relevant, and must be considered. IV. FFT SIMPLIFICATIONS If the geometric system response G is approximately space invariant, and if the target penalty R ? is the standard quadratic penalty, then if one uses the modified quadratic penalty of <ref> [1] </ref>, then the local impulse response is approximately given by (38) of [1]. In this important case, one can use FFT's to compute (38) of [1] approximately, thereby eliminating the need for an iterative method to compute (38) of [1]. <p> IV.

The effects of an angularly-dependent weighting were shown to yield an asymmetric point-spread function; such asymmetries were reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. It appears that it may be possible to develop a new modified penalty function that eliminates this asymmetry by incorporating a corresponding angular dependence into the regularizer. For data with Poisson noise, the effective angular weighting will be different for each pixel, but should vary slowly with spatial location.

Reference-contexts: D. Point Spread Function Since the frequency response is radially symmetric for w OE = 1, one can compute the corresponding PSF l 0 (r) using the Han-kel transform <ref> [6] </ref>: l 0 (r) = 2 0 where J 0 is the 0th order Bessel function. We do not know of an analytical form for the Hankel transform of (7), even when S true (u) = S model (u) = 1, but it is easy to evaluate the integral numerically.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is somewhat unsurprising that negative sidelobes are often observed in the PSFs. Not surprisingly, the frequency response (7) is unity near ae = 0, and then typically decreases with increasing spatial frequency. The form of (7) is very similar to a constrained least-squares restoration filter <ref> [7] </ref>, or for an ideal system with S model (u) = S true (u) = 1, to a Butterworth low-pass filter. Typical plots of L 0 (ae) are shown in Figs. 1-4 for the case w OE = 1, which we assume hereafter unless otherwise stated. D.
