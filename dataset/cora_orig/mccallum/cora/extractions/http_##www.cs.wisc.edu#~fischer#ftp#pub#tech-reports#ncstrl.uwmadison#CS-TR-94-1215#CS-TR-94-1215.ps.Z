Title: MCPLIB: A Collection of Nonlinear Mixed Complementarity Problems  
Author: Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris 
Date: July 5, 1994  
Abstract: The origins and some motivational details of a collection of nonlinear mixed complementarity problems are given. This collection serves two purposes. Firstly, it gives a uniform basis for testing currently available and new algorithms for mixed complementarity problems. Function and Jacobian evaluations for the resulting problems are provided via a GAMS interface, making thorough testing of algorithms on practical complementarity problems possible. Secondly, it gives examples of how to formulate many popular problem formats as mixed complementarity problems and how to describe the resulting problems in GAMS format. We demonstrate the ease and power of formulating practical models in the MCP format. Given these examples, it is hoped that this collection will grow to include many problems that test complementarity algorithms more fully. The collection is available by anonymous ftp. Computational results using the PATH solver covering all of these problems are described.

Reference-contexts: Conditions (1c) and (1d) imply that both w and v are 0, so that (1a) reduces to requiring that x be a zero of F . Nonlinear equations are of crucial importance in applications, and examples abound in the literature (e.g. the CUTE problems [3] and the Minpack-2 problems <ref> [1] </ref>). We include in MCPLIB examples of a distillation column model contributed by R. Fletcher and described in [23].

In each city i, there is a shipper who must ship d i units of a commodity to city (i + 3).

In this problem, the firms are differentiated by the characteristics of the analgesic pain relievers they produce, rather than by production costs, while demand is determined by the prices and ingredient lists of the pain relievers.

Reference-contexts: While it is possible to express the discrete time problem without using the x variables, this results in a dense problem. For this reason, the state variables x and y are retained in the MCP formulation. 3.7 An Obstacle Problem - obstacle.gms The obstacle problem <ref> [5] </ref> consists of finding the equilibrium position of an elastic membrane subject to a vertical force f pushing upwards. In our example, we consider a membrane with height v on a domain D := (0; 1) fi (0; 1).

We will assume that the utility function to be maximized in (14) is concave and continuously differentiable.

Solution times given are those reported as the resource usage in the GAMS listing file. Computational results for the models not considered in this section, and comparisons of the PATH solver to other MCP algorithms, are found in [8]. We consider first the optimal control problem described in Section 3.6. This problem can be expressed and solved as both an MCP or a QP; we have taken both approaches in solving this problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we need only solve an MCP in 5 variables, rather than the forty-plus variables in the problem on the links, or the 15 variables in NCP (G). 3.5 Computing an Invariant Capital Stock - hanskoop.gms Hansen and Koopmans <ref> [10] </ref> consider the problem of determining an invariant optimal capital stock. In this problem, an economy is assumed to grow over an infinite number of time periods. The technology (i.e. the production processes which can be run) and the available resources are assumed constant over all time periods. <p> We will not derive here the conditions for a z 0 with a constant optimal growth path, since the motivation for the result is rather lengthy, and the proof is longer still.
