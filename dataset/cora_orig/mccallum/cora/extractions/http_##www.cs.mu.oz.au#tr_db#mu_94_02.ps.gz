Reference-contexts: This 2 is a slight expansion on the case currently known as "portable hosts". Session main-tenance is under study in such places as the IETF Working Group on mobile-IP. This paper is limited to session reestablishment. Most previous and current efforts in this area (see e.g. <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>), when discussing the resolution of updates, conclude that due to continual growth of the Internet, it is impractical (if not impossible) to collect and properly replicate all host routing information.

Reference-contexts: Other research projects that have dealt with similar problems, have relied upon a fairly static set of host-host relationships. X.400 <ref> [5] </ref> and DNS [2] addressing depend upon a distribution of authority for naming, and for hiding the details of the final phases of routing.

Reference-contexts: In the area of IP, this is the session maintenance concept. The three main proposals stemming from the group all rely heavily on hierarchical address structure, and tie addressing closely to routing. The key to the IBM proposal <ref> [6] </ref> is the splitting of address fields in each datagram. Instead of a source/destination address pair, datagrams carry two such pairs, the Home address pair and the Forwarding address pair.
Reference: [7] <author> Ioannidis, J., Duchamp, D., and G. Maguire, </author> <title> IP-based Protocols for Mobile Inter-networking. </title> <institution> Columbia University, </institution> <year> 1991. </year>
Reference-contexts: Datagrams are routed to a host that can map the Home address of the destination mobile host to its current Forwarding address, then "tunnel" the datagram to that Forwarding address for local delivery. The Columbia proposal <ref> [7] </ref> establishes Mobile Support Stations (MSS), equivalent to the Re-addressing Servers of the IBM scheme. These broadcast a beacon advertising themselves for mobile host service. A relocating host responds to the beacon, telling the new MSS which one it used to be served through, and requesting new service.
Reference: [8] <author> Penners, J., and Y. Rekhter. </author> <title> Simple Mobile IP (SMIP). </title> <note> IETF Draft September 1993. </note>
Reference-contexts: An advantage to this scheme is that the beacon method allows dynamic assignment of local IP addresses without having to distribute such information to the rest of the world. The Simple Mobile IP proposal <ref> [8] </ref> relies on the mobile hosts announcing themselves to a Visiting Register (VR-like an MSS or Re-addressing Server) upon arrival in a network. This VR contacts the Home Register for the mobile host, giving the new current location.

Reference-contexts: It consists of lower-layer protocols, and is only relevant for comparison here, rather than as a full-fledged option for our solution. Since most packet networks rely on topology stability during actual communication <ref> [9] </ref>, they tend to favor session reestablishment, and so are analogous to our case. Because of its peer design, packet radio is less dependent upon the hierarchical model than are many other schemes we considered. In effect, there is a flat name space, crossing administrative boundaries.

Reference-contexts: This area has been characterised as: discovering the existence of a network service or resource, locating an appropriate copy of it, and keeping track of information about it to enable recalling it in the future <ref> [10] </ref>. Some of the tools in the area have quickly gained acceptance, and even very large followings (e.g. the archie system). Others are relatively specific in intent and application, thus are falling behind in widespread implementation.

Reference-contexts: Many tools from other "areas" are occasionally placed in this class (e.g. the X.500 Directory), although their real purpose lies elsewhere. Three tools in particular, Prospero, archie, and the World Wide Web, have features of interest. Prospero <ref> [11] </ref> has two areas of relevance, its "distributed directory service" concept, and "name closure". It deals with named objects, and delivers a "global dataset", hiding the specifics of ownership and location.

Reference-contexts: Its method of handling naming in a large network involves a superimposition of hierarchy, where each name must be unique only within its originating domain. Names are then extended to include a locator for finding the object named, which then makes them unique globally. Archie <ref> [12] </ref> also imposes a hierarchy, with archive sites as peers of one another, and archie servers as a class of peers superior to that of archive sites.

Reference-contexts: It presents many problems in common with that of this paper's scenario, such as concurrency of data across servers, use of overhead, discovery of new sites, and scaling. Archie's method of indexing is also of interest. The World Wide Web <ref> [13] </ref> locates "documents". Its method of handling the unique naming dilemma is of interest. Where WWW is particularly valuable is in its method of building up text-lists of sources of information. * routing update timestamps. In a highly dynamic network, routing information will be changing constantly.

Reference-contexts: As replication of data may be accomplished in various ways, with different costs, both "strong" and "weak" guarantees of consistency are considered. "Strong guarantee" in data communications refers to such things as reliable delivery, ordered delivery, and delivery within a specified period of time <ref> [14] </ref>. These services typically require "multiphase synchronous protocols". An example in the area of replicated databases would be the use of the Hesiod nameserver within Project Athena for operating the Kerberos security system, where consistency of password authentication across the campus is critical.

Reference-contexts: This routing is generally done via the exchange of connectivity tables. Where the hierarchy is established this way, some dynamic features may be utilised by the "subordinate" hosts. A couple of concepts of interest are the Most Forward Progress, and Nearest Forward Progress options <ref> [15] </ref>.
