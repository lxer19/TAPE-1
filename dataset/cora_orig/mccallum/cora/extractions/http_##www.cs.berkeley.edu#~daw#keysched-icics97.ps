Title: Related-Key Cryptanalysis of 3-WAY, Biham-DES,CAST, DES-X, NewDES, RC2, and TEA

Abstract: We present new related-key attacks on the block ciphers 3-WAY, Biham-DES, CAST, DES-X, NewDES, RC2, and TEA. Differential related-key attacks allow both keys and plaintexts to be chosen with specific differences [KSW96]. Our attacks build on the original work, showing how to adapt the general attack to deal with the difficulties of the individual algorithms. We also give specific design principles to protect against these attacks.

Reference-contexts: This method seems to defend against related-key attacks. 2.3 CAST CAST is a Feistel cipher whose key schedule uses nonlinear S-boxes <ref> [Ada94] </ref>. 1 The key schedule for 8 round CAST with a 64 bit master key is as follows: (k 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k 8 ) = Master Key (k 0 2 ; k 0 4 ) = (k 1 ; k 2 ; k 3

Reference-contexts: The r-th round subkey, sk r , is XORed into the input of the F function as is conventional for Feistel ciphers. 1 The variant of CAST analyzed here is an older version of CAST, not the CAST-128 that is used in Entrust products and described in Internet RFC 2144 <ref> [Ada97] </ref>. 3 CAST is an interesting example of a cipher designed to resist Biham's ro-tational related-key cryptanalysis, but not differential related-key cryptanalysis.

Reference-contexts: DES), designing this type of key schedule appears to be a subtle and difficult task. Many ciphers' linear key schedules have been shown to be quite weak: we have cryptanalyzed TEA, 3-WAY, and GOST [KSW96], and others have cryptanalyzed LOKI [Knu93a], LOKI91 [Knu93b], Lucifer <ref> [BB93] </ref>, and SAFER [Knu95]. To protect against the known related-key attacks, we propose several attack-oriented design goals. To avoid the "subkey rotation" attacks [Bih94], round subkeys should be generated differently, so that each key bit affects nearly every round, but not always in the same way.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, R. Fleming found a known-plaintext attack on a TEA variant weakened to use a constant c [Fle96]. (His variant also differs from TEA in that the the precedence of addition and XOR are reversed <ref> [Ber97] </ref>, but a modification of his attack will work without this reversal.) 8 Attack Two The second differential related-key attack is very similar in spirit to the first.

Reference-contexts: We emphasize that the attacker knows or chooses the relationship between keys, not the actual key values. These techniques have been developed in <ref> [Knu93b, Bih94, KSW96] </ref>. Related-key cryptanalysis is a practical attack on key-exchange protocols that do not guarantee key-integrity|an attacker may be able to flip bits in the key without knowing the key|and key-update protocols that update keys using a known function: e.g., K, K + 1, K + 2, etc. <p> In Biham's standard key rotation attack <ref> [Bih94] </ref>, we succeed when K 0 j = P j+1 j = 0; : : : ; 63: This condition is achieved by choosing suitable related keys K; K 0 and searching over P 0 ; P 0 0 to find a pair with P 0 0 = P 1 ; <p> We can thus obtain a full 63-round characteristic of probability p = ( 25 32 ) 31 2 11 by repeating a 2-round iterative characteristic many times. This improved attack combines ideas from both Biham's key-rotation attack <ref> [Bih94] </ref> and differential related-key cryptanalysis [KSW96] to break TEA with just 2 23 chosen plaintexts and one related-key query. 3 Prudent Rules of Thumb for Key-Schedule Design There is much overlap between the requirements for strong key schedules and cryptographic hash functions. <p> To protect against the known related-key attacks, we propose several attack-oriented design goals. To avoid the "subkey rotation" attacks <ref> [Bih94] </ref>, round subkeys should be generated differently, so that each key bit affects nearly every round, but not always in the same way. Key schedules should be specifically designed to resist differential related-key attacks.

Reference-contexts: the end, we can recover the entire CAST master key with a total of about 2 17 chosen plaintexts, one related-key query, and 2 48 o*ine computations. 2.4 Biham-DES Biham and Biryukov have suggested strengthening DES against exhaustive attacks by using extra key bits to modify the F -function slightly <ref> [BB94] </ref>. One of their modifications uses 5 key bits to select from 32 possible reorderings of the 8 DES S-boxes. We consider related keys which differ only in those 5 bits, and we apply related-key differential cryptanalysis. <p> We consider related keys which differ only in those 5 bits, and we apply related-key differential cryptanalysis. Specifically, suppose one key uses ordering 15642738 and another uses ordering 75642138 (both are from the 32 suggested reorderings listed in <ref> [BB94] </ref>). The only difference between the two F -functions is that S-boxes 1 and 7 have been swapped.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we can construct a one-round characteristic with probability ( 14 64 ) 2 . This leads to a 13-round iterative characteristic with probability ( 14 64 ) 12 = 2 26 . The differential techniques of Biham and Shamir <ref> [BS93] </ref> will break Biham-DES with 2 27 chosen plaintexts when this special related-key pair is available. If two related keys allow the above attack (i.e. differ only in the key orderings as defined above), we call them partners. <p> However, since SKi and SK 0 i differ only for i &lt; 15, note that P 15 0 = P 15. We define P fl = P 0 fl = P 0 = P , where is carefully chosen to bypass <ref> [BS93] </ref> the key difference SK0 SK0 fl = y entering in the first step of the first round. <p> Therefore, we can apply a standard differential 1R analysis stage <ref> [BS93] </ref> to P 0 and P fl 0 ; one can filter out wrong pairs very effectively, so recovering SK0 should be possible with just one right pair. This double-swiping differential attack finds one subkey byte SK0 with a quartet of differentially related keys and about 88 chosen-plaintext/ciphertext queries.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, DES-X cannot be used in a Davies-Meyer-like hash function construction. This complementation property leads to an attack which requires roughly 2 56+64n trial encryptions when 2 n chosen plaintexts are available <ref> [Dae91] </ref>. Note that Kilian and Rogaway [KR96] have proven that this attack is theoretically approximately optimal when DES is viewed as a black box, so any better (non-related-key) attack would have to take advantage of the internal structure of DES. However, their proof doesn't deal with related-key attacks.

Reference-contexts: In general, when independent 10 round subkeys are in use, the strength of a cipher against related-key attacks will be approximately proportional to the strength of one round standing on its own. Additionally, avoid multiple encryption with independent keys; a construction like <ref> [DK96] </ref> is much more secure. And finally, protocol designers should be aware of related-key attacks. Key-exchange protocols should exchange a short master key rather than exchanging expanded keys. Design tamper-resistant devices so that it is not possible to change the subkeys without such changes being detected.

To protect against the known related-key attacks, we propose several attack-oriented design goals. <p> Key schedules should be specifically designed to resist differential related-key attacks. And, when related-key queries are cheap, the master key should be long enough to avoid generic black box attacks, as the key length is effectively halved under these attacks <ref> [WH87, KSW96] </ref>. Avoid dead spots; ensure that every key bit is about equally powerful in terms of its effect on the round keys. Beware of equivalent representations, for they can expose new avenues of attack to an adversary. Our analysis of 3-WAY bears witness to this recommendation. <p> Avoid independent round subkeys. It has commonly been assumed that a cipher's key length (and strength) can be increased by allowing round keys to be specified independently, but we have shown that this dramatically lowers the cipher's resistance to related-key attacks <ref> [KSW96] </ref>. In general, when independent 10 round subkeys are in use, the strength of a cipher against related-key attacks will be approximately proportional to the strength of one round standing on its own. Additionally, avoid multiple encryption with independent keys; a construction like [DK96] is much more secure.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, to avoid equivalent keys, key schedules should possess some form of collision-freedom; collision-freedom is a standard hash function property as well. Finally, it should not be possible to produce controlled changes in the round keys. The key schedules of Blowfish [Sch94] and SEAL <ref> [RC94] </ref> were designed according to this principle. One should typically avoid generating round subkeys as a (fixed, public) linear transformation of the seed. While some cryptosystems have successfully incorporated linear key schedules (e.g. DES), designing this type of key schedule appears to be a subtle and difficult task.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, to avoid equivalent keys, key schedules should possess some form of collision-freedom; collision-freedom is a standard hash function property as well. Finally, it should not be possible to produce controlled changes in the round keys. The key schedules of Blowfish <ref> [Sch94] </ref> and SEAL [RC94] were designed according to this principle. One should typically avoid generating round subkeys as a (fixed, public) linear transformation of the seed. While some cryptosystems have successfully incorporated linear key schedules (e.g.

Reference-contexts: We have to multiply the earlier estimate by 0:775 0:5, obtaining a total probability of 2 29:4 for our characteristic. With this technique, RC2 can be broken with one related-key query and about 2 34 chosen plaintexts. 2.6 NewDES NewDES <ref> [Sco85] </ref> is a 17-round 64-bit block cipher with a 120-bit key. The key schedule is simple: each cycle (which consists of 2 rounds) uses 56 bits from the key and then shifts the key by 56 bits.

Reference-contexts: NewDES succumbs to standard rotation related-key techniques: it can be broken with 2 32 known plaintexts, one related key, and about 2 56 o*ine trial encryptions. When informed of this attack, Scott modified the NewDES key schedule to resist rotational related-key cryptanalysis <ref> [Sco96] </ref>. NewDES-1996 in turn falls to differential related-key cryptanalysis.

Reference-contexts: Thus we can recover all 15 key bytes (K0; : : : ; K14) = (SK0; : : : ; SK14) and completely break NewDES-1996 with total complexity of about 24 related-key probes and 530 chosen plaintext/ciphertext queries. 2.7 TEA TEA <ref> [WN95] </ref> is a Feistel block cipher with a 128-bit master key, K [0::3], and a simple key schedule: odd rounds use K [0; 1] as the round subkey, and even rounds use K [2; 3]. <p> The designers of TEA mention that 32 Feistel rounds (i.e. 16 cycles) may be enough, though they recommend using 64 rounds (32 cycles) <ref> [WN95] </ref>. TEA admits several related-key attacks which arise from the severe simplicity of its key schedule. Attack One For a differential related-key attack, consider the effect of simultaneously flipping bit 30 (the next most significant bit) of K [2] and K [3].

Reference-contexts: If the operator then corrected the rotor positions and retransmitted the same plaintext, an adversary would have a single plaintext encrypted in two related keys [DH79]. Hash functions built from block ciphers can also be vulnerable to a related-key attack against the block cipher <ref> [Win84, RIPE92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Key schedules should be specifically designed to resist differential related-key attacks. And, when related-key queries are cheap, the master key should be long enough to avoid generic black box attacks, as the key length is effectively halved under these attacks <ref> [WH87, KSW96] </ref>. Avoid dead spots; ensure that every key bit is about equally powerful in terms of its effect on the round keys. Beware of equivalent representations, for they can expose new avenues of attack to an adversary. Our analysis of 3-WAY bears witness to this recommendation.
