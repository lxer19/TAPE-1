Abstract: In this paper we investigate the possibility of translating continuous spoken conversations in a cross-talk environment. This is a task known to be difficult for human translators due to several factors. It is characterized by rapid and even overlapping turn-taking, a high degree of co-articulation, and fragmentary language. We describe experiments using both push-to-talk as well as cross-talk recording conditions. Our results indicate that conversational speech recognition and translation is possible, even in a free crosstalk environment. To date, our system has achieved performances of over 80% acceptable translations on transcribed input, and over 70% acceptable translations on speech input recognized with a 70-80% word accuracy. The system's performance on spontaneous conversations recorded in a cross-talk environment is shown to be as good and even slightly superior to the simpler and easier push-to-talk scenario.

Reference-contexts: Target language generation is done using GenKit, a unification-based generation system. With well-developed generation grammars, GenKit results in very accurate translation for well-specified ILTs. The JANUS Phoenix translation module <ref> [4] </ref> is an extension of the Phoenix Spoken Language System [6]. It consists of a parsing module and a generation module.

Reference-contexts: The two modules can run separately or can be combined to gain the strengths of both. The GLR module is composed of the GLR* parser [2][3], the LA-Morph morphological analyzer and the GenKit generator. The GLR* parser is based on Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. GLR* skips parts of the utterance that it cannot incorporate into a well-formed sentence structure. Thus, it is well-suited to domains in which non-grammaticality is common. The parser conducts a search for the maximal subset of the original input that is covered by the grammar.

The JANUS Phoenix translation module [4] is an extension of the Phoenix Spoken Language System <ref> [6] </ref>. It consists of a parsing module and a generation module. Unlike the GLR method which attempts to construct a detailed ILT for a given input utterance, the Phoenix approach attempts to only identify the key semantic concepts represented in the utterance and their underlying structure.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Below, we describe the JANUS system <ref> [7] </ref> and show its application to the problem of the translation of conversational dialogues in a cross-talk environment. Switching the recording conditions from push-to-talk to cross-talk creates several complicating factors, making the task more difficult, yet also more realistic.
