Title: An Algorithm for First Order Regression

Affiliation: Institut "Jozef Stefan"  
Abstract: An algorithm is presented for the induction of first-order logic concepts that incorporate real-valued variables. The algorithm enables use of background knowledge in intensional form, modelling of dynamic systems (learning from time series), partitioning of the attribute space to subspaces to find a regressional submodel for each subspace separately, and handling of noisy data. An outline of the algorithm and the results of its application in some artificial and real-world domains are presented. Real-world domains comprise modelling of the behavior of water in surge tank and modelling of the operator's behavior during the process of electrical discharge machining.

Reference-contexts: prior knowledge of the "absolute value" function (its usage was necessary for GoldHorn) can be considered as an important achievement. 4.2 Electrical Discharge Machining In electrical discharge machining (EDM), the workpiece surface is machined by electrical discharges occurring in the gap between two electrodes | the tool and the workpiece <ref> [1] </ref>. The process consists of numerous monodischarges generating a crater-textured surface. There are three kinds of pulses associated with the monodischarges: A (empty), B (effective), and C (arc) pulses.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is implemented in a machine learning system called Fors (First Order Induction System) <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Fors Algorithm A model produced by Fors is a Prolog program consisting of the background knowledge and the clauses of the form: f (Y,V 1 ,V 2 ,: : :,V n ) :- literal 1 , : : : , literal n , !.

Reference-contexts: The domain expert <ref> [3] </ref> qualitatively defined the relation between the effectiveness of the process and the control parameters | gap and flow. The state of the process is presented in two dimensions on Figure 1. The diagram defines two states of the process: stable state and arcing state.

Reference-contexts: According to domain expert <ref> [4] </ref>, the most important criterion of model quality is : : , so he regards our induced model as a success.

Reference-contexts: is - 0.0530 * H - 3.8490 * _3,!. 4.1.2 Expert's Evaluation The best theoretically derived model of the tank was known to be h = 0:05608 h 3:75771 _ hj _ hj: We will now evaluate the induced model and compare its performance with the model induced with GoldHorn <ref> [5] </ref> and with the performance of the best known model (the "correct" model). Performance of the correct model will be estimated because even the correct model does not reproduce the system's behavior perfectly.

Reference-contexts: In our experiment the same data was used as in experiments with Bacon <ref> [6] </ref>. Fors was presented with the data for the six planets known at Kepler's time. Background knowledge consisted of predicates enabling square root and multiplication. <p> Gas equation describes the relation between pressure of the gas (p), its temperature (T ), volume (V ), and quantity in moles (N ). The data were again the same as used in Bacon <ref> [6] </ref>. Multiplication and division were enabled through background knowledge. Use of linear regression was also permitted. Several learning sessions were performed. The best model induced in the series of learning sessions was: f (V,T,N,P) :- divide (_9,N,P), times (_21,T,_9), V is 2272.60839844 * _9 + 8.31997681 * _21,!.

Reference-contexts: During the induction Fors uses a covering approach similar to the one used in Foil <ref> [7] </ref>. The algorithm repeatedly constructs a clause. When a clause is found, all examples covered by the clause are removed from the training set, and the procedure is repeated while there are enough examples left. The clause building part uses a top-down approach.
