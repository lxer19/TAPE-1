Abstract: In tasks requiring sustained attention, human alertness varies on a minute time scale. This can have serious consequences in occupations ranging from air traffic control to monitoring of nuclear power plants. Changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum accompany these fluctuations in the level of alertness, as assessed by measuring simultaneous changes in EEG and performance on an auditory monitoring task. By combining power spectrum estimation, principal component analysis and artificial neural networks, we show that continuous, accurate, noninvasive, and near real-time estimation of an operator's global level of alertness is feasible using EEG measures recorded from as few as two central scalp sites. This demonstration could lead to a practical system for noninvasive monitoring of the cognitive state of human operators in attention-critical settings.

Reference-contexts: 10 Hz the error-sorted spectral surfaces at low error rates are relatively flat, in contrast to previous JUNG ET AL.: ESTIMATING ALERTNESS FORM THE EEG POWER SPECTRUM 5 results on subjects performing a similar auditory task with eyes closed <ref> [9] </ref>. This suggests that alpha frequencies (8-12 Hz) may be of relatively little use for error rate estimation in subjects whose eyes are open. <p> We refer to the results as forming a correlation spectrum. Since most spectral variance in the error rate time series for this task occurs at cycle lengths longer than 4 minutes <ref> [9] </ref>, we smoothed the EEG power and error rate time series using a non-causal 93.4-s bell-shaped moving-average filter to eliminate variance at cycle lengths shorter than 1-2 minutes. <p> At high error rates, a modest negative correlation also appears near 10 Hz. In an earlier study using the same auditory detection task, where subjects kept their eyes closed <ref> [9] </ref>, the spectral correlation between performance and EEG power contained a prominent negative correlation in the alpha frequency range. This negative peak was not found in the present experiments in which subjects performed with eyes open. <p> However, for maximal accuracy the estimation algorithm should be capable of adapting to individual differences in the mapping between EEG and alertness. IV. ESTIMATION OF ALERTNESS An earlier study <ref> [9] </ref> of alertness estimation based on a similar auditory detection task used linear regression to estimate the time course of local error rate from changes in EEG power at five pre JUNG ET AL.: ESTIMATING ALERTNESS FORM THE EEG POWER SPECTRUM 6 set frequencies. <p> the full EEG spectrum, we compared the results of error-rate estimation using linear regression on the full log spectrum, reduced to four principal factors, with results of linear regression on EEG power at five frequencies previously shown to be correlated to error rate (3.1, 9.2, 13.4, 19.5, and 39 Hz) <ref> [9] </ref>. PCA-reduced full log spectra resulted in lower mean rms estimation error across 20 training-testing pairs (rms error 0.1633 versus 0.2008). Analysis of variance showed this difference to be highly significant across subjects (F (1; 9) = 197:9; p &lt; 0:001). <p> Therefore, in further comparisons, we used the full EEG log spectrum as input, rather than a subset of pre-selected frequencies. B.3 Advantage of Using Two EEG Channels A previous investigation using a similar paradigm <ref> [9] </ref> applied linear regression models to the EEG power spectrum at single scalp channels to estimate alertness. In this study, we first compared the results of using log spectral data from two channels (Cz, and Pz/Oz) against results of using data from either channel alone. <p> For each network architecture, the time course of error rate was estimated five times, using different random initial weights in the range [-0.3,0.3] for each of the 20 training- testing session pairs. Results of neural network estimation were then compared to those using linear regression models <ref> [9] </ref>. The nonlinear adaptability of multi-layer perceptrons significantly improved estimation performance over linear regression, reducing the rms error on the testing data across subjects (F (1; 9) = 6:370; p = 0:03, Table II ). <p> Our results show that accurate, individualized alertness estimation using neural networks applied to EEG spectral data appears realistic. Results of neural network estimation using the full EEG spectrum compare favorably to previous results using a linear regression model applied to EEG power at preselected frequencies <ref> [9] </ref>. The practical potential of EEG-based alertness estimation is suggested by the relative accuracy of EEG-based estimates compared to those of the best a priori models.

Reference-contexts: Any further accuracy increase from using more principal factors was outweighed by the additional computational expense and noise introduced into the model. This result confirms a recent finding of Makeig and Jung <ref> [22] </ref> who showed significant correlations between the first four eigenvectors of EEG spectral variance and alertness on the same detection task. In further model comparisons, therefore, we used four principal components as input.

Reference-contexts: Once an estimator has been developed for each operator, based on limited pilot testing, the method uses only spontaneous EEG signals from the operator, and does not require further collection or analysis of operator performance. Also, unlike proposed methods based on event-related potentials <ref> [23] </ref>, [24], [25], our method avoids introducing potentially distracting probe or secondary-task stimuli into the operator's environment. Several important issues remain to be resolved before practical alertness monitoring systems can be implemented.
