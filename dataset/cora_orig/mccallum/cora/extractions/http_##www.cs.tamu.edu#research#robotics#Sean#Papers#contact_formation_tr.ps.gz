Abstract: The efficiency of the automatic execution of complex assembly tasks can be enhanced by the identification of the contact state. In this paper we derive a new method for testing a hypothesized contact state using force sensing in the presence of sensing and control uncertainty. The hypothesized contact state is represented as a collection of elementary contacts. The feasibility of the elementary contacts is tested by solving a linear program. No knowledge of the contact pressure distribution or of the contact forces is required, so our method can be used even when the contact forces are statically indeterminate. We give a geometric interpretation of the contact identification problem using the theory of polyhedral convex cones. If more than one contact state is feasible, we use the geometric interpretation to develop a computational approach to determine the likelihood of each feasible contact formation. The utility of the approach is illustrated by examples.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will assume that the list of possible contact formations is determined by Xiao's algorithm. One way of reducing the number of initial possible contact topologies is to reduce the uncertainty in the location of the polyhedral object.

This method minimizes the determinant of the generalized position covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: Since the kinematic constraint equation associated with each contact effectively reduce the dimension of C-space, algorithms for motion planning in the presence of contact are potentially more efficient than general motion planning algorithms which do not allow contact <ref> [3] </ref>. The identification of different contact topologies is usually accomplished by a hypothesize-and-test procedure. First, based on the location of the robot and a geometric model of its environment, a set of possible contact formations is identified [29]. These contact formations are then tested using active sensing.

Reference-contexts: Different approachs have been suggested for monitoring and detecting the errors in the execution of motion plans. The change in the contact state between the robot and its environment is the most commonly used method for monitoring the progress of the execution of the motion plan. The contact formation <ref> [6] </ref> is defined as the set of elementary contacts describing a particular contact state. In fact, the different contact formations represent milestones against which the progress of the plan can be measured. <p> This method minimizes the determinant of the generalized position covariance matrix. The method of Caglioti could be used before applying Xiao's method thus reducing the number of contact topologies to be tested by active sensing. The earliest work in sensor-based recognition of contact formations was done by Desai <ref> [6] </ref>, who introduced the concept of contact formation. He also developed a procedure for identifying the contact formations based on force measurements in the presence of uncertainty. In case the contact formations could not be disambiguated by the static test, an active test based on separation cones [6] was used. <p> done by Desai <ref> [6] </ref>, who introduced the concept of contact formation.

In case the contact formations could not be disambiguated by the static test, an active test based on separation cones [6] was used. While Desai's procedure yields satisfactory results for a single contact point, it requires a knowledge of the contact pressure distribution for more general contact formations, which in practical applications is not accessible. To overcome this problem Desai assumed a uniform pressure distribution. <p> The feasibility of these equations can be tested by formulating a LP similar to those discussed above. 12 7 Contact Formation Likelihood In certain situations, it is possible to have more than one feasible contact formation. Desai <ref> [6] </ref> proposed moving the workpiece in directions that correspond to the edges of separation cones. By comparing the new contact formation with the previous set of feasible contact formations, certain contact formations can be eliminated from that set.

Reference-contexts: Uncertainties are inevitable and, if not modelled, can cause the planned motion to fail. Uncertainty has been handled primarily in two different ways. One approach is to generate motion plans that are guaranteed to succeed in the presence of uncertainty. The other approach introduced by Donald <ref> [7] </ref> is to plan motion plans that are not necessarily guaranteed succeed but have the capability of monitoring and detecting an error in the execution of the plan and recovering from that error. This approach, known as Error Detection and Recovery (EDR), greatly extends the range of possible motion plans. <p> Assumption 4 is used by the hypothesis phase of the contact identification algorithm but it may be removed by discretizing the continuous region of geometric uncertainty in the model of the environment. This approach is very similar to the approach used by Donald <ref> [7] </ref>. The last assumption does not exclude uncertainty in the location of robot. The uncertainty in the location of the robot is handled by the first phase of the contact formation identification algorithm: the hypothesis phase.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this problem Desai assumed a uniform pressure distribution. The uniform pressure assumption is usually not valid and a more general model of contact pressure should be used <ref> [15] </ref>. Another shortcoming of Desai's work is that in the case of multiple contacts it is easy to get statically indeterminate cases. In those cases, the contact forces can not be uniquely computed.

Reference-contexts: The position and orientation of the robot are specified. The first two assumptions are commonly made in analyses of robotic manipulation systems and experimental results support their validity [5]. The third assumption is supported by experimental results and calibration data <ref> [21] </ref>. Assumption 4 is used by the hypothesis phase of the contact identification algorithm but it may be removed by discretizing the continuous region of geometric uncertainty in the model of the environment. This approach is very similar to the approach used by Donald [7]. <p> The only assumption we make is that the magnitude of error of each component of the sensed force and moment is bounded and that these bound is known. Those bounds on the sensing error can be obtained from actual calibration data <ref> [21] </ref>. Consider Figure 3. Let S be the force sensor internal coordinate frame. Let C be a coordinate frame attached to the object's center of gravity and aligned with the world frame W. For the rest of this paper we use "generalized force" to imply force and moment. <p> The probability density functions of the components of ffig C can be obtained from those expressions and the sensed force error statistics <ref> [21] </ref>. For a given sensed force ^ g C we define a discrete set F of cardinality N by: F = fxjx = ^ g C + ffig C g (48) F is a set of possible actual forces.

Reference-contexts: In those cases, the contact forces can not be uniquely computed. The work presented here does not assume any particular pressure distribution nor does it require the computation of the contact forces. Spreng <ref> [22] </ref> developed a method for the identification of contact topology based on position/orientation sensing and using motions for verification. A drawback of this method is that it requires a mechanical motion to verify the contact topology.

Reference-contexts: One shortcoming of this work is that it uses the concept of "reciprocity" which is only valid for frictionless systems. Su <ref> [23] </ref> developed a framework for computing the propagation of spatial uncertainty. A key element of Su's framework is the use of contacts to update spatial uncertainty information. However, the contact formation must be identified before the contact information is used to update the spatial uncertainty. <p> However it is very difficult to calculate the probability of a certain region over a general multivari-ate distribution. One way of overcoming this difficulty is to use the Bonferroni inequality <ref> [23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The nonlinear inequality (30) corresponds to a friction cone which can be approximated by an m sided inscribed pyramid.
