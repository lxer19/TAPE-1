Abstract: It has previously been shown that there exists a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that is considerably worse than nested dissection in terms of fill-in and operations for factorization [1]. This paper proves the existence of a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that has the same optimal asymptotic order complexity for fill-in and operation count as nested dissection. The analysis is verified by showing exact match between analytical prediction and experimental measurement. The analysis motivates a peripheral preordering strategy for use with the popular multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm, and is shown to consistently reduce fill-in and operation count for regular grids. Keywords: Sparse Matrices, Finite Element Grids, Minimum Degree Ordering, Computational Complexity.

Reference-contexts: A similar analysis for the minimum degree algorithm does not exist in the literature, though Berman et al. have shown that a particular way to resolve ties results in a worse than optimal ordering for torus graphs <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we consider the ordering problem for a system of equations associated with a regular n fi n grid M , where M has a node at each grid-point (see Figure 1). <p> George et al. [6] have shown 5 that the difference between the best and worst minimum degree ordering of a regular grid can be as much as a factor of three in terms of work required for factorization. Berman et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that for a sparse matrix of size n fi n whose graph is a torus, there exists a tie breaking strategy with a fill-in larger than n log 3 4 and number of induced arithmetic operations larger than n 1:5 log 3 4 .

Reference-contexts: It is optimal for those matrices whose graphs are trees, since it introduces no fill. However, for general sparse matrices, the tie breaking strategy can have a significant impact on the resultant ordering, in terms of fill-in and operations required for factorization <ref> [2, 3, 6] </ref>.

It is referred to as the multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm. <p> It proceeds by choosing the node with minimum degree as the next node to be eliminated.

Reference-contexts: It is referred to as the multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm. Another popular heuristic for ordering sparse matrices is the nested dissection [5] algorithm, which permutes the matrix into a bordered block diagonal form, such that the zero off-diagonal blocks suffer no fill-in during the factorization process. George <ref> [4] </ref> showed that for complete nested dissection of regular nfin finite-element grids, the fill-in introduced by nested dissection can be identified precisely and is O (n 2 lgn). Further, the operation count for factorization is O (n 3 ).

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that the problem of determining a minimum-fill ordering is NP-complete [10]. Several ordering heuristics have been proposed in the literature, the more popular being the minimum degree and the nested dissection algorithms. The minimum degree algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> repeatedly chooses a node with minimum degree as the next candidate for elimination.

Reference-contexts: George [4] showed that for complete nested dissection of regular nfin finite-element grids, the fill-in introduced by nested dissection can be identified precisely and is O (n 2 lgn). Further, the operation count for factorization is O (n 3 ).

Reference-contexts: Thus for regular grids, peripherally preordered MMD seems to be the preferable ordering strategy with respect to total work and storage requirements. Also, for highly unstructured sparse matrices, it has been empirically determined that a nested dissection strategy results in excessive fill and work <ref> [8] </ref>. For example, with a number of matrices derived from the domain of circuit simulation, the operation count with ND was one to two orders of magnitude larger than that with MMD [8]. <p> sparse matrices, it has been empirically determined that a nested dissection strategy results in excessive fill and work <ref> [8] </ref>. For example, with a number of matrices derived from the domain of circuit simulation, the operation count with ND was one to two orders of magnitude larger than that with MMD [8]. The peripheral preordering and distance-based tie-breaking strategies for MMD are very promising in the context of such irregular sparse matrices.
