Abstract: SDC Level-1 calorimeter trigger simulation studies and implementation ideas are discussed. Background trigger rates and efficiencies of triggering on various high p T physics processes are presented. Some of the technical challenges in implementing these simple trigger algorithms in a high rate environment are also explored.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The SDC detector <ref> [1] </ref> is designed to study high p T physics in 40 TeV center mass proton-proton collisions at the SSC Laboratory. It observes 10 8 events per second, while the rate of interesting hard scattering physics, and the capacity of data archival facilities, is about 100 events per second. <p> widely dispersed regions of the calorimeter. 5 Level-1 Trigger efficiency for sample high p T processes In order to better determine the algorithms needed for satisfying the primary high p T physics goals of SDC experiment, we have simulated triggers for several processes studied in the SDC technical design report <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to study efficiencies for these processes, we have divided the level-1 output bandwidth amongst various triggers in a realistic scenario. The total rate of 100kHz was reduced by a safety factor to three to take into account the uncertainties on the calculated rates.

Reference-contexts: It observes 10 8 events per second, while the rate of interesting hard scattering physics, and the capacity of data archival facilities, is about 100 events per second. The trigger system <ref> [2] </ref> must provide this reduction in data rate, while not sacrificing the interesting physics. In order to achieve that rate reduction, the trigger is divided into three levels, each of which use the best algorithms and technology feasible for the volume of data handled at that level. <p> For the implementation studies we are considering a trigger with all the algorithms studied above. 6 Technical challenges in implementation SDC Level-1 trigger <ref> [2] </ref> (See Figure 3) is envisioned to be a crate based system housed outside the detector hall in a surface level control room. The digital signals from calorimeter and other subsystems are expected to be transmitted to the trigger system on gigabit-per-second fiber optic links.

Reference-contexts: In all about a hundred thousand events were generated and put through our simulation program. Minimum bias events, corresponding to 1.6 events per crossing at the nominal SSC luminosity, were separately generated, and added to these events. Our SDC detector simulation program <ref> [3] </ref> used a simplified calorimeter geometry description and its parameterized response. Tracking detector response was only implemented as a p T threshold curve, which was obtained from a separate detailed simulation of the SDC outer tracker [4].

Transport of particles through the detector was performed using nominal magnetic field of the SDC central solenoid. All particles were tracked up to the face of the calorimeter. Those particles with large enough lifetimes, to decay in flight, were decayed, and the remnants were tracked.

Reference-contexts: the solid circles are for sums of E t in 0:8 fi 0:8 non-overlapping calorimeter regions, the open squares are for 0:8 fi 0:8 overlapping regions, and, the open triangles are for total transverse energy in calorimeter up to jj &lt; 3:0. 4 Jet trigger rates and efficiency Jet trigger <ref> [5] </ref> rates and efficiency turn on curves are shown in Figures 2a and 2b for various ranges of energy sums. The trigger based on sum of EM and HAC transverse energy deposits within 0:8 fi 0:8 non-overlapping regions of the calorimeter is deemed to be sufficient for our purpose.

Reference-contexts: The primary challenges in implementing such a large sytem are thus in controlling bit error rate and demonstrating that compact packing of multiple channels in transmission and receiver boards is attained for a reasonable cost. R&D work <ref> [6] </ref> using the Hewlett-Packard G-Link chipset has demonstrated that such a system is feasible with bit error rates of less than 10 13 Hz. Further R&D is underway [7] to demonstrate that a fiber link system is feasible for trigger data transmission.
