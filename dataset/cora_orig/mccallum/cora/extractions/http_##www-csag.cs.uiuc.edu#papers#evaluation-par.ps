Title: An Evaluation of Planar-Adaptive Routing (PAR)

Abstract: We explore the performance of planar-adaptive routers for two, three, and four-dimensional networks. Under non-uniform traffic loads, the planar-adaptive router significantly outperforms the dimension-order router, while giving comparable performance under uniform loads. With equal resources, the planar-adaptive router provides superior performance to fully-adaptive routers because it requires less resources for deadlock prevention, freeing resources to increase the number of virtual lanes.

Reference-contexts: The designated in-order traffic is delivered in sequence, while the other packets arrive in unspecified order. In all cases, the planar-adaptive networks are both deadlock and live-lock free. Extended features of planar-adaptive routing such as fault-tolerance and in-order transmission are described in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we focus on the performance of the basic planar-adaptive router in multi-dimensional meshes (k-ary n-cubes without wraparounds). We assume wormhole routing [4] throughout the paper. In the following sections, we first briefly describe the planar-adaptive routing (PAR) algorithm.

Reference-contexts: We focus on minimal routers because they do not waste any effort. Minimal routing schemes typically prevent deadlock by restricting the routing algorithm <ref> [2, 8, 7] </ref>. A minimal adaptive routing scheme described by Lin-der and Harden [9] allows fully adaptive routing while preventing deadlock.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the hardware complexity of their fully-adaptive router raises practical questions concerning the network clock rate and latency achievable. Dally and Aoki have described an adaptive routing algorithm based on the notion of "dimension-reversals" <ref> [3] </ref>. Each dimension-reversal is a departure from dimension-order routing. Their dynamic scheme can support an arbitrary number of dimension-reversals by tagging each message a dimension-reversal count and terminating adaptive routing if blocked by a packet with a lower number of reversals.

Reference-contexts: The virtual channel requirements for Dally and Aoki's scheme are omitted as they depend on the number of dimension reversals permitted reversal counts and making routing decisions on that basis may increase router complexity significantly. Recent work <ref> [10] </ref> proposes another mechanism, prohibiting certain turns, for providing deadlock-free routing. In many ways, the basic idea is similar to planar-adaptive routing limiting adaptivity to prevent deadlock. Thus far, the technique has been studied primarily in two-dimensional networks.
