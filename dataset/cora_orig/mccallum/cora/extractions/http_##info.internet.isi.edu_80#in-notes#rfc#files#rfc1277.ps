Reference-contexts: This RFCdefines mechanisms to encode addressing information within Network Addresses, in order to support this type of working. In particular, support is defined for RFC 1006 mapping of COTS onto TCP/IP and COTS mapped onto X.25 (1980) <ref> [RC87, CCI80] </ref>. Where an OSI application is run over CLNS on the internet, the NSAP Guidelines of RFC 1237 should be followed [CGC91]. This document must be read in the context of ISO 8348 Addendum 2 [ISO87b].

The OSI Directory, and any OSI application utilis-ing the OSI Directory must be able use these Network Addresses to identify end systems. Currently, OSI applications are often run over lower layers other than the OSI Network Service.

Reference-contexts: The projects were: * The THORN project, which is an Esprit Project building an OSI Di rectory [SA88]. * The ISODE project [Ros90], and in particular the QUIPU directory being developed at UCL <ref> [Kil88] </ref>. The proposal has been implemented, and the viability of the solution demonstrated. 2 Problem Statement When utilising the OSI Directory, the OSI location of an End System will be determined by a Network Address, which is taken from a Presentation Address, looked up in the OSI Directory.

In general, these systems need to be interconnected by the use of transport bridging or application relaying. Operation of transport bridges causes a number of problems which it is desirable to avoid.

Reference-contexts: Two formats for the remainder of the DSP are then defined, for specific means of providing COTS. Hardcastle-Kille Page 5 RFC 1277 Encoding Network Addresses November 1991 A decimal abstract encoding is defined for the DSP. The ECMA 117 format might have been used, but it is not suitable. <ref> [TC386] </ref>. Use of a binary encoding, with the DSP structured in ASN.1 would have been a very attractive approach. However, there is insufficient space in the Network Address for this to be feasible. The following structure is defined: Digit 1-2 3-27 Meaning Prefix Network Specific 2 digits Prefix.
