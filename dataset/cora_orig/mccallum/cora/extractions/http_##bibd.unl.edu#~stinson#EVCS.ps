Abstract: An extended visual cryptography scheme, EVCS for short, for an access structure ( Qual ; Forb ) on a set of n participants, is a technique to encode n images in such a way that when we stack together the transparencies associated to participants in any set X 2 Qual we get the secret message with no trace of the original images, but any X 2 Forb has no information on the shared image. Moreover, after the original images are encoded they are still meaningful, that is, any user will recognize the image on his transparency. The main contributions of this paper are the following: * A trade-off between the contrast of the reconstructed image and the contrast of the image on each transparency for (k; k)-threshold EVCS (in a (k; k)-threshold EVCS the image is visible if and only if k transparencies are stacked together). This yields a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of (k; k)-threshold EVCS for the values of such contrasts. In case a scheme exists we explicitly construct it. * A general technique to implement extended visual cryptography schemes, which uses hypergraph colourings. This technique yields (k; k)-threshold EVCS which are optimal with respect to the pixel expansion. Finally, we discuss some applications of this technique to various interesting classes of access structures by using relevant results from the theory of hypergraph colourings.

Reference-contexts: They analyzed the case of a (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes, in which the secret image is visible if and only if any k transparencies are stacked together. Further results on (k; n)- threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 16] </ref>. <p> Further results on (k; n)- threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 16]. The model by Naor and Shamir has been extended in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> to general access structures (an access structure is a specification of all qualified and forbidden subsets of participants) and general techniques to construct visual cryptography schemes for any access structure have been proposed. <p> This grey level is interpreted by the visual system of the users as black or as white in according with some rule of contrast. We recall the formal definition of VCS proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, which is an extension of [13]. Definition 2.1 Let ( Qual ; Forb ) be an access structure on a set of n participants. <p> We characterize the admissible region for the relative differences ff F (m) and ff S (m) and for any pair of values in this region we show how to construct a (k,k)-threshold EVCS with those relative differences. The following lemma has been proved in <ref> [1] </ref>; we repeat its proof here for the reader's convenience. We will use it in our constructions for extended visual cryptography schemes. With ffi we denote the operator "concatenation" of two matrices. <p> If there exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; m)-VCS constructed using basis matrices then there exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; m + d n k1 e)-EVCS. Results on VCS for threshold access structures can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and [13]. The next corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 6.2 and [13, Lemma 3]. Corollary 6.3 Let ( Qual ; Forb ) be an (n; n)-threshold access structure. Then there exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; 2 n1 + 2)-EVCS. <p> It is obvious that the chromatic number of any bipartite graph is equal to two. Also, it was shown in <ref> [1, Theorem 7.5] </ref> that there is a ( Qual ; Forb ; 2)-VCS if ( Qual ; Forb ) is the strong access structure with basis K a;b . Applying Theorem 5.2, the following result is obtained.

However, we can make use of some known results to get upper bounds and/or exact values of for some interesting classes of access structures. As well, for "small" access structures it is not too difficult to compute the chromatic number.

Reference-contexts: Even if we restrict our attention to graphs, the situation is not much better, as it is NP-complete to determine if a graph has chromatic number equal to three. It is NP-hard even to compute an approximation of the chromatic number of a graph. In fact, recently in <ref> [10] </ref> it has been proved that for some * &gt; 0 it is NP-hard to approximate the chromatic number of graphs with n vertices by a factor of n * .
