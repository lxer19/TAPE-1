Reference-contexts: Thus, when the stream is stored on the server, the I and P frames are stored in multiple resolution. On a ff, the server would retrieve and transmit I and P frames with reduced resolution. However, to keep the resolution unchanged at the client, up-sampling hardware (such as <ref> [1] </ref>) needs to be used at the client side. We believe that in order to keep the network bw requirements during ff under control, a combination of these techniques will have to be employed. mpeg does have implications on the data layout schemes used at the server.

Reference-contexts: However, designing a server which offers dv services and meets all the requirements mentioned earlier is a challenging task. Our (mars) project uses dv service as an underlying model and attempts to meet this challenge. The basic mars architecture has been detailed in <ref> [2] </ref> and here, we will briefly present a prototype implementation that is relevant for the rest of the paper. 3. A Prototype Architecture cell switched atm interconnect, storage nodes and the central manager. <p> The control block, the heart of the array controller, can be a finite state machine or an embedded processor that runs a small real-time executive (or a real-time os). Additional details on the storage node and a scalable extension of the prototype architecture can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.

Reference-contexts: However, though these ideas have been demonstrated to be useful, disk arrays will not be able to support a large number of clients with aggregate throughput of the order of few Gbps [15]. Also, though very high throughputs have been demonstrated in disk arrays developed for supercomputers and mainframes <ref> [3, 19] </ref>, they are expensive custom solutions designed for applications very different from multimedia applications. * Multimedia data is amenable to striping: The periodic nature of multimedia data is well suited to spatial distribution or striping.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 illustrates various service models that are possible for an on-demand storage server. Of these, the shared viewing and dedicated viewing models have been discussed in literature, whereas the shared viewing with constraints model is a generalization of a service commonly known as "near-video" <ref> [14, 4] </ref>. Note that this classification is based on the degree of personalization and interactivity provided by a service. Shared Viewing (sv) service: In this type of service, the time of access for a multimedia document is decided by the server rather than the client.

Reference-contexts: One of the greatest hurdles in designing high performance storage servers that meet all above requirements stems from the persistent storage i/o bottleneck. The primary reason for such a bottleneck is that the processor, memory and network speeds keep improving faster than that of online secondary storage <ref> [5] </ref>. The mismatch between the requirements of multimedia and the traditional operating system support for secondary storage devices aggravates this bottleneck even further. Given these observations, addressing the challenge of high performance storage i/o will be critical to the design of multimedia clients and servers.

Reference-contexts: The other type, commonly used to characterize distributed computing and transaction processing applications, requires very frequent but small data accesses [22]. However, measurements on the first raid prototype at the University of California, Berkeley revealed poor performance and less than expected linear speedup for large data transfers <ref> [6] </ref>. The excessive memory copying overhead due to interaction of caching and dma transfers, and restricted i/o interconnect (vme bus) bandwidth were cited to be the primary reasons of poor performance. Also, it is recognized now that large raid disk arrays do not scale very well in terms of throughput.

Reference-contexts: The performance analysis of a large-scale server using such a scheme has been analyzed in <ref> [8] </ref>. * Sequence variation (SVS) scheme: In this scheme, the operation changes the sequence of frame display and hence the sequence of data retrieval and transmission at the server.

Reference-contexts: The atm based interconnect uses a custom asic called ATM Port Interconnect Controller (apic) currently being developed as a part of an arpa sponsored gigabit local atm testbed. The apic is designed to support a data rate of 1.2 Gbps in each direction <ref> [9] </ref>. The central manager is responsible for managing the storage nodes and the apics in the atm interconnect. For every media document, it decides how to distribute the data over the storage nodes and manages the associated meta-data information.

However, it is aimed at the pc based clients and is not very scalable. Little et al. [17] develop a workstation based non-scalable video server. Their main emphasis has been on metadata database and a video browser.

This implementation is clearly not scalable for large number of users and for high bandwidth streams such as hdtv. Tobagi et al. [30] report a small scale pc-at and raid based video server.

Reference-contexts: Salem et al. [28] represents some of the early ideas on using disk arrays and associated data striping schemes to improve effective storage throughput. Observing that large disk arrays have poor reliability and that small disks outperform expensive high-performance disks in price vs. performance, Patterson et al. <ref> [22] </ref> introduced the concept of raid. A raid is essentially an array of small disks with simple parity based error detection and correction capabilities that guarantee continuous operation in the event of a single disk failure in a group of disks. <p> One type, representative of supercomputer applications such as large simulations, requires infrequent transfers of very large data sets. The other type, commonly used to characterize distributed computing and transaction processing applications, requires very frequent but small data accesses <ref> [22] </ref>. However, measurements on the first raid prototype at the University of California, Berkeley revealed poor performance and less than expected linear speedup for large data transfers [6].

Reference-contexts: Clearly, B frames cannot be transmitted independently and cannot be used as a reference frame. Empirical evidence shows that depending upon the scene content, I to Large Scale Multimedia Servers 17 P frame variability is about 3:1, whereas P to B frame variability is about 2:1 <ref> [23] </ref>. These properties have serious implications for ff 1 . First, a ff sequence obtained by skipping constant number of frames, can contain only I and/or P frames and no B frames.
