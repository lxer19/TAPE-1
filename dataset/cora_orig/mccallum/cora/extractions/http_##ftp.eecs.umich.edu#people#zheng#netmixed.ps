Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, real-time communication has been receiving considerable attention <ref> [1, 2] </ref> because of its increasing need in such applications as packetized voice/video communications, computer-integrated manufacturing, and real-time control systems. In a real-time system, each time-constrained packet generated by the source station must be received by the destination station within a specified amount of time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, real-time communication has been receiving considerable attention <ref> [1, 2] </ref> because of its increasing need in such applications as packetized voice/video communications, computer-integrated manufacturing, and real-time control systems. In a real-time system, each time-constrained packet generated by the source station must be received by the destination station within a specified amount of time. <p> This is based on the observation that for applications like packetized voice/video communication, a certain amount of packet loss is tolerable and a packet which is not successfully delivered within a certain time limit is considered lost <ref> [2] </ref>. The best-effort communication may be acceptable for voice/video applications but may cause a serious problem if the packet to be transmitted is an actuation/control signal. The second category deals with the so-called hard real-time communication problem, in which all time-constrained packets are required to be delivered before their deadlines.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is practically important to address the problem of maximizing the guaranteed throughput for non-time-constrained packets while meeting the delivery deadlines for time-constrained packets, which is the subject of this paper. Several researchers reported different ways of setting parameters in LAN protocols to meet various service requirements <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. Among these, the method proposed by Jaya-sumana et al. [3] is the most closely related to the problem stated above. <p> Several researchers reported different ways of setting parameters in LAN protocols to meet various service requirements [3, 4, 5]. Among these, the method proposed by Jaya-sumana et al. <ref> [3] </ref> is the most closely related to the problem stated above. <p> This part of the work is somewhat similar to that of <ref> [3] </ref>, but possesses the following two notable differences: * We are concerned with the problem of maximizing the guaranteed throughput for non-time-constrained packets while satisfying the requirements of time-constrained packets. <p> As will be explained later, this assumption is less restrictive than the one used in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Section 3 shows the ways of tuning IEEE 802.4 and FDDI protocols. A new, optimal protocol is presented and evaluated in Section 4. Performances of different protocols are compared in Section 5. The paper concludes with Section 6. 3 As was defined in <ref> [3] </ref>, a network is said to be partially symmetric if the traffic of a given class is symmetrically distributed among the devices generating that class of traffic but need not be present at all the network nodes. 4 2 Problem Formulation We shall study a class of medium access protocols called <p> To achieve this goal, certain assumptions must be made about the class A traffic. The authors of <ref> [3] </ref> made the following assumption: A0: If the token visits each station at least once every D A units of time, then the time needed for a station to transmit all its class A packets generated since the token's last visit to the station is less than/equal to a constant T <p> In some other protocols, like the IEEE 802.5 and FDDI, a station is allowed to transmit a packet only if the transmission can be completed before Timer1 expires. Thus, the exact performance of the system depends on the distribution of packet lengths. Jayasumana et al. <ref> [3] </ref> attempted to analyze this exact performance. Let t 0 A and t A denote the maximum and mean values of the time needed to transmit a class A packet. <p> The criterion used for the comparison is the guaranteed throughput for class B packets as shown in Theorem 1 and Theorem 3. The first example uses the normal IEEE 802.4 token bus configuration <ref> [3] </ref>: bandwidth of the bus = 10 Mbit/s, number of stations N = 50, length of the token = 184 bits, one way propagation delay = 5:0s, token passing time = 83:5s. We assume the required access delay for class A packets D A = 20ms.

Reference-contexts: The packets transmitted by a station are seen (possibly after certain amounts of delay as in a ring network) by all other stations in the network. Thus, every station knows how long every other station takes to transmit packets. Most of the existing token-controlled medium access protocols <ref> [6] </ref>, such as the IEEE 802.4 token bus, the IEEE 802.5 reservation-based token ring, and the FDDI timer-based token ring, are TTPs. So, the definition of TPP is quite general. <p> This shows that our optimal TPP is quite insensitive to the distribution of class B packets. The second example uses the normal FDDI token ring configuration <ref> [6] </ref>: effective bandwidth of the ring = 100 Mbit/s, number of stations N = 1000 with a 200 kilometer ring, length of the token = 22 symbols, token passing time = 2s. We assume the required access delay for class A packets is D A = 20ms.

Reference-contexts: Together with the assumption that f k is set to be f k T R T A , the proof of (i) follows. 13 To prove (ii), we use a simplification of the FDDI protocol as proposed in <ref> [7] </ref> in which the transmission time of class B packets is restricted by maxf0; T R T g instead of maxf0; T R T 0 g (see Fig. 2). <p> Thus, we proved that the guaranteed throughput for the standard FDDI is upper bounded by U B 802:4 . 2 The simplified version of FDDI can be implemented by resetting Timer2 at the time a station captures the token no matter whether the token is late or not. In <ref> [7] </ref>, it was claimed that the simplified FDDI guarantees sufficient responsiveness and capacity for the transmission of class A traffic, and it may provide improved responsiveness to class B transmissions. The proof of the above theorem supports this claim.

Reference-contexts: In addition to providing as much throughput for class B packets as possible, it is sometimes desirable that the network provides fairness to class B traffic <ref> [8] </ref>. In other words, if all stations have many class B packets to transmit, each station should have equal throughput for class B packets. <p> If we set T R (m) = D A T A +T A (m) in our optimal token passing protocol, i.e., resetting Timer2 at the time when a station receives the token instead of when a station passes the token, it can be proved in the same way as <ref> [8] </ref> that the protocol provides fairness to class B traffic. The modified optimal TPP continues to provide a higher throughput for class B packets than IEEE 802.4 since T R (m) D A T A still holds.
