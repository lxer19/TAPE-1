Abstract: This paper presents a new communication service for ATM networks that provides one-way, adjustable rate, on-demand communication channels. The proposed dynamic flow service is designed to operate within a multi-service cell switched network that supports both conventional switched virtual circuits and IP packet routing and is designed to complement those services. It is particularly well suited to applications that transmit substantial amounts of data (a few tens of kilobytes or more) in fairly short time periods (up to a few seconds). Much of the current worldwide web traffic falls within this domain. Like IP packet networks, the new service permits the transmission of data without prior end-to-end connection establishment. It uses a variant of ATM resource management cells to carry dynamic flow setup information along with the data, including an IP destination address and burst transmission rate. Switches along the path select next an outgoing link dynamically using the burst rate to guide the routing decision. The dynamic flow setup protocol is based on soft-state control and is designed to facilitate the use of buffers that are shared across all ports of a switch, minimizing per port memory costs.

Reference-contexts: To match the bandwidth of the switch in <ref> [2] </ref>, each burst store requires a memory bandwidth of about 1 gigabyte per second. This can be achieved using eight synchronous DRAM chips with 16 bit data and 16 ns cycle times. Assuming 4 Mb chips, this yields 4 MB per burst store.

Reference-contexts: They propose setting up multiple virtual circuits and reserving bandwidth prior to data transmission by either sequentially or in parallel, sending reservation requests along the different paths. Cidon, Rom and Shavitt [4] also make the case for routing flexibility and in <ref> [3] </ref> describe methods for obtaining such routing flexibility on one-way reservation algorithms, using multiple established virtual circuits. The dynaflow service described here, eliminates the requirement for prior establishment of a fixed number of paths, eliminating the associated control overhead and providing more flexible route selection. 2.

Reference-contexts: An example design for the control complex is shown in Figure 4. This design uses a two port ATM network interface capable of gigabit data transfer rates <ref> [5] </ref>. Here, the second port is used to link the two multiprocessors together, providing a low latency path for the exchange of status information. There is a variety of possible ways to distribute the dynaflow processing among the different processors.

Reference-contexts: The variations are simply too great, and attempting to force individual virtual circuits to conform to population averages, as ATM usage parameter controls seek to do, is counter-productive. The use of rate-based congestion control mechanisms <ref> [7] </ref> can be helpful in this regard, but these mechanisms are only effective for data bursts that have a duration that is many times the round-trip delay associated with a given virtual circuit.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, the protocols require end-to-end reservation, while others operate in a contention mode with reservations made on-the-fly. Because the bandwidth reservation is made over established virtual circuits, there is no opportunity to dynamically select the route on a burst basis, as advocated here. Suzuki and Tobagi <ref> [9] </ref> show that this lack of routing flexibility can limit statistical multiplexing efficiency when the peak transmission rate is a substantial fraction of the link rate.
