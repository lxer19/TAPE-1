Reference-contexts: 1: Adiabatic switching Adiabatic switching <ref> [1] </ref> is a new approach for building low-power digital CMOS systems. It is based on the adiabatic charging principle, which allows circuit switching speed to be directly traded-off against energy dissipation. <p> However, as was also observed by Younis and Knight [5], it is possible to efficiently deliver the charge via a sinusoidal waveform using an inductor. Theoretically, the energy dissipation is then increased to <ref> [1] </ref>: , (2) R E DISS P T I 2 R T CV - R T T 2 T E DISS x RC -CV 2 = x 8 An Energy-Efficient CMOS Line Driver Using Adiabatic Switching William C. Athas, Jeffrey G. Koller, and Lars J. <p> In general, it can be shown <ref> [1] </ref> that for a cascading of N such circuits for which the parasitic capacitances are neglected, the total energy dissipation depends on the charging time as: (3) Thus the dependence asymptotically approaches with increasing N, even though this asymptote is rarely approached in practice because of the relatively large effect the <p> To show that the adiabatic switching principles can be used in practical circuits, and to verify the reduced energy dissipation experimentally, we have designed, fabricated, and tested a simple adiabatic line driver chip (ALDC) <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a circuit using adiabatic switching allows a large part of the signal energies to be returned to the power supply. Such energy recovery in electronic circuits is a familiar principle in high-efficiency power supply design <ref> [2] </ref>, and has also been used in other electrical engineering domains such as drivers for electroluminescent displays [4].

Reference-contexts: Such energy recovery in electronic circuits is a familiar principle in high-efficiency power supply design [2], and has also been used in other electrical engineering domains such as drivers for electroluminescent displays <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper presents an application of the same principle to a simple logic circuit. 2: RLC switching To take advantage of the gains offered by adiabatic charging, not only the logic circuitry but also the power supply must be designed with adiabatic operation in mind.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, we do not know how to deliver and recover energy at constant current without dissipating more energy in the supply which provides the constant current source. However, as was also observed by Younis and Knight <ref> [5] </ref>, it is possible to efficiently deliver the charge via a sinusoidal waveform using an inductor.
