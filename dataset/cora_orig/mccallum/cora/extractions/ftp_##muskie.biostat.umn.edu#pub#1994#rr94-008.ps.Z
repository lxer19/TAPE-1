Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Convergence Diagnostics: A Comparative Review  
Author: By Mary Kathryn Cowles and Bradley P. Carlin 
Abstract: A critical issue for users of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution. Mary Kathryn Cowles is Assistant Professor of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115. Bradley P. Carlin is Associate Professor, Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455. Much of the work was done while the first author was a graduate student in the Divison of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota and then Assistant Professor, Biostatistics Section, Department of Preventive and Societal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198. The work of both authors was supported in part by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases FIRST Award 1-R29-AI33466. The authors thank the developers of the diagnostics studied here for sharing their insights, experiences, and software, and Drs. Thomas Louis and Luke Tierney for helpful discussions and suggestions which greatly improved the manuscript.

Reference-contexts: Then a sufficient number of subsequent iterations must be run to obtain the desired precision, as given by the NSE. Geweke's method attempts to address the issues of both bias and variance. It is available in the CODA package <ref> (Best, Cowles, and Vines, 1995) </ref>. Like Gelman and Rubin's convergence diagnostic, Geweke's is essentially univariate, but if g ( qq ) were taken to be -2 times the log of the posterior density, then it also might be used to investigate convergence of the joint posterior. <p> Table 2 presents the results of running an S-Plus implementation of Raftery and Lewis's method on these five chains for the parameter X 2 <ref> (Best, Cowles, and Vines, 1995) </ref>. The three sets of columns correspond to values of q equal to 0.025, 0.25, and 0.50 respectively. In all cases, r = 0.01, s = 0.90, and d = 0.001. <p> Instead, we now find ourselves recommending a twostage process, wherein model specification and associated sampling are separated from convergence diagnosis and subsequent output analysis. In fact, one of us has codeveloped a collection of 36 S-Plus routines called CODA <ref> (Best, Cowles, and Vines, 1995) </ref> for the second stage of this process, with the first stage being accomplished by BUGS, the recently-developed software package for Bayesian analysis using Gibbs sampling (Thomas et al., 1992; Spiegelhalter et al. 1994,1995).

In summary, a consensus appears to be emerging that the proper approach to MCMC monitoring lies somewhere between the two extremes recently advocated by Geyer (one long chain, perhaps plotted versus iteration) and Gelman and Rubin (a single multichain diagnostic).
