Reference-contexts: In this paper we present some experiences in changing the forms of teaching in a way that we assume will encourage higher quality in learning. Active participation in a course, instead of passive listening, has been proved to increase learning in Computer Science courses (see <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]), and, in general, to promote a greater interest and thus better possibilities to remember and use the skills in future life [3] In order to gain experience and thus increase the repertoire of our teachers, we conducted a study that included four mechanisms to increase active participation, interaction

These mechanisms are: 1. Daily help in laboratories. 2.

Reference-contexts: Apart from the judgement on the quality of the project, these reasons include: 1. The students actively reasoned about their own and others' programs and expressed opinions during the seminars. This required them to function at the analysis and synthesis levels in Bloom's taxonomy <ref> [4] </ref>. 2. Many students told the teachers that they believed they learned more by the methods used in this course. 3. The students were exposed to many more programs than just their own and those of their teachers. 4.

Reference-contexts: Finally we give our conclusions. 2. MOTIVATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS In our study, we wanted to achieve the following goals: 1. The process of learning should move from learning facts towards understanding and capability to apply knowledge. 2. The students should learn the skills of program ming <ref> [5] </ref>. 3. The students should learn to communicate their results. 4. The students should be more motivated for thier studies and thereby learn better A major constraint in the study was economics, since there was no room for increased costs for the education.

Reference-contexts: The students should be more motivated for thier studies and thereby learn better A major constraint in the study was economics, since there was no room for increased costs for the education. Another constraint was the students' time, since the work load is occasionally very high <ref> [6] </ref>. Our aim was to increase the efficiency of the time students devoted to their studies, without increasing the amount of time they spent.

Reference-contexts: THE STUDY The mechanisms were tried in an ordinary first-year Computer Architecture course at X University during spring 1994. We used Tanenbaum <ref> [7] </ref> for general theory and Ford-Topp [8] for assembly language programming on Mc680x0. We had 65 students (6 women) enrolled this year, out of which 52 (5 women) passed.

Reference-contexts: The assembly language programming assignments, which consisted of three closed labs and one final project, were carried out in a lab equipped with Mc680x0 development systems. There was also one micro-programming assignment, carried out on SUN-systems, simulating a processor using the machine description language ISPS <ref> [9] </ref>. The students worked either individually or in groups of two.
