Reference-contexts: In spite of this history, the peculiar properties of coordination have exerted surprisingly little influence on the development of theories of syntactic competence, in contrast with, say, passivization and question formation <ref> (to name two other phenomena discussed in Chomsky 1957) </ref>. This curious state of affairs might be explained if there were no non-trivial properties of coordination: any theory could, with equal ease, explain the phenomenon. However, it is well-known that this is not the case.

Reference-contexts: Who did John read a book about e on Monday? b. * Who did John read Sue's book about e on Monday? c. * Who did John destroy a book about e on Monday? Such a parallelism between coordination and extraction, if it is real <ref> (cf. Dowty 1988, pp.181-182, for possible doubts) </ref>, is inexplicable under C's account, so far as I can tell. C suggests a second argument that SR is a parsing operation on the basis of parallelism in cases of non-constituent coordination.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of cases, however, in which the locus of explanation remains the subject of some debate. Witness, for example, the varying accounts of unacceptability of sentences having crossing dependencies <ref> (cf. Fodor 1978 vs. Pesetsky 1982) </ref>, or differing explanations of the ill-formedness of sentences involving extraction from islands (cf. Ross 1967, inter alia, vs. Marcus 1980). The pervasive phenomenon of coordination has been the focus of linguistic research from the very beginnings of generative grammar (Chomksy 1957, Gleitman 1965).

Reference-contexts: In some cases there has been virtual unanimity as to the locus of the explanation. The degraded acceptability of sentences involving center-embedding has almost always been accounted for in terms of some type of processing limitation <ref> (Miller and Chomsky 1963, inter alia) </ref>. On the other hand, the complex distribution of clitic pronouns in Romance languages is widely agreed to be the result of grammatical properties, be they syntactic or phonological (Kayne 1975, inter alia).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a number of transformational treatments have maintained a classical view, generating the complex cases with constituent coordination in tandem with deletion or across the board movement <ref> (Sag 1976, Larson 1988) </ref>. Though such neoclassical proposals solve the "logical problem of coordination" of characterizing what elements may be coordinated, they do not provide a solution to the problem of parsing coordination, particularly if we demand an efficient algorithm.
