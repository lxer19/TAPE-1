Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is heavily supported by military institutions, while practically no effort goes into the investigation of possible contributions of AI to the avoidance and termination of crises and wars. This paper makes a first step into this direction by investigating the use of machine learning techniques for discovering knowledge in international conflict and conflict management databases. We have applied similarity-based case retrieval to the KOSIMO database of international conflicts. Furthermore, we present results of analyzing the CONFMAN database of successful and unsuccessful conflict management attempts with an inductive decision tree learning algorithm. The latter approach seems to be particularly promising, as conflict management events apparently are more repetitive and thus better suited for machine-aided analysis.

Reference-contexts: The resulting dataset consisted of 718 conflict management events, 408 (56.82%) 3 Note, however, that C4.5 was not applicable for the ERGEBNISP task, where the prediction of lists is required. 4 Parts of this section have previously appeared as <ref> (Trappl, Furnkranz, and Petrak 1996) </ref>. 14 of them resulting in failure and 310 (43.18%) being successful. Each event in this dataset was encoded with 52 attributes and one class variable that indicated whether the attempt has been successful or not. First we generated and analyzed an unpruned tree with C4.5. <p> However, these results are very preliminary. We have not yet tried to measure the predictive accuracies of the learned rule sets or of single rules. Our impression is that the rules are overly complex, so that more sophisticated methods for noise-handling should be tried <ref> (Furnkranz 1996) </ref>. 8 Conclusion In this paper we have presented first steps into the discovery of knowledge in databases of international conflicts and conflict management attempts.

The exact details of these and other settings of the feature weights can be found in <ref> (Petrak, Trappl, and Furnkranz 1994) </ref>. 4.2 Similarity-Based Case Retrieval Situations of international conflict and war, like other complex human life situations, are often described and explained in terms of previous similar situations. <p> thus yield 4 different degrees of similarity from 0.0 (when 1 is predicted and 4 is correct and vice versa) to 1.0 (exact prediction) depending on the difference between the prediction and the actual intensity. 13 with various different similarity functions does not have a significant influence on the outcome <ref> (Petrak, Trappl, and Furnkranz 1994) </ref>. In general, however, the presented results are not very convincing. <p> outcome <ref> (Petrak, Trappl, and Furnkranz 1994) </ref>. In general, however, the presented results are not very convincing. Even the propositional decision-tree learner C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), which is severely handicapped for these tasks because it cannot make use of the abstraction hierarchies and the list-valued features, performs about the same as 1-NN (Petrak, Trappl, and Furnkranz 1994). 3 A possible explanation for the disappointing results might be that the data are not well suited for classification tasks. <p> A complete listing of these rules can be found in <ref> (Furnkranz, Petrak, Trappl, and Bercovitch 1994) </ref>. However, in general, an unpruned tree will contain too many leaves that cover only a very small number of examples. <p> It is easy to see that, if the conditions of rule 6 are met, the chances of being successful do not change significantly, while the distribution of successes and failures changes significantly in rules 4, 5 and 8. A more detailed analysis can be found in <ref> (Furnkranz, Petrak, Trappl, and Bercovitch 1994) </ref>. 6 Related Work and Discussion There has been some previous work on rule induction via decision tree learning, which we will briefly discuss below. More extensive overviews can be found in (Mallery 1988), (Schrodt 1991a), and (Schrodt 1996).

Reference-contexts: By admitting only a small number of highly relevant features irrelevant tests near the leaves of a tree can be effectively avoided. Thus automatic feature subset selection can also be viewed as a form of pruning. We have used the wrapper approach of <ref> (John, Kohavi, and Pfleger 1994) </ref> to determine the set of attributes from which the best decision tree can be learned.

Reference-contexts: Mallery and Sherman (1993) show a variety of learned rules, specifying their degree of purity and their coverage.

An initial experiment in discovering partial determinations | dependencies between attributes | in the new CONFMAN database is briefly discussed in <ref> (Kramer and Pfahringer 1996) </ref>. However, so far the discovered dependencies were mostly trivial, resulting from redundancies in the encoding of the data (for example between variables that are available in both a numeric and a discretized form). A more careful analysis of these results has still to be performed.

Reference-contexts: Most recently we have also started to experiment with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithms (Muggleton and De Raedt 1994; Quinlan and Cameron-Jones 1995; Bergadano and Gunetti 1995). We have applied the most commonly used algorithm Foil <ref> (Quinlan 1990) </ref> to a recent version of the CONF-MAN database. The motivation for these experiments is two-fold: Firstly the CONFMAN database actually consists of two relational tables, one containing information about the conflicts and one containing information about their various conflict management attempts.

The learning examples were taken from the CONFMAN database, but all entries where the outcome of the conflict management attempt is unknown were removed from the database. <p> Therefore, it seems natural to consider pruning heuristics for obtaining simpler trees and rules. 5.2 Induction of Complete Trees Table 6 gives an overview of some results we have achieved with different settings of two parameters of the standard decision-tree learning algorithm C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref>. For each setting we report the number of nodes (including leaves) in the generated tree (Size), the percentage of the training examples that will be correctly classified by the tree (Purity), and the predictive accuracy estimated by a 10-fold cross-validation and its standard deviation.

Reference-contexts: Artificial Intelligence has some potential for supporting political scientists in this area of research. Several approaches are possible: * Understand the phenomenon 'conflict' itself and try to develop a general theory of conflict in order to apply previously successful conflict resolution strategies to new or existing crises <ref> (Simpson Jr. 1985) </ref> * Learn patterns in international events that lead to crises and use this infor mation for early warning systems that can be used to timely alert peacekeeping organizations (Merritt, Muncaster, and Zinnes 1993) * Detect regularities and rules that are common to various conflicts and use this information
