Reference-contexts: In this paper we concentrate on the routing problems and the inter-operability with the conventional Inter-Domain Multicast Routing (IDMR) protocols [11, 17, 13, 10, 18]. The multicast address resolution and maintenance problems are delegated to another service called congress: CONnection oriented Group-address RESolution Service <ref> [1] </ref>. congress achieves scaleability through a design that is based on the following principles: * No flooding: congress does not flood the WAN on every group membership change. * Hierarchical design: congress services are provided to applications by multiple hierarchically organized servers. <p> These groups are termed D-groups. D-groups will be further discussed in Section 4. The resolution and management of these multicast router groups is performed through the congress <ref> [1] </ref> services described later in Section 3. An ip-senate extension at a multicast router uses the group membership information that it receives from congress, in order to open ATM connections that bypass ("cut-through") the IP routing mechanism. <p> Each server in the congress hierarchy maintains only a part of the spanning tree that consists of its immediate neighbours. The spanning 4 The interested reader is advised to read the full version of the CONGRESS protocol presented in <ref> [1] </ref> 5 In the context of this paper, an end-point is always an ip-senate router. 6 The congress hierarchy can be readily mapped onto a peer group hierarchy provided by the native ATM network layer, PNNI [9].

Reference-contexts: In our opinion, the current proposal of EARTH architecture is not scaleable to a large ATM cloud environment and does not provide an ultimate answer for the generic problems described in VENUS <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 There is a work in progress to distribute the MARS server in order to provide for load balancing and fault tolerance [2]. <p> Unfortunately, to provide an NHRP equivalent for multicast is not a trivial task, as will become clear from the next subsection. (a) Datagrams Duplications (b) Routing Loop 1.2 The challenges As is explained in VENUS 3 <ref> [3] </ref>, the current IETF solution for IP multicast (MARS) is not trivially scaleable to a large ATM cloud environment. The most prominent problems arising in a straight-forward IP multicast cut-through routing solutions are listed below. * If hosts are allowed to communicate directly with other hosts (as in [3]), bypassing the <p> VENUS 3 <ref> [3] </ref>, the current IETF solution for IP multicast (MARS) is not trivially scaleable to a large ATM cloud environment. The most prominent problems arising in a straight-forward IP multicast cut-through routing solutions are listed below. * If hosts are allowed to communicate directly with other hosts (as in [3]), bypassing the multicast routers, then each host should maintain membership information about all other hosts scattered all over the internet and belonging to the same IP multicast group. This scheme forces the hosts to maintain large amounts of data that should be kept consistent and updated. <p> This means, that prior to any data transfer, a group name (address) should be resolved into a set of the ATM addresses of the group members. In contrast to the conceptual solution proposed in VENUS <ref> [3] </ref>, ip-senate is not concerned with group membership maintenance and resolution. ip-senate' scope is limited to making cut-through forwarding decisions and to forwarding of the multicast data among the multicast routers. Actually, ip-senate is an optional extension to the multicast routing protocols as explained in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: This scheme forces the hosts to maintain large amounts of data that should be kept consistent and updated. In addition, a considerable traffic overhead is introduced when membership changes, e.g., join or leave events are flooded over the network. * As was noted in RFC2121 <ref> [5] </ref>, an ATM Network Interface Card (NIC) is capable of supporting a limited number of connections (i.e., VCs originating from a NIC or terminating at a NIC).

Note, that there is no relationship between a congress domain and a LIS. 8 tree is constructed and maintained according to end-point join/leave requests.

Reference-contexts: In the MARS approach, each LIS is served by a single MARS server and is termed MARS cluster 2 . Roughly, the purpose of the deployment of a MARS server is similar to that of IGMP <ref> [12] </ref> to register the hosts that are directly attached to a multicast router and are interested to receive multicast traffic targeted to a specific IP class D address. The important difference, however, is that MARS is aware of the connection-oriented nature of the underlying network. <p> In order to make routing decisions and to open the cut-through connections, ip-senate communicates with the congress protocol that supplies group address resolution and maintenance services. In the classical IP multicast model <ref> [12] </ref>, a host does not have to become a registered member of a multicast group in order to send datagrams to this group. A sender does not see any difference between sending a datagram to a multicast IP address or a unicast IP address.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the extra routing hops impose an unnecessary segmentation and reassembly overhead, because every IP datagram should be reassembled at every router in order that it could take routing decisions. The development of NHRP <ref> [15] </ref>, a protocol for discovering and managing IP unicast forwarding paths over ATM that bypass IP routers, lead many people to seek for a multicast equivalent.

If a multicast cut-through mechanism is deployed in conjunction with some IDMR protocol, then conflicts with the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) <ref> [18] </ref> may arise. The RPF mechanisms prevent routing loops and are crucial for the correct operation of IDMR protocols. Thus, the cut-through traffic should be treated carefully in order not to confuse the IDMR protocol.

Reference-contexts: In the MARS model that retains the LIS model, it is assumed that all the multicast communication outside the LISs is performed via multicast routers that run some IDMR protocols. As explained in <ref> [22] </ref>, the classical LIS model may be too restrictive for networks based on switched virtual circuit technology, e.g., ATM. Obviously, if LISs share the same physical ATM network (ATM cloud), the LIS inter-networking model may introduce extra routing hops.
