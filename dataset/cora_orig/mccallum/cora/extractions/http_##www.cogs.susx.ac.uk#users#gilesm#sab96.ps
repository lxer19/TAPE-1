Abstract: Traits that are acquired by members of an evolving population during their lifetime, through adaptive processes such as learning, can become genetically specified in later generations. Thus there is a change in the level of learning in the population over evolutionary time. This paper explores the idea that as well as the benefits to be gained from learning, there may also be costs to be paid for the ability to learn. It is these costs that supply the selection pressure for the genetic assimilation of acquired traits. Two models are presented that attempt to illustrate this assertion. The first uses Kauffman's NK fitness landscapes to show the effect that both explicit and implicit costs have on the assimilation of learnt traits. A characteristic `hump' is observed in the graph of the level of plasticity in the population showing that learning is first selected for and then against as evolution progresses. The second model is a practical example in which neural network controllers are evolved for a small mobile robot. Results from this experiment also show the hump.

Reference-contexts: Fitness is awarded after the individual's `learning lifetime', or what I will call posthumously. An example of this involves the evolution of back-propagation neural networks as in <ref> (Chalmers, 1990) </ref>. In unsupervised systems the training and testing occur concurrently. The individual learns and adapts during its lifetime and is scored continually throughout this process.

Reference-contexts: This may have little significance, such as a bird eating a bad-tasting berry, but conversely may cause the individual irreparable damage, such as falling down a precipice (learning the hard way). Possible mechanisms for reducing these costs in nature are parental care and animal play behaviour <ref> (Fagen, 1981) </ref>. Lots of juvenile animals practice the more dangerous behaviours, such as hunting or fighting, that they will require later as adults, whilst they are under the protective care of their parents.

Reference-contexts: A neural network control structure is evolved for it using the Khepsim 4 simulator <ref> (Jakobi, Husbands, & Harvey, 1995) </ref> for the task of wall-following using only the I.R. sensors, which can detect objects to a distance of about 10cm. Since the behaviour of the robot in the simulator closely matches the behaviour in the real world, no distinction will be made between them.

Reference-contexts: Two very different evolutionary models will be presented that adhere to the evolutionary framework and that show genetic assimilation. The first uses NK fitness landscapes <ref> (Kauffman, 1993) </ref> to produce an abstract model for comparison with the second which involves the evolution of a controller for a real world robot. <p> That is, a landscape was desired that provided many local optima for search such that evolution could adopt a genetically fixed solution at a lower maximum than one found by learning if the costs of learning were too high. Kauffman's NK fitness model <ref> (Kauffman, 1993) </ref> was chosen since it provides an arbitrary fitness landscape of specified ruggedness. 5.1 The NK Fitness Model In this model, N refers to the length of a binary genotype and the value of K sets the level of epistasis by determining the dependence the partial fitness of a gene

Reference-contexts: For example, in humans, it is very difficult to imagine the English language being genetically specified at birth, even if the language were static and universal. It is better for evolution to provide an innate tendency to acquire a structured language and let learning sort out the details <ref> (Pinker, 1994) </ref>. 4.2 The Costs of Learning The previous section outlined some of the benefits that learning can give an evolving individual. It is probably less obvious that there are also evolutionary costs to be paid by an individual for that ability to learn.
