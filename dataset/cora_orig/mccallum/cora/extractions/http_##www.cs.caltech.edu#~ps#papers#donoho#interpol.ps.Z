Abstract: We describe several "wavelet transforms" which characterize smoothness spaces and for which the coefficients are obtained by sampling rather than integration. We use them to re-interpret the empirical wavelet transform, i.e. the common practice of applying pyramid filters to samples of a function. Acknowledgements.

Reference-contexts: To be more precise we recall the pyramid filtering algorithm for obtaining theoretical wavelet coefficients of functions in L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, as described in [CDJV]. <p> One starts from a wavelet transform based on orthogonal wavelets ' and of compact support where the moments of through order D are zero, and the wavelets have R continuous derivatives. [ET1] W n maps continuous functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into countable coefficient sequences ~ = ( ~ fi j 0 ; ); ( ~ff j 0 ; ); ( ~ff j 0 +1; ); : : : ; ( ~ff j 1 1; ) : : : : [ET2] There are smooth functions ( ~' j 0 ;k <p> ~ff j 1 1; ) : : : : [ET2] There are smooth functions ( ~' j 0 ;k ), ( ~ j;k ), 0 k &lt; 2 j , j j 0 which are R-times differentiable functions of support width C2 j so that every function f 2 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> has an expansion f = k X X ~ff j;k ~ j;k : with uniform convergence of partial sums (the convergence is unconditional if f has some regularity). 4 [ET3] The first n coefficients result from pre-conditioned pyramid filtering U j 1 ;j 0 ffi P D of the <p> The constants of equivalence do not depend on n = 2 j 1 but may depend on j 0 and on the wavelet being used. [ET5] The coefficients = W n f measure smoothness. Each Besov space B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with 1=p &lt; &lt; min ( R; D) and 0 &lt; p; q 1 is charac terized by the coefficients in the sense that k ~ k b p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + ( jj 0 X j ~ff j;k <p> the coefficients in the sense that k ~ k b p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + ( jj 0 X j ~ff j;k j p ) 1=p ) q ) 1=q ; is an equivalent norm to the norm of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; here s + 1=2 1=p, with constants of equivalency that do not depend on n, but which may depend on p; q, j 0 and the wavelet filters. Each Triebel-Lizorkin space F p;q [0; 1] with 1=p &lt; &lt; min ( R; D), 1 &lt; p; q 1 is <p> ) q ) 1=q ; is an equivalent norm to the norm of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; here s + 1=2 1=p, with constants of equivalency that do not depend on n, but which may depend on p; q, j 0 and the wavelet filters. Each Triebel-Lizorkin space F p;q [0; 1] with 1=p &lt; &lt; min ( R; D), 1 &lt; p; q 1 is characterized by the coefficients, in the sense that, with j;k the indicator function of the interval [k=2 j ; (k + 1)=2 j ), k ~ k f p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 <p> that, with j;k the indicator function of the interval [k=2 j ; (k + 1)=2 j ), k ~ k f p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + k ( jj 0 k is an equivalent norm to the norm of F p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; here s + 1=2. In words, the empirical wavelet coefficients, which derive solely from finite filtering calculations, are actually the first n theoretical coefficients for a nicely behaved transform of continuous functions. This interpretation gives us several insights immediately. <p> In the Appendix will prove the inequality !(2 j ; P j f ) C !(2 j ; f ) (2.7) with C independent of f and j. From (P j f )(k=2 j ) = f (k=2 j ), we get that for x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> jf ((k + x)=2 j ) (P j f )((k + x)=2 j )j jf ((k + x)=2 j ) f (k=2 j )j !(2 j ; f ) + !(2 j ; P j f ) Hence kf P j f k 1 C !(2 j ; f <p> This implies results for L p Sobolev classes W m p with 1 &lt; p 1. Theorem 2.8 Consider an interpolating wavelet transform based on [IW1]-[IW6]. Let min (R; D) &gt; &gt; 1=p, p 2 (1; 1], q 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. <p> There are equivalent norms for the function spaces B p;q p;q with 1=p &lt; &lt; min (R; D) such that sampling followed by interpolation is norm-reducing on all those spaces. 3 Interpolating Transform on the Interval We now develop interpolating wavelet transforms for C <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. These are based on adapting the inhomogeneous interpolating transforms for D + C 0 (R) to "life on the interval". We concentrate exclusively on Interpolating Wavelets of Compact Support. So in this section ' and derive from the Deslauriers-Dubuc fundamental wavelet F D . <p> Theorem 3.1 Let j 0 be a non-negative integer satisfying 2 j 0 &gt; 2D + 2 (non-interacting boundaries). There exists a collection of functions ' [ ] [ ] j;k such that every f 2 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> has a representation f = k=0 [ ] X 2 j 1 X ff j;k j;k ; with uniform convergence of partial sums j j 1 as j 1 ! 1. <p> of degree D to the rightmost D + 1 samples: [ and using this to extrapolate to k 2 j : ~ fi j;k = 2 j=2 [ One then has data at every lattice site and can form the interpolate ~ f = k=1 15 Definition 3.2 V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is the collection of (restrictions to [0,1] of ) functions ~ f defined by (3.1), where ~ fi = E j;D ffi (fi j;k ) 2 j 1 k=0 . This gives us a 2 j -dimensional vector space of functions with two key properties. <p> First, the coefficients arise by sampling: fi j;k = ~ f (k2 j )=2 j=2 ; 0 k &lt; 2 j : This property is simply inherited from the interpolating transform on R. Second: D V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> Indeed, if is a polynomial of degree D, then # j = . <p> Hence the extrapolated samples satisfy ~ fi j;k = 2 j=2 (k2 j ); k 2 Z; and so we may use the reproducing formula for the transform on R, = 2 j=2 k=1 1 X ~ fi j;k ' j;k which exhibits as an element of V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We now seek a representation of the finite-dimensional space V j [0; 1] involving finite sums. Each extrapolated coefficient ~ fi j;k with k &lt; 0 is a linear functional of the extrapolating polynomial and hence of the left-end samples (fi j;k : 0 k D). <p> j ); k 2 Z; and so we may use the reproducing formula for the transform on R, = 2 j=2 k=1 1 X ~ fi j;k ' j;k which exhibits as an element of V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We now seek a representation of the finite-dimensional space V j [0; 1] involving finite sums. Each extrapolated coefficient ~ fi j;k with k &lt; 0 is a linear functional of the extrapolating polynomial and hence of the left-end samples (fi j;k : 0 k D). <p> We therefore have, by rearranging the sum (3.1) 16 Lemma 3.3 Every f 2 V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> has the representation ~ f = k=0 # 2 j D2 X fi j;k ' j;k 2 j 1 X fi j;k ' [ where again, the coefficients fi j;k = 2 j=2 f (k=2 j ): Two crucial but trivial comments. <p> To finish up our analysis of V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> we record ' j;k = &gt; &lt; ' j;k 0 k D ' [ Our discussion so far proves all the properties of ' [ ] j;k claimed in the theorem.

Hence (3.5) implies (3.2). 2 Now define Q [0;1] [0;1] [0;1] j and set W j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> = Range (Q [0;1] j ). Because of the lemma we have just proved, this is a 2 j -dimensional function space. We now seek an accessible representation of elements of W j [0; 1]. <p> (3.5) implies (3.2). 2 Now define Q [0;1] [0;1] [0;1] j and set W j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> = Range (Q [0;1] j ).

Define ~ff j;k by, if 0 k &lt; 2 j , 1 )=2 j ) (P j f )((k + 2 and 0 for other values of k. <p> X ~ff j;k j;k + A # (t) + A [ (t) = k=0 # + k=bD=2c 2 j 1 X ~ff j;k [ If we now define j;k = &gt; &lt; j;k 0 k &lt; bD=2c [ ; the above discussion proves Lemma 3.5 Every f 2 V j+1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> can be written f = k=0 [ ] 2 j 1 X ff j;k j;k ; where fi j;k = 2 j=2 f (k=2 j ); k 2 K j [0;1] 19 As in the case of the transform on the line, we can iterate this decomposition, writing every <p> = k=0 [ ] 2 j 1 X ff j;k j;k ; where fi j;k = 2 j=2 f (k=2 j ); k 2 K j [0;1] 19 As in the case of the transform on the line, we can iterate this decomposition, writing every element of V j 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as a sum of a term in V j 0 [0; 1], j 0 &lt; j 1 , and intervening terms from W j [0; 1], j 0 j &lt; j 1 : f = k [ ] X X ff j;k j;k More generally, if f is not <p> where fi j;k = 2 j=2 f (k=2 j ); k 2 K j [0;1] 19 As in the case of the transform on the line, we can iterate this decomposition, writing every element of V j 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as a sum of a term in V j 0 [0; 1], j 0 &lt; j 1 , and intervening terms from W j [0; 1], j 0 j &lt; j 1 : f = k [ ] X X ff j;k j;k More generally, if f is not in V j 1 , we have that f almost obeys this <p> [0;1] 19 As in the case of the transform on the line, we can iterate this decomposition, writing every element of V j 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as a sum of a term in V j 0 [0; 1], j 0 &lt; j 1 , and intervening terms from W j [0; 1], j 0 j &lt; j 1 : f = k [ ] X X ff j;k j;k More generally, if f is not in V j 1 , we have that f almost obeys this decomposition, with an error f P j 1 f . <p> Now if jjf P [0;1] j f jj 1 ! 0 as j ! 1, we can rigorously justify an infinite sum decomposition. But jjf P [0;1] j f jj 1 ! 0 if f is uniformly continuous. Hence this decomposition holds for every f 2 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 3.2 Smoothness Classes on the Interval The interpolating wavelet transform on the interval gives a characterization of Besov classes on the interval. Theorem 3.6 Let denote the wavelet coefficients for the interpolating wavelet transform on the interval. <p> Then kk b p;q k (fi j 0 ; )k ` p + ( jj 0 2 j 1 X jff j;k j p ) 1=p ) q ) 1=q ; where s = + 1=2 1=p, gives an equivalent norm for the Besov spaces B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where 1=p &lt; &lt; min (R; D), p; q 2 (0; 1]. The proof for the case of the line has been constructed so that it will continue to work here, with only slight modifications. See the appendix. Triebel-Lizorkin equivalence is also proved in the appendix. <p> Then kk f p;q k (fi j 0 ; )k ` p + k ( jj 0 2 j 1 X jff j;k j q j;k ) 1=q k p where s = + 1=2, gives an equivalent norm for the Triebel spaces F p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where 1=p &lt; &lt; min (R; D) and p; q 2 (1; 1]. 3.3 Fast Compression of Interpolating Expansions This interpolating wavelet transform for the interval has a very simple algorithmic structure. <p> The calculation of ff j;k requires only D + 2. Moreover the multiplications involve rational coefficients with small denominators. 20 The interpolating transform for the interval gives a sparse representation of certain functions particularly so for piecewise polynomials: If f is a piecewise polynomial on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with P pieces, each of degree D, sampled on a dyadic grid of n = 2 j 1 points, then from those samples, we can calculate the wavelet coefficients at scale j 1 1 and each coarser scale, and there are only C 0 + P (D + 1) <p> Suppose that f 2 B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for some &gt; 1=p. Then (*) has finitely many nonzero terms. The series obtained by summing the wavelet series corresponding to (*) produces a reconstruction f (*) ; f (*) ! f in B p;q [0; 1] as * ! 0. <p> Suppose that f 2 B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for some &gt; 1=p. Then (*) has finitely many nonzero terms. The series obtained by summing the wavelet series corresponding to (*) produces a reconstruction f (*) ; f (*) ! f in B p;q [0; 1] as * ! 0. The sparse representation f (*) has advantages over another finite series, namely P [0;1] The slogan is that f (*) contains the terms which are important, while P [0;1] j f contains all terms which might possibly be important. <p> In contrast f (*) uses only order J P storage, and this is within a logarithmic factor of optimal. For more general classes of functions, we have the following result. Theorem 3.8 Suppose f 2 B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with D &gt; &gt; 1=p. <p> In the appendix we prove the following lower bound on the minimax error: Lemma 3.9 Let F be the Besov ball of all functions f with B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> norm bounded by B, &gt; 1=p f2F f n 2S n Hence no essentially better rate of approximation than n is possible, by any method of sparsifying the representation of f to n terms, no matter how nonlinear or computation-ally intensive the scheme might be. <p> How does f (* n ) compare with P J f as an approximation scheme? For functions in B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> we have kf P J f k 1 jJ jJ jJ 2 J (1=p) kk b p;q C Moreover there is a lower bound indicating that this upper bound is sharp, to within constant factors. <p> This is a generalization of what we saw already for approximations to piecewise polynomials. For an example of a function where the two methods differ, we need an f 2 B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> but f 62 B 1;1 [0; 1]. An example is the cusp function exp (jx 1=2j) which is piecewise C 1 but which does not belong to C 1+ffi . <p> This is a generalization of what we saw already for approximations to piecewise polynomials. For an example of a function where the two methods differ, we need an f 2 B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> but f 62 B 1;1 [0; 1]. An example is the cusp function exp (jx 1=2j) which is piecewise C 1 but which does not belong to C 1+ffi . <p> Except for a constant number of terms at each resolution level which "feel" the cusp, and which decay like 2 j (3=2) , the wavelet coefficients decay like 2 j (1=2+D) . The function f is in B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> whenever 1=p &lt; 1, and so, the rate of approximation by f (* n ) is at least n D+ , &gt; 0. In contrast, f is in B 1;1 [0; 1] only if 1, and the rate of approximation by P J f is only n 1 . <p> The function f is in B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> whenever 1=p &lt; 1, and so, the rate of approximation by f (* n ) is at least n D+ , &gt; 0. In contrast, f is in B 1;1 [0; 1] only if 1, and the rate of approximation by P J f is only n 1 . <p> We omit the proof. 28 Theorem 5.1 Let f 2 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> k2K j 1 ; : : :): The norm k ~ k b p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ; )k ` p + ( jj 0 2 j 1 X j ~ff j;k j p ) 1=p ) q ) 1=q is an equivalent norm for B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with constants of equivalency independent of j 1 &gt; j 0 . Theorem 5.3 Let 1 p &lt; &lt; min ( R; D) and p; q; 2 (1; 1]. <p> Together theorems 5.2 and 5.3 furnish [ET1]-[ET5] of the introduction and complete the proof of all main results. 6 Discussion 6.1 The Critical Case: = 1=p Interpolating wavelet transforms are not suited for dealing with Besov and Triebel spaces if = 1=p. First, members of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and F p;q [0; 1] in the critical case are guaranteed to be bounded only if q 1. For example, log (x) 2 B 1=p p;1 [0; 1] for all p &gt; 0. <p> First, members of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and F p;q [0; 1] in the critical case are guaranteed to be bounded only if q 1. For example, log (x) 2 B 1=p p;1 [0; 1] for all p &gt; 0. Hence, sampling of functions in the critical spaces with q &gt; 1 doesn't really make sense. <p> First, members of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and F p;q [0; 1] in the critical case are guaranteed to be bounded only if q 1. For example, log (x) 2 B 1=p p;1 [0; 1] for all p &gt; 0. Hence, sampling of functions in the critical spaces with q &gt; 1 doesn't really make sense. In particular, no general inequality of the form kk b p;q C kf k B p;q (6.1) with C independent of f . <p> The homogeneous space _ B 1=p p;q is invariant under dilation, so the right side of (6.1) is bounded under the rescaling f (a (t t 0 )), a &gt; 1. Now let f be a smooth function supported in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with f (0) = 1. Set f [j 1 ] = f (2 j 1 t). Then kf [j 1 ] k B p;q [0;1] is bounded as j 1 ! 1. <p> It is built from translates and dilates of a finite collection of functions, at the "heart" of which are functions from the transform on the real line. However, this is just one way to construct interpolants. There is a dyadic construction of an interpolating spline Schauder basis of C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by Domsta (1976) for which function space characterizations have been proven; but Domsta's basis does not have dilation and translation homogeneity. <p> Then as long as &gt; d=p, we get that the interpolating coefficients give equivalent norms to Besov and Triebel spaces.

It is known that Besov space B p;q (R) is normed as follows (Meyer, 1990, Vol. I, Chapter 2, pages 50-51). <p> The assumption 1=p &lt; &lt; min (D; R) makes ffi &gt; 0 so that H decays exponentially fast away from the diagonal and furnishes a bounded linear transformation from ` q to ` q for every q 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. <p> Suppose that each space F j;k consisting of restrictions to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of functions j;k f where f = P k c j;k w j;k , is finite dimensional. <p> Lemma 7.8 Let (w j;k ) k be a collection of continuous functions, not necessarily translates and dilates of a single function. Suppose that each space F j;k consisting of restrictions to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of functions j;k f where f = P k c j;k w j;k , is finite dimensional. <p> One adapts the proof to life on the interval by substituting L p <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for L p , P [0;1] j for P j and V j [0; 1] for V j , and pursues the same proof line-by line. In the end, the proof rests on the establishment of the four conclusions (7.12), (7.14), (7.15), (7.16) offered by Lemmas 7.5-7.8. <p> One adapts the proof to life on the interval by substituting L p <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for L p , P [0;1] j for P j and V j [0; 1] for V j , and pursues the same proof line-by line. In the end, the proof rests on the establishment of the four conclusions (7.12), (7.14), (7.15), (7.16) offered by Lemmas 7.5-7.8. <p> Hence the needed uniformities for Lemmas 7.5-7.6 hold, and the key conclusions (7.12)-(7.14) follow. Moreover, the spaces V j;k given by the restriction of renormalized functions ( j;k f )j [0;1] ; f 2 V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are all finite-dimensional, because of the uniform support bounds. Similarly, the spaces W j;k given by ( j;k f )j [0;1] ; f 2 W j [0; 1] are finite dimensional. <p> Moreover, the spaces V j;k given by the restriction of renormalized functions ( j;k f )j [0;1] ; f 2 V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are all finite-dimensional, because of the uniform support bounds. Similarly, the spaces W j;k given by ( j;k f )j [0;1] ; f 2 W j [0; 1] are finite dimensional. <p> log 2 (kk b p;q =*): Hence, kf f (*) k 1 j=j 0 X (ff j;k ff j;k ) j;k k 1 + jJ X ff j;k j;k k 1 Let M 1 be the maximum number of wavelets at any level j "touching" any single point x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let M 2 be the maximum L 1 norm of any standardized wavelet ( or ', boundary-corrected or not). <p> Hence the minimax error over a hypercube fv : kvk ` 1 (n+m) g is sup inf kv v n k 1 = : The idea is to embed a 2 j+1 -dimensional hypercube into B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, 2 j+1 &gt; n and use the above observation to bound the L 1 error on its approximation by an n-term sum. <p> k k ` p r ff j 0 ;k 0 = 0; j 0 6= j; fi j 0 ;k = 08kg: Now evidently k (ff j;k ) k k ` p 2 j (+1=21=p) kk b p;q : This tells us that the class of objects with B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> norm B contains an ` p -ball fi j;p (r j )of radius r j = C B 2 j (+1=21=p) .

Reference-contexts: We have used it in this article only to emphasize the formal similarity with the orthogonal wavelet transform. It makes perfectly good sense to use instead L 1 -normalization (2 j x k). Periodization. The periodized wavelet for <ref> [0; 2] </ref> ' ffi X ' j;k (!=2 + 2 j k 0 ) is well-defined (assuming rapid decay of ') and is interpolating. The corresponding transform characterizes Besov and Triebel spaces on the circle in the range &gt; 1=p. Higher Dimensions.
