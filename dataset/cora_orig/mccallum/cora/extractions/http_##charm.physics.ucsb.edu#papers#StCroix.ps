Reference-contexts: The high-statistics spectrum from CLEO [2], shown in figure 8, is fitted to the two main components using a model for the shape of the primary-lepton spectrum and measured spectra for both steps in the secondary process. There are two models used: (a) an inclusive parton model, the AC-CMM <ref> [3] </ref> model; and (b) an exclusive model, a modified version of the ISGW [4] model, usually called ISGW**. In the ACCMM model there are two parameters, the c-quark mass and the effective Fermi momentum of the spectator quark inside the meson.

Reference-contexts: This error is effectively due to the uncertainty in the bottom and charm quark masses, which is larger than the differences between models for given quark masses. Shifman, Uraltsev, and Vainshtein <ref> [10] </ref> argue the result is primarily sensitive to m b m c , and that the corresponding error on jV cb j should be only 0:002. 14 2.1.2 jV cb j from Exclusive Semileptonic Decays Two modes dominate B ! X c `- decays: B ! D`- and B ! D <p> In particular, there are a number of calculations of F (1): 0:96 0:03 [15], 0:93 0:03 [14], and 0:89 0:03 <ref> [10] </ref>. Experimentally, measuring the differential decay rate at w = 1 is difficult because at that point the D fl is moving slowly, leading to a very slow decay pion for experiments operating at the (4S).

Reference-contexts: Thus the zero recoil point corresponds to w = 1. The HQET limit at zero recoil determines the normalization at this point: ~ = 1:0. There are no corrections to this limit of order (1=m Q ) at w=1 <ref> [13] </ref>; the leading corrections are of order (1=m 2 Q ), and are somewhat model dependent.

Reference-contexts: With all of this experimental information on semileptonic D decays, we can inquire whether the pseudoscalar and vector mesons dominate the inclusive semileptonic rates. Table 19 summarizes the experimental information. The inclusive decay rate is measured by Mark III to be (17:0 1:4) fi 10 10 s 1 <ref> [71] </ref>. Thus the modes not included here contribute only (8 11)% of the inclusive rate. This agrees with tight limits from explicit searches for higher modes such as D ! K fl `- [72].

Reference-contexts: Thus the modes not included here contribute only (8 11)% of the inclusive rate. This agrees with tight limits from explicit searches for higher modes such as D ! K fl `- <ref> [72] </ref>. The interpretation of this result is that the final state s quark from charm semileptonic decay is usually produced with a small enough momentum that it is bound in an l = 0 qq meson.

Reference-contexts: If the fake muons are small, the pure leptonic decay events should be visible beyond the endpoint in the p t spectrum. WA-75 has observed 6 events with p t &gt; 0:90 GeV/c, with an estimated background, including from D + leptonic decays, of 0.8 <ref> [76] </ref>. Turning this into a branching ratio is somewhat difficult, since they observe no other D + s modes cleanly.

CLEO-II has used a very different approach to observe D + s ! + -, in which they observe the process D fl+ s ! flD + s ! + - <ref> [77] </ref>. The missing momentum and energy in the hemisphere of the muon are used to estimate p and E -. For events in a broad mass range around the D s mass, the mass difference M = M (-fl) M (-) is plotted.

Reference-contexts: The two 1 + mesons may be eigenstates of neither S or j. HQET gives us some guidance on this point. In the M Q &gt;> fl QCD limit, the scheme of two doublets is preferred. According to HQET <ref> [82] </ref>, the wave functions of the light constituents does not depend on the flavor or spin of the heavy quark. In particular, HQET predicts a doublet with j = 3=2 which decays in d-wave, and a doublet with j = 1=2 which decays in s-wave.

Reference-contexts: Because of the extra factor of p 4 for the d-wave decay rate and the low momentum in the decay the j = 3=2 states are expected to be much narrower than the j = 1=2 states <ref> [83] </ref>. 58 The data on charm spectroscopy come from fixed target experiments and from e + e experiments in the upsilon region. The easiest decay to observe is D 0 1 ! D fl+ , because of the clean D fl+ signal.

Reference-contexts: The absence of a signal in the D + mode identifies this as a probable J P = 1 + state. Figure 34 shows the D 2 ! D signals from E-687 <ref> [84] </ref>. These states are more difficult to see because they require clean D + and D 0 peaks to start with. CLEO observes the decay D fl0 2 ! D fl+ , with a branching ratio about 1/2 that for the D + decay.

Reference-contexts: Because the energy released in the decay is small, the resolution is quite good and the backgrounds relatively small. The most recent addition to the list of observed charm mesons is the D s2 , seen by CLEO <ref> [85] </ref> in the decay mode D 0 K + . The masses and widths of the L=1 D s mesons are shown in table 22. 59 s1 ! D fl0 K + and D s1 ! D fl+ K 0 from CLEO.

Reference-contexts: The penguin amplitude will probably be smaller than the spectator amplitude by a factor of around 5. Second, it is possible to use the other B ! decays to extract the CKM phase from the measured asymmetry <ref> [86] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, since this resolution is determined by multiple scattering and not intrinsic resolution of the detector, it should be a reliable estimate. CLEO-II is a prototype for a B-factory detector <ref> [87] </ref>. Its excellent momentum resolution for charged tracks and detection efficiency and energy resolution for low momentum fls are needed to do well at the (4S). In addition, there are a number of major improvements and additions necessary for a B-factory detector.
