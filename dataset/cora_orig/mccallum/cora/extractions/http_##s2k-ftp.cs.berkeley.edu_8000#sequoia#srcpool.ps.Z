Abstract: Project Sequoia 2000 [STON91] is a large-scale research collaboration between computer scientists and global change researchers including several University of California campuses and industrial sponsors. Computer equipment for the project consists primarily of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) file servers, workstations, and dedicated network routers which run the DEC ULTRIX V4.2a operating system. Nearing the end of its second year, the project has begun to spawn new computer science technologies in the areas of networks, storage systems, filesystems, databases, and visualization. As these technologies continue to emerge, it is clear that a coherent management scheme for the integration and distribution of Sequoia 2000 software will be a key to the success of the project. It is also clear that, as new commercial operating systems and computer architectures evolve, portability must be a primary consideration. The following document focuses on a subset of this larger problem; the management of operating system software, both in the kernel and in operating system-related user applications, created for Sequoia 2000. We introduce the Sequoia Source Pool which will be the vehicle for management and distribution of new operating system software for Sequoia 2000 academic researchers and industrial partners. This is a working document which gives a roadmap for those wishing to add new code, build Sequoia operating system kernels and user applications, or simply wander around out of curiosity. It is not expected that this document will specify a rigid framework for all current and future Sequoia 2000 software management, but rather will continue to evolve along with the project.

Building User Applications For the short term, we ask that you build user applications by going directly to the appropriate directories in /usr/src/sequoia/ultrix-4.2a on toe. (See the previous section on the structure of the pool).

Reference-contexts: STRUCTURE OF THE SOURCE POOL The Sequoia Source Pool resides on a DECSystem 5900 located at U.C. Berkeley which is part of the Project Sequoia Bigfoot fileserver. [STON91] This machine can be accessed over the Internet as toe.CS.Berkeley.EDU or over the Sequoia 2000 Network (S2Knet) <ref> [PASQ92] </ref> as toe.s2k.Berkeley.EDU. Since the S2Knet employs private high-speed leased lines expressedly for Sequoia 2000 activity, we recommend that researchers whose workstations are directly connected to the S2Knet use the S2Knet name if possible. To access the source pool, you must be a member of the s2k-src group on toe.
