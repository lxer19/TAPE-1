Abstract: We discuss the formulation of a simulator in three spatial dimensions for two phase groundwater flow and transport with biodegradation kinetics that has been developed at Rice University for massively parallel, distributed memory, message passing machines. The numerical procedures employed are a fully implicit mixed finite element method for flow and a characteristics-mixed method for transport and reactions of dissolved chemical species in groundwater. Domain decomposition solvers have been employed for solving the systems of equations resulting from the dis-cretization of the model. Results from applying this simulator to a bioremediation field problem using a recirculation well in an air-water system are discussed.

Reference-contexts: This code achieves almost linear parallel scaling [4,2]; thus, it is highly effective when run on a parallel machine. Details regarding the formulation and analysis of this procedure can be found in [3] and application to contaminant transport in single phase groundwater flow in <ref> [1] </ref> and [4]. PIERS, a fully implicit two phase flow code with fully coupled wells, was originally developed at Exxon Production Research by J. Wheeler and Smith for the INTEL iPSC/2 [16]. Capillary pressure and relative permeability are functions of water saturation and formation type.

Reference-contexts: We are presently adding general boundary conditions to the code as well as modifying the code to treat three phases (air, non-aqueous phase liquid, and water). Future plans include the incorporation of meshes defined by fairly general geometry <ref> [5] </ref> and the development of robust, fully implicit multilevel solvers for modeling three phase flow. In addition we plan to add more chemistry and microbiology as well as the capability of simulating fractured media.

Reference-contexts: Rice University and Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) began a collaborative research effort in 1992 that involves laboratory, field, and simulation work directed toward validating remediation strategies. We discuss below some preliminary computational results based on some recent microbial CCl 4 destructive kinetics developed by Skeen and Chan of PNL <ref> [14] </ref>. The model has six components: electron acceptors nitrate NO 3 , nitrite NO 2 , and acetate CH 3 COO , CCl 4 , microbial mass C 5 H 9 O 3 N, and a nonreactive tracer. We also assume that the retardation factor for acetate is 1.8.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Microbial biodegradation is an innovative, emerging technology for handling subsurface water contamination [4,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,15,17]. It is a natural process that can be accelerated by the injection of certain nutrients such as dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and acetate. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency studies <ref> [15] </ref> have shown that this strategy can result in complete removal of contaminants, whereas other proposed restoration strategies have not proven as effective. Biodegradation technologies are being employed at several U.S. Department of Energy Laboratories in an effort to remove or contain volatile organic compounds.

Reference-contexts: The development of our multiphase, three spatial dimension code, RPGW/MP, has involved combining and modifying two codes: RPGW, Rice Parallel Groundwater Code for transport and reactions [1,4,2], and PIERS, Parallel Implicit Experimental Reservoir Simulator for flow <ref> [16] </ref>. RPGW/MP is under development and future generalizations are discussed at the end of the paper. The outline of the paper is as follows. In x2 we describe the governing flow and transport equations with biodegradation in an unsaturated/saturated porous medium. For simplicity, we assume linear sorption and aerobic conditions. <p> PIERS, a fully implicit two phase flow code with fully coupled wells, was originally developed at Exxon Production Research by J. Wheeler and Smith for the INTEL iPSC/2 <ref> [16] </ref>. Capillary pressure and relative permeability are functions of water saturation and formation type. Functional forms can be defined by tables or by definition as piecewise C 2 splines. Nonlinearities are treated implicitly by Newtonian iteration. Rice University, in cooperation with J.
