Reference-contexts: Further, the extraction of data and control-flow graphs forms the basis of many of the successful results in automatic synthesis ([3], <ref> [1] </ref>, ([5]). All of these works sharply restrict the syntax of behavioral constructs and limit the set of allowable programs to those written in styles known to be synthesizable. It seems certain that we would have to do the same.

Reference-contexts: For each syntactic construct there are associated with it one or more axioms, each of which specifies a legal reduction of that construct to another one. Although this thesis does not directly use the results of either work, we acknowledge previous work by Boehm <ref> [2] </ref> and a paper by Sabry and Field [14] as foundational and inspirational sources. <p> The introduction of function poses a special challenge, since the assumption that expressions are free of side-effects would no longer hold. Boehm <ref> [2] </ref> proposes a way to axiomatize side-effects and aliasing under this more general condition. Second, while the semantics given in this thesis are accurate models of Verilog behavior, there are probably alternative formulations that are just as correct, but produce better code from the point of view of their synthesizability.

Reference-contexts: Stewart is investigating the semantic properties of many structural constructs, particularly port connections and continuous assignment ([16], [15]). Another prominent effort in formal reasoning about behavioral Verilog is the work surrounding the VIS system and its FSM compiler, vl2mv ([5], <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]). VIS has successfully synthesized and verified substantial Verilog programs, and is even capable of performing some optimizations on the resulting logic. The formal semantics developed for the language are only implicitly given by the transformation algorithms, however.

Reference-contexts: Many of the subtleties of the language represented in our semantics are described in Gordon's "Semantic Challenge" paper <ref> [9] </ref>, and it is from this work that this author first learned about Verilog. Gordon's recent work has been directed toward the development of different theoretical models for understanding Verilog and other HDL semantics ([8], [10]), using subsets of the language with simplified semantics. <p> The first normalization is a flattening transformation, borrowed from Gordon <ref> [9] </ref>, by which we collect into a single top-level module the set of threads to execute concurrently. <p> Now add the nonblocking updates block (NBU) which, of course, is empty for now (we haven't started the program yet): 3 Steven Sharp, personal communication.

Reference-contexts: Van Tassel [17] gives an operational semantic description of its simulation cycle, formulated in the higher-order logic notation of the Cambridge HOL system.

Reference-contexts: Verilog began as (and remains today) an industrial language whose design was geared toward providing a practical tool for engineers rather than a tool for academic research. Until the release of the IEEE Standard <ref> [12] </ref> in 1996, there was no official standard semantics for the language. At the time of this writing, no complete formal semantics exists at all. <p> Hence, we will avoid a full description in this thesis, referring the reader instead to Section 4 of the IEEE Standard <ref> [12] </ref>. There are some general properties of expression evaluation that we will include here, however. We can specify how an expression is evaluated (i.e., the order of evaluation) by defining an evaluation context for expressions, E.

Each axiom describes formally the behavior of a construct S 1 in terms of a (usually) simpler construct, S 2 , by stating that any occurrence in a program of S 1 can be rewritten as S 2 1 .
