Abstract: The empirical study described in this paper addresses the issue of communication among members of a software development organization. In particular, we have studied interactions between participants in a review process. The question of interest is whether or not organizational relationships between the review participants have an effect on the amount of communication effort expended. The study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. These methods include participant observation, structured interviews, graphical data presentation, and non-parametric statistics. The results of this study indicate that several organizational factors do affect communication effort, but not always in a simple, straightforward way. Not surprisingly, people take less time to communicate when they are familiar with each other, and when they work in close physical proximity to each other. However, certain mixtures of organizationally close and distant participants to an interaction result in more effort needed to communicate. Also, interactions tend to be more effort-intensive when they occur in a meeting, and when more people are involved. These results provide a better understanding of how organizational structure helps or hinders communication in software development.

Reference-contexts: More obviously, interactions involving more people generally took longer. The relationship between communication and organizational structure (in organizations in general) is a strong theme running through the organization theory literature, from classic organization theory [4, 9], to organizational growth [12], to the study of technological organizations <ref> [1] </ref>, to business process reengineering [3, 5]. Most of this work takes a global, long-range perspective. The common proposition is that organizational structure evolves over time to facilitate communication and that, in fact, facilitating communication is the main purpose of organizational structure. <p> Most of this work takes a global, long-range perspective.

Reference-contexts: However, the state of the art is such that not all of these factors have been identified, much less understood well enough to be controlled, predicted, or manipulated. One factor that has been identified <ref> [2] </ref> but is still not well understood is information flow. It is clear that information flow impacts productivity (because developers spend time communicating) as well as quality (because developers need information from each other in order to carry out their tasks well). <p> However, organization and communication have not been explored in detail in software development organizations. Several studies have provided evidence of the relevance of both organizational structure (along with other "non-technical" factors) and communication in software development. In particular, at least one study <ref> [2, 6] </ref> has shown the drawbacks of organizational and physical distance and discovered the importance of "shared internal representations", which has led to our particular definition of familiarity. 4 2. Study Setting This study took place at IBM Software Solutions Laboratory in Toronto, Canada. <p> That is, interactions tend to require more effort when the participants are not previously familiar with each others work. This is consistent with Krasner's [6] findings about "common internal representations".

However, it must be noted that most interactions have low familiarity and high physical distance, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. <p> In this case, the two groups were those interactions falling into the high XOD /low MOD category, and those which did not. The test yielded a significant value, even at the p&lt;.01 significance level. This contrasts with Curtis <ref> [2] </ref>, who hypothesized that the relationship between organizational distance and communication ease is more straightforward.

Study Setting This study took place at IBM Software Solutions Laboratory in Toronto, Canada. <p> Familiarity reflects the degree to which the participants in an interaction work together or have worked together outside the review, and thus presumably share common internal representations of the work being done. This factor was found to be relevant in Krasner et als study <ref> [6] </ref> of large software development projects. The familiarity measure also attempts to capture the important informal networks which do not make up part of the management structure (measured by organizational distance). <p> It appears from Figure 4 that high effort is associated with low familiarity and with high physical distance (the latter observation being the strongest). That is, interactions tend to require more effort when the participants are not previously familiar with each others work. This is consistent with Krasner's <ref> [6] </ref> findings about "common internal representations". As for physical distance, interactions tend to require more effort when the participants work in physically distant locations. Curtis [2] and Allen [1] have had similar findings.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that only process-oriented interactions are considered in this study, as opposed to unplanned interactions 7 that do not correspond directly to some step of a defined process. Although such informal communication has been shown to be more valuable <ref> [7] </ref>, there is still a need for focused studies of process communication because it can be planned for and controlled, if we know the factors that can be manipulated to make it more efficient. The data collection procedures used in this study are participant observation [13] and structured interviews [8].

It would be better, and should be possible, to have at least two sources for each piece of information collected.

Reference-contexts: The limitations discussed below have been remedied in the design of the larger study, resulting in a more useful and relevant study which was more recently conducted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center under the auspices of the Software Engineering Laboratory <ref> [11] </ref>. The main differences between the larger study and the pilot study described in this paper are its setting, size, and scope. Other differences arise as a result of remedying the limitations of this study, as described below.

Reference-contexts: Some automatic support for managing this part of the description (or even handling the data itself through an electronic form of the description), as well as a better notation, was needed. In particular, we have used Yus 21 Actor-Dependency models <ref> [14] </ref> as a notation and mechanism in subsequent studies for organizing information and data, and for automating some of the data analysis. Another lesson learned from this study was that the interactions, as defined, did not naturally fit the way the participants thought about the review process.
