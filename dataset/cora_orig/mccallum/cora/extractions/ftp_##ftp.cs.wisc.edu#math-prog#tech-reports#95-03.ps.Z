Abstract: This note considers a recent paper by Friesz, Bernstein, Mehta, Tobin & Ganjalizadeh (1994) which addressed issues related to the management of transportation networks. We take issue with the conclusions of this paper. First, we believe that the Tatonnement model is a poor framework for measuring the benefits of better information. Second, we demonstrate that the Tatonnement approach is a poor method for computing Wardropian equilibria. We present three formulations for computing exact equilibria which are significantly more efficient and can be implemented with standard modeling software. fl Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, email: ferris@cs.wisc.edu .

Reference-contexts: Within the realm of deterministic models, a concise statement of the economic perspective is that "perfect foresight provides a useful benchmark because deviations from full rationality are not likely to be systematic" <ref> (Auerbach & Kotlikoff 1987) </ref>. In any Tatonnement model, decisions are consistently fooled and the underlying adjustment process is prone to "overshoot and collapse", as can be seen in Figures 2 and 3 of Friesz et al. (1994).

Reference-contexts: There are two subsets of N that represent the set of origin nodes O and destination nodes D respectively.
