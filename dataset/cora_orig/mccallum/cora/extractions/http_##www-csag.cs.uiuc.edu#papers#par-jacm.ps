Abstract: Network throughput can be increased by allowing multipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels [26]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive networks are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. In the presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and is provably livelock free. In addition, planar adaptive networks can simultaneously support both in-order and adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery. Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two dimensions (with k &gt; 2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed or allowing additional performance-enhancing network features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is amenable to efficient implementation. Simulation studies show that planar-adaptive routers can increase the robustness of network throughput for non-uniform communication patterns. Planar-adaptive routers outperform deterministic routers with equal hardware resources. Further, adding virtual lanes to planar-adaptive routers increases this advantage. Comparisons with fully adaptive routers show that planar-adaptive routers, limited adaptive routers, can give superior performance. These results indicate the best way to allocate router resources to combine adaptivity and virtual lanes. Planar-adaptive routers are a special case of limited adaptivity routers. We define a class of adaptive routers with f degrees of routing freedom. This class, termed f-flat adaptive routers, allows a direct cost-performance tradeoff between implementation cost (speed and silicon area) and routing freedom (channel utilization). For a network of a particular dimension, the cost of adaptivity grows linearly with the routing freedom. However, the rate of growth is a much larger constant for high dimensional networks. All of the properties proven for planar-adaptive routers, such as deadlock and livelock freedom, also apply to f-flat adaptive routers.

Reference-contexts: Large-scale machines increase the effect of node latency, favoring networks with greater connectivity. Looser constraints on wiring bisection and pin-bounds also make higher-dimensional networks more attractive. Furthermore, recent results indicate that higher-dimensional networks may exhibit more robust performance over a range of communication locality <ref> [1] </ref>. Cost Metrics In routing networks, the most expensive part is the wires for the physical channels. Following that, the second most expensive elements are the buffers and switching hardware (crossbar or other). Only if routing algorithms become very complex is routing logic a significant contributor.

Reference-contexts: Direct comparison is difficult as descriptions of their approach leave open many design choices which may affect both performance and implementation complexity critically. For example, routing can be minimal or non-minimal. Minimal adaptive routing algorithms developed by Duato [16] and Sanz <ref> [3] </ref> require only a few virtual channels (2) per physical channel, but require that routing decisions be made based on accurate buffer status information. These routing algorithms are dynamically deadlock-free as the routing decisions assure that no cycles can form.

Reference-contexts: Non-minimal or misrouting-based adaptive routing. Packets may temporarily move away from their destination (misrouting), but eventually arrive at their destination. Due to misrouting, the distance a packet travels may not be minimal. The network may do some unnecessary work. Significant work has explored non-minimal approaches <ref> [28, 24, 4] </ref>. While such efforts have produced interesting routers which can outperform minimal adaptive routers in some cases, the use of misrouting makes prevention of livelock a difficult problem.

Reference-contexts: This is because the rapid fluctuations and traffic and intrinsic delay in obtaining remote information make it difficult to obtain accurate information. The distinction we make between deterministic and adaptive routing is sometimes termed oblivious versus non-oblivious routing <ref> [5] </ref>. Overview In the paper, we begin by briefly discussing some of the most relevant work in adaptive routers for k-ary n-cubes in Section 3. In particular, we highlight the cost of deadlock-avoidance in these systems.

Reference-contexts: Not only does the lesser packet requirement reduce network loading, it also may improve a critical performance feature, memory operation latency, by eliminating waits for acknowledgements in the protocol.

Reference-contexts: In multiprocessor networks, routing decisions must be made within a few cycles, and thus cannot incorporate complex distributed deadlock prevention and detection algorithms. Consequently, we focus on deadlock prevention schemes based on restricting the routing algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>. Because the physical network has cycles, naive routing schemes can produce deadlock, so we virtualize the network by introducing virtual channels (really only extra buffers) and define routing functions on the virtual networks. <p> We focus particularly on two families of networks, k-ary n-cubes and multi-dimensional meshes (k-ary n-cubes without wraparounds) and assume wormhole routing [15]. Dally and Seitz use virtual channels and restrict routing to implement deadlock-free routing in k-ary n-cubes <ref> [9] </ref>. However, their scheme assumes a deterministic routing algorithm, dimension-order routing. A minimal adaptive routing scheme described by Linder and Harden [26] extends the techniques of Dally and Seitz to allow adaptive routing while preventing deadlock.

Reference-contexts: Restricting the adaptivity in this fashion reduces the coupling between network dimensions, reducing the possibilities for inter-dimensional resource cycles. Consequently fewer resources are needed to avoid deadlock. 4.1 Notation and Terminology We adopt notation similar to that in <ref> [10, 26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All traffic must be specified as ordered or unordered. Planar-adaptive routing guarantees in-order packet delivery for the ordered traffic both in the fault-free case, and in the presence of static faults. 6 For simplicity, we assume only one "virtual lane" <ref> [11] </ref> per virtual channel, so packets routed along a single path cannot pass each other. In a multi-lane virtual channel system, passing can be prevented by limiting the ordered traffic for each source-destination pair to a single lane. <p> Fewer virtual channels may allow the construction of faster routers (fewer buffer loads to drive), or the additional hardware available may be used to incorporate other performance enhancing features such as more "virtual lanes" <ref> [11] </ref>. Planar-adaptive routing is relatively low cost. Compared to Linder and Harden's scheme, planar-adaptive routing requires significantly fewer virtual channels. Planar adaptive routing requires only three buffers per physical channel, allowing the construction of very small, fast routers. <p> In higher-dimensional networks, the catch-up effect is even more pronounced. In three- and four-dimensional networks, PARs (2,2,2) are even better than dimension-order routers, giving identical peak throughput and lower latency. Previous published results <ref> [11, 22] </ref> show that virtual lanes can increase network throughput, but the incremental benefit of each virtual lane decreases with each additional lane. For the given quantity of resources, PARs partition them statically between deadlock prevention and virtual lanes.

Reference-contexts: However, the hardware cost of their approach is significant, requiring a large number of virtual channels per physical channel. Such hardware complexity typically reduces attainable network speed. Dally and Aoki have described an adaptive routing algorithm based on the notion of "dimension-reversals" <ref> [12] </ref>. Each dimension-reversal is a departure from dimension-order routing. In their static scheme, one additional virtual channel is required for each allowed dimension-reversal in order to prevent deadlock. Consequently, that scheme supports only a fixed number of dimension reversals. <p> A primary concern in adaptive networks is the cost of deadlock prevention. To assure deadlock-free routing, the planar-adaptive scheme requires only three virtual channels for k-ary n-cubes without wraparound channels. This is a dramatic improvement over previously published schemes <ref> [26, 12] </ref>. As shown in hardware overhead. Equally important, deadlock and livelock 5 are avoided without any complex reversal counting [12] or aging schemes [27]. This means that planar-adaptive routers will be very simple and can make routing decisions very rapidly. <p> To assure deadlock-free routing, the planar-adaptive scheme requires only three virtual channels for k-ary n-cubes without wraparound channels.

Although there are numerous paths between any source and destination, in order to avoid deadlock, deterministic routing defines a single path from source to destination. Fixed, single path routing prevents effective use of the network's density of physical interconnection because the physical channels are allocated inflexibly. <p> This significantly reduces the amount of hardware required and should reduce the time to setup and drive data across the switches. Low connectivity requirements also make it possible to use organizations which allow the router performance to be further optimized for high-speed, low latency performance <ref> [14, 13] </ref>. In planar-adaptive routers, the routing function prevents deadlock, completely independent of the flow control. No routing decisions depend on the presence or absence of flits in particular network buffers. This allows routing and flow-control decisions to be made separately, decoupling the hardware control structures and potentially increasing performance.

For each prop erty, we briefly describe how to extend the proofs. * Deadlock Freedom Routing within each f-flat is deadlock-free based on <ref> [26] </ref>. Cycles can not form between f-flats as packets always proceed through the f-flats in increasing order. 8 The f-flats could also be composed with decreasing degrees of overlap ranging from f 1 dimensions, as we have described, all the way to 0.

Requiring the faulty regions to be convex allows a larger fraction of the nodes to remain in service for a given pattern of faults. 5 Planar-adaptive routing without fault tolerance is trivially livelock free as only minimal routes are employed.

Reference-contexts: Updating reversal counts and making routing decisions on that basis may increase router complexity significantly. Recently, Glass and Ni have described a deadlock-free adaptive router based on prohibiting turns which cause cycles <ref> [29] </ref>. Direct comparison is difficult as descriptions of their approach leave open many design choices which may affect both performance and implementation complexity critically. For example, routing can be minimal or non-minimal.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, though we present the ideas in the context of wormhole routing [15] the ideas apply to virtual cut through [21] and store-and-forward networks as well. 2 The Problem Most existing multicomputer routing networks use deterministic routing <ref> [32, 30, 13, 31] </ref>. Although there are numerous paths between any source and destination, in order to avoid deadlock, deterministic routing defines a single path from source to destination. Fixed, single path routing prevents effective use of the network's density of physical interconnection because the physical channels are allocated inflexibly.
