Abstract: Cellular communications systems are formed by a collection of transmitters (base stations), each of which ensures the communication with the mobiles in the associated area (designated by cell). To avoid interference, base stations which are geographically close have to use different radio frequencies. In order to maximize the use of the available spectrum of frequencies and increase the system capacity, base stations which are far enough apart can reuse the same (i.e., cochannel) frequency. The reuse of frequencies is possible only if the corresponding level of interference at the cochannel cells does not exceed a given threshold value, which is determined by the quality of signal associated with the employed transmission technology [ 1 ] . Cellular design involves the choice of locations for the base stations, the determination of the shape and dimensions of the coverage area associated with each base station, and the choice of the frequency to use for communication inside the cell. This choice has to ensure a minimum quality level for the signal received at the system receivers throughout the cell. This requirement is expressed by specifying minimum values for the carrier-to-thermal-noise, C/N, and carrier-to-cochannel-interference, C/I, ratios, where C is the received power of the desired signal, N is the receiver thermal noise power, and I is the cochannel interference power, i.e., the received power of interfering signals originating from other cells using the same frequency. The value of C/N determines the cell dimension and the value of C/I sets constraints on the minimum distance at which the frequency is reused and on the number of cochannel interfering cells. The choice of the minimum values of C/N and C/I is not unique, giving the designer one additional degree of freedom which is, to a rough extent, equivalent to a scale factor in the cell sizes and distances between cells [2]. In the first and second generations systems in operation today (e.g., GSM, IS-54), the propagation characteristics of the frequency bands employed allow the use of cells much larger than the urban typical features (buildings, city blocks). Usually the associated base station equipment is installed in elevated places. For those systems, cellular design has been based on hexagonal cells (macrocells) and on simple isotropic propagation models [1]. A coverage area (ideally, the whole plane) is covered by a tessellation of identical cells, and analytical results that give useful insight into and guidelines for the system design can be obtained on the relationships between the required signal quality and the cell radius, reuse distance, number of frequency groups, and system capacity [1]. Some of the third generation systems under study today [3] will operate, due to the need for high bandwidth and the saturation of lower-frequency bands, in the millimeterwave frequencies. Millimeterwave communication systems present, relative to the systems above, the fundamental difference of propagation occurring mostly in line-of-sight, with negligible diffraction effects and with most building materials being almost totally opaque. These systems will make use of a large number of microcells. In an outdoor environment the base stations transmitters and receivers will be placed at low height, e.g., in lamp posts. In such situation, the shapes of cells and the interference between cells is determined by the specific geometry of streets, squares, intersections, etc., of the area to be covered. Given the lack of regularity of most such environments, the cellular design has to be made on a case-by-case basis, requiring detailed information about the urban obstacles, particularly buildings. However, since the computations involved are heavy, the design procedure has to be partly automated. In this talk, the structure and implementation of an interactive computational-geometry-based tool for microcellular design of millimetrewave communication systems in an outdoor urban environment is presented. The tool allows the creation and manipulation of maps representing the area to be covered, the
