Title: Group Signatures a la carte  
Author: Giuseppe Ateniese Gene Tsudik 
Abstract: A group signature scheme allows any member of a potentially large group to sign on behalf of the group. Group signatures are anonymous and unlinkable. Only a designated group manager can co-relate signatures and/or reveal the identity of the actual signer. At the same time, no one (including a group manager) can misattribute a valid signature. In this paper we construct a very efficient and provably secure group signature scheme.

Reference-contexts: Email:fateniese,gtsg@ISI.EDU Group digital signatures are a relatively new concept introduced in 1991 [4]. A number of improvements and enhancements followed. Some of the notable results are due to Camenisch <ref> [1] </ref>, Petersen [5] and Ca-menisch/Stadler [2]. This paper presented a very efficient and provably secure group signature scheme. Both its performance and its security appear to significantly surpass those of prior art. Both the size of the group public key and the length of a group signature are constant.

Substantially, these are signature schemes based on proofs of knowledge performed non-interactively making use of an ideal hash function (a la Fiat-Shamir). According to <ref> [2] </ref>, we will call these schemes signatures of knowledge. Let n = pq be a RSA-like modulus, a; b 2 ZZ fl n elements of large multiplicative order modulo both p and q and m a generic message.

Reference-contexts: prove the knowledge of x) and SKRNG (m; a x ; b y ; a; b; ]i 1 ; i 2 [) denotes an instance of a technique allowing a prover to convince a verifier that x y 2]i 1 ; i 2 [ (related to a protocol presented in <ref> [3] </ref>). 1 2 3 Our Group Signature Scheme We now turn to the actual construction of our group signature scheme. The initial phase involves the group manager (GRMGR ) setting the group public key Y. SETUP: 1. <p> As part of JOIN, the new member must also prove to GRMGR that the exponent x is such that 0 &lt; x &lt; v (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Moreover, GRMGR creates a new entry in the membership table, computes ID = A z and stores fID; A; JOIN transcriptg in the new entry. (JOIN transcript is formed by the messages received from the user in the steps above.

Reference-contexts: So-called "proof-of-knowledge" systems allow a prover to demonstrate knowledge of a secret such that no useful information is revealed in the process. In this paper, we take advantage of Schnorr signature <ref> [6] </ref> based schemes in order to show knowledge of secrets without knowing the order of the group in which one operates. Our primary motivation for this choice is its computational efficiency.
