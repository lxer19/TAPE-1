Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of computation of the output of the Weighted Myriad Filter. Weighted Myriad Filters form a large and important class of nonlinear filters that includes linear FIR filters, with several potential applications in robust signal processing and communications in impulsive non-Gaussian environments. Just as the weighted mean and the weighted median are optimized for the Gaussian and Laplacian distributions, respectively, the weighted myriad is derived based on the properties of ff-stable distributions, which have been shown to accurately model practically occurring impulsive processes. The weighted myriad is an M -estimator that is defined in an implicit manner; no closed-form expression exists for its computation, and its direct computation is a non-trivial and prohibitively expensive task. In this paper, the weighted myriad is formulated as one of the fixed points of a certain mapping. An iterative algorithm is proposed to compute these fixed points, and its convergence is proved rigourously. Fast algorithms for the weighted myriad are then developed, incorporating these fixed point iterations. Numerical simulations serve to demonstrate that these algorithms compute the weighted myriad with a very high degree of accuracy, at a relatively low computational cost. With the computational bottleneck removed by the contributions of this paper, the full potential of the class of Weighted Myriad Filters can be realized in robust signal processing and communications applications.

Reference-contexts: The class of weighted myriad filters is derived from the sample myriad, which is an M -estimator of location <ref> [13] </ref> for the class of ff-stable distributions. Given a set of samples fx i g N i=1 , an M - estimator of location is given by ^ 4 i=1 (x i ); where () is called the cost function of the M -estimator. <p> Note that when w i = 0 (S i = 1), the corresponding term in P () or Q () drops out; the sample x i is thus effectively ignored when its weight is zero. The weighted myriad is an M -estimator <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> function (v) = log (1 + v 2 ): (7) We can then express the weighted myriad ^ K (w; x) ^ from (5) as ^ = arg min Q () = arg min N X x i which defines an M -estimator of location from samples of varying scale <ref> [13] </ref>. The computation of the weighted myriad ^ is complicated by the fact that the objective function Q () can have several local minima, as we shall see presently. To derive some basic properties of ^ , we examine Q () further. <p> [x (1) ; x (N) ] in (b) is not restrictive since, even if the initial value 0 is chosen outside [x (1) ; x (N) ], (19) shows that m ; m &gt; 0 will all lie within this interval. (iii) This theorem exploits parts of Section 7.8 of <ref> [13] </ref>, which deals with the computation of regression M -estimates. Corollary 3.1.1 The sequence fQ m g converges: Q m # Q fl , where Q fl 4 = inf (fQ m g 1 10 Proof: It is evident from the theorem that Q m+1 Q m . <p> This completes the proof of Theorem 3.1. Remark Parts of our proof use ideas from Section 7.8 of <ref> [13] </ref> on the computation of joint regression M -estimates of location and scale. As promised earlier, we now verify that the functions C i () of (36) satisfy the condition (i) of (37): C i (v) (v) 8 v.

Reference-contexts: Using these algorithms, the full potential of the class of weighted myriad filters can now be realized in robust signal processing and communications applications. It is possible to define a generalized weighted myriad allowing for real-valued weights <ref> [14] </ref>; this is computed by transforming the input samples as well as the weights, and finding the weighted myriad of the transformed input samples using the transformed (now non-negative) weights. We therefore focus in this paper only on non-negative weights. The paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: We propose the following fixed point iteration algorithm to compute these fixed points: m+1 = T ( m ) = i=1 N X h i ( m ) In the classical literature, this is also called the method of successive approximation for the solution of the equation = T () <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> This does not guarantee that Q ( m+1 ) Q ( m ); however, it is shown in Section 3.2 that (21) does in fact decrease Q () at each iteration. We can contrast the recursion of (19) with the update in Newton's method <ref> [15] </ref> for the solution of the equation Q 0 () = 0: 0 4 Q 0 ( m ) ; (22) which is interpreted by considering the tangent of Q 0 () at = m : Z () 4 Here, Z () is used as a linear approximation of Q 0 <p> at which the tangent Z () crosses the axis: Q 0 ( 0 m+1 ) Z ( 0 Although Newton's method can have fast (quadratic) convergence, the major disadvantage of this method is that it may converge only if the initial value 0 is sufficiently close to the solution fl <ref> [15] </ref>. Thus, only local convergence is guaranteed.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the exact algorithm is typically dominated by the term -(2N 1) involving root finding; for example, the EISPACK routines <ref> [16] </ref> for root finding have complexity proportional to O (m 3 ) for a polynomial of degree m, making -(2N 1) ~ O (8N 3 ). 18 5 Numerical Examples The fixed point iterations of Section 3 and the fast weighted myriad computation algorithms I and II of Section 4 are

Reference-contexts: The exact computation of the weighted myriad requires finding the roots of the derivative, P 0 (), of the polynomial objective function P () (see Proposition 2.1). These roots are found using the polynomial root finding (PRF) method described in <ref> [17] </ref>, which is apparently superior in speed and accuracy to the best previously-known root finding methods. <p> For our example, as the figure shows, Q () has 4 local minima and 3 local maxima, and the input samples range from the smallest x (1) = 0:13 to the largest x (N) = 0:99. The 4 local minima, computed using the polynomial root finding (PRF) method of <ref> [17] </ref>, are at 0:17, 0:27, 0:38 and 0:93, with the exact weighted myriad being ^ PRF = 0:93. The fixed point iteration scheme of (19) was implemented with L = 10 iterations for this example, using different initial values in order to compute all the local minima of Q (). <p> The same weight vector was used to filter the input signal with several values of K, varying from K = 0:05 to K = 1:0 in steps of 0:05. Three algorithms were used for the filtering: the exact computation algorithm using polynomial root finding <ref> [17] </ref>, Algorithm I, and Algorithm II. The fixed point search algorithms I and II were implemented for iterations ranging from L = 0 to L = 5. All the computations were performed in C on a Sun Ultra2 Enterprise workstation (SUN4U/170 Ultra-2/1170).
