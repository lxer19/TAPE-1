Title: LEARNING GENETIC REPRESENTATIONS AS ALTERNATIVE TO HAND- CODED SHAPE GRAMMARS

Abstract: Shape grammars have been used to analyze and describe designs, and to create new designs that are similar in style to the designs the grammar is based on. The grammars are created by hand, involving a large amount of research about the designs and the design process. This paper proposes a different approach, where a system is given design examples, and in a bottom-up process learns stylistic features of the examples. This is achieved by using an evolutionary system that is able to change the representation it is using. With the creation of a more and more complex evolved representation, the search space of the evolutionary process is transformed so that the search for new designs is biased towards designs similar to the design examples.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, neither of the individuals is preferred. This selection alone is not sufficient to prevent all individuals clustering as a small subset of possible, good solutions. As an additional measure to prevent convergence, 'niching' is used <ref> (Horn and Nafpliotis, 1993) </ref>. Here, candidate individuals are compared with a number of other individuals in the population. For every individual, the distance between the fitness values is calculated. The number of individuals with a distance smaller than a threshold value is called the niche-count.

In all these examples, however, the translation from a set of designs into a shape grammar (and the reverse) has been done by hand.

Reference-contexts: Both functions can be mixed, as seen in the example used here. The line types can be represented by different colours, the coding then has some similarities to colour grammars <ref> (see e.g. Knight, 1994) </ref>. In colour grammars, however, the colours don't have any semantics attached, and colours can be mixed. 3. Learning evolved genes 3.1. GENETIC ENGINEERING One foundation for evolving representations is genetic engineering.

Reference-contexts: Since only the main floor is considered here, no bedroom zones occur in the designs. From the eleven Prairie Houses analyzed by Koning and Eizenberg (1981), four have been selected as examples for the evolving coding: the Henderson house, the Thomas house, the Martin house and the Baker house <ref> (Koning and Eizenberg, 1981) </ref>. Since the basic coding only allows horizontal or vertical lines, the diagonal lines at the wings of the Henderson house have been changed into a stepped shape. Figure 4 shows the floorplans used. <p> One possibility for including line types is to increase the number of different basic genes, 10 THORSTEN SCHNIER AND JOHN S. GERO level, and external form <ref> (Koning & Eizenberg 1981) </ref>. so that one basic gene is used for every additional type. If the number of types increases, or if additional basic elements like diagonal lines are introduced, the number of different basic genes used grows.

EVOLVING REPRESENTATION The starting point in the development of a system that creates and makes use of an evolving coding is a standard evolutionary system. The first step is to create a population of randomly created individuals.
