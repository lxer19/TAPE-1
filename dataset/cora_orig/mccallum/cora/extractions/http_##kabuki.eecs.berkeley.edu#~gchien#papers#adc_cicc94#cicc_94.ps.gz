Abstract: For portable DSP systems which require video-rate 8-10 bit ADCs, low power consumption of the ADC is one of the key requirements due to limited po wer supply from batteries. Also, as digital ICs operate at lower voltage, typically less than 5V, to reduce power consumption, the analog circuits also need to be designed for lo w voltage to be integrated on the same chip. This paper describes a 10-bit, 20-MS/s, 35-mW 1 pipeline ADC realized in 1.2- mm CMOS technology. The converter is implemented in fully dif ferential circuits and optimized to achieve low power consumption. It operates at 3.3 V to be compatible with lo w voltage digital IC circuits. It achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) of 58.7 dB, and its active area occupies 3.2 x 3.3 mm 2 .

Reference-contexts: One extra bit resolved in flash ADC allows the comparator offset to be within -Vref/ 2 B+1 as in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this ADC, the stage resolution (B) is chosen to be 1 for fast op amp settling time with increased feedback factor, and this also allo ws a simple digital error correction scheme, as in [1]. <p> flash ADC allows the comparator offset to be within -Vref/ 2 B+1 as in <ref> [1] </ref>.

However, unlike [1,2], a front end sample/hold amplifier is not used in this ADC. The input signal is directly sampled on the sampling capacitors of the first stage amplifier and the first stage flash ADC.

Reference-contexts: At low power supply voltages, MOS transmission gates do not function properly due to insufficient gate voltage to turn on the inversion layer in the channel. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, a char ge pump circuit <ref> [3] </ref> has been designed as shown in figure 3a. By applying a square w ave input signal of 3.3 V, C1 and C2 are self-char ged to ~3.3 V, and an inverted square wave output of ~5 V is generated. <p> Therefore, the size of the sampling capacitor is reduced until it is limited by this noise oor. However, small capacitors do not match well to high accurac y, and trim capacitor arrays are used to calibrate the D AC in a similar manner to <ref> [3] </ref>. C. Dynamic Comparators In pipeline ADCs, since one extra bit is resolved in each stage, a large comparator offset can be tolerated, and no precision comparators are needed, which often require a preamp with dc bias current.
