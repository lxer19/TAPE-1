Abstract: Efficient storage and retrieval of multi-attribute datasets has become one of the essential requirements for many data-intensive applications. The Cartesian product file has been known as an effective multi-attribute file structure for partial-match and best-match queries. Several heuristic methods have been developed to decluster Cartesian product files over multiple disks to obtain high performance for disk accesses. Though the scalability of the declustering methods becomes increasingly important for systems equipped with a large number of disks, no analytic studies have been done so far. In this paper we derive formulas describing the scalability of two popular declustering methods Disk Modulo and Fieldwise Xor for range queries, which are the most common type of queries. These formulas disclose the limited scalability of the declustering methods and are corroborated by extensive simulation experiments. From the practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure which can be used to predict the response time of a given range query and to guide the selection of a declustering method under various conditions.

Reference-contexts: There are a few well-known multidimensional declustering methods for Cartesian product files: Disk Modulo (DM) [14], Fieldwise Xor (FX) [30], Error Correcting Codes (ECC) [17], Hilbert Curve Allocation Method (HCAM) [16] and Vector-based declustering method [7]. Although ample analytic studies have been done for partial match queries <ref> [1, 14, 30, 45] </ref>, relatively little attention has been focused on range queries [31]. To the best of authors' knowledge, no analytic results have been provided so far for the scalability of multidimensional declustering methods with varying number of disks. <p> As an example, let D 1 = D 2 = fa; b; c; dg; D 11 = D 21 = fa; bg and D 12 = D 22 = fc; dg. Then the following is a Cartesian product file: Bucket <ref> [1; 1] </ref> = D 11 fiD 21 = f (a; a); (a; b); (b; a); (b; b)g Bucket [1; 2] = D 11 fiD 22 = f (a; c); (a; d); (b; c); (b; d)g Bucket [2; 1] = D 12 fiD 21 = f (c; a); (c; b); (d; a); <p> Then the following is a Cartesian product file: Bucket [1; 1] = D 11 fiD 21 = f (a; a); (a; b); (b; a); (b; b)g Bucket <ref> [1; 2] </ref> = D 11 fiD 22 = f (a; c); (a; d); (b; c); (b; d)g Bucket [2; 1] = D 12 fiD 21 = f (c; a); (c; b); (d; a); (d; b)g Bucket [2; 2] = D 12 fiD 22 = f (c; c); (c; d); (d; c); <p> Then the following is a Cartesian product file: Bucket [1; 1] = D 11 fiD 21 = f (a; a); (a; b); (b; a); (b; b)g Bucket [1; 2] = D 11 fiD 22 = f (a; c); (a; d); (b; c); (b; d)g Bucket <ref> [2; 1] </ref> = D 12 fiD 21 = f (c; a); (c; b); (d; a); (d; b)g Bucket [2; 2] = D 12 fiD 22 = f (c; c); (c; d); (d; c); (d; d)g A range query q is a d-tuple &lt; I 1 ; I 2 ; : : <p> Then it traverses the buckets in the order assigning each bucket to a disk unit in round-robin way. In [16], it has been empirically shown that HCAM outperforms DM, FX and ECC for small range queries and large number of disks. Abdel-Ghaffar et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have provided a coding-theoretic analysis of declustering Cartesian product files for partial-match queries. Both necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of strictly optimal disk allocation method. <p> Then, in the following lemmas, we present some fundamental properties related to such operations on binary representation of bucket coordinates, which are useful in deriving the formula of FX scalability.

In order to store a file on disk, the records are partitioned into buckets (or pages), containing mutually disjoint sets of records. <p> Among these methods, DM, FX and ECC have been originally invented for partial-match queries and the other two for range queries. 4 It has been shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that DM is strictly optimal for many cases of partial-match queries including all partial-match queries with only one unspecified attribute. <p> The declustering methods surveyed in this paper are summarized in Table 2.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A variety of complex data management requirements have arisen in many large-scale data-intensive applications which often need support for multidimensional objects and sophisticated access methods. Typical examples are scientific data <ref> [20, 44] </ref>, cartography and census data [34], the Earth Observing System (EOS) and remotely sensed image [42], and geographic information systems [41]. Frequent operations on these datasets include volume visualization, detecting transients, computing trends and averages and compositions, and accessing a spatio-temporal subset of images.

Reference-contexts: In addition to round-robin, range and hash partitioning [12], Gamma provides a hybrid-range partitioning scheme. The hybrid-range partitioning <ref> [22] </ref> is a combination of fragmentations of relations (sorted on a partitioning attribute) and round-robin partitioning. Bubba also provides both hash and range partitioning mechanism. One of the interesting features of Bubba is a partitioning mechanism based on the heat and temperature of relations. <p> However, the complexities of these methods are at least quadratic while all the previously mentioned methods (i.e., DM, FX, HCAM etc.) are linear.

Reference-contexts: Under this method, bandwidth fragmentation can be relieved with additional memory for buffer space and additional network capacity. Ghandeharizadeh et al. have proposed a declustering method called MAGIC to partition relations based on multiple attributes <ref> [23] </ref>. MAGIC partitions relations by constructing a grid directory on a relation where each entry in the grid represents a fragment of the relation. The goal of MAGIC is to maximize throughput for relatively small queries in multi-use environments. <p> The declustering methods surveyed in this paper are summarized in Table 2.

Faloutsos et al. have empirically shown that ECC outperforms DM and FX for partial-match queries, but ECC works only for Cartesian product files of all side lengths power of two [17].

Reference-contexts: Evidently it is not guaranteed that a strictly optimal declustering can be achieved for every Cartesian product file. 2.2 Survey of declustering methods Early prototypes of parallel database systems such as Gamma [10] and Bubba [4] are based on the shared-nothing architecture model <ref> [43] </ref> and employ partitioning strategies to distribute database relations across multiple processing nodes. In addition to round-robin, range and hash partitioning [12], Gamma provides a hybrid-range partitioning scheme. The hybrid-range partitioning [22] is a combination of fragmentations of relations (sorted on a partitioning attribute) and round-robin partitioning. <p> In the above example of the stock database, if a square query of side length 3 is given by &lt; [N; T ]; <ref> [21; 43] </ref> &gt;, then three buckets are retrieved from disk unit 0, and two buckets from each of disk units 1,2 and 3, which implies the response time of the query is three.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A variety of complex data management requirements have arisen in many large-scale data-intensive applications which often need support for multidimensional objects and sophisticated access methods. Typical examples are scientific data <ref> [20, 44] </ref>, cartography and census data [34], the Earth Observing System (EOS) and remotely sensed image [42], and geographic information systems [41]. Frequent operations on these datasets include volume visualization, detecting transients, computing trends and averages and compositions, and accessing a spatio-temporal subset of images.

Reference-contexts: There are a few well-known multidimensional declustering methods for Cartesian product files: Disk Modulo (DM) [14], Fieldwise Xor (FX) [30], Error Correcting Codes (ECC) [17], Hilbert Curve Allocation Method (HCAM) [16] and Vector-based declustering method [7]. Although ample analytic studies have been done for partial match queries <ref> [1, 14, 30, 45] </ref>, relatively little attention has been focused on range queries [31]. To the best of authors' knowledge, no analytic results have been provided so far for the scalability of multidimensional declustering methods with varying number of disks. <p> Abdel-Ghaffar et al. [1] have provided a coding-theoretic analysis of declustering Cartesian product files for partial-match queries. Both necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of strictly optimal disk allocation method. Sung <ref> [45] </ref> has conducted performance analysis of Disk Modulo and derived explicit expressions of response time for partial-match queries using Fourier transform. It can be easily shown that closed form of response time for range queries can also be derived using the same technique.
