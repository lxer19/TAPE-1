Reference-contexts: The method of session id allocation is up to the creating tool, but it has been suggested that a Network Time Protocol (NTP) timestamp be used to ensure uniqueness <ref> [1] </ref>. &lt;version&gt; is a version number for this announcement. It is needed for proxy announcements to detect which of several announcements for the same session is the most recent. <p> The first and second sub-fields give the start and stop times for the conference respectively. These values are the decimal representation of Network Time Protocol (NTP) time values in seconds <ref> [1] </ref>. To convert these values to UNIX time, subtract decimal 2208988800. If the stop-time is set to zero, then the session is not bounded, though it will not become active until after the start-time. If the start-time is also zero, the session is regarded as permanent.
Reference: [2] <author> H. Schulzrinne, S. Casner, R. Frederick, V. Jacobson, ``RTP: </author> <title> A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications'', </title> <type> RFC 1889 </type>
Reference-contexts: The meaning of the transport port depends on the network being used as specified in the relevant ``c'' field and on the transport protocol defined in the third sub-field. Other ports used by the media application (such as the RTCP port, see <ref> [2] </ref>) should be derived algorithmically from the base media port. Note: For transports based on UDP, the value should be in the range 1024 to 65535 Handley/Jacobson [Page 13] INTERNET-DRAFT 24th March 1997 inclusive. For RTP compliance it should be an even number.

Reference-contexts: A key field is permitted before the first media entry (in which case it applies to all media in the session), or for each media entry as required. 4 The format of keys and their usage is outside the scope of this document, but see <ref> [3] </ref>. The method indicates the mechanism to be used to obtain a usable key by external means, or from the encoded encryption key giv en. The following methods are defined: k=clear:&lt;encryption key&gt; The encryption key (as described in [3] for RTP media streams under the AV profile) is included untransformed in <p> and their usage is outside the scope of this document, but see <ref> [3] </ref>.

For RTP media streams operating under the RTP Audio/Video Profile <ref> [3] </ref>, the protocol field is ``RTP/AVP''. Should other RTP profiles be defined in the future, their profiles will be specified in the same way. For example, the protocol field ``RTP/XYZ'' would specify RTP operating under a profile whose short name is ``XYZ''. The fourth and subsequent sub-fields are media formats. <p> If a non-default (as defined in the RTP Audio/Video Profile) packetisation is required, the``ptime'' attribute is used as given below. For more details on RTP audio and video formats, see <ref> [3] </ref>. Predefined formats for UDP protocol non-RTP media are as below.

Reference: [4] <author> M. Handley, </author> <title> ``SAP - Session Announcement Protocol'', </title> <type> INTERNET-DRAFT, </type> <month> November 25th </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: SDP is designed to convey such information to recipients. SDP is purely a format for session description - it does not incorportate a transport protocol, and is intended to use different transport protocols as appropriate including the Session Announcement Protocol <ref> [4] </ref>, electronic mail using the MIME extensions, and the Hypertext Transport Protocol. SDP is intended to be general purpose so that it can be used for a wider range of network environments and applications than just multicast session directories. <p> SAP packets are UDP packets with the following format: Handley/Jacobson [Page 2] INTERNET-DRAFT 24th March 1997 0 31 | SAP header | |--------------------| | text payload | |/""/""/""/""/""/""/""/""/""/""| The header is the Session Announcement Protocol header. SAP is described in more detail in a companion draft <ref> [4] </ref> The text payload is an SDP session description, as described in this draft. The text payload should be no greater than 1 Kbyte in length. If announced by SAP, only one session announcement is permitted in a single packet. 4.2. <p> Private Sessions It is possible to create both public sessions and private sessions. Private sessions will typically be conveyed by encrypting the session description to distribute it. The details of how encryption is performed are dependent on the mechanism used to convey SDP - see <ref> [4] </ref> for how this is done for session announcements.

Reference-contexts: By default, the ISO 8859-1 character set is used.
