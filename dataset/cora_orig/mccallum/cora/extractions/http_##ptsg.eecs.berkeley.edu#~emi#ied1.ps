Abstract: We present a historical review and discussion of previous works on ion energy distributions (IED) arriving at the target in the collisionless sheath regime of a capacitively coupled rf discharge (RIE system). This regime is of great interest to experimentalists and modelers studying the new generation of high density discharges in which the sheath is much thinner than in the conventional RIE systems. The purpose of the review is to assess what has been done so far, to determine what factors influence the shape of the IEDs, and to clarify some issues about sheaths in high density systems. Having determined the important parameters, we perform some particle-in-cell simulations for a capacitively coupled rf plasma, which show that ion modulations in an rf sheath significantly affect the IEDs when t ion =t rf &lt; 1, where t ion is the ion transit-time and t rf is the rf period.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In processing plasmas, the ion energy and angular distributions (IED and IAD) arriving at the target are crucial in determining anisotropy and etch rates. Gottscho et al <ref> [1] </ref> (1992) presented an excellent review and description of microscopic uniformity in plasma etching. They show that whenever the etching rate depends on the ion energy flux, the ion angular distribution will influence the etching profile and will contribute towards the aspect ratio dependence of the etching rate.

Reference-contexts: Under these conditions, the number of ions able to impact the bottom surface relative to the number impacting the sidewalls will decrease as the aspect ratio increases. This scenario qualitatively accounts for RIE lag and such profile phenomena as sidewall bowing <ref> [2] </ref> (1989). Zarowin [3](1984) pointed out the importance of off-normal ion incidence in determining reactively ion etched profiles. He discussed how the IED can induce anisotropic etch reactions, and under certain circumstances can "enhance" the intrinsic chemical etch selectivity.

Reference-contexts: Most of the ion energy spread is caused by ion-neutral collisions. In this regime, the IED was shown to have multiple peaks and a large spread <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] </ref>. Davis and Vanderslice [9] (1963) were among the first to present experimental measurements of IEDs in dc glow discharges. Their measurements were made at relatively high pressures where the sheaths were highly collisional and most ions arrived at the target at low energies. <p> Closed form analytical expressions for IEDs in rf plasma reactors are rare and obtainable only after making very limiting approximations. IEDs have been calculated by approximate analytical models [15, 16, 17], the numerical integration of the equations of motion <ref> [18, 19, 4, 5, 7, 20] </ref>, Monte-Carlo simulations [21, 22, 6, 23, 24], a Monte-Carlo-fluid hybrid model [25], a particle-in-cell (PIC) method [26], and a particle-in-cell method combined with Monte-Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC)[27]. <p> The energies of the bombarding ions have been measured by electrostatic deflection analysers [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 13, 33], cylindrical mirror analysers [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] or retarding grid analysers <ref> [4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 41] </ref>. The energies were measured at the grounded electrode or at the powered electrode of the rf reactor. In some cases, quadrupole mass spectrometers were used to make mass resolved measurements. <p> Both types of collisions broaden the IED and shift it towards lower energies. Charge exchange collisions also lead to the formation of secondary peaks in the IEDs at lower energies. The origin of these peaks was described by Wild and Koidl <ref> [4] </ref> (1989). [See Figure 15]. Recall that the two primary peaks are due to the rf modulation of slow ions which entered the sheath at the sheath edge and did not experience collisions.

Reference-contexts: Closed form analytical expressions for IEDs in rf plasma reactors are rare and obtainable only after making very limiting approximations. IEDs have been calculated by approximate analytical models [15, 16, 17], the numerical integration of the equations of motion [18, 19, 4, 5, 7, 20], Monte-Carlo simulations <ref> [21, 22, 6, 23, 24] </ref>, a Monte-Carlo-fluid hybrid model [25], a particle-in-cell (PIC) method [26], and a particle-in-cell method combined with Monte-Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC)[27]. Many of the methods use presupposed fields and initial ion velocity distributions, while others try to obtain these self-consistently. <p> Because charge exchange collisions can produce fast neutrals that bombard the target, it may be necessary to consider neutral energy and angular distributions when calculating sputter and etch yields in collisional sheaths <ref> [7, 24] </ref>. 2.10 Low Energy Peak of IED for t ion =t rf t 1 In some of the numerical simulations of IEDs in collisionless sheaths at low frequencies (i.e., t ion =t rf t 1), we see cases where the low energy peak has vanished and the high energy peak

Reference-contexts: Many of the methods use presupposed fields and initial ion velocity distributions, while others try to obtain these self-consistently. The energies of the bombarding ions have been measured by electrostatic deflection analysers <ref> [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 13, 33] </ref>, cylindrical mirror analysers [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] or retarding grid analysers [4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 41]. The energies were measured at the grounded electrode or at the powered electrode of the rf reactor. <p> Thus, as t ion =t rf increases, the IED width shrinks and the two peaks of the IED approach each other until, at some point, they can no longer be resolved. 4 One of the earliest works to show ion sheath modulation are the laboratory measurements of Ero <ref> [28] </ref> (1958). He experimentally measured the IED in a Thoneman ion source and observed the effect of rf modulation on IED width E i . His ion energy spectra had the characteristic bimodal shape, already shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: More accurate expressions, valid for both low and high sheath voltages, are given by Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref> (1986). [See also Lieberman and Lichtenberg, 1994, Sec. 6.2][43]. Metze et al's numerical model will be described in the next section. There are two limiting cases depending on whether the impedance of the blocking capacitor C b is small or large compared to the discharge impedance Z P . <p> V P (t) and I P G (t) are plotted in approximation (9) for the sheath capacitance. The singularity in integrable, which leads to non-singular behavior for the charge Q P G . This singularity is resolved in the more accurate model (Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref>, 1986). Summing the displacement and conduction currents, we obtain for the total currents I rf (t) = I P G (t) + I i ; 0 &lt; !t (mod 2) &lt; ; (16) as shown in Figure 4c. <p> We compare this simple analytic model with the more accurate numerical results of Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref> (1986) in Figure 5. Now consider the opposite limit of a small blocking capacitor where the impedance of the blocking capacitor C b is large, and the discharge is essentially current driven. <p> These can be compared with the IEDs derived from the voltage waveforms of the the more accurate Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref> (1986) model. [See Figure 10]. From the model, we see that, for t ion =t rf t 1, the voltage drops across the sheaths are non-sinusoidal due to the non-linear properties of the sheath capacitances and the conduction currents. <p> This implies that ions are accelerated by a small potential drop for a larger fraction of the rf cycle than for a large potential drop. This effect results in IEDs with dominant low energy peaks. The more accurate numerical model of Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref> (1986) shows similar results. 2.4 Numerical Model for t ion =t rf t 1 Metze et al [42] (1986) presented a numerical model for a collisonless planar rf plasma reactor valid in the low frequency regime (t ion =t rf t 1). <p> This effect results in IEDs with dominant low energy peaks. The more accurate numerical model of Metze et al <ref> [42] </ref> (1986) shows similar results. 2.4 Numerical Model for t ion =t rf t 1 Metze et al [42] (1986) presented a numerical model for a collisonless planar rf plasma reactor valid in the low frequency regime (t ion =t rf t 1). <p> From Figure 11a, note that V s (t) &lt; 0 because V = 0 is chosen at the plasma which is always charged positive with respect to the electrodes. al <ref> [42] </ref>.
