Abstract: We give efficient algorithms for solving several geometric problems in computational metrology, focusing on the fundamental issues of "flatness" and "roundness." Specifically, we give approximate and exact algorithms for 2- and 3-dimensional roundness primitives, deriving results that improve previous approaches in several respects, including problem definition, running time, underlying computational model, and dimensionality of the input. We also study methods for determining the width of a d-dimensional point set, which corresponds to the metrology notion of "flatness," giving an approximation method that can serve as a fast exact-computation filter for this metrology primitive. Finally, we report on experimental results derived from implementation and testing, particularly in 3-space, of our approximation algorithms, including several heuristics designed to significantly speed-up the computations in practice.

Reference-contexts: Their methods are based upon well-established computational geometry computations, including convex hull construction and line-segment intersection (e.g., see [17, 28]), and they can even be implemented in the rational-RAM computation model, where all arithmetic is performed exactly on rational numbers. Several computational geometry researchers <ref> [1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 21, 30, 35] </ref> have studied the width problem further. <p> There has also been some interest in the computational geometry community on various 2-dimensional problems related to "roundness" <ref> [5, 6, 16, 22, 33, 35, 37] </ref>. <p> the input set S of n points in the plane. (Recall that an annulus A of radius A and width 0 ! A 2 A is the region between two concentric circles of radius A + ! A =2 and A ! A =2.) Ebara et al. [16] (see also <ref> [22, 35] </ref>) study the minimum-width annulus problem, where one wishes to find an annulus A that minimizes the quantity ! A (over all annuli in the plane). <p> They show that the center of a minimum-width annulus containing S must be at a vertex of the farthest-neighbor or nearest-neighbor Voronoi diagrams (allowing for vertices at infinity <ref> [35] </ref>) or at an intersection point between these two diagrams. This, of course, leads to an O (n 2 )-time algorithm, which can be implemented in the rational-RAM model.

Reference-contexts: We refer to these two problems, respectively, as the decision and optimization versions of the referenced roundness problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we are interested in the design of efficient, easy-to-implement algorithms for performing such metrology primitives, with particular attention focused on the fundamental issues of "flatness" and "roundness" <ref> [38] </ref>. 1.1 Previous Related Work. <p> Interestingly, the specific problem they address, which they called the width problem, corresponds exactly to the mathematical notion of "flatness" that is used in the computational metrology community (e.g., see <ref> [38] </ref>). In this problem one is given a set S of n points in IR d and asked to find a closest pair of parallel hyperplanes in IR d that contain all the points of S on or between them.
