Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Mobile robots operating in vast outdoor unstructured environments often only have incomplete maps and must deal with new objects found during traversal. Path planning in such sparsely occupied regions must be incremental to accommodate new information, and, must use efficient representations. In previous work we have developed an optimal method, D*, to plan paths in which the environment is not known ahead of time, but, rather is discovered as the robot moves around. Like many other algorithms that use a discretized representation of the world, D* uses an uniform grid to represent areas that are occupied and those that are free. In this paper we propose an extension, the use of framed quadtrees, to improve efficiency of planning paths in sparse environments. The new system has been tested in simulation as well on a autonomous jeep, equipped with local obstacle avoidance capabilities. We show how the use of framed quadtrees improves performance in terms of path length, computation speed, and memory requirements.

Reference-contexts: Our vehicle uses a vertical-baseline stereo system to generate range images. The resulting images are processed by the SMARTY local navigator <ref> [1] </ref>, which handles local obstacle detection and avoidance. This obstacle map is then fed to a path planner, such as Framed-Quadtree D*. The path planner offers steering advice to the local navigator by voting on steering angles, an approach described in [3].

Reference-contexts: This obstacle map is then fed to a path planner, such as Framed-Quadtree D*. The path planner offers steering advice to the local navigator by voting on steering angles, an approach described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Fig. 12 shows the system modules and data ow. The first set of tests showed that Framed-Quadtree D* remedies one drawback of Regular-Grid D*, the inability to drive a straight diagonal traverse, in certain cases, through an empty area. The results are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we concentrate the discussion on global planning. Approaches to path planning for mobile robots can be broadly classified into two categories those that use exact representations of the world that the robot must operate in (e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>), and those that use a discretized representation (e.g. [6]). The main advantage of the discretiza-tion is that we can control the computational complexity of path planning by adjusting the cell size to the need of the task on hand.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a new data structure called a Framed-Quadtree has been suggested as means to overcome some of the issues related to the use of quadtrees <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In completely known environments, where the state of the world is fixed and known in advance, the two produce the same path. However, when confronted with incremental information about the environment, D* has been shown to be superior to A* <ref> [8] </ref>. 4 Simulation Results in a Rectangle World We ran simulations to compare the performance of D* implementations on the Framed-Quadtree and the Regular-Grid representation in dynamic environments, where the robot discovers new obstacles and replans its path using D* while traversing.

Our plan-ner, called D*, has been shown to be optimal in terms of incrementally discovered information about the world [8][9]. D* is an incremental version of a popular search algorithm known as A* <ref> [10] </ref>. This new implementation addresses the weaknesses of the previous system, especially for sparse environments. We call the previous system Regular-Grid D*; the new system Framed-Quadtree D*. We present simulation results showing the advantages of our new system.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 below shows a typical path generated using Regu lar-Grid representation in a static environment. The black cul-de-sac is an obstacle. 2.2 Traditional-Quadtree One way to solve the problems of Regular-Grid representation is to use a Quadtree data structure <ref> [11] </ref> to represent the environment, instead of using regular size cells. A Quadtree [11][12] is based on the successive subdivision of region into four equally sized quadrants. The quadrants are labelled NE (Northeast), NW (Northwest), SW (SouthWest), and SE (Southeast) respectively.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to produce a path based on all available information and replan from the current position to the goal every time new information is discovered. This is called Best Information Planning. This approach <ref> [13] </ref> is intuitively satisfying and has been shown to produce lower-cost traverses than other selected algorithms for unknown and partially-known environments. Furthermore, Best Information Planning is able to make use of prior information to reduce the traversal cost.
