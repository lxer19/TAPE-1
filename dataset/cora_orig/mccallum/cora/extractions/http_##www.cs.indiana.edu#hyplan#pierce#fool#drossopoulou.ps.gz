Title: Is the Java Type System Sound?

Abstract: We argue that the Java type system is sound, by proving a subject reduction theorem. We define a subset of Java, a language which is safe and which reflects the most essential features of Java, a term rewriting system for the operational semantics and a type inference system to describe compile time type checking. We prove that program execution preserves the types, up to the subclass/subinterface relationship.
