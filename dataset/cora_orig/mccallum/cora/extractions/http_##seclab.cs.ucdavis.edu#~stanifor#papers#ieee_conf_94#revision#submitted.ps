Title: Holding Intruders Accountable on the Internet  
Author: Stuart Staniford-Chen L. Todd Heberlein

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracing intruders who obscure their identity by logging through a chain of multiple machines. After discussing previous approaches to this problem, we introduce thumbprints which are short summaries of the content of a connection. These can be compared to determine whether two connections contain the same text and are therefore likely to be part of the same connection chain. We enumerate the properties a thumbprint needs to have to work in practice, and then define a class of local thumbprints which have the desired properties. A methodology from multivariate statistics called principal component analysis is used to infer the best choice of thumbprinting parameters from data. Currently our thumbprints require 24 bytes per minute per connection. We develop an algorithm to compare these thumbprints which allows for the possibility that data may leak from one time-interval to the next. We present experimental data showing that our scheme works on a local area network.

Reference-contexts: In just the first six months of 1994, that number had grown to 1172. In addition to the growth in the number of reported incidents, the number of systems involved per incident is growing one recent incident involved 65; 000 systems. <ref> [1] </ref> Furthermore, it seems probable that most incidents are not reported. For example, ASSIST, the Department of Defense incident response team, recently evaluated the security level of one of their sites by launching automated attacks against it continuously for two months. Only one person reported suspicious activity. <p> More importantly, under the null hypothesis that C and C 0 are independently and randomly chosen connections, the p t are random variables drawn from a uniform distribution on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Thus when we take their product, the result is drawn from the distribution of the product of s U (0; 1) distributions. <p> The histogram of the obtained values of l pair is shown in Figure 3 as the dotted line. The solid line is the curve that would apply if successive values of p t were independent so that p pair was distributed uni formly on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Clearly (as expected) this assumption is violated and thus comparisons between unrelated connections tend to be more significant than this assumption would allow. However, it is not so grossly wrong as to make us abandon the natural comparison suggested in and immediately after equation (12).

One of the intruder's greatest fears is losing his or her anonymity. <ref> [4] </ref> Unfortunately, attackers can take advantage of the architecture of the Internet to hide their point of origin, thus preserving their anonymity. Since many hosts are insecure, intruders assemble a collection of accounts on hosts around the world that they have broken into.

Reference-contexts: Clifford Stoll's experience is a good example. <ref> [5] </ref> Because of these problems, most incident response teams such as CERT make little or no effort to find the intruder. The result: an intruder still has all the potential rewards with almost no risks.

Reference-contexts: In the first class are methods which attempt to keep track of all individuals on the network and account all activity to network wide user-ids. The DIDS system developed at UC Davis is an example of a system which did this for a single local area network. <ref> [6] </ref> We believe that, while this approach may be a good idea for a wide area network which is under central administration, it is not feasible on the Internet with its diversity of administrations, operating systems, and security policies. The second class contains reactive tracing mechanisms. <p> were compression techniques, and signature retrieval techniques (as used in the search of large free-text databases). [10] 3.4 Applicability In the short term, we see several applications in which this kind of technology could be deployed almost immediately. 1) In the context of distributed intrusion detection systems such as DIDS <ref> [6] </ref>, thumbprinting could allow the system to relate activity which went outside the domain but then re-entered. This might be important when an inside attacker was seeking to disguise himself as an outsider.

Reference-contexts: It seems that it would be likely to induce excessive delays in some cases however. A different approach was actually used by the United States Air Force to track an intruder and arrest him. <ref> [8] </ref> This technique, confusingly called Caller ID also, is controversial and required special permission from the Department of Justice, so it is probably not a technique for general use.

Reference-contexts: We note that since the thumbprints are very small, it is usually impossible to deduce details of the connection content from them. This limits their impact on privacy to traffic analysis. 3 Thumbprinting 3.1 Idea The idea of a thumbprint, which was originally proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>, is a small quantity which effectively summarizes a certain section of a connection.

Reference-contexts: They are also not additive. Message digest algorithms have the same drawbacks. Other possibilities we considered and ruled out due to space considerations were compression techniques, and signature retrieval techniques (as used in the search of large free-text databases). <ref> [10] </ref> 3.4 Applicability In the short term, we see several applications in which this kind of technology could be deployed almost immediately. 1) In the context of distributed intrusion detection systems such as DIDS [6], thumbprinting could allow the system to relate activity which went outside the domain but then re-entered.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, we have found that ASCII character 24 plays a peculiar role in our data. This character is used by the telnet protocol as part of its negotiation over which terminal type is in use <ref> [11] </ref>. Normally, this character is very infrequent. However, in a very few of our connections, massive numbers of these appear (tens or hundreds of thousands per minute). We do not presently understand the cause of this, though we suspect an implementation bug in some version of telnet.

Reference-contexts: The question that must be addressed is which linear combinations of the f i should be used? Happily, statisticians have developed a machinery for answering this kind of question known as principal component analysis. Since this technique is well discussed in textbooks <ref> [12, 13] </ref>, and we do not have the space for a full treatment, we will only describe it briefly.

Reference-contexts: So although the total amount of traffic crossing a large internetwork may be enormous, the portion of the traffic in which we are interested is quite small. For example, we looked at the traffic statistics for the NSFNET internetwork <ref> [14] </ref>. For November 1994, the combined rlogin and telnet traffic of 1:024 fi 10 12 bytes, accounted for only 4.56% of the total traffic. Distributed evenly over the month, we find the data rate to be 3:95 fi 10 5 bytes per second.

Reference-contexts: A, on dimensional grounds, must be proportional to P n1 . Thus F (Y ) = C 1 where C is an unknown constant. This integral is a standard form <ref> [15] </ref>, and the result is F (Y ) = Ce Y i=0 i! (25) The requirement that F (Y ) = 1 at Y = 0 then fixes the unknown constant C at C = (n 1)! Since Y = log z we can deduce the cfd for z as F
