Reference-contexts: Algebraically, a conditional num ber can be expressed in the following disjoint sum-of-products (DSOP) form: (2.1) where is an orthonormal set of -variable Boolean functions <ref> [1] </ref> and are the correspond ing real values of . The set will be referred to as the Boolean basis . The logical AND and XOR operators in (2.1) are extended to handle the reals according to the rules: (2.2) where and . <p> Generally speaking, a partially specified n-variable Boolean function is a nonempty subset of the func tion space representing all completely specified -variable Boolean functions. A partially specified function is a function interval <ref> [1] </ref> if it can be expressed as (2.7) where and are two -variable Boolean functions such that . A function interval can be viewed as a mapping , where is the set of intervals on , and can thus be equivalently expressed as .

Reference-contexts: This immediately led to the consideration of inertial filtering mechanisms to block the transmission of the narrow pulses that are produced as a result of asymmetric delays. The recently proposed state-dependent delay models <ref> [2, 4] </ref> intertwine functionality and timing even more closely by distinguishing among the various input conditions that produce functionally similar but temporally different output responses.

Reference-contexts: The temporal and Boolean aspects of the waveform function are separable in the sense that the functional dependence on are distinctly different <ref> [3, p. 23] </ref>. As noted earlier, when the value of is fixed becomes a ternary function of . This can be expressed formally by the mapping (3.2) which assigns a ternary function of time to each element and allows us to separate the arguments of by expressing it as .
