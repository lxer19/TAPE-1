Abstract: P/poly, the class of sets with polynomial size circuits, has been the subject of considerable study in complexity theory. Two important subclasses of P/poly are the class of sparse sets [6] and the class of P-selective sets [31]. A large number of results have been proved about both these classes but it has been observed (for example, [17]) that despite their similarity, proofs about one class generally do not translate easily to proofs regarding the other class. In this note, we propose to resolve this asymmetry by investigating the class PSEL-close of sets that are polynomially close to P-selective sets; by definition, PSEL-close includes both sparse sets and P-selective sets, thereby providing a unifying platform for proving results applicable to both. Intuitively, PSEL-close is the class of sets that can in a certain sense be approximated by P-selective sets. We prove several results separating PSEL-close from known classes within and including P/poly, and establish its location optimally in the extended low hierarchy. We illustrate the naturalness and usefulness of the class by examining the question of whether sets hard for NP or E can be PSEL-close; several well-known results are obtained as immediate corollaries.

Intuitively, a set in P-close can be "approximated" by a set in P, i.e., there exists a fast (polynomial-time) decision algorithm for the set that is correct on all but polynomially many instances at any given size. <p> The following was proved in <ref> [30] </ref>: Proposition 3.4 APT P-close P/poly. We first establish the relation of PSEL-close with P/poly by showing that PSEL-close is strictly included in P/poly. Theorem 3.5 PSEL-close P/poly. Proof: The inclusion of PSEL-close in P/poly is straightforward: Let A 2 PSEL-close. <p> Proposition 3.9 APT 6 PSEL. Proof: Let T be the tally set from the proof of Theorem 3.5 such that T 62 PSEL and T 2 E. Since every recursive tally set is easily seen to be in APT, T 2 APT. 2 Corollary 3.10 1. P 6= APT <ref> [30] </ref>. 2. PSEL 6= APSEL. 3. P-close 6 PSEL. Proposition 3.11 P-close 6 APSEL.

We note that Theorem 3.14 also yields the following corollary that answers an open question of Schoning <ref> [30] </ref>: Corollary 3.16 If there exists a p m -hard set for NP that is P-close, then P = NP. The original theorem of Schoning required that the p m -hard set also be paddable. <p> The following is immediate. Proposition 3.18 Let A p m C via f which is 1-1 a.e. If C is P-selective, then A is P-selective. The following lemma is similar to the ones used in [6] and <ref> [30] </ref>. Lemma 3.19 There exists a set A in E such that the following hold: 1. Every p m -reduction f from A to another set is 1-1 a.e. 2. <p> The following well-known results are now easily obtained. Corollary 3.21 1. No P-close set is p m -hard for E <ref> [30] </ref>. 2. No sparse set is p m -hard for E [6]. 3.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Sets with "low information content" have been a subject of considerable interest in contemporary complexity theory. Prominent examples of such sets are the classes of sparse sets [6] and P-selective sets <ref> [31] </ref>. Both are subclasses of P/poly, the class of sets with polynomial size circuits [20]. The importance of low sets arises from the fact that the property of being hard for a class such as NP is incompatible with the property of having low information content. <p> On the other hand, such a result was established early in the study of P-selective sets: Selman <ref> [31] </ref> proved that (a) P-selective sets are closed under p m reductions and (b) if SAT is P-selective, then P = NP. <p> This result, obtained via an interesting combination of ordering and pruning techniques from the study of P-selective and sparse sets respectively, yields the results of Mahaney [24] and Selman <ref> [31] </ref> for sparse and P-selective sets respectively as immediate corollaries. We also note that the corresponding corollary that can be obtained for P-close sets answers an open question of Schoning [30] by removing the reliance on a paddability assumption. <p> P-selectivity was introduced by Selman as a polynomial-time analog of the recursion theoretic concept of semirecursiveness [19] : 3 Definition 2.4 <ref> [31] </ref> A set A is P-selective if and only if there exists a polynomial-time computable function (p-selector) f : fl fi fl ! fl such that the following two conditions hold for all x; y 2 fl : 1. f (x; y) 2 fx; yg, and PSEL denotes the class of <p> The result, which was obtained via an elegant combination of ordering and pruning techniques from the study of P-selective and sparse sets respectively, yields the well-known results of Mahaney [24] and Selman <ref> [31] </ref> for sparse and P-selective sets respectively as immediate corollaries. Theorem 3.14 ([12]) If there exists a p m -hard set A for NP such that A 2 PSEL-close, then P = NP. Corollary 3.15 1. <p> Corollary 3.15 1. If there exists a p m -hard set for NP that is sparse, then P = NP [24]. 2. If there exists a p m -hard set for NP that is P-selective, then P = NP <ref> [31] </ref>. We note that Theorem 3.14 also yields the following corollary that answers an open question of Schoning [30]: Corollary 3.16 If there exists a p m -hard set for NP that is P-close, then P = NP.

Sets A and B are said to be polynomially close if and only if AB is a sparse set. Schoning studied the class P-close of sets polynomially close to sets in P [30].
