Reference-contexts: Another feature of several developed parallel operating systems is the support of multiple threads of control where code and data are shared by multiple threads of execution. Implementation of multiple threads can be seen in systems such as the Mach distributed system kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University <ref> [1] </ref> and Topaz, the software system for the Firey Multiprocessor Workstation developed at Digital Equipment 29 Corporation Systems Research Center.[19] Cheops hardware could support multiple threads because memory on remote boards able to be accessed by any processor.

Reference-contexts: I will not go into extensive detail here describing the exact methods of filtering because scalable video does not necessarily need to be represented by the use of subband coding. Other hierarchical means of representation are available (such as Laplacian Pyramids, see <ref> [2] </ref>) which are scalable in nature. Furthermore, the specific type of subband coding used in this research is not important. For reasons of convenience, I have chosen to use 2-D subband coding to effect scalable video, which I will describe later.

Reference-contexts: Magic Seven included a monitor, useful for low level debugging and performing multi-tasking process control operations. The Magic Seven operating system was expanded to allow interprocess communication, including advanced communication with the host by Hewlett and Becker.[12] Application software has been developed based upon the client-server model <ref> [6] </ref>. A resource manager for Cheops was recently completed by Irene Shen.[16] This resource manager schedules and monitors application tasks for each stream resource. A stream resource is a special purpose device located on a Cheops processor module.

Reference-contexts: Instead, it is represented as a set of spatiotemporal components from which displays of almost any frame and line rate can be constructed [5] These variables are all adjusted by the receiver, not defined by the transmitter. For a complete discussion of scalable video, see <ref> [8] </ref>. In a scalable television system, video data can be visualized as a owing river of information, from which each receiver can retrieve as much or as little information as it wants. (see Figure 1.).

Reference-contexts: One coding technique which meets this scalable video data 640x480, 30 fps, 640x480, higher resolution higher resolution lower resolution 16 requirement is pyramid coding, developed by Burt and Adelson <ref> [9] </ref>. In their work, the image is represented by a series of bands of descending resolution each sampled at successively lower rates. Pyramid coding is hierarchical in that these successive bands may be sent progressively with the image improving as each band is received.

Reference-contexts: The LOCUS and NFS systems use a message passing system which may be traced back to early systems developed at Carnegie Mellon such as HYDRA, the kernel of an operating system for C.mmp [24], and StarOS, a multiprocessor operating system for the support of task forces <ref> [13] </ref>. Cheops is similar to these systems in that it is utilizes network based client-server communication with remote procedure calling. Cheops utilizes a similar, scaled down version of the client-server model for interprocess communication.

Reference-contexts: The following is a brief look at some features of operating systems developed in parallel environments: 1 Distributed Implementations of Conventional Operating Systems. The LOCUS System, developed and used at the University of California at Los Angeles <ref> [15] </ref> and the Sun Network File System (NFS)[18] have demonstrated 28 the adaptation of previous, non-parallel systems to parallel environments. Both of these systems provide transparent access of remote files. All UNIX file access functions were necessarily adapted from existing systems to provide access to remote file servers.

Reference-contexts: A callback routine is called by the manager when the transfer is complete. The actual transfer is very fast. We have found that in practice, it is instantaneous compared to all the overhead involved in reading in data, bitstream dequantizing it (i.e. dequantization), and queue construction.

Reference-contexts: In the Open Architecture approach to television research, television is described by the number of features or degrees of freedom in the system.[8] The Entertainment Information Group has conducted many experiments in developing scalable video. (see, for example <ref> [17] </ref>). In keeping with the MIT Media Lab tradition of creating the tools with which we can conduct research, the Cheops Imaging System, a modular processor for scalable video decoding, has been developed. Cheops was designed as a multiprocessing engine because scalable video lends itself to a parallel environment.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage to this system in video display system development is the reconstruction computations are simple, local and may be performed in parallel. Another similar coding scheme, and the one I have used in this thesis, is subband coding, developed by Woods and ONeil <ref> [23] </ref>. In subband coding, the bands are not obtained interatively, but instead as parallel bands obtained through the use of bandpass filters. This scheme is advantageous in that the reconstruction of the bands is obtained through a simple filter-add operation, and the bands are the same size and parallel.
