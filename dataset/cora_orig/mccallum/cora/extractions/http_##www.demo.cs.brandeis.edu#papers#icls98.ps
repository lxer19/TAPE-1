Abstract: We discuss the co-evolutionary learning method, applied to human learning, as a means toward a mediated, competitively motivated, educational environment on the Internet. This method was developed in our work with machine learners, where we have been examining environmental characteristics that enable successful and effective learning through "self-play" in games. Critical features include the ability to provide tasks consistently just beyond or just within a learner's grasp. We carry these observations into the human education arena, using them to help us enable a Community of Evolving Learners (CEL) on the Internet. This paper describes the design of the CEL system.

Early Intelligent Tutoring Systems often tried to model human learning by carefully engineering training environments <ref> [Soloway et al., 1981, Anderson, 1982, Kolodner, 1983] </ref>. More recent efforts make use of the Internet to provide, for example, collaborative learning spaces, curriculum sequencing, solution analysis and adaptive presentation [Suthers et al., 1995, Brusilovsky et al., 1996, Bruckman, 1997].

Reference-contexts: One simple reporting mechanism is a hall of fame, which displays a straightforward ranking of the players in the system, similar to that in a traditional video game. In earlier work <ref> [Funes et al., 1998] </ref>, we found several players returning to our game-playing web site in order to outdo each other.

Reference-contexts: In artificial co-evolutionary learning 1 , the learning environment automatically and incrementally becomes more challenging as the learner advances often because the environment consists of other learners <ref> [Hillis, 1992, Sims, 1995, Pollack & Blair, 1998] </ref>. We carry these ideas into the human education arena and use them to construct a co-evolutionary tutoring system called the Community of Evolving Learners (CEL).

Reference-contexts: The use of competition in academics particularly in the United States is quite controversial and has been eliminated in many school districts. <ref> [Kohn, 1986] </ref> has mustered strong evidence that competitive games in classrooms lead to lower educational outcomes; as motivators, they hurt more students than they help. However, we hypothesize that the difficulty may lie in repeated competition inside one classroom, with local peers.

Reference-contexts: System Overview The CEL system, implemented using Java and released on the Internet, injects specific curricular activities into a multi-user environment (see figure 1). Inside, simple competitive games 2 help users reinforce basic arithmetic and language 3 skills, targeted (though not restricted) to primary grades <ref> [Sklar et al., 1998] </ref>. Software agents act as learning partners, mediating interactions. In this way, communication between users is considered indirect, a methodology which distinguishes our work from others in which users interface directly via a "chat" mechanism.
