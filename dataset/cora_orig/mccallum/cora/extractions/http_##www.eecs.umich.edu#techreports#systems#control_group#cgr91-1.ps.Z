Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of designing a compensating control law for a (left-invertible) nonlinear plant so that the response of the closed-loop system asymptotically matches that of a prescribed, driven, nonlinear model. A new formulation of the problem is developed and sets of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for its solvability are given. Under a regularity hypothesis, a "fixed" dynamics that is common to every model matching closed-loop is identified. The interrelation between certain qualitative properties of a plant and a matchable model are studied.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The problem of compensating a plant in order to match the input-output behavior of a given model has been extensively investigated for linear systems (see e.g. [25], [27], [28], [33], and the references therein) as well as for nonlinear systems (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], [8], [10], [18], [19], [21], [22], and [26]).

The asymptotic version of the problem of [10] has been investigated for special classes of nonlinear systems in <ref> [4, 18] </ref> where it was referred to as model matching with prescribed tracking error.

Concerning how the problem has been formulated elsewhere in the literature, whenever the model matching problem of <ref> [10] </ref> is solvable, the exact model matching problem from the origin is also. In general, the converse is false, as was shown in the Introduction, but it does hold for linear models and statically input-output linearizable plants [22]. <p> In general, the converse is false, as was shown in the Introduction, but it does hold for linear models and statically input-output linearizable plants [22].

Conclusions In this paper, we have addressed the problem of compensating a nonlinear system so as to asymptotically match a driven nonlinear model. A set of fixed dynamics common to any closed loop achieving model matching was identified.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The problem of compensating a plant in order to match the input-output behavior of a given model has been extensively investigated for linear systems (see e.g. [25], [27], [28], [33], and the references therein) as well as for nonlinear systems (e.g. [4], [5], [8], [10], [18], [19], [21], <ref> [22] </ref>, and [26]). The solution of this problem is of particular interest, especially in the case of nonlinear systems, for its importance in describing control specifications. In addition, its study provides theoretical insight into the structural properties that can be achieved in the closed loop. <p> In general, the converse is false, as was shown in the Introduction, but it does hold for linear models and statically input-output linearizable plants <ref> [22] </ref>. In a recent paper [19], necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the solvability of the model matching problem of [10]. From the previous discussion, these conditions are sufficient but not necessary for achieving exact model matching from the origin.

Reference-contexts: Finally, at least on the surface, there seems to be a strong connection between the model matching and the regulator or servomechanism problems ([17], <ref> [23] </ref>); in each case, one specifies the desired closed-loop behavior by an "external system". For model matching, the external system is driven and asymptotically stable. For output regulation, it is undriven and neutrally stable. In other words, the hypotheses imposed on the external system are disjoint. 6 3.

In the Appendix, the relation with the fundamental work of <ref> [28] </ref> is indicated. In particular, the decomposition of the fixed modes into the dynamics of the model and a subset of the plant's zero-dynamics is shown. 2.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the same result would hold for a global version of the model matching problem. 2 For linear systems, the equivalence between the model matching problem and an associated disturbance decoupling problem was established in [11]. Similar results for nonlinear systems were shown in [10] and [19]; see <ref> [30] </ref> for disturbance decoupling with internal stability. The equivalence between the model matching problem of Definition 2.1 and an associated (asymptotic) disturbance decoupling problem is easily seen by viewing the input v in (2.3) as a disturbance that is to be (asymptotically) rejected.

In deriving our results, a left-invertibility assumption was crucial in that it led to a kind of uniqueness property of the class of solutions.
