Abstract: Agent communication can be in the service of many different possible goals, or even many simultaneous goals. One such goal is inter-agent coordinationmanaging the complex interdependencies between agent activities. Our model of coordination suggests that communicative acts in service of coordination are based on the detection and response to certain coordination relationships that exist between interrelated sets of tasks known by multiple agents. These relationships indicate both when results should be communicated (`technical' communication directly in the service of problem solving), as well as when meta-level (`decision-oriented') information should be communicated. We will illustrate this with an example in the hospital scheduling domain. This position paper will briefly discuss how agents may generate communicative goals for coordination, how they may rely on the recipient's inferences to achieve those goals, be sensitive to prior plans and communications, and carry out concurrent execution in time-sensitive domains using Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). GPGP is a family of coordination mechanisms for multi-agent teams that generates communication actions in a domain-independent manner, while working in 1 Our model of multi-agent problem solving conjunction with an existing agent planner/scheduler.

Reference-contexts: 1 Our model of multi-agent problem solving Communicative actions can have technical, `meta-level' decision-oriented (i.e. economic-rational), political, or symbolic origins <ref> [ Adler and Borys, 1993 ] </ref> . Technical communicative actions are concerned directly with problem solving; meta-level decision-oriented communicative actions with rational decision making; political communicative actions with power and authority; symbolic communicative actions with expressions of (social) solidarity.

Reference-contexts: The non-local aspect of communication decision-making in the service of coordination is quite different from that in [ Durfee et al., 1987 ] , and more like the communication to resolve solution uncertainty used in DRESUN <ref> [ Carver et al., 1991 ] </ref> . We gave examples of such `meta-level' decision-oriented communications in hospital scheduling system. Technical communication (such as patient delivery requests) at each agent was supplanted or extended by meta-level communication for coordination (such as notifying nurses about the patient's future delivery time).

All modules rest on a shared substrate that acts as the agent's central decision-maker, deciding on which plan/schedule to follow and when to terminate processing on a problem.

However, TMS can model in more detail the physical resources and job shop characteristics of the ancillaries if necessary <ref> [ Decker and Lesser, 1993b ] </ref> . In Ow's case study, he found that the nurses would communicate each patient's request for treatment to each ancillary. Each ancillary would then schedule the procedure immediately, but only notify the nursing unit a short time before the treatment was to occur.
