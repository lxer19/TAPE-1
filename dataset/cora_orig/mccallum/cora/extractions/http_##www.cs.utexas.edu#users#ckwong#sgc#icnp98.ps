Title: Digital Signatures for Flows and Multicasts

Abstract: We present chaining techniques for signing/verifying multiple packets using a single signing/verification operation. We then present flow signing and verification procedures based upon a tree chaining technique. Since a single signing/verification operation is amortized over many packets, these procedures improve signing and verification rates by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the approach of signing/verifying packets individually. Our procedures do not depend upon reliable delivery of packets, provide delay-bounded signing, and are thus suitable for delay-sensitive flows and multicast applications. To further improve our procedures, we propose several extensions to the Feige-Fiat-Shamir digital signature scheme to speed up both the signing and verification operations, as well as to allow adjustable and incremental verification. The extended scheme, called eFFS, is compared to four other digital signature schemes (RSA, DSA, ElGamal, Rabin). We compare their signing and verification times, as well as key and signature sizes. We observe that (i) the signing and verification operations of eFFS are highly efficient compared to the other schemes, (ii) eFFS allows a tradeoff between memory and signing/verification time, and (iii) eFFS allows adjustable and incremental verification by receivers.

Reference-contexts: For example, reliable delivery is generally not used for video and audio flows due to the extra delays associated with retransmissions; either losses are tolerated or forward error correction techniques are used instead. For large-scale multicast applications, reliable delivery of multicast packets is a difficult problem <ref> [5] </ref>. Moreover, even if reliable multicasting is available, receivers with different needs/capabilities may choose to get different subsequences of packets in a multicasted flow. In short, the get-all-before requirement is not satisfied. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, our concerns are data authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation for delay-sensitive packet flows, particularly flows to be delivered to large groups of receivers. For an individual message (packet), these concerns can be addressed by one of many available digital signature schemes <ref> [6, 15, 17, 19] </ref>. However, these schemes are not efficient enough for signing/verifying packets individually for delay-sensitive flows, such as packet video. In the Internet, multicast has been used successfully to provide an efficient, best-effort delivery service to large groups [2]. <p> Specifically, we present several extensions to the Feige-Fiat-Shamir digital signature scheme to speed up both signing and verification as well as to allow adjustable and incremental verification. In Section 4, the extended Feige-Fiat-Shamir (eFFS) scheme is compared to four well-known signature schemes <ref> [6, 15, 17, 19] </ref>. We compare their signing and verification times, as well as key and signature sizes. <p> Comparison with other Signature Schemes In this section, we compare eFFS (128,1) to four other signature schemes available from CryptoLib [8], namely: DSA [15], ElGamal <ref> [6] </ref>, RSA [19], and Rabin [17]. We compare their key and signature sizes, and signing and verification times. Then, we compare their signing and verification rates for 1024-byte packets when each is used as the signature scheme in our flow signing and verification procedures presented in Section 2. <p> The extended scheme, called eFFS, is compared to four other digital signature schemes, RSA [19], Ra-bin [17], DSA [15], and ElGamal <ref> [6] </ref>, on the same computing platform (Pentium II 300 MHz machine running Linux). The signing operation of eFFS is more efficient than those of the other four schemes.

Reference-contexts: From the table, we see that the signing and verification rates of the sign-each approach, using either RSA or DSA, are probably inadequate for many applications. Two techniques were proposed for signing digital streams in <ref> [7] </ref> which, at first glance, may be used for signing packet flows. To describe the technique in [7] for signing a non-real-time generated flow, consider a sequence of m packets. <p> Two techniques were proposed for signing digital streams in <ref> [7] </ref> which, at first glance, may be used for signing packet flows. To describe the technique in [7] for signing a non-real-time generated flow, consider a sequence of m packets. The sender first computes message digest D m of packet m (the last packet) and concatenates packet m 1 and D m to form augmented packet m 1. <p> However, a necessary condition for using the above technique is the following get-all-before requirement: To verify packet i in the sequence, a receiver must have received every packet from the beginning of the sequence. For a real-time generated flow, a similar technique is suggested in <ref> [7] </ref> with the same get-all-before requirement. For a sequence of m packets, only one expensive signing/verification operation is needed, plus one inexpensive one-time signature signing/verification for each packet in the sequence. <p> However, since one-time signatures and keys are very large, this technique has a large communication overhead (around 1000 bytes per packet) [9, 10]. The get-all-before requirement of both techniques in <ref> [7] </ref> is too strong for practical Internet applications. Reliable packet delivery is not used by many applications for flows and multicasts. <p> Contributions of this paper In Section 2, we first describe and compare two chaining techniques (star and tree) for signing/verifying multiple packets using a single signing/verification operation (without the get-all-before requirement in <ref> [7] </ref>). We then present flow signing and verification procedures based upon the tree chaining technique. Since a single signing/verification operation is amortized over many packets, these procedures improve signing and verification rates by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the sign-each approach.

In Section 3.1, we describe the basic Feige-Fiat-Shamir signature scheme.

In Section 3.3, we propose to use a speedup technique suggested by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (crt), which reduces signing time. <p> Small verification key components In FFS, the sizes of signing key components fs i g affect the signing time, and the sizes of verification key components fv i g affect the verification time. An improvement idea suggested in <ref> [12] </ref> is to use small prime numbers 11 as the verification key components fv i g and compute the signing key components fs i g by s 2 i = v 1 i mod n. This improvement (labeled as small v-key in Table 6 and Table 7) has two advantages. <p> This Chinese Remainder Theorem improvement can only be used by a signer because knowledge of the factors of modulus n is required. It reduces the signing time by 11 Actually, <ref> [12] </ref> suggests using the first k prime numbers as the verification key components fv i g.
