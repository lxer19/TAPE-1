Abstract: Sequences of events describing the behavior and actions of users or systems can be collected in several domains. In this paper we consider the problem of recognizing frequent episodes in such sequences of events. An episode is defined to be a collection of events that occur within time intervals of a given size in a given partial order. Once such episodes are known, one can produce rules for describing or predicting the behavior of the sequence. We describe an efficient algorithm for the discovery of all frequent episodes from a given class of episodes, and present experimental results.

Reference-contexts: Also, comparable strategies using a sliding window have been used e.g. to study locality of reference in virtual memory (Denning 1968). The methods for matching sets of episodes against a sequence have some similarities to the algorithms used in string matching (see <ref> (Aho 1990) </ref> for a survey). Similarly, the work on learning regular languages from strings has some similarities to our work. However, in string matching or learning regular languages one typically is interested in finding substrings where there may not be interleaved events within an occurrence of an episode.

Reference-contexts: In active databases a related problem is the efficient detection of trigger events (see e.g. (Gehani, Jagadish, & Shmueli 1992)).

Reference-contexts: Taking advantage of the slowly changing contents of the group of recent events in the recognition phase has been studied under different fields. Within AI, a similar problem in spirit is the many pattern/many object pattern match problem in production system interpreters (see e.g. <ref> (Forgy 1982) </ref>). In active databases a related problem is the efficient detection of trigger events (see e.g. (Gehani, Jagadish, & Shmueli 1992)). Also, comparable strategies using a sliding window have been used e.g. to study locality of reference in virtual memory (Denning 1968).

Reference-contexts: We have implemented our method and used it in the analysis of telecommunication network alarm data. The discovered episodes have been considered useful by domain experts. Related work For an excellent survey on patterns in sequential data, see <ref> (Laird 1993) </ref>. Wang et al. consider the problem of discovering patterns from a number of input sequences. Their algorithm finds patterns that are similar to serial episodes, with respect to given minimum length, edit distance, and frequency threshold.

Reference-contexts: Wang et al. consider the problem of discovering patterns from a number of input sequences. Their algorithm finds patterns that are similar to serial episodes, with respect to given minimum length, edit distance, and frequency threshold. They also consider probabilistic pruning of patterns by using sampling <ref> (Wang et al. 1994) </ref>. The idea of building candidate patterns from smaller ones has been profitably used in the discovery of association rules (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1994; Agrawal & Srikant 1994; Agrawal et al. 1995), and occurs also in other contexts (e.g. (Klosgen 1995; Wang et al. 1994)).
