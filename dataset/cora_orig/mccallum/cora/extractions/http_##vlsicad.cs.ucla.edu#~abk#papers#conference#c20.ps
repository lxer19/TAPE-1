Abstract: While the experimental results in Section 6 clearly show the effectiveness of the DME algorithm in the Elmore delay model, examples exist for which DME does not give an optimal ZST under the Elmore model for a given topology [2][4]. The counterexample in [2][4] refutes the claim in [3] that the DME algorithm is optimal for any given routing topology under the Elmore model. 6 Results We implemented the DME algorithm on Sun SPARC workstations in the C/UNIX environment. The code can be obtained from the authors. We used two sets of benchmarks: (i) the sink placements for the MCNC Primary1 and Primary2 benchmarks used in [5] and [6], and originally provided by the authors of [5]; and (ii) the sink placements for the five benchmarks r1 - r5 used in [8]. Our experimental results for linear delay are contained in Table 1. We applied the DME embedding algorithm to the topologies generated by the bottom-up, matching based method of Kahng, Cong and Robins (KCR) [6]. We compare our results with the original KCR results and with the Method of Means and Medians (MMM) of Jackson et al. [5]. The combined algorithm KCR+DME produced an average reduction in cost of 9% from the original KCR results and 16% from the MMM results. In the linear model, DME also produces trees with optimal source-sink delay. In our experiments, this optimal delay was on average 19% less than that of the KCR constructions. Table 2: Comparison of KCR+DME with other algorithms for the Elmore delay model. Results of Tsay's algorithm for benchmarks P1 and P2 were not available. Similar improvements were obtained for Elmore delay on the same benchmarks, as shown in Table 2. The average reduction in wirelength was 16% versus the MMM results, and 12% versus the results of Tsay. Our results also indicate a very significant reduction in source-sink delay in the Elmore model: the combination of KCR+DME reduced Elmore delay by an average of 22% compared to the results of Tsay. The Deferred-Merge Embedding (DME) algorithm offers many improvements over previous embedding schemes. DME constructs a highly flexible tree of merging segments which allows a choice among minimum-cost zero skew clock trees. Given any connection topology over the set of sink locations, DME always produces a tree with exact zero skew, and may thus be applied to previously generated clock trees in order to improve both wirelength and delay. Experiments show that applying DME to topologies generated by the algorithm of [6] results in wirelength reductions of 9% to 16% over [5] [6] [8]. Finally, under the linear delay model, DME yields optimal total wire-length for the topology and optimal source-sink delay overall. Most of the results in this paper also appear in [4], reflecting a collaboration between the present authors and the authors of [3] that arose after it was learned that the two groups had, through independent research, come up with essentially the same embedding approach. The authors are grateful to Dr. Ren-Song Tsay for providing benchmark data.
