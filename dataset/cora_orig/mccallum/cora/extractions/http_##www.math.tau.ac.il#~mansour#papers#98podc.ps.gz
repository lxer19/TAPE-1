Title: Competitive Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation  
Author: Amotz Bar-Noy Yishay Mansour Baruch Schieber 
Abstract: We propose a realistic theoretical model for dynamic bandwidth allocation. Our model takes into account the two classical quality of service parameters: latency and utilization, together with a newly introduced parameter: number of bandwidth allocation changes, which are costly operations in today's networks. Our model assumes that sessions join the network with a certain delay requirement rather than a bandwidth requirement as assumed in previous models. In addition, the network has a certain utilization requirement. Given bounds on latency and utilization, we design online algorithms that minimize the number of bandwidth allocation changes.

Reference-contexts: We give a brief review here with a special emphasis on the differences between our model and the related models. The works of <ref> [AAF + 93, AAP93] </ref> discuss the case where there are incoming sessions with a given bandwidth requirement. The system needs either to assign a path to a session with the desired bandwidth, or to reject the session.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to maximize the total throughput of the network (i.e., the bandwidth of the accepted sessions). Once a session is accepted and gets its bandwidth allocation, it remains fixed throughout the lifetime of the session. The works of <ref> [GG92, GGK + 93, BNCK + 95, ABFR94, AGLR94] </ref> also discuss the case of incoming sessions, each with a certain bandwidth requirement. The difference is that in their model sessions that were accepted may be later preempted. However, preempted sessions (like rejected sessions) do not contribute to the throughput.

Reference-contexts: the required bandwidth may change dramatically over time, usually in an unpredictable manner. (See Figure 1 for an example of a stream of bits requested by a session.) In order to accommodate such situations it is reasonable to require the network to allow dynamic modification of the bandwidth allocation. (See <ref> [GKT95, CRS95, ACHM96] </ref> for trends in applying dynamic bandwidth allocation.) 6 Bandwidth Time When considering static bandwidth allocation for tasks with varying and unpredictable bandwidth requirements, the latency and utilization parameters interplay. <p> The tradeoff between the three parameters, utilization, latency and number of changes was studied experimentally in <ref> [GKT95, ACHM96] </ref>. They compared different heuristics for allocating bandwidth, and ran simulations based on real network traffic. The number of changes was limited by either requiring that the modification be done periodically, or by other means.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to both models, the model in this work assumes that sessions join the network with a certain delay and utilization requirement (rather than a bandwidth requirement). The bandwidth required to maintain the delay and utilization requirements of the sessions is allocated dynamically. Another related model appears in <ref> [SK94, LPR94] </ref>. The system they consider has a bound on the number of sessions that can be active simultaneously. Each time the system needs to make a decision which sessions to keep active. The goal is to minimize the number of status changes, i.e., making an active session inactive.
