Reference-contexts: In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of face detection and localization using random graph matching. Graph matching has previously been used by Amit <ref> [1] </ref> for aligning X-ray images of hands; however, in his scheme the graphs are restricted to be of a special form (triangulated) in order to reduce the computational complexity; also, potential matches are scored based on an ad hoc energy function.

Reference-contexts: Given the observed data O = o, there are a number of estimators that could be used to estimate the missing data. A particularly useful choice is the conditional mean since this estimator has the minimum variance property <ref> [2] </ref>. For jointly Gaussian distributed data, the conditional mean estimator is given by ^ M (O) = E (M jO) = oo (O O) (6) Hence, given the observation O = o, we would esti mate ^ m = ^ M (o).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of face recognition has received considerable attention from the computer vision community, and a number of techniques have been proposed in the literature <ref> [3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19] </ref>. However, in most of these studies the face was in a benign environment from which it could easily be extracted, or it was assumed to have been pre-segmented.

Reference-contexts: For any of these recognition algorithms to work in a general setting, we need a system that can reliably locate faces in cluttered scenes and with occlusions. Recent studies have begun to address the problem of face localization. Burel and Carel <ref> [4] </ref> proposed a method based on multi-resolution analysis and learning from examples (multi-layer perceptron) to search for faces in an image. Yang and Huang [18] have described a system that locates faces using a hierarchical knowledge-based approach. Burt [6] has built a hardware system that works in semi-controlled environments.

International Workshop on Face and Gesture Recognition, </booktitle> <address> Zurich, Switzerland, </address> <month> June </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: Since different people have different distances between their features, the arc lengths are modeled as a random vector drawn from a joint probability distribution. (We describe an alternative approach for modeling faces in <ref> [5] </ref>). The face localization task, therefore, corresponds to the problem of random graph matching; however, the statistical structure of our graphs is exploited to yield a compu-tationally feasible algorithm. 2 Feature Detection The initial step in our face localization algorithm is to identify candidate locations for various facial features. <p> A second extension involves the representation of constellations as a vector of mutual distances. This representation causes some difficulties in transforming back to the image domain and some theoretical difficulties with the probability distributions. However, we believe we can fix these problems by using the theory of shape statistics <ref> [7, 5] </ref>. Finally, our statistical model of the random graphs currently only applies to quasi-frontal faces. We envision two ways of extending our method to full rotations in depth. The first method is to use separate models for frontal, three-quarters, and profile.

Reference-contexts: Although many methods are available for detecting features, in our experiments we have elected to use a technique based on matching descriptors produced by multi-orientation, multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters. Variations of this approach have been used successfully before, e.g., by Jones and Ma-lik <ref> [10] </ref> in their stereo matching algorithm. The incoming image is first convolved with a set of Gaussian derivative filters at different orientations and scales. The filtering is performed on a pyramid to reduce the computation time.
