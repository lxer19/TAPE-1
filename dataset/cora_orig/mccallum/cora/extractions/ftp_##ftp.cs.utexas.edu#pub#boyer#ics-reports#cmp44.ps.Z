Reference-contexts: We believe these same observations can be made about decision procedures in general. Let us quickly review our observations while considering decision procedures. Decidable theories are inadequate for the specification of most programs. The situation is improved somewhat by the work of Oppen and Nelson <ref> [13] </ref> which shows how one can construct a system of cooperating decision procedures for disjoint theories. But in our experience most theories of use to program verification are not disjoint.

Reference-contexts: Thus, our original objective was achieved. Among the theorems proved by the latest version of the theorem prover are the invertibility of the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman public key encryption algorithm [7], Wilson's theorem <ref> [14] </ref>, Gauss' law of 8 quadratic reciprocity and the Church-Rosser theorem [15]. All of these proofs involved a substantial amount of linear arithmetic reasoning. We now turn to our observation that theoretical efficiency is not a good measure of the utility of a linear procedure in a larger system.
