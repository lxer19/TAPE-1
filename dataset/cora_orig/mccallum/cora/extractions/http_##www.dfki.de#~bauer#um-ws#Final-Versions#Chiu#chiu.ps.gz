Title: Using C4.5 as an Induction Engine for Agent Modelling: An Experiment of Optimisation

Abstract: Input-Output Agent Modelling (IOAM) is an approach to modelling an agent in terms of relationships between the inputs and outputs of the cognitive system. This approach, together with one of the leading inductive learning algorithm, C4.5, has been adopted to build a C4.5-IOAM subtraction modeller, which aims to model students competencies on elementary subtraction skills. Results showed that C4.5-IOAM could achieved reasonably high predictive power for this purpose. Very little attempt has been made for optimising the current system that improvement of its performance could be achieved by employing strategies and techniques for this purpose. This paper reports an experiment that studied how the systems performance could be improved with techniques of confining training examples and resolving conflicting predictions. Results show that these strategies improve the systems performance in the aspects of capturing more student errors and achieving higher prediction rate.

Reference-contexts: By associating decision trees with estimated error rates, and consulting them in a ranked order, the system could make more predictions without dropping the prediction accuracy significantly. We have considered employing stratified tenfold cross-validation <ref> (Kohavi, 1995) </ref> for estimating the error rate of each decision tree. For each action feature, the training examples are equally divided into ten partitions. Each partition, which preserves the original class distribution, is used in turn as test data for the decision trees trained by the remaining nine partitions.

Reference-contexts: By describing the capabilities rather than capturing internal mechanisms of the cognitive system, this approach reduces the systems inter-modular complexity and allows different inductive engines to plug-in for generating different languages to describe an agent. Previous IOAM approaches include Feature Based Modelling (FBM) <ref> (Webb and Kuzmycz, 1996) </ref>, Relational Based Modelling (Kuzmycz, 1995), FFOIL-IOAM and C4.5-IOAM (Chiu et al., 1997). Among them, C4.5-IOAM uses C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), a well-known and general-purpose learning algorithm, as its induction engine to model a students competency of subtraction skills. <p> reports an experiment that studied how this objective could be achieved with the techniques of confining training examples and resolving conflicting predictions. 2 2 An overview of C4.5-IOAM In the C4.5-IOAM subtraction modeller, the ways of manipulating context and action features of the problem domain were adopted from by FBM <ref> (Webb & Kuzmycz 1996) </ref>. Context features describe the problems with which a student is faced while action features describe aspects of a students actions for a particular problem. C4.5-IOAM manipulates a n-digit subtraction problem by treating it as n separate column problems.

Reference-contexts: Although the techniques explored in this paper help the system to improve the general prediction performance, these techniques do not learn how to resolve conflicting predictions. This suggests a possible exploration on applying inductive learning in resolving conflicting predictions. Stacked generalization <ref> (Wolpert, 1992) </ref>, which is a method that learns the outputs of others inductive learners, could be one of the considerations. We will see whether this method works in future studies.
