Title: Using Motor Actions for Location Recognition

Abstract: We present a Behaviour-based mobile robot that is able to autonomously build internal representations of its environment and use these for location recognition. This is done by a process of self-organisation, no explicit world-model is given. The robot uses an artificial neural network for mapbuilding and additional adaptive processes to achieve successful location recognition. The robot reliably recognises locations in the world and can cope with the noise inherent to the real world.

Reference-contexts: In an exploratory phase bees store visual images, which are then associated with a motion vector that gives the direction towards the hive, see ([Waterman '89], [Gould & Gould '88] and <ref> [Cartwright & Collett '83] </ref>). When released some distance away from the hive, bees can find their way back using these acquired visual images by comparing them with the current images and calculating the appropriate flight direction to take them to their hive, [Collett '87].

Reference-contexts: When released some distance away from the hive, bees can find their way back using these acquired visual images by comparing them with the current images and calculating the appropriate flight direction to take them to their hive, <ref> [Collett '87] </ref>. In a similar way our robot stores "motor action images" and later compares stored images with current ones in order to recognise locations it has been at before. However, no vectors pointing homewards are associated with these images.

Reference-contexts: Similar mechanisms are found in biology. Pigeons, for example, extract the changes in air pressure generated by changes in altitude of a few feet by ignoring the total strength and only measuring differences around some mean, <ref> [Gould '82] </ref>. Using this simple device in our robot means that it does not need any predefined knowledge about thresholds and significant motor actions, it finds this out for itself. This approach has further advantages: The robot is able to adjust its assessment if the world or the robot change. <p> Other kinds of sensor-based navigation behaviour schemes have also been documented. For example, pigeons and salmon navigate using olfactory information (<ref> [Gould '82] </ref>, [Hasler, Scholz & Horral '78]), and it seems possible that pigeons also use acoustic (infrasound) and magnetic sensors to find their way home [Gould '82]. Bees and ants also use the po-larisation of the light of the sky to navigate [Wehner '76]. All these biological examples appear to just use sensor information and they are clearly reliable and robust.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the robot is able to both avoid obstacles, follow walls, and negotiate the corners of its enclosure without these being explicitly specified tasks achieved using explicitly programmed strategies. In this sense they are examples of emergent functionality as defined by <ref> [Steels '91] </ref>. In the experiment presented here both the obstacle avoidance and wall following be-haviours were preprogrammed.

All these biological examples appear to just use sensor information and they are clearly reliable and robust. However, our experiments with simple robots have shown that motor-action based schemes can be used as well in order to achieve high degrees of reliability and robustness.
