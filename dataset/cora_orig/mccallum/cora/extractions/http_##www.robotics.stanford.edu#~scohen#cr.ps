Title: Cyclic Reduction  
Author: Scott Cohen 
Date: November 10, 1994  
Abstract: The method of Block Cyclic Reduction (BCR) is described in the context of solving Poisson's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The numerical instability of the original BCR algorithm is shown. A stable variant to BCR, credited to Oscar Buneman, is described and a proof of stabilty is given. Finally, the Sweet device for parallelization is presented.

The Poisson problem (i.e., finding a function whose laplacian is equal to a given function in the interior of a region with certain boundary conditions) is not the only problem for which cyclic reduction may be applied.

Reference-contexts: It follows that A is invertible. Since the invertible matrix A is both symmetric and negative definite, any linear system Av = w may be solved numerically using Gaussian elimination without partial pivoting (cf <ref> [3] </ref>, pp. 207-208).

Reference-contexts: After solving this system, the previously eliminated unknowns are computed by backsubstitution. 4.1 The Reduction Stage of BCR Assume for simplicity that the system size n is of the form n = 2 k+1 1: (The case for general n is described by Roland Sweet in <ref> [8] </ref>.) Organize the n block equations of (5) into 5 groups of the three: u j2 + Au j1 + u j = b j1 u j + Au j+1 + u j+2 = b j+1 for each j = 2; 4; . . . ; n 3; n 1 (where <p> This is also true when Neumann or periodic boundary conditions have been specified. In this paper we dealt only with the case when the size of the coefficient matrix is of the form n = 2 k+1 1. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Roland Sweet provides extensions to the Buneman variant of BCR for equations of the form (49) with Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic boundary conditions. For each of these boundary conditions, the extended algorithm presented by Sweet reduces to the Buneman algorithm in the case n = 2 k+1 1. 22

Reference-contexts: We want to compute v = (A (r) ) 1 w: We know that A (r) is a polynomial of degree 2 r in A and that it is factored as in (20). The brilliant idea of Roland Sweet in <ref> [9] </ref> to obtain parallelism is to use the partial fraction expansion of (A (r) ) 1 . We need the following lemma from complex analysis: Lemma 5 Let p (x) and q (x) be relatively prime polynomials with deg q &lt; deg p = n.
