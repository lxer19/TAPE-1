Abstract: We present a design for an optical free-space, crossbar-like interconnection network. Based on a 1 to N routing switch, we give the details of a possible setup utilizing 3-D space. One switch is associated with each processing element (PE), and the routing is done in a distributed manner by being incorporated in the action of transmission. The light is thereafter directed by multifaceted holograms. Parallel algorithms with communication locality can benefit from the uniform distribution of PSs in space, by minimizing the time latency of their communications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Designing a large parallel interconnection network is one of the important problems awaiting good solutions <ref> [9] </ref>. It is generally felt that optics hold much promise in this respect. There are several proposals to build an interconnection network capable of connecting a large number of processing elements (PEs), to create a parallel computing system (for examples see [4, 5, 7, 8, 11]). <p> Many attempts 10 where made to realize such devices, but at the present state of technology it will be hard to design a moderately large crossbar switch <ref> [9] </ref>. Although the chosen topology (a crossbar interconnection) for the parallel network could be useful in many applications, some of the requirements placed on the network are too demanding not just for the present state of technology, but perhaps for a long time to come.

Reference-contexts: In a practical system, we also have to deal with the problem of beam divergence. Therefore we use a focusing system, to maintain the beams cross-section dimensions in the limits of the facets dimensions. We use the holographic telescope principle <ref> [10] </ref> to reduce the cross section of the beam, as shown in figure 12 (B) and (C). boards and the way the beams propagate between and in them. It can be seen that the topology separates the "input" and the "output" sides of the board. <p> The information entering the PE is directed by a holographic facet on the board just under it. The height of the board is used to accommodate these elements. The focusing holograms are inside the board, and might be produced in place, as suggested by <ref> [10] </ref>. Other elements 16 should be fitted in as described next, depending on the position of a particular board in the cube structure. 5.2 The General Unity Theorem In this section we look into the question of the amount of similarity between different boards in the cube.

Enough space is left to provide access for maintenance work to every board in the cube. 4 3.1 The Switch The basic routing element in the network is the "DynaSwitch" <ref> [12] </ref>. This switch uses a dynamic hologram written in a photorefractive crystal to deflect (and split) a beam of light towards a set of destinations, thus implementing a multicast. 1 The routing data information is supplied locally by the PE associated with every switch. <p> Basic building blocks The routing is done using a combination of a dynamic routing element and a static (passive) routing network. The dynamic routing element is the "Dy-naSwitch" <ref> [12] </ref>. As described in section 3.1, we use a 2-D beam deflector element. This element steers the beam to any point (facet) on a plain and can, optionally, split the beam so as to allow multicast communication. The details of the switch design are presented in a separate paper [12]. <p> "Dy-naSwitch" <ref> [12] </ref>. As described in section 3.1, we use a 2-D beam deflector element.

Figure 10 presents the basic routing functions that these facets implement. As will be explained in the following section, we choose to use only certain types of holographic routing functions. 13 an "interconnection cache".
