Abstract: We report on our efforts to develop a sequential robot controller composition technique in the context of dexterous "batting" maneuvers. A robot with a flat paddle is required to strike repeatedly at a thrown ball until the ball is brought to rest on the paddle at a specified location. The robot's reachable workspace is blocked by an obstacle that disconnects the freespace formed when the ball and paddle remain in contact, forcing the machine to "let go" for a time in order to bring the ball to the desired state. The controller compositions that we create guarantee that a ball introduced in the "safe workspace" remains there and is ultimately brought to the goal. We report on experimental results from an implementation of these formal composition methods, and present descriptive statistics characterizing the experiments.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we further our work by showing how to compose controllers in such a manner as to avoid an obstacle that disconnects the workspace. In previous work <ref> [4, 22] </ref>, we have paid a great deal of attention to the lower level palette of controllers. Our architecture implements event-driven robot policies whose resulting closed loop dynamics drive the coupled robot-environment state toward a goal set. <p> Note that the intermittent contacts characteristic of juggling promote a view of this closed loop from the perspective of a return map on a Poincare section <ref> [4] </ref>, thus f is a map rather than a vector field, as illustrated in Figure 7 (b). We are interested in encoding and achieving user goals taking the form of a desired set of world states, G B. <p> a robot strategy that causes the paddle to respond to the motions of the ball in four ways: (i) r = b causes the paddle to track under the ball at all times. (ii) r "mirrors" the vertical motion of the ball as expressed by the original planar mirror law <ref> [4] </ref>. (iii) Radial motion of the ball causes the paddle to raise and lower, resulting in the normal being adjusted to correct for radial deviation in the ball position. 10 (iv) Angular motion of the ball causes the paddle to roll, again adjusting the normal so as to correct for lateral <p> In previous work, Rizzi et. al. [22] have shown that the vertical and horizontal subsystems of f J are essentially decoupled. This allows us to examine the two systems independently and combine the results. Buehler et. al. <ref> [4] </ref> showed that the restriction of f J to V has global attraction to G V . Currently, however, we can only show local attraction for the horizontal system.

Instead, we turn to another tradition introduced within the fine motion planning literature roughly one decade ago by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor <ref> [15] </ref> | the notion of preimage back-chaining. Assume the availability of a palette of controllers whose induced funnels have targets that can be placed at will. <p> Currently, catching is the dominant source of task failures, as we report in Section 4. 3 Formal Idea: Safe Sequential Composition The technique proposed here is a variant of the preimage backchaining idea introduced by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor <ref> [15] </ref>, although their algorithm was used for compliant motion in the face of velocity uncertainty with respect to a generalized damper model of dynamics.

As will be seen in the sequel, this would be very helpful to our methods, but the absence of closed form expressions does not impede the ideas introduced in Section 1.3.
