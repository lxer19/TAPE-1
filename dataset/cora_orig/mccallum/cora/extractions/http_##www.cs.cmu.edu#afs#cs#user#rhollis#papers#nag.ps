Abstract: In the past few years there has been a great deal of discussion about the feasibility and desirability of developing microminiature robots which could be deployed en masse to do useful tasks. We attempt to examine some of the important issues involved in such a would-be endeavor, including matters of scale and controllability. In this Keynote Lecture, I present several examples from the research community that illustrate these themes, including work from our own laboratory on miniature modular robots for precision (micron level) assembly and high-fidelity haptic interface devices based on Lorentz magnetic levitation.

Interesting developments include folded hinge structures <ref> [12] </ref> offering greater design flexibilities. 3 Smallish Robots Doing Tiny Jobs We concern ourselves here with micro-motion robots. In recent years, it has been shown that quite macroscopic-sized machines are capable of exceedingly small (nm and below) motions even in the presence of thermal noise and external vibration.

Reference-contexts: A direct-drive electromagnetic three degree-of-freedom fine positioner was developed which exhibited large payload capacity, 200 nm (3) motion resolution, and 50 Hz position band width <ref> [13] </ref>. This performance was two orders of magnitude improvement over the robot arm alone, enabling several kinds of precision electronic assembly. Probably the best examples of micro-motion robots, however, are the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and its many cousins, including the atomic force microscope (AFM).

Reference-contexts: It was demonstrated In 1990 that atomic-scale landscapes could be explored and felt with the hand in real time by interfacing a haptic feedback device with an STM <ref> [16] </ref>. Figure 3 illustrates this concept: the hand holds a sharp probe which is moved manually over a surface; as the probe is moved laterally by the person, it moves vertically in relation to atomic-scale features.

More recently, workers at University of North Carolina have succeeded in feeling individual atoms and in manipulating virus particles <ref> [17] </ref>. In any such scaled telemanipulation system, there is a part that deals with the micro world, and a part that deals with the macro world, e.g. a user's hand.

Reference-contexts: In the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory at 2 Carnegie Mellon University, we are developing high-performance six-degree-of-freedom haptic interface devices based on Lorentz magnetic levitation <ref> [18] </ref>. Primarily intended for interaction with virtual environments, it is hoped this new device will also be appropriate as a telemanipulation "master," especially in scaled systems, because of its design which uses a single, frictionless moving part with "direct drive" high resolution (3 m), high frequency (~90 Hz) response characteristics.

Reference-contexts: size more appropriate to its mission?" We are developing an "Architecture for Agile Assembly" (AAA) with goals of drastically reducing factory design, deployment, and programming times; increasing alignment precision from today's 50-100 m to around 1 m anywhere within the factory; and reducing factory size by a factor of 10 <ref> [19] </ref>. To support this framework we are creating families of small, precision two-degree-of-freedom robots that will comprise key elements of miniature factories, or "minifactories" [20].

Reference-contexts: To support this framework we are creating families of small, precision two-degree-of-freedom robots that will comprise key elements of miniature factories, or "minifactories" <ref> [20] </ref>. One type is based on closed-loop planar linear motor "courier" robots that carry subassemblies through the mini-factory; another type is a "manipulator/feeder" vertical/rotary motion robot that places parts on the subassemblies. These two types of robots interact cooperatively to form transient four-degree-of-freedom robots emulating the actions of conventional SCARAs.
