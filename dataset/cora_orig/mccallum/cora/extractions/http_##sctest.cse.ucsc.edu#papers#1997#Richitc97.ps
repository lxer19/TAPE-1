Abstract: In addition to automatically generating correct wiring, routers are used to meet additional design goals. Examples include reducing capacitive coupling and improving yield. Using routers to improve testability has been mentioned in the literature, but concrete rules or methods have not been explained or implemented. In this paper, we show how a modified router improves bridge fault testability for two different test metrics, static-voltage testing and pseudo-exhaustive segmentation testing, with no significant increase in area or time. This method is flexible in that further testability improvements are possible by trading off area or routing time.

Reference-contexts: likelihood of shorts, and increasing the testability of shorts that do occur, by making the outputs of multi-input gates be adjacent to as few other lines as possible, keeping signals in different pseudo-exhaustive testing segments from being adjacent, and giving preference to routing layers that are less susceptible to shorts <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> One technique to take advantage of exhaustive testing without requiring as many tests is to divide a circuit into segments that each have fewer inputs and to then exhaustively test each segment [34-39]. This is referred to as psuedo-exhaustive testing. As was mentioned by Acken <ref> [16] </ref>, detectable BFs may go undetected by a psuedo-exhaustive test set if the BF occurs between lines that do not have a segment in common. <p> However, because so many BFs occur between wires in different segments, this translates to a significant improvement in overall testability. For further improvements, segmentation should be considered during circuit placement <ref> [16] </ref>. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we presented the first implementation of P-DFT techniques that improves the testability of circuits during routing. The MCR router was modified and achieved significant improvements in testability with insignificant area overhead and acceptable performance overhead.

Reference-contexts: testability and shows that the testability of sample layouts of the ISCAS 85 circuits was improved by applying these ideas to an existing router. 2 Problem Statement During the fabrication of an integrated circuit, errors may occur that cause two signal wires to be shorted together creating a bridging fault <ref> [21] </ref>. A bridging fault (BF) is defined by the two nodes involved in an electrical short.

Reference-contexts: A BF may occur due to different defect types and the probability of a BF occurring is the sum of the critical areas for each defect type times the defect density for each defect type <ref> [22] </ref>. For this paper, we consider only non-feedback BFs and only BFs in the routing area. We divide BFs into two disjoint sets: those that we try to reduce the 1 Note that critical area is a function of the distribution of defect radii. <p> We divide BFs into two disjoint sets: those that we try to reduce the 1 Note that critical area is a function of the distribution of defect radii. This is explained in more detail in <ref> [22] </ref>. 1 probability of occurring are called Targeted (T) BFs, and those that we don't try to prevent are called Non-Targeted (NT) BFs. The set of BFs in T-BF depends on which BFs are considered difficult to test. <p> In addition, Tim-berWolf was started with a different seed for each placement. To determine the probability of a T-BF occurring after routing, Carafe <ref> [22] </ref>, an inductive fault analysis tool, was used to extract the set of likely BFs from the cell interconnect and their relative likelihood based on the critical area of the BF.

Reference-contexts: Like previous work, we felt that the best way to do this was to separate or shield wires that could cause T-BFs. The implementation details were partially presented in <ref> [23, 24] </ref> and fully discussed in [25]. In this paper we will avoid details concerning the router whenever possible to simplify the discussion. <p> Because of this, we studied the characteristics of undetectable BFs to see if a significant number could be identified with little computational effort. In our study <ref> [23] </ref>, we found that many undetectable BFs can be identified by considering only local information, circuit information that is close to the fault site. We call these Locally Determined Undetectable Bridge Faults (LDU-BFs). <p> A non-propagatable LDU-BF is identified by the bridged lines being inputs to a single gate that performs the same logic function as the short 2 . We found that the LDU-BFs comprised close to 42% of all undetectable BFs <ref> [23] </ref>. The locality characteristic of LDU-BFs allows a router to identify a significant number of T-BFs with little computational effort. By considering more levels of the circuit, more T-BFs can be identified at a greater cost. An example of this tradeoff is Isern and Figueras' tunable multi-level redundancy identification [33].

Reference-contexts: To test some of these ideas, we modified a channel router, MCR <ref> [26] </ref>, to improve testability. MCR is an improved version of Uzi Yoeli's robust channel routing algorithm [27], which is in turn based on YACR2 [28].

Reference-contexts: In this case some of the T-BFs are potentially not detected by the pseudo-exhaustive tests. 4.1 Experimental Procedure To determine the effectiveness of modifying MCR to separate selected wire pairs, ten different placements of each of the 5 largest ISCAS combinational test circuits <ref> [29] </ref> were routed with and without the testability modifications. The placements were generated by TimberWolf [30] using MCNC's Oasis cell library.

Reference-contexts: The placements were generated by TimberWolf <ref> [30] </ref> using MCNC's Oasis cell library. In order to make the placements differ as much as 2 possible, each circuit input and circuit output was randomly assigned to one of the four sides of the layout for each different placement.

Reference-contexts: In this subsection, a BF is a T-BF if no static voltage test can be found by our ATPG system that distinguishes the faulty and defect-free circuits. The Nemesis <ref> [31] </ref> ATPG system generated tests for all the BFs with critical area for each layout (stuck-at tests were not used). 4.3.1 Results A direct approach to eliminating the T-BFs is to generate a routed circuit, extract the set of possible BFs from the circuit, perform ATPG to find the set of

Reference-contexts: The ratio of T-BFs to BFs is higher than in the previous subsection resulting in a smaller reduction in T-BF critical area, as Figure 4 predicts. 4.4.1 Experimental Procedure Jon Udell's segmentation software <ref> [39] </ref> was used to create reasonable segments for each of the ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits. MCR was then modified to try to separate lines if they have no segment in common. To do this, the generated segments were used to create a list of the segments each wire belonged to.
