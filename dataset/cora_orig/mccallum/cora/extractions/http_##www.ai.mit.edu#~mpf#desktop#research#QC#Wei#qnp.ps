Abstract: Tailoring many-body interactions among a proper quantum system endows it with computing ability by means of static quantum computation in the sense that some of the physical degrees of freedom can be used to store binary information and the corresponding binary variables satisfy some given logic relations if and only if the system is in the ground state. Constructing a static quantum computing machine is within the reach of today's or the foreseeable future's technology. Such a machine works in the static manner so that dissipation does it no harm but helps. A general computational task is accomplished in two steps. The first is to evaluate logic functions by the static quantum network and encode the solutions into the ground state of the system. It is done upon the computer being constructed and the input being set. For this step the new concept of static computational complexity (SCC) in terms of the number of logic gates should be introduced instead of the usual time complexity. Two theorems on SCC are proved showing that the universal static quantum computer can encode the solutions for any P and NP problem into its ground state using only polynomial number (in the problem input size) of logic gates. The second step is to read out the solutions by relaxing the system. For this step the time complexity makes sense. The relaxation time is proved at most polynomially long as the size of the computing system increases. The overall conclusion is that on a universal static quantum computer all P and NP problems can be solved efficiently in the

Reference-contexts: All the dynamic computers have difficulties in solving search problems, particularly the NP problems [4,5]. In a recent work [6], it has been described how to construct a quantum search machine to solve the 3-SATISFIABILITY problem which is a famous hard search problem in computer science <ref> [4] </ref>. The search machine accomplishes its task of encoding the solution for a given problem into its ground state by no dynamic evolution but the so-called static quantum computation (see the definition below). If the machine relaxes to the ground state quickly, the solution can be read out fast. <p> The EDCSQN evaluates a given function for all the 2 n inputs in parallel and all the results are stored in the output binary wires. This gives birth to the notion of static quantum parallelism. By virtue of this parallelism, an EDCSQN accomplishes nondeterministic computation <ref> [4] </ref> in the static manner. Static Computational Complexity Definition 7 The static computational complexity of an SQC or SQN is the number of basic static logic elements that it consists of. <p> The basic static logic elements are the binary wire register, the logic inverter, the AND and the OR gate. 5 As in the theory of computational complexity based on the Turing machine <ref> [4] </ref>, problems can be classified according to the static computational complexity. Definition 8 A problem is in the class SP if its static computational complexity function SCC (n) is bounded by a polynomial P, i.e. <p> Definition 8 A problem is in the class SP if its static computational complexity function SCC (n) is bounded by a polynomial P, i.e. SCC (n) P (n) (2) Notice that unlike the definition of the well-known class P on Turing machine <ref> [4] </ref>, problems in the class SP are not restricted to be deterministic. <p> classical definition, a problem in class P with input size n can be solved in p (n) steps of computation on a deterministic one-tape Turing machine (DTM), which consists of a finite state control, a read-write head, and a tape made up of a two-way infinite sequence of tape squares <ref> [4] </ref>. A program runs on the DTM in a step-by-step manner. <p> By definition, an NP decision problem is a search problem whose answer can be checked in polynomial time on a classical DTM <ref> [4] </ref>. In general, the check consists of a few YES/NO questions. According to Theorem 1, this check task can be accomplished by an EDC SQDTM consisting of polynomial number of basic static logic elements which is part of the USQC as shown in Fig.3. <p> These levels are highly degenerate. To see why this is true, notice that any NP problem can be poly- nomially transformed into a 3SAT problem <ref> [4] </ref>, and for 3SAT problem with the input size n there are at most q (n) &lt; C 3 n &lt; n 3 three-clauses, when one encodes this 3SAT problem onto a USQC and associates each clause with a DEDLU which gives an interaction energy value of either 0 or , <p> Conclusions On a universal static quantum computer, all P and NP <ref> [4] </ref> problems can be efficiently solved in the sense that the number of logic gates, the precision in energy tailoring, and the read-out time required are all bounded by polynomial functions of the problem input size. Static quantum computers have the built-in ability in simulating other many-body physical systems. <p> This has the great advantage in simulating dissipative systems. Wide applications of static quantum computation should be expected in most areas of science and engineering, such as combinatorial mathematics, computational physics, and economic optimization. To mention but a few hard computational problems: the satisfiability decision problem <ref> [4] </ref>, the classic example of traveling-salesman optimization problem [4], search for the global minimum energy state of a spin glass system [14], predicting the conformational ground state [24] and the folding [25] of proteins which are essential to understand physical processes involved in life phenomena, exploration of the potential energy surface <p> Wide applications of static quantum computation should be expected in most areas of science and engineering, such as combinatorial mathematics, computational physics, and economic optimization.

Reference-contexts: Those states whose variables fail to satisfy Eq.1 are associated with higher energies. Any quantum system that evaluates logic functions via static quantum computation is regarded as a static quantum computer (SQC). The idea of static quantum computation has been implicitly used to make simple logic gates <ref> [7] </ref>, yet the possibility to construct a static quantum computer 3 and achieve the great computational power have not been realized. The above definition of SQC is general. <p> No dynamic evolution is needed. The right answers together with the corresponding inputs are encoded into the ground state. For this reason when the idea of static computation was used to achieve simple logic operations, it has been called "computing with the ground state" <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By virtue of its spatial extension, a binary wire can also serve as information transmission line. By definition, any linear chain of strongly interacting atomic bodies is a potential candidate for the binary wire. Examples are linear ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic chains, lines of Coulomb interacting quantum dots <ref> [8] </ref>, linear arrays of interacting superconductors, ect. Although the binary wire proposed in Ref.[8] is by no means the only possible implementation, it is conceptually instructive and almost realizable by today's technology.

Reference-contexts: Hence the dedicated AND gate is non-EDC in the sense that when connected to an SQN it won't conserve the energy degeneracy. Fortunately, all non-EDC SQLG can be made EDC by an input symmetrization technique. Since any logic gate can be decomposed into two-level AND gates and inverters <ref> [9] </ref>, it is sufficient to show that the two-level AND gate can be made EDC. There are only four possible inputs for an AND gate with two input binary wires. A single AND gate may contribute at most four different values of interaction energy.

Reference-contexts: The SQDTM has been constructed as some kind of static quantum automata (SQA) <ref> [10] </ref> which "runs" the DTM program in the static manner and outputs the results by the last binary wires when in ground state. It is taken for granted that the SFSC can be realized by a finite number (say M ) of basic static logic elements.

Reference-contexts: The reason is, as mentioned before, that nature relaxes a real system in a parallel and irreversible manner, by virtue of the quantum parallelism and irreversibility of energy dissipation. A spin glass system relaxes slow <ref> [14] </ref> because the interactions between spins with other systems (especially vacuum field) are extremely weak. Even a single spin at excited state won't lose its energy for an exceedingly long time. <p> To mention but a few hard computational problems: the satisfiability decision problem [4], the classic example of traveling-salesman optimization problem [4], search for the global minimum energy state of a spin glass system <ref> [14] </ref>, predicting the conformational ground state [24] and the folding [25] of proteins which are essential to understand physical processes involved in life phenomena, exploration of the potential energy surface of clusters in order to understand their structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics [26].

Reference-contexts: After waiting for a certain time, on the oder of 1 tot , one measures the system. With almost 100 percent probability, the system will be found on a lower level. By virtue of the wavefunction reduction <ref> [21] </ref>, the measurement will again eliminate any possible superposition, catch the system at an eigenstate with energy lower than E l . If this is the ground state, fine. Otherwise one waits for a certain time and measures again, the system will go to lower levels further.

Conclusions On a universal static quantum computer, all P and NP [4] problems can be efficiently solved in the sense that the number of logic gates, the precision in energy tailoring, and the read-out time required are all bounded by polynomial functions of the problem input size.
