Abstract: We are exploring the use of virtual reality for training people how to perform tasks, such as operating and maintaining complex equipment. This video describes Steve, an agent we are developing that assists in the training. Steve is an autonomous, animated agent that cohabits the virtual world with students. Steve continuously monitors the state of the virtual world, periodically manipulating it through virtual motor actions. His objective is to help students learn to perform physical, procedural tasks. He can demonstrate tasks, explaining his actions, as well as monitor students performing tasks, providing help when they need it. In addition to teaching students individual tasks, he can also help them learn to perform multi-person team tasks: he can serve as a tutor for a student learning a particular role in the team, and he can play the role of a teammate when a human teammate is unavailable. By integrating previous work in agent architectures, intelligent tutoring systems, and computer graphics, Steve illustrates a new breed of computer tutor: a human-like agent that can interact with students in a virtual world to help them learn.

Reference-contexts: However, he is not limited to this domain; he can provide instruction in a new domain given only the appropriate declarative domain knowledge. We have a variety of plans for future work. As an alternative to manual entry of domain knowledge, we are extending Steve to learn from demonstrations <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. To increase Steve's ability to motivate students, we are extending him to include emotions [2]. To allow him to express emotions, and to extend his range of nonverbal communication, we are giving him control over his facial expressions.

Finally, Steve is under ongoing informal evaluation, both within our group and by external colleagues (e.g., the Air Force Armstrong Laboratory), and we are planning formal evaluations later this year. 5 Conclusion Steve illustrates the enormous potential in combining work in agent architectures, intelligent tutoring, and graphics.

Reference-contexts: All these capabilities are illustrated in the second video clip. 2 Steve's Architecture Like many other autonomous agents that deal with a real or simulated world, Steve consists of two components: the first, implemented in Soar <ref> [5] </ref>, handles high-level cognitive processing, and the second handles sensorimotor process 1 ing. The cognitive component interprets the state of the virtual world, carries out plans to achieve goals, and makes decisions about what actions to take.
