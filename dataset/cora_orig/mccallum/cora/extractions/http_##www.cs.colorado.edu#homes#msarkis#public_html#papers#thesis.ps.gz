Reference-contexts: For this reason, mixed methods have been introduced in order to approximate Aru and u, simultaneously. We note that our motivation for considering the nonconforming P 1 space in chapter 5 comes primarily from the fact that there is an equivalence between mixed methods and nonconforming methods <ref> [2] </ref>. In this section, we present all the theoretical steps which establish this equivalence, and note that the analysis is done locally, element-by-element. <p> In the three-dimensional case, the theory is still incomplete; the difficulty is how to find a decomposition as in Assumption i) of Theorem 2.1 with v and the v i belonging to the divergence free space. iv) The method that we adopt in this thesis is based on the Arnold-Brezzi <ref> [2] </ref> theory and on our preconditioners for nonconforming P 1 finite elements problems [76, 77]; see also Chapter 5 of this thesis. <p> This observation motivated Arnold and Brezzi <ref> [2] </ref> to obtain, from u h and h , an asymptoticaly more accurate approximation of the original field u. Furthermore, the variables u h and h can be treated as one variable.

Reference-contexts: Elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients have solutions with singular behavior. Therefore, in Section 4.8, we consider nonuniform refinements. We begin with a coarse triangulation that is shape regular and possibly nonuniform and then refine it using a local refinement scheme analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [3] </ref>. We establish a condition number estimate for the iteration operator which is bounded from above by C (1 + `) 2 . For quasi-monotone coefficients, we obtain an optimal multilevel precondi-tioner. <p> We note, in particular, that solutions of elliptic problems with highly discontinuous coefficients are very likely to become increasingly singular when we approach the wire basket. Nested local refinements have previously been analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [3] </ref>, Bramble and Pasciak [5], Cheng [25, 26], Oswald [66, 67], and Yserentant [92, 93]. By nested local refinement we mean that an element, which is not refined at level j, cannot be a candidate for further refinement. <p> We note that Assumption 4.1 guarantees that all elements in T ` fl ( i ) with a common vertex are of comparable size. This type of refinement is exactly the same as that analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [3] </ref>. Let V k fl be the space of piecewise linear functions associated with the triangulation T k fl , which are continuous on and vanish on @. By construction, V k 0 V k+1 fl V k+1 0 . <p> For the local problems with constant coefficients, we use the decomposition given in Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [3] </ref>. Note that our refinement is a particular case of the local refinement NLR2 considered by Oswald [67]; we can then apply Theorem 6 of Oswald [67] to obtain a good decomposition. <p> The proof is very similar to that of Theorem 4.6 using now Lemmas 4.12-4.16. We note that Lemma 4.9, for k = 0, holds for a locally quasi-uniform triangulation T 0 fl . We now replace the decomposition (4.43) by a decomposition analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [3] </ref>, or Oswald [67]. We note that Assumption 4.1 is needed to prove the first inequality in (4.44). 2 4.9 Multilevel methods on the interface In this section, we extend our results to multilevel iterative substructuring algorithms for problems with discontinuous coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The multiplicative Schwarz algorithm is a straightforwardly extension of the classical alternating Schwarz algorithm to N subdomains once has been an order selected for the subproblems. We note, however, that the extension of the theory originally provided some difficulties; see Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu <ref> [7] </ref>, Cai and Widlund [19], Dryja and Widlund [41], and Xu [91]. If a large number subdomains is used then the convergence rates of this method will typically deteriorate rapidly with the number of subdomains. <p> Theorem 4.12 Let T NNmult be defined by (4.61). Then for any u 2 V h 0 (), we have (1 + `) 2 a (u; u) a (T NNmult u; u) a (u; u): Proof. By using the theory developed by Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu <ref> [7] </ref>, Dryja, and Widlund [41], and Zhang [95], we have (2 ^w) ` X X P k T m : (4.62) Here, ^w = max (1; w) = 1 for the Gauss Seidel case, and ^w = max (1; w) &lt; 2 for the damped Jacobi case; see Widlund [41].

Reference-contexts: The multiplicative methods are variants of the multigrid V-cycle method. In our design and analysis, we use a general Schwarz method framework developed in Chapter 2. Among the particular cases, discussed here, are the BPX algorithm, cf. Bramble, Pasciak and Xu <ref> [8] </ref>, and Xu [91], and the multilevel Schwarz method with one-dimensional subspaces considered by Zhang [94, 95]; see also Dryja and Widlund [39, 40]. It is well known that these 48 methods are optimal when the coefficients are regular. The problems become quite challenging for problems with highly discontinuous coefficients.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4.5, we study in detail the weighted L 2 projection with weights given by the discontinuous coefficients of the elliptic problem. Bramble and Xu <ref> [9] </ref>, and Xu [90] have considered this problem and established that the weighted L 2 projection is not always stable in the presence of interior cross points. <p> E l j 2 X h (u h We next use a Sobolev type inequality to obtain i p2E l;h E l u (x p )) 2 i (1 + log H=h)juj 2 Results very similar to (4.30) can be found in Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [6], Bramble and Xu <ref> [9] </ref>, Dryja [32], Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], and Dryja and Widlund [41]. <p> We obtain (4.40) from (4.37), since Q k gives the best approximation with respect to L 2 (). Finally, we note that (4.41) follows from (4.40); see Theorem 3.4 in Bramble and Xu <ref> [9] </ref>. Remark 4.6 The Lemma 4.9 and Corollary 4.2 can easily be extended to functions which do not vanish on the whole boundary @.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 5 is an extension of a technical report Two-Level Schwarz Methods for Nonconforming Finite Elements and Discontinuous Coefficients which was completed in March 1993 [76]. This work was inspired by earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner <ref> [13] </ref>, Oswald [65], as well as by recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], but a number of additional technical difficulties had to be overcome. They are primarily related to our efforts to treat quite general coefficients. <p> The construction of this component is the most interesting part of our work; we introduced nonstandard coarses spaces for problems with discontinuous coefficients. Here we have been able to draw on earlier multilevel studies, cf.

Reference-contexts: This is in contrast to an AS in which all subproblems, including T 0 , can be solved in parallel. In a MS, there is, therefore, a potential bottleneck with many processor idly waiting for the solution of the coarse problem. Motivated by this, Cai <ref> [18] </ref> introduced a hybrid Schwarz preconditioner given by T cai = flT 0 + I (I T J ) (I T 0 ) for which combines advantages of the AS and MS. Here, fl &gt; 0 is a balancing parameter.

We note, however, that we cannot guarantee that the rate of convergence of these methods are insensitive to large variations in the coefficients of 122 the differential equation; see also [68], [89], <ref> [29] </ref>, and [52].

Reference-contexts: This work was inspired by earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner [13], Oswald [65], as well as by recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>, but a number of additional technical difficulties had to be overcome. They are primarily related to our efforts to treat quite general coefficients. <p> Brenner [10]), and for non-nested meshes (cf. Cai [17, 16], Chan, Smith, and Zou [24]). We also note the face based coarse spaces, which were introduced in [76], have also been discussed in the conforming case in the recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>. We also introduce approximate harmonic extensions, and fi-Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces (generalizations of the Neumann-Neumann coarses space introduced by Dryja and Widlund [41], and Mandel and Brezina [55]).

The proof of (4.34) is a direct consequence of Schwarz inequality. The proof of (4.35) is related to the proof of (4.30). To get the seminorm bound in (4.32), we use the same arguments as for (4.31). <p> also use Lemma 4.8 For u 2 V h 0 () 1 (I W h u) (1 + log H=h) 2 a (u; u) (1 + `) 2 a (u; u): The proof of this result can be found in the proof of Theorem 6.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>.

Assumption ii). We have ! 1; see Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35]. Assumption iii). <p> However, we can define new exotic coarse spaces, denoted by V 1 , with ~ X = ~ F ; ~ E; g N N; and ~ W by introducing approximate discrete harmonic 74 extensions. They are given by simple explicit formulas <ref> [35, 76] </ref> and have the same H 1 stability estimates as the discrete harmonic extensions. Here we use strongly the fact that our exotic spaces V ~ X 1 have constant values at the nodal points of the faces of the substructures. <p> p p q q q q A A A V k C k F ig: 4:3 E k2 To approximate the discrete harmonic function F ij in i , we use the finite element function # F ij introduced in the proof of Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref> (see also Extension 3 in Sarkis [76]), given by (see Fig. 4.3). <p> Note that # F ij 2 V h 0 , and F ij @ i We remark that other extensions are also possible; see, e.g., Extension 2 of [76].

Such refinements can be used to improve the accuracy of the solutions of problems with singular 79 behavior which arise in elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients, nonconvex do-mains, or singular data. <p> For the proof of the first inequality, we use Assumption 4.1 and the inverse inequality. For the second inequality, we use that V ` fl ( i ) V ` ( i ) and then apply a standard Sobolev type inequality (see Lemma 4.3 of <ref> [35] </ref>). <p> Proof. The first inequality is trivial since the discrete harmonic function has minimal energy. For the second inequality, we use the same ideas as in Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>. Assumption 4.1 is crucial in this proof. 2 We denote by V ` fl (@ i ) the restriction of V ` fl ( i ) to @ i . <p> Using the same ideas as in Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>, we obtain Lemma 4.15 Let u 2 V ` fl ( i ). <p> Here we have been able to draw on earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner [13], Oswald [68], as well as on recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>, and Dryja and Widlund [41]. We show that the condition number of the corresponding iterative methods is bounded by C (1 + log (H=h)), where H and h are the mesh sizes of the global and local problems, respectively. <p> To prove (5.43), we use the same ideas as in the proof of Lemma 4.3 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>; we note i convex is used. 2 Remark 5.2 It is easy to see that we do not need to use the fact that u H 2 V H (); we only need to calculate the values u E ij = u H (P ij ) by formula (5.22). <p> Finally, perform a nonconforming P 1 harmonic or approximate harmonic extension. We describe the three dimensional version of Extension 5.1. This is a generalization of the partition of unity introduced by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>. Let C j , j = 1; ; 4, be the barycenters of the faces F j of @ i , and let V j be the vertex of i that is opposite to C j . <p> This gives an element of a partition of the unity introduced by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref> and the energy seminorm of u H is of order H. Let # CR H u H ( i ). <p> Integrating jr# CR F i1 (x)j 2 over this region, we find that is bounded by C (1 + log (H=h)) H. See Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [35] </ref> for more details. The arguments can be extended easily for the nonconforming P 1 case. To prove Lemma 5.7 for a general u H 2 ~ V H ( i ), we use the same ideas as for two dimensions. <p> h H 1 ( i ) h 2 (1 + log H=h) kuk 2 h ( i ) Here we have used Lemma 5.9 and a bound on the trace of conforming piecewise linear functions. 2 The following lemma is the nonconforming version of Lemma 4.5 in Dryja, Smith, Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>. 125 Lemma 5.11 For u 2 ~ V h (), we have jI h F ij u)j 2 h ( i ) (1 + log H=h) 2 kuk 2 h ( i ) ; i = 1; ; N: Here, I h CR is the standard interpolation operator into the <p> The idea of the proof is the same as for the conforming case; see Dryja, Smith, Widlund <ref> [35] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The convergence of the sequence fu k g was first established by Schwarz using maximum principle techniques. 2.3 A variational formulation We also can interpret the alternating Schwarz algorithm in a variational framework; see e.g. Dryja and Widlund <ref> [36] </ref>, Matsokin and Nepomnyaschikh [59], Nepomnyaschikh [61], and Lions [53]. <p> To remove completely the inherent sequential behavior of the T ms , Dryja and Wid-lund <ref> [36] </ref>, and Matsokin and Nepomnyaschikh [59] introduced the additive Schwarz methods. <p> We first consider a variant of a two-level additive Schwarz method introduced in 1987 by Dryja and Widlund <ref> [36] </ref> for a conforming case. In this method, a preconditioner is constructed from the restriction of the given elliptic problem to overlapping subregions into which the given region has been decomposed. In addition, in order to enhance the convergence rate, the preconditioner includes a coarse problem with lower dimension.

It is also focused on making the performance of the algorithms independent of the jumps in the coefficients. <p> We note, however, that the extension of the theory originally provided some difficulties; see Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu [7], Cai and Widlund [19], Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, and Xu [91].

One of our main results is that the condition number of the resulting systems can be estimated from above by C (1 + `) 2 with C independent of the jumps of coefficients, of the number of substructures, and also of `; see Section 4.4. <p> We first consider certain multilevel methods based on the MDS-multilevel diag onal scaling introduced by Zhang [95], enriched with a coarse space as in Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], or Sarkis [76, 77]. Let N k and N k 0 be the set of nodes associated with the space V k and V k 0 , respectively. <p> We now proceed to discuss several alternative coarse spaces and to establish bounds for the condition numbers of the corresponding additive multilevel methods. 4.4.1 Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces We first consider the Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces which have been analyzed in Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, Mandel and Brezina [55], and Sarkis [76]. An interesting feature of these coarse spaces is that they are of minimal dimension with only one degree of freedom per substructure, even in the case when the substructures are not simplices. <p> We note the coarse spaces defined with fi = 1=2, fi = 1, and fi 1=2 have been used by Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, Mandel and Brezina [55], and Sarkis [76], respectively. 54 Recently, Wang and Xie [85] introduced another coarse space which is similar to ours with fi = 1. However, their basis functions only take the value 0 or 1 on h . <p> i i + a (u 1 ; u 1 ) (1 + log H=h) 2 a (u; u) (1 + `) 2 a (u; u) (4.28) The proof of this result, for fi = 1=2, can be found in the proofs of Theorem 6 and 7 of Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>. For different values of fi, we use an argument similar to that of the proof of Lemma 4.2. Returning to the proof of Theorem 4.2, we find that (4.20) follows from Corollary 4.1, and Lemmas 4.1 and 4.5. The bound for C 0 has then been established. Assumption ii). <p> Sobolev type inequality to obtain i p2E l;h E l u (x p )) 2 i (1 + log H=h)juj 2 Results very similar to (4.30) can be found in Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [6], Bramble and Xu [9], Dryja [32], Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], and Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>. <p> By applying techniques developed in Zhang [95], and Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, we can show that the norm of the error propagation operators kE G k H 1 and kE F k H 1 can be estimated from above by 1 C (1 + `) 2 : In a case in which we have quasi-monotone coefficients and use the standard coarse space <p> Assumption i) is handled exactly as before. The only nontrivial part is to show that a (I h u; I h u) (1 + `) 2 a (u; u) 8u 2 V h The idea of the proof of (4.49) is the same as in Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>. We reduce the estimates to bounds related to the vertices, edges, and faces and use Lemma 4.5 in [35], 4.10 and 4.11. 4.8 Nonuniform refinements We now consider finite element approximation with locally nested refinement. <p> Then for any u 2 V h 0 (), we have (1 + `) 2 a (u; u) a (T NNmult u; u) a (u; u): Proof. By using the theory developed by Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu [7], Dryja, and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, and Zhang [95], we have (2 ^w) ` X X P k T m : (4.62) Here, ^w = max (1; w) = 1 for the Gauss Seidel case, and ^w = max (1; w) &lt; 2 for the damped Jacobi case; see Widlund [41]. <p> Xu [7], Dryja, and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, and Zhang [95], we have (2 ^w) ` X X P k T m : (4.62) Here, ^w = max (1; w) = 1 for the Gauss Seidel case, and ^w = max (1; w) &lt; 2 for the damped Jacobi case; see Widlund [41]. We also have (E) C for both cases; see Zhang [95]. <p> Here we have been able to draw on earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner [13], Oswald [68], as well as on recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], and Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>. We show that the condition number of the corresponding iterative methods is bounded by C (1 + log (H=h)), where H and h are the mesh sizes of the global and local problems, respectively. <p> We obtain (5.42) by showing that each term inside the sum can be bounded by C juj 2 H 1 5.1.7 The Neumann-Neumann basis In this subsection, we consider Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces. This is the nonconforming P 1 version of a coarse space studied in Dryja and Widlund <ref> [41] </ref>, and Mandel and Brezina [55]. However, here we use an approximate harmonic extension inside the substructures. We note that the coarse spaces considered by these authors differ only in how certain weights are chosen.

Reference-contexts: The divergence free invariance is obtained at the expense of solving a coarse problem and the local problems (in parallel) exactly in each iteration. In the two-dimensional case, Ewing and Wang <ref> [43] </ref> introduced a stream function to reduce (3.16) to a standard finite element elliptic problem. Therefore, if we have discontinuous coefficients across subregion interfaces, we can solve the problem by several well-known domain decomposition methods, or by the two-dimensional version of the algorithms developed in Chapter 4 of this thesis.

Reference-contexts: The main contributions of our work are discussed primarily in Chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 5 is an extension of a technical report Two-Level Schwarz Methods for Nonconforming Finite Elements and Discontinuous Coefficients which was completed in March 1993 <ref> [76] </ref>. This work was inspired by earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner [13], Oswald [65], as well as by recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], but a number of additional technical difficulties had to be overcome. They are primarily related to our efforts to treat quite general coefficients. <p> These isomorphisms were apparently first used by the author in a short version of <ref> [76] </ref> that was entered into Copper Mountain student competition in mid-December 1992. We note that recently considerable attention has been focused on related techniques for domain decomposition methods with nonconforming spaces; for second order scalar problems (cf. <p> Brenner [12], Cowsar [28, 29], Cowsar, Mandel, and Wheeler [30], Sarkis [77]), for plate elements (cf. Brenner [10]), and for non-nested meshes (cf. Cai [17, 16], Chan, Smith, and Zou [24]). We also note the face based coarse spaces, which were introduced in <ref> [76] </ref>, have also been discussed in the conforming case in the recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35]. We also introduce approximate harmonic extensions, and fi-Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces (generalizations of the Neumann-Neumann coarses space introduced by Dryja and Widlund [41], and Mandel and Brezina [55]). <p> to find a decomposition as in Assumption i) of Theorem 2.1 with v and the v i belonging to the divergence free space. iv) The method that we adopt in this thesis is based on the Arnold-Brezzi [2] theory and on our preconditioners for nonconforming P 1 finite elements problems <ref> [76, 77] </ref>; see also Chapter 5 of this thesis. <p> We then design methods with several coarse spaces, sometimes known as exotic coarse spaces; cf. Widlund [88]. Some are new and others have previously been discussed; see Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], Dryja and Widlund [41], and Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref>. One of our main results is that the condition number of the resulting systems can be estimated from above by C (1 + `) 2 with C independent of the jumps of coefficients, of the number of substructures, and also of `; see Section 4.4. <p> For problems with quasi-monotone coefficients, the standard piecewise linear functions can be used as the coarse space and optimal multilevel algorithms are obtained. In Section 4.7, we introduce approximate discrete harmonic extensions and define new coarses spaces by modifying previously known exotic coarse spaces; see Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref> and Chapter 5 for a case of nonconforming elements. Using these extensions, we can avoid solving a local Dirichlet problem for each substructure when using exotic coarse spaces [88]. <p> We first consider certain multilevel methods based on the MDS-multilevel diag onal scaling introduced by Zhang [95], enriched with a coarse space as in Dryja and Widlund [41], Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], or Sarkis <ref> [76, 77] </ref>. Let N k and N k 0 be the set of nodes associated with the space V k and V k 0 , respectively. Let k j be a standard nodal basis function of V k 0 , and let V k j = spanf k j g. <p> We now proceed to discuss several alternative coarse spaces and to establish bounds for the condition numbers of the corresponding additive multilevel methods. 4.4.1 Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces We first consider the Neumann-Neumann coarse spaces which have been analyzed in Dryja and Widlund [41], Mandel and Brezina [55], and Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref>. An interesting feature of these coarse spaces is that they are of minimal dimension with only one degree of freedom per substructure, even in the case when the substructures are not simplices. <p> We note the coarse spaces defined with fi = 1=2, fi = 1, and fi 1=2 have been used by Dryja and Widlund [41], Mandel and Brezina [55], and Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref>, respectively. 54 Recently, Wang and Xie [85] introduced another coarse space which is similar to ours with fi = 1. However, their basis functions only take the value 0 or 1 on h . <p> in Remark 3:3 in Zhang [95]. 2 Remark 4.2 Recently, Maxsymilian Dryja has proved that the estimate (4.28) can be sharpened to a (u 1 ; u 1 ) (1 + log H=h)a (u; u): (4.29) We note that this result is in agreement with a result obtained by Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref> for nonconforming spaces; see further Chapter 5. <p> However, we can define new exotic coarse spaces, denoted by V 1 , with ~ X = ~ F ; ~ E; g N N; and ~ W by introducing approximate discrete harmonic 74 extensions. They are given by simple explicit formulas <ref> [35, 76] </ref> and have the same H 1 stability estimates as the discrete harmonic extensions. Here we use strongly the fact that our exotic spaces V ~ X 1 have constant values at the nodal points of the faces of the substructures. <p> A A V k C k F ig: 4:3 E k2 To approximate the discrete harmonic function F ij in i , we use the finite element function # F ij introduced in the proof of Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35] (see also Extension 3 in Sarkis <ref> [76] </ref>), given by (see Fig. 4.3). <p> Finally, # F ij is extended by zero outside F ij . Note that # F ij 2 V h 0 , and F ij @ i We remark that other extensions are also possible; see, e.g., Extension 2 of <ref> [76] </ref>. <p> Another interesting and original part of our work is the technique that we introduce to analyze algorithms with nonconforming spaces; see Section 1.1. We introduce nonstandard local operators (see the isomorphisms in <ref> [76] </ref>) in order to map between conforming and nonconforming spaces and then obtain several results for the nonconforming case which are known for the conforming case.

Reference-contexts: In Chapter 2, we first review some iterative methods for positive definite linear system of equations. We then discuss recent results on Schwarz methods, which are regarded as generalizations of the first domain decomposition method proposed in 1869 by H. A. Schwarz <ref> [78] </ref>. In particular, a general abstract variational framework developed by Dryja and Widlund is usaed to analyze Schwarz methods in terms of subspaces and bilinear forms. <p> Questions related to convergence of the extremal eigenvalues of T m to those of BA are considered in [69]. 2.2 The Classical alternating Schwarz method It is believed that the first domain decomposition method was proposed by Hermann Amandus Schwarz in 1869 <ref> [78] </ref>. It was originally used to show the existence of the solution of an elliptic boundary value problem on domains that consists of the union of 19 simple overlapping subregions. In each subregion it is a priori known how to solve the elliptic problem.

Another technique for estimating condition numbers for preconditioned Schur complement systems was introduced by Smith, and Widlund <ref> [80] </ref>. They showed that the condition number of the preconditioned Schur complement is bounded from above by the condition number of the full linear system preconditioned by a related preconditioner.

Reference-contexts: We note that for problems with small variations in A, it can be shown that S h is spectrally equivalent to a discrete Laplacian of finite difference type (cf. Wheeler and Gonzalez <ref> [86] </ref>); therefore, there is no difficulty finding an effective preconditioner for S h and fewer iterations are needed in the outer iteration.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that if T is invertible, then the solution u of (2.5) is the only solution of T v = g; see Cai <ref> [87] </ref>. In the multiplicative Schwarz algorithm, each iteration involves N + 1 sequential fractional steps and this is not ideal for parallel computing if N is large; on an abstract level, T is not ideal for parallel computing if the degree of the polynomial poly is large. <p> Often, these subspaces are related to a decomposition of the domain into overlapping subregions. The space V 0 represents the coarse subspace and it is added to the algorithm to provide global communication of information in each iteration. We note that Widlund <ref> [87] </ref> has shown that, without a global coarse space problem, the condition number of the relevant iteration operator must grow at least like 1=H 2 , where H is the diameter of the subregions.

Reference-contexts: We introduce a coarse triangulation given by the substructures and assume that the coefficients can have large variations only across the interfaces of these substructures. We then design methods with several coarse spaces, sometimes known as exotic coarse spaces; cf. Widlund <ref> [88] </ref>. Some are new and others have previously been discussed; see Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], Dryja and Widlund [41], and Sarkis [76]. <p> Using these extensions, we can avoid solving a local Dirichlet problem for each substructure when using exotic coarse spaces <ref> [88] </ref>. We show that the converge rate estimate of our new iterative methods, with 49 approximate discrete harmonic extensions, are comparable to those using exact discrete harmonic extensions. <p> Our results have been obtained jointly with Maxsymilian Dryja and Olof Widlund. This work has already submitted for publication; see Dryja, Sarkis and Widlund [34]. See also Dryja [33], Sarkis [77], and Widlund <ref> [88] </ref>. 4.2 Assumptions and notation We assume that A (x) = (x) &gt; 0, and (x) is constant, in each substructure, with possibly large jumps occurring only across substructure boundaries. Therefore, (x) = i in each substructure i .

Reference-contexts: No regularity beyond H 1 is used. We note, however, that we cannot guarantee that the rate of convergence of these methods are insensitive to large variations in the coefficients of 122 the differential equation; see also [68], <ref> [89] </ref>, [29], and [52].

Reference-contexts: In Section 4.5, we study in detail the weighted L 2 projection with weights given by the discontinuous coefficients of the elliptic problem. Bramble and Xu [9], and Xu <ref> [90] </ref> have considered this problem and established that the weighted L 2 projection is not always stable in the presence of interior cross points. <p> It should be pointed out that the L 2 projection is not H 1 -stable in general; see the counterexample given in Xu <ref> [90] </ref>. 4.5.1 Quasi-monotone coefficients Let V m ; m = 1; ; L, be the set of substructure vertices. We also include the vertices on @.

Reference-contexts: We note, however, that the extension of the theory originally provided some difficulties; see Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu [7], Cai and Widlund [19], Dryja and Widlund [41], and Xu <ref> [91] </ref>. If a large number subdomains is used then the convergence rates of this method will typically deteriorate rapidly with the number of subdomains. This happens because such a method does not provide global communication of information in each iteration; information is passed only between neighboring 23 subdomains. <p> The multiplicative methods are variants of the multigrid V-cycle method. In our design and analysis, we use a general Schwarz method framework developed in Chapter 2. Among the particular cases, discussed here, are the BPX algorithm, cf. Bramble, Pasciak and Xu [8], and Xu <ref> [91] </ref>, and the multilevel Schwarz method with one-dimensional subspaces considered by Zhang [94, 95]; see also Dryja and Widlund [39, 40]. It is well known that these 48 methods are optimal when the coefficients are regular. The problems become quite challenging for problems with highly discontinuous coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Nested local refinements have previously been analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant [3], Bramble and Pasciak [5], Cheng [25, 26], Oswald [66, 67], and Yserentant <ref> [92, 93] </ref>. By nested local refinement we mean that an element, which is not refined at level j, cannot be a candidate for further refinement. Under certain assumptions on the local refinement, optimal multilevel preconditioners previously have been obtained for problems with nearly constant coefficients in two and three dimensions.

Under certain assumptions on the local refinement, optimal multilevel preconditioners previously have been obtained for problems with nearly constant coefficients in two and three dimensions. <p> A bound on the condition number can be derived, which is independent of the coefficients, and which grows at most as the square of the number of levels; see, e.g., Yserentant <ref> [93] </ref>. Here, we extend the analysis to the case where the coefficients are quasi-monotone with respect to the coarse triangulation or are highly discontinuous in two or in three dimensions.

The problems become quite challenging for problems with highly discontinuous coefficients. <p> We first consider certain multilevel methods based on the MDS-multilevel diag onal scaling introduced by Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>, enriched with a coarse space as in Dryja and Widlund [41], Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [35], or Sarkis [76, 77]. Let N k and N k 0 be the set of nodes associated with the space V k and V k 0 , respectively. <p> We can assume that the regions F ij , E l , and V m are convex. If not, we can extend them to convex regions and use a trick developed in Lemma 3.6. of Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>. We now decompose w (i) (i) (i) V m in the same way as the v (i) . Let us first consider w (i) F ij . <p> The bound for C 0 has then been established. Assumption ii). Trivially, we have ! = 1: Assumption iii) We need to show that (E) const. This has been established in Remark 3:3 in Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>. 2 Remark 4.2 Recently, Maxsymilian Dryja has proved that the estimate (4.28) can be sharpened to a (u 1 ; u 1 ) (1 + log H=h)a (u; u): (4.29) We note that this result is in agreement with a result obtained by Sarkis [76] for nonconforming spaces; see further <p> Let X = N N; F; E; or W . Following Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>, we consider two algorithms defined by their error propagation operators E G = ( k=0 j2N k (I P k 1 ); (4.45) E J = k=1 ` Y (I j2N k P k 1 ); (4.46) where is a damping factor chosen such that k ~ T k k <p> The products in the above expressions can be arranged in any order; different orders result in different schemes; see Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>. When the product is arranged in an appropriate order, the operators E G and E J correspond to the error propagation operators of V-cycle multigrid methods using Gauss-Seidel and damped Jacobi method as smoothers for the refined spaces, respectively.

By applying techniques developed in Zhang [95], and Dryja and Widlund [41], we can show that the norm of the error propagation operators kE G k H 1 and kE F k H 1 can be estimated from above by 1 C (1 + `) 2 : In a case in which we have quasi-monotone coefficients and <p> The proof for X = W , with a condition number estimate of C (1 + `) 3 is given in Dryja and Widlund [40] (Theorem 6.2). To obtain an improved, quadratic estimate, we can use a result of Zhang (see Remark 3:3 in <ref> [95] </ref>). Using similar arguments as in [40] and in previous sections, we can prove our current theorem for the other exotic coarse spaces as well. Another technique for estimating condition numbers for preconditioned Schur complement systems was introduced by Smith, and Widlund [80]. <p> Then for any u 2 V h 0 (), we have (1 + `) 2 a (u; u) a (T NNmult u; u) a (u; u): Proof. By using the theory developed by Bramble, Pasciak, Wang, and Xu [7], Dryja, and Widlund [41], and Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>, we have (2 ^w) ` X X P k T m : (4.62) Here, ^w = max (1; w) = 1 for the Gauss Seidel case, and ^w = max (1; w) &lt; 2 for the damped Jacobi case; see Widlund [41]. <p> We also have (E) C for both cases; see Zhang <ref> [95] </ref>. <p> We have trivially ! = 1.
