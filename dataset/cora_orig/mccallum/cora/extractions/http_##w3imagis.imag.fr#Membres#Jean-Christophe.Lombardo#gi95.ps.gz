Abstract: Originally introduced to render probabilistic objects, particle systems are now used in a wide range of applications. Oriented particle systems were designed as a dynamic modelling tool for describing 3D free-form objects. We propose a new method using oriented particle systems to dynamically simulate 3D deformable objects that may either come back to their initial shape or break during animations. This method can be used in a physically based animation system. We also propose a new more robust expression for the attraction/repulsion interaction between particles.

Reference-contexts: The system obeys solid dynamic laws. Each interaction law is mod-elled by a force and a torque. Linear acceleration can be computed from applied forces and particle mass, and angular acceleration from applied torques and inertia matrix with the standard Newtonian equations of motion <ref> [1] </ref>. The cohesion of the set of particles is ensured by the use of a long-range attraction / short-range repulsion force. <p> As in almost every interacting particle system, the force ~ F LJ used by Szeliski and Tonnesen derives from the Lennard-Jones model of intermolecular potential function 1 The system described in this section is three-dimensional, figures are drawn in 2D for a better understanding. F LJ <ref> [1] </ref> (Figure 2). F LJ (r) = r n r m ~ F LJ (~r) = ~ grad (F LJ (r)) where r is the distance between the two interacting particles, a, b, n and m are constants 2 .

Reference-contexts: These reaction forces are then expressed at the skeleton center of mass as a pair (force, torque) and integrated during the following time step. Recent work uses a non-oriented particle system as skeleton for this kind of object to model highly deformable objects. As shown in <ref> [2] </ref>, using a particle system as a set of skeletons for implicit objects means being able to dispatch reaction forces between particles, being able to re-sample efficiently implicit surfaces after a change of topology. We propose the use of an oriented particles system to handle skeletons. <p> As oriented particles are referentials, using them to handle skeletons of the implicit surface allows many improvements in this kind of modelling. Anisotropic potential functions can be used instead of distance functions used in <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. Each skeleton can be a complex object defined as a collection of primitives placed in the oriented particle referential. implicitly defined objects. The ball is a deformable object [4]. To each particle of the spiral from Figure 5 we attached a square skeleton.

Reference-contexts: The sum of external plus internal forces is zero. During the second phase, external forces are released. The spiral progressively recovers its shape (Figure 5e and Figure 5f). 6 Modelling implicit objects with shape mem ory skeleton Implicit surfaces have been used by Marie-Paule Gascuel to model deformable objects <ref> [4] </ref>. An object is defined by a set of skeletons and a set of associated potential functions. The object surface is an isosurface of the sum of all emitted potentials. The slope of the potential function around this constant defines the stiffness of the object. Each implicit surface is sampled. <p> As oriented particles are referentials, using them to handle skeletons of the implicit surface allows many improvements in this kind of modelling. Anisotropic potential functions can be used instead of distance functions used in <ref> [4, 2] </ref>.

To each particle of the spiral from Figure 5 we attached a square skeleton. Deformations of the resultant implicit surface are only due to the movements of the skeletons. Initially the spiral is in a rest state an the ball is given a linear speed to collide the spiral.

Reference-contexts: A Lennard-Jones func-tion has a steep slope near the equilibrium position r = r 0 . When discrete integration methods such as the Euler or the Newton-Cotes <ref> [9] </ref> technique are used, if the time step is too large, particles may need infinite time to reach an equilibrium state. For example, if at time t distance r between A and B is too small, a repulsion force is applied during next dt.

This function issued from gas molecular dynamics, although being commonly used to model interactions between particles, presents two main drawbacks.
