Title: Percentile Blobs for Image Similarity  
Author: Nicholas R. Howe

Affiliation: Cornell University Department of Computer Science  
Abstract: We present a new algorithm called PBSIM for computing image similarity, based upon a novel method of extracting bloblike features from images. In tests on a classification task using a data set of over 1000 images, PBSIM shows significantly higher accuracy than algorithms based upon color histograms, as well as previously reported results for another approach based upon bloblike features.

Reference-contexts: For example, many image retrieval systems make use of a suite of similarity algorithms <ref> [1, 8, 11] </ref>. Broadly speaking, previous work in image similarity falls into one of several categories according to the basic approach used.

Photobook [11] also provides an array of tools for retrieving a desired image.

PBSIM deliberately adopts a simplistic approach to this problem. Details of images are glossed over in favor of broader characteristics, allowing the algorithm to readily perform high-level generalization.

Reference-contexts: With a few exceptions, they ignore the spatial layout of the image entirely. Recently several algorithms have been proposed that attempt to integrate color and texture with spatial information. Color correlograms [7] incorporate both color and geometry. Recent work in blob-based similarity <ref> [3] </ref> and flexible templates [9] has explicitly attempted to unify all three sources of similarity information. Each of these approaches has specific strengths and weaknesses that are discussed further in Section 3.1. <p> Indeed, human notions of similarity may vary, and different definitions are appropriate for different tasks. We chose to evaluate PBSIM in an image classification task previously used to evaluate a different blob-based image similarity measure <ref> [3] </ref>. The task involves over 1000 images from the Corel photo collection, divided into a dozen categories according to their subject matter. Using leave-one-out cross validation, PBSIM was tested on its ability to correctly predict the category of an image by finding a nearest neighbor in the same category.

Reference-contexts: The success of this approach is heavily dependent on the quality of the templates provided, but the method can achieve excellent results for some types of images. One other recent image similarity algorithm that reports better results than color histograms is based primarily on the texture present in images <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach extracts textural features at multiple resolutions and orientations. De Bonet and Viola show that, for the retrieval tasks they test, their texture-of-textures (ToT) method outperforms several implementations based upon color histograms. <p> These results show the power of incorporating geometric information into the description of an image. Techniques like the standard color histogram approach [12] and the texture-of-textures algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> fail to take advantage of this rich source of information. The combination of color, texture, and geometry reveals far more about an image than any one of these properties alone.

Others, including work in face recognition and algorithms based on eigenvalues [11], rely on identifying parts of an image based upon their appearance. A third area of work in image similarity, developed primarily for use with large databases of images, revolves around comparing general properties of entire images.
