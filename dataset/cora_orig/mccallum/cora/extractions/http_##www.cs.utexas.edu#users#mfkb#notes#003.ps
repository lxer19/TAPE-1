Title: Concept Construction as Constraint Relaxation: Working Note 3  
Author: Peter Clark and Bruce Porter 
Address: UT Austin  
Affiliation: Dept. CS,

Reference: [Blair et al., 1992] <author> Blair, P., Guha, R. V., and Pratt, W. </author> <year> (1992). </year> <title> Microtheories: An ontological engineer's guide. </title> <institution> Tech Rept CYC-050-92, MCC, Austin, TX. </institution>
Reference-contexts: Before discussing this issue further, we note that it differs from the problem of terminological errors which Guha's context mechanism in CYC sought to address <ref> [Blair et al., 1992] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Mycin's reasoning can be seen as searching for a most coherent model of the patient being diagnosed. This view of expert system reasoning as searching for a coherent, problem-specific model at run-time rather than "applying rules" has been eloquently articulated by Clancey <ref> [Clancey, 1992] </ref>. As he argues, this view underlies almost all problem-solving, either implicitly or explicitly (more often implicitly, unfortunately).

Reference-contexts: It is hence not surprising that we too need to adopt this view for concept construction. 4 3.3 Coherence and Belief Revision Our notion of coherence in Section 2.2 is similar, but not quite the same, as coherence theories of belief revision <ref> [Rao and Foo, 1989a] </ref>. Rao and Foo define "maximizing coherence" as retaining as many consistent beliefs as possible during a state change [Rao and Foo, 1989b]; similarly, we are attempting to minimize the (weighted) number of axioms which are not applied to a concept description.
