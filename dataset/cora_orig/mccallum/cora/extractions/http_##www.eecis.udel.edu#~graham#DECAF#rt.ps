Title: Real-Time Agent Scheduling  
Author: John R. Graham 
Abstract: iInformation agents have until recently been confied to a single computer or a limited netowrk of computers. Now agent are being design that can travel to nhosts of dissimilar nature. The advantage is the ability to build very large task systems to solve large problems ina distributed fashion. One of the problems associated with such a system is applying some real-time performance constraints to the system. The paper will attempt to identify current efforts in this area and propose a direction of solving the general problem of scheduling distributed computing agents in a real-time environment.
