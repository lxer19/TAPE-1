Reference-contexts: We prove here that the answer is yes , even under considerably general condition, but first we concetrate on those two examples. We relay on a theorem (1.4) quoted form Ajtai <ref> [A] </ref>. 1 Random 2-place function and random graph with order. <p> Proof By Ajtai <ref> [A] </ref>, 5.7 (i.e. by its proof), provided that throghout we use "balanced cilinders" were Definition 1.5 we call a subset A of n 2 a balanced cilinder if it has the form ff 2 n 2 : f extend f 0 g , with f 0 balanced , which means: jfi

Reference-contexts: time whether we can really interprate arithmetic up to n on the random model ([n]; F n ) (i.e. with large probability ) so that we can e.g. find a sentence , almost surely true if n even and almost surely false if n is odd (as in Kaufman Shelah <ref> [KfSh201] </ref>) or not. <p> Hopefully there is a threshold phenomena. Probably this family of problems will appeal to mathematicians with an analytic background. (6) If we use logic stronger than first order , it cannot be too strong (on monadic logic see <ref> [KfSh201] </ref>), but we may allow quantification over subsets of size k n , e.g. log (n) there are two issues: (A) when for both n and n + 1 we quantify over subsets of size k n , we should just increase M by having the set [n] k n as

Reference-contexts: Two years ago, looking at a similar situation (from Luczak Shelah <ref> [LuSh435] </ref>) we succeed in [Sh463] to give it a reasonable answer in its context : we cannot push the result to the maximum, because the very weak zero-one law hold where: Definition 0.2 The very weak zero one law hold for the logic L and h (K n ; n )

Reference-contexts: Two years ago, looking at a similar situation (from Luczak Shelah [LuSh435]) we succeed in <ref> [Sh463] </ref> to give it a reasonable answer in its context : we cannot push the result to the maximum, because the very weak zero-one law hold where: Definition 0.2 The very weak zero one law hold for the logic L and h (K n ; n ) : n &lt; !i <p> hold where: Definition 0.2 The very weak zero one law hold for the logic L and h (K n ; n ) : n &lt; !i if for every 2 L we have: lim [Prob n+1 (M n j= ) Prob n (M n j= )] = 0 But in <ref> [Sh463] </ref> I was not able to find if that law holds for the two context discused above, which look much simpler and immediate to formulate than the one solved there. <p> Note that this is equivalent to the previous random choice of P ` n . End of the pf of Theorem 1.1,1.2 By Theorem 1.4 and clause (2) of the Fact from stage B above. 1:1 1:2 fl fl fl Discussion 1.6 (1) Note that the results of <ref> [Sh463] </ref> cannot be gotten in this way as the proof here use high symmetry (2) We may want to phrase the result generally; One way: just say that M n ; M n+1 can be gotten as above : draw a model on [2n + 1] (i.e. with this universe), then <p> Easily fall under 1.6 (2). (4) All this is for fixed probabilities; we then can allow probabilities depending on n so that each model A is replaced by an A n i.e. it vary with n. (5) As said in <ref> [Sh463] </ref> we can also consider lim (Prob h (n) (M h (n) j= )Prob n (M n j= )) = 0, i.e. characterize the function h for which this holds. Hopefully there is a threshold phenomena.
