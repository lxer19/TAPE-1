Abstract: An algorithm for deadlock-free routing in bidirectional ring structures in multicomputer networks is presented. This algorithm provides greater throughput and lower message latencies than those of previously presented ring routing algorithms. Insight into these results is given by a message traffic analysis, and increased performance for wormhole-routed networks is quantified through simulation experiments. Additionally, a routing element which implements this algorithm is shown to be simpler and faster than that for a currently-used algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The present generation of multicomputers is able to reduce hardware communication overheads of first-generation machines by over two orders of magnitude by employing innovative routing techniques based on virtual cut-through routing [8] or its blocking variant, wormhole routing <ref> [1] </ref>. Wormhole routing is a pipelined, circuit-switching mechanism that is being used in several multicomputers such as the Intel Paragon [6] and the Cray T3D [2]. It is particularly popular because it has a simple hardware implementation that can provide for high-bandwidth/low-latency communication.

It is particularly popular because it has a simple hardware implementation that can provide for high-bandwidth/low-latency communication. Unfortunately, wormhole routing has the blocking property characteristic of circuit-switched networks. <p> More recently, the KSR1 multicomputer employed a hierarchy of rings to serve as a communications backbone [7]. Also, the Cray T3D contains a 3D torus, where any contiguous set of nodes along a dimension are connected by a ring <ref> [2] </ref>. The ring and torus connections are starting to gain favor over mesh-connected (no wraparounds) networks primarily because the diameter of a ring is half that of a linear strip, which contains no wraparound connections. <p> One commonly used routing algorithm for multicomputer rings is one which uses virtual channels to embed a spiral in the ring to achieve deadlock-free routing. This scheme was introduced with the design of the TRC [4] and is used on the Cray T3D <ref> [2] </ref>. While this algorithm is appropriate for unidirectional rings, other allocations are possible for bidirectional rings. In this paper, the Red Rover algorithm for deadlock-free routing on bidirectional rings is presented. The algorithm is applied to wormhole-routed networks in this paper, although it can also be used with store-and-forward routing.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, its performance degrades rapidly as the message traffic increases beyond some level as a high percentage of the messages get blocked before they can reach their destination. The other drawback of a blocking technique is the possibility of deadlock if the routing scheme is not appropriately constrained <ref> [3] </ref>. A good introduction to various aspects of wormhole routing is found in [9]. Another trend in multicomputers is the use of the ring as the interconnection network, either as the entire routing network or as a subgraph of the network. <p> Routing is assumed to be deterministic and minimal, i.e., for any source-destination pair, only one route may be used, and it must be the shortest route. Notice that deadlock cycles can occur within a ring due to the wraparound channels. As suggested by Dally and Seitz <ref> [3] </ref>, virtual channels are used to transform these cycles into spirals. In this scheme, all channels in a unidimensional cycle are broken up into pairs of virtual channels (refer to Figure 2). A virtual channel pair is implemented by time-multiplexing onto the associated physical channel. <p> to support deadlock-free routing in general k-ary n-cubes by coupling it with a dimension ordering. 0 1 k 1 - - - rrr rrr c 0+;B c 1;B c 1+;B c 2;B c (k2)+;B c (k1);B c 0;B - c (k1)+;A 3 The Red Rover Routing Algorithm As shown in <ref> [3] </ref>, some ordering of resources is necessary to provide deadlock prevention in routing on networks with wraparound connections, e.g., rings. For unidirectional rings, imposing an ordering via the utilization of virtual channels to effectively transform the ring into a spiral is as plausible a solution as any. <p> Given these assumptions, we wish to obtain values for the message traffic rate on each virtual channel in the network for both the Red Rover algorithm and the spiral algorithm of Dally and Seitz <ref> [3] </ref>. Because of the symmetry of the network, it is necessary only to analyze one direction of channels. We therefore confine our analysis to the negative channels and state that similar findings result for the positive channels. We will first analyze the negative A channels for the Red Rover scheme. <p> By coupling this scheme with a dimension ordering, the algorithm extends to general k-ary n-cubes. This algorithm is better at distributing the message traffic among virtual channels than the spiral algorithm of <ref> [3] </ref>. It thus makes the routing network more symmetric, causing it to provide lower message latencies and higher throughput than the spiral algorithm. This property has been indicated by a message traffic analysis and validated through simulation experiments on a variety of network sizes and message lengths.

Reference-contexts: Another trend in multicomputers is the use of the ring as the interconnection network, either as the entire routing network or as a subgraph of the network. Perhaps the first mention of the ring structure for use in a multicomputer was the design of the Torus Routing Chip (TRC) <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This property is especially critical because virtual channels help alleviate the blocking penalty of wormhole routing by providing the means for messages to bypass blocked messages. Another observation is that the most heavily-used channels are adjacent to each other in the spiral routing scheme. As quantified in <ref> [5] </ref>, the pipelined and blocking nature of wormhole routing causes the waiting times of channels to increase the waiting times of preceding channels.
