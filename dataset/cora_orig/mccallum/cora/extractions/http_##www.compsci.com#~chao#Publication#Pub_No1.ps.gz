Title: An Approach to Integer Wavelet Transformations for Lossless Image Compression  
Author: Hongyang Chao, Paul Fisher and Zeyi Hua 
Date: September 1996, Last revised December 1997  
Abstract: We developed a general way to create integer wavelet transformations that can be used in lossless (reversible) compression of images with arbitrary size. The method, based on some updating techniques such as lifting and correction, allows us to generate a series of reversible integer transformations which have the similar features with the corresponding biorthogonal wavelet transforms and some non-orthogonal wavelet transforms; but need only be calculated with integer addition and bit-shift operations. In addition, the integer wavelet transforms created in this paper possess a property of precision preservation (PPP). This property is very useful, in lossless compression, for conserving memory in both compression and decompression, and speeding up the computational process. The wavelet transform has been proven to be one of the most powerful tools in the field of image compression. In general, wavelet based image compression can be divided into three steps: wavelet transform, quantization and entropy coding. Theoretically, the wavelet transformation part is considered lossless since the transformation is reversible in the sense of mathematics. However, most transformations are lossy in practice, because all computers have only finite precision, even if we use floating point calculations. This fact is a limitation for lossless image compression by wavelet transform based algorithms. We are going to develop a general way to create reversible integer transforms, especially wavelets. All of wavelet transforms created here possess the property of precision preservation (PPP), which we will explain later in this paper. There are several reasons for creating this kind of reversible wavelets: The first reason is, of course, for the purpose of lossless image compression. Lossless image compression is very important for images found in such applications as medical and space science. In such situations, the designers of the compression algorithm always try to compress the information as much as possible; and they also must be very careful to avoid discarding any information that may be required or even useful at some later point. Some of lossless image compression algorithms are based on the so called predictive transforms [5, 8-9], which are widely used in practice. However, this method x1. Introduction

Lifting Scheme and Integer Biorthogonal Filtering In this section, we will discuss how to generate an integer reversible scheme for a pair of given biorthogonal filters with the aid of the lifting approach. The Lifting scheme, discovered by Sweldens <ref> [1] </ref>, is a new approach for constructing biorthogonal wavelets with compact support. However, the most interesting part of this method for us is: it can be used, with minor modification, to create integer wavelets which are "similar" to the given biorthogonal wavelets with compact support. <p> Here, "similar" means the decomposition results from the integer wavelet are the same as those of the corresponding biorthogonal wavelet, except the rounding error and some scaling factors. We will describe it below. The following lemma is the main result of the lifting scheme <ref> [1] </ref> reported as corollary 6 in that paper. Lemma 4.1. <p> If we have a pair of given biorthogonal wavelet filters, and try to get an integer version without losing any beneficial features of the filters, we suggest using the lifting technique. For example, all interpolation wavelets <ref> [1] </ref> can be modified to be corresponding integer wavelets without loosing any properties of the original wavelets. On the other hand, if we want to create some new integer transforms which have to match some expected features, then the correction method is a good choice.

In general, we recommend choosing fi j = 0 since it makes the choice of the parameters less complicated. <p> As mentioned above, the lifting scheme is a special case of the correction method. Examples 3 and 4 can also be considered as the illustrations of this method. S+P wavelet <ref> [3] </ref>, which does not result in a closed form of compact supported biorthogonal filters, is a typical example of correction method.
