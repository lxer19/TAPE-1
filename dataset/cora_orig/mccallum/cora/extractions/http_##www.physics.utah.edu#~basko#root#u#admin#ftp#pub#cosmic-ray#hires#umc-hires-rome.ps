Abstract: A description of the HiRes-CASA-MIA coincident data analysis is presented. The process of shower geometrical reconstruction via a hybrid method is described. Distributions of shower core locations, arrival direction, muon size, and the preliminary energy from HiRes are presented for a selected set of events.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Utah High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) prototype detector <ref> [1] </ref> is being operated in conjunction with the nearby Chicago Air Shower Array (CASA) and the Michigan Muon Array (MIA) [2] at Dugway, Utah, USA. A unique set of properties of extensive air showers (EAS) are routinely being observed at energies just above the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum.

We have estimated the fit uncertainty in N using the bootstrap method [4]. 95% of the events have uncertainties 41% and half of the events have uncertainties 7.6%.

This is well within the estimated difference in N between Fe showers and proton showers of the same energy. 3 Some Observed Shower properties The shower cores are distributed as in Figure 1.
