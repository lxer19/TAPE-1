Note: Chapter 11 Digital Libraries This draft has been prepared to appear as Chapter 11 in Modern Information Retrieval, AWL England, 1999:  "The benefits of digital libraries will not be appreciated unless they are easy to use effectively." [LGM95] 11.1 Introduction  
Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) is essential for the success of digital libraries (DLs), so they can achieve high levels of effectiveness while at the same time affording ease of use to a diverse community. Accordingly, a significant portion of the research and development efforts related to DLs has been in the IR area. This chapter reviews some of these efforts, organizes them into a simple framework, and highlights needs for the future. Those interested in a broader overview of the field are encouraged to refer to the excellent text by Lesk [Les97] and the high quality papers in proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries Conferences. Those more comfortable with online information should refer to D-Lib Magazine [Fri98], the publications of the NSF/ARPA/NASA Digital Libraries Initiative (DLI) [Har98], or online courseware [FG]. There also have been special issues of journals devoted to the topic [FL93, FAFL95, SC96]. Recently, it has become clear that a global focus is needed [FM98] to extend beyond publications that have a regional [Bar97] or national emphasis [DB94].

Reference-contexts: Federated search has had an interesting history, with workers adopting a variety of approaches. First, there are those interested in collecting the required information, often through Web crawling of various sorts [SE95]. Second, there are those focusing on intelligent search <ref> [ACHK93] </ref>. One example is work emphasizing picking the best sites to search [BP94]. These efforts often assume some integrated information organization across the distributed Internet information space [II96]. Third, there is work on fusion of results.

Reference-contexts: Digital objects have associated metadata, that can be managed in sets [Lag96]. Repositories of digital objects can provide security, and respond to an access protocol <ref> [Arm98] </ref>. Significant progress has been made towards adopting a scheme of digital object identifiers, first illustrated by OCLC's Persistent URLs [Teac], and agreement seems likely on a standard for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) [Fou98].

Reference-contexts: Scenarios have been essential to our understanding of these different DL user communities' needs [LGM95], and are particularly important in connection with social issues <ref> [Bak96] </ref>. Since the 4S model can be used to describe work on databases, HCI, hyperbases, multimedia systems, and networks, as well as other fields related to library and information science, we refer to it below to help unify our coverage and make sure that it encompasses all aspects of DLs. <p> Their functional capabilities support the information needs and uses of that community. DL is an extension, enhancement, and integration of a variety of information institutions as physical places where resources are selected, collected, organized, preserved, and accessed in support of a user community." <ref> [Bak96] </ref>. This definition has many aspects relating to 4S, but largely omits streams, and only indirectly deals with spaces by calling for extensions beyond physical places. Its coverage of scenarios is weak, too, only giving vague allusion to user support. <p> multimedia digital formats." [BDMW95] While brief, this definition does tie closely with 4S, though it is weak on scenarios, only mentioning the vague and limited concept of "access." To the IR community a DL can be viewed as an extended IR system, in the context of federation and media variations <ref> [Bak96] </ref>. Also, DLs must support (large) collections of documents, searching, and cataloging/indexing. 11.3.

Reference-contexts: The 1996 event was more focussed due to greater progress in building and studying usability of DLs [Gra97a]. Thus there was discussion of Stanford's SenseMaker system which supports rapid shifting between contexts that reflect stages of user exploration <ref> [Bal97] </ref>. Social concerns that broaden the traditional IR perspective were highlighted [Her96]. In addition, there was movement towards metrics (see discussion earlier about DL metrics) and factors for adopting DLs [Kan]. DL interfaces and usability concerns have been central to many efforts at Xerox PARC.

Reference-contexts: described by DL image collections [GMS + 98], when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.) afforded by a DL, some method of payment is often required <ref> [CTS95, CKP + 95, BB97, FW97] </ref>. Though previously access to scientific literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [Gue98], DLs clearly must manage intellectual property [MD94]. These services must support agreed-upon principles [All97], copyright practices [Sam97], as well as contracts and other agreements and laws [Har97].

Reference-contexts: Yet, even more important than new protocols for DL federated search is agreement on metadata schemes, which does seem feasible. 11.6.2 Metadata In the broadest sense, metadata can describe not only documents but also collections and whole DLs along with their services <ref> [BCGP97] </ref>. In a sense, this reflects movement towards wholistic treatment like 4S. Yet in most DL discussions, metadata just refers to a description of a digital object. This is precisely the role played by library catalog records.

Reference-contexts: These problems shift, and sometimes partially disappear, when one considers the entire life and social context of a document <ref> [BD96, HKB96] </ref> or when DLs become an integral part of automation efforts that deal with workflow and task support for one or more document collections. 8 CHAPTER 11.

Reference-contexts: and services are of particular importance to the development community [GFA + 94], as are definitions concerned with distributed multimedia information systems: "The generic name for federated structures that provide humans both intellectual and physical access to the huge and growing worldwide networks of information encoded in multimedia digital formats." <ref> [BDMW95] </ref> While brief, this definition does tie closely with 4S, though it is weak on scenarios, only mentioning the vague and limited concept of "access." To the IR community a DL can be viewed as an extended IR system, in the context of federation and media variations [Bak96]. <p> At Stanford, the key concern has been interoperability [PCGMW98]. Their "InfoBus" [PCGM + 96] allows a variety of information resources to be connected through suitable mediators, and then used via the shared bus through diverse interfaces. At the University of Michigan, the emphasis has been on agent technologies <ref> [BDMW95] </ref>. This approach can have a number of classes of entities involved in far-flung distributed processing. It is still unknown how efficiently an agent-based DL can operate. Ultimately, software to use in DLs will be selected as a result of comparisons.

Reference-contexts: Since each nation wishes to share the highlights of its history, culture, and accomplishments with the rest of the world, developing a DL can be very helpful <ref> [Ber95] </ref>. Indeed, we see many nations with active DL programs [FM98] and there are many others underway or emerging. One of the largest efforts is the European ERCIM program [fIM98]. This is enhanced by the large eLib initiative in UK [fLN98].

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is likely that in general, as DL usage spreads, there will be an increase in understanding, a shift in what capabilities users expect, and a variety of extensions to the interfaces now considered. Early in the DLI work, DL use was perceived as a research focus <ref> [Bis95] </ref>, and understanding and assessing user needs became a key concern [HLBB96]. For two years, a workshop was held at the Allerton conference center of the University of Illinois on this topic.

Reference-contexts: Third, there is work on fusion of results. This can be viewed in the abstract, regardless of whether the various collections are nearby or distributed, with the target of improving retrieval by culling from a number of good sources <ref> [BKFS95] </ref>. One approach adopts a probabilistic inference net model [CLC95]. Another views the problem as database merging [VT97]. Alternatively, one can assume that there are a number of search engines distributed to cover the collection, that must be used intelligently [GWG96].

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is important to note that the DLI efforts all spent time on interface issues. Stanford used animation and data flows to provide flexible manipulation and integration of services [CPW + 97]. At Michigan, there were studies of the PAD++ approach to 2-D visualization <ref> [BSH94] </ref>. Further discussion of interfaces can be found below in the section on usability. It should be noted that these projects only partially covered the 4S issues. Structure was not well studied, except slightly in connection with the Illinois work on SGML and the Berkeley work on databases.

Thus, in Libraries of the Future, Licklider lays out many of the challenges, suggests a number of solutions, and clearly calls for IR-related efforts [Lic65].

Reference-contexts: Structure is also important in retrieval. Macleod was one of the first to describe special concerns related to IR involving structured documents [Mac90]. Searching on structure as well as content remains one of the distinguishing advantages of IR systems like OpenText (formerly "PAT" <ref> [BYG89] </ref>). Ongoing work considers retrieval with structured documents, such as with patterns and hierarchical texts [KM93].

Reference-contexts: For efficiency purposes, especially when handling millions of documents and gigabytes of space, compression is crucial [WMB94]. While that is becoming more manageable, converting very large numbers of documents using high quality representations <ref> [CG94] </ref> can be prohibitively expensive, especially relative to the costs of retrieval, unless items are popular. All of these matters relate to the view of a document as a stream (along with one or more organizing structures); alternatively one can use scenarios to provide focus on the usage of documents.

Reference-contexts: To tackle this problem, one approach has been to develop a description language for each DL, and to build federated search systems that can interpret that description language <ref> [CGMH + 94] </ref>. However, when DL content is highly complex (e.g., when there are "unstructured" collections, meaning that the structure is complex and not well described), there is need for richer description languages and more powerful systems to interpret and support highly expressive queries / operations [Wona].

Reference-contexts: Structure is often important in documents when one wants to add value or make texts "smart" <ref> [Che97] </ref>. It can help identify important concepts [PJ93]. SGML is often used to describe structure since most documents fall into one or more common logical structures [Sum95], that can be formally described using a Document Type Definition (DTD).

Reference-contexts: Third, there is work on fusion of results. This can be viewed in the abstract, regardless of whether the various collections are nearby or distributed, with the target of improving retrieval by culling from a number of good sources [BKFS95]. One approach adopts a probabilistic inference net model <ref> [CLC95] </ref>. Another views the problem as database merging [VT97]. Alternatively, one can assume that there are a number of search engines distributed to cover the collection, that must be used intelligently [GWG96].

Reference-contexts: The key aspects of this matter are surveyed in [OD96]. At the foundation, there are issues of character encoding. Unicode provides a single 16-bit coding scheme suitable for all natural languages <ref> [Con] </ref>. However, a less costly implementation may result from downloading fonts as needed from a special server or gateway, or from a collection of such gateways, one for each special collection [DMS + 97]. The next crucial problem is searching multilingual collections.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned briefly above, many nations around the world have priceless antiquities that can be more widely appreciated through DLs [GMS + 98]. Whether in pilot mode or as a commercial product, IBM Digital Library <ref> [Cor98] </ref>, with its emphasis on rights management, has been designed and used to help in this regard. These projects all require multimedia and multilingual support, as discussed earlier. Different scenarios of use are appropriate in different cultures, and different structures and spaces are needed for various types of collections.

Reference-contexts: described by DL image collections [GMS + 98], when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.) afforded by a DL, some method of payment is often required <ref> [CTS95, CKP + 95, BB97, FW97] </ref>. Though previously access to scientific literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [Gue98], DLs clearly must manage intellectual property [MD94].

There were discussions of fundamental issues, such as information, from a human factors perspective <ref> [Dil] </ref> as well as specific explorations of tasks like document browsing [Maa]. The 1996 event was more focussed due to greater progress in building and studying usability of DLs [Gra97a].

DIGITAL LIBRARIES [KW95, Arm95, ABO97, Arm98]) 11.4. DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS 7 Two large DLI projects have devoted a good deal of attention to architecture, taking radically different approaches. <p> At the heart of NCSTRL is a simple search system, a well-thought-out open federated DL protocol and the Dienst reference implementation, developed at Cornell University <ref> [DL94] </ref>. While this system was custom-built with little dependence on other software, its type of operation could be constructed more rapidly atop various supports like CORBA [Vin97]. Federated search has had an interesting history, with workers adopting a variety of approaches. <p> Also mentioned earlier is the NCSTRL effort, starting with CS technical reports, in which the Dienst protocol was developed <ref> [DL94] </ref>. This is a "lighter" protocol than Z39.50, designed to support federated searching of DLs, but to date the only implementation is from Cornell. It seems suitable for electronic theses and dissertations as well as technical reports, and so it has been considered in regard to NDLTD.

Reference-contexts: It is very important in the DL field, and can be encoded using SGML, or easily converted to simpler metadata schemes like the "Dublin Core" [oC97]. Other "crosswalks" exist between Dublin Core (DC), MARC, and schemes like GILS, proposed for a Government Information Locator Service <ref> [DO97] </ref>. A mapping also exists between DC and the Z39.50 protocol discussed in the previous section [LeV98]. DC is a simple scheme, with 15 core elements that can be used to describe any digital object. What is of real import is that it has been widely accepted.

Indeed, to properly handle the complexity of multimedia collections, very powerful representation, description, query and retrieval systems, such as those built upon logical inference <ref> [Fuh98] </ref>, may be required. 11.4.3 Structured Documents While multimedia depends on the stream abstraction, structured documents require both the abstractions of streams and structures.

Reference-contexts: described by DL image collections [GMS + 98], when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.) afforded by a DL, some method of payment is often required <ref> [CTS95, CKP + 95, BB97, FW97] </ref>. Though previously access to scientific literature was not viewed as a commodity as it is today [Gue98], DLs clearly must manage intellectual property [MD94]. These services must support agreed-upon principles [All97], copyright practices [Sam97], as well as contracts and other agreements and laws [Har97].

Reference-contexts: example, since DLs typically include both documents and meta-data describing them, it is important to realize that metadata as in MARC (Machine-Readable Catalog) records can be represented as an SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) document, and that SGML content can be included in the base document and/or be kept separately <ref> [Gay96] </ref>. Structure is often important in documents when one wants to add value or make texts "smart" [Che97]. It can help identify important concepts [PJ93]. <p> Hence, cataloging schemes like MARC are a starting point for many metadata descriptions [oC98a]. While MARC has been widely used, it usually involves working with binary records which must be converted for interchange. One alternative is to encode MARC records using some readable coding scheme, like SGML <ref> [Gay96] </ref>. Another concern with MARC is that there are a number of national versions with slight differences, as well as differences in cataloging practices that yield the MARC records. USMARC is one such version.

Reference-contexts: Its coverage of scenarios is weak, too, only giving vague allusion to user support. In contrast, definitions that emphasize functions and services are of particular importance to the development community <ref> [GFA + 94] </ref>, as are definitions concerned with distributed multimedia information systems: "The generic name for federated structures that provide humans both intellectual and physical access to the huge and growing worldwide networks of information encoded in multimedia digital formats."

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is little agreement even regarding attempts at integrating database management and text processing approaches <ref> [GFHR97] </ref>. Sometimes, though, it is easier to solve a hard problem if one takes a broader perspective and solves a larger problem. Accordingly we briefly and informally introduce the "4S" model as a candidate solution and a way to provide some theoretical and practical unification for DLs.

Reference-contexts: IBM developed the Query by Image Content (QBIC) system for images and video [FSN + 95] and has generously helped build a number of important image collections to preserve and increase access to key antiquities <ref> [GMS + 98] </ref>. Similarly, the Carnegie Mellon University DLI project, Informedia [Teaa], has focused on video content analysis, word spotting, summarization, search, 11.4. DOCUMENT MODELS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND ACCESS 9 and in-context results presentation [Teaa]. <p> Ultimately, however, there are rich types of use of DL content, once one of these approaches to search is carried out. 11.4.6 Access When priceless objects are described by DL image collections <ref> [GMS + 98] </ref>, when collections are large and/or well organized so as to appear of value to communities of users, or when there are valuable services in information manipulation (searching, ordering, reporting, summarizing, etc.) afforded by a DL, some method of payment is often required [CTS95, CKP + 95, BB97, FW97]. <p> For information on other nations, see the online table pointing to various national projects associated with a recent special issue on this topic [FM98]. As mentioned briefly above, many nations around the world have priceless antiquities that can be more widely appreciated through DLs <ref> [GMS + 98] </ref>. Whether in pilot mode or as a commercial product, IBM Digital Library [Cor98], with its emphasis on rights management, has been designed and used to help in this regard. These projects all require multimedia and multilingual support, as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: A less intrusive approach, but one harder to implement and enforce, is to have some mechanism to translate from a special server 18 CHAPTER 11. DIGITAL LIBRARIES or gateway system to/from each of the information sources of interest. The STARTS protocol <ref> [Gra] </ref> was proposed to move in this direction, but competition among search services on the Internet is so severe that acceptance seems unlikely. Though this is unfortunate, simple federated schemes have been implemented in the DLI projects at Stanford and Illinois, and a simple one is in use in NDLTD.

Reference-contexts: Early in the DLI work, DL use was perceived as a research focus [Bis95], and understanding and assessing user needs became a key concern [HLBB96]. For two years, a workshop was held at the Allerton conference center of the University of Illinois on this topic. Since the 1995 event <ref> [Gra96] </ref> had a diverse group of researchers, it was necessary to understand the various perspectives and terminologies. There were discussions of fundamental issues, such as information, from a human factors perspective [Dil] as well as specific explorations of tasks like document browsing [Maa].

Reference-contexts: There were discussions of fundamental issues, such as information, from a human factors perspective [Dil] as well as specific explorations of tasks like document browsing [Maa]. The 1996 event was more focussed due to greater progress in building and studying usability of DLs <ref> [Gra97a] </ref>. Thus there was discussion of Stanford's SenseMaker system which supports rapid shifting between contexts that reflect stages of user exploration [Bal97]. Social concerns that broaden the traditional IR perspective were highlighted [Her96].

Reference-contexts: Yet, defining DLs truly should occur in the context of other related entities 4 CHAPTER 11. DIGITAL LIBRARIES and practices <ref> [Gra97b] </ref>. Thus, a "digital archive" is like a DL, but often suggests a particular combination of space and structure, and emphasizes the scenario of preservation, as in "digital preservation" that is based upon digitization of artifacts.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, we see many nations with active DL programs [FM98] and there are many others underway or emerging. One of the largest efforts is the European ERCIM program [fIM98]. This is enhanced by the large eLib initiative in UK [fLN98]. There are good results from activities in New Zealand <ref> [Gro] </ref> and Australia [Ian96]. In Singa-pore, billions are being invested in developing networked connectivity and digital libraries as part of educational innovation programs [RS].

Reference-contexts: One approach adopts a probabilistic inference net model [CLC95]. Another views the problem as database merging [VT97]. Alternatively, one can assume that there are a number of search engines distributed to cover the collection, that must be used intelligently <ref> [GWG96] </ref>. Fourth, there are commercial solutions, including through special WWW services [Dre]. Probably the most visible is the patented, powerful yet elegant, approach by Infoseek Corporation [Cor]. Finally, there is a new line of work to develop comprehensive and realistic architectures for federated search [DADA97, DAAP98].

Reference-contexts: DC is a simple scheme, with 15 core elements that can be used to describe any digital object. What is of real import is that it has been widely accepted. That is because there have been several years of discussion and development, focussed around five international workshops <ref> [WGMD95, Onl96, Mil96, Woo97, Hak97] </ref>. The core elements include seven to describe content (Title, Subject, Description, Source, Language, Relation, and Coverage). There are four that deal with intellectual property issues (Creator, Publisher, Contributor, and Rights).

Reference-contexts: and other subsequent discussions, then, we explore a number of definitions of DLs, using 4S to help us see what is missing or emphasized in each. 11.2 Definitions Since DL is a relatively new field, many workshops and conferences continue to have sessions and discussions to define a "digital library" <ref> [Fox93, Har96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Those more comfortable with online information should refer to D-Lib Magazine [Fri98], the publications of the NSF/ARPA/NASA Digital Libraries Initiative (DLI) <ref> [Har98] </ref>, or online courseware [FG]. There also have been special issues of journals devoted to the topic [FL93, FAFL95, SC96]. Recently, it has become clear that a global focus is needed [FM98] to extend beyond publications that have a regional [Bar97] or national emphasis [DB94]. 1 2 CHAPTER 11. <p> This project also was concerned with collection building as well as testing of a variety of interfaces that were designed based on user studies. One of the most visible project efforts is the Digital Libraries Initiative, initially supported by NSF, DARPA and NASA <ref> [Har98] </ref>. Phase 1 provided funding for 6 large projects over the period 1994-1998 [SC96]. Since these projects have been described elsewhere in depth, it should suffice here to highlight some of the connections of those projects with the IR community.
