Abstract: We present the system and report our initial experiments and performance results in settings that closely resemble the dynamic behavior of a "real" network. x ASU, Tempe, AZ 85287-5406, (602) 965-5583, partha@cs.eas.asu.edu. -251 Mercer St., New York, NY 10012-1185, (212) 998-3101, kedem@cs.nyu.edu. Under varying work-load conditions, resource availability and process failures, the efficiency of the test program we present ranged from 84% to 94% bench-marked against a sequential program. fl This research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers CCR-91-03953, CCR-94-11590, and CCR-95-05519.

Reference-contexts: But unlike all of the previous systems, Calypso can mask process crashes. There have been several proposals to provide fault tolerance, mostly by augmenting an existing system. They include FT-PVM [32], FT-Linda [5], PLinda [19], and Orca [20]. A notable exception is DOME <ref> [1] </ref> that incorporated fault tolerance and load balancing form the onset. These systems provide fault tolerance by using well known mechanisms: checkpointing the data, logging messages, and using reliable atomic broadcasts. In contrast, Calypso uses a unified set of techniques to tolerate failures and slowdowns. <p> Machine C becomes available 60 seconds into the computation, and then disappears 120 seconds later. (See Figure 3.) Each machine profile P , is defined by the function availability P mapping time (in seconds) into the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then if the computation lasted for time T , the work that was made available to us is R T t=0 availability P dt.

Reference-contexts: Calypso provides a high-level programming model that relieves the programmer from handling the underlying communication layer. Another class of systems for parallel computing focuses on providing DSM (Distributed Shared Memory) across loosely-coupled workstations. IVY [29] was one of the first implementations of DSM. Midway [8], Munin <ref> [7] </ref>, and now TreadMarks [27] and Quarks provide a weaker, and sometimes multiple consistency semantics in order to improve performance. In contrast, Calypso provides a simple, and a unified programming model that separates logical and execution parallelism.
