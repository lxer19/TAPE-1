Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Fixed node degree networks constitute an important and essential component in designing any distributed system. Networks, in which degree of the nodes increases with the size of the network, are not suitable for applications involving large number of nodes <ref> [CAB93] </ref>. Fixed node-degree networks are also needed from VLSI implementation point of view [SP89]; there are applications where the computing nodes in the interconnection network can have only a fixed number of I/O ports [CAB93]. <p> with the size of the network, are not suitable for applications involving large number of nodes <ref> [CAB93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Fixed node-degree networks are also needed from VLSI implementation point of view [SP89]; there are applications where the computing nodes in the interconnection network can have only a fixed number of I/O ports [CAB93]. There are a few network graphs in the literature <ref> [PR82, LS82, PN93] </ref> where the node degree does not increase with network size; most popular among them are the De Bruijn graphs [PR82] or the Moebius graphs [LS82], but they are not regular and they are also not maximally fault tolerant. <p> There are a few network graphs in the literature [PR82, LS82, PN93] where the node degree does not increase with network size; most popular among them are the De Bruijn graphs [PR82] or the Moebius graphs <ref> [LS82] </ref>, but they are not regular and they are also not maximally fault tolerant.

Reference-contexts: Very recently authors in <ref> [VS95] </ref> have proposed a new family of regular networks of degree 3; it has been shown that the network has a has a logarithmic diameter in the number of nodes and has a vertex connectivity of 3, i.e., the graphs are maximally fault tolerant (vertex connectivity cannot exceed the node degree). <p> graphs. 2 Trivalent Cayley Graph G n In this section, we briefly recall the construction of the trivalent Cayley graphs G n to facilitate our design of the optimal routing algorithm in the next section; details about the topological properties and fault tolerance of these graphs can be found in <ref> [VS95] </ref>. <p> Figure 1 shows the trivalent Cayley graphG 3 of dimension 3. 3 Diameter and Optimal Routing Since G n is a Cayley graph <ref> [VS95] </ref>, it is vertex symmetric [AK89], i.e., we can always view the distance between any two arbitrary nodes as the distance between the source node and the identity permutation by suitably renaming the symbols representing the permutations.
