Title: Total Least Squares in Robot Calibration

Abstract: The role of input noise is seldom considered in robot calibration. The methodology of total least squares may be applied to handle both input and output noise in robot calibration. Experimentally, we apply this method towards joint torque sensor calibration, and towards kinematic calibration of a redundant parallel-drive spherical joint in a variant called the implicit loop method.

Implicit constraint equations can arise in kinematic calibration of mulitple-loop mechanisms. Even for serial chains, Hollerbach and Wampler [7] take the viewpoint that nearly all calibration methods can be cast as closed-loop methods.

Reference-contexts: The issue of input noise is known in the statistics literature as the errors-in-variables problem <ref> [3] </ref>. Figure 1A illustrates the simple case of fitting a straight line y = ax. OLS assumes that the only error is in the ouput variable y; the input variable x is presumed known exactly.

Reference-contexts: Orthogonal distance regression has been known since last century, and has been often rediscovered under various guises. In robotics and vision, one common application of orthogonal distance regression is to fit a plane to a set of measured 3D points; all 3 components of measured position have noise (e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>). The ties to the literature in the numerical analysis and statistics communities have unfortunately seldom been made. On the other hand, the major developments in these communities on handling input noise have been recent, especially for nonlinear optimization.

Reference-contexts: Key features of this method that distinguish it from previous approaches are the use of an implicit constraint equation, based on a notion that kinematic calbration approaches can nearly all be viewed as closed-loop approaches with the sensor as a joint <ref> [7] </ref>, and the use of a priori parameter estimates. In this paper, we apply this method to two different calibration problems: (1) the calibration of joint torque sensors, and (2) the calibration of a parallel-drive shoulder joint. 2. <p> Implicit constraint equations can arise in kinematic calibration of mulitple-loop mechanisms. Even for serial chains, Hollerbach and Wampler <ref> [7] </ref> take the viewpoint that nearly all calibration methods can be cast as closed-loop methods. Consider an implicit loop-closure constraint equation 0 = f (x i ; p) (10) All measurements, whether endpoint sensing or joint angles, are lumped into a measurement vector x i . <p> We wrote an algorithm in MATLAB to select 50 poses out of 450 poses to have a good observability index <ref> [7] </ref>. The weighting matrices were defined as: V p = diag [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 V x = [ 36 2 ] (25) because the results were somewhat dependent on our initial guess.

Reference-contexts: Torque Sensor Calibration Ma et al. <ref> [8] </ref> developed an autonomous joint torque sensor calibration, which utilizes combinations of single-joint rotations and an arm's own gravity load. A key feature of the approach is that nothing is assumed known about the arm's inertial parameters or of the location of a reference load in the grasp. <p> From the fitted parameters one may extract torque sensor and joint angle sensor gains and offsets; the details may be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. The ILM was applied, without however utilizing a priori parameter values.

Reference-contexts: Yet errors in the input or independent variables are often significant, and the use of OLS in the presence of input error or noise is known to lead to bias errors in the estimates <ref> [10] </ref>. The issue of input noise is known in the statistics literature as the errors-in-variables problem [3]. Figure 1A illustrates the simple case of fitting a straight line y = ax.

Reference-contexts: i ) to the line are minimized: min P X (x i ) 2 x (y i ) 2 y subject to y i c = ax i After substitution of the constraint equation, one eventually gets min 2 = i=1 2 x which is written as a 2 statistic <ref> [11] </ref>, i.e., the least-squares sum has a 2 distribution with expected value E ( 2 ) = P 1. The expected value says nothing more than that the experimentally measured standard deviations should be about the same as the a priori standard deviations. <p> The solution to the orthogonal distance objective function (8) looks like a nonlinear optimization problem, and has been solved as such in <ref> [11] </ref>. This procedure is however unnecessary in the linear case, as analytic procedures exist. The solution to the errors-in-variables problem is known as total least squares in the numerical analysis literature [12] and as orthogonal distance regression in the statistics community [2].

On the other hand, the major developments in these communities on handling input noise have been recent, especially for nonlinear optimization. Recently, Wampler et al. <ref> [13] </ref> have introduced an approach towards nonlinear orthogonal distance regression for the problem of kinematic calibration, termed the Implicit Loop Method (ILM). <p> Note that the objective function biases the solution to the a priori values. Because of the implicit constraint equation, direct substitution into the objective function to eliminate some unknowns is not possible. Instead, the equations are linearized and variable elimination is achieved through QR decomposition <ref> [13] </ref>. Let the scaled variables y and q be defined via x e = V 1=2 x y and p e = V 1=2 p q, where the superscript 1=2 means the symmetric square root. <p> Conclusions Input noise is often significant in robot calibration problems, but the approach of total least squares may be applied to these problems. we have presented the application of one variant of this method, the implicit loop method <ref> [13] </ref>, to two different calibration problems. One is torque sensor calibration, the other kinematic calibration of a rendundant parallel-drive spherical mechanism. Results indicate so far that significant although not large differences in parameter estimates are obtained over those based on OLS. Acknowledgements.
