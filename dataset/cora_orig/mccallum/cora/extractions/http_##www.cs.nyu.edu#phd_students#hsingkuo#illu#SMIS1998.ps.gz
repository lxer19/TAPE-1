Abstract: All illusory surface figures yield a perception of a surface occluding another one or the background. Occluded surfaces yield completion, a phenomena known as amodal completions. It is intriguing that for some images illusory surfaces are perceived, but not for other images (see figure 1). Also, illusory surfaces may have portions occluded. We aim to understand these phenomena. Our approach detects intensity edges and junctions. From the junctions we seek to find an optimal image organization, i.e., multiple ordered surfaces with the ordering accounting for salience. The most salient being the figure, while the other surfaces are classified as background. A decision of which surface is the top one, is made locally, at each pixel, allowing the salient surface (figure) to have portions occluded, i.e., with amodal completions. We account for a variety of imagery not explained before.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction When the Kanizsa Square <ref> [8] </ref> image and the Four Crosses image are shown (see figure 1) various possible visual organizations, figure-ground separations, are plausible. In the Kanizsa Square image the dominant organization is of a vivid (bright white) illusory square in front of four black discs with a white background.

However, their model could not distinguish between the Kanizsa Square and the Four Crosses, i.e., could not account for why the illusory square is salient in one figure but not the other.

Reference-contexts: Why do we not see the illusory white square in this case ? Why do we see an illusory white square for the Kanizsa square ? We are also intrigued by salient illusory surfaces that exhibit amodal completions (see figure 1). We follow Ringach and Shapley <ref> [13] </ref> to ar ? This work was supported by NSF CAREER award and the Sloan Foundation gue for one model that account for both phenomena, illusory completions and amodal completions.
