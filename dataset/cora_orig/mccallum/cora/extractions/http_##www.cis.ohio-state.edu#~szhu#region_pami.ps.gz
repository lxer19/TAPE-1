Title: Region Competition: Unifying Snakes, Region Growing, and Bayes/MDL for Multi-band Image Segmentation.  
Author: Song Chun Zhu and Alan Yuille 
Note: IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 18, No. 9, 1996 (final version).  
Abstract: We present a novel statistical and variational approach to image segmentation based on a new algorithm named region competition. This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/MDL criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. Indeed the classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multi-band segmentation and we demonstrate it on grey level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Image segmentation is a critical problem of early vision and it has been intensively studied. Approaches to image segmentation can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) Local filtering approaches such as the Canny edge detector <ref> [4] </ref>, (ii) Snake [19] and Balloon methods [6], [7], [37], [32](iii) Region growing and merging techniques [2], [1],[26], and (iv) Global optimization approaches based on energy functions [28] or Bayesian [10] [3], [11] and MDL (Minimum Description Length) criteria [23] [20] [18]. <p> Our approach can therefore be applied for finding individual image regions, though we only show simulations for the harder task of global segmentation. The precision of the boundary location depends on the size of the sampling windows. As for the Canny edge detector <ref> [4] </ref>, the desirable size of these windows depends on a tradeoff between the conflicting goals of maximizing the signal to noise ratio and locating the boundaries accurately. This gives rise to an uncertaincy principle [36].

Reference-contexts: Although there have been many attempts to separate the body color (r; g; b) from the specular color (r s ; g s ; b s ) [21], [15], <ref> [34] </ref>, these approaches have been demonstrated on plastic and metal objects with nice illumination. <p> This color model has allowed us to decompose the input color image into a constant color term, a varying intensity term, and the residuals on a 2D plane. Our method can be contrasted to the currently existing approaches, for example <ref> [34] </ref>, which tries to eliminate the intensity term by normalizing the input color images, i.e. sending R (x;y) 7! (R+G+B) (x;y) .

But it was not derived from MDL and the statistical meaning was not analyzed there. 6 force, is strongest at points of high curvature. Figure (2.a) shows the smoothing force at points along the region boundary.

Reference-contexts: As for the Canny edge detector [4], the desirable size of these windows depends on a tradeoff between the conflicting goals of maximizing the signal to noise ratio and locating the boundaries accurately. This gives rise to an uncertaincy principle <ref> [36] </ref>. We describe how optimally sized windows can be chosen to minimize this uncertainty. 1 Like many algorithms, the performance of region competition will depends on the initial conditions more precisely on the choice of initial "seeds". We discuss criteria for choosing such seeds. <p> This explains why region growing algorithms work for certain images. But once the window is big enough, 0 becomes a constant (see equation (23)) This corresponds to the general un certainty principle in image processing <ref> [36] </ref>. We choose the window size to be the smallest m which satisfies the inequalities (24,25). 0 1 2 R G E (f ) (x)D (f )(x) a o + - w 2 by the thick line segment becomes smaller.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Image segmentation is a critical problem of early vision and it has been intensively studied. Approaches to image segmentation can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) Local filtering approaches such as the Canny edge detector [4], (ii) Snake [19] and Balloon methods [6], [7], <ref> [37] </ref>, [32](iii) Region growing and merging techniques [2], [1],[26], and (iv) Global optimization approaches based on energy functions [28] or Bayesian [10] [3], [11] and MDL (Minimum Description Length) criteria [23] [20] [18]. <p> This derivation requires taking functional derivatives of the energy, see Appendix. The balloon models [6], [7], <ref> [37] </ref> are motivated by the desire to drive the snake automatically to a good position (thereby decreasing the dependence on the initial conditions). They introduce an additional force term ~ n (s) to Equation (2) which pushes the contour out (or in) along its normal ~ n (s) .

Reference-contexts: For example, if the data is generated by Gaussians and the variance is large, then any algorithm will have difficulty in classifying pixels, because of sample fluctuations, and so faulty segmentations may occur even if the global minimum of the MDL has been reached. It can be shown, see <ref> [41] </ref>, that if the data in a region is generated by a Gaussian with variance oe 2 then the variance of the sample variance in the region is of order oe 4 =N . <p> Our analysis will show this is the correct choice for high signal to noise ratios. Moreover, the use of windows will help reduce the oversegmentation problems due to fluctuations by effectively smoothing the sample means and variances, see <ref> [41] </ref>. <p> Moreover, we can obtain the generalized energy (17) from a maximum entropy argument 8 using Bayes theorem, see <ref> [41] </ref>, though with addition of an extra term. We can show, however, that this extra term is small and can be neglected. Hence, (17) can also be considered an MDL criterion 9 m i x R j E [I (x)] R i and R j . <p> For reasons of space we summarize the results here and refer interested readers to <ref> [41] </ref> for more details. Firstly we show that there exists an uncertainty interval 0 for the boundary, and show how to choose the size and shape of the window W to minimize 0. In the following, we use square windows and assume Gaussian distributions for mathematical convenience. <p> A seed is bad if it fails to satisfy either of these conditions, typically because it straddles the boundary between two regions. Thus to decide whether a seed is good or not we must test the sample characteristics. In <ref> [41] </ref> several tests are proposed for the special case of Gaussian models, such as skewness and kurtosis. It is illustrated that these tests automatically select "good" seeds completely inside regions and avoid selecting "bad" seeds which straddle boundaries. <p> Such domino effects will continue when more regions are involved and we think this is a key difference between the region competition algorithm and conventional region growing approaches. If seed 5 was not present the segmentation would be incorrect, see <ref> [41] </ref>. 5 Multivariate Models: Color The previous sections have described segmentation techniques where regions are considered to have homogeneous intensity properties. But the image intensity is a function both of the material properties of the object, its albedo, and the surface orientation and lighting. <p> Ideally we would estimate (r; g; b) and I (x;y) by maximizing a probability model P ((R; G; B) (x;y) j (~ i ; i ); fI (x;y) g; (r i ; g i ; b i )), see equation (9). However it turns out, see <ref> [41] </ref>, that such a model is harder to work with and requires more complex computations. Fortunately, our model is equivalent to the full probability model provided we assume that the components of the residual vectors have zero mean and identical variances. <p> This is due to the similarity of their covariance matrices, see the corresponding ellipses shown in Figure (17). Since the variances change dramatically between regions, for example, the variance in the cheetah region is about 6 2 times larger than that in the buffalo region, it can be shown <ref> [41] </ref> that the bias of the boundary location will be noticeable. This example has only used two texture filters. Recently one of us [39] developed a novel texture model which incorporates Gabor features into a probability model and is able to synthesize a large number of real textures.
