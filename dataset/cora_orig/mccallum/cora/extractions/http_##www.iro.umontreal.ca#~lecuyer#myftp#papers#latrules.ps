Title: TABLES OF LINEAR CONGRUENTIAL GENERATORS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND GOOD LATTICE STRUCTURE  
Author: PIERRE L'ECUYER 
Abstract: We provide sets of parameters for multiplicative linear congruen-tial generators (MLCGs) of different sizes and good performance with respect to the spectral test. For ` = 8; 9; : : : ; 64; 127; 128, we take as a modulus m the largest prime smaller than 2 ` , and provide a list of multipliers a such that the MLCG with modulus m and multiplier a has a good lattice structure in dimensions 2 to 32. We provide similar lists for power-of-two moduli m = 2 ` , for multiplicative and non-multiplicative LCGs.

Reference-contexts: For t &gt; 8, lower and upper bounds on fl t are available. An upper bound ae t can be deduced from Rogers' bound on the density of sphere packings (see <ref> [1, p.88] </ref>). It can be written as ae t = 2e R (t)=t ;(5) where R (t) can be found in [1] for t 24. <p> An upper bound ae t can be deduced from Rogers' bound on the density of sphere packings (see [1, p.88]). It can be written as ae t = 2e R (t)=t ;(5) where R (t) can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> for t 24. For t 25, R (t) can be approximated with O (1=t) error, and approximately four decimal digits of precision for t = 25, by R (t) = 2 4e + 2 p 5:25 ;(6) where lg is the log in base 2. <p> A lower bound can be obtained by looking at the value of d t associated with the laminated lattice in dimension t. This gives fl t ` t = 2 t , where t is given in <ref> [1, p.88] </ref> for t 48. For t 8, it turns out that ` t = fl t up to at least 52 bits of precision. Table 1 gives the ratio ` t =ae t , of the lower bound over the upper bound, for 1 t 48. <p> This yields the lower bound d t d t (m) = fl 1 t m 1=t fort 8; ae 1 t m 1=t fort &gt; 8: (7) The value of d t can be normalized to S t = d t which takes its values in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the larger the better. Following [4, 3], for any T 2, we define the figure of merit: M T = min S t :(8) The idea is to find full-period MLCGs with the best value of M T , for given m and T . <p> MLCGs with small values of m can be used for quasi-Monte Carlo integration [10] of a t-dimensional function over the hypercube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t . In that case, the function is evaluated at each of the points of T t and the integral is estimated by the average of those m function values. The size of m would depend on how much computing time we are ready to spend.

Reference-contexts: The properties of MLCGs have been studied extensively and are well-known; see, for example, <ref> [3, 5, 7] </ref>. If m is prime, a is a primitive element modulo m, and x 0 6= 0, then the sequences fx n g and fu n g are periodic with period lengths ae = m 1 and the generator is called a full period MLCG. <p> The set T t is equal to the intersection of a lattice L t with the t-dimensional unit cube [0; 1) t (see, e.g., <ref> [5, 9] </ref> for more details). This implies in particular that all the points of T t lie on a relatively small number of equidistant parallel hyperplanes. <p> The set T t is more uniformly distributed over the cube if d t is smaller. In the literature, examining the d t 's associated with a given generator is often called the spectral test <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. A general lower bound on d t is given by d fl t m 1=t ;(4) where fl t is Hermite's constant, known for t 8 (see [5]). For t &gt; 8, lower and upper bounds on fl t are available. <p> In the literature, examining the d t 's associated with a given generator is often called the spectral test [3, 5].

An upper bound ae t can be deduced from Rogers' bound on the density of sphere packings (see [1, p.88]). <p> We consider MLCGs as in (1), as well as LCGs with a nonzero additive constant, whose period length is m. MLCGs with large moduli m and good lattice structure can be used as random number generators <ref> [3, 5, 7] </ref>, e.g., for computer simulation. <p> The period length can be increased to m if (1) is replaced by: x n = (ax n1 + c) mod m;(9) where c &gt; 0 is odd, and a mod 8 = 5 (see, e.g., <ref> [3, 5] </ref>). Redefine (m) = fa 2 Z m : a mod 8 = 5g. In the case where c is odd, T t , d t (a; m), d fl t (m), etc., are defined as before.

Different models of SUN Sparcstation computers were used. These random searches gave us plenty of good multipliers.
