Abstract: We introduce Active Pages, a promising architecture for intelligent memory based upon pages of data and simple functions associated with that data [OCS98]. We evaluate the power consumption of three design alternatives for supporting Active-Page functions in DRAM: reconfigurable logic, a simple processing element, and a hybrid combination of reconfigurable logic and a processing element. Additionally, we discuss operating system techniques to manage power consumption by limiting the number of Active Pages computing simultaneously on a chip.

Reference-contexts: Various new FPGA designs have been developed solely for the purpose of implementing self-timed logic [HBBE94][MA98]. Work done at the University of Washington has shown that it is possible to implement real circuits in an asynchronous FPGA <ref> [BEHB] </ref>. Asynchronous FPGAs may prove to be a viable architecture for Active Page memory system processing elements.

Reference-contexts: If we devote half of the area of such a chip to logic, we expect the DRAM process to support approximately 32M transistors, which is enough to provide 256 LEs to each 512Kbytes sub-array of the remaining 0.5-gigabits of memory on the chip. DeHon <ref> [DeH96] </ref> gives several estimates of FPGA area, and existing prototype merged DRAM/reconfigurable logic designs demonstrate this to be a realistic design partitioning [M + 97]. 2.2 Processing Elements An alternative architecture for Active Page implementations is that of a small RISC or MISC [Jon98] type processing element used to execute user

Reference-contexts: The processing element and hybrid designs have more computational power. Furthermore, we expect to refine both of the latter designs to use less power. Refinements such as clock-gating, and asynchronous processor designs <ref> [FGT + 97] </ref> will help reduce the power consumed by processor, and hybrid processor / reconfigurable logic processor element designs. 4 Future Work Our previous work [OCS98] has shown that Active Pages are a promising architecture for intelligent memory with substantial performance benefits. <p> The increased clock speed has two disadvantages. First, the larger clock drivers consume more power. Second, overall power dissipation increases linearly with clock frequency. Recent developments have made it possible to use asynchronous logic in more complex logic designs. The AMULET2e processor <ref> [FGT + 97] </ref> is an asynchronous ARM [Fur96] 32-bit processor that consumes 30% of the power and takes 54% of the area of the ARM810 [Fur96]. An asynchronous RISC core provides a low-power means of implementing an Active Page processing element. Another possibility is the use of an asynchronous FPGA.

Reference-contexts: Such an architecture is presented in <ref> [HW97] </ref>. Here we extend this notion by simplifying the processing element core, and shrinking the reconfigurable logic array. The hybrid architecture would consist of a simplified processing element described above in Section 2.2 and a smaller reconfigurable logic array than that presented for RADram in Section 2.1.

Reference-contexts: The processor-mediated approach reduces power by not requiring extensive inter-page communication networks, and global clocking. 2.1 Reconfigurable Logic Our initial implementation of Active Pages focused upon the integration of DRAM and reconfigurable logic. For gigabit DRAMs, a reasonable sub-array size to minimize power and latency is 512Kbytes <ref> [I + 97] </ref>. The RADram (Reconfigurable Architecture DRAM) system, shown in Figure 1, associates 256 LEs (Logic Elements, a standard block of logic in FPGAs which is based upon a 4-element Look Up Table or 4-LUT) to each of these sub-arrays.

Reference-contexts: More info at http://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/RAD 2 Design Alternatives In this section we briefly present three architectures for Active Page memory systems. These architectures consist of RADram, or reconfigurable logic in DRAM [OCS98], an architecture consisting of only a small RISC or MISC <ref> [Jon98] </ref> like processing element near each page of data, and a hybrid architecture which provides a small processing element with reconfigurable logic processing capability. Currently, within all of our designs we adopt a processor-mediated approach to inter-page communication which assumes infrequent communication. <p> DeHon [DeH96] gives several estimates of FPGA area, and existing prototype merged DRAM/reconfigurable logic designs demonstrate this to be a realistic design partitioning [M + 97]. 2.2 Processing Elements An alternative architecture for Active Page implementations is that of a small RISC or MISC <ref> [Jon98] </ref> type processing element used to execute user level process functions in memory. Several low-power processing cores currently exist and Active Page designs can leverage the existing and future work in this area. However, a processing engine designed for Active Pages must satisfy two constraints: power and size.

Reference-contexts: Several low-power processing cores currently exist and Active Page designs can leverage the existing and future work in this area. However, a processing engine designed for Active Pages must satisfy two constraints: power and size. While high-performance low-power designs exist, such as the StrongARM <ref> [San96] </ref>, their size makes them prohibitive for use in Active Page memory. Due to these constraints, it will necessary to design a processor core specifically for this application. A modified MIPS instruction set machine is in the process of being modeled.
