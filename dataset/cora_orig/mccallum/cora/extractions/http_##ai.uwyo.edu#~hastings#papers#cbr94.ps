Title: An Empirical Evaluation of Model-Based Case Matching and Adaptation 1

Abstract: Rangeland ecosystems typify physical systems having an incomplete causal theory. This paper describes CARMA, a system for rangeland pest management advising that uses model-based matching and adaptation to integrate case-based reasoning with model-based reasoning for prediction in rangeland ecosystems. An ablation study showed that removing any part of the CARMA's model-based knowledge dramatically degraded CARMA's predictive accuracy. By contrast, any of several prototypical cases could be substituted for CARMA's full case library without significantly degrading performance. This indicates that the completeness of the model-based knowledge used for matching and adaptation is more important to CARMA's performance than the coverage of the case library.

Reference-contexts: Attempts have been made to construct large-scale numerical simulation models for grassland ecosystems (Rodell 1978). While such models often provide insight into the dynamics of ecosystems <ref> (Fedra 1991) </ref>, there is a general recognition that the interactions affecting grasshopper population dynamics are too poorly understood and too complex to permit precise prediction through numerical simulation (Lockwood & Lockwood 1991; Pimm 1991; Allen & Hoekstra 1992).

Reference-contexts: As with CASEY, this approach presupposes a complete and correct (though not necessarily tractable) causal model. Similarly, Goel and Chan-drasekaran's approach of using device models to adapt design cases presupposes that the device models are complete and correct (Goel & Chandrasekaran 1989). Feret and Glascow <ref> (Feret & Glascow 1993) </ref> describe an alterative approach under which model-based reasoning is used for "structural isolation", i.e., identification of the structural components of device that probably give rise to the symptoms of a fault. Cases are indexed by these tentative diagnoses, which are then refined using case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The linear approximation approach consists of a linear equation for forage consumption as a function of case feature values represented in quantitative terms. The coefficients of this equation were found using QR factorization <ref> (Hager 1988) </ref> to find a least-squares fit to the feature values and associated predictions of the cases in Set1 and ProtoL. As with ID3, ProtoL cases were treated as consisting of two cases corresponding to the minimum and maximum forage loss predictions of each prototypical case.

Reference-contexts: This should permit a more reliable evaluation of CARMA's consumption estimation module. Related Work Several previous research projects have investigated the benefits of integrating case-based reasoning with model-based reasoning. However, these projects have generally assumed the existence of a correct and complete causal model. For example, CASEY <ref> (Koton 1988) </ref> performed diagnosis using model-based reasoning to assist both case matching and case adaptation. However, CASEY presupposed both the existence of a complete causal theory of heart disease and complete explanations of each case in terms of that theory.

Reference-contexts: To determine the contribution of model-based knowledge, we performed an ablation study in which the performance of the full CARMA consumption prediction module was compared to the performance of CARMA with various model-based components removed and to two different inductive methods: ID3 <ref> (Quinlan 1986) </ref> and least-squares linear approximation. To determine the contribution of empirical knowledge, the performance of CARMA was tested with the full multiple case library replaced with single case libraries. The experimental case sets included ProtoL, Set1, and Set2.

Reference-contexts: Because the causal model in CARMA's domain is insufficient for accurate prediction and the causal explanations associated with cases are incomplete, the assumptions underlying CASEY's matching and adaptation strategies are inapplicable to CARMA's domain. Rajamoney and Lee <ref> (Rajamoney & Lee 1991) </ref> used a different approach to integrating case-based reasoning with model-based reasoning termed prototype-based reasoning. This approach uses a library of prototypes to decompose problems into familiar subprob-lems.
