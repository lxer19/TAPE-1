Note: Request for Comments: 1971 Bellcore  IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration Status of this Memo Table of Contents  
Abstract: This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This document specifies the steps a host takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its interfaces in IP version 6. The autoconfiguration process includes creating a link-local address and verifying its uniqueness on a link, determining what information should be autoconfigured (addresses, other information, or both), and in the case of addresses, whether they should be obtained through the stateless mechanism, the stateful mechanism, or both. This document defines the process for generating a link-local address, the process for generating site-local and global addresses via stateless address autoconfiguration, and the Duplicate Address Detection procedure. The details of autoconfiguration using the stateful protocol are specified elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: Any node can respond to Neighbor Solicitations for a tentative address, causing the other node to reject the address as a duplicate. This attack is similar to other attacks involving the spoofing of Neighbor Discovery messages and can be addressed by requiring that Neighbor Discovery packets be authenticated <ref> [RFC1826] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The exact length of an interface token and the way it is created is defined in a separate link-type specific document that covers issues related to the transmission of IP over a particular link type (e.g., <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>). In many cases, the token will be the same as the interface's link-layer address. 2.1. Requirements Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the significance of the particular requirements are capitalized. <p> A value of one indicates a single transmission with no follow up retransmissions. Default: 1, but may be overridden by a link-type specific value in the document that covers issues related to the transmission of IP over a particular link type (e.g., <ref> [IPv6-ETHER] </ref>). Autoconfiguration also assumes the presence of the variable RetransTimer as defined in [DISCOVERY].

Reference: [ADDR-ARCH] <author> Hinden, R., and S. Deering, </author> <title> "Internet Protocol Version (IPv6) Addressing Architecture", </title> <type> RFC 1884, </type> <month> December </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered to one of the interfaces identified by that address (the "nearest" one, according to the routing protocol's measure of distance). See <ref> [ADDR-ARCH] </ref>. solicited-node multicast address - a multicast address to which Neighbor Solicitation messages are sent. The algorithm for computing the address is given in [DISCOVERY]. link-layer address - a link-layer identifier for an interface. <p> A link-local address is formed by prepending the well-known link local prefix FE80::0 <ref> [ADDR-ARCH] </ref> (of appropriate length) to the interface token. If the interface token has a length of N bits, the interface token replaces the right-most N zero bits of the link-local prefix. If the interface token is more than 118 bits in length, autoconfiguration fails and manual configuration is required.

Reference-contexts: Stateless and stateful autoconfiguration complement each other. For example, a host Thomson & Narten Standards Track [Page 2] RFC 1971 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration August 1996 can use stateless autoconfiguration to configure its own addresses, but use stateful autoconfiguration to obtain other information. Stateful autoconfiguration is described in <ref> [DHCPv6] </ref>. The stateless approach is used when a site is not particularly concerned with the exact addresses hosts use, so long as they are unique and properly routable. The stateful approach is used when a site requires tighter control over exact address assignments.
