Reference-contexts: It is analogous to the sum statistics often used for evaluating multiple high scoring segments in pairwise sequence comparisons <ref> [ Altschul and Gish, 1996 ] </ref> . To use Eqn. (10) for computing p-values, we need to know the distribution of C r (n).

Reference-contexts: For some types of similarity scores it has been possible to derive theoretical probability distributions for similarity scores of random sequences. Most notably, the distribution of the maximal segment pair (MSP) scores used by the BLAST algorithm <ref> [ Altschul et al., 1990 ] </ref> can be calculated directly from the scoring matrix and the assumed distribution of residues in the sequence database. The distribution of MSP scores is quite different than that of motif scores, so the theory is not directly applicable.

Reference-contexts: Another type of pattern is the motif model <ref> [ Bailey and Elkan, 1994 ] </ref> . A motif model describes a (gapless) sequence pattern by specifying the probability of each letter in the alphabet at each position of the motif.

Reference-contexts: Each of the regions of high similarity describes a motif for which a model can be constructed. 1 The multiple motifs present in a family of sequences can be viewed as a 1 Computer algorithms such as MEME <ref> [ Bailey and Elkan, 1995 ] </ref> , the Gibbs sampler [ Lawrence et al., 1993 ] and Protomat [ Henikoff and Henikoff, 1991 ] exist to assist in the automatic construction of motif models. 3 pattern that defines the family. <p> If the p-value estimate is good, we would expect the fraction of sequences having p-value x or less to be equal to x. We performed this experiment for 75 motif models generated by the motif discovery program MEME <ref> [ Bailey and Elkan, 1995 ] </ref> on 75 distinct protein datasets. Each dataset consisted of all the SWISS-PROT sequences specified as belonging to a single Prosite family. The datasets are summarized in Table 1. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: We used the same 75 protein families as before and used the MEME program to discover five motifs for each family. As the search database, we used SWISS-PROT release 30 <ref> [ Bairoch, 1994 ] </ref> . To measure the quality of a sort, we chose the ROC 50 metric described in [ Gribskov and Robinson, 1996 ] . ROC metrics have the virtue that they combine measurements of the sensitivity and selectivity of a search method into a single number.

Reference-contexts: It badly underestimates the observed mean scores. The upper curve is the result of fitting the formula for E [M (n)] in Eqn. (6) to the observed data by adjusting the values of and 2 . This was done using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares curve-fitting algorithm <ref> [ Press et al., 1986 ] </ref> . The goodness-of-fit for the fitted curve is 0.366, indicating that Eqn. (6) models the data well when we adjust the estimates of the mean and variance of the subsequence scores to agree with the observed distribution.

Reference-contexts: Motif models are thus a kind of weight matrix. They are usually converted into "log-odds" matrices by dividing each frequency in each column by the background frequency of the corresponding letter and taking the logarithm. Motifs are a generalization of consensus sequences <ref> [ Stormo, 1990 ] </ref> and a specialization of profiles to cases where the gap opening costs are infinite. The main goal of searching a sequence database with a pattern is to sort the database according to the degree to which the sequences match the pattern.
