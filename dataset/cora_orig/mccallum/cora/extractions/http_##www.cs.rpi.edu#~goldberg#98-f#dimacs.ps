Title: Constructing Cliques Using Restricted Backtracking  
Author: MARK K. GOLDBERG REID D. RIVENBURGH 
Abstract: The restricted backtracking algorithmic paradigm is applied to the Maximum Clique Problem. The notion of backtracking coordinates is introduced. The program searches for those cliques whose backtracking coordinates are bounded by the values given in the input.

Reference-contexts: Our experience shows that the language of the backtracking coordinates is sufficiently flexible to enable one to utilize additional information about the problem, even though its nature may not be known beforehand. It is well known (see <ref> [6] </ref>, for example) that a greedy algorithm is generally a poor method for constructing cliques of maximal or near-maximal size. Several modifications of the greedy idea propose the selection of the next available vertex in such a way that some target function (usually, polynomially computable) is minimized. <p> Random, brock- and gen-graphs. The asymptotics of the expected sizes of maximum cliques in random graphs have been studied by many researchers ([3], <ref> [6] </ref>, [9], [12]). Let Z n;p denote the size of the largest clique in a random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and motivation The problem of constructing a clique of the maximum size in a given graph, the clique problem, was proved to be NP-hard in [10] (see also <ref> [8] </ref> and [13] for a survey on the problem). Recently, it was proved ([1]) that even constructing a clique whose size is within a factor of n * of the maximum is NP-hard (here n is the vertex number and * &gt; 0).

Reference-contexts: The child-node is generated only if q &gt; C r 1. The experiments show that such pruning is very effective for diverse types of graphs. Note that a more sophisticated pruning technique is described in <ref> [11] </ref>. Our experiments with that technique showed that using it actually increases the running time of the program. The reason for that is, apparently, that the reduction of work brought by successful applications of prunning does not make for additional work needed to perform the prunning. Reordering. <p> Short-cuts. If a degree of a vertex v is t 1 or t 2, where t is the vertex number of the graph, then v belongs to a maximum clique of this graph. In fact, it is a special case of a more general observation made in <ref> [11] </ref>. A vertex v is called anti-simplicial 3 if for any edge (u; w), (u 6= v; w 6= v), at least one of u and w is adjacent to v. Obviously, if v is anti-simplicial, then there is a maximum clique containing v. <p> Performance 3.1. Background. The problem of selecting parameters for running RB-clique can be viewed as a replacement for the original problem. There are two main modes of the selection process, "blind" and "informative". 3 In <ref> [11] </ref>, the authors deal with the problem of constructing an independent set, so they define simplicial vertices; thus, anti-simplicial vertices are simplicial in the complement to the subgraph. 6 Constructing Cliques Using Restricted Backtracking Blind.

This property of the generators was used to develop statistics of the "winning" coordinates for the brock- and gen-graphs, that were in turn fed into RB-clique when it was applied to the benchmark graphs produced by those generators.
