Title: A Linear Progamming Approach to Solving Stochastic Dynamic Programs  
Author: Michael A. Trick Stanley E. Zin 
Date: August 1993  
Abstract: Recent advances in algorithms for solving large linear programs, specifically constraint generation, motivate new algorithms for solving discrete stochastic dynamic programs. We use a standard optimal growth problem to demonstrate the performance benefits of these new algorithms for solving discrete problems and for accurately approximating solutions to continuous problems through discretization. Computational speed over value iteration is substantial. Furthermore, computational speed does not depend on the parameter settings (in particular the degree of discounting). An added benefit of a linear programming solution is the byproduct of shadow prices which we use to generate a discrete grid adaptively. That is, for a fixed number of grid points, our algorithm determines how they should be distributed over the state space to obtain greater accuracy without increasing dimensionality. fl This work was inspired by conversations with Victor Rios.
