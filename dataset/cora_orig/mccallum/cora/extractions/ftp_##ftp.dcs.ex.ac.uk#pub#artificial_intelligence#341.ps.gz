Abstract: The paper identifies and demonstrates the feasibility of a novel computational paradigm which is inspired by the principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computing. A brief history of quantum computing and basic exposition of quantum mechanics are provided, followed by a detailed description of Shor's quantum `algorithm' for factoring very large numbers. An extension to Shor's method is described, and this leads to two further applications of `quantum-inspired' methods: sorting, and the 15-puzzle. In all cases, quantum-inspired methods require the use of `classical' methods to determine whether the candidate answers provided by the quantum-inspired methods are correct. Finally, some basic methodological principles and guidelines are provided for quantum-inspired computing. The aim is not to provide a formal exposition of quantum-inspired computing but to identify its novelty and potential use in tackling NP-hard problems.

Reference-contexts: U can simulate any Turing machine with perfect precision, where a TM in turn is a theoretical model that can simulate the execution of a single algorithm on a classical computer. Deutsch <ref> [Deutsch, 1985] </ref> showed that a universal quantum computer Q can perfectly simulate any TM and can also simulate any quantum computer or simulator with arbitrary precision.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the photon as wave has gone through both slits. Similarly, a particle the position of which is given by two state vectors A and B is said to be at A and B at the same time. This is the `many universes' interpretation <ref> [Everett, 1957] </ref>: we must imagine all quantum systems exist in parallel universes. When a single photon passes through the two slits, the photon passes through the first slit in one universe, and through the second slit in another universe.

Reference-contexts: Richard Feynman <ref> [Feynman, 1982, Feynman, 1986] </ref> showed how a quantum system could be used to perform computations and could act as a simulator for probabilistically weighted quantum processes, where such simulations are impossible to achieve efficiently on a conventional probabilistic or non-deterministic automaton.

Reference-contexts: One nanometre is roughly the size of 10 atoms. 2 There is disagreement on whether quantum computers can ever be built, because of their susceptibility to noise caused by thermal vibrations and construction faults <ref> [Landauer, 1995] </ref>. 3 Strictly speaking, it cannot be called an `algorithm' since it is not guaranteed to halt or return the right results when it does halt, as will be seen later. 2 bodies some general principles which, if adopted by classical computer scientists, can offer a novel computational framework for

Reference-contexts: So although there are no known fast classical algorithms for factorising large numbers into primes, Shor's method uses known fast algorithms for taking a candidate prime factor of n and determining whether it is in fact a prime factor. Shor's method has been extended by Moore <ref> [Moore, 1995] </ref> to deal with factoring large even numbers and squares. 3.3 Moore's extension to Shor's method The following sequence of steps can lead to the identification of factors for large even numbers and squares. 1. <p> Godel numbering). 11 Two other applications not described here are quantum-inspired genetic algorithms, where each chromosome develops in its own universe with interference implementing crossover <ref> [Moore, 1995] </ref>, and quantum-inspired neural networks (QUINNs), where a neural network is trained for just one pattern in the training set, resulting in as many neural networks as training patterns with a probabilistic superpositional neural network being derived after successful training menneer95. 12 u 0 1 11 8 u 1 13

Reference-contexts: The encryption method widely employed is a DES (data encryption standard) based on RSA. RSA is named after its inventors Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman <ref> [Rivest et al., 1978] </ref> and is a public key encryption system. 8 The success of RSA depends on the seeming intractability 8 Briefly, two distinct large prime numbers are chosen randomly, p and q. Their product r = p fi q is calculated.

Reference-contexts: Computational techniques which aim to explore quantum parallelism must come up with observation methods which ensure that the universe which is collapsed into on observation somehow `represents' a solution to the problem. As well as these theoretical developments, claims have also been made recently <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref> that polynomial quantum computing algorithms exist for problems (e.g. factoring of large integers into primes, discrete logarithms) which are considered non-polynomial (i.e. NP-hard) on classical computers. <p> Despite this breakthrough, cryptographers reassured themselves with the thought of adding more digits to their codes. The problem of factoring numbers becomes exponentially harder the larger they are. However, Shor <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref> outlined a quantum algorithm that would factorise RSA-129 in a few seconds, if we could build a quantum computer that ran as fast as a modern PC. 3.2 Shor's quantum method for factorising To factor a number n (the product of two primes), specify an arbitrary number of parallel <p> The aim of this paper is not to present a formal exposition of quantum-inspired methods but to demonstrate the feasibility of such methods and the novelty of the paradigm. As Shor points out <ref> [Shor, 1994] </ref>, in addition to the complexity class NP (intuitively, the class of exponential search problems) there is the class PSPACE, which are those problems which can be solved with an amount of memory polynomial with respect to the input size, and the class BPP, which are problems which can be

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the computational power of a quantum computer can exceed that of a classical one | not in what can be computed but in the efficiency of computation. The universal TM U <ref> [Turing, 1936] </ref> is the most general possible classical computer, and all general purpose computers are approximations to it. U can simulate any Turing machine with perfect precision, where a TM in turn is a theoretical model that can simulate the execution of a single algorithm on a classical computer.
