Reference-contexts: In the case of a classifier system, if both of these rules are required to solve a particular problem, over time the GA will be unable to maintain both rules in the population stably. Elsewhere <ref> (Goldberg, 1989) </ref>, sexual differentiation has been suggested as one way to maintain marginally different genotypes in a population stably, and this may prove useful to overcome difficulty in solving classifier problems that lack separation. 5 Conclusions This extended abstract has considered the ramifications for classifier system learning of some recent results

Reference-contexts: But GAs are less swampy then they once were, and with the six pieces of the GA puzzle falling into place <ref> (Goldberg, Deb, & Clark, 1991) </ref>, not only do we better understand 1) the things GAs process (building blocks), 2) how to get enough of them, 3) how to make them grow, 4) how to permit their exchange, 5) how to make good decisions among them, and 6) what problems are tractable

Reference-contexts: The restriction to binary classification task can easily be lifted, but getting beyond stimulus-response in a pure classifier system has proved to be nontrivial. The addition of internal states and the confrontation of even the simplest sequential learning tasks presents difficult challenges to self-organizing classifier systems <ref> (Smith, 1991) </ref>. The issues dealt with here, while not orthogonal to those posed by the challenge of sequential learning, may be examined in relative isolation from that consideration.
