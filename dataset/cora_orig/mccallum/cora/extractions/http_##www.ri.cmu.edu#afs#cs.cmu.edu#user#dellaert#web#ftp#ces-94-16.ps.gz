Abstract: Technical Report Abstract We present an extension to the developmental model discussed in (Dellaert and Beer 1994) to be able to coevolve nervous systems with the bodies of autonomous agents. To this aim we reintroduce this basic model, and then examine the issues that have to be resolved when extending this model towards neural development. To test the extended model, we have handcoded a genome for a functional agent that is able to display a simple behavior related to chemotaxis. We also show that the model can be used in conjunction with genetic algorithms to yield better performing agents. Coevolving Body and Brain in Autonomous Agents using a

Reference-contexts: 1 . Introduction We are interested in using a developmental model to synthesize autonomous agents. In <ref> (Dellaert and Beer 1994) </ref> a simplified, evolvable and yet biologically defensible model of the developmental process is presented, explicitly designed with this goal in mind. However, that model only addresses the development of emerging patterns of different cell types, represented by square elements of different color. <p> The Basic Developmental Model In this section a brief overview is given of the principal components found in the basic developmental model proposed in <ref> (Dellaert and Beer 1994) </ref>. In this basic model, the developmental process unfolds simultaneously at three different levels: at the level of the organism, of the cell and at the molecular/genetic level. 2.1. The Genetic Regulatory Network The genetic regulatory network is the first principal component of the model. <p> This simple color-model only necessitated interpreting certain bits in the state vector: the only active role played by the genetic elements was (1) to regulate the state of other elements, and (2) to influence neighboring cells via the neighborhood vector <ref> (see Dellaert and Beer 1994) </ref>. Now we will provide a framework to make cellular function possible, e.g. sending out an axon or releasing a chemical agent. To that end, we have implemented the Boolean networks using a new genome-cytoplasm simulation model. <p> The intra-cellular recordings of all the neurons of the handcoded organism during the experiment of Fig.11. 6 . Evolvability of the Extended Model The next interesting question is whether we can now use the genetic algorithm to improve on the behavior of the handcoded organism. As already stressed in <ref> (Dellaert and Beer 1994) </ref>, note that mutations and crossover will take place on the level of the genome, but that we are looking to optimize a performance function in the fully developed organism, which is not a trivial problem. <p> Fig.14.

Conc lusi ons We have presented an extension to the basic developmental model discussed in <ref> (Dellaert and Beer 1994) </ref> to account for neural development, tested it by handcoding a functional agent, and we have shown that the model can be used in conjunction with genetic algorithms to yield better performing agents.

Reference-contexts: The Genetic Regulatory Network The genetic regulatory network is the first principal component of the model. The unfolding pattern of differential gene expression at the genome-level is modeled by a network of interacting genetic elements, in this case a Boolean network, as first pioneered in this context by <ref> (Kauffman 1969) </ref>. Fig.1 illustrates one possible instance of the wiring of a Boolean network with three nodes each having two inputs. Not shown but crucial to the understanding of such networks are the Boolean functions that are implemented within each node.

Reference-contexts: Modeling Neural Development In this section we focus our attention in turn to all the major phenomena that play a role in neural development. No attempt is made to explain these aspects of development at length, but instead we would like to refer the reader to <ref> (Purves and Lichtman 1985) </ref>, whose order of presenting these topics we will loosely follow here. We intend to examine what aspects are important to incorporate in the model and how we could do this. 3.1. <p> The growing axon would then sense these CAM molecules and only grow where they are laid out, in the direction where it can find more. In <ref> (Purves and Lichtman 1985) </ref> a number of other possible (coexisting?) mechanisms are discussed: we chose the one that appeals most to us and decided to model only that in the first cut.
