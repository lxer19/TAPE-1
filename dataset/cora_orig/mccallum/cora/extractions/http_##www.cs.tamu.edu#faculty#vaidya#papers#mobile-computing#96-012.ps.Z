Abstract: With the increasing popularity of portable wireless computers, mechanisms to efficiently transmit information to such clients are of significant interest. The environment under consideration is asymmetric in that the information server has much more bandwidth available, as compared to the clients. In such environments, often it is not possible (or not desirable) for the clients to send explicit requests to the server. It has been proposed that in such systems the server should broadcast the data periodically. One challenge in implementing this solution is to determine the schedule for broadcasting the data, such that the wait encountered by the clients is minimized. A broadcast schedule determines what is broadcast by the server and when. In this report, we present two algorithms for determining broadcast schedules that minimize the wait time. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that our algorithms perform well. fl Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program. grant 009741-052-C.

Reference-contexts: Approaches for determining what to transmit and when, is the subject of this report. In the environment under consideration, the downstream communication capacity from server to clients is relatively much greater than the upstream communication capacity, from clients to server. Such environments are, hence, called asymmetric communication environments <ref> [2] </ref>. In an asymmetric environment, broadcasting the information is an effective way of making the information available simultaneously to a large number of users. For asymmetric environment, researchers have previously proposed algorithms for designing broadcast schedules [1-3,5-13]. <p> It is important to minimize the access time so as to decrease the idle time at the client. Several researchers have considered the problem of minimizing the access time <ref> [5, 10, 11, 6, 3, 2, 13] </ref> * Tuning time: This is the amount ot time a client must listen to the broadcast until it receives the information it needs. <p> The existing schemes can be roughly divided into two categories (some schemes may belong to both categories, we have listed them in the most appropriate category): Schemes attempting to reduce the access time <ref> [3, 2, 1, 7, 11, 6, 5, 13] </ref> and schemes attempting to reduce the tuning time [9, 8, 10] Chiueh [5] and Acharya et al.

This observation also follows from a result presented in [11], and has been implicitly used by others (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For adaptive scheduling, this is not necessary, as a client will eventually time-out for a page whose frequency is 0, and send a request to the server. 19 much like the RAID approach spreads stripes of data on different disks <ref> [4] </ref>. This requires the clients to receive broadcasts on multiple frequencies.
