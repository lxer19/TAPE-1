Abstract: Previous work in real-time database management systems (RT-DBMS) has primarily based on simulation. This chapter discusses how current real-time technology has been applied to architect an actual RT-DBMS on a real-time microkernel operating system. A real RT-DBMS must confront many practical issues which simulations typically ignore: race conditions, concurrency, and asynchrony. The challenge of constructing a RT-DBMS is divided into three basic problems: dealing with resource contention, dealing with data contention, and enforcing timing constraints. In this chapter, we present our approaches to each problem.

Reference-contexts: Star-Base uses no a priori information about transaction workload and discards tardy transactions at their deadline points. In order to realize many of these goals, StarBase is constructed on top of RT-Mach, a real-time operating system developed at Carnegie Mellon University [11]. StarBase differs from previous RT-DBMS work <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> in that a) it relies on a real-time operating system which provides priority-based scheduling and time-based synchronization, and b) it deals explicitly with data contention and deadline handling in addition to transaction scheduling, the traditional focus of simulation studies.
