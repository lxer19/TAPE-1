Abstract: We develop and demonstrate an autonomous control synthesis system called Phase Space Navigator for nonlinear control systems, with which a global, nonlinear controller for a dynamical system can be automatically synthesized. The Phase Space Navigator intelligently plans and navigates system trajectories in phase space. It finds optimal global paths from an initial state to the goal state in the phase space, consisting of a sequence of path segments connected at intermediate points where the control parameter changes. The method relies on the knowledge of dynamics in terms of phase-space geometry. Modeling and parsing phase spaces into trajectory flow pipes provide a way to efficiently reason about the phase-space structures and search for global control paths. The Phase Space Navigator has automatically synthesized a high-quality global controller for stabilizing a maglev train.

Reference-contexts: It can also assist control engineers in exploring much larger design spaces than otherwise possible. Computational tools that employ powerful symbolic and numerical techniques and actively exploit nonlinear dynamics play increasingly important roles in the synthesis and analysis of high-performance nonlinear control systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Our method relies on the phase-space knowledge obtained from an autonomous phase-space analysis and modeling program called MAPS that extracts and represents qualitative phase-space structures characterizing the qualitative aspects of the dynamics [20].

Reference-contexts: The program uniformly samples the continuous parameter space at discrete points and then applies the algorithm on these control points. A much better approach, however, would search for "land-mark points" that delimit distinct behaviors and then partition the parameter space into equivalent subspaces. For example, the Bifurcation Interpreter <ref> [2] </ref> can be employed to search for the bifurcation points defining qualitative changes in dynamics and decompose the parameter space into topologically equivalent subparts. 4.4.4 Suboptimal control paths The algorithm finds optimal paths in the flow-pipe graph.

Reference-contexts: If the planning is done off-line, the synthesized plan is compiled into a table. At the runtime the controller performs a table lookup for a control action. On-line reference trajectory synthesis and tracking require substantial computational power. The Supercomputer Toolkit <ref> [3] </ref> provides an ideal platform for experimenting with the above control synthesis algorithm on real-time control applications.

Reference-contexts: The control u is shown in Figure 11 (d). The synthesized trajectories could be further optimized with variational techniques on the collection of trajectories within the flow-pipe segments <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.3.2 Control design II: restoring from the buckled state The column is initially near the buckled state (1:41; 0:0). The control objective here is to pull the column out of the buckled state and to bring it close to the unbuckled state.

Reference-contexts: The larger the load is, the farther away the buckled states are from the principal axis. The column breaks when the buckling exceeds certain limit. As P surpasses P critical , the column undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation of equilibria <ref> [8] </ref>: the attractor at the origin gives birth to a saddle at the origin and two attractors on two sides. 5.2 Extracting and representing qualitative phase-space structure of the buckling column MAPS automatically analyzes the column model in the phase space and extracts and represents the qualitative phase-space structure [20].

Reference-contexts: It is a small, opportunistic dynamical alteration based on the global knowledge of phase-space structures. As soon as the system enters the neighborhood of the desired state, a local linear controller stabilizes the system at the desired location. 1 Variable-structure control <ref> [10] </ref> also composes phase spaces along switching surfaces.

Reference-contexts: A trajectory segment is extracted from a flow pipe and is continuously deformed to connect intermediate points in the path. The local trajectory generator also smooths out sharp interconnections of trajectory segments to reduce undesired transients, with local linear controllers or local sliding surface insertion <ref> [16] </ref>. The noise and certain type of parametric uncertainties of the synthesized reference trajectory are modeled with a thickened trajectory, of which the thickness 6 measures the effect of perturbations.

Reference-contexts: The available control input is the coil input voltage V i in the model (4). We further assume that V i is produced by a buck converter capable of delivering any voltage from 0 to 300 volts. A linear control design for the maglev model (4) described in <ref> [18] </ref> uses the pole-placement method. The system is first linearized around the equilibrium. The linearized system has unstable poles, i.e., the poles in the right-half of s-plane. A linear feedback is introduced to move the poles to the desired locations in the left-half of the s-plane. <p> With the geometric representation of the controllable region in phase space, the Workbench precisely determined that the maximum recoverable displacement is 4.55mm. Our simulation geometrically explained the observation in <ref> [18] </ref> that the vehicle would fall off the rails with a displacement of 5mm or larger. Many issues remain to be addressed in order to make the control design practical.

Reference-contexts: This is useful as the synthesized reference trajectory often has to be modified to accommodate uncertainties and noise. 4 The Phase Space Navigator We present a general, two-stage architecture for the autonomous synthesis of nonlinear controllers in phase space <ref> [21] </ref>. The Phase Space Navigator serves as the prototype for the architecture. It has two main modules: the planning module and the tracking module. The planning module synthesizes a desired trajectory, the reference trajectory, in phase space based on the dynamics of the nominal model.
