Reference-contexts: in a Longbow discourse plan is intended when either * the effect is used to establish one of the high level goals of the plan, * it is used to establish a precondition for some step that contributes an intended effect to the plan or 1 As Bratman et al <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref> have discussed, representing an agent's intentions, their formation and their maintenance is a complex matter. I'll side-step this complexity in this discussion by focusing on intentionality as represented by the internal structure of a discourse plan.

Reference-contexts: His definition of meaning, however, deals with two concepts of immediate importance to this discussion: intention 1 and the hearer's recognition of it. Much like the central roles that intentions play in the plans that resource-bounded agents form <ref> [Bratman 1987] </ref>, intentions play similar pivotal roles in the construction of discourse plans.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, I will focus on the effects of communicative actions and their role in the satisfaction of the plan's various goals and preconditions. 2 Pollack describes overloading in the context of an agent's plans in general. See Di Eugenio and Webber <ref> [Di Eugenio and Webber 1996] </ref> for a description of overloading in a discourse context. 3 For a complete discussion, including formal definitions, see [Young et al. 1994]. * it is used to establish a goal of a subplan, where that goal is itself intended.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, the overloading of implicatures would be as straightforward as the overloading of effects in the current Longbow system. Blocking unwanted implicatures would be a matter of detecting inconsistent intentions, a task already performed by the planning algorithm. Backwards cancellation <ref> [Gazdar 1979] </ref> would be dealt with in a similar manner; in plans where backwards cancellation was undesirable (for instance, when cancellation would block an intended implicature), the planning algorithm would detect this interference using its standard techniques for finding and resolving unwanted interactions between utterances.

Reference-contexts: In both approaches, however, the representation of intention and recognition are implicit rather than explicit intention and recognition play a role in the creation of the final discourse plan but are not exploited during its construction. Green's <ref> [Green 1994] </ref> dissertation describes an approach for generating and interpreting indirect answers. Her approach to the generation of indirect answers is composed of two phases.

Reference-contexts: Thomason [Thomason 1990] argues that an essential characteristic of an implicature is that it is meant in something close to the the Gricean <ref> [Grice 1957] </ref> sense and he relates this sense of meaning to the intentions present in a speaker's discourse plan. According to him, To mean p is to intentionally reveal an intention to make p asserted through the hearer's recognition of the status of an intention or plan of the speaker's.

Reference-contexts: As Moore [Moore 1989] describes, drawing a distinction between intended effects and side effects in a discourse plan is crucial for effective replanning in the face of communicative failure. Moore and Pollack <ref> [Moore and Pollack 1992] </ref> show that distinguishing the intentional structure of a discourse from its informational structure is helpful in discourse interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Recent work in natural language generation systems has emphasized the importance of the representation of intentional structure in the discourse plans they produce. As Moore <ref> [Moore 1989] </ref> describes, drawing a distinction between intended effects and side effects in a discourse plan is crucial for effective replanning in the face of communicative failure.

Reference-contexts: as Thomason puts it, speakers "kill many conversational birds with one stone, intending at once to assert a number of propositions." Without representing the intentional role that an individual communicative act plays in a discourse, it is not clear how one would generate discourse plans containing utterances that are overloaded <ref> [Pollack 1992] </ref>, that is, containing actions that are used to establish more than one intended effect or containing intended effects that establish conditions needed by more than one subsequent utterance. 2 While previous discourse planning systems have proved useful for generating multi-sentential text, most have employed very limited representations of intention

Reference-contexts: Can the techniques used by these approaches be used to generate implicatures related to discourse content and structure? If so, what representational extensions do they require? Thomason <ref> [Thomason 1990] </ref> advocates the use of a plan-based approach to generate implicatures in discourse. As a step in this direction, he provides a definition of meaning in terms of the intentions of a speaker and the recognition of the speaker's discourse plan by the hearer. <p> Without this ability, these systems are limited in a number of ways I summarize below. 2 Intentions, Implicatures and Discourse Generation A number of authors have described central characteristics of conversational implicature (e.g., can-celability, reinforceability, non-detachability). Thomason <ref> [Thomason 1990] </ref> argues that an essential characteristic of an implicature is that it is meant in something close to the the Gricean [Grice 1957] sense and he relates this sense of meaning to the intentions present in a speaker's discourse plan.
