Title: Secure Spread Spectrum Watermarking for Multimedia  
Author: Ingemar J. Coxy, Joe Kiliany, Tom Leightonz and Talal Shamoony 
Abstract: c flNEC Research Institute, Technical Report 95 10. Abstract We describe a digital watermarking method for use in audio, image, video and multimedia data. We argue that a watermark must be placed in perceptually significant components of a signal if it is to be robust to common signal distortions and malicious attack. However, it is well known that modification of these components can lead to perceptual degradation of the signal. To avoid this, we propose to insert a watermark into the spectral components of the data using techniques analogous to spread sprectrum communications, hiding a narrow band signal in a wideband channel that is the data. The watermark is difficult for an attacker to remove, even when several individuals conspire together with independently watermarked copies of the data. It is also robust to common signal and geometric distortions such as digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, resampling, and requantization, including dithering and recompression and rotation, translation, cropping and scaling. The same digital watermarking algorithm can be applied to all three media under consideration with only minor modifications, making it especially appropriate for multimedia products. Retrieval of the watermark unambiguously identifies the owner, and the watermark can be constructed to make counterfeiting almost impossible. Experimental results are presented to support these claims.

Reference-contexts: However, the resulting DCT has no relationship to that of the true image and consequently may be likely to cause noticeable artifacts in the image and be sensitive to noise. In addition to direct work on watermarking images, there are several works of interest in related areas. Adelson <ref> [Ade90] </ref> describes a technique for embedding digital information in an analog signal for the purpose of inserting digital data into an analog TV signal.

Reference-contexts: Since it relies on modifications of the least significant bits, the watermark is easily destroyed. Further, their method is restricted to images, in that it seeks to insert the watermark into image regions that lie on the edge of contours. Bender at al <ref> [BGM95] </ref> describe two watermarking schemes. The first is a statistical method called "Patchwork" that somewhat resembles the statistical component of our proposal.

Reference-contexts: The fainter such watermarks are the more susceptible they are such attacks and geometric shapes provide only a limited alphabet with which to encode information. Moreover, the scheme is not applicable to audio data and may not be robust to common geometric distortions, especially cropping. Brassil et al <ref> [BLMO94] </ref> propose three methods appropriate for document images in which text is common. Digital watermarks are coded by: (1) vertically shifting text lines, (2) horizontally shifting words, or (3) altering text features such as the vertical endlines of individual characters.

Reference-contexts: We note that most schemes proposed seem quite vulnerable to such attacks. As a theoretical exception, Boneh and Shaw <ref> [BS95] </ref> propose a coding scheme for use in situations in which one can insert many relatively weak 0=1 watermarks into a document. They assume that if the ith watermark is the same for all t copies of the document then it cannot be detected, changed or removed. <p> With t documents one can, on average, eliminate all but a 2 1t fraction of the components of the watermark. Note that this attack does not assume anything about the distribution on v i . While a more intelligent allocation of 1 values to the watermarks (following <ref> [LM93, BS95] </ref>) will better resist this simple attack, the discrete nature of the watermark components makes them much easier to completely eliminate. Our use of continuous valued watermarks appears to give greater resilience to such attacks.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, Turner's method may easily be circumvented. For example, if it is known that the algorithm only affects the least significant two bits of a word, then it is possible to randomly flip all such bits, thereby destroying any existing identification code. Caronni <ref> [Car95] </ref> suggests adding tags | small geometric patterns to digitized images at brightness levels that are imperceptable. While the idea of hiding a spatial watermark in an image is fundamentally sound, this scheme is susceptible to attack by filtering and redigitization. <p> Cropping, or the cutting out and removal of portions of an image, also leads to irretrievable loss of data. Cropping may be a serious threat to any spatially based watermark such as <ref> [Car95] </ref> but is less likely to affect a frequency-based scheme, as shown in Section 5.5. Common signal distortions include digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, resampling, re-quantization, including dithering and recompression, and common signal enhancements to image contrast and/or color, and audio frequency equalization.

Reference-contexts: However, the fact that the original image is known allows many signal transformations to be undone, at least approximately. For example, histogram equalization, a common non-linear contrast enhancement method, may be removed substantially by histogram specification [GW93] or dynamic histogram warping <ref> [CRH95] </ref> techniques. Finally, the copied image may not remain in digital form. Instead, it is likely to be printed, or an analog recording made (onto analog audio or video tape). These reproductions introduce additional degradation into the image that a watermarking scheme must be robust to.

Reference-contexts: Geometric distortions are specific to images and video, and include such operations as rotation, translation, scaling and cropping. By manually determining a minimum of four or nine corresponding points between the original and the distorted watermark, it is possible to remove any two or three dimensional affine transformation <ref> [Fau93] </ref>. However, an affine scaling (shrinking) of the image leads to a loss of data in the high frequency spectral regions of the image. Cropping, or the cutting out and removal of portions of an image, also leads to irretrievable loss of data.

Reference-contexts: In digital waveform coding, this frequency domain (and, in some cases, time/pixel domain) masking is exploited extensively to achieve low bit rate encoding of data <ref> [JJS93, GG92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Other robust statistical techniques could also be used to suppress outlier effects <ref> [Hub81] </ref>. A natural question is whether such postprocessing steps run the risk of generating false positives. Indeed, the same potential risk occurs whenever there is any latitude in the procedure for extracting X fl from D fl .

Reference-contexts: The Digimarc method does not make use of perceptual relevance and is probably equivalent to adding high frequency noise to the image. As such, it may not be robust to low pass filtering. Koch, Rindfrey and Zhao <ref> [KRZ94] </ref> propose two general methods for watermarking images. The first method, attributed to Scott Burgett, breaks up an image into 8 fi 8 blocks and computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of each of these blocks.

Reference-contexts: By comparison, we demonstrate that our method performs well with compression quality factors as low as 5%. An earlier proposal by Koch and Zhao <ref> [KZ95] </ref> used not triples of frequencies but pairs of frequencies, and was again designed specifically for robustness to JPEG compression. Nevertheless, they state that " a lower quality factor will increase the likelihood that the changes necessary to superimpose the embedded code on the signal will be noticeably 6 visible".

Reference-contexts: This is why the watermark is robust. In principle, any frequency domain transform can be used. However, for the experimental results of Section 5 we use a Fourier domain method based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) <ref> [Lim90] </ref>, although we are currently exploring the use of wavelet-based schemes as a variation. In our view, each coefficient in the frequency domain has a perceptual capacity, that is, a quantity of additional information can be added without any (or with minimal) impact to the perceptual fidelity of the data.

Reference-contexts: With t documents one can, on average, eliminate all but a 2 1t fraction of the components of the watermark.

Reference-contexts: While being compatible with existing transform coders, this scheme is quite susceptible to requantization and filtering and is equivalent to coding the watermark in the least significant bits of the transform coefficients. In a recent paper, Macq and Quisquater <ref> [MQ95] </ref> briefly discuss the issue of watermarking digital images as part of a general survey on cryptography and digital television. The authors provide a description of a procedure to insert a watermark into the least significant bits of pixels located in the vicinity of image contours.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, all three proposals are easily defeated, as discussed by the authors. Moreover, these techniques are restricted exclusively to images containing text.

Reference-contexts: While we use this methodology to hide watermarks in data, the same rationale can be applied to sending any type of message through media data. Rather than encode the watermark into the least significant components of the data, we originally conceived our approach by analogy to spread spectrum communications <ref> [PSM82] </ref>. In spread spectrum communications, one transmits a narrowband signal over a much larger bandwidth such that the signal energy present in any single frequency is imperceptible.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear that this approach would demonstrate enhanced resilience to noise. Furthermore, like all such least significant bit schemes, an attacker can eliminate the watermark by randomization. Schreiber et al <ref> [SLAN91] </ref> describe a method to interleave a standard NTSC signal within an enhanced definition television (EDTV) signal. This is accomplished by analyzing the frequency spectrum of the EDTV signal (larger than that of the NTSC signal) and decomposing it into three sub-bands (L,M,H for low, medium and high frequency respectively).
