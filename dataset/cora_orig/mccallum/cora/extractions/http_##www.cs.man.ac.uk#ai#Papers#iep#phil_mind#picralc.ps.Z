Abstract: In this paper I wish to examine an argument that has come to command wide acceptance within the contemporary philosophical community. So plausible has this argument seemed that it has sometimes served as a foundation for quite amazingly counterintuitive claims. I hope to show that the argument is flawed, and thus save us from the counterintuitive claims. Here is the argument. Whenever we describe someone as being in a certain state of mind|as doubting, perceiving, affirming, denying, willing, not willing various things|our description has this curious property: it implies, in the first instance, not how that state of mind will change, but, rather, how it ought to change. We can say of a student pondering a mathematics problem what solution he ought to arrive at, because we can say whether the proposition he is trying to establish really does follow from the axioms he is assuming. Or we can say of a detective engaged on a murder hunt which of his suspects he should regard as the most likely culprit, because we can say whether the detective's evidence confirms|according to our chosen inductive method|the proposition that this or that individual is guilty. But whether we think the student or the detective will actually arrive at the proper conclusions is another and less certain matter, one which depends on our crediting them with the propensity to reason as they ought. More generally, we can say of a person characterised in psychological terms how he ought to reason, by tracing the logical (or confirmation-theoretic) interrelations between the contents of the propositional attitudes|beliefs, desires, intentions and so forth|attributed to him. Thus, propositional attitude
