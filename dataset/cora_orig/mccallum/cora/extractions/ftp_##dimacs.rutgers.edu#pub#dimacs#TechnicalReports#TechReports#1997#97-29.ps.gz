Reference-contexts: The main reason of this phenomenon originates from the fact, that the weak chromatic number is vertex Lipschitz (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, Ch. 7, for relevant definitions and discussion). This means that if two hypergraphs H; H 0 with the same vertex set differ only in the edges containing some particular vertex v, then their weak chromatic numbers differ by at most one. <p> Also, the event A e is completely independent of all other events A e 0 , but those for which e " e 0 6= ;. The number of such events is at most M fl =4. Then, applying the symmetric version of the Lovasz Local Lemma (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, Ch. 5), we get: P [ e2E (H (U 0 )) A e ] &gt; 0, thus ensuring the existence of a desired coloring. 2 Claim 4.5 With probability 1 o (1=n) in H r (n; p) the following holds: for every integer s n=d fl and every subset W <p> r (n; p), and setting X 0 = EX we have jX i X i1 j 1 for i = 1; : : : ; n=z: Furthermore, the sequence X 0 ; : : : ; X n=z is a martingale, hence from the martingale inequality of Azuma (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>, Ch. 7), we get P rfjX EXj tg 2 exp zt 2 ! so ( n ) n ! Thus to prove Lemma 5.2, it is enough to show that the probability that H r (n; p) contains a n log 5 d=k colorable, V-disjoint subset with more than n <p> Define Y (H r (n; p)) to be the minimal size of a set of vertices S, such that H [V nS] can be colored by w = r log d 1 + log d r1 colors. Then Y is a random variable that satisfies the Lipschitz condition (see <ref> [1] </ref>, Ch. 7 for more details). Denote E (Y ) = and apply the vertex exposure martingale on H r (n; p). Then by Azuma's inequality P r Y n 1 &lt; e 2 =2 ; p Let satisfy e 2 =2 = n 2 .

Reference-contexts: A hypergraph H = (V; E) is r-uniform if all edges of H are of size r. In this paper we consider only r-uniform hypergraphs. Our terminology follows that of <ref> [2] </ref>.
Reference: [3] <author> B. Bollobas, </author> <title> The chromatic number of random graphs, </title> <booktitle> Combinatorica 8 (1988), </booktitle> <pages> 49-55. </pages>
Reference-contexts: This paper is devoted to the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the chromatic numbers of a random hypergraph. For the case of random graphs (r = 2), this problem has been studied intensively during the last twenty years and finally has been completely solved by Bollobas <ref> [3] </ref> for the case of dense graphs and by Luczak [5] for all remaining values of probability. The key ingredient of both proofs was the use of martingales. However, for every r 3 and for every value of fl the situation was far from being clear.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for r = 2 this model reduces to the well known and thoroughly studied model G (n; p) of random graphs. The reader is referred to the paper of Karonski and Luczak <ref> [4] </ref> for additional information and survey of the state of the art in random hypergraphs. In this paper we study some asymptotic properties of H r (n; p), that is, we think of n as tending to infinity while r is kept fixed. <p> For other values of p the problem remains unsolved. Moreover, even the asymptotic behavior of the fl-independence number was not known for these values of p. More details can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. The main result of this paper is the following theorem.

The key ingredient of both proofs was the use of martingales. However, for every r 3 and for every value of fl the situation was far from being clear. Only partial results have been known so far. <p> Note that for r = 2 the above theorem essentially coincides with the theorem of Luczak <ref> [5] </ref>. It is worth mentioning here that we do not make any attempt to optimize an error term in the upper bound for fl (H r (n; p)). <p> 6 we prove Theorem 1 for fl &lt; r 1. 1 An event E n holds almost surely (a.s.) in H r (n; p) if the probability of E n tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. - 3 - Based on the results of Shamir [9] and Luczak <ref> [5] </ref>, we may assume that r 3 and that (n r1 p) 1=fl n 1* for some * &gt; 0. Throughout the paper, we omit occasionally the floor and ceiling signs for the sake of convenience. All logarithms are natural. We use the following notation. <p> This makes the situation in this case very similar to that in the random graph G (n; p), thus enabling the use of martingales and the application of the main ideas of the proof of Luczak <ref> [5] </ref>. However, for every fl &lt; r 1 the corresponding chromatic number ceases to be vertex Lipschitz. Therefore, we need to develop a different approach to tackle this case. Fortunately, one can use the upper bound for the weak chromatic number to cope with this task. <p> Our argument is essentially an adaptation of the proof of Luczak <ref> [5] </ref>, with minor changes incorporated. <p> 0) EY 2 4 exp @ 7mk 0 2 n A 5 exp @ 7n log r1 d k 0 m ! 2 A exp n log 7:5 d : This completes the proof of Lemma 5.2. 2 The next lemma and its proof are shaped after Lemma 2 of <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Only partial results have been known so far. Schmidt, Shamir and Upfal in [8] considered the weak chromatic number and obtained lower and upper bounds which differ by a factor of two. Schmidt <ref> [7] </ref> treated the case of a general fl and got lower and upper bounds whose ratio is bounded by an absolute constant, thus establishing the asymptotic order of magnitude of the fl-chromatic - 2 - number. <p> This bound is easily obtained by computing the first moment of an appropriate random variable. We cite it from Lemma 6.3 of <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Schmidt [7] treated the case of a general fl and got lower and upper bounds whose ratio is bounded by an absolute constant, thus establishing the asymptotic order of magnitude of the fl-chromatic - 2 - number. Finally, Shamir <ref> [9] </ref>, again using martingale techniques, found the asymptotic value of the fl-chromatic number for the dense case (that is, when (n r1 p) 1=fl n 1* for some fixed * &gt; 0). For other values of p the problem remains unsolved. <p> Finally, in Section 6 we prove Theorem 1 for fl &lt; r 1. 1 An event E n holds almost surely (a.s.) in H r (n; p) if the probability of E n tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. - 3 - Based on the results of Shamir <ref> [9] </ref> and Luczak [5], we may assume that r 3 and that (n r1 p) 1=fl n 1* for some * &gt; 0.
