Title: A sufficient condition for a semicomplete multipartite digraph to be Hamiltonian  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Gregory Gutin and Jing Huang 
Abstract: A multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete k-partite graph for some k 2. A factor of a digraph D is a collection of vertex disjoint cycles covering all the vertices of D. We show that there is no degree of strong connectivity which together with the existence of a factor will guarantee that a multipartite tournament is Hamiltonian. Our main result is a sufficient condition for a multipartite tournament to be Hamiltonian. We show that this condition is general enough to provide easy proofs of many existing results on paths and cycles in multipartite tournaments. Using this condition, we obtain a best possible lower bound on the length of a longest cycle in any strongly connected multipartite tournament.

Reference-contexts: Using P we reduce the number of cycles and repeat the last step. The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the time it takes to check the existence of F . 2 In <ref> [1] </ref> it was shown that for general multipartite tournaments there is a polynomial algorithm to decide the existence of a cycle through any special pair of vertices. The case of k given vertices k 3 remains open. Corollary 6.3 Every kconnected ordinary multipartite tournament D is kcyclic.

Reference-contexts: Special cases of multipartite tournaments are tournaments, where k = n, the number of vertices, and bipartite tournaments, where k = 2. Bipartite tournaments have been studied intensively in the pursuit for tournament-like properties. Many properties have been shown to extend to bipartite tournaments, see e.g. <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. Even for bipartite tournaments, strong connectivity is not sufficient to guarantee a Hamiltonian cycle. In fact, there is no s such that every sconnected bipartite tournament has a Hamiltonian path [12].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we shall consider a well-known generalization of tournaments, multipartite tournaments. A multipartite tournament <ref> [4, 14] </ref> is a an orientation of a complete kpartite graph, for some k 2. Special cases of multipartite tournaments are tournaments, where k = n, the number of vertices, and bipartite tournaments, where k = 2. Bipartite tournaments have been studied intensively in the pursuit for tournament-like properties.

Since there are no appropriate sufficient and necessary conditions yet, the main result, Theorem 4.4, is fairly useful from theoretical point of view.
