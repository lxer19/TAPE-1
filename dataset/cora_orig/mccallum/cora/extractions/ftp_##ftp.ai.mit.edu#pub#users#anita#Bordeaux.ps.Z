Abstract: Surgical procedures have changed radically over the last few years due to the arrival of new technology. What will technology bring us in the future? This paper examines a few of the forces whose timing are causing new 1 ideas to congeal from the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, micromachining and smart materials. In this paper we relate our recent efforts to fabricate piezoelectric micromotors in an effort to develop actuator technologies where brawn matches to the scale of the brain. We discuss our experiments with thin film ferroelectric motors 2 mm in diameter and larger 8 mm versions machined from bulk ceramic and sketch possible applications in the surgical field.
