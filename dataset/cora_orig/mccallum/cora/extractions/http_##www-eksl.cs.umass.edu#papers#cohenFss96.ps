Abstract: Recent developments in philosophy, linguistics, developmental psychology and artificial intelligence make it possible to envision a developmental path for an artificial agent, grounded in activity-based sensorimotor representations. This paper describes how Neo, an artificial agent, learns concepts by interacting with its simulated environment. Relatively little prior structure is required to learn fairly accurate representations of objects, activities, locations and other aspects of Neo's experience. We show how classes (categories) can be abstracted from these representations.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Our goal is to build a baby, or rather, an artificial agent who lives in a simulated environment and who eventually learns to think like a three year old. A virtual infant, if you like. The abilities we want our agent, which we call Neo (nee "Baby" <ref> (Cohen et al. 1995) </ref>), to develop include learning, planning, language, an organized memory containing structured knowledge, attention, emotion and consciousness. <p> Central to these abilities is a conceptual structure, an ontology, a way to "carve the world at its joints." Given a conceptual structure, we can see a developmental path to more advanced thought, including emotion and consciousness <ref> (Cohen et al. 1995) </ref>. As Neo develops, we expect to learn much about the nature of accessible representations, the functions of categories, and the representation and roles of goals. We will elucidate the relationship between activity, attention, memory and learning.

Reference-contexts: In any case, Lakoff and Johnson make a convincing case that adult conceptual structures are grounded in primitive interactional knowledge that could very well be acquired by infants. Thus, in contrast with Piaget's theory of developmental stages <ref> (Ginsberg & Opper 1988) </ref>, we can now envision a continuous developmental trajectory|for conceptual knowledge, at least|beginning with simple, interactional primitives in infancy and becoming more elaborate through abstraction and metaphorical extension as the agent develops (Lakoff & Johnson 1980).

Indeed, Mandler's work, to which we owe much, outlines such a developmental trajectory and the empirical evidence for it (Mandler 1988; 1992). <p> We may form a class of things that Neo can grab and mouth. The chains don't say exactly which objects are in the class, but we know they are either wood or plastic, and they are graspable, and mouthable. Classes Note that "graspable" and "mouthable" are interactional properties <ref> (Lakoff & Johnson 1980) </ref> that characterize Neo's activities in its environment. Unlike "texture"|wood or plastic|they are fundamentally subjective. What's graspable by one agent isn't necessarily graspable by another.

Reference-contexts: We hope to demonstrate that an agent can develop sophisticated knowledge from minimal beginnings. The goal of this paper is more modest, however: to show that Neo can acquire concepts and categories from interacting with its environment. Categorization, as Lakoff points out, is central to human thought <ref> (Lakoff 1984) </ref>. It is also central to Lakoff and Johnson's challenge to Objectivism (Johnson 1987; Lakoff & Johnson 1980; Lakoff 1984), the dominant view in Western philosophy that there is an objective way to represent the world and reason about it.
