Reference-contexts: In contrast to graph isomor-phism, in fact, the problem of finding just the cardinality of the maximum clique in a graph is known to be N P -complete and, according to recent theoretical results, so is the problem of approximating it within a certain tolerance <ref> [1, 6, 18] </ref>. 1 The experimental results presented in this paper, however, seem to contradict this claim.

Reference-contexts: It is often said that random graph isomorphism is trivial. Essentially, this claim is based on a result due to Babai et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> which shows that a straightforward, linear-time graph isomorphism algorithm does work for almost all random graphs. 5 It should be pointed out, however, that there are various probability models for random graphs [32]. <p> Now, the results presented in <ref> [2] </ref> are based on the observation that, using a uniform probability model, the degrees of the vertices have large variability and this is in fact the key to their algorithm.

The graph isomorphism problem is therefore to decide whether two graphs are isomorphic and, in the affirmative, to find an isomorphism.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, while clearly belonging to N P , no proof has been provided that it is N P -complete. Indeed, there is strong evidence that this cannot be the case for, otherwise, the polynomial hierarchy would collapse <ref> [7, 43] </ref>. The current belief is that the problem lies strictly between the P and N P -complete classes. Because of its theoretical as well as practical importance, the problem has attracted much attention in the neural network community, and various powerful heuristics have been developed [25, 40, 41, 44].

Reference-contexts: Central to our approach is a powerful result originally proved by Motzkin and Straus [31], and recently extended in various ways <ref> [8, 16, 17, 37] </ref>, which allows us to formulate the maximum clique problem in terms of an indefinite quadratic program. <p> In principle, spurious solutions represent a problem since, while providing information about the order of the maximum clique, do not allow us to easily extract its vertices. Fortunately, there is straightforward solution to this problem which has recently been introduced and studied by Bomze <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> The following is the spurious-free counterpart of the original Motzkin-Straus theorem (see <ref> [8] </ref> for proof).

Previous experimental work done on the maximum clique problem <ref> [10, 35] </ref>, and also the results presented in this paper, however, suggest that the basins of attraction of global maximizers are quite large, and very frequently the algorithm converges to one of them. <p> A similar observation was also made in connection to earlier experiments concerning the maximum clique problem <ref> [10, 35] </ref>. 4 Faster replicator dynamics Recently, there has been much interest in evolutionary game theory around the following exponential version of replicator equations, which arises as a model of evolution guided by imitation [19, 21, 46, 47]: _x i (t) = x i (t) e i (t) j=1 x j

Reference-contexts: In population ecology, for example, the famous Lotka-Volterra equations for predator-prey sys tems turn out to be equivalent to the continuous-time dynamics (7), under a simple barycentric transformation and a change in velocity. In population genetics they are known as selection equations (see, e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>). In this case, each x i represents the frequency of the i-th allele A i 9 and the payoff w ij is the "fitness" of genotype A i A j . Here the fitness matrix W is always symmetric. <p> Furthermore, any such trajectory converges to a (unique) stationary point. The previous result is known in mathematical biology as the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection <ref> [12, 20, 47] </ref> and, in its original form, traces back to Fisher [13]. As far as the discrete-time model is concerned, it can be regarded as a straightforward implication of the more general Baum-Eagon theorem [4, 5].

A similar relationship holds between (strict) local maximizers and maximal cliques <ref> [17, 37] </ref>. This result has an intriguing computational significance in that it allows us to shift from the discrete to the continuous domain in an elegant manner. The advantages of such a reformulation are manyfold.

After discussing various properties of payoff monotonic dynamics, Hofbauer [19] has recently concluded that they behave essentially in the same way as the standard replicator equations, the only difference being the size of the basins of attraction around stable equilibria. <p> Moreover, when the fitness matrix W is symmetric, the average population payoff defined in (10) is also strictly increasing, as in the first-order case (see <ref> [19] </ref> for proof).

In this paper, we develop a new energy-minimization framework for the graph isomorphism 1 problem which is based on the idea of reducing it to the maximum clique problem, another well-known combinatorial optimization problem [34].

Reference-contexts: This kind of conflict is modeled as a game, the players being pairs of randomly selected population members. In contrast to traditional application fields of game theory, such as economics or sociology (see, e.g., <ref> [28] </ref>), players here do not behave "rationally," but act instead according to a "pre-programmed" behavior pattern, or pure strategy. Reproduction is assumed to be asexual, which means that, apart from mutation, offsprings will inherit the same genetic material, and hence behavioral phenotype, as its parent.

A similar relationship holds between (strict) local maximizers and maximal cliques <ref> [17, 37] </ref>. This result has an intriguing computational significance in that it allows us to shift from the discrete to the continuous domain in an elegant manner.

Reference-contexts: In this section we discuss the basic intuition behind replicator equations and present a few theoretical properties that will be instrumental in the subsequent development of our graph isomorphism algorithm. For a more systematic treatment see, e.g., <ref> [20, 47] </ref>. Consider a large population of individuals belonging to the same species which compete for a particular limited resource, such as food, territory, etc. This kind of conflict is modeled as a game, the players being pairs of randomly selected population members. <p> Furthermore, any such trajectory converges to a (unique) stationary point. The previous result is known in mathematical biology as the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection <ref> [12, 20, 47] </ref> and, in its original form, traces back to Fisher [13]. As far as the discrete-time model is concerned, it can be regarded as a straightforward implication of the more general Baum-Eagon theorem [4, 5]. <p> A similar observation was also made in connection to earlier experiments concerning the maximum clique problem [10, 35]. 4 Faster replicator dynamics Recently, there has been much interest in evolutionary game theory around the following exponential version of replicator equations, which arises as a model of evolution guided by imitation <ref> [19, 21, 46, 47] </ref>: _x i (t) = x i (t) e i (t) j=1 x j (t)e j (t) 1 ; i = 1 : : : n (11) where is a positive constant. <p> As tends to 0, the orbits of this dynamics approach those of the standard, "first-order" replicator model (7), slowed down by the factor ; moreover, for large values of the model approximates the so-called "best-reply" dynamics [21]. It is readily seen that dynamics (11) is payoff monotonic <ref> [47] </ref>, which means that _x i (t) &gt; x j (t) for i; j = 1 : : : n. This amounts to stating that during the evolution process the components corresponding to higher payoffs will increase at higher rate. <p> This amounts to stating that during the evolution process the components corresponding to higher payoffs will increase at higher rate. Observe that the first-order replicator model (7) also is payoff monotonic. The class of payoff monotonic dynamics possesses several interesting properties <ref> [47] </ref>. In particular, they all have the same set of stationary points, which are characterized by (9). Moreover, when the fitness matrix W is symmetric, the average population payoff defined in (10) is also strictly increasing, as in the first-order case (see [19] for proof).
