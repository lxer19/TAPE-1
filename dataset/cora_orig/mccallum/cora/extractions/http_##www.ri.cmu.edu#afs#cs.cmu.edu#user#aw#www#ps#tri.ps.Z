Abstract: We present an approach to modeling with truly mutable yet completely controllable free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology. Surfaces may be pinned down at points and along curves, cut up and smoothly welded back together, and faired and reshaped in the large. This style of control is formulated as a constrained shape optimization, with minimization of squared principal curvatures yielding graceful shapes that are free of the parameterization worries accompanying many patch-based approaches. Triangulated point sets are used to approximate these smooth variational surfaces, bridging the gap between patch-based and particle-based representations. Automatic refinement, mesh smoothing, and re-triangulation maintain a good computational mesh as the surface shape evolves, and give sample points and surface features much of the freedom to slide around in the surface that oriented particles enjoy. The resulting surface triangulations are constructed and maintained in real time.

Reference-contexts: Worse, even though a node may have five neighbors they may be positioned para metrically so as to make the full biquadratic fit ill-conditioned. In this case, a reduced polynomial basis function is used. For each node (of sufficient degree), an initial fit of the full basis <ref> [1; u; v; 1 2 2 v ] </ref> is attempted. The condition number of this fit, c = kS Sk k (S S) k, is then computed (where the matrix norms are Frobenius norms [14]). <p> If the fit was ill-conditioned (say, c &gt; 1000), or if there were too few neighbors, a fit is attempted with the reduced basis functions <ref> [1; u; v; 1 2 (u 2 + v 2 )] </ref> for interior nodes 3 . <p> Boundary nodes, which will rarely have enough neighbors for a full fit, are treated specially: the parameterization is constructed so that the two boundary nodes lie on the u axis, and the basis functions <ref> [1; u; v; 1 2 u 2 ] </ref> are used. This lets a surface curve along its boundary while remaining flat in the infield direction. As before, the condition number is evaluated and an ill-conditioned fit rejected. <p> This lets a surface curve along its boundary while remaining flat in the infield direction. As before, the condition number is evaluated and an ill-conditioned fit rejected. As a last resort, a planar fit (for boundary or infield nodes) is made with the basis functions <ref> [1; u; v] </ref>. A shortcoming of this approach is that the somewhat arbitrary choice of basis functions could lead to instability over time (though we have not observed this, a neighborhood that is nearly well-conditioned might switch back and forth between different sets of basis functions). <p> Better would be to consistently use the same set of basis functions and optimize some auxiliary norm in the underde-termined case, as in Barth <ref> [1] </ref>. This requires an orthogonal decom position of S T S, an added computational expense that degrades the overall interactivity of the modeler. 3.3 Curve reconstruction Smooth neighborhoods for PWL curve approximations are computed analogously to the fitting procedure for surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Little work has appeared regarding topological design for freeform shapes (though see <ref> [10] </ref>). Our approach uses a triangulated mesh to represent a surface model's topology, and interactive modeling operations alter the mesh to change this topology in controlled ways.

Reference-contexts: Note that this treats the surface as if it were a (non-smooth) union of quadratic bowls, over which samples are sliding. As it happens, this method is closely related to a "mesh improvement" scheme called Laplacian smoothing <ref> [11] </ref>, so named because its fixed point is an approximate solution to Laplace's equation over the mesh. In fact, Laplace's equation is ubiquitous in computational mesh generation [36,37], arising naturally from a variational formulation of a uniform-density objective. <p> Surface features like bounded sub-regions and embedded curves will be free to slide around relative to each other within the surface triangulation (e.g., the final frame in Field <ref> [11] </ref> has shown that combining a Laplacian neighborhood smoothing scheme and Delaunay triangulation (DT) tends to produce nice triangulations.

Reference-contexts: Algebraic methods have the added drawback that they do not allow us to incorporate topological constraints like radial neighbor ordering into the fit. Instead, following a standard approach to constructing finite difference stencils over a computational field <ref> [12] </ref>, we will fit a truncated Taylor series expansion at a neighborhood around a point. This approach yields the desired linearity, but it comes at the expense of having to construct a separate bivariate parameterization over which to evaluate the polynomial basis functions.

Worse, even though a node may have five neighbors they may be positioned para metrically so as to make the full biquadratic fit ill-conditioned.

Reference-contexts: Lott and Pullin <ref> [20] </ref> used this for surface fairing because of its relationship to the strain energy of a thin elastic plate.

Reference-contexts: This has not been a problem in our interactive system because changes to shape are generally incremental. There are configura tions in which curvature minimization is undesirable as an objective function, as with narrow cylinders (which collapse). A minimum curvature variation functional, as in Moreton and Sequin <ref> [22] </ref>, would remedy this problem; but it is not clear how to compute the curvature derivatives given our local quadratic reconstructions, and we leave this as future work. 5 Surface sampling Taking the view that a mesh is a discrete sampling of some smooth underlying surface, it is important that the

Reference-contexts: This generality is what makes representing and controlling such shapes on a computer a difficult problem. 1.1 Functional minimization for shape design Optimization has long been used as a way of describing fair freeform shapes (a good survey is Moreton <ref> [23] </ref>). More recently, it has come to be used in interactive modelers [4,5,41,18]. Though such approaches are computationally complex, their intent is to create an illusion of simplicity for the designer. Ideally, the designer sees a surface having no particular fixed controls or other representation-specific parameters.

Reference-contexts: Such shapes can thus be unambiguously specified and controlled through direct manipulation, regardless of the coarseness of their explicit approximations. If an explicit smooth surface is needed for any reason, it is a straightforward task to fit one to the triangulated surface in a post-processing step <ref> [24] </ref>. 1.3 Outline of this paper After a brief overview of our approach to variational sculpting and its underlying machinery, the bulk of the paper (sections 3-5) develops the mathematics and algorithms needed to construct approximations to these variational surfaces.

Reference-contexts: We'll make the most of this by constructing the parameterization in such a way that it gives the fairing functional (Section 4) a particularly simple form. 3.1 Neighborhood parameterizations Much of the theory of curves and surfaces is developed in terms of curves parameterized by arc-length <ref> [25] </ref>. Geometric quantities, such as curvature, have simple expressions with respect an arc-length parameterization. <p> For surfaces, there is no corresponding notion of an arc-length parameterization; but there is a construction from differential geometry, the geodesic polar map <ref> [25] </ref>, which serves our needs in much the same way.

Lott and Pullin [20] used this for surface fairing because of its relationship to the strain energy of a thin elastic plate.

One approach that has been used successfully for both smooth and polyhedral surfaces is point repulsion <ref> [29, 38,39,42] </ref>: points move under the influence of mutual repulsive (or attractive) forces between points, constrained to act within the surface. In these schemes, a pair of points' influence on each other falls off as an inverse power of their separation.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these approaches have only allowed a designer to interact with pre-fabricated families of shapes, in which the topology remains fixed and surfaces do not stray far from their initial configurations.

Further, no real consideration has been given to the problem of creating nontrivial smooth surface topologies interactively.

Reference-contexts: Curve correspondence: To merge two surfaces along a pair of boundaries, or skin two boundary curves with a single sheet, the nodes on the two curves must first be put into correspondence. In general, something like Sederberg's scheme <ref> [31] </ref> might be used to robustly determine this correspondence. A simpler (though by no means fail-safe) procedure is to iteratively refine the curve with fewer edges by splitting its longest edge until both curves have the same number of nodes.
