Title: Multicategory Discrimination via Linear Programming  
Author: Kristin P. Bennett O. L. Mangasarian 
Date: November 30, 1992  
Abstract: A single linear program is proposed for discriminating between the elements of k disjoint point sets in the n-dimensional real space R n : When the conical hulls of the k sets are (k 1)-point disjoint in R n+1 , a k-piece piecewise-linear surface generated by the linear program completely separates the k sets. This improves on a previous linear programming approach which required that each set be linearly separable from the remaining k 1 sets. When the conical hulls of the k sets are not (k 1)-point disjoint, the proposed linear program generates an error-minimizing piecewise-linear separator for the k sets. For this case it is shown that the null solution is never a unique solver of the linear program and occurs only under the rather rare condition when the mean of each point set equals the mean of the means of the other k 1 sets. This makes the proposed linear computational programming formulation useful for approximately discriminating between k sets that are not piecewise-linear separable. Computational results are reported for three previously available databases.

The Italian wine cultivar database is piecewise-linear separable. A single linear program was able to correctly separate the training set. The testing set performance was comparable to previously published results <ref> [1] </ref>. Fisher's classical iris discrimination problem is almost piecewise-linear separable and once again the multicategory linear programming approach performed quite well on both the training and testing sets. These problems illustrate that a single multicategory linear program can effectively discriminate sets that are totally (or almost totally) piecewise-linear separable.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the sets are not piecewise-linear separable is evidenced by the relatively poor training set accuracy shown in Table 1.

To demonstrate this, we used the multicategory linear program to create the multivariate splits in the multisurface method tree algorithm (MSMT) [2, 18].

The resulting piecewise-linear surface divides the space into k regions. <p> A single linear program is insufficient for solving such problems.
