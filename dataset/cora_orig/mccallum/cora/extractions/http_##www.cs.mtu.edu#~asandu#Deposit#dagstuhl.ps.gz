Abstract: In this paper the present "state" of air quality modeling (as viewed by the authors) is presented. The focus of the paper will be on the "current" state-of-affairs. Due to limitation of space (and the focus of this Dagstuhl Seminar) the discussion will focus on only a few aspects of air quality modeling: i.e., chemical integration, sensitivity analisys and computational framework.

Reference-contexts: Most sensitivity analysis applied to air pollution modeling studies has been focused on the calculation of the local sensitivities (first order derivatives of output variables with respect to model parameters) in box model studies of gas phase chemistry (see <ref> [7] </ref>). The most common form of sensitivity studies with comprehensive atmospheric chemistry/transport models has been the so-called "brute force" method, i.e., a number of input parameters are selected to be varied and the simulation results are then compared. This method becomes less viable as the model becomes more comprehensive. <p> This method becomes less viable as the model becomes more comprehensive. A variety of alternative techniques are available including Green's function analysis (see <ref> [7] </ref>), adjoint models and several variations of the direct decoupled methods (see [11]). A recently developed technique for sensitivity study is automatic differentiation technology. Automatic differentiation is implemented by pre-compilers that analyze the code for evaluating a function of several variables and add instructions needed to compute the required derivatives. <p> sensitivity coefficients over the selected time horizon: L (ff j ) = t 2 t 1 Z t 2 L (ff j ) dt (9) If the mean sensitivities: S j = N are far less then one, the system is considered stable with respect to the initial conditions (see <ref> [7] </ref>). A powerful aspect of the use of ADIFOR is that it is readily applied to combined transport/chemistry problems 6 SUMMARY Air quality models will continue to play a central role in our management of the environment.

Reference-contexts: The nonlinear system is solved using functional iterations. The main idea is to speed up these iterations using explicit solutions for several groups of species. The method seems to work fine for very large step-sizes. A particularly clear approach is taken by Gong and Cho <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One of the best ways to deal with this is to use the standard message-passing library MPI <ref> [15] </ref>, that assures the portability with almost no penalty on efficiency. We also must consider scalability, i.e. to achieve an increasing speeedup when the program is run on more processors. This means that in parallel implementation we have to find the most appropriate grain for the parallelization.

Reference-contexts: One of the most important questions for which this tool should provide an answer is to be able to select the best way of partitioning the data among processors. The kind of code analysis that this tool has to perform includes interprocedural analysis <ref> [16] </ref> and array region analysis. An optimizing compiler usually performs only intraprocedural analysis, i.e. it does not attempt to understand the data dependencies between procedures. In order to detect coarse grain parallelism in an application one has to do some kind of interprocedural analysis.

Reference-contexts: This greatly helps the numerical computations. However, the scheme is difficult to generalize to solve more general problems. Recently, Hertel, Berkowicz, Christensen, and Hov <ref> [17] </ref> proposed an algorithm based on the implicit Euler method. The algorithm uses linear operators only and preserves the mass. The nonlinear system is solved using functional iterations. The main idea is to speed up these iterations using explicit solutions for several groups of species.

Reference-contexts: The two step method seems to allow very large step-sizes.

Information about the speed-ups obtained with sparse versus full linear algebra are presented in Table 1. In the usual practice, atmospheric modellers sometimes employ Gear type methods (see <ref> [19] </ref>). Our results indicate that when linear algebra is treated efficiently, implicit methods from different families, like Singly-Diagonal-Implicit-Runge-Kutta or Rosembrock, [25] can be competitive. and CHEMEQ.

Reference-contexts: However the performance of implicit methods depends critically on the implementation of linear algebra (which appears in connection with Newton steps) and on their restart overhead (when used in an operator splitting environment). We have begun to explore these ideas <ref> [25] </ref>. We believe that it is possible to exploit sparsity in the Jacobian systematically and hence to develop more efficient implementations of fully implicit methods for solving atmospheric chemistry problems. 1. We evaluated reordering techniques that lead to minimal fill-in during LU decomposition. <p> Information about the speed-ups obtained with sparse versus full linear algebra are presented in Table 1.
