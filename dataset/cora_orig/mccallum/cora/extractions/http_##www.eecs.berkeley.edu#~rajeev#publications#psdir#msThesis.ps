Reference-contexts: This enables one to use analytical methods of linear system analysis. In the past, small signal stability was taken for granted, and hence the analysis of small signal stability is not as widespread as transient stability analysis <ref> [1] </ref>. Recently there have been a number of papers in this area and a number of small signal stability techniques have been developed [1-8]. The small signal stability of a power system may be analysed using any of the methods applicable to linear systems. <p> The Small Signal Stability Program Package (SSSP) <ref> [1, 10] </ref>, developed by Ontario Hydro under a joint effort with EPRI, provides facilities for representing the system components with a wide range of models and for computing eigenvalues using several alternative techniques. <p> Hence, it is sufficient to show that for each pair i; j 2 f1; 2; : : : ; `g the polynomial p ij (s; ) = p i (s) + (1 )p j (s) (3.4) is D-stable for all 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In references [52-55], various solutions for the above-mentioned theorem have been dealt with for special cases of interest. Zeheb [56] performs a sweep involving a scalar variable used in the parametric representation of the boundary of D. <p> maps the real variable *<ref> [0; 1] </ref> onto the continuous boundary @ of any region in the complex plane, which contains the origin s = 0 in its interior. If we take to be the unit disk, then we can take () = cos 2 + j sin 2 for 2 [0; 1] to satisfy : [0; 1] ! @. For each fixed pair (; ffi) 2 [0; 1] fi &lt;, h (; ffi) is defined as h (; ffi) i ` &lt; (); p i ( D (ffi)) &gt; (3.5) The inner product in Eq. (3.5) is defined as follows: If <p> If we take to be the unit disk, then we can take () = cos 2 + j sin 2 for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to satisfy : [0; 1] ! @.

Reference-contexts: Voltage stability has long been studied by both static and dynamic approaches. In the static approach, voltage collapse is analysed by using load flow equations which are algebraic in nature. This includes load flow feasibility [11-13], multiple load flow solutions approach <ref> [14] </ref>, sensitivity analysis [15, 16], and minimum singular value [17, 18]. Kwanty et al.

Reference-contexts: A parametric study for each of these phenomena has been done individually but not in terms of a comprehensive model. The effect of nonlinear voltage-dependent loads on the system stability has been investigated in [36] using the same model. We also extend the results of an earlier paper <ref> [29] </ref> regarding the role of the system Jacobian, algebraic Jacobian and the load flow Jacobian on voltage collapse. A 3-machine 9-bus system is chosen to illustrate our studies, but the research grade program developed is general enough to handle larger systems. <p> 1 X + A 2 I g + A 3 Z g + Eu (2.48) 0 = C 1 X + C 2 I g + C 3 Z g + C 4 Z ` + S Lg (V ) (2.50) 23 Equations (2.48)-(2.51) are equivalent to the model in <ref> [29] </ref> except that a machine angle is not introduced as reference. This model is quite general and can easily be expanded to include frequency or _ V dependence at load buses or PSS dynamics. <p> B 3 3 7 7 7 5 6 6 6 6 x v 7 7 7 7 + 6 6 6 6 0 S 2 7 7 7 7 + 6 6 6 6 E 0 7 7 7 7 U (2.60) This model is slightly different from that in <ref> [29] </ref> in the sense that we allow for voltage dependency for the loads in the vectors S 1 and S 2 . For the constant power case, both S 1 and S 2 are 0. <p> 6 6 6 x v 7 7 7 7 + 6 6 6 6 E 0 7 7 7 7 U (2.61) Now ~ C 3 is the load flow Jacobian J LF and 2 6 4 ~ C 2 ~ C 3 7 7 = J AE as in <ref> [29] </ref>. <p> For the model-A the matrices A 1 ; ; D 2 (given in Eqs.(2.48)-(2.51)) are given in Appendix B. The real and/or reactive loads at a particular bus/buses was increased continuously. At each step the initial conditions of state variables were computed, after running the load flow <ref> [29] </ref>, and linearization of the equations was done. The A sys matrix was formed and its eigenvalues were checked for stability. Also detJ LF and detJ AE were computed. <p> Also detJ LF and detJ AE were computed. The step-by-step algorithm is as follows: (a) Increase the load at bus/buses for a particular generating unit model. (b) Run the load flow. 28 (c) Stop, if load flow fails to converge. (d) Compute initial conditions of state variables <ref> [29] </ref>. (e) Linearize the differential equations and compute the various matrices.

Zeheb [56] performs a sweep involving a scalar variable used in the parametric representation of the boundary of D. Barmish <ref> [35] </ref> constructs a real continuous scalar function H (ffi) of a real variable ffi and proves 41 that P is D-stable if and only if for each ffi 2 &lt;; H (ffi) &gt; 0. <p> The positivity test on the robust stability testing function H (ffi) need only be computed for ffi in a bounded precomputable interval . 3.2 Robust Stability Testing Function The robust stability testing function H (ffi) <ref> [35] </ref> is found by using two boundary sweeping functions, D (ffi) and (). <p> of h (; ffi) with respect to *[0; 1] then H (ffi) = h ( fl (ffi); ffi) (3.6) If the region D can be represented by a finite number of pathwise connected regions in the complex plane and if P has at least one D stable polynomial, then Barmish <ref> [35] </ref> has proved that P is D-stable if and only if for each ffi 2 &lt;, H (ffi) &gt; 0 (3.7) Since the set of polynomial coefficients associated with P is compact, the zeros of polynomials in P lie in a bounded subset of the complex plane [57]. <p> The set is taken to be the unit circle. 5. The robust stability testing function H (ffi) is generated and plotted. The ffi sweep bound for the half plane obtained by using the crude bound <ref> [35] </ref> was found to be too high. It was adequate to limit it to 1. To begin with, n pq was chosen to be 5. It was found that the H (ffi) function dips highly negative for both of the boundary regions (Figs. 3.3 (a) and 3.3 (b)). <p> The basic problem encountered was that the parameters do not appear linearly in the CLCP any more, which limits the application of either the D-partition technique or the testing function of Barmish <ref> [35] </ref>. The case in which parameters appear multilinearly is discussed in [59]. <p> The parametric approach to robust stability as reviewed in [47] was used to find the limits on the load indices so that the desired stability of the system is achieved. The generalized Kharitonov's theorem as given in <ref> [35] </ref> was used for this purpose. This technique can only handle the parametric perturbations which appear linearly in the characteristic polynomial. The effects of other parameters such as K A ; and K F can be observed via the matrix counterpart of the polynomial approach.

Reference-contexts: The phenomena also depends on how one models both the machine and the excitation system. A parametric study for each of these phenomena has been done individually but not in terms of a comprehensive model.

We also extend the results of an earlier paper [29] regarding the role of the system Jacobian, algebraic Jacobian and the load flow Jacobian on voltage collapse.

Reference-contexts: Various Mathematical Models The mathematical model consists of differential equations (pertaining to machine and ex citer dynamics and algebraic equations (corresponding to the stator and network equations). 2.2.1 Model A (two-axis model with IEEE Type I exciter) The differential equations of the machine and the exciter are given as in <ref> [37] </ref>. <p> (2.10) k=1 P Li (V i ) k=1 Q Li (V i ) k=1 for i = m + 1; :::; n 12 2.2.2 Model B (flux decay model and fast exciter) If the damper winding time constants T 0 qoi are very small, then use of singular perturba tions <ref> [37] </ref> makes the E 0 di dynamics very fast so that (2.4) becomes an algebraic equation: 0 = E 0 qi )I qi E 0 qi )I qi (2.14) The differential and algebraic equations of the two-axis model will be modified by substituting Eq.

Reference-contexts: This model is quite general and can easily be expanded to include frequency or _ V dependence at load buses or PSS dynamics. It is comprehensive in the sense that the effect of load indices on voltage stability can be studied through a multivariable transfer function approach as in <ref> [38] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The appropriate definition and determination as to which state variables significantly participate in the selected modes become very important. This requires tools for identifying state variables that are significant in producing the selected modes. Perez-Arriaga <ref> [39] </ref> gives a relative modal coupling coefficient q, but his approach is too conservative. It has been suggested [40-42] that the significant state variables for an eigenvalue b i are those that correspond to large entries in the eigenvector v i .

If the voltage dependency of the load is of the form S Li (V i ) = P `o;i V i ! n pi V o;i Then this formulation can be used to obtain a closed-loop transfer function between Z and S L (as discussed in Section 3.3.1). <p> The system diagram and the data have been given in Appendix C. The same system was considered in <ref> [44] </ref>, where reactive power modulation was of primary concern. The generator dynamics are represented by the swing equation, flux decay dynamics and a first-order AVR giving rise to four state variables (X T = ffi, !, E 0 q and E fd ).

Reference-contexts: It was observed that from the stability point of view that the constant power-type is the worst kind of load followed by the constant current and then the constant impedance-type. This agrees with the observation in <ref> [46] </ref>. But this technique is applicable only for the case when the parameters appear linearly or bi-linearly in the coefficients. 38 CHAPTER 3 ROBUST STABILITY APPLICATION 3.1 Introduction The modeling of physical systems is a process which inherently depends on making various assumptions. The uncertainty in the modeling is inevitable. <p> In the second case, when the exciter is modeled as IEEE Type-1, the instability is caused by the electrical variables (E 0 q & R f ). The effect of the type of load was studied and the results confirmed the observation in <ref> [46] </ref>. With the linearized model, it was also possible to obtain a transfer function between 54 the voltage variables and the load in the system. This transfer function is utilized to study the effect of load indices of nonlinear voltage-dependent loads on the system stability.

Reference-contexts: If this condition is satisfied, then we say that P is D stable. In 1978, Russian researcher Kharitonov <ref> [49] </ref> gave the seminal theorem on the stability of a linear continuous system under parameter variations for one special case of the D-stability problem. He proposed a necessary and sufficient condition for the left-half plane or Hurwitz stability for an interval polynomial family.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the stability problem for the interval polynomial family P is reduced to four applications of the Routh-Hurwitz 40 stability criterion. For low-order polynomials, a simplified theorem was provided by Jury et al. <ref> [50] </ref>. Kharitonov's theorem has two major limitations: * In most of the modeling of the physical systems, the parameters appear in more than one coefficient of the characteristic polynomial. Coefficient perturbations no longer remain independent; thereby, we obtain a polytopic perturbation of coefficients, rather than a rectangular one.

Reference-contexts: Kharitonov's result becomes conservative in this case. * The D stability region which Kharitonov had chosen is the left-half plane. For a general stability region, this theorem no longer remains valid. Several results have been obtained to generalize the result of Kharitonov. Bartlett et al. <ref> [51] </ref> proposed the edge theorem. They assume that D is simply connected and coefficient perturbations are polytopic. This polytopic requirement means that P can be expressed as the convex hull of finitely many generating polynomials p 1 (s); p 2 (s); :::; p ` (s).
