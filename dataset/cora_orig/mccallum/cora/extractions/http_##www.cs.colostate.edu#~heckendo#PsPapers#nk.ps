Abstract: We use Walsh analysis to show NK-Landscapes form an extremely restricted set of functions out of the set of N bit functions that have interactions between K +1 or fewer bits. Several upper bounds on the extent of the coverage by NK-Landscapes are created based on theory developed in the paper.

Reference-contexts: That is wherever there is a 1 in i there is a 1 in j or, said another way, i ^ j = 0. * ff and fi are defined on a hyperplane by the bit by bit replacements below as per Goldberg <ref> [1] </ref>: ff (h) = f0; 1g ! 1 fflg ! 0 fi (h) = f1g ! 1 For the hyperplane h = fl fl 1101fl : ff (h) = 0011110 and fi (h) = 0011010. * hf i h is the average of the values of the function f over the <p> x (i) = 1 P 2 M 1 P x:pack (x;m)=j v (j) x (i) = 1 P 2 M 1 P x:pack (x;m)=j x (i) = 1 P 2 M 1 P = 1 P 2 M 1 P We know from the Balanced Sum Theorem for Hyper- planes <ref> [1] </ref> that X i (x) = 0 if i ^ ff (h m;j ) 6= 0 where jh m;j j is the number of strings in h m;j . But as we have seen ff (h m;j ) = m.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION A very useful and popular experimental model for correlated landscapes is Stuart Kauffman's NK-Landscapes <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. An NK-Landscape is a function f : B N !R where K is the number of bits in the chromosome that epistatically interact with each bit. One of the nice features of NK-Landscapes is that K acts as a tunable ruggedness control. <p> A hyperplane or schema is denoted in the usual way. For example, hyperplane h for strings in B 7 might be **1101*. * Let [i] denote extracting the i th bit. So if x =1111011 then x <ref> [2] </ref> = 0. x [i; j] denotes extracting and right justifying the bits i through j. For example x [2; 5] =1110. * The bit count function bc (i) returns the number of 1's in i. <p> For example, hyperplane h for strings in B 7 might be **1101*. * Let [i] denote extracting the i th bit. So if x =1111011 then x [2] = 0. x [i; j] denotes extracting and right justifying the bits i through j. For example x <ref> [2; 5] </ref> =1110. * The bit count function bc (i) returns the number of 1's in i. For example bc (001011) = 3 and bc (15) = 4. * i j where i; j 2 B L reads as i is contained in j. <p> The user should be aware, on the one hand, that for most K, NK-Landscapes are a very small part of the possible functions of limited . On the other hand, this exact set of functions has shown a tremendous breadth of behavior as seen in Kauffman <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and that in itself is fascinating.

Reference-contexts: The duplicate counts are subtracted and yield the final column which is the maximum number of nonzero coefficients for the given masks. In general, by using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle <ref> [4] </ref> from combinatorics we can see for f based on N functions that are expanded using masks m b : b 2 f1; 2; :::; N g the distribution of Walsh counts can be calculated as follows: ~ f = 1iN X ~ ij + 1i&lt;j&lt;kN ~ ijk (1) N ~

A zero value for a Walsh coefficient means that the bit combination represented by the index of the coefficient does not play a role in the computation of the function <ref> [5] </ref>. For example: if for all i where the bit count bc (i) = 5, w i = 0 then there are no 5 bit epistatic interactions.
