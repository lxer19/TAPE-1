Abstract: A distributed-memory parallel computer (the "ff7") with a peak-performance of more than GFlop was implemented on an area of 300 square inch. The seven processing elements are interconnected using Intelligent Communication a communication scheme already approved in the MUSIC, a DSP based parallel computer of the Electronics Lab. The combination of processing elements built up using standard components with a fast, low-latency communication scheme implemented in hardware leads to a powerful parallel computer for the scientist's or engineer's workplace. Several of these computers can be joined via an optical network to form a distributed supercomputer.

Reference-contexts: Many of these tasks have a great potential for parallel processing, i.e. they can be divided into several subtasks which are independently processed in parallel on different processors. From 1990 to 1993 the Electronics Laboratory designed and built a parallel computer called MUSIC (MUltiprocessor System with Intelligent Communication) <ref> [1] </ref>. It is a single user single task machine connected to a host computer as an attached processor. MUSIC systems with up to 63 processors and a peak performance of 3.8 Gigaflops are operational.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 3. Photograph of the Board The DECchip 21066 with 166 MHz clock rate has been chosen as the microprocessor for the PEs. It has almost the same performance as the 21064-150 and additionally a memory controller and a PCI controller are integrated (compare <ref> [2] </ref>). The high level of integration of this microprocessor allows to build a complete PE not larger than 4.5 fi 5.5 inch.
