Abstract: when the coupling between them is negligible. Linear interpolation is used to compute values between different widths in look-up tables, and linear interpolation on 1=spacing is used to compute values between different spacings. Furthermore, linear extrapolation is used for widths and spacings that exceed values in look-up tables. More sophisticated formulas presented in [5, 1] can be used here. But layouts in gate-array and standard-cell often exhibit a limited set of widths and spacings. Therefore, look-up tables with reasonable size can suffice, along with limited use of interpolation and extrapolation. Two nets were extracted from real designs and their lumped capacitances were computed based on the 2 1/2-D methodology. We also separated the two nets into a number of small sections and used a 3-D simulator to solve all the relevant geometries for these sections. Capacitances from different sections were then summed. Table 11 compares results from the two methods; errors were 0.54% for the smaller net and 3.33% for the larger one. Our method has separately been validated in cooperation with the Motorola RISC Division, Semicustom Operation by comparing extracted and measured capacitances. We have validated five "foundations" that allow simplification of the capacitance extraction problem for multilayer intercon Table 11: Comparison between 2 1/2-D analysis and 3-D simulation. nects. We have also described a simple yet accurate 2 1/2-D extraction methodology, now implemented in a commercial cell-based layout tool. We showed that this methodology gives results that are very close (within a few percent) to measured silicon and 3-D numerical simulation. Typical extraction and performance verification flows often ignore one or more factors such as process variations, thermal gradients, errors in device and cell characterization, foundry insertion of dummy metal, etc. Since these errors can swamp our several percent error versus 3-D simulation, we conclude that the proposed 2 1/2-D methodology is sufficient for layout optimization. Our ongoing research and development seeks a more holistic integration of synthesis and analysis activities within a framework for constraint-driven design. [6] J. Cong, L. He, A. B. Kahng, D.
