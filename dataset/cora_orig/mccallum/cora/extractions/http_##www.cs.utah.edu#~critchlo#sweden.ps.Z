Abstract: The Human Genome Project poses severe challenges in database design and implementation. These include comprehensive coverage of diverse data domains and user constituencies; robustness in the presence of incomplete, inconsistent and multi-version data; accessibility through many levels of abstraction, and scalability in content and organizational complexity. This paper presents a new data model developed to meet these challenges by the Utah Center for Human Genome Research. The central characteristics are (i) a high level data model comprising five broadly applicable workflow notions; (ii) representation of those notions as objects in an extended relational model; (iii) expression of working database schemas as meta data in administration tables; (iv) population of the database through tables dependent on the meta data tables; and (v) implementation via a conventional relational database management system. We explore two advantages of this approach: the resulting representational flexibility, and the reflective use of meta data to accomplish schema evolution by ordinary updates. Implementation and performance pragmatics of this work are sketched, as well as implications for future database develo pment. The Human Genome Project is a 15-year, $3 billion international effort to sequence (identify) all 3 billion nucleotides (bases) found in human chromosomes, as well as the genomes of selected model organisms. The human genome comprises an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 genes, each of length 10,000 to 1 million bases. In coarsest terms, the human genetic sequencing problem amounts to deriving by laboratory observation a string of length 3 billion over a four-letter alphabet. While this sounds like (and is) a vast undertaking, a computer scientist might smugly observe that this monotonous string comprises only 6 billion bits, or

Reference-contexts: Related work Worldwide genetic data resides on several very large community databases, plus hundreds of smaller laboratory databases. Most of the community databases, such as the GDB genetic linkage database (GDB <ref> [4] </ref>), are currently implemented using the traditional relational model within an RDBMS. The schema evolution problems with this model are evidenced by the criticism that GDB has faced for its inability to evolve its data representation to meet community needs on a timely basis.
