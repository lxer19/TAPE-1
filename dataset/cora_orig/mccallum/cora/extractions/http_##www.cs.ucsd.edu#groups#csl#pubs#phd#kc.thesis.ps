Reference-contexts: Internet research on protocols and their performance are somewhat relevant, three core areas of research on datagram networks serve as inspiration for our work. First, local area network (LAN) traffic characterization studies, which are fairly comprehensive in their assessment of traffic, e.g., on an Ethernet <ref> [2] </ref> [3]. Second, wide area network (WAN) infrastructural traffic characterization studies, which focus on the use of operational statistics from wide area backbone infrastructures to investigate specific issues, e.g., routing [4], packet trains [5]. <p> Related to utilization is the congestion of the network, or contention for either bandwidth or switching resources. Measurements of congestion include distributions of queue length or available buffers in nodes. Several studies of local area environments focus on short-term utilization characteristics <ref> [2] </ref> [23] [3]. Longer term utilization metrics would include traffic volume growth over several years on a backbone infrastructure [24].

Traditionally, network researchers have used interarrival time distributions to indicate burstiness. Gusella <ref> [3] </ref> presents and interprets the distribution of packet lengths and packet interarrival times on a dedicated Ethernet for the three protocols that carry significant traffic: TCP, ND (Network Disk protocol, for paging traffic), and NFS (Network File System, for remote file access). <p> While these studies focus on LAN, specifically Ethernet, traffic, Paxson and Floyd [58] also comment on the potential self-similarity of wide-area traffic. They also note that packet interarrivals are not exponentially distributed [28] <ref> [3] </ref> [32] [13]. They evaluate several TCP arrival process in fifteen wide area packet traces to determine the error of modeling them as Poisson. We discuss their work further in section 7.2. <p> In this section we focus on the distribution of interarrival times between flows. Figure 2.4 depicts the difference between the arrival process as a counting process and the interarrival times. Several studies have found evidence that Internet packet arrivals do not seem to exhibit Poisson behavior [28] <ref> [3] </ref> [32] [23] [58]. In contrast, as we will see, the Poisson model does seem to adequately characterize Internet flow arrivals as defined by certain parameters. Previous attempts to characterize Internet arrival processes have concentrated on traffic by component, e.g., telnet, ftpdata.

Previous studies indicate that packet arrivals are not independently distributed through time [28] <ref> [5] </ref> [6] [63] [64] [24], and so it is likely that 100 packets from a 10 second interval will not provide the same estimate as 100 packets spaced over a 1 minute interval, even when differing utilization may render the number of packets in the two parent populations equal.

Reference-contexts: Finally, WAN traffic characterization studies which focus on a single or a few attachment points to transit networks to investigate shorter-term aspects of certain kinds of Internet traffic, e.g, TCP <ref> [6] </ref>, TCP and UDP [7], dns [8]. The first half this dissertation combines the comprehensiveness of the first area, LAN characterization, with the infrastructural aspect of the second cloud, operational WAN traffic characterization. <p> differs from UDP, ftp differs from telnet, so in addition to the total makeup of the traffic, per-protocol profiles (discussed in section 2.4.7) are important network descriptors. 2.4.7 Individual flow metrics Studies have shown that the time of day and type of network influence the cross-section of wide area traffic <ref> [6] </ref> [30] [58], making it important to measure not only the cross-section itself, but also how individual components of the cross-section contribute to the aggregate traffic workload. <p> Profiling also includes metrics of individual flows within that application, such as the number of packets per flow, the number of bytes per flow, and flow duration. Several profiling studies of TCP traffic have investigated Internet traffic passing through attachment points to wide area transit networks. Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> profile Internet conversations by characterizing individual end-to-end TCP communication transactions. They define a flow as a stream of packets traveling between the end points of an association, delimited by a twenty-minute silence. <p> Danzig and Jamin [32] use results of the work of Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> to create a library of realistic empirically-based TCP workload characteristics for use in network simulation [32] [60] They create a workload library (tcplib) consisting of a stub-dependent component, since the breakdown of individual TCP applications differs by stub network, and a stub-independent component, since their data indicates that some characteristics <p> Such uses of the network, such as with packet audio and video, are incompatible with currently deployed congestion control methodologies that assume cooperation from the virtual circuit oriented connection end points of TCP. For example, Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> investigate policies for caching virtual circuits in networks without permanent virtual circuits (PVC's). Because they did not have a conversation interarrival model as discussed above, they focused on intra-conversation activity, and did not address how long dynamic virtual circuits should remain open once the conversations using them have ceased. <p> However, network traffic is typically non-stationary, and so the effect of spreading the sampled packets over a longer interval is not clear. Previous studies indicate that packet arrivals are not independently distributed through time [28] [5] <ref> [6] </ref> [63] [64] [24], and so it is likely that 100 packets from a 10 second interval will not provide the same estimate as 100 packets spaced over a 1 minute interval, even when differing utilization may render the number of packets in the two parent populations equal. <p> Although many have applied the packet train model of flows to the transport or application layers [35] [33] [34] or focused only on TCP traffic flows <ref> [6] </ref> [31], we offer a comprehensive methodology of timeout-based flow characterization at the IP layer for use in datagram environments. <p> The lower half of the figure depicts multiple independent flows, of which thousands may exist simultaneously at wide area transit points. Our definition of timeout is similar to that used in other definitions of packet trains <ref> [6] </ref> [28] [31] [34] [60], although most studies adopt an ad hoc timeout value rather than investigating the effect of varying it across a range as we do. <p> Jain originally selected for his study of local network traffic a timeout of 500 2 Such lightweight protocols are particularly appropriate for continuous media streams such as audio or video. 56 57 milliseconds. 3 For their studies of wide-area traffic at the transport layer, Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> used a 20-minute timeout, motivated by the FTP idle timeout value of 15 minutes, and after comparison to a 5-minute timeout yielded minimal differences. <p> Bulk transfer and transaction protocols also exhibit more predictable 3 Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> using a 20-minute flow timeout, found that 75-90% of bulk transfer conversations consist of less than 10 kilobytes of data. Our results, although slightly different, are also consistent with their measurements that indicate that over 90% of interactive conversations consist of less than a thousand packets. <p> Our results, although slightly different, are also consistent with their measurements that indicate that over 90% of interactive conversations consist of less than a thousand packets. We note the difficulty of getting a picture of telnet flows given unidirectional traffic; Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> and Paxson [61] show that interactive applications can generate as much as ten times more traffic in one direction than the other. <p> In contrast, as we will see, the Poisson model does seem to adequately characterize Internet flow arrivals as defined by certain parameters. Previous attempts to characterize Internet arrival processes have concentrated on traffic by component, e.g., telnet, ftpdata. As mentioned in section 2.4.7, Caceres et al. <ref> [6] </ref> provide evidence that characteristics of an instantiation of a specific TCP application do not depend on the environment, but that 88 characteristics of the conversation arrival process itself do. <p> However we also feel it will be important to characterize the aggregate arrival process, regardless of transport protocol or application. This approach will be increasingly relevant as different types of Internet traffic proliferate, decreasing the proportion of traffic carried by traditional protocols. The model in <ref> [6] </ref> provides parameters for only five TCP applications (ftpdata, rlogin, nntp, smtp, telnet), which represent a decreasing proportion of Internet traffic (see figure 3.10). These five applications represent only about half of current NSFNET traffic in packets, about 63% in bytes, decreasing gradually over the last few years [80].

Reference-contexts: actual workload conditions * knee capacity, or point on the delay versus throughput curve where delay increases significantly * efficiency: ratio of maximum achievable throughput (usable capacity) to nominal capacity 9 Studies of network throughput often focus on design or performance assessment of proposed or existing protocol mechanisms or algorithms <ref> [22] </ref>. 2.4 Network centric perspective We next discuss network-centric metrics. 2.4.1 Utilization The first metric that typically comes to mind in describing a network, at least for a network operator, is utilization. <p> Several new proposals involve queueing algorithms to control congestion <ref> [22] </ref> [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53], and thus assume integral caching mechanisms for the maintenance of state for each communicating host-pair flow. The potential efficacy of such proposals depends critically on network locality. <p> Emerging real-time applications that consume significantly more resources than current ones will also add to the burden of network switching equipment. Several new proposals involve queueing algorithms to control congestion in the face of such new applications on the network <ref> [22] </ref> [48] [52] [49] [51] [50] [53], and will rely on integral caching mechanisms to maintain state for each communicating flow. Future Internet routers will likely have to cope with vastly different forwarding procedures in cases of different packet addresses or policy options.

Reference-contexts: Related to utilization is the congestion of the network, or contention for either bandwidth or switching resources. Measurements of congestion include distributions of queue length or available buffers in nodes. Several studies of local area environments focus on short-term utilization characteristics [2] <ref> [23] </ref> [3]. Longer term utilization metrics would include traffic volume growth over several years on a backbone infrastructure [24]. <p> More recent investigations have proposed other notions of burstiness, such as focusing on the arrival process, as a counting process, rather than the interarrival process. Willinger et al. [55] <ref> [23] </ref> have studied the packet arrival process, and the correlation of packet arrivals in local environments. In their study of several Ethernet environments [23] they present evidence that Ethernet traffic is self-similar, implying no natural burst length.

Reference-contexts: Measurements of congestion include distributions of queue length or available buffers in nodes. Several studies of local area environments focus on short-term utilization characteristics [2] [23] [3]. Longer term utilization metrics would include traffic volume growth over several years on a backbone infrastructure <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> Other studies, though not focused on packet trains in particular, also find evidence for locality even in 10 networks of wider geographic scope, e.g., regional networks and national backbones [29] [5] [30] [31] [32] <ref> [24] </ref> [7]. Others [33] [34] [35] have extended the packet train model to the transport and application layers, defining a train as a quadruple of source/destination address pairs in conjunction with port numbers. <p> Packet payload is one indicator of protocol efficiency, although a more accurate analysis of efficiency will also reflect end-to-end behavior, including acknowledgment, retransmission, and update strategies of different protocols. The differences in payload per application are also visible at the aggregate level. Claffy et al. <ref> [24] </ref> [59] present evidence for significantly different distributions of traffic by packets and bytes by individual network numbers using the NSFNET. <p> Section 3.5.2 provides a detailed explanation of the relevance of network numbers and their configuration to traffic characterization. 11 Further details on NSFNET traffic locality appear in Claffy et al. <ref> [24] </ref> [88]. 32 aggregated every fifteen minutes. These data show daily cycles which are compatible with the hypothesis of bulk transfer applications, using larger packet sizes, intensifying during the off-peak hours, or correspondingly, that interactive traffic, generally characterized by smaller packet sizes, drops off during off-peak hours. <p> However, network traffic is typically non-stationary, and so the effect of spreading the sampled packets over a longer interval is not clear. Previous studies indicate that packet arrivals are not independently distributed through time [28] [5] [6] [63] [64] <ref> [24] </ref>, and so it is likely that 100 packets from a 10 second interval will not provide the same estimate as 100 packets spaced over a 1 minute interval, even when differing utilization may render the number of packets in the two parent populations equal.

Spatial locality refers to the likelihood of reference to memory locations near previously referenced locations. Temporal locality refers to the likelihood of future references to the same location. <p> Temporal locality refers to the likelihood of future references to the same location. In network traffic, the concentration of references to a small fraction of addresses and the persistence of references to recently used addresses are analogous concepts <ref> [26] </ref>. Jain presents data using three measures of locality: the network traffic "income" distribution, which can reflect long or short-term locality; and two metrics that only apply to short-term locality assessment: the average working set size as a function of packet window size, and the stack depth probability distribution. <p> Just as program and data caching policies can exploit memory reference locality in a virtual memory system, router designers can exploit traffic locality with analogous schemes such as caching network address and specialized flow information in switching nodes. Feldmeier [36] and Jain <ref> [26] </ref> simulate caching algorithms on traffic traces taken from LAN gateways. Feldmeier [36] estimated the potential benefit of caching on the performance of gateway routing tables. <p> His conservative conclusion was that caching could reduce gateway routing table lookup time by up to 65%. In addition to caching destination addresses, his simulations indicate benefits from caching source addresses as well. Jain <ref> [26] </ref> also performed trace-driven cache simulations for traffic at DEC gateways. Simulating MIN (optimal), LRU, FIFO, and random replacement algorithms, he found significantly different locality behavior between interactive and non-interactive traffic. The interactive traffic did not follow the LRU stack model while the noninteractive traffic did.

Reference-contexts: The stack level probability distribution measures the likelihood of reference to a network address as a function of the previous reference to that address. Gulati et al. <ref> [27] </ref> offers four locality metrics, two of which overlap with those of Jain: persistence; address reuse, which is similar to persistence with the requirement for consecutive reference loosened; concentration; and reference density. Reference density reflects the number of communicating entities responsible for a given percentile of the network traffic. <p> They also use the traces to perform simulations of an LRU cache for different conversation granularities, and find that improvements in state lookup time are possible with a small cache, even without special hardware. Gulati et al. <ref> [27] </ref> have explored LAN cache performance of source addresses, destination addresses, and both source and destination addresses. In their measurement study of LAN traffic they find that it is more important to cache destination rather than source addresses, especially for caches with more than 15 entries.

Reference-contexts: Many previous studies have established the existence of network traffic locality, in particular short-term traffic locality in specific network environments for selected granularities of network traffic flow. Jain originally established the packet train model to study traffic locality behavior on a local area network <ref> [28] </ref>. Other studies, though not focused on packet trains in particular, also find evidence for locality even in 10 networks of wider geographic scope, e.g., regional networks and national backbones [29] [5] [30] [31] [32] [24] [7]. <p> Such traffic exhibits the same correlation structure at various aggregation granularities. They conclude that empirical data demands reexamination of currently considered formal models for packet traffic, e.g., pure Poisson or Poisson-related models such as Poisson-batch or Markov-Modulated Poisson processes [56], packet-train models <ref> [28] </ref>, and fluid flow models [57]. In particular, their evidence indicates that Poisson modeling assumptions are false for environments that aggregate much traffic. <p> While these studies focus on LAN, specifically Ethernet, traffic, Paxson and Floyd [58] also comment on the potential self-similarity of wide-area traffic. They also note that packet interarrivals are not exponentially distributed <ref> [28] </ref> [3] [32] [13]. They evaluate several TCP arrival process in fifteen wide area packet traces to determine the error of modeling them as Poisson. We discuss their work further in section 7.2. <p> More recent studies on isolated aspects of the NSFNET have investigated the existence of packet trains on the NSFNET backbone [5], and evaluated specific routing approaches for use on the backbone [4]. Heimlich [5] experimented with an extension of Jain's packet train model <ref> [28] </ref> to a wide-area environment, verifying the existence of packet trains on the 1989 NSFNET national backbone. While one can not expect the packet train phenomenon to be as striking in a traffic-aggregating national backbone network as it is on the local network that Jain studied [28], Heimlich found that it <p> Jain's packet train model <ref> [28] </ref> to a wide-area environment, verifying the existence of packet trains on the 1989 NSFNET national backbone.

As an alternative, Jain offered the packet train model of packet arrivals to describe traffic on a token ring local area network at MIT <ref> [28] </ref>. He defined a packet train as a burst of packets arriving from the same source and heading to the same destination. If the spacing between two packets exceeds some inter-train gap, they are said to belong to separate trains. <p> The lower half of the figure depicts multiple independent flows, of which thousands may exist simultaneously at wide area transit points. Our definition of timeout is similar to that used in other definitions of packet trains [6] <ref> [28] </ref> [31] [34] [60], although most studies adopt an ad hoc timeout value rather than investigating the effect of varying it across a range as we do. <p> In this section we focus on the distribution of interarrival times between flows.

Reference-contexts: While these studies focus on LAN, specifically Ethernet, traffic, Paxson and Floyd <ref> [58] </ref> also comment on the potential self-similarity of wide-area traffic. They also note that packet interarrivals are not exponentially distributed [28] [3] [32] [13]. They evaluate several TCP arrival process in fifteen wide area packet traces to determine the error of modeling them as Poisson. <p> UDP, ftp differs from telnet, so in addition to the total makeup of the traffic, per-protocol profiles (discussed in section 2.4.7) are important network descriptors. 2.4.7 Individual flow metrics Studies have shown that the time of day and type of network influence the cross-section of wide area traffic [6] [30] <ref> [58] </ref>, making it important to measure not only the cross-section itself, but also how individual components of the cross-section contribute to the aggregate traffic workload. <p> Figure 2.4 depicts the difference between the arrival process as a counting process and the interarrival times. Several studies have found evidence that Internet packet arrivals do not seem to exhibit Poisson behavior [28] [3] [32] [23] <ref> [58] </ref>. In contrast, as we will see, the Poisson model does seem to adequately characterize Internet flow arrivals as defined by certain parameters. Previous attempts to characterize Internet arrival processes have concentrated on traffic by component, e.g., telnet, ftpdata. <p> Paxson [61] provides further evidence that traffic patterns vary greatly, both over time and more so from site-to-site, not only in traffic cross-section but also in connection characteristics. Paxson and Floyd <ref> [58] </ref> use fifteen wide-area traces to investigate the extent to which TCP arrival processes (session and connection arrivals, ftpdata connection arrivals within ftp sessions, and telnet packet arrivals) are Poisson.

Reference-contexts: Packet payload is one indicator of protocol efficiency, although a more accurate analysis of efficiency will also reflect end-to-end behavior, including acknowledgment, retransmission, and update strategies of different protocols.

Our definition of timeout is similar to that used in other definitions of packet trains [6] [28] [31] [34] <ref> [60] </ref>, although most studies adopt an ad hoc timeout value rather than investigating the effect of varying it across a range as we do.

Reference-contexts: Other applications, many likely with quite different characteristics, e.g., multimedia have begun to consume significant bandwidth. Nonetheless their library offers an important basis for comparison with data collected in other environments at other times. Paxson <ref> [61] </ref> [62] [30] investigates wide-area TCP connections which originate from three levels of the Internet, spanning university campuses, corporate research sites, a regional site, and an international gateway environment. <p> However, reasonable differentiation among the other methods was not possible with the traditional 2 goodness-of-fit testing methods. Other sophisticated goodness-of-fit tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov [99] or Anderson-Darling A 2 [100] tests, have proven difficult to apply to wide-area network traffic data <ref> [61] </ref>. Another disparity metric, which we refer to as cost, measures the absolute distance, or l 1 norm, between the expected and observed bin counts: P B i=1 jO i E i j. Consider the following example use of the cost metric. <p> Our results, although slightly different, are also consistent with their measurements that indicate that over 90% of interactive conversations consist of less than a thousand packets. We note the difficulty of getting a picture of telnet flows given unidirectional traffic; Caceres et al. [6] and Paxson <ref> [61] </ref> show that interactive applications can generate as much as ten times more traffic in one direction than the other. <p> They admit that they were "unable to form a realistic and network-independent model of conversation arrivals, since the arrival parameters depend on geographic site, day of week, time of day, and possibly other factors" [114]. Paxson <ref> [61] </ref> provides further evidence that traffic patterns vary greatly, both over time and more so from site-to-site, not only in traffic cross-section but also in connection characteristics.

Kleinrock and Naylor referred to this tendency on the 1973 ARPAnet as the "favorite site" effect <ref> [65] </ref>. One can see a definite difference in workload profile among these three networks; the supercomputer center tends to exhibit a higher degree of favoritism than the other networks, and the campus communicates with a significantly larger number of sites. <p> Locality describes the phenomenon of a non-uniform distribution of traffic to, from, or among a select few sites <ref> [65] </ref>. Network locality presents an obstacle to characterizing packet arrival processes as either Poisson or compound Poisson. As an alternative, Jain offered the packet train model of packet arrivals to describe traffic on a token ring local area network at MIT [28].

Reference-contexts: Since that study, the infrastructure has increased substantially in scope, bandwidth, and traffic aggregation, largely due to the advent of the NSFNET in the mid 1980's, which was able to extend the seeds of ARPAnet research into what is now a global TCP/IP infrastructure. Chinoy and Braun <ref> [67] </ref> describe in detail the underlying topology of the NSFNET backbone in its various stages. More recent studies on isolated aspects of the NSFNET have investigated the existence of packet trains on the NSFNET backbone [5], and evaluated specific routing approaches for use on the backbone [4].

Reference-contexts: Chinoy and Smith <ref> [68] </ref> present details of the T3 network architecture, which evolved from the experience of managing the T1 network. Backbone nodes, the core packet switches in the T3 infrastructure, are designated as either Exterior Nodal Switching Subsystems (ENSSs) or Core Nodal Switching Subsystems (CNSSs). <p> The physical and electrical interfacing to these lines is handled by a Data Service Unit (DSU). Nearly all of the DS3 circuits are terrestrial fiber-optic lines; other possible media are microwave and copper <ref> [68] </ref>. To access external client networks, the T3 backbone nodes currently use Ethernet and FDDI interfaces, with packet size upper limits of 1.5 and 4 kilobytes, respectively. Each packet is also encapsulated within an Ethernet or FDDI frame, which the LAN drivers at 19 the endpoints append and remove.

Reference-contexts: The T3 routing technology and architecture is functionally equivalent to that on the T1 network. Packets travel through the network individually and are passed from node to node aided by an adaptive, distributed routing procedure based on the standard IS-IS protocol <ref> [69] </ref>. Buffering on the output queues of the nodes contributes to the latency of the delivery of packets to the destination. On the T3 backbone, the number and size of buffers in each node depends on the interface type and operating system version.

Reference-contexts: But the number of silent networks has increased since announcement of the addressing guidelines outlined above. When service providers receive large blocks of class C addresses in anticipation of and aligned with Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) <ref> [87] </ref> requirements, they immediately configure the addresses with the NSFNET before assigning them to customers, increasing the number of silent networks in the NSFNET backbone configuration database. <p> Eventually, as policy routing issues render the source as well as the destination of a packet relevant to routing decisions, the issue of two-sided flow assessment will also become important. Furthermore, as new routing mechanisms utilize alternative hierarchical definitions related to IP network numbers (e.g., CIDR masks <ref> [87] </ref>), the desired granularity may evolve somewhat. Network service providers may want to define coarser-grained flows as network number pairs for which they will create virtual circuits crossing their network, e.g., ATM cloud, each of which will bundle many finer-grained IP flows.

Interestingly enough, simple random sampling is less efficient than either systematic or stratified random sampling in this situation <ref> [97] </ref>. 4.4.1 Theoretical sample size for means Cochran [96] provides a detailed explanation of the statistical determination of the appropriate random sample size for estimating a given parameter of a population, such as the mean or proportion.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the 2 statistic is sensitive to the size of the data set, making it difficult to compare samples of varying sizes. Therefore, it cannot quantify significant trends when varying the sampling fraction, one of our primary concerns. Goodman and Kruskal <ref> [98] </ref> note that although useful as a test for the significance of the association between two data sets, the 2 statistic, or any simple function of it (e.g., the significance level), cannot serve as a measure of degree of association between two sets.

Reference-contexts: A service provider might also want a relative cost measure, for example the product of l 1 with the sampling fraction, to account for the resource savings of sampling less often. All these metrics are still subject to the influence of the sample size. Fleiss <ref> [101] </ref> offers another alternative metric to measure the degree of similarity between two distributions which is free of the influence of the sample size: the (phi) coefficient.

Reference-contexts: Request/response applications will accordingly yield bidirectional packet trains. Another suggested definition of a flow derives from a different motivation: the need for service functionality inherently incongruous with the datagram architecture of the Internet. Clark <ref> [102] </ref> proposes: : : : a better building block than the datagram for the next generation of architecture. The general characteristic of this building block is that it would identify a sequence of packets traveling from the source to the destination, without assuming any particular type of service... <p> Clark refers to this concept of soft state as a potential method of achieving the "goals of survivability and flexibility, while at the same time doing a better job of dealing with the issue of resource management and accountability" <ref> [102] </ref>. The two motivating factors, characterizing traffic locality and supporting special service capabilities, are not unrelated.

Reference-contexts: In particular, until end-to-end ATM is a reality, IP gateways attached to ATM style networks will have to multiplex possibly many IP flows onto the ATM substrate. Mapping higher level (IP) flows to underlying link level virtual circuits [103] [104] [105] <ref> [107] </ref> will require effective setup, maintenance, timeout strategies, and accounting schemes. One requirement will be graceful handling of idle connections, regardless of transport layer behavior. <p> Clearly ignorance of higher layer information regarding the nature of the traffic imposes a high opportunity cost. This data also has implications for multiplexing IP flows onto a wide-area ATM substrate using virtual circuits (VCs). Caceres <ref> [107] </ref> suggests that the optimal multiplexing policy for bulk transfer conversations whose packet transmission rates are limited by transport protocol windows sizes and available bandwidth, e.g., ftp, smtp, nntp, would be one virtual circuit per conversation.

Reference-contexts: One requirement will be graceful handling of idle connections, regardless of transport layer behavior. Service providers may charge for these idle connections, such as in an ATM network, and terminating and restarting them as needed would be more efficient <ref> [108] </ref>. Transport layer flow assessment will not be adequate to determine whether to set up a new virtual circuit as a new flow arrives, or place the traffic into cells on an existing ATM virtual circuit between two end points of the ATM substrate. <p> The analogy to virtual memory caching is thrashing, which will occur if flow demands are larger than available router resources and require constant closing and reopening of flows. In this section we explore how the timeout value influences the probability of thrashing. Saran and Keshav <ref> [108] </ref> investigate one timeout strategy: timeout occurs if a packet for a flow has not appeared in the time between the last packet of the flow and the one immediately preceding it, i.e., within the last intra-flow packet interarrival time.
