Abstract: The observed distribution of natural images is far from uniform. On the contrary, real images have complex and important structure that can be exploited for image processing, recognition and analysis. There have been many proposed approaches to the principled statistical modeling of images, but each has been limited in either the complexity of the models or the complexity of the images. We present a non-parametric multi-scale statistical model for images that can be used for recognition, image de-noising, and in a generative mode to synthesize high quality textures.

Reference-contexts: On easy data sets, such as the the MeasTex Brodatz texture test suite, performance is slightly higher than other techniques, our approach achieved 100% correct classification compared to 97% achieved by a gaussian MRF approach <ref> (Chellappa and Chatterjee, 1985) </ref>. The MeasTex lattice test suite is slightly more difficult because each texture is actually a composition of textures containing different spatial frequencies.

Reference-contexts: Each of these tasks is reasonably efficient, requiring no more than a few seconds or minutes on a workstation. The statistical modeling of images is an endeavor which reaches back to the 60's and 70's <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. Statistical approaches are alluring because they provide a unified view of learning, classification and generation. To date however, a generic, efficient and unified statistical model for natural images has yet to appear. Nevertheless, many approaches have shown significant competence in specific areas.

Reference-contexts: (Shrinkage Residual) the residual error between the shrinkage de-noised result and the original notice that the error contains a great deal of interpretable structure; (Denoise Ours) our de-noising approach (SNR 13.2 dB); and (Our Residual) the residual error these errors are much less structured. this case Gabor Convolution Energy method <ref> (Fogel and Sagi, 1989) </ref> achieved 89%. Gaussian MRF's explicitly assume that the texture is a unimodal distribution and as a result achieve only 79% correct recognition.

Reference-contexts: To date however, a generic, efficient and unified statistical model for natural images has yet to appear. Nevertheless, many approaches have shown significant competence in specific areas. Perhaps the most influential statistical model for generic images is the Markov random field (MRF) <ref> (Geman and Geman, 1984) </ref>. MRF's define a distribution over images that is based on simple and local interactions between pixels. Though MRF's have been very successfully used for restoration of images, their generative properties are weak.

Reference-contexts: The primary evidence for this conjecture is that the coefficients of wavelet transformed images are uncorrelated and low in entropy (hence the success of wavelet compression). These insights have been used for noise reduction (Donoho and Johnstone, 1993; Simoncelli and Adelson, 1996), and example driven texture synthesis <ref> (Heeger and Bergen, 1995) </ref>. The main drawback of wavelet algorithms is the assumption of complete independence between coefficients. <p> The difference in these distributions can be used as the basis of noise reduction algorithms, by reducing the wavelet coefficients which are more likely to be noise than signal. Specific image classes can be modeled using similar methods <ref> (Heeger and Bergen, 1995) </ref> 2 . For a given set of input images the empirical distribution of the c k 's is ob served.

Reference-contexts: Computation of the F i j 's is a linear transformation that can thought of as a single matrix W . With careful selection of g and f i this matrix can be constructed so that W 1 = W &gt; <ref> (Simoncelli et al., 1992) </ref> 1 . Where convenient we will combine the pixels of the feature images F i j (x; y) into a single cause vector ~ C. The expected distribution of causes, c k , is a function of the image classes that are being modeled.

Reference-contexts: Rather than generating each of these coefficients independently, we define a chain across 2 See <ref> (Zhu, Wu and Mumford, 1996) </ref> for a related but more formal model. 3 Their generation process is slightly more complex than this, involving a iteration designed to match the pixel histogram.
