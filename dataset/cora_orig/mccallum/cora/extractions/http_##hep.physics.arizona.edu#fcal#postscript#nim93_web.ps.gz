Abstract: Electron Testbeam Results for the ATLAS Liquid Argon Abstract A novel liquid argon calorimeter concept with thin cylindrical shell gaps, meeting the required physics performance for the forward region (jj &gt; 3) in a high energy, high luminosity hadron collider experiment such as ATLAS, is described. A prototype for the electromagnetic section was built and tested in two electron testbeam runs at the Brookhaven AGS and at the CERN North Area in 1993, covering a total energy range from 2 to 200 GeV. Dependencies of the signal on the impact angle and varying inactive material in front of the calorimeter have been studied. Important performance requirements such as signal linearity better than 2%, a sufficient energy resolution with a constant term of about 4% and a very good space resolution of about 0:6 mm have been demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Some of the most important physics to be reconstructed at future high energy, high luminosity hadron collider experiments such as ATLAS <ref> [1] </ref> at the LHC requires calorimetric coverage at least to pseudo-rapidities jj ~ 5.

Reference-contexts: Fast charge collection to minimize pile-up and, even more, the low mobility of the ionized argon require small gaps of active medium on the order of only a few 100 m, to avoid a luminosity dependent calibration due to positive charge build-up <ref> [3] </ref> and to suppress additional signal fluctuations originating from the same effect. A simple, practical solution to obtain precision narrow gaps in a sampling calorimeter is a tube/rod geometry, where the active gaps are tubular in shape (cylindrical shells).

Reference-contexts: Important physical parameters are listed in Table 1. The whole calorimeter is mounted on a support structure suspended below the top plate of a small cryostat, as shown in Fig. 3. A LAr purity monitor using a fi source (as described in <ref> [4] </ref>) is mounted on the same support.

Reference-contexts: Each motherboard has a charge pulse source and 16 individual preamp boards on it, holding the preamp itself and a shaper. The preamp design scheme follows the ";T" approach <ref> [5] </ref>. As the charge collection time is rather short (about 50 ns), a shaping time of about 50 ns was chosen to avoid significant signal losses due to ballistic deficit effects.

Reference-contexts: Early and late pile-up vetos are used to avoid pileup at high rates. No severe deadtime problems have been observed, even at the high event rate at CERN (few hundred valid particle triggers per second). 3.3 Simulations The GEANT 3.15/90 <ref> [6] </ref> framework with the standard electromagnetic shower description is used to simulate the electron testbeam runs. Electrons, positrons, and photons are tracked down to the lowest possible energies within GEANT (10 keV), to avoid artificial enhancements of the transition effect [7] in the thin gaps.

Reference-contexts: Electrons, positrons, and photons are tracked down to the lowest possible energies within GEANT (10 keV), to avoid artificial enhancements of the transition effect <ref> [7] </ref> in the thin gaps. The setup of the FCal prototype in the simulation program includes a detailed description of the hardware, including all details of the rod and tube assembly (see section 2.1). <p> Fig. 10 shows the energy resolution obtained for electrons without and with extra material in the beam. A sampling term of a = (36:3 0:3)%= p GeV and a constant term c = (4:7 0:1)% can be found in a common fit of (see <ref> [7] </ref>, for example): (E)=E = a 2 =E beam + c 2 (5) to BNL and CERN data (Fig. 10 (a)).

Reference-contexts: The fitted impurity of about 0.6 ppm oxygen, using the model described in <ref> [8] </ref>, is in very good agreement with independent measurements from an oxymeter and the radioactive sources. From this the absolute charge efficiency was found to be about 96% and stable during the whole run period.

Reference-contexts: As noise measured by fluctuations of the signal in individual channels in randomly triggered empty events (pedestal fluctuations) does not always follow an easy to model distribution, it is added event-by-event to the simulated response, on a channel-by-channel basis, following the method described in <ref> [9] </ref>. To do this a common scale for the simulation and the experimental signal must be used; here the charge scale, as defined by eq. (1) for experimental data, is taken. <p> The average relative difference between these two signals, determined at various beam energies, then defines the residual experimental deviation from linearity for an intrinsically linear calorimeter design <ref> [9] </ref>. Fig. 7 shows good agreement between the experimental and simulated energy response distributions for the FCal prototype. The absolute experimental charge scale can presently be understood from the comparison of the average response from data and simulation for various beam energies to about 5%.

Reference-contexts: A position-dependent correction is applied which is based on a careful reconstruction of the impact point exclusively from calorimeter signals by means of a multi-parameter likelihood method and signal correction tables parameterized by the impact point coordinates <ref> [12] </ref>. The average contribution of electronic noise to signal fluctuations in the cluster defining the total signal (see section 4.1) has been determined to be 2:24 GeV (0:23 GeV) for CERN (BNL) data. <p> These parameters have been determined via a sophisticated algorithm based on an impact point reconstruction using a multi-parameter likelihood method <ref> [12] </ref> which explicitly takes into account the lateral electromagnetic shower shapes and the available channel granularity (same as for the signal correction mentioned above). The reconstructed impact point is then compared to the beam position measured in the x-y hodoscope (Fig. 4, section 3.2).

Reference-contexts: Space resolution for highest energies is also slightly improved to about 0:4 mm in this case. Based on the results from this first test and additional extensive engineering and physics performance simulation studies, including radiation shielding properties <ref> [13] </ref>, the calorimeter design presented in this note has been accepted by ATLAS as the baseline for the forward calorimeter. 21 Acknowledgements Many people contributed to the success of these testbeam experiments.
