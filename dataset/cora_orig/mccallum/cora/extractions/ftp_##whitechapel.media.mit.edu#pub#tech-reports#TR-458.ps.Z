Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 458 To appear in CHI 98 Abstract Our goal was to develop a computer system trained to sense a user's emotional state via the recognition of physiological signals. In the course of developing an exploratory pilot study toward this end, we encountered and addressed unique and context-dependent interface design and synchronization challenges. We used social science methods to induce a state of frustration in users, collected the physiological data, and developed an effective strategy for coupling these data with real-world events.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an incentive was created to increase the subjects' desire to play the game as fast as possible and receive a good score. Evidence from behavioral psychology suggests that if an individual is prohibited from attaining a specified goal, that individual will experience primary frustration <ref> [3] </ref>. Based on this evidence, we expected that if we created seemingly random, insurmountable obstacles to attaining a good score in the computer game, our subjects would experience frustration at approximately the same times that the obstacles occurred.

Why build an affective computer? Recent evidence demonstrates that humans have an inherent tendency to respond to media in ways that are natural and social, mirroring ways that humans respond to one another in social situations [6].

Recent evidence demonstrates that humans have an inherent tendency to respond to media in ways that are natural and social, mirroring ways that humans respond to one another in social situations <ref> [6] </ref>. Since affect is such an integral part of human-human social communication, we believe that computers with affect-recognition skills would make better interaction devices.
