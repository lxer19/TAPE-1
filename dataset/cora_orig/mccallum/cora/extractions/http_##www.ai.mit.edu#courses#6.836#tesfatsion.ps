Abstract: This paper presents a summary overview of the fast-developing field of artificial life, stressing aspects especially relevant for the study of decentralized market economies. In particular, a recently developed trade network game (TNG) is used to illustrate how the basic artificial life paradigm might be specialized to economics. The TNG traders choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continually updated expected utility and evolve their trade behavior over time. Analytical and simulation work is reported to indicate how the TNG is currently being used to study the evolutionary implications of alternative market structures at three different levels: individual trade behavior; trade network formation; and social welfare.

In addition, as detailed in Friedman (1991), a number of researchers have recently been focusing on the potential economic applicability of evolutionary game theory in which game strategies distributed over a fixed number of strategy types reproduce over time in direct proportion to their relative fitness. <p> Several economic studies that focus on key alife issues have either appeared or are in the pipeline.

On the other hand, choice and refusal also permit opportunistic players to home in quickly on exploitable players and form parasitic relationships.

To illustrate more concretely the potential usefulness of the alife approach for economics, as well as the hurdles that remain to be cleared, the following two sections take up a facet of alife work that appears to be particularly relevant for the modelling of decentralized market economies. <p> their chances of encountering other cooperative players, refusal gives players a way to protect themselves 5 Other game theory studies that have allowed players to avoid unwanted interactions, or more generally to affect the probability of interaction with other players through their own actions, include Fogel (1995), Guriev and Shakhova <ref> (1996) </ref>, Hirshleifer and Rasmusen (1989), Kitcher (1993), Mailath et al.

(1994, Section 2) and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996, Section 1) </ref> for more detailed discussions of related game theory work. <p> There is also a growing body of work on multi-agent systems with endogenous interactions in which the decision (or state) of an agent depends on the decision (or state) of certain neighboring agents, where these neighbors may change over time. See, for example, Brock and Durlauf (1995), De Vany <ref> (1996) </ref>, Ioannides (1996), and Young (1993). 3 from defections without having to defect themselves, and ostracism of defectors occurs endogenously as an increasing number of players individually refuse the defectors' game offers. <p> See, for example, Brock and Durlauf (1995), De Vany <ref> (1996) </ref>, Ioannides (1996), and Young (1993). 3 from defections without having to defect themselves, and ostracism of defectors occurs endogenously as an increasing number of players individually refuse the defectors' game offers. <p> The analytical and simulation findings reported for the IPD/CR game in Stanley et al. (1994), and in the subsequent studies by Smucker et al. (1994), Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref>, and Hauk (1996), indicate that the overall emergence of cooperation is accelerated in evolutionary IPD games by the introduction of choice and refusal. Nevertheless, the underlying player interaction patterns induced by choice and refusal can be complex and time varying, even when expressed play behavior is largely cooperative. <p> The analytical and simulation findings reported for the IPD/CR game in Stanley et al. (1994), and in the subsequent studies by Smucker et al.

Nevertheless, the underlying player interaction patterns induced by choice and refusal can be complex and time varying, even when expressed play behavior is largely cooperative. <p> The TNG has been implemented by McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref> with the support of a general C++ evolutionary simulation framework, SimBioSys, developed by McFadzean (1995). The TNG facilitates the general study of trade from a bottom up perspective in three key ways. <p> A particularly interesting aspect of the DCR mechanism is that it requires the tradebots to pass messages back and forth to each other at event-triggered times, a requirement that is easily handled by a C++ implementation; see McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>. 7 As detailed in Tesfatsion (1979), a criterion filter is an algorithm for the direct updating of an expected return function on 7 Player 2 c d Player 1 d (H,L) (D,D) Table 2: Payoff Matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma Game expected payoffs on the basis of new payoff information. <p> that only defects if defected against twice in a row; and an opportunistic trade strategy, Rip-Off, that evolved in an experiment with an initial population of Tit-for-Two-Tats to take perfect advantage of the latter strategy by defecting every other time. 8 As is more carefully explained in McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>, in each generation cycle the trade strategies (FSMs) associated with the current tradebot generation are evolved by means of a standardly specified genetic algorithm involving mutation, recombination, and elitism operations applied to bit string encodings for the strategies. <p> Two alternative benchmark assumptions will be considered for the tradebots' prior expected payoffs for their potential trade partners. The first assumption, a common prior, is the assumption made in Stanley et al. (1994), Smucker et al. (1994), and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref> for the IPD/CR game. The second assumption, long-run expectations, sets the prior expected payoffs that any two tradebots have for each other equal to the true long-run average payoffs that would result if these two tradebots were to engage in infinitely many trades. Assumption (CP): Common Prior. <p> Ideally, then, prior expected payoffs and minimum tolerance levels should be allowed to evolve conjointly with the tradebots' strategies. Some preliminary simulation work along these lines in the context of the IPD/CR game can be found in Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996, Section 5.4) </ref>. 3.3 Illustrative TNG Computer Experiments Two types of TNG computer experiments are reported in this section: (a) buyer-seller market experiments, in which each tradebot is both a buyer and a seller; and (b) two-sided market experiments, in which a subset of buyer tradebots makes offers to a disjoint <p> All experimental findings were obtained using the C++ implementation of the TNG developed by McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>. For each experiment, multiple runs from different initial random seeds are described. The following features are set commonly across all of these experimental runs. <p> These TNG experiments reinforce the previous IPD/CR findings of Stanley et al. (1994) and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref> that a preference-based matching mechanism tends to accelerate the emergence of mutual cooperation in the IPD when each agent is permitted both to make and to refuse game offers, is unconstrained with regard to the number of received offers he can accept, and is permitted to have at most one

To illustrate more concretely the potential usefulness of the alife approach for economics, as well as the hurdles that remain to be cleared, the following two sections take up a facet of alife work that appears to be particularly relevant for the modelling of decentralized market economies. <p> their chances of encountering other cooperative players, refusal gives players a way to protect themselves 5 Other game theory studies that have allowed players to avoid unwanted interactions, or more generally to affect the probability of interaction with other players through their own actions, include Fogel (1995), Guriev and Shakhova <ref> (1996) </ref>, Hirshleifer and Rasmusen (1989), Kitcher (1993), Mailath et al. (1994), and Orbell and Dawes (1993). See Stanley et al. (1994, Section 2) and Ashlock et al. (1996, Section 1) for more detailed discussions of related game theory work. <p> See Stanley et al. (1994, Section 2) and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996, Section 1) </ref> for more detailed discussions of related game theory work. <p> There is also a growing body of work on multi-agent systems with endogenous interactions in which the decision (or state) of an agent depends on the decision (or state) of certain neighboring agents, where these neighbors may change over time. See, for example, Brock and Durlauf (1995), De Vany <ref> (1996) </ref>, Ioannides (1996), and Young (1993). 3 from defections without having to defect themselves, and ostracism of defectors occurs endogenously as an increasing number of players individually refuse the defectors' game offers. <p> See, for example, Brock and Durlauf (1995), De Vany <ref> (1996) </ref>, Ioannides (1996), and Young (1993). 3 from defections without having to defect themselves, and ostracism of defectors occurs endogenously as an increasing number of players individually refuse the defectors' game offers. <p> The analytical and simulation findings reported for the IPD/CR game in Stanley et al. (1994), and in the subsequent studies by Smucker et al. (1994), Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref>, and Hauk (1996), indicate that the overall emergence of cooperation is accelerated in evolutionary IPD games by the introduction of choice and refusal. Nevertheless, the underlying player interaction patterns induced by choice and refusal can be complex and time varying, even when expressed play behavior is largely cooperative. <p> The analytical and simulation findings reported for the IPD/CR game in Stanley et al. (1994), and in the subsequent studies by Smucker et al.

Nevertheless, the underlying player interaction patterns induced by choice and refusal can be complex and time varying, even when expressed play behavior is largely cooperative. <p> The TNG has been implemented by McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref> with the support of a general C++ evolutionary simulation framework, SimBioSys, developed by McFadzean (1995). The TNG facilitates the general study of trade from a bottom up perspective in three key ways. <p> A particularly interesting aspect of the DCR mechanism is that it requires the tradebots to pass messages back and forth to each other at event-triggered times, a requirement that is easily handled by a C++ implementation; see McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>. 7 As detailed in Tesfatsion (1979), a criterion filter is an algorithm for the direct updating of an expected return function on 7 Player 2 c d Player 1 d (H,L) (D,D) Table 2: Payoff Matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma Game expected payoffs on the basis of new payoff information. <p> that only defects if defected against twice in a row; and an opportunistic trade strategy, Rip-Off, that evolved in an experiment with an initial population of Tit-for-Two-Tats to take perfect advantage of the latter strategy by defecting every other time. 8 As is more carefully explained in McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>, in each generation cycle the trade strategies (FSMs) associated with the current tradebot generation are evolved by means of a standardly specified genetic algorithm involving mutation, recombination, and elitism operations applied to bit string encodings for the strategies. <p> Two alternative benchmark assumptions will be considered for the tradebots' prior expected payoffs for their potential trade partners. The first assumption, a common prior, is the assumption made in Stanley et al. (1994), Smucker et al. (1994), and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref> for the IPD/CR game. The second assumption, long-run expectations, sets the prior expected payoffs that any two tradebots have for each other equal to the true long-run average payoffs that would result if these two tradebots were to engage in infinitely many trades. Assumption (CP): Common Prior. <p> Ideally, then, prior expected payoffs and minimum tolerance levels should be allowed to evolve conjointly with the tradebots' strategies. Some preliminary simulation work along these lines in the context of the IPD/CR game can be found in Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996, Section 5.4) </ref>. 3.3 Illustrative TNG Computer Experiments Two types of TNG computer experiments are reported in this section: (a) buyer-seller market experiments, in which each tradebot is both a buyer and a seller; and (b) two-sided market experiments, in which a subset of buyer tradebots makes offers to a disjoint <p> All experimental findings were obtained using the C++ implementation of the TNG developed by McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> (1996) </ref>. For each experiment, multiple runs from different initial random seeds are described. The following features are set commonly across all of these experimental runs. <p> These TNG experiments reinforce the previous IPD/CR findings of Stanley et al. (1994) and Ashlock et al. <ref> (1996) </ref> that a preference-based matching mechanism tends to accelerate the emergence of mutual cooperation in the IPD when each agent is permitted both to make and to refuse game offers, is unconstrained with regard to the number of received offers he can accept, and is permitted to have at most one
