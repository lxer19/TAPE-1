Reference-contexts: In particular, our preferred embodiment is based on the original Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. In doing so, we bring together the two concerns of the paper: applying techniques from distributed algorithms to mobile computing, and the problem of announcement delivery. <p> In this manner, as the local snapshots complete, the announcement copies are removed from the processing nodes, meeting the requirement that no copies remain in the system. (Note: These modifications can be made to any global snapshot algorithm that uses the notion of local snapshots, with both FIFO <ref> [1] </ref> and non-FIFO channels [8], however space limitations do not permit us to discuss the non-FIFO case in this paper.) We capture the essence of our solution in the form of a UNITY program shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: UNITY <ref> [2] </ref> provides a state transition model for concurrent programming in which progress and safety properties can be cleanly defined and proven from the program text. We utilize the UNITY proof logic in the appendix where we formally verify the correctness of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, even in broadcast or multicast, the restriction of single delivery of an announcement holds. Our modified multicast snapshot algorithm has worst-case overhead of one message per link in each direction to multicast. By contract, the algorithm used in IP DVMRP <ref> [3] </ref> effectively computes a tree. Its overhead is the number of links in the tree plus the number of links that have endnodes that participate in this multicast. 6.

Reference-contexts: While the unicast problem of delivering an announcement to a single recipient is important, in recent years the multicast problem of delivering an announcement to multiple recipients has also become crucial. Multicast support through the MBONE has become a standard part of the Internet <ref> [4] </ref> and is finding wide use for conferencing (e.g., tools like VIC and VAT [6, 9]) and video distribution. While multicasting and mobility have been treated as important extensions for the next generation Internet, the working groups in these areas have largely proceeded separately.

Reference-contexts: Minimizing storage requirements across the network is another concern. Standard solutions to unicast announcement delivery (e.g., cellular phones <ref> [5] </ref> and Mobile IP [11]) rely on tracking a mobile node as it moves around a fixed wired network.

Reference-contexts: Wireless technology and the decreasing size of computer components allow users to travel from office to home and around the country with the computer at their side. Both location-transparent and context-dependent services are desired. Decoupled computing is becoming the norm <ref> [7] </ref>. Disconnection is no longer a network fault but a common event intentionally caused by the user in order to conserve power or a consequence of movement.

Reference-contexts: The probability of error on such links may be small but packets are indeed dropped. A possible solution is to add acks for multicast messages as is done, for example, in the intelligent flooding algorithm used in Link State Routing in OSI [14] and OSPF <ref> [10] </ref>. Another solution is to only provide best-effort service.

Standard solutions to unicast announcement delivery (e.g., cellular phones [5] and Mobile IP <ref> [11] </ref>) rely on tracking a mobile node as it moves around a fixed wired network. For example, in cellular systems as a phone P moves from cell C to adjoining cell C', the phone detects a stronger signal from C' and requests a handoff from C to C'.

Reference-contexts: Connections on broadcast links can easily be modeled as point to point connections between a designated router on the LAN and all other routers as in OSI <ref> [12] </ref>. d) We assumed that a mobile node moves onto a link between two fixed network nodes. In practice, it is not clear in advance which neighboring cell a mobile node is moving to until it reaches the new cell and handoff occurs.

Reference-contexts: While multicasting and mobility have been treated as important extensions for the next generation Internet, the working groups in these areas have largely proceeded separately. An important open problem then is that of multicasting to mobile nodes. In existing multicast architectures like IP <ref> [13] </ref>, the sender sends to a multicast address X without knowing the set of stations that listen to X.
