Abstract: PROCESS CONTROL SIMULATION The process control application consists of three modules controlling production of maple syrup in a factory (see previous figures). The Sensor module monitors conditions in the factory such as the syrup temperature. The Control module makes decisions, such as adjusting the incoming sap ow, based on sensor values. A display shows an interactive, animated display of the factory. The display is drawn in EUPHORIA, utilizing user-defined widgets for each display component. End-users configure the communication among these modules at runtime by drawing connections between the published variables. Note that the FIRE and FLOW connections between the Control and EUPHORIA modules are bidirectional, allowing user interaction in the display to override decisions of the control module. SHARED CURSORS EUPHORIA can be used as a synchronized image display with shared cursors. A typical use of shared cursors is medical imaging, where physicians at different locations (e.g., a city and its suburb) want to discuss a medical image. Each physician has a graphical cursor which is moved over the image while talking about areas of interest. This multi-user GUI requires no programming; cursors are drawn in EUPHORIA and are linked through the use of graphical constraints and module connections. A rectangular region of interest can also be drawn and synchronized interactively. An interactive filtering application is created through the use of a number of communicating modules (see above). Spatial and Temporal filter modules are created independently, each having input and output image published variables. However, the spatial filtering operation is computationally intensive, requiring 61,236 oating point operations per frame. For this reason, a Dispatch module is used to distribute the images between two identical Spatial modules running concurrently on separate processors. The spatially filtered images are merged at the Temporal module, filtered, and sent to the Threshold module. EUPHORIA is used to control the filtering operation; users specify the movie name and threshold value. The original and filtered movies are also displayed within EUPHORIA.
