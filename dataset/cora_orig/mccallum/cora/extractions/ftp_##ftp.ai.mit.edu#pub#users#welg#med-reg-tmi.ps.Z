Title: An Automatic Registration Method for Frameless Stereotaxy, Image Guided Surgery, and Enhanced Reality Visualization

Abstract: There is a need for frameless guidance systems to help surgeons plan the exact location for incisions, to define the margins of tumors and to precisely identify locations of neighboring critical structures. We have developed an automatic technique for registering clinical data, such as segmented MRI or CT reconstructions, with any view of the patient on the operating table, using a series of registration algorithms, which we demonstrate on the specific example of neurosurgery. The method enables a visual mix of live video of the patient with the segmented 3D MRI or CT model, supporting enhanced reality techniques for planning and guiding neurosurgical procedures, and to interactively view extracranial or intracranial structures non-intrusively. Extensions of the method include image guided biopsies, focused therapeutic procedures and clinical studies involving change detection over time sequences of images.

Reference-contexts: This objective function is essentially the same as the maximum a posteriori model matching scheme of [40]. It acts much like a robust chamfer matching scheme, or an iterative closest point matching scheme, similar to that used by <ref> [23, 28, 3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The method does not require the use of previously attached frames or landmarks. The method has been combined with an enhanced reality visualization technique <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref>, in which we display a composite image of the 3D anatomical structures with a view of the patient. <p> This provides a transformation from patient to video camera. (7) The registered internal anatomy is displayed in enhanced reality visualization <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref> to "see" inside the patient. <p> This rendering can be mixed with the live video signal, giving the surgeon an enhanced reality view of the patient's anatomy <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref>. This can be used to plan a craniotomy or a biopsy, or to define the margins of an exposed tumor for minimal excision. When the laser scanner video camera is used for this purpose, the solution for the camera model is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: Because of its formulation, the objective function is generally quite smooth, and thus facilitates "pulling in" solutions from moderately removed locations in parameter space. As well, it bears some similarity to the radial basis approximation schemes used for learning and recognition (e.g. <ref> [5, 10] </ref>). (5.2) In earlier versions of the system, we used Powell's method [34] to iteratively minimize this evaluation function. Powell's method is basically a conjugate gradient descent method.

Reference-contexts: This registration enables the transfer to the operating room of preop-erative surgical plans, obtained through analysis of the segmented 3D preoperative data <ref> [8] </ref>, where they can be graphically overlaid onto video images of the patient. Such transfer allows the surgeon to apply carefully considered surgical plans to the current situation, and to mark internal landmarks used to guide the progression of the surgery. <p> The hope is that by providing this information to the surgeon, procedures can be more efficiently and effectively executed, with reduced side effects to the patient. 3 Details of Our Approach Part 1 of this scenario is standard practice. Methods currently exist for dealing with Part 2 <ref> [8, 13] </ref>. Here we focus on parts 3-8 of the above scenario. Parts 9-11 are part of our planned future work.

Automatically removing gain artifacts from the sensor data can be used to improve the segmentation [42]. Similarly, methods that correct for distortions due to magnetic susceptibility differences between different materials [35] can further improve the accuracy of the segmentation.

(5.2) In earlier versions of the system, we used Powell's method <ref> [34] </ref> to iteratively minimize this evaluation function. Powell's method is basically a conjugate gradient descent method. Starting at some initial point, it searches along a line in the parameter space for the point that minimizes the objective function along that line. <p> Powell's method is a simple means for choosing these conjugate directions, without directly estimating the gradient of the objective function.

This requires an estimate of the gradient of the objective function, which we describe below. <p> The DFP method essentially iteratively builds up a good approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix, which can then be applied to the data to solve for the parameters yielding a minimum of evaluation function <ref> [34] </ref>. Solving this minimization problem yields an estimate for the pose of the laser points in model coordinates.

Reference-contexts: Automatically removing gain artifacts from the sensor data can be used to improve the segmentation [42]. Similarly, methods that correct for distortions due to magnetic susceptibility differences between different materials <ref> [35] </ref> can further improve the accuracy of the segmentation. We refer to this 3D anatomical reconstruction as the model, which is represented relative to a model coordinate frame.

Reference-contexts: It also apparently requires some operator intervention to steer the system towards the correct solution, suggesting that local minima are a potential problem. Our system avoids this difficulty by randomly perturbing near final solutions to find better nearby minima. A second related approach is that of <ref> [6, 7, 24, 25, 36] </ref>. This method also does a least-squares minimization of a distance function to match data sets. Here, the distance is weighted by an estimate of the inverse variance of the noise in the measurements, and a Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to find the minimum.

Reference-contexts: It is unclear whether the removal of outliers is sufficient to keep the method from getting trapped into local minima. A third approach is that of <ref> [2, 19, 20, 21, 12, 37] </ref> who perform automatic rigid registration of 3D surfaces by matching ridge lines which track points of maximum curvature along the surface.

Reference-contexts: Two recent reviews of registration methods include [39, 1]. Of particular relevance are three different approaches. First, Pelizzari and colleagues <ref> [31, 27, 26, 18, 38, 33, 32, 13 30] </ref> have developed a method that matches retro-spective data sets, such as MRI or CT or PET, to one another.

Reference-contexts: an evaluation function that measures the amount of mismatch between the two data sets. (5.1) Evaluate the current pose by summing, for all transformed laser points, a term that is itself a sum of the distances (weighted by a Gaussian distribution) from the transformed point to all nearby model points <ref> [40] </ref>. This Gaussian weighted distribution is a method for roughly interpolating between the sampled model points to estimate the nearest point on the underlying surface to the transformed laser point. <p> a vector representing a model point, and T is a coordinate frame transformation, then the evaluation function for a particular pose (or transformation) is E 1 (T ) = i j 2 2 : (1) This objective function is similar to the posterior marginal pose estimation (PMPE) method used in <ref> [40] </ref>, and to the elastic net constraints of [9]. One can visualize this objective function as if we placed a Gaussian distribution of some spread at each model point, then summed the contributions from each such distribution at each point in the volume. <p> This objective function is essentially the same as the maximum a posteriori model matching scheme of <ref> [40] </ref>. It acts much like a robust chamfer matching scheme, or an iterative closest point matching scheme, similar to that used by [23, 28, 3].

Reference-contexts: The method does not require the use of previously attached frames or landmarks. The method has been combined with an enhanced reality visualization technique <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref>, in which we display a composite image of the 3D anatomical structures with a view of the patient. <p> This provides a transformation from patient to video camera. (7) The registered internal anatomy is displayed in enhanced reality visualization <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref> to "see" inside the patient. <p> This rendering can be mixed with the live video signal, giving the surgeon an enhanced reality view of the patient's anatomy <ref> [14, 4, 41] </ref>. This can be used to plan a craniotomy or a biopsy, or to define the margins of an exposed tumor for minimal excision. When the laser scanner video camera is used for this purpose, the solution for the camera model is straightforward.
