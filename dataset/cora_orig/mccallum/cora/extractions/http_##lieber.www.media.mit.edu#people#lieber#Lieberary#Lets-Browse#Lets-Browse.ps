Abstract: Web browsing, like most of today's desktop applications, is usually a solitary activity. Other forms of media, such as watching television, are often done by groups of people, such as families or friends. What would it be like to do collaborative Web browsing? Could the computer provide assistance to group browsing by trying to help find mutual interests among the participants? Let's Browse is an experiment in building an agent to assist a group of people in browsing, by suggesting new material likely to be of common interest. It is built as an extension to the Web browsing agent Letizia, which acts as an advance scout. Letizia does a real-time, incremental breadth first search around the user's current page, and filtering candidate pages through profiles learned from observing the user's browsing activity. Let's Browse features automatic detection of the presence of users, automated "channel surfing" browsing, and dynamic display of the user profiles and explanation of recommendations. Collaborative Browsing Increasingly, Web browsing will be performed in collaborative settings, such as a family at home or in a business meeting. For example, WebTV estimates that the average number of people who are watching during a session with its service is two, indicating that multiuser browsing is the norm rather than the exception. In most such situations, one person has control of the remote or the keyboard and mouse, and the others present are relatively passive. Yet the browsing session can't be considered successful if the interests of others present are not taken into account.
