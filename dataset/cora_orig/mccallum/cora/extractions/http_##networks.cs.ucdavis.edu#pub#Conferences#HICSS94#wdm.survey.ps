Abstract: Multiprocessor architectures based on optical interconnects employing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) are considered. WDM is a technique used to divide the tremendous bandwidth of a single strand of fiber into many non-interfering wavelengths. System components (processing, memory, and/or I/O elements) can use these wavelengths as communication channels. In this paper, we present the background needed to understand WDM architecture, outline several categories of single-hop communication protocols, and show how a multihop WDM-based multiprocessor can reconfigure itself to any virtual topology.

Reference-contexts: The Shu*eNet's mean hop distance is known [25], and the issue of routing has been well studied. Figure 4 shows how it is possible to assign wavelengths to each transmitter and receiver so that a Shu*eNet is created. 2 An alternative would be to employ a shared-channel multi-hop architecture <ref> [2] </ref>, but the sharing pattern should be relatively static (e.g., TDM).

Reference-contexts: The remainder of Section 2.1 discusses media access protocols that can be applied to both multiprocessors and local lightwave networks. Section 2.2 examines two prototype WDM local lightwave networks. 2.1.1 Fiber-Optic Crossconnect (FOX) The goal of the Fiber Optic Cross Connect (FOX) demonstration <ref> [3] </ref> was to investigate the potential of using fast tunable lasers and fixed receivers in a parallel processing environment. This is a T T F R system. <p> Each node receives on a dedicated channel. A binary exponential backoff algorithm was used for resolving contentions on each channel, and this architecture was found to achieve sufficiently good performance when memory accesses requests are relatively infrequent <ref> [3] </ref>. The transmitter tuning speed needed depends on the application, and for applications in which data packet transmission times are in the range 100 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond, transmitter tuning times less than a few tens of nanoseconds will ensure efficiency. <p> However, the maximum number of nodes in the network cannot exceed the total number of channels available, because each node requires one dedicated channel on which to fix its receiver. A WDM architecture similar to Fox is proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The N rows and M columns are connected by unidirectional links alternating in direction. Routing in the MSN has been examined in [31] and its structure is highly modular and easily growable. However, <ref> [5] </ref> found that, when N = 64, a Shu*eNet of N nodes has a smaller mean hop distance and a greater number of alternate routes than an N -node MSN.

Reference-contexts: However, in most multi-hop systems, this is not possible. An exception is the GEMNET <ref> [6] </ref> multi-hop topology. There is no restriction to the number of nodes a GEMNET can support (see Section 3.4). * Reliability: Optical fiber is an inherently low-loss medium, and the length of fiber needed for a multiprocessor interconnect is sufficiently small so that there is no need for optical amplification. <p> The MSN and Shu*eNet exhibit large mean hop distance when the number of nodes in the network is large, and the de Bruijn Graph and Shu*eNet have limited scalability and are not easily growable. GEMNET <ref> [6] </ref> is a generalization of the shu*e-exchange network and has none of these limitations. It has average hop distances at least as good as the above networks and is very scalable in the sense that it can grow one node at a time and can accommodate any number of nodes.

Reference-contexts: For an example of how a different virtual topologies may be embedded on a physical star network, see Section 3. In general, any virtual multi-hop topology, regular or otherwise, may be created from a WDM PSC-based interconnect (multi-hop topologies can also be created by using wavelength-routing switches [38] <ref> [7] </ref>, but these devices are beyond the scope of this paper). Physically, single-hop and multi-hop systems may be identical; however, the tuning characteristics of their transceivers separate the two. When multi-hop WDM architectures have their nodes equipped with tunable transceivers, they have the ability to reconfigure when traffic patterns change.

Reference-contexts: A WDM multiprocessor architecture can be de-signed by equipping each node with transmitters (lasers) and receivers (optical filters), and using fiber to connect every node to a passive star coupler (PSC) <ref> [11] </ref> (Figure 1). An N fiN PSC is an optical broadcast device made of 2 log 2 N stages of 2 fi 2 optical couplers, with the first log 2 N stages serving as a power combiner, and the remainder forming a power splitter. <p> Unfortunately, tuning time and tuning speed are inversely proportional. Injection-current-tuned lasers and electrooptic filters both have tuning speeds on the order of nanoseconds, but their tuning range is limited to only a few channels <ref> [11] </ref>. Mechanically tuned lasers and Fabry-Perot filters both exhibit a potential tuning range of hundreds of channels, but their tuning speed is on the order of millisec onds [11]. * Size: Current optical components are relatively bulky, when compared to their electronic counterparts. <p> electrooptic filters both have tuning speeds on the order of nanoseconds, but their tuning range is limited to only a few channels <ref> [11] </ref>. Mechanically tuned lasers and Fabry-Perot filters both exhibit a potential tuning range of hundreds of channels, but their tuning speed is on the order of millisec onds [11]. * Size: Current optical components are relatively bulky, when compared to their electronic counterparts. Again, as optical technology improves, we can expect the size of these components to diminish. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Using a WDM-based network for communication has many advantages over a conventional electronic bus and interconnect, as outlined below. * Bandwidth: The total usable bandwidth of a fiber can be multiplexed into approximately 200 WDM channels, each operating at 1 gigabit per second <ref> [12] </ref>. * Scalability: Power loss on a common bus grows linearly with the number of processors on that bus.

Reference-contexts: A WDM architecture similar to Fox is proposed in [3].

Reference-contexts: In order to reconfigure the virtual topology, some existing virtual connections may get disconnected and new ones may get added. This may cause packets in the network to be lost, desequenced or misrouted. <ref> [29] </ref> discusses two approaches to reconfiguration. In one approach, all the logical connections are shut down; then, the new connections are set-up. However, it may not be acceptable for the network to be disrupted at the time that reconfiguration is scheduled. <p> The second approach attempts to reconfiguration the system in a sequence of steps. During each step, a small portion of the network is unusable. Algorithms to minimize the time taken for the reconfiguration have been studied in <ref> [29] </ref>, where it is observed that the average number of steps required for reconfiguration to a random configuration is linear in the size of the network. 4 Conclusion WDM provides a solution to many of the architectural problems associated with massively parallel architectures.

Reference-contexts: Several media access protocols are discussed in Section 2. A WDM system in which any node may transmit to any other node in one direct hop is known as a single-hop network. In all single-hop WDM systems, either the transmitters, the receivers, or both, must be tunable <ref> [35] </ref>. In order for packet switching to be feasible, transceiver tuning time must be short, e.g., in the microsecond or nanosecond range [35][11]. However, state-of-the-art, fast-tunable transceivers have a limited tuning range [35][11]. <p> The architecture of a single-hop system can be characterized with the notation (CC) F T i T T j F R m T R n introduced in <ref> [35] </ref>, where a node has i fixed transmitters, j tunable transmitters, m fixed receivers, n tunable receivers, and the appearance of CC denotes that a dedicated channel, often referred to as a control channel, is employed for pretransmission coordination. <p> Readers are referred to <ref> [35] </ref> for a comprehensive review. In the following subsections, we briefly describe the architectures and media access schemes of several representative systems, emphasizing their potential application to massively parallel computers. Section 2.1.1 discusses a WDM interconnect that was specifically designed for multiprocessors.

Physically, single-hop and multi-hop systems may be identical; however, the tuning characteristics of their transceivers separate the two. <p> Power loss in a PSC grows logarithmically with the number of processors connected to it <ref> [38] </ref>. * Modularity: In most single-hop systems, a single node can be added to the network at any time without redesigning the entire system. However, in most multi-hop systems, this is not possible. An exception is the GEMNET [6] multi-hop topology.

Reference-contexts: Each node has an in degree and out degree of ffi, and there are N = ffi D total nodes. Some nodes may have self loops. De Bruijn Graph routing is simple, and there is an established upper bound on the mean hop distance <ref> [39] </ref>. In general, for the same N , a (ffi 2; D 2) de Bruijn Graph has a smaller mean hop distance than a (p; k) Shu*eNet, but Shu*eNet can support a higher throughput. <p> Also, due to the de Bruijn Graph's tendency to contain self loops, link loadings can be unbalanced even when the offered traffic is symmetric <ref> [39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A WDM architecture similar to Fox is proposed in [3]. An architecture that promises more scalability (by allowing more than one node per channel) is proposed in <ref> [41] </ref>. 2.1.2 Time Division Multiplexing Access Schemes (TDMA) A TDMA-based system proposed in [15] builds on a PSC physical topology with one tunable transmitter and one tunable receiver at each of the M nodes (a T T T R system).
