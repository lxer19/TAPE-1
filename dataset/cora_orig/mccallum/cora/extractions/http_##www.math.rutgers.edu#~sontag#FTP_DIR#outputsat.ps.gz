Abstract: In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for observability of the class of output-saturated systems. These are linear systems whose output passes through a saturation function before it can be measured.

Reference-contexts: So it may be necessary to use the control to move the output into the "linear window". It is easy to see that the boundaries of this window are not really relevant for the question of observability. We merely choose <ref> [1; 1] </ref> for convenience. In fact, could be a completely different function in each coordinate, as long as it is one-to-one in a neighborhood of 0 and saturated away from zero. <p> Finally, in Section 7 we study output-saturated systems with the added restriction of bounded inputs. We provide a characterization of observability for the class of bounded-input output-saturated systems for which the pair (A; B) is stabilizable. 2 Preliminaries First we give Bohr's definition of almost periodicity (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) then prove some technical lemmas. <p> Thus g + h has infinitely many zeros, and so f does too. Since g is a linear combination of periodic functions, it is itself an almost periodic function. (See <ref> [1] </ref>, Paragraph 48.) Thus we may apply Lemma 2.2 to the function g. Now suppose that lim inf g (t) = inf g (t) 0. Then the function G defined by G (t) := R t 0 g (t )dt is nondecreasing. <p> all j 2 J 0 , ~ = x, = 2x, satisfy C j e tA ~ = e t C j x; and (7) Clearly the signs of (7) and (8) are always the same, and x can be scaled so that both functions are outside the linear window <ref> [1; 1] </ref> for all t, contradicting observability. In the particular case in which J = f1; : : : ; pg, N = IR n , so A = A N .

Reference-contexts: If the nonlinearity is not injec-tive, it is no longer obvious from the observability matrix [C 0 A 0 C 0 (A n1 ) 0 C 0 ] 0 (prime indicates transpose), whether or not the state can be "observed" from the output. In <ref> [3] </ref>, we answered this question in the case in which provided the sign of the output of the linear system. That model was motivated by quantization and pattern recognition.

Reference-contexts: If there is any j 2 ~ J so that A j 6 0, then ~; can be distinguished with an argument as that used for sign-linear systems (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Otherwise, for all 6 j 2 ~ J, A j 0, so ~ J J .

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we will look at continuous-time sytems in which the function is the identity near the origin, but saturates the output values away from 0. (A preliminary version of this was presented at the American Automatic Control Conference, June 1992 <ref> [5] </ref>.) By an output-saturated system, we mean a continuous-time system : _x (t) = Ax (t) + Bu (t) fl Research supported by AFOSR under grant AFOSR-91-0343 y Research supported by AFOSR under grant AFOSR-91-0343 1 with A 2 IR nfin , B 2 IR nfim , C 2 IR pfin

Reference-contexts: Then Lemma 7.3 proves that (12) is not satisfied and so ios is not observable. Next we prove the converse. If Re () 0 for all 2 (A), then there exists an admissible control function u such that x (t) ! 0 as t ! 1. (See <ref> [6] </ref>.) In this case, it is obvious that for any x 0 there is a control u and a time T such that jy u (T; x 0 )j &lt; 1 so Lemma 7.1 implies observability.

Reference-contexts: So lim inf t!1 g (t) &lt; 0. Similarly, we may obtain that lim sup t!1 g (t) &gt; 0. Let ( ~ A; ~ C) be the observable pair of submatrices in the Kalman observability decomposition for the pair (A; C) (see <ref> [7] </ref>, Section 5.2): A 1 A 2 Let T 2 Gl (n) be the matrix providing the coordinate transformation. Proposition 2.6 Let A 2 IR nfin ; C 2 IR 1fin . The following statements are equivalent: 1. <p> Consider C (sI A) 1 = C (sI A) 1 I as a 1 fi n transfer matrix. As the triple (A; I; C) is canonical (controllable and observable), the eigenvalues of A are precisely the poles of this transfer matrix (see Corollary 5.7.2 in <ref> [7] </ref>). Thus C (sI A) 1 has no poles on IR + if and only if A has no eigenvalues on IR + , and conditions 2 and 3 are equivalent. To prove that condition 1 implies condition 3, suppose A has an eigenvalue 2 IR + .
