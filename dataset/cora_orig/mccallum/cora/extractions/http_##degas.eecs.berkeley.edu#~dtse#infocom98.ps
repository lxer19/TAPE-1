Abstract: To meet the increasing capacity demand on wireless networks, there have been intense efforts in the past decade on developing multi-user receiver structures which mitigate the interference between users in spread-spectrum and antenna array systems. While much of the research is performed at the physical layer, the capacity of networks with multi-user receivers and the associated resource allocation problems are less well-understood. In this paper, we show that under some conditions, the capacity of a single cell for several important receivers can be very simply characterized via a notion of effective bandwidth: the QoS requirements of all the users can be met if and only if the sum of the effective bandwidths of the users is less than the total number of degrees of freedom in the system. The number of degrees of freedom is the processing gain in a spread-spectrum system and the number of antenna elements in an antenna array. The effective bandwidth of a user depends only on its own QoS requirement, expressed in terms of the desired signal-to-interference ratio. It is hoped that such an abstraction of resource requirement will help in bridging the resource allocation problems at the networking layer and multi-user techniques at the physical layer.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest is the maximum number without power constraint, which we define to be the capacity of the system (in terms of number of users per degree of freedom.) This coincides with the definition of capacity taken in <ref> [1] </ref>; "capacity" is then the point at which saturation occurs as we put in so many users that we drive the required power level to infinity. We will show that this capacity is different but finite for both the conventional and the MMSE receivers, thus both are interference-limited systems.

Reference-contexts: The conventional matched filter results generalize very easily to P mf (j) = 1 j=1 ff j fi j where P mf (j) denotes the common received power level of all users of class j (see <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In practice, this means that the change in the spreading sequences is at a much slower time-scale than the symbol rate so that the receiver has the time to acquire the sequences. (There are known adaptive algorithms for which this can even be done blindly; see <ref> [3] </ref>.) However, the performance of the MMSE receiver depends on the initial choice of the sequences and hence random. The model for random sequences: let s m = 1 p (V 1m ; : : : ; V Lm ) , m=1, : : : M.

Reference-contexts: Now let us turn to the MMSE receiver. To satisfy given target SIR requirements for each user, <ref> [4, 12] </ref> showed that there is an optimal solution for which the received power of every user is minimized; moreover, they gave an iterative algorithm to compute it. However, here we can give an explicit solution and characterize the resulting system capacity.

Reference-contexts: The effective bandwidth of a user depends on the multi-user receiver employed. Results for three receivers are obtained. They are the minimum mean-square (MMSE) receiver [15, 6, 9, 10]), the decor-relator <ref> [5] </ref>, and the conventional matched filter receiver. We will show that the effective bandwidths are respectively e mmse (fi) = fi 1+fi , e dec (fi) = 1 and e mf (fi) = fi, where fi is the SIR requirement of the user. <p> It is also illuminating to compare its performance with that of the decorrelator. The decorrelator was in fact the first linear "multi-user detector" introduced by Lupas and Verdu <ref> [5] </ref>.

As a comparison, note that the conventional CDMA approach simply matches the received vector to s 1 , the signature sequence of user 1. This is indeed the optimal receiver when the interference from other users is white. <p> Thus, while the SIR of the matched filter receiver goes to zero for large interferers' powers, the SIR of the MMSE receiver does not. This is the well-known near-far resistance property of the MMSE receiver <ref> [6] </ref>. The intuition is that as the power of an interferer grows to infinity, the MMSE receiver will null out its signal.

Reference-contexts: For example, the effect of an individual interferer on the SIR for user 1 cannot be seen directly from this formula. In practice, it is often reasonable to assume that the spreading sequences are randomly and independently chosen (see eg. <ref> [7] </ref>). For example, they may be pseudorandom sequences, or the users choose their sequences from a large set of available sequences as they are admitted into the network.

Reference-contexts: To meet these challenges, there have been intense efforts in developing more sophisticated physical layer communication techniques. A significant thrust of work has been on developing multi-user receiver structures which mitigate the interference between users in spread spectrum systems. (See <ref> [13] </ref> for a survey.) Unlike the conventional matched filter receiver used in the IS-95 CDMA system, these techniques take into account the structure of the interference from other users when decoding a user. Another important line of work is the development of processing techniques in systems with antenna arrays.

Reference-contexts: The only difference here is that the L degrees of freedom is obtained by spatial rather than frequency diversity. These results should be compared with that of Winters et. al. <ref> [14] </ref>, which showed that for a flat Rayleigh fading channel, a combiner which attempts to null out all the interferers will cost one degree of freedom per interferer.
