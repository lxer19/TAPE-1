Reference-contexts: Parametric Geons In this section, we begin with the definition of parametric geons and then derive their mathematical formulation. Lastly, we illustrate certain properties of parametric geons and their relationship to the original Biederman's geons <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . 2.1 Definition Parametric geons are seven volumetric shapes which are derived from the superquadric equations (1), (2) and (3) by (i) specifying the shape parameters, * 1 and * 2 and (ii) applying tapering and bending deformations.

Reference-contexts: First, all the parametric geons are fitted to the object range data by minimizing the objective function. Second, the best model is selected according to the minimum residual. The objective functions studied previously by several researchers were strictly concerned with the first purpose <ref> [ 12, 45, 51, 53 ] </ref> , using a maximum likelihood estimator (L 2 norm). To accomplish the second purpose, the values of the objective function must correctly reflect the difference in size and shape between the object data and the parametric models. <p> Since the objective function possesses many local minima, nondeterministic optimization approaches must be employed. Some researchers have used a nonlinear least squares minimization (Levenberg-Marquardt) method, adding random walks to escape local minima <ref> [ 40, 12, 45, 47 ] </ref> . This is similar to simulated annealing but with an extremely fast annealing schedule.

Reference-contexts: Symmetrical primitives have also been employed in the variations of the original geons discussed by other researchers <ref> [ 42, 14 ] </ref> .

Furthermore, we do not permit tapering and bending to occur simultaneously. <p> Furthermore, we do not permit tapering and bending to occur simultaneously.

For a cylinder and a tapered cylinder, the greater the values of the 6.

Reference-contexts: Formulating asymmetrical primitives also requires more parameters which may lead model nonuniqueness. The assumption that all parametric geons are symmetrical with respect to their major axes is adopted in accordance with the known tendency in human perception toward phenomenal simplicity and regularity <ref> [ 25 ] </ref> . Symmetrical primitives have also been employed in the variations of the original geons discussed by other researchers [ 42, 14 ] .

Reference-contexts: In order to obtain a best fit of a model to an object, we need to find model parameters corresponding to the global minimum in an objective function. To accomplish this goal, we employ a stochastic optimization technique, Very Fast Simulated Re-annealing (VFSR fl ) <ref> [ 27 ] </ref> . Motivated by an analogy to the statistical mechanics of annealing in solids, simulated annealing (SA) technique uses a 'temperature cooling' operation for non-physical optimization problems, thereby transforming a poor solution into a highly optimized, desirable solution [ 32 ] . <p> Otherwise, the second term is always much larger than the first , even though the search procedure may terminate. The optimization algorithm used in these experiments is Very Fast Simulated Re-annealing (VFSR), a stochastic optimization approach <ref> [ 27 ] </ref> . Since the objective function possesses many local minima, nondeterministic optimization approaches must be employed. Some researchers have used a nonlinear least squares minimization (Levenberg-Marquardt) method, adding random walks to escape local minima [ 40, 12, 45, 47 ] .

Reference-contexts: Finally, when the temperature reaches zero, only downhill moves are permitted. The salient feature of this approach fl The advanced version of this program is called Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) <ref> [ 28 ] </ref> . 5. ACQUISITION OF MULTIPLE VIEW DATA 25 is to statistically deliver a global optimal solution. As an improved version of SA, VFSR permits an annealing schedule for T which decreases exponentially in annealing-time k, much faster than traditional (Boltzmann) annealing, where annealing schedule decreases logarithmly.

Reference-contexts: As an improved version of SA, VFSR permits an annealing schedule for T which decreases exponentially in annealing-time k, much faster than traditional (Boltzmann) annealing, where annealing schedule decreases logarithmly. The re-annealing property permits adaptation to changing sensitivities in the multi-dimensional parameter space. Recent research <ref> [ 29 ] </ref> has also shown that VFSR is orders of magnitude more efficient than a standard genetic algorithm [ 44 ] , another popular contender for global optimization.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with synthetic data, range data of geon-like objects and range data of imperfect geon-like objects were performed to examine the behavior of the objective function and the shape discrimination capabilities of such parametric models. Recently, Metaxas and Dickinson <ref> [ 33 ] </ref> presented a method for recovering volumetric primitives by integrating qualitative and quantitative techniques. Using intensity images containing perfect geon-like objects as input, they first recovered a qualitative geon model and then fitted a deformable superquadric to this qualitative model.

Recent research [ 29 ] has also shown that VFSR is orders of magnitude more efficient than a standard genetic algorithm <ref> [ 44 ] </ref> , another popular contender for global optimization. Using VFSR, we hope to reliably obtain parameters which describe the best fit between models and data based on our objective function. 5.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed discussion of the global deformation of solid shapes can be found in <ref> [ 2, 45 ] </ref> . 2.3 Characteristics of Parametric Geons Parametric geons as volumetric primitives carry information about the spatial distribution and surface orientation of 3D solid shapes. <p> First, all the parametric geons are fitted to the object range data by minimizing the objective function. Second, the best model is selected according to the minimum residual. The objective functions studied previously by several researchers were strictly concerned with the first purpose <ref> [ 12, 45, 51, 53 ] </ref> , using a maximum likelihood estimator (L 2 norm). To accomplish the second purpose, the values of the objective function must correctly reflect the difference in size and shape between the object data and the parametric models. <p> Since the objective function possesses many local minima, nondeterministic optimization approaches must be employed. Some researchers have used a nonlinear least squares minimization (Levenberg-Marquardt) method, adding random walks to escape local minima <ref> [ 40, 12, 45, 47 ] </ref> . This is similar to simulated annealing but with an extremely fast annealing schedule. <p> In addition, those methods which require a good initial estimate must assume that bending and tapering deformation takes place along only the longest side <ref> [ 45 ] </ref> . By using global optimization methods, we do not necessarily need to impose this constraint. Therefore more objects can be modeled, as shown in Figure 17. 8. Conclusion The contributions of this report are as follows: 1.

Reference-contexts: At USC, Rao and Nevatia have derived a linear straight homogeneous generalized cone description from sparse and imperfect 3D data [ 43 ] . Terzopoulos, Witkin and Kass obtained volumetric primitives by fitting a symmetry-seeking model <ref> [ 48 ] </ref> . Keren, Cooper and Subrahmonia at Brown University used fourth-degree implicit polynomials to represent volumetric objects [ 31 ] . It appears that the use of superquadrics to model volumetric objects has received more attention.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION 7 model <ref> [ 51 ] </ref> . Second, parameters in globally deformed superellipsoids tend to interact with each other in ways that make the model difficult to control. The extreme nonlinearity of the globally deformed superquadric equations makes the problem even more complicated. <p> First, all the parametric geons are fitted to the object range data by minimizing the objective function. Second, the best model is selected according to the minimum residual. The objective functions studied previously by several researchers were strictly concerned with the first purpose <ref> [ 12, 45, 51, 53 ] </ref> , using a maximum likelihood estimator (L 2 norm). To accomplish the second purpose, the values of the objective function must correctly reflect the difference in size and shape between the object data and the parametric models. <p> For the three regular primitives (ellipsoid, cylinder and cuboid), e (D i ; ~a) is defined as the Euclidean distance from a data point to the model surface along a line passing through the origin O of the model and the data point <ref> [ 51 ] </ref> (see Figure 6). Let ~x s = lD i where l is a scalar and ~x s is the model surface point on the line joining D i and O. A is the distance from D i to O. <p> Raja and Jain demonstrated that geon recovery from superquadrics using single view data is highly dependent on the viewpoint [ 38 ] . Whaite and Ferrie studied a quantitative measure of uncertainty in estimating superquadric parameters from single view data <ref> [ 51 ] </ref> . This measure is proportional to the thickness of the shell of uncertainty, defined to be a region of 3D space that encloses the surface of the fit model and in which there is a given probability that the true surface of the model lies.

Reference-contexts: Most of them are commonly described by a simple geometric term - such as ellipsoid, cuboid, cylinder, cone and pyramid without ambiguity. These shapes are also consistent with the basic forms used by the more traditional methods of 3D object representation such as sculpture <ref> [ 54 ] </ref> . The difference between parametric geons and Biederman's geon properties are given in Table 1. Certain qualitative properties of parametric geons are simplified in comparison to the original geons of Biederman's.
