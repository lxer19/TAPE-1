Abstract: In the late 1980s, we developed one of the early case-based design systems called Kritik. Kritik autonomously generated preliminary (conceptual, qualitative) designs for physical devices by retrieving and adapting past designs stored in its case memory. Each case in the system had an associated structure-behavior-function (SBF) device model that explained how the structure of the device accomplished its functions. These casespecific device models guided the process of modifying a past design to meet the functional specification of a new design problem. The device models also enabled verification of the design modifications. Kritik2 is a new and more complete implementation of Kritik. In this paper, we take a retrospective view on Kritik. In early papers, we had described Kritik as integrating case-based and model-based reasoning. In this integration, Kritik also grounds the computational process of case-based reasoning in the SBF content theory of device comprehension. The SBF models not only provide methods for many specific tasks in case-based design such as design adaptation and verification, but they also provide the vocabulary for the whole process of case-based design, from retrieval of old cases to storage of new ones. This grounding, we believe, is essential for building well-constrained theories of case-based design.

Reference-contexts: We have built a growing family of systems for evaluating the integrated theory along many of these dimensions. 5.1. COMPUTATIONAL FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY Kritik <ref> (Goel, 1989, 1991a, 1991b, 1992) </ref> and Kritik2 (Bhatta and Goel, 1992; Stroulia and Goel 1992; Stroulia et al., 1992) are working systems that integrate case-based and model-based reasoning for designing physical devices just as described here. These systems demonstrate that the integrated theory is computationally feasible.
