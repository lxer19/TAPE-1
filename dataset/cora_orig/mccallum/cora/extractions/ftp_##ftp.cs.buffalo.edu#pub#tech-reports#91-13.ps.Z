Abstract: This report describes an interface between ARC/INFO, a geographic information management system, and SNACTor, the SNePS acting component. It also shows a small example interaction that demonstrates how ARC/INFO and SNACTor can interact using the new interface, and how more sophisticated future applications can make use of its functionality. The interface was designed and implemented during a two-month research project carried out in Summer, 1990 at the State University of

Reference-contexts: This can be done by editing pathname variables in files that will be described below. 3.1.2 The ARC/INFO side The ARC/INFO side of the communication makes use of AML, the Arc Macro Language <ref> [1] </ref>. AML provides control constructs and a variety of functions that allow one to write programs containing arbitrary ARC/INFO commands. These programs can be run inside ARC/INFO just as ordinary commands (UNIX shell scripts provide a similar mechanism).
