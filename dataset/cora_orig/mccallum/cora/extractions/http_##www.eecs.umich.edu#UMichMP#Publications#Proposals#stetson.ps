Reference-contexts: Clock skew is most important between sequentially adjacent re gisters. A sequentially adjacent pair of registers is defined as two registers between which lie only combinational logic and interconnect. A formal definition for clock sk ew given by Friedman in <ref> [1] </ref> is repeated below. <p> The timing requirements involved in the clock distrib ution network make its design a very difficult one. In fact, system level tradeoffs between system speed, ph ysical die area, and power dissipation are significantly affected by the design of the clock distrib ution network <ref> [1] </ref>. This section discusses some traditional methods for global clock distrib ution design and their characteristics in terms of clock sk ew, power, and jitter. By far the most common method for distributing clock signals in VLSI applications is the clock tree method.

Reference-contexts: These timing constraints will be fully explored in section 3.3. In order to minimize clock skew, it is first necessary to understand the sources of clock sk ew. Wann and Franklin reported the follo wing sources of clock skew in <ref> [2] </ref>: 1. differences in line lengths from the clock source to the clocked register; 2. differences in delays of any active buffers within the clock distribution network; 3. differences in passive interconnect parame ters, such as line resistivity, dielectric constant and thickness, via/contact resistance, line and fringing capacitance, and line dimensions;

Reference-contexts: Ignoring the clock skew term in equation (2), it is apparent that the maximum attainable frequenc y in a system is that gi ven by the inverse of the longest path delay between an y two sequentially adjacent registers R F and R I <ref> [3] </ref>. If the arri val of the clock signal at R F leads that of R I then positive clock skew exists. Positive clock skew serves to increase the path delay as sho wn in equation (2). This increase in path delay decreases the maximum clock frequency, decreasing performance.

Reference-contexts: This does not eliminate the chip-to-chip or on-chip clock skew due to passive device variations and interconnect delay <ref> [6] </ref>. These important advantages to PLL clock generation do not come without a price. A PLL, unless designed completely from digital circuitry, is essentially an analog circuit, and requires v ery careful design. <p> This section will o verview a few common clocking schemes, their timing requirements, and their associated register designs. Much of the following discussion (particularly the equations) are adapted from similar discussions in Bakoglu <ref> [6] </ref>. Single-phase clocking is characterized by a re g-ister element that is transparent for one phase of the clock signal.

Dobberpuhl, et al., </author> <title> A 200-MHz 64-b Dual Issue CMOS Microprocessor, </title> <journal> IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, </journal> <volume> Vol. SC-27, No. 11, </volume> <pages> pp. 1555-1565, </pages> <month> November </month> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: The mesh structure places the interconnect resistance in parallel, reducing the effective resistance seen by the buffers. This minimizes both the delay through the clock distribution and the total sk ew within it <ref> [7] </ref>. Furthermore, the inputs to pre vious buffer stages were strapped together to smooth an y asymmetric arrival times of the clock signal. <p> One has only to look at the progression of DECs Alpha microprocessor from the 21064 to 21264 to witness this f act. In 1992 DEC reported the 21064 to have an operating frequency of 200 MHz and a po wer supply voltage of 3.3 V <ref> [7] </ref>. In 1994 the 21164 had a frequenc y of 300 MHz (though the power supply voltage remained the same) [21]. Recently, the 21264 was reported to have an operating frequency of 433 MHz and a power supply voltage of 2.0 V [22].

Reference-contexts: Considering the additional interconnect capacitance (which leads to increased power dissipation), the benefits of zero clock sk ew may not be worthy of the price. In f act, the use of an H-tree structure is often overkill for even current generation microprocessors <ref> [8] </ref>. Even if sequentially adjacent re gisters are located on opposite sides of a chip, the concept of tolerable skew routing seems more ef fective. Allowing a measure of clock sk ew between registers significantly relaxes wiring constraints. This relaxation reduces overall interconnect capacitance and power dissipation.

Reference-contexts: The 21164 is a 16.5 mm x 18.1 mm chip with 3.75 nF of capacitance on the clock net. With an operating frequency of 300 MHz and a po wer supply of 3.3 V, the clock distribution dissipates 65% of the chips 50 W <ref> [9, 21] </ref>. In todays microprocessor designs the total power dissipation is a major concern. The present trends quickly result in po wer dissipations that complicate system-level design. For this reason a lot of attention is being focussed on reducing the processors total power dissipation, including that of the clock distribution. <p> This method is used to significant gain on the DEC StrongARM microprocessor. It is estimated that conditional clocking reduced the po wer dissipation of the StrongARMs clock network almost fourfold <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.3 JITTER Increasing clock frequencies reveal a problem that has been previously considered negligible. A general designers rule of thumb is that 10% of the clock period is allocated to clock sk ew. <p> Since the output of the PLL is in-phase with the input, if the clock distribution buffers are included Table 1: Calculated or Simulated Contributions to Peak-to-Peak Jitter for the DEC StrongARM Processor PLL at 320 MHz and 1.35 V <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> Evaluating equation 10, with values obtained by averaging HSPICE results o ver many cycles of operation, yields a phase jitter contrib ution due to transistor noise of about 2 ps. This is less than the results reported in <ref> [9] </ref> because this design s power dissipation was higher. <p> This design resulted in an incredibly lo w maximum clock skew of 80 ps across the 16.5 mm x 18.1 mm die. However, the price for this performance w as the dissipation of nearly 65% of the processor s 50W of power in the clock distribution network <ref> [9, 21] </ref>. The primary goal in clock distrib ution design has traditionally been to transmit the clock signal to every register in the system at precisely the same time. Many routing algorithms exist for attaining zero clock skew, some more effective than others. <p> In fact, it is estimated that the 15% of the chip power that is dissipated in the clock netw ork could have quadrupled without the use of g ated clocks <ref> [9] </ref>. Recent research has reported other applications for gated clocks. In 1995 Benini and De Mecheli re port ed a m et hod of de sig nin g f ini te sta t e machines that takes advantage of self-loops within the FSM to gate the clock.

Recalling that dynamic power dissipation is proportional to V 2 , it is readily apparent that routing two half-swing pairs of clock signals results in approximately 50% the po wer dissipation of one pair of fullswing clock signals.

Reference-contexts: The effect of these noise sources on the reception of the clock signal can be estimated using the f irst crossing approximation as illustrated by Figure 4 <ref> [24] </ref>. The first crossing approximation makes the simplification that subsequent stages in a series of gates begin to switch when their input crosses a particular switching voltage. <p> Considering the states of transistors M2 and M4 for these tw o regions, the average R eff over a full cycle of operation is approximated by . Step three involves the use of the first crossing approximation to relate the total noise v oltage to the timing jitter variance <ref> [24] </ref>. The first crossing approximation assumes that the follo wing stage starts switching when its input crosses its switching voltage.

Reference-contexts: Since I in changes from zero to some maximum value very quickly, the hysteresis has little effect, but by varying I ref , the delay through the inverter can be controlled. 3.1.1.2 Phase Jitter Derivation Adopting the procedure in Weigandt <ref> [25] </ref>, the derivation proceeds in the following steps: 1. Determine the stage delay, t d ; 2. Find equivalent noise generators; 3. Relate voltage noise to jitter with first crossing approximation; 4. Determine inter-stage interaction; 5. Extend jitter of single stage to ring oscillator; 6. <p> Called phase noise, this quantity represents the amount of noise po wer being contributed by a frequency f m away from the center frequency f o . Since the form of (10) is v ery similar to that reported in Weigandt <ref> [25] </ref>, the gen eral form for the phase noise equation was adopted.

Previous designs have adhered to a single chip-wide maximum clock skew budget. For many local data paths this constraint is unnecessary. As synchronous designs become more complex, the next step is to e xtend the tolerable-skew criteria to a finer granularity.

Reference-contexts: Following sections will detail methods of clock network design aimed at minimizing the sk ew. Many routing algorithms e xist for creating both zeroskew and tolerable-skew networks <ref> [27, 33, 34] </ref>. Figure 3 illustrates two examples of zeroskew routing. The H-tree method matches delays by starting at the clock source and branching out in a series of H-shaped structures designed to produce equal length paths to the re gisters [34]. <p> Figure 3 illustrates two examples of zeroskew routing. The H-tree method matches delays by starting at the clock source and branching out in a series of H-shaped structures designed to produce equal length paths to the re gisters <ref> [34] </ref>. The binary tree method designates the re gisters as leaves and the clock source as the root and recursi vely traverses from the leaves back towards the root to attain equal route lengths [33]. Previous designs have adhered to a single chip-wide maximum clock skew budget.
