Title: WAN-hacking with AutoHack Auditing security behind the firewall  
Author: Alec Muffett

Abstract: This paper is a review of an ongoing project to simplify security auditing of the world-wide tcp/ip network of some thirty thousand hosts, internal to Sun Microsystems. The paper also examines the issues which this project raises; it details the conception, design, development of, and one year's results gathered from, Auto-Hack, a tool specially created to probe, audit, and produce security reports for, a tcp/ip network of this size.

Reference-contexts: We had noted (some months previously) that many www hypertext daemons indicate their make and version number in the html document that they produce in response to an illegal request <ref> [BL93] </ref>. Partly because this sort of information is often interesting for its own sake, and partly because the probe was so easy to create (Figure 3), the http probe was added to the suite on the "off-chance" that the data it collected might eventually prove useful. It did.

Reference-contexts: Although this relieves much of the stress placed upon administration staff, the "unthinkable" question remains: What if someone breaks through the firewall? The trouble with firewalls: : : Firewalling <ref> [CB94, Ran93] </ref> your system from the Internet (or otherwise partitioning your network by setting up internal firewalls) brings many problems, possibly the worst of which is that the presence of a firewall encourages slackness on the "secure" side of the network.

Reference-contexts: A configurable network probing tool, capable of digesting information from separate attack modules, generating reports as it goes. The first problem with Satan, however, was that the software was not generally available at the time when this project began 3 . It also appeared <ref> [Far94] </ref> that the upcoming software wasn't exactly suited to our needs. Rather than large-scale auditing and report generation, Satan appears to be aimed at investigation of the "web of trust" in network security, building a dependency graph that lists which machines trust which other machines, to some finite tree depth.

Reference-contexts: However, not long after the initial release, ISS became a commercial product, and we chose not to pursue investigation of it any further. Satan, as described by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema <ref> [FV92] </ref> sounded immensely suited to our needs.

Reference-contexts: It has been necessary in some cases to write code to probe and collect this data. So it is with ripprobe, a small script which sends a rip <ref> [Hed88] </ref> enquiry packet to a machine's routed (or similar) and receives in return a dump of the machine's routing table, which is then sorted by network metric and written to stdout.
