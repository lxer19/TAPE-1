Abstract: We describe a technique for using the joint occurrence of local features at multiple resolutions to measure the similarity between texture images. Though superficially similar to a number of Gabor style techniques, which recognize textures through the extraction of multi-scale feature vectors, our approach is derived from an accurate generative model of texture, which is explicitly multi-scale and non-parametric. The resulting recognition procedure is similarly non-parametric, and can model complex non-homogeneous textures. We report results on publicly available texture databases. In addition, experiments indicate that this approach may have sufficient discrimination power to perform target detection in synthetic aperture radar images (SAR).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the generation of nearby pixels will be strongly dependent. In a related approach a similar arrangement of generative chains has been termed a Markov tree <ref> (Basseville et al., 1992) </ref>. In previous work we have demonstrated that textures generated by sampling from the above distri bution are of very high quality.

Reference-contexts: In their most general form, reasoning with MRFs can require vast amounts computation, often causing convergence to be infeasibly slow. The complexity of generic MRFs is largely eliminated if the conditional distributions are assumed to be Gaussian. Such a process is called a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) <ref> (Chellappa and Chat-terjee, 1985) </ref>. The conditional distributions which define a GMRF can be estimated from the correlations between pixels.

Reference-contexts: Formally, typical images are those whose entropy is approximately the same as the entropy of the class to which they belong. The fact that most images are typical is known as the Asymptotic Equipartition Property <ref> (Cover and Thomas, 1991) </ref>. A better way to decide which of these two images was generated by the above process is to measure which is more typical. This is done using the Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence or cross-entropy 3 .

Reference-contexts: Further, by building the distribution in a non-parametric fashion, it can be complex and multimodal, allowing it to simultaneously capture different types of local structure. In earlier work we showed how textures could be synthesized from such a distribution <ref> (De Bonet, 1997) </ref>. Here we show how to use these distributions to measure the cross-entropy between texture images. In tests of discrimination using simple texture sets, performance is slightly better than standard techniques such as GMRFs.

Reference-contexts: In this way the model can capture both the bricks and the space between them in a single distribution. 1.1 Probabilistic Modeling The probabilistic modeling of images is an endeavor which reaches back to the 60's and 70's <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. The allure of statistical approaches is that they provide a unified view of model estimation, classification and generation.

Reference-contexts: However, it is unlikely that this result is statistically significant. On the MeasTex lattice test suite, which contains textures which are highly non-Gaussian, our approach achieved 96% correct classification while a Gabor Convolution Energy method achieved 89% and GMRF's achieve only 79% <ref> (Fogel and Sagi, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, many approaches have shown good performance with limited classes of textures. Perhaps the most influential statistical model for generic images is the Markov random field (MRF) <ref> (Geman and Geman, 1984) </ref>. MRFs can be used to describe a very wide variety of image distributions using information about local regularities between pixels.

Reference-contexts: the assumption that each of the feature responses is statistically independent a much stronger, and more limiting assumption a texture class can be modeled with the distribution: p fl These insights have been used for noise reduction (Donoho and Johnstone, 1993; Simoncelli and Adel-son, 1996), and example driven texture synthesis <ref> (Heeger and Bergen, 1995) </ref>. Essentially, these approaches assume that natural images are caused by the independent cooccurence of wavelet features. The assumption of independence makes these approaches tractable, but it is also their main weakness.
