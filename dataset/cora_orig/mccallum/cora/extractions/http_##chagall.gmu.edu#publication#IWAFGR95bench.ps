Abstract: We describe herein FERET - a major R&D program aimed at advancing the state-of-the-art in automated face recognition. We address three complementary problems: (A) development of a representative data base set of facial images to train, test, and evaluate alternative face recognition schemes; (B) bench marking of both simple but well known algorithms, and of novel automated and integrated face recognition schemes; and (C) training and testing of human subjects to evaluate human performance using the same data base developed to test the automated face recognition component. The major results of our R&D program indicate that (i) future advances in automated face recognition are predicated on the development of hybrid recognition systems, (ii) that holistic (connectionist) methods outperform discrete (and direct) feature and correlation methods, (iii) that if the test beds are random and contextual cues are lacking human performance is quite poor, not consistent, and degrades rapidly when compared with machine performance, and (iv) that extensive and proper testing is crucial for bench marking.
