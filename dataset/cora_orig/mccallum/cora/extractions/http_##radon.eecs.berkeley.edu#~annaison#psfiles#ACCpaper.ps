Abstract: Table 1 summarizes the results of several design iterations. Each row represents a design iteration corresponding to a particular weighting function W perf , which in turn is specified by the variables listed at the top of was able to achieve a 5 dB attenuation bandwidth of 590 Hz from 150 Hz to 740 Hz. Disturbance attenuation levels of up to 110 dB over a narrow bandwidth (between 120 Hz and 145 Hz) were attainable for this very small uncertainty level. Of course, the cost of this gain in performance is a decreased level of robustness. The results for this 0.1% uncertainty level are presented in Table 2. TABLE 1.

Conclusions In this study, we applied recent developments in optimal control theory and in particular, -synthesis and analysis techniques to determine the limits on performance achievable by an ANC headphone system. An identification procedure was conducted and validated to estimate a plant model for use in the design of a robust control law. Furthermore, a systematic method to determine performance limits in terms of disturbance attenuation levels and attenuation bandwidths was developed using the Matlab -Analysis and Synthesis Toolbox. It was found that performance in terms of disturbance attenuation levels and attenuation bandwidths was maximized by focusing on a slightly higher frequency range, from 70 Hz to 250 Hz, rather than on the lower end of the target range beginning at 40 Hz. Robustness was a key issue in this design process. A robust performance objective was incorporated into the design process through the choice of weighting functions in the -framework. In this paper we considered uncertainty levels set at some constant value in the lower frequency range, and approaching 100% uncertainty in the higher frequency range where the model was no longer a good representation of the plant. The design could be improved by acquiring more specific knowledge regarding the nature of the actual uncertainty in the system and advantage of the systematic method used here is that this new information can be readily accommodated and the resulting control law can be upgraded accordingly. incorporating this into the uncertainty weighting function.
