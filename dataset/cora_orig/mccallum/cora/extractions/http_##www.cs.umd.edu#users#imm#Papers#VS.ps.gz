Abstract: In this paper, we present a scalable VC routing protocol. It is based on the recently proposed viewserver hierarchy, where each viewserver maintains a partial view of the network. By querying these viewservers, a source can obtain a merged view that contains a path to the destination. The source then sends a request packet over this path to setup a real-time VC through resource reservations. The request is blocked if the setup fails. We compare our protocol to a simple approach using simulation. Under this simple approach, a source maintains a full view of the network. In addition to the savings in storage, our results indicate that our protocol performs close to or better than the simple approach in terms of VC carried load and blocking probability over a wide range of real-time workload. fl This work is supported in part by ARPA and Philips Labs under contract DASG60-92-0055 to Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme In this paper, we present a scalable VC routing scheme that does not suffer from the problems of areas. Our scheme is based on the viewserver hierarchy we recently proposed in <ref> [3, 2] </ref> for large internetworks and evaluated for administrative policy constraints. Here, we are concerned with the support of performance/QoS requirements in large wide-area ATM-like networks, and we adapt our viewserver protocols accordingly. In our scheme, views are not maintained by every end-system but by special switches called viewservers. <p> Surprisingly, at high values of , all the viewserver schemes perform better than the simple approach. At = 0:5, the network with the base scheme carries about 30% higher load than the simple approach. This is an interesting result. Our explanation is as follows. Elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>, we have found that when the viewserver schemes can not find an existing feasible path, this path is usually very long (more than 11 hops). This causes our viewserver hierarchy protocols to reject VCs that are admitted by the simple approach over long paths.

Thus, views in our viewserver schemes will be more up-to-date. As we pointed out in <ref> [3] </ref>, the only drawback of our protocol is that to obtain a source route for a VC, views are merged at (or prior to) the VC setup, thereby increasing the setup time.

Reference-contexts: This requires a transport protocol support such as TCP [23]. To implement both kind of sends, we assume there is a reserved VC on each link for sending routing, signaling and control messages <ref> [4] </ref>. This also ensures that routing messages do not degrade the QoS seen by applications. Views and Viewservers Views are maintained by special nodes called viewservers. Each viewserver has a precinct, which is a set of nodes around the viewserver.

Reference-contexts: One approach to solve this problem is to install fewer VPs and thus use longer paths (i.e. consisting of more than two VPs).

Reference-contexts: Thus, admission tests have to be done on at most two links resulting in small VC setup times.

Also, the static allocation of resources to VPs can result in resource under-utilization and higher blocking probabilities [17].

Reference-contexts: In the viewserver hierarchy, a viewserver maintains (in its view) routes to the nodes in its precinct. A number of VC routing schemes have also been designed for networks that use the Virtual Path (VP) concept <ref> [17, 16] </ref>. This VP concept has been proposed to achieve scaling and simplify network management and control. Typically, a VP is installed between two nodes over a sequence of physical links.
