Title: Analyzing Teams of Cooperating Mobile Robots

Abstract: In [Don4], we described a manipulation task for cooperating mobile robots that can push large, heavy objects. There, we asked whether explicit local and global communication between the agents can be removed from a family of pushing protocols. In this paper, we answer in the affirmative. We do so by using the general methods of [Don4] analyzing information invariants. We discuss several measures for the information complexity of the task of pushing with cooperating mobile robots, and we present a methodology for creating new manipulation strategies out of existing ones. We develop and analyze synchronous and asynchronous manipulation protocols for a small team of cooperating mobile robots than can push large boxes. The protocols we describe have been implemented in several forms on the Cornell mobile robots in our laboratory.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, our task is in some ways closer in flavor to dynamic manipulation [ML], even though the box dynamics are essentially quasi-static. We develop a framework for analysis and synthesis, based on information invariants <ref> [Don4] </ref>, to reveal these assumptions and expose the information structure of the task. We believe our theory has implications for the parallelization of manipulation tasks on spatially distributed teams of cooperating robots. <p> Hor-swill [Hors] has developed a semantics for sensory systems that models and quantifies the kinds of assumptions a sensori-computational program makes about its environment. He also gives source-to-source transformations on sensori-computational "circuits." The paper <ref> [Don4] </ref> discusses the semantics of sensor systems. This formalism is used to explore some properties of what we call situated sensor systems and describes a way to transform sensori-computational systems. <p> We foreground the task of pushing an object, using two communicating robots who need to infer the position of the first moment of the friction distribution with respect to their lines of pushing (see Figure 1a). We present, analyze and compare three pusing protocols using the tools introduced in <ref> [Don4] </ref>. We do so by rigorously comparing embedded sensori-computational systems, under the notion of reduction, which attempts to quantify when we can "efficiently" build one sensor out of another. We also sketch a general methodology for developing distributed manipulation protocols. <p> We can get a deeper understanding of the relationship between these protocols by attempting to "transform" or "reduce" one to the other. We do so below. 3 Reductions and Transformations We present here a very brief summary of our model of sensori-computational systems, which we view as "circuits." (See <ref> [Don4] </ref> for a full treatment of these concepts.) We model the circuits as graphs. <p> We may define + on two immersed graphs whenever the immersions are compatible. An immersion of G and an immersion of G 0 are said to be compatible when the two immersions agree 5 Class edge permutation leaves unchanged the complexity bounds and the lemmas of <ref> [Don4] </ref>. on the intersection V " V 0 (for total immersions) or more generally, on 1 C " 1 C (for partial functions).

Calibration complexity, defined formally in [Don4], measures how much information we add to a sensor system when we install and calibrate it. Installing a sensor system may require physically establishing some spatial relation between two components of the system. In this case we say the two components codesignate by the spatial relation. <p> It does not appear to be transitive. The reduction fl (Definition 3.8) is a "0-wire" reduction. It is transitive for simple sensor systems <ref> [Don4] </ref>. We could analogously define a k-wire reduction k by modifying the equation in definition 3.10 to read S fl Q + k comm (S), where k comm (S) denotes k times z -| - comm (S) + + comm (S). 6 See proof in [Don4]. 4 Comparing Protocols Using Reductions <p> transitive for simple sensor systems <ref> [Don4] </ref>.

Theorem 4.1 Let P.II, P.I (QS), odom, and be the sen sor systems defined as above. <p> It is somewhat surprising that we can in fact automate this process: <ref> [Don4] </ref> gives algorithms for deciding the relation 1 . More precisely, given suitable encodings of two sensor systems S and U , we can computa-tionally decide whether S 1 U [Don4].

Figure 1a depicts one robot (the reader should picture a robot manipulator, or gripper) executing this task. <p> In our laboratory, multiple mobile robots are executing these strategies and others for both pushing and reorientation of large objects <ref> [DJR] </ref>. In analyzing the results of our experiments, we have demonstrated precise equivalences between different types of sensing, communication, and internal and external state, by reducing one sensor system to another; the nature of these equivalences is conditioned by the task.

Reference-contexts: The boxes are typically several robot diameters wide, and 1-2 times the mass of a single robot, although the robots have also pushed couches that are heavier (perhaps 2-4 times the mass, and 8 fi 3 robot diameters in size). We build on the ground-breaking work of <ref> [Mason, EM] </ref> and others on planar sensorless manipulation. Our work differs from previous work on pushing in several ways. First, the robots and boxes are on a similar dynamic and spatial scale.

Finally, the pushing literature generally regards the "pushers" as moving kinematic constraints.

The x axis is parallel to the direction of pushing p. <p> Moreover, we observe that the tangent function is monotonic and sign preserving; this means we can adapt the control system to servo on instead of , without knowing r. Specifically, the robots measure 0 (the initial angle between n and p; see <ref> [JR] </ref>), and compare this value to the angle (t) measured at time t in order to infer the direction of motion of the box. The sign of the change in this angle defines the sense of the rotation of the box.

Reference-contexts: The robot consists of two rigidly connected fingers L and R; for example, they could be the fingers of a parallel-jaw gripper. One complication involves the micro-mechanical variations in the slip of the box on the table <ref> [Mas] </ref>. This phenomenon is very hard to model, and hence it is difficult to predict the results of a one-fingered push; we will only obtain a straight-line trajectory when the center of friction (COF) lies on the line of pushing.
