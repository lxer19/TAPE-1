Abstract: It has long been observed by researchers in data mining that induction, deduction, and guidance are all necessary components for an effective discovery system. However, most extant integrated systems use only external guidance | they rely solely on humans to determine search directions and select data analysis tools, yet provide little assistance to humans in these activities. In this paper, we describe an integrated data mining system based on matepatterns (also known as metaqueries) that utilizes not only external human guidance but also internal guidance of inter-component dependencies. It provides helpful feedback to humans for choosing fruitful discovery directions, and when instructed by the user, it can automatically discover relational patterns directly from databases. The system goes beyond the existing Machine Learning technologies, and it can learn relational patterns without requiring humans to pre-label the data as positive or negative examples for some given target concepts. With this technology, future data mining systems can discover higher quality, human comprehensible knowledge in a much more efficient and focused manner, and data mining can be managed easily by both expert and less expert users.

Reference-contexts: Finding circles in a graph can be accomplished by using a standard transitive closure algorithm (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>) with some simple augmentation to enforce the alternating edge constraint. A graph G cannot have more than jGj! circles because a circle, without duplicated nodes, cannot be longer than the size of the graph.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms represent the efforts to integrate static domain knowledge with induction. The researchers in inductive logical programming have also addressed the problem of learning relation-based patterns. Different from the algorithms described above, these programs (see for example <ref> [2, 14, 17] </ref>) are focused on inventing new predicates from positive and negative training examples. Some of them (for example [16]) also use semantic knowledge as guidance. Our research in this area is focused on discovering relation-based patterns from data that are commonly found in databases.

Reference-contexts: On the one hand, most algorithms that learn relational patterns, see for example [19, 17], require humans to label the data as positive and negative examples for a given target concept. On the other hand, most unsupervised algorithms, see for example <ref> [27, 30, 28, 13, 3] </ref>, hardly go beyond learning attribute-based concepts. This paper describes a recent progress towards using both external and internal guidance in integrated data mining systems. The basic idea is to extend the metapattern-based, human-directed discovery loop with a metapattern generator. <p> Furthermore, due to the nature of data mining, the domain and semantic knowledge must be incorporated interactively as the discovery loop iterates; they cannot be predetermined at the offset of the application. Although there are existing systems (see for example <ref> [27, 30, 28, 13, 3] </ref>) in the literature that can perform unsupervised learning, most of them are not targeted to learning relation-based patterns directly from databases. <p> Although RDT can learn concepts, it needs pre-labeled examples. LABYRINTH [28] incrementally forms concepts on composite objects, while KLUSTER [13] constructively induces structural knowledge on term-subsumption formalisms. Both systems produce concept hierarchy which is a different representation from function-free Horn clauses. Finally, KBG <ref> [3] </ref> is a knowledge based generalizer in a first order logic representation. It forms generalization tree, rather than implication rules, from a set of examples, each of which is a collection of tuples, by iterative use of clustering and generalization.

Reference-contexts: Humans will not need to specify which hypotheses and examples to learn; nor will it be necessary to preclassify the items in databases as positive or negative. Furthermore, just like the latest developments in this field (see for example, <ref> [10] </ref>), our patterns have estimated statistical significance for reflecting the characteristics of the data (such as exceptions and noise); and our mechanism has built-in connections to real databases and can accept human guidance interactively during the discovery process. This research has also revealed several important directions for future research.

Reference-contexts: They will also serve as the evolutionary basis for the development of more fruitful metapatterns. Metapatterns and the human-directed discovery loop are currently implemented in a system called DataCrystal, described in [25, 26]. The deductive part of DataCrystal contains a metapattern instantiator and a deductive database technology called LDL++ <ref> [18, 29] </ref>. The instantiator generates a set of LDL++ rules from a metapattern. These rules are then used by LDL++ to access various types of relational databases. The inductive part of DataCrystal includes a set of inductive data analysis tools that implement the above metapattern actions and a pattern constructor.

Reference-contexts: All these dependencies must be supported by a common representation so that sharing knowledge, hypotheses, and tasks will be possible.

The metapattern-based, human-directed discovery loop has already been successfully applied to several real-world applications. These include discovering regularities in a large, common-sense knowledge base <ref> [22] </ref>, finding circuit patterns from a telecommunication database [25], building prediction models from a chemical research database [26], constructing fault detection rules from a database that contains sequences of control data for semiconduct chip manufacture [24], discovering association rules in databases [6], and detecting consuming patterns in retail [12]. <p> In essence, it subsumes many other types of metapatterns, such as implication, inheritance, transfers through, and functional dependency (see <ref> [22] </ref> for details). In this section, we describe an algorithm to generate the set of all possible transitivity metapatterns for a given database. We believe that similar algorithms can be designed to generate other types of general metapatterns such as MP-2 or MP-3 in Section 3.1.

Metapatterns and the human-directed discovery loop are currently implemented in a system called DataCrystal, described in <ref> [25, 26] </ref>. The deductive part of DataCrystal contains a metapattern instantiator and a deductive database technology called LDL++ [18, 29]. The instantiator generates a set of LDL++ rules from a metapattern. These rules are then used by LDL++ to access various types of relational databases. <p> At present, the action classify is a high-performance incremental algorithm called CDL2 [23] for learning decision lists from data. The action cluster is a Bayesian-based Cobweb clustering algorithm <ref> [5, 26] </ref>. The action ComputeStrength is an LDL++ procedure, the Plot action is a powerful GnuPlot tool, and the regression action is a standard polynomial interpolation method. <p> The metapattern-based, human-directed discovery loop has already been successfully applied to several real-world applications. These include discovering regularities in a large, common-sense knowledge base [22], finding circuit patterns from a telecommunication database [25], building prediction models from a chemical research database <ref> [26] </ref>, constructing fault detection rules from a database that contains sequences of control data for semiconduct chip manufacture [24], discovering association rules in databases [6], and detecting consuming patterns in retail [12].

Reference-contexts: On the one hand, most algorithms that learn relational patterns, see for example [19, 17], require humans to label the data as positive and negative examples for a given target concept. On the other hand, most unsupervised algorithms, see for example <ref> [27, 30, 28, 13, 3] </ref>, hardly go beyond learning attribute-based concepts. This paper describes a recent progress towards using both external and internal guidance in integrated data mining systems. The basic idea is to extend the metapattern-based, human-directed discovery loop with a metapattern generator. <p> Furthermore, due to the nature of data mining, the domain and semantic knowledge must be incorporated interactively as the discovery loop iterates; they cannot be predetermined at the offset of the application. Although there are existing systems (see for example <ref> [27, 30, 28, 13, 3] </ref>) in the literature that can perform unsupervised learning, most of them are not targeted to learning relation-based patterns directly from databases. <p> These systems differ from ours in several aspects, including the goal and context of learning, ways of learning (incremental or constructive), and the form of the final concepts. CLUSTER/S <ref> [27] </ref> performs goal-oriented classification on structured objects by using two methods. The first is concept formation by repeated discrimination which requires both positive and negative examples. The second is concept formation by finding classifying 4 attributes.

MOBAL requires some rules to start with which are not available in a database. Although RDT can learn concepts, it needs pre-labeled examples. LABYRINTH <ref> [28] </ref> incrementally forms concepts on composite objects, while KLUSTER [13] constructively induces structural knowledge on term-subsumption formalisms. Both systems produce concept hierarchy which is a different representation from function-free Horn clauses. Finally, KBG [3] is a knowledge based generalizer in a first order logic representation.

This method attempts to find one or more classifying attributes whose value sets can be split into ranges that define individual classes. It is not clear how this method could learn the relationships among the given attributes. MOBAL <ref> [30] </ref> regards concept formation as a process of forming extensional aggregates of objects and then characterizing these aggregates with an intensional definition. Given a knowledge base of facts and rules that may be overly general, MOBAL uses its knowledge revision tool (KRT) to correct those overly general rules.
