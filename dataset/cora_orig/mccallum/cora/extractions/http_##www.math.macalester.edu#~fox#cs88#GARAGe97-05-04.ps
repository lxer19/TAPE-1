Abstract: This paper presents an approach to optimal design of elastic flywheels using an Injection Island Genetic Algorithm (iiGA). An iiGA in combination with a finite element code is used to search for shape variations to optimize the Specific Energy Density (SED) of elastic flywheels. SED is defined as the amount of rotational energy stored per unit mass. iiGAs seek solutions simultaneously at different levels of refinement of the problem representation (and correspondingly different definitions of the fitness function) in separate sub-populations (islands). Solutions are sought first at low levels of refinement with an axisymmetric plane stress finite element code for high speed exploration of the coarse design space. Next, individuals are injected into populations with a higher level of resolution that uses an axisymmetric three dimensional finite element model to fine-tune the flywheel designs. In true multi-objective optimization, various sub-fitness functions can be defined that represent good aspects of the overall fitness function. Solutions can be sought for these various sub-fitness functions on different nodes and injected into a node that evaluates the overall fitness. Allowing subpopulations to explore different regions of the fitness space simultaneously allows relatively robust and efficient exploration in problems for which fitness evaluations are costly. This paper will describe the advantages of searching with an axisymmetric plane stress finite element model (with a sub-fitness function) to quickly find building blocks needed to inject into an axisymmetric three-dimensional finite element model through use of an iiGA. An optimal annular composite flywheel shape will be sought by an iiGA and, for comparison, by a ring topology parallel GA. The flywheel is modeled as a series of concentric rings (see Figure 1). The thickness of each ring varies linearly in the radial direction with the possibility for a diverse set of material choices for each ring. Figure 2 shows a typical flywheel model in which symmetry is used to increase computational efficiency. The overall fitness function for the genetic algorithm GALOPPS was the specific energy density (SED) of a flywheel, which is defined as: Recently iiGAs have been successfully applied in the optimization of laminated composite materials [1,2]. An eventual goal of this effort is to develop tools for multidisciplinary optimization of large scale 3-dimensional composite structures. Combining a GA with the finite element method is by now a familiar approach in the optimization of structures, but using an iiGA with multiple evaluation tools and with different fitness functions is a new approach aimed at decreasing computational time while increasing the robustness of a typical GA. Two problems associated with GAs are their need for many fitness evaluations and their propensity to converge prematurely. An approach that ameliorates both of these problems is a parallel GA (PGA), which also produces a more realistic model of nature than a single large population. PGAs both decrease processing time and better explore the search space.
