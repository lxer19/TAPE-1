Reference-contexts: Since there are O (n) insertions, the algorithm takes O (n 2 ) time. The above theorem implies that M inSort Bk 1;n1 () = n jLIS ()j; 1 A more sophisticated process (the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this dissertation) involves AVL trees <ref> [1] </ref> and reduces this step to O (log n) time. This yields a resulting time complexity of O (n log n). 91 CHAPTER 7. BLOCK-MOVES AND THE LIS where jLIS ()j is the length of an LIS in .

Reference-contexts: They observe that selecting block-moves that maximally lengthen the longest increasing subsequence in the permutation appear to produce near-optimal results. It is not yet known whether or not M inSort Bk is NP-complete. Aigner and West <ref> [2] </ref> provide a polynomial-time algorithm for a variant of this problem where the block-moves are restricted to those that re-insert the first element in a permutation. Block-interchanges are generators that switch blocks that are not necessarily adjacent (a generalization of block-moves).

Reference-contexts: Let a be an element in . The restriction [a] is the subsequence in containing all elements a. For example, let = 2 4 1 3 6 5; the restriction <ref> [3] </ref> = 2 1 3. Restrictions generalize to any sequence of integers, not just permutations. That is, given a sequence s of integers and an integer b, the restriction s [b] is the subsequence of s consisting of all elements b. <p> Christie [9] shows that minimum sorting by block-interchanges is solvable in O (n 2 ) time and establishes that the block-interchange diameter of S n equals ffi n Cayley graphs have applications in the study of interconnection networks <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. A pancake network [3, 22] (also called a pancake graph), for instance, corresponds to the Cayley graph G c (P; n) where P [n] is the set of prefix reversals. Gates and Papadimitriou [15] and Heydari and Sudborough [22] provide bounds on the diameter of pancake networks. <p> Christie [9] shows that minimum sorting by block-interchanges is solvable in O (n 2 ) time and establishes that the block-interchange diameter of S n equals ffi n Cayley graphs have applications in the study of interconnection networks [3, 4]. A pancake network <ref> [3, 22] </ref> (also called a pancake graph), for instance, corresponds to the Cayley graph G c (P; n) where P [n] is the set of prefix reversals. Gates and Papadimitriou [15] and Heydari and Sudborough [22] provide bounds on the diameter of pancake networks. <p> Cayley graphs with high symmetry and low degree and diameter are preferable; the pancake network and the hypercube are examples of such graphs. Akers and Krishnamurthy <ref> [3] </ref> show that every symmetric interconnection network corresponds to a Cayley graph for some predicate P . 15 Chapter 4 Reduction Results In this chapter, we show that many bounded problems are at least as difficult as the corresponding unbounded problems. <p> Swaps are an example of generators that are not restriction-preserving as the following example suggests: = 5 3 2 1 4 0 = h2; 5i = 5 4 2 1 3 In this example, there is no swap 0 such that 0 <ref> [3] </ref> = [3] 0 . The following theorem generalizes the results in the previous section. Recall that given a predicate P , P ` is just the predicate P with an additional distance bound `. <p> Swaps are an example of generators that are not restriction-preserving as the following example suggests: = 5 3 2 1 4 0 = h2; 5i = 5 4 2 1 3 In this example, there is no swap 0 such that 0 <ref> [3] </ref> = [3] 0 . The following theorem generalizes the results in the previous section. Recall that given a predicate P , P ` is just the predicate P with an additional distance bound `.

Reference-contexts: Restrictions generalize to any sequence of integers, not just permutations. That is, given a sequence s of integers and an integer b, the restriction s [b] is the subsequence of s consisting of all elements b. For example, let s = 7 2 4 6 3; the restriction s <ref> [4] </ref> = 2 4 3. 11 CHAPTER 2. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND 2.9 Graph Notation This dissertation uses graphs to model the problems we investigate. We use the symbol G to denote a graph. We use the symbol V to denote its vertices. A graph may be directed or undirected. <p> Christie [9] shows that minimum sorting by block-interchanges is solvable in O (n 2 ) time and establishes that the block-interchange diameter of S n equals ffi n Cayley graphs have applications in the study of interconnection networks <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. A pancake network [3, 22] (also called a pancake graph), for instance, corresponds to the Cayley graph G c (P; n) where P [n] is the set of prefix reversals. Gates and Papadimitriou [15] and Heydari and Sudborough [22] provide bounds on the diameter of pancake networks.

Reference-contexts: They describe the equivalence classes of permutations under generators of this type. They also introduce the problem of determining the m-reversal diameter for circular permutations and provide upper and lower bounds for this diameter. Bafna and Pevzner <ref> [5] </ref> study minimum sorting by block-moves (M inSort Bk ) and provide a metric on a permutation that counts cycles in a graph representation of the permutation. <p> Determining the value of Diam Sw 3 (n) is a particularly interesting open problem (see Section 8.5). The diameter for swaps is easily derived; the diameter for reversals is known [6]; and, a conjecture for the diameter of block-moves is available <ref> [5] </ref>. We have tabulated Diam Sw 3 (n) for small n and have not been able to find a pattern to make a reasonable conjecture for the short swap diameter of S n .

Reference-contexts: Investigating bounded M inSort P and Diam P problems is useful as it gives us a more complete understanding of the computational complexity of these problems in general. Sorting by unbounded swaps is solvable [23]; sorting by unbounded reversals is NP-complete <ref> [7] </ref>; and sorting by unbounded block-moves remains open. It is interesting theoretically to determine whether the computational complexities of these problems are affected when distance bounds are applied to the problems. <p> Bafna and Pevzner's algorithm, in particular, has a performance guarantee of 1.75. They also show that Diam Rv (n) = n 1. Heath and Vergara [20] test some conjectures on M inSort Rv and provide a mechanism to generate 13 CHAPTER 3. RELATED RESEARCH counterexamples. Caprara <ref> [7] </ref> shows that M inSort Rv is NP-complete. Hannenhalli and Pevzner [19] and Kaplan, Shamir, and Tarjan [25] show that a variant of the problem, sorting signed permutations by reversals, is solvable in polynomial time. <p> Then, M inSort Bk_Rv reduces in polynomial time to M inSort (Bk_Rv) bf (n)c . Furthermore, in light of the result by Caprara <ref> [7] </ref>, where M inSort Rv is shown to be NP-complete, all bounded M inSort Rv variants of this kind are likewise NP-complete. <p> SHORT SWAPS (SHORT REVERSALS) = ((n 1)=2 + 1) + 2 i=(n1)=2+2 (n1)=2 X i n X i 2 i=1 = 2 i=1 (n1)=2 X i 2 i=1 = 2 i=1 = 2 i=1 = (n 2 1)=2 2 : For example, the decreasing permutation ffi <ref> [7] </ref> = 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 has V ffi whose vectors have lengths that are given by jv ffi (7)j = 7 1; jv ffi (6)j = 6 2; jv ffi (5)j = 5 3; jv ffi (4)j = 4 4; and jV ffi j is computed as

Reference-contexts: Heydari [21] shows that this problem is NP-complete. The prefix-reversal diameter of S n is at least 17 16 n [15, 17] and at most 3 2 (n + 1) [22]. Chen and Skiena <ref> [8] </ref> investigate minimum sorting by fixed-length reversals. Here, P [n] is the set of all m-reversals for some fixed m. They describe the equivalence classes of permutations under generators of this type. <p> In determining this value, we seek a permutation that is farthest from the identity permutation. A candidate for such a permutation is the decreasing permutation ffi such as ffi <ref> [8] </ref> = 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. Recall that ffi is a woven bitonic permutation. By Theorem 6.9, Algorithm BitonicSort therefore applies to ffi and returns M inSort Bk 3 (ffi) = djA p j=2e.

Block-interchanges are generators that switch blocks that are not necessarily adjacent (a generalization of block-moves).

Reference-contexts: Other cases identified by Jerrum where M inSort P is solvable in polynomial time are when P describes either swaps, generators that permute any 3 elements, or particular combinations of these generators. Driscoll and Furst <ref> [10] </ref> show that Diam P (n) = O (n 2 ) for the predicates P that describe the generators indicated above and for other general cases for P . Kececioglu and Sankoff [26, 27] and Bafna and Pevzner [6] have results on M inSort Rv and Diam Rv .

Reference-contexts: Most of the work discussed here focuses on a particular predicate P . Even and Goldreich <ref> [11] </ref> show that both M inSort P and Diam P , when P is considered part of the problem instance, are NP-hard. The results are strengthened by Jerrum [23] where he shows that these problems are PSPACE-complete. Jerrum also identifies some cases of M inSort P that are polynomial-time solvable.

Reference-contexts: Minimum sorting by prefix reversals, also known as the pancake problem, is the case where P [n] = f (1; j) j 2 j ng. Heydari [21] shows that this problem is NP-complete. The prefix-reversal diameter of S n is at least 17 16 n <ref> [15, 17] </ref> and at most 3 2 (n + 1) [22]. Chen and Skiena [8] investigate minimum sorting by fixed-length reversals.

Gates and Papadimitriou <ref> [15] </ref> and Heydari and Sudborough [22] provide bounds on the diameter of pancake networks. Determining the diameter of interconnection networks is the same as solving Diam P for the appropriate P .

Reference-contexts: They also conjecture that Diam Bk (n) = ffi n + 1 and prove that it is at least ffi n . Guyer, Heath, and Vergara <ref> [16] </ref> employ some heuristics based on subsequences and devise corresponding algorithms for the problem. They observe that selecting block-moves that maximally lengthen the longest increasing subsequence in the permutation appear to produce near-optimal results. It is not yet known whether or not M inSort Bk is NP-complete. <p> Sorting by block-moves and its bounded variants are of particular interest. For instance, Guyer, Heath, and Vergara <ref> [16] </ref> show experimentally that, for the currently unresolved problem of sorting by unbounded block-moves, the heuristic based on longest increasing subsequences appears to produce near-optimal results. In Section 7.1, we study M inSort Bk 1;n1 , sorting by single element insertions.

Reference-contexts: The computation therefore takes O (n 3 log n) time considering that Algorithm GetActual runs in O (n log n) time. However, line 1 of the algorithm involves obtaining a maximum matching in a graph which takes O (v 2:5 ) <ref> [29] </ref>, where v is the number of vertices in the graph. Noting that v = O (n 2 ), matching takes O (n 5 ) time and, as a result, dominates the running time of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Figure 6.1 illustrates the permutation graph for = 4 2 1 3 6 5. Permutation graphs have been studied extensively (e.g., [31]) and are examples of transitive graphs <ref> [30] </ref>. It can be verified that a correcting short block-move corresponds to the removal of one or two arcs from the corresponding permutation graph. Specifically, a skip corresponds to the removal of a single arc in the graph (an inversion in is eliminated).
