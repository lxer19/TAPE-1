Abstract: We present an algorithm that uses evolutionary computation for the determination of functional links in neural networks. We consider two kinds of functional links; one based on polynomials, and one based on expression trees that are composed of a number of basic functions. The main advantage of functional link networks (compared to multilayer perceptrons trained with the backpropagation learning rule) is that they are easier to train, and that insight may be gained in the problem that it solves. The first kind of functional links is optimized with a genetic algorithm, and the second kind is optimized using genetic programming. The fitness of the functional link networks is obtained from the error rate of the network on a test set.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms more or less related are, amongst others: multilayer networks; neural networks of which the architecture is determined using genetic algorithms; and genetic programming. For an extensive overview of combinations of neural networks and genetic algorithms see <ref> [Bra95] </ref>. Multilayer neural networks can solve equal complex problems (theoretically), but a multilayer neural network does not give insight in the nature of the problem it solves; and since simple perceptrons are linear such is not the case for these networks.

Reference-contexts: The second class consists of functional that are represented by expression trees built of a set of basic operations. We call these functional links operational functional links. 3 Evolutionary Computation Our algorithm determines functional links using evolutionary computation. The selection operation is ranking selection <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. The fitness value equals minus the error of the corresponding network on a test set. An individual represents a number of functional links and thus encodes a complete network.

Reference-contexts: Since there is only one output unit, the algorithm can only be applied for two-class problems; problems with more classes can, however, always be rewritten to a series of two-class problems <ref> [Han81] </ref>. Assume input patterns ~x 2 IR D ; the simple perceptron can solve a linear separable classification problem by defining a plane ~w ~x = 0; patterns on one side of the plane get the same classification.

Reference-contexts: Crossover between two individuals is straightforwardly done by interchanging parts of the strings. Mutation has been implemented as the exchange of a power with a random power. 3.2 Operational functional links For these links we follow the framework of genetic programming <ref> [Koz92] </ref>. An operational functional link is an expression tree constructed with certain 3 basic operations. The basic operations applied are +, , fi, =, ", exp, ln, sin, sin 1 , cos, cos 1 , tan en tan 1 .

Reference-contexts: Mutation of a tree is done by replacing subtrees by random subtrees. Since inconsistent expressions may originate some mathematical operators are protected so that, if an inconsistency occurs, a zero is returned to prevent the algorithm to stuck. 4 Related methods Methods that are related are for example <ref> [KS91] </ref> and [Rog91]. Algorithms more or less related are, amongst others: multilayer networks; neural networks of which the architecture is determined using genetic algorithms; and genetic programming.

Reference-contexts: To improve on point (i) is more diffi cult. These disadvantages do not hold for single layer networks, but a single 1 layer network is more restricted than a multilayer network. To increase the capabilities of single layer networks so-called functional links can be added <ref> [Pao89] </ref>. Functional links transform the input patterns and might simplify the classification problem such that a single layer network can learn the correct classification. However, the choice of the functional links is crucial for this approach to succeed. Our algorithm attempts to determine optimal functional links automatically using evolutionary computation.
