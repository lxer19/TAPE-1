Abstract: Stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) are applied to the problems of folding, aligning and modeling families of tRNA sequences. SCFGs capture the sequences' common primary and secondary structure and generalize the hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in related work on protein and DNA. Results show that after having been trained on as few as 20 tRNA sequences from only two tRNA subfamilies (mitochondrial and cytoplasmic), the model can discern general tRNA from similar-length RNA sequences of other kinds, can find secondary structure of new tRNA sequences, and can produce multiple alignments of large sets of tRNA sequences. Our results suggest potential improvements in the alignments of the D- and T-domains in some mitochdondrial tRNAs that cannot be fitted into the canonical secondary structure.

Reference-contexts: We create a statistical model of tRNA by generating a SCFG incorporating base-pairing information in a manner similar to our construction of an HMM representing a statistical model of a protein family or domain <ref> [19] </ref>. This model is used to discriminate tRNA from other RNAs of similar length, obtain a multiple sequence alignment and ascertain the secondary structure of new tRNAs. The results indicate that the tRNA SCFG model appears to be a good discriminator. <p> If we let a denote any terminal symbol, then these productions can be classified into four types: S ! aSa describe base-pairs 1 We have used HMMs successfully to model protein families and domains <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. Because the standard HMM approach treats all positions as having independent distributions and hence no interactions between positions, they are unsuitable for RNA where, if two positions are base-paired, the bases at these positions may be highly correlated. 2 a. <p> Hence, it is normalized by evaluating a Z-score, which is the difference, measured in standard deviations, between the NLL score of a sequence and the average NLL score of a typical non-tRNA sequence of the same length <ref> [19] </ref>. We use the Z-score to discriminate tRNA sequences from non-tRNA sequences by choosing a Z-score cutoff and classifying sequences above the cutoff as tRNAs. Although it is not clear that the normalized scores actually exhibit Gaussian tails for non-tRNAs, this kind of Gaussian approximation has worked well previously [19]. <p> length <ref> [19] </ref>. We use the Z-score to discriminate tRNA sequences from non-tRNA sequences by choosing a Z-score cutoff and classifying sequences above the cutoff as tRNAs. Although it is not clear that the normalized scores actually exhibit Gaussian tails for non-tRNAs, this kind of Gaussian approximation has worked well previously [19]. CFGs are generally ambiguous because the grammar gives more than one parse tree for a sequence and alternative parse trees reflect alternative secondary structures (foldings). <p> This procedure, which resembles the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs [29], is also used to obtain multiple sequence alignments in a manner similar to that described for HMMs in <ref> [19] </ref>. 2.2 Initial tRNA grammar A tRNA meta-grammar was created using the known structure of tRNA and employed to generate the probabilities and productions for an intial grammar (Figure 2). <p> Each of these meta-terminals itself has a set of productions associated with it (not shown). For a meta-nonterminal loop (n), the grammar generating program creates a subgrammar equivalent to a protein HMM with n match states as in <ref> [19] </ref>, except that the four-letter alphabet of nucleic acids replaces the twenty-letter alphabet of amino acids. This subgrammar derives strings with no base pairs that typically have length n with the distributions of the nucleotides in these strings being defined by the probabilities of the productions for n match nonterminals. <p> During the training process, only the probabilities of the productions were reestimated and no nonterminals or productions were added or deleted, unlike "model surgery" in our HMM work <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A stochastic grammar specifies a probability for each production in the grammar and thus assigns a probability to each string (sequence) it derives. Stochastic regular grammars are equivalent to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and suggest an interesting generalization from HMMs 1 to stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) <ref> [20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our method is closely related to the "covariance models" (CMs) of Eddy and Durbin [26]. CMs are equivalent to SCFGs but the algorithms for training and producing multiple alignments differ. An in-depth comparison of the two methods is given elsewhere <ref> [27] </ref>. In this paper, we focus on validating the use of SCFGs to model RNA by applying them to tRNA. <p> For the discrimination experiments, we generated 2016 non-tRNA test sequences from the non-tRNA features (including mRNA, rRNA, and CDS) in NewGenBank 75.0+ and GenBank75.0. We created 20 non-tRNA sequences for each sequence length between 20 to 120 bases. 3 The Tree-Grammar EM algorithm <ref> [27, 24] </ref> was used to reestimate the probability parameters in this initial grammar using varying numbers of unfolded and unaligned tRNA training sequences (Figure 3). <p> As can be seen from the case of Part III tRNAs, a grammar clearly gains discriminative power from being trained on a large and varied sequence set. 4 Discussion Recently, formal language theory has been proposed as a means for examining RNA <ref> [24, 27, 17, 26] </ref>. Here we have applied SCFGs to tRNA and shown that they provide a flexible and highly 9 Disc. Align.

These grammars are able to discriminate regular mitochondrial tRNA from non-tRNAs quite well. However, only 50% of the Part III tRNAs can be reliably distinguished from non-tRNAs even by our most heavily trained grammars.

Reference-contexts: The results indicate that the tRNA SCFG model appears to be a good discriminator. A detailed examination of the SCFG produced secondary structures and alignments indicates that they agree extremely well with previously determined ones <ref> [28] </ref>. 2 Methods 2.1 Overview of SCFG modeling of RNA sequences A context-free language is simply a set of sequences of characters drawn from an alphabet and specified through a representation called a grammar. Formally, a grammar is composed of three parts. <p> d-arm-loop Loop 8 rest4 2BranchR btw23 rest5 btw23 Loop 1 rest5 2BranchRNec anti-codon rest6 anti-codon Helix 5 anti-codon-loop anti-codon-loop Loop 7 rest6 2BranchR variable rest7 variable Loop 7 rest7 2BranchL nothing t-arm t-arm Helix 5 t-arm-loop t-arm-loop Loop 7 nothing Loop 1 based upon the previously described structure of tRNA <ref> [28] </ref>. The loop (circle), helix (rectangle) and Branch (lines connecting helices and loops) meta-nonterminals have associated lengths and sets of productions. <p> These probability values are initialized to default prior values and then reestimated during training on actual sequences, as are all the parameters of the grammar. 2.3 Data, training and testing The sequences and alignments of 1477 tRNAs were taken from the database of Sprinzl and coworkers <ref> [28] </ref> (referred to as Trusted) and an updated and revised version of this compilation (TrustedNew) (R. Cedergren, personal communication). Modified bases were converted to their unmodified form. <p> The predicted alignment agrees substantially with the Trusted alignment <ref> [28] </ref>: boundaries of helices 3 The original size of the data set was 2020 because we discarded four anomalous tRNAs that appeared in this set of non-tRNAs through unusual labeling in GenBank.

Reference-contexts: Since a grammar often gives several possible secondary structures for one RNA sequence, a dynamic-programming procedure is used to provide the most likely parse tree. This procedure, which resembles the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs <ref> [29] </ref>, is also used to obtain multiple sequence alignments in a manner similar to that described for HMMs in [19]. 2.2 Initial tRNA grammar A tRNA meta-grammar was created using the known structure of tRNA and employed to generate the probabilities and productions for an intial grammar (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: These probability distributions, like those above for the match nonterminals in the loops, are initially defined using Dirichlet priors (see <ref> [30] </ref>). Further nonterminals and productions are added to allow deletions of base pairs, enabling length variations in helices. Currently, no special insertion productions are generated to allow for bulges as in the grammars of Durbin and Eddy [26].

Reference-contexts: The main difficulties in applying this work to other families of RNA will be the development of appropriate initial grammars and the computational cost of parsing longer sequences. The latter problem can only be solved by the development of fundamentally different parsing methods, perhaps relying more on branch-and-bound methods <ref> [40] </ref> or heuristics. It is currently not clear which approach will be best. The former problem might be solved by the development of effective methods for learning the grammar itself from training sequences.

One possibility would be to consider stochastic graph grammars (see the introductory survey by Engelfriet and Rozenberg [44]) in hopes of obtaining a more general model of the interactions present in the molecule beyond the primary structure.
