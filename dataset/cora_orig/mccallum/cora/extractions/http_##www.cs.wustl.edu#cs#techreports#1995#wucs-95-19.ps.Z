Abstract: EUPHORIA Reference Manual Washington University Department of Computer Science bered that EUPHORIA is part of a distributed system; if the EUPHORIA module monopolizes the CPU, external modules will run slower which, in turn, will make EUPHORIA run slowly. Also, if other modules update their variables repeatedly at a rate faster than the update rate of EUPHORIA, time is still spent dealing with the intermediate values of the variables even though the values may be skipped over. External modules should utilize Playgrounds PGsleep [4] to adjust their speed to a reasonable rate, and should avoid resending redundant information. We thank the EUPHORIA users of the Washington University CS333 class for their useful comments. We also thank David Saff, who is in the process of developing constraint visualization and editing for EUPHORIA. We thank Bala Swaminathan and Ram Sethuraman for their work in developing the Playground library. [1] Kenneth J. Goldman, Michael D. Anderson, and Bala Swaminathan.
